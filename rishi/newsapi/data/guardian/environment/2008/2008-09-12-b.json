  "<p>We are former Liberal Democrat candidates and elected representatives who have found that the aims and aspirations that drew us into politics are now best represented by the Conservatives led by David Cameron. On a wide range of issues, the Conservative party is now providing a progressive, liberal, modern alternative to Labour. David Cameron has brought the environment to the top of the political agenda and has realistic, achievable plans for decentralising energy and catalysing the use of clean coal. He leads the most coherently localist party too, with ambitious plans to transfer power from the centralised state to local people; from bureaucrats to frontline professionals. </p> <p>The Conservative party recognises that the tax burden is too high and has sensible, costed proposals to ease that burden on our wealth-creating businesses, and on families being hit by inheritance tax. Its radical proposals for a pupil premium for the most disadvantaged will empower parents and deliver the educational standards their children deserve. And unlike Labour, it is not casual with our historic civil liberties, opposing both ID cards and 42-day detention for terror suspects. </p> <p>We strongly believe a Conservative victory at the next election is the only way of getting rid of this tired, discredited and illiberal Labour government. </p> <p>So we urge our former colleagues to consider joining us in channelling our efforts towards bringing about the change Britain needs.</p> <p><strong>Sajjad Karim MEP </strong>(North West), <strong>Cllr Dave Shilton </strong>(Warwickshire county council), <strong>Cllr John Lock </strong>(Plymouth), <strong>Cllr Faraz Bhatti</strong> (Manchester) and <strong>15 others</strong></p>",

  "<p>Here we have a well-trodden travel motif taken to its ultimate conclusion: a writer following in his own footsteps. More than 30 years ago, the American author Paul Theroux looped on a series of trains from London to the farthest reaches of Asia and back. His 1981 account of that journey, The Great Railway Bazaar, became an international bestseller. It was the book that made him and launched fleets of other people's travel books. In this new tome, Theroux repeats the experience.</p> <p>Geopolitics alter the route: the author is refused a visa into Iran, avoids Afghanistan, and so on. Beginning again in London, he takes to the rails through central Europe and Turkey, continuing across various central Asian republics, India, southeast Asia and Japan. Choosing to avoid China, as he loathes the thought of its \"honking\" greed for development, he flies from Niigata to Vladivostok, and from there rattles back over Russia on the Trans-Siberian Express. </p> <p>Theroux likes Istanbul (\"a city with the soul of a village\") and swoons at the Asiatic glamour of Hanoi, which he visits here for the first time, though the stories he hears from witnesses of the 1972 Christmas bombing are among the most harrowing in the book. But on the whole he hates cities and yearns for the wilderness, like his hero Thoreau. \"In Tokyo,\" he observes, \"everyone looks as though they'd all received the same memo: Walk fast and look worried\"; whereas the snow-covered emptiness of northern Hokkaido is \"the landscape of my dreams\". India (87 pages) and Japan (56 pages) receive the most attention, but as in his best travel books (The Old Patagonian Express, for example, and the African odyssey Dark Star Safari), the brilliance lies in the author's ability to create a broad sweep of many countries - a sequence of close-up shots that form a semi-global panorama.</p> <p>There are no historical tracts. Mostly, the book describes the author's personal responses while nothing much happens. We see him eating, reading and doing crosswords, visiting the dentist or having a haircut. He gets drunk a lot less than he did in Bazaar, and gets up earlier. Occasionally he interviews or meets up with other celebrated authors: Orhan Pamuk in Turkey, Haruki Murakami in Tokyo and the late Arthur C Clarke in Sri Lanka, the latter wearing a T-shirt saying, \"I invented the satellite and all I got was this lousy T-shirt\". The interaction with Murakami (who translated Theroux's novel World's End) is the longest and most revealing, but in the end the luminaries play walk-on roles: the stars are the rickshaw wallah, the monk in the next seat, the exhausted prostitute. Theroux allows them to speak for themselves. Although he visits a few ancient sites - Merv, for example, in the Karakum wasteland - it is people who compel Theroux. Never seduced by propaganda, he recognises that it is the man at the bottom of the heap who tells the truest truth about his land. Anyway, he is far too accomplished a writer to need glittering set-pieces. </p> <p>Some places have changed, some have stayed the same, others have gone backwards. Joginder's greasy caf\u00e9 and pastry shop has become Joginder's greasy internet caf\u00e9 and pastry shop. Bangalore, \"sleepy and bungaloidal\" on Theroux's last visit, has become the driver of the fabled \"Indian economic miracle\". Visiting the call centres in which Indians advise Californians on problems with their cellphones, the author is sceptical of a miracle that leaves 400 million people below the poverty line. Burma almost breaks his heart. His description of Cambodia almost broke mine. As Theroux observes, the existence of museums of Khmer Rouge horrors suggests that Cambodia has reformed, which is not true. </p> <p>He puts the boot into the Chinese leadership and notes ruefully that, on the whole 28,000-mile trip, he met two people who support George Bush. But he encounters little personal hostility. Most ordinary people are good, Theroux concludes in his last paragraph, and that gives him hope. Perhaps that is why he prefers the simple lodging to the palazzo. \"Luxury is the enemy of observation,\" he notes, a demoralising revelation. But luxury is not his instinct. \"At the sight of all this filth and disorder,\" he writes on discovering the restaurant car on the express to Bucharest, \"my spirits rose.\" He likes to see \"countries with their trousers down\", and when told that Wakkanai is boring, he responds: \"Sounds like my kind of place.\"</p> <p>As always, he is omnipresent in the narrative - a signature of his style. It is the opposite of that other master, Norman Lewis, who appears in his travel books only as an agent of the material. Fortunately for the reader, Theroux has the gift of self-awareness. \"In some well-hidden part of the traveller's personality,\" he surmises, \"is an unpickable knot of vanity, presumption and mythomania bordering on the pathological.\" Travel writing he calls \"the lowest form of literary self-indulgence\". In Vientiane, an English backpacker assumes Theroux must long to be Michael Palin. Imagine Chatwin admitting that.</p> <p>Theroux refers to the trip as \"a sentimental journey\", and he shares Sterne's delight in the sad absurdities of life. He can be tender. The emotional climax of Ghost Train unfolds halfway through, at Candacraig, the Raj \"chummery\" in Burma where single men from the army or civil service used to take leave. In Bazaar Theroux wrote lovingly of the chief steward there, and on the return visit is embraced by the man's elderly children. In the perfumed rooms of Candacraig he experienced \"the past recaptured, like a refuge . . . it was the sort of reunion I had hoped for when I set out to repeat my trip\". Then he reflects touchingly: \"Nothing like this had ever happened to me among my own family.\"</p> <p>Theroux is a fabulously good writer with an almost perfect ear for the rhythm of his prose. \"The century-old station at Haydarpasa,\" chapter 4 begins, \"was floodlit and looked like an opera house on the night I crossed the Bosporus to take the night express to Ankara.\" He has not lost his touch when it comes to conjuring topography. The sun rises in Bucharest \"like a coddled egg\", Turkish roads have a \"somnolent nobility\", and his passage on the ripened, feathery cycads and tall old palms of Sinhalese gardens is magisterial. Like everything Theroux writes (to date 27 works of fiction and 15 of non-fiction), Ghost Train is agreeably spiced with literary references, mostly from the usual crew - Yeats, Conrad, Larkin - though he takes trouble to involve lesser-known indigenous writers, too. </p> <p>It turns out that Theroux was miserable the whole time on the first trip (\"though I made the book jolly\") because his wife had taken a lover; he makes a meal here of the fact that he threatened to kill both her and her boyfriend. He reveals that he re-ordered facts to suit the prose: for example, whereas he actually met an important character in Bazaar in a guesthouse, he pretended that he encountered him on the train \"because I wanted to give my trip some drama\". All travel writers do that, but most can't admit it. And why should the reader care? It's art, not life.</p> <p>\"The greatest difference,\" Theroux writes when comparing the two journeys, \"was in me. I had survived the long road that leads to the present.\" When he set out for the second time he was twice the age of the person who wrote Bazaar. He acknowledges lower expectations, a contempt for political promises, and - crucially, I think, for the creative imagination - the fact that \"after a certain age the traveller stops looking for another life\". Elegiac acceptance informs the tone of every line of this book. Its author is a happier man now, and one who moans a lot less, but, more significantly for the narrative, he is also an older one.</p> <p>Funny, informative and lyrical, this is a portrait of half the world in light and shade by a writer who still cannot be challenged in the field he reinvented. Although I loved The Great Railway Bazaar, I love Ghost Train to the Eastern Star more - and that, of course, is because I am older too.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sara Wheeler's Too Close to the Sun: The Life and Times of Denys Finch Hatton is published by Vintage</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday September 23 2008.

  "<p>Davina Gounden is completing her master's degree in migration studies at Queen Mary, University of London and she is keen to work for an international organisation. \"My first degree was very general, so I wanted to study something that was more specific,\" she explains. \"I did my undergraduate dissertation on immigration in France and found it very interesting, so I wanted to keep studying that. The course covers everything from theories of migration to the simple facts of just why you get movements of people from different countries.\" She is also trilingual and enthusiastic about working in different places. \"I can speak English, French and Spanish,\" she says. \"Working abroad wouldn't be a problem for me at all.\"</p> <p>We asked Amelia Bookstein Kyazze, head of humanitarian policy at Save The Children UK, to mock-interview Gounden for an entry-level job. Then we asked her what she thought. </p> <p>\"Save The Children is one of the largest humanitarian and development organisations in the world,\" she explains. \"We work in about 100 countries doing rapid response or development work, all based on the framework of children's rights.\"</p> <p>Bookstein Kyazze explains that her team works on a variety of projects. \"It can be very fast, responding to disasters,\" she says, \"or working on slow onset problems or long-term human rights abuses. We work out how to research and work with the media and with policy makers, and we translate that into communications with governments, the UN, our supporters and the press.\" She emphasises that people she works with need to be able to recognise opportunities and risks quickly, and be able to think strategically. \"You need a good idea of what is going on in the world,\" she says, \"to be able to pull ideas together.</p> <p>\"We're definitely looking for problem solvers, for people who can go into stressful situations and can operate in that environment, and people who are cheerful, that's always a good sign.\" She also looks for people who are knowledgeable about Save the Children. \"People who know why we're different and know about our campaigns,\" she says. </p> <p>Good communication skills, a positive approach and a willingness to think about the audience you're trying to reach are also key, as is enthusiasm. \"We're really ambitious here and you must want to be part of something big.\"</p> <p>Gounden came across well in the interview, says Bookstein Kyazze. \"She described herself as determined, and I think she probably is.\"</p> <p>The fact that Gounden speaks three languages is a \"huge asset\" says Bookstein Kyazze, \"but she needs to work on how she sells herself a bit more. It took us a while to find out that she'd volunteered at a children's charity and done work experience at the Mauritian embassy in Spain.\" </p> <p>Gounden also revealed an interest in relevant media. \"She was able to list all these documentaries she's seen and talk very well about them. That would be a real advantage in a media role, for example, and she seemed not to realise that it was unusual and good.\"</p> <p>Because of her academic background, Gounden's skills would also mean she was well placed for a research role. \"She should remember to always make a connection between her work and what we do,\" advises Bookstein Kyazze. </p> <p>Gounden found the interview a useful experience. \"I was a bit nervous,\" she says, \"but they were really nice, even though it was a formal interview.\" Most helpful to her was being interviewed by specialists in the same area as she had been studying. \"I've never had an interview with people so close to my own area of research before,\" she says, \"so it was really helpful to have an idea about the kind of questions I'll be asked in future interviews.\"</p> <p>If you are an undergraduate or recent graduate in need of a career blind date, send your CV to graduate@theguardian.com </p> <h2>Questions asked</h2> <p>\u00b7 What would you say are the most pressing humanitarian debates and issues today? </p> <p>\u00b7 What would the differences be between writing a master's degree and writing material for Save the Children?</p> <p>\u00b7 How familiar are you with production technologies?

  "<p>Sarah Palin, who presents herself as half of a Republican team of maverick reformers, yesterday edged away from her outmoded views on climate change, conceding for the first time that the problem might be man-made.</p> <p>The admission from Palin, during an interview with ABC television, brings the Republican running mate into line with the views of the party's presidential nominee, John McCain. \"I'm attributing some of man's activities to potentially causing some of the changes in the climate right now,\" she told ABC's Charlie Gibson.</p> <p>The statement contradicted Palin's assertions within the past year that she did not believe global warming is a result of human activity. The Alaska governor strenuously denied expressing such doubts in her ABC interview, but she told the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner newspaper last December: \"I'm not an Al Gore, doom-and-gloom environmentalist blaming the changes in our climate on human activity.\" </p> <p>Even so, yesterday's acknowledgment of a human component in climate change was grudging - and Palin still supports drilling in the Arctic wilderness preserve, which McCain opposes. </p> <p>She also suggested that agreeing on the causes of climate change bore no relation to finding a solution, and left open the possibility that the phenomenon was merely cyclical. \"Regardless of the reason for climate change, whether it's entirely, wholly caused by man's activities or is part of the cyclical nature of our planet ... John McCain and I agree that we gotta do something about it.\"</p> <p>The exchange came during a series of three interviews Palin granted to ABC, her only exposure to the national media since McCain chose her as his running mate a fortnight ago.</p> <p>Most of Palin's responses during those interviews seemed carefully scripted, almost a recitation of Republican talking points absorbed during intense cramming sessions with McCain campaign aides.</p> <p>Critics saw her performance as evidence that she was not conversant with many of the issues that would occupy a vice-president, especially matters of foreign policy. She was on shaky ground on several occasions. At a military ceremony on Thursday, Palin again clung to an outmoded world view, linking the Iraq war to al-Qaida and the 9/11 attacks. The Washington Post reported that Palin told a contingent of troops deploying to Iraq, including her son, Track, that they would \"defend the innocent from the enemies who planned and carried out and rejoiced in the death of thousands of Americans\".</p> <p>Palin exposed other gaps on national security issues. She told ABC that Washington should not intervene if Israel decided to attack Iranian nuclear facilities, and she adopted a far more hawkish posture towards Russia than Bush, going so far as to commit US troops to the defence of Georgia and Ukraine if attacked.</p> <p>Yesterday, Barack Obama's camp was scouring the transcripts of the Palin interviews as part of what it called a bold new strategy to counter a string of Republican attacks. The change of tack comes after mounting Democratic concerns that Obama is not hitting back hard enough. </p> <p>The Republicans have made a number of false assertions against Obama, accusing him of personally insulting Palin by using the phrase \"lipstick on a pig\" to describe McCain's economic policies and of supporting explicit sex education for five-year-olds.</p>",
  "<p>The good times rolled last year for top executives in American boardrooms, pocketing solid pay rises in spite of the credit crunch, the sub-prime mortgage crisis and early signs of an economic slump.</p> <p>A veteran Silicon Valley technology entrepreneur topped the remuneration table. Larry Ellison, founder and chief executive of the business software company Oracle, took home $84.6m (\u00a348m).</p> <p>The billionaire America's Cup sailing fanatic fought off stiff competition to take the top-paid title. According to analysis by Associated Press, the 10 highest earners in the US included the bosses of three investment banks - Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - and three energy and mining firms buoyed up by soaring commodity prices.</p> <p>Straitened economic conditions in the US only modestly dented the annual boardroom bonanza. A survey by Hay Group for the Wall Street Journal found compensation rose 3.5% to an average of $8.85m among chief executives of 200 top US corporations. There were few examples, however, of standout pay packages. Nobody made it into nine figures last year unlike, for example, Home Depot's Robert Nardelli who secured a $210m severance package in 2006, or Richard Fairbank of credit card firm Capital One, who scooped $280m in 2005.</p> <p>\"I don't think we've seen any particularly significant cases in the last 12 months,\" said Ryan Johnson, of employment consultants WorldatWork. The reason was straightforward - the stockmarket had a tough year which meant executive share options fared poorly.</p> <p>\"Most of the major indices were down 10% or 15% which meant you didn't have as much cashing in as usual,\" said Johnson. \"The amount of equity most US executives now have ties their personal compensation to the share price.\"</p> <p>The pay league runner-up was Merrill Lynch's John Thain who got a generous signing-on package when moving from the New York Stock Exchange. Thain received $83.1m despite the bank's losses of $19bn on mortgage-related securities, which have prompted it to sell assets and raise money from Asian sovereign wealth funds.</p> <p>In third place was Leslie Moonves of television network CBS - the maker of hits such as CSI and Everybody Loves Raymond - who got $67.6m. Behind him were the bosses of metals group Freeport-McMoRan and energy company XTO.</p> <p>US investors are not entitled to vote on executive pay packages in the way their counterparts in Britain are. Efforts to institute a \"say on pay\" vote by shareholders at annual meetings have largely failed, with a few exceptions - such as at computer maker Apple, telecoms firm Verizon and video rental empire Blockbuster - where resolutions have passed against the wishes of the board.</p> <p>Several vocal pressure groups continue to push for pay restraint. A report from the US Institute for Policy Studies, together with United for a Fair Economy, this week concluded taxpayers in effect subsidise boardroom pay to the tune of $20bn annually through loopholes allowing companies to pay executives offshore, to minimise capital gains tax or defer taxation.</p> <p>Sarah Anderson, co-author of the study, said the rewards enjoyed by energy bosses were attracting particular ire. \"They've really been cashing in even though executives admit they don't have any control over global oil prices.\" </p> <p>The presidential election has provided hope for campaigners. Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain say they support legislation presently stalled in Congress which would require companies to hold a \"say on pay\" vote annually.</p> <p>Obama favours closing a so-called \"carried interest\" loophole which limits capital gains tax on fees and bonuses. </p> <p>McCain has railed against \"rewards for failure\", when outgoing chief executives get huge payoffs, telling a group of small business leaders in June: \"Something is seriously wrong when the American people are left to bear the consequences of reckless corporate conduct, while the offenders themselves are packed off with another $40m or $50m for the road.\"</p>",
  "<p>Authors are often asked where they get their ideas from. Some will say that their plots come from newspapers, others simply from their imaginations. Most often, I think, fiction is derived from an anecdote told by a friend, though not perhaps with the intent of its being used as the basis of a story or novel. So it was with the journalist and folklorist Bertram Fletcher Robinson, who entertained his friend Sir Arthur Conan Doyle with horror stories of Devon while they were together on a golfing holiday. He told him legends of the spectral hounds that were said to roam Dartmoor, phantom creatures with red eyes, whose huntsman is Satan.</p> <p>\"My dear Robinson,\" Conan Doyle wrote to him later, \"It was your account of a west country legend which first suggested the idea of this little tale to my mind. For this, and for the help which you gave me in its evolution, all thanks.</p> <p>\"Yours most truly, A Conan Doyle.\"</p> <p>The story was The Hound of the Baskervilles and, to the great delight of Conan Doyle's readers - they were legion - Sherlock Holmes was its protagonist. Nothing unusual in that, perhaps, but for the fact that his creator had apparently killed Holmes years before. In 1896 he wrote of his detective: \"I have had such an overdose of him that I feel towards him as I do towards p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras, of which I once ate too much, so that the name of it gives me a sickly feeling to this day.\"</p> <p>All in all, he wrote 56 short stories and four novels about Holmes, two narrated by Holmes himself, others in the third person and the rest told by Dr Watson. No wonder that, by the early 1890s, he wanted to try his hand at something else, in this case historical romances. \"It is with a heavy heart that I take up my pen,\" he has Watson begin what he hoped might be the final Holmes story, \"to write these last words in which I shall ever record the singular gifts by which my friend Mr Sherlock Holmes was distinguished.\" And Watson goes on to chronicle what Conan Doyle - with what relief we can imagine - called the \"final problem\". It is time for Holmes to confront his arch-enemy, the international crook Dr Moriarty, and he does so in Switzerland above a fearsome cascade, the Reichenbach Falls. For his friend and biographer Holmes has left a farewell note, anchored to a rock by his silver cigarette case. \"Any attempt at recovering the bodies was absolutely hopeless, and there, deep down in that dreadful cauldron of swirling water and seething foam, will lie for all time the most dangerous criminal and the foremost champion of the law of their generation.\" The cynical reader may say that Holmes's creator was leaving the way open for a possible resurrection of the nation's hero. </p> <p>Not that he ceased writing about Holmes once he had disposed of him. Publishers, editors and readers were dismayed by the great detective's death and, in an attempt to pacify them, he composed a Holmes play. It opened in Buffalo, New York, in 1899, toured all over the United States and was produced two years later in London. But although it was a success and a command performance was staged for King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra - the king was said to be a great admirer of Conan Doyle's early Holmes fiction - it failed to satisfy his public. They wanted more Holmes serials and more Holmes stories.</p> <p>Readers notoriously find it difficult, if not impossible, to imagine that their favourite authors can grow tired of a series character. For their part, they never tire and suppose that the writer is as spellbound by the hero he has created as they are. Conan Doyle was persuaded of this and at last he restored his detective to the public in fiction form. The first episode of the story or novella which he published in 1901 appeared in August. Queues formed outside the Strand magazine's offices and at bookstalls. Its circulation rose overnight by 30,000 copies. Holmes was alive again, or at least another story had been retrieved from Watson's casebook; for Holmes's chroncicler makes it plain that he is not bringing his friend back to life, only recounting a tale which had never found its way into print before. </p> <p>In his introduction to the Penguin Complete Sherlock Holmes, Christopher Morley writes of literature's most famous detective: \"Perhaps no fiction character ever created has become so charmingly real to his readers.\" Holmes, in spite of his absence from his author's pages for so long, had lost none of his charm, energy and intellectual brilliance on his reappearance. We find him, as we always wish to do, at home in 221B Baker Street in conversation with Watson, in this case at breakfast. Holmes is putting his sidekick through a rather patronising test to see if he has assimilated what he calls his \"methods\". Watson is to analyse the character of a doctor who called on the previous day, by studying the walking stick he has inadvertently left behind. This he does about as well as Holmes expects, which is about a quarter as well as he would have done had he studied the famous methods properly. The scene is thus ready for the arrival, soon to take place, of the anxious visitor, desperate to consult the one man in London he knows can solve \"a most serious and extraordinary problem\". This caller turns out to be a doctor of medicine, practising on Dartmoor. </p> <p>Himself a doctor, Conan Doyle was working as a general practitioner in Plymouth at the time, so he was in a position easily to explore the area. Making preparations for the novella based on his friend's ghost story, he went with Fletcher Robinson on a trip to the moor. They stayed at the Duchy Hotel at Princetown and made forays into the surrounding countryside where the author saw bronze age settlements, Fox Tor, the grim prison itself and, of course, those bogs in which it was said any human being or animal straying into them would be fatally sucked down into their murky depths. He soon had material for his story, taking its title from the name of a Baskerville who had married into a local family or, perhaps, from Harry Baskerville, the coachman who had driven Conan Doyle and Robinson's pony and trap about Dartmoor. Whichever it was, the end product became one of the most famous stories ever written.</p> <p>An author who relied to some extent on formula, Conan Doyle often featured in his fiction a protagonist who returned to his homeland after half a lifetime in foreign parts. These exotic countries would most usually be America, India, Australia or South Africa, giving him the opportunity to make his main character a prospector for gold or adventurer in some local war. Some protagonists return to exact revenge on the man or woman who, all those years before, was instrumental in sending them away - a few as blackmailers, others because they have inherited a fortune or a property in England. Such a one is the young Sir Henry Baskerville, who seems to have lived most of his life in America and Canada and, as a result of the deaths of two or three possible heirs, finds himself the owner of Baskerville Hall. His is \"the serious and extraordinary problem\". In spite of being told of his likely fate should he take possession, Sir Henry is determined to \"go to the home of his fathers\", a vast and gloomy pile in the middle of Dartmoor. Conan Doyle is said to have based it on his old school, Stonyhurst, in Lancashire. </p> <p>\"The avenue opened,\" he writes, \"into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay before us. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a heavy block of a building, from which a porch projected. The whole front was draped in ivy, with a patch clipped here and there where a window or a coat of arms broke through the dark veil. From this central block rose the twin towers, ancient, crenellated and pierced with many loopholes ... A dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high chimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a single black column of smoke.\"</p> <p>Indoors, the dining room \"was a place of shadow and gloom. It was a long chamber with a step separating the dais where the family sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependants. At one end a minstrels' gallery overlooked it. Black beams shot across our heads, with a smoke-darkened ceiling beyond them. With rows of flaring torches to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time banquet, it might have softened: but now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one's voice became hushed and one's spirit subdued ... \"</p> <p>Conan Doyle was an expert in setting a scene in which a drama, fraught with menace and horror, will unfold. But he always knows better than to gild the lily or, in this case, overload his narrative with doom, curses and blood-chilling foreboding, as some of his contemporaries would have done. In no story does he describe the countryside with such affectionate care and sensitivity as in The Hound of the Baskervilles. He writes of \"the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands\", of \"the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood\", from which \"there rose in the distance a grey, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged summit, dim and vague ... like some fantastic landscape in a dream\". Later it is of \"black tors\" that he writes, \"craggy summits\" and \"melancholy downs\".</p> <p>Ever since the prison was built on Dartmoor in the early part of the 19th century, in order to house men taken in the Napoleonic wars, it has been almost a given to write of this beautiful region of Devon as if it were unrelievedly grim. And it is true that the place itself must be one of the most unprepossessing buildings in the west country. But Conan Doyle saw, and made his characters see, the secret loveliness of the moor \"when all was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light\", while not neglecting the potential of the prison itself from which escape was so rare, yet the possibility of it such an ever-present threat to the denizens of Dartmoor. He introduced a desperate escaped convict into his story, without whom it could scarcely have been told in the form its author chose for it. He had made good use of his holiday with Robinson. </p> <p>Victorian writers of sensation fiction seem to have enjoyed creating a situation in which spectators or participants suffered from a trauma (though the word was unfamiliar to them) for the rest of their lives as a result of what they had seen. Without overdoing it, Conan Doyle extracts the maximum horror from the scene, told in retrospect, where the \"wild, profane and godless\" Sir Hugo Baskerville is set upon by the hound and slaughtered. Of those who observed it, \"One, it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their days.\" A curse is henceforward laid upon all future heads of the house of Baskerville. </p> <p>So what did the animal look like? \"A foul thing\", is how he describes it, \"a great black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon\". It was \"luminous and ghastly\", having \"dripping jaws\" and \"blazing eyes\". The artist Sidney Paget, who illustrated most of the Sherlock Holmes stories, drew his impression of it for the Strand magazine as it leaps out of its hiding place to savage its victim. Interested readers can see his drawing, magnified to poster size, on the tunnel wall at Baker Street tube station, the Jubilee Line southbound. Conan Doyle's description better fits an Irish wolfhound, but the dog in the picture is surely a German Shepherd.</p> <p>This was the creature destined to plague Baskerville heirs. Needless to say, the intrepid young Sir Henry is not put off by the curse - \"every Baskerville that goes there meets with an evil fate\" - nor by the mysterious death of the previous resident of the hall. And a credible explanation is given for that death. Sir Charles had a bad heart. He died from \"cardiac exhaustion\". Few but his own doctor knew that he had believed in the curse and the doom that overhangs his family. Dr Mortimer himself, on a visit to Sir Charles, has caught a glimpse of what he takes to be a \"large black calf\" and after his sudden death, almost immediately after, comes upon traces around the body.</p> <p>\"Footprints?\" asks Holmes.</p> <p>\"Footprints.\"</p> <p>\"A man's or a woman's?\"</p> <p>Dr Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered:</p> <p>\"Mr Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound.\" </p> <p>This creature, \"the Baskerville demon\", has been seen by several others. All agreed that it was huge, luminous, ghastly and spectral, and \"could not possibly be any animal known to science\". It has brought about a reign of terror in the district. Even the hardiest refuse to cross the moor at night.</p> <p>Almost from the first it is evident that Holmes does not believe in the possibility of a phantom hound. Some human agency is at work here. He mentions devilry, which prompts Watson to ask him if he favours a supernatural explanation. \"The devil's agents,\" replies Holmes, \"may be of flesh and blood, may they not?\" In none of his Holmes stories are ghosts or spirits or demons allowed to intervene, and while this may seem exactly what we should expect from a writer of relatively modern fiction, Conan Doyle himself was not sceptical about paranormal phenomena. He attended spiritualist meetings and s\u00e9ances, and in later life took photographs of beings he believed to be fairies. But they never intruded into his detective fiction. Perhaps he was so deeply subsumed into the character of his most famous creation that when writing of him he was unable to do otherwise than believe in what Holmes believed in or express any convictions alien to Holmes's own.</p> <p>Hound or no hound, when Sir Henry Baskerville takes up his inheritance and goes down to Baskerville Hall, it is Holmes he would have accompany him. However, the detective is otherwise occupied at home. Or so he says. We who are familiar with the stories and Conan Doyle's techniques guess that he has other plans, that he probably intends to follow in disguise and keep his eye on the incumbent of the hall from nearby. He will not go himself, he tells Baskerville, but he will send his faithful assistant. \"There is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place.\" Watson is willing enough, for the promise of adventure is always an attraction to him.</p> <p>Living at the gloomy hall, they will encounter those people Holmes has enumerated as suspects and those he considers \"entirely honest\", Dr Mortimer and his wife among the latter and a clutch of neighbours, local farmers and servants, any of whom may be guilty. Watson is recommended to take his gun with him. \"Keep your revolver near you night and day and never relax your precautions.\" This will be nothing unusual for the doctor. In many, if not all, of the Holmes stories, he takes care to be armed and will draw without hesitation if necessary. The fiction was written at a time, both innocent and sophisticated, when possessing firearms was almost indispensable in a gentleman. Holmes and Watson sometimes put an end to adversaries' lives, but no action ever seems to be taken against them. Perhaps these killings were regarded as judicial executions. In earlier stories Inspector Lestrade and his henchmen distrust Holmes's methods but later on the police show a respect for him just this side of idolatry. </p> <p>Yet those were the days when the British were famous for not arming their policemen. Today police officers bear arms in many situations and the machine-guns they carry pass almost unnoticed, while for a member of the public to possess even a 12-bore shotgun requires a licence, separate storage for the weapon from its ammunition, police inspections and other involved procedures. Watson quite casually carries his pistol in his pocket, as does Holmes his revolver, and it is as well they do in this case, so that side by side in a tight corner as they so often are, they can deal death to this creature which is \"as large as a small lioness\". And see too that justice is meted out to the human perpetrators. </p> <p>The outcome is no great surprise to the astute reader. But, as in all good mystery stories, this is unimportant. It is the characters that count, the sinister setting and the enduring marvel of Holmes's deductive powers. That his \"methods\" often fail to stand up - the preponderance of footprints as an immediate clue to identification, for instance - does nothing to lessen the entertainment they bring the reader. It is the same with his ability to detect the profession, marital status, domicile and much of the life history of a stranger come to seek his help before the newcomer even opens his or her mouth. He does it from the appearance of a shoe, the stain on a coat sleeve, a pair of spectacles. Often, some quite other and just as convincing interpretation might be placed on these clues - Watson has probably suggested it already - but we accept Holmes's analysis, for one of Conan Doyle's achievements is that we trust him. We trust this invented detective that many people to this day believe really existed, as much as we trust the words and opinions of experts writing in the newspapers. </p> <p>With The Hound of the Baskervilles, Conan Doyle brought Holmes back - in a manner of speaking. The explanation that this was a memoir of his friend that Watson was writing, not an account of a recent adventure, was inadequate for Holmes's millions of fans. The detective had to be resurrected and restored to his public, so Conan Doyle artfully contrived an outcome for the Reichenbach Falls encounter different from that which Watson and his public had been led to believe. When in Moriarty's clutches Holmes used his knowledge of baritsu, \"the Japanese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very useful to me\", and threw the professor into the abyss. His author brought him back for the collection called The Return of Sherlock Holmes and, later, for His Last Bow with a preface by Dr John H Watson MD: \"The friends of Mr Sherlock Holmes will be glad to learn that he is still alive and well, though somewhat crippled by occasional attacks of rheumatism ...\"</p> <p>Disabling illness sits uneasily with the vigorous athlete and intellectual giant we knew, but perhaps he had overdone the baritsu in earlier days. A remarkable aspect of these stories is that, though some are superior to others, none is very inferior and, above all, there is no noticeable decline in their quality as their author grew tired of his creation. The Hound of the Baskervilles is one of the best of them and a good introduction to the world's most famous detective.</p>",
  "<p>If the 19th century was about controlling the environment, then the 20th was about admitting how it controls us in return: \"One is not duchess / A hundred yards from a carriage,\" wrote Wallace Stevens, crystallising in a single line any number of cultural and sociological drives, from Leninism to linguistic relativity. Christopher Middleton, now in his 80s, whose early publishing career overlapped for a decade with Stevens's, is one of the few British poets to have kept exploring this Modernist territory right up to the present day, as his vast and inventive Collected Poems shows. \"I exalt a space ripening and continuous,\" he writes; and such spaces are not just physical, not just the interior of a house or the shape of a dress (he has a wonderful poem, \"Chanel Always Now\", on the rise of the fickle fashion industry), but imagined and spoken, too. </p> <p>This is perhaps to be expected from a linguist. Having spent his academic career at the University of Texas as a professor of modern languages, Middleton is well aware of the different worlds available to different tongues, and better equipped than most to resist his own centrality. The poems hardly ever come from a distinct poetic \"I\", but instead are turned outwards to explore the \"developable surfaces\" that lie all around. He models for us all manner of landscapes - Cornwall; Texas; a tussock moth's wings; shipyards; refugee camps; the interior of a nude photograph, where mystery is \"buttressed at one end by the puckered wall / of stone and plaster, at the other end / by the gaze exploring all without distress\". Seemingly untrammelled by his own nationality, Middleton's visions of Italy, Mexico and Russia are equally bold and convincing: \"at the valley's other end a slope of roofs / this maze long abandoned by the tinkling animals / old stone room inhaling all the winds\" (\"Petrarch's Country\").</p> <p>Environment leads, naturally enough, to ecology: Middleton has amassed many poems that might now retrospectively be folded into the emergent \"ecopoetry\". \"Old Woman at the County Dump\" describes someone who lives among \"All the stuff / people have left, beyond and behind, / marching toward a world of absolute deodorants, / infallible laxatives\", and would seem to prefigure Derek Mahon's better-known trash poems. Middleton is also drawn to obscure plants (opoponax), reptiles (the coral snake, the anti-basilisk) and insects, and merely by considering them intelligently, no hand-wringing whatsoever, makes plain how much they enrich our world. An early poem, \"The Greenfly\", which reads as freshly as if it were written yesterday, considers how the singularity of a greenfly on a train window makes it impossible to kill: \"Some evenings I squirt / Swarms of your kind with a reliable poison. / Here it may not be the same.\" The poem effortlessly reaches back, towards the battlefields of the second world war, as well as forwards into the future, where \"the killing\" will undoubtedly go on, without ever needing to explain itself. It is enough that the speaker is on a train; it is enough that we, too, want to protect our \"one or two roses\".</p> <p>Such a genteel, orderly piece, being just one facet of Middleton's talent, is inevitably followed by something more resistant. He experiments restlessly, provocatively, with allusion, quotation, typography, tone, only occasionally succumbing to the chaos that all experimental poets risk. His command of idioms, and the huge vocabulary at his fingertips, are quite astonishing; and by letting all fields of reference into his work - from poststructuralism to hick-talk - he offers us poetry equal to the world it depicts, but always with a radical undertow that saves it from being inertly permissive. \"Ballad of the Putrefaction\", from 1996's Intimate Chronicles, tells of an angry poet (referred to as \"himself\") and his plan to write a \"poem of hateful persons, / Nobodies governing nations without any sense of what's what\". Alongside the usual gripes about weapons deals, \"himself\" broods on the absurdity of power and the words in which it's formed:<br></p> <blockquote> <p><br>Typically one who ordered a total <br>change of trees<br>Resenting the way leaves tore loose<br>from a sycamore<br>Himself too mumbled how their<br>language formulaic and glib<br>Formulaic and numb and belittling<br>gave rhetoric a bad name<br>Mouse gray their claptrap squeaking<br>in machines</p> </blockquote> <p>Instead of lampooning the impulse to write a poem that will \"shine through air in the darkest places / So its voices will banish the fug they spread\", Middleton lets it speak for itself, in all its mad glory, and in doing so produces a poem more intelligent and moving than the intended protest rant could ever be.</p> <p>As well as revisiting collections as exciting as The Lonely Suppers of WV Balloon, anyone already familiar with Middleton's work will be pleased to find new poems here, especially the keenly piteous \"Chekhov at Sumy\": \"While he slept, / One lung, or both, might have whistled / So entertainingly, the light-winged / Dryads of the wood joined in.\" Perhaps there are times, in \"The Tenor on Horseback\" for example, where an enthusiasm for continental philosophy or theology can seem to overwhelm the structure in which it appears; but such occasional imbalances are a small price to pay for genuine metaphysical engagement. Anyone who wants to peer into the corners of the language, and who feels they're ready for a challenge, will find enough insight and innovation in this collection to keep them happy for years.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Frances Leviston's Public Dream is published by Picador.</p>",
  "<p>Here is a cautionary tale for anyone working in research. \"Captain Cook and Lord Nelson seem unlikely figureheads in the fight against climate change alarmists,\" said the Sun. \"Lord Nelson and Captain Cook's ship logs question climate change theories,\" announced the Telegraph. Oh that's handy. So perhaps we can just keep on burning oil regardless then? \"The ships' logs of great maritime figures such as Lord Nelson and Captain Cook have cast new light on climate change by suggesting that global warming may not be an entirely man-made phenomenon.\"</p> <p>I spoke to Dennis Wheeler, a geographer at Sunderland University and the man whose research triggered this coverage. Is he a leading figure in \"the fight against climate change alarmists\"?</p> <p>No. \"But now I've had emails from cranks around the world thinking I'm some kind of anti-global warming conspiracy theorist and a friend to them. I'm most certainly not. The newspapers grossly and crassly misrepresented everything we are doing.\"</p> <p>In fact, Wheeler had spoken only to the Sunday Times, which covered his work accurately. The rest of the newspapers copied the quotes, and the information, but rather grandly decided to change the purpose and the outcome of his research. \"It was odd reading articles which were written as if a reporter had spoken to me - I wasn't fully aware of the extent to which the media copy each other's newspapers - but worse was the brazen way they distorted our work. Not a single one of the journalists from any other newspaper contacted us to see if their take on the story was correct.\"</p> <p>In fact, the journalists concocted all kinds of connections entirely for themselves. \"Ships' logs, and thousands more like them, have revealed that recent global warming is not so unusual after all.\" Is that true? \"No. As I pointed out to the Sunday Times, the ships' log books I work with only give us information about wind force and wind direction, they basically do not give us information on temperatures, and if they do it's very scant and unreliable. We've simply never claimed indirectly or directly to have any direct evidence on changing temperatures.\"</p> <p>More from the Telegraph: \"The records also suggest that Europe saw a spell of rapid warming, similar to that experienced today, during the 1730s that must have been caused naturally.\"</p> <p>Wheeler? \"Your heart just sinks. Well, the central England temperature series, for example, have shown us that the 1720s and 1730s are a period of fairly rapid warming, but that's in recovery from the Little Ice Age, and we'd like to know more about that, but this has been known about since 1974. What we are trying to do is to shed a fresh light - a bit of background - on these long-known changes in temperature.</p> <p>\"Somewhere at the end they do quote me, but by then the headlines have done their job, and the message is lost in the willingness of so many people to believe global warming is not a major issue. And by the end it was unclear what my quote meant anyway, in its new context.\"</p> <p>How did the papers quote Wheeler? Thus: \"Global warming is a reality, but our data shows climate science is complex. It is wrong to take particular events and link them to carbon dioxide emissions.\" I could see how that quote might get misunderstood. </p> <p>\"Only out of context. I wasn't talking about the scientific community, I wasn't talking about climate change theory being wrong, I was talking about the media and others getting things wrong. Any new weather event is currently explained away as yet another facet of global warming, but there has always been freak weather.

  "<p>The \"social scourge\" of excessive boardroom pay has prompted widespread debate in the European Union as workers see their purchasing power eroded by rising prices and low wage increases. European political leaders have demanded a legal and fiscal clampdown.</p> <p>Shareholders, especially retail investors, are pressing for greater corporate disclosure of remuneration policy - including links to performance and individual directors' pay packages - as well as votes on the issue at annual meetings.</p> <p>The pay debate has been exacerbated by the credit crunch, which has exposed undue risk-taking in the search for higher bonuses by highly paid investment bankers and high-profile severance packages for failed executives, deepening the sense of outrage in mainland Europe, which is culturally more egalitarian than the US or Britain.</p> <p>Even before Pat Russo, chief executive of serially loss-making IT firm Alcatel-Lucent, quit in late July with a contractual pay-off of up to \u20ac6m (\u00a34.8m), French president Nicolas Sarkozy had produced draft laws to curb such \"golden parachutes\".</p> <p>The Dutch government has introduced legislation for a 30% tax on bonuses of more than \u20ac500,000 and a 15% increase in employer's fiscal contributions to executive pensions, partly influenced by the multimillion pay-off for ABN Amro chief Rijkman Groenink. In Germany, where workers' pay rose only 4.3% between 2003 and 2007 as firms laid off hundreds of thousands of employees, Social Democrats are demanding a \u20ac1m ceiling on tax-deductible boardroom remuneration.</p> <p>It is the widening gap between boardroom and shopfloor remuneration in a deteriorating economic environment that is fuelling the furore. The growing evidence is that mainland European companies are following the lead of their British counterparts by setting executive remuneration packages, including stock options, at a level commensurate with global - not national - peers in an effort to retain and incentivise directors.</p> <p>Executive pay in the EU averages \u20ac5m a year. French chief executives are said to be the highest paid, with packages worth \u20ac6m after a reported 58% leap in 2007. A recent survey by the German DSW investor lobby found that German executive pay had risen 7.75% in 2007 to just below \u20ac3m, with Josef Ackermann of Deutsche Bank the top earner with \u20ac14m, though Wendelin Wiedeking of unlisted Porsche earned more than four times that.</p> <p>It is this degree of corporate generosity that prompted Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the EU's euro group, to label it a \"social scourge\".</p> <p>Disclosure practices vary widely across the European Union despite a four-year-old non-binding European commission recommendation to increase corporate remuneration transparency on individual executive pay and remuneration policies as a whole.</p> <p>A European commission report last year found greater transparency had ensued but responses had been patchy, with only a third of member states enabling even an advisory shareholder vote on executive remuneration. In Germany, where only 40% of the top 30 firms in the Dax have remuneration committees and most annual reports detail only the package of the highest earner, even that stipulation causes anger among directors.</p>",
  "<p>Whenever I think I'm busy, I think of the bee. Worker bees from a single hive will fly some 90,000 miles, sucking up the nectar of two million flowers en route, to produce just 500g of honey. About 70% of our crops are dependent upon or benefit from visits from bees. This is why there is so much concern about the global spread of colony collapse disorder (CCD), where a hive's inhabitants suddenly disappear, leaving only a few young and the queen, like a honey-drenched Miss Havisham, languishing in her hive. </p> <p>I've always been keen to create my own \"bee-loud glade\" here at River Cottage, and now we have three homey hives nestling in the gorse. I have to say I'm pretty pleased with the results - bee-atific, in fact (sorry!). We now have our very own promised land, flowing with milk and honey (although the milk goes straight down the gullet of our Devon Ruby beef calves. Unless it's for my tea, in which case it still comes from the fridge).</p> <p>Imagine just how magical were the first tastes of wild honey, in the centuries before sugar. It's easy to understand why its collectors would brave bee stings for a few ambrosial mouthfuls. Given its divine flavour and miraculous method of production, it's hardly surprising that bees swarm through the Bible. The pharaohs had jars of it in their tombs to sweeten the path to the afterlife and a 15,000-year-old cave painting near Valencia depicts a man rather perilously suspended from ropes or vines, collecting wild honey. We've always loved the sweet stuff.</p> <p>As well as the sweetness, honey has always been thought to have miraculous healing properties. It's one of those foods, like so many fruits, that our instinct just tells us has to be good for us. The science is just catching up. A recent study compared honey with a number of branded cough and cold medicines, and found that honey was the only thing to relieve any symptoms at all. No wonder (and here's a good \"Did you know?\" fact about honey) it's the most shoplifted item in our healthfood shops. Clearly honey is highly prized, and with good reason, by sticky-fingered lentil fiends. So if you've always taken lemon and honey to soothe a sore throat, stick with it. And if you're a cough syrup junkie, make the switch to the natural way. But do, please, cough up at the till.</p> <p>There's a honey for all occasions, from pungent, almost savoury French or Italian chestnut honey to mild lavender and rich heather honeys. Like wine, it holds an essence of place (bees rarely travel more than three or four miles from the hive) and no two honeys are quite the same.</p> <p>I use honey all the time, whizzed into smoothies, trickled over fresh goat's cheese, whipped into mustardy vinaigrettes, spooned into marinades and trickled over tart fruits such as plums and rhubarb before roasting. It'll take the Spartan edge off a bowl of porridge, too, or transform homemade muesli into a sybaritic feast. To turn raspberries or peaches, alone or in combination, into a quick, elegant pudding, scrape the seeds from a vanilla pod into cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, cream it with a good dollop of honey, then pour over the fruit and sprinkle with toasted almonds.</p> <p>Honey adds an extra dimension to baking, too, and not just because of its superlative flavour. Honey is hygroscopic, which means it pulls moisture towards it, so cakes that include it (see the first recipe) stay moist for longer. How about that? But that's enough honey factoids. I hope I've inspired you to get buzzy.</p> <h2>Wholemeal honey cake</h2> <p>This soft, moist, dense, almondy cake, devised by our head chef Gill Meller, is a big hit at River Cottage.

Split the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape most of the seeds into the custard mixture; drop the pod into the custard, too. Stir the custard until it's quite thick and coats the back of a wooden spoon - take it as far as you dare without it curdling. Remove from stove, strain and whip until cold, light and fluffy.</p> <p>In a separate bowl, whip the cream to stiff peaks. Pour the custard over the cream, folding it in gently with a spatula until the mixture is smooth (be careful not to knock the air out of it). Pour into a lidded, plastic container, and freeze for about five hours. Remove from the freezer about 10-15 minutes before serving, so it softens slightly, then scoop into glasses or slice and place on plates, perhaps with a few dollops of whipped cream and a further drizzle of honey alongside.

  "<p>Eva Ibbotson has written books for readers of every age. In this latest novel, she has managed to combine at least three traditions, braiding together with delicacy and skill a school story, a war story and a Ruritanian adventure into a funny, moving and uplifting tale which is sparklingly written and full of excitement.</p> <p>It is easy to identify with her heroine: motherless Tally is brave, friendly, intelligent, and it's not too fanciful to imagine that she is very like Ibbotson herself when young. The author went to Dartington School and its fictional version - here called Delderton - is pretty nearly idyllic, with teachers who might be unusual but who are never boring. Some, indeed, are inspirational. Clemmy, the beautiful former artists' model, and Matteo especially (hardly any surnames in this free environment) are romantic figures with starring roles in the action, which begins when Tally discovers a travelogue about a European country called Bergania, which is trying to stand up to Hitler.</p> <p>Not only does she want to meet the young prince, Karil, whom she first sees in a picture half hidden by white plumes on his hat, but she realises that there is something she can do to show solidarity. So she and her friends arrange to enter a youth dance festival, just to get into Bergania and see what they can do to foster friendship, peace and love. </p> <p>In a parallel narrative, Karil himself is miserable about the death of his father, the stuffiness of the court (hilariously described, even though matters become quite serious later on) and his own lack of freedom. He and Tally meet and become friends at once, and Karil takes Tally to the Dragonfly Pool, which is his refuge and escape.</p> <p>The Nazis arrive on the scene, and punish the Berganians by wrecking the dance festival. What happens after this leads to the most exciting part of the novel, and without giving away the plot, it contains skullduggery of a most amusing kind; scrapes, adventures, misunderstandings, love and friendship and a show in which the myth of Persephone is performed by the children at the school. </p> <p>The novel is full of delights, with characters who are both believable and heroic. Even Pom-Pom, the dog, who plays such an important part in the denouement, is a fully-rounded character, while the aunts are of Wodehouse standard. The language is neither too formal nor too chatty but perfectly poised between the two, and the moral - that friendship can overcome almost every difficulty - is a good one. </p> <p>The fact that the Berganian parts of the story are pure invention presents no problems. The sections based on real places give a strong underpinning of historical fact to the fanciful Ruritanian parts of the tale. This \"pretend\" version of European history is truthful in the ways that matter: it lays out simply and entertainingly the consequences of dictatorship and loss of freedom.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Ad\u00e8le Geras's latest novel for adults is A Hidden Life (Orion).</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps best known for his 1997 first novel, Ingenious Pain, which won the Impac and James Tait Black prizes, Andrew Miller has built up a respectable backlist without quite finding the profile and readership that his early success might have led one to expect. A diligent researcher with a sharp eye for detail, he specialises in emotional withdrawal: whether focusing on an icy 18th-century surgeon or a traumatised 20th-century photographer, he tends to settle on characters whose numbness is really a stalled response to powerful feelings - an inner conflict that his novels duly uncover and, to varying degrees, resolve. Miller writes well about the ordinary sadnesses that weigh on his seemingly affectless heroes, and his historical novels have an enjoyably playful streak. When depicting the near-present, however, he can be dourly portentous, bringing in material - the Rwandan genocide in The Optimists, for example - that is too substantial for his decorously low-key gloom.</p> <p>One Morning Like a Bird, his fifth novel, takes the downbeat style of his last two books to an unexpected setting: pre-war Tokyo. The central character, Yuji Takano, is a young man with pretensions to being a \"literary gentleman\", and his main problem, in 1940, is his father's decision to cut off his allowance. Yuji knows what his contemporaries are being sent to do in China, and has the measure of the nationalists running Japan: his father, a law professor, was drummed out of his job for holding democratic views. But the embattled Takano family can still scrape together enough influence to keep the sickly Yuji out of the army, so instead of keeping an eye on political developments, he spends his days drinking with friends from university, half-heartedly pursuing a hated neighbour's young wife, and fretting about his failure to assemble a follow-up to Electric Dragonfly, his poorly selling book of poems.</p> <p>Writing in the present tense and the third person, Miller sticks scrupulously to Yuji's point of view, which makes it hard at first to orient yourself in the novel's social world. Gradually, though, it's made clear that the reticence and formality that govern the Takano household have little to do with what Yuji thinks of as \"the curious western theory of Oriental inscrutability\". His distant father and housebound mother have been that way since the great earthquake of 1923, which took the life of his adored older brother, Ryuichi. Yuji has found a more approachable father-figure in the person of Monsieur Feneon, a French trader who runs a film club for language students. He's particularly impressed by Feneon's claimed ownership of a manuscript letter from Arthur Rimbaud, though he also takes a detached interest in Feneon's daughter, Alissa, the only western person of his own age he's met.</p> <p>The first third of the book sets all this up in a leisurely fashion. Yuji maunders around, attending family get-togethers and worrying vaguely about the indignity of writing advertising copy. Then, just as the reader is growing impatient with Miller's self-absorbed, passive hero, there are developments on several fronts. A dissolute publisher invites Yuji to write an essay on a fascist writer named Ishihara, who offers the young poet entry to a corrupt artistic circle centred on an ultra-nationalist general. Yuji spends a night with Alissa, treating her coldly afterwards and not noticing that his friend Junzo is in love with her. His hated neighbour is shipped back from China with a missing foot and stories of Japanese atrocities. And each neighbourhood is ordered to prepare for bomber raids - raids that, as the reader already knows, will eventually bring about even more destruction than the earthquake that haunts Yuji's family.</p> <p>Miller's old Tokyo is a densely realised environment. You're soon persuaded that he knows, say, which 1920s jazz records would be found in a dusty cupboard in a quasi-westernised home in the winter of 1940. His writing aims for leanness but frequently rises to a discreet poetic flourish at the end of a paragraph; although there are jokes here and there, the effect overall is rather clinically tasteful. As you'd expect, Yuji is eventually coaxed out of his prolonged emotional immaturity, and Miller writes observantly about the pleasures of early parenthood. But the novel's grand themes - the fallibility of the intelligentsia, the difficulty of living in more than one culture, the choice between art and life - sometimes seem like little more than intellectual grace notes. The war itself ultimately functions as a backdrop, and the over-neat tying up of Miller's plotlines makes his earlier obliqueness look mannered and evasive.</p> <p>His novel is also filled with sly references, some keyed to Yuji's reading, others more contemporary. At one point, Feneon departs for Singapore, where he plans to stay with \"a man called Farrell\" - an allusion to JG Farrell's The Singapore Grip (1978), a novel set in the same period. In contrast to Farrell's cartoonishly sketched soldiers, Miller's Japanese characters are densely believable, and his recreation of their world is a real achievement. At the same time, anyone who's read Farrell's book might wish that Miller had taken a few hints from it and let himself be funnier, messier, more full-blooded.</p>",
  "<p>French Connection, the struggling clothing group, said it was \"disappointed\" to see underlying losses more than double to \u00a35.4m as the company grappled with muted wholesale trade, an underperforming menswear brand and heightened levels of high street discounting and input costs.</p> <p>A strong performance in French Connection's own womenswear lines - comparable sales in Britain and North America up 8% for the six months to July 31 - was entirely offset by continued lacklustre performance from menswear and other lines. Like-for-like sales at the group's stores and concessions were flat.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in French Connection's wholesale business, orders for the spring/summer season had been slow in the UK, though they have recovered since the half-year.

He insisted: \"We need to go significantly backwards from there if we were not to be paying the final dividend.\"</p> <p>French Connection made pre-tax profit for the year to January 31 of \u00a33.1m and paid a full-year dividend of 5p a share.</p> <p>Commenting on current trading, Marks said: \"Expectations are for a continuation of the difficult retail environment ... against this background growth will be difficult to achieve for the second half.\" The company hopes benefits from a new team behind the French Connection menswear business will result in a marked improvement in spring/summer next year. </p> <p>\"Whilst there is some light at the end of tunnel, progress is unlikely to show through until next year at the earliest as a result of the weakening consumer backdrop and margin pressures,\" said Kaupthing analyst Matthew McEachran.</p>",
  "<p><strong>1. People always moan that low-energy bulbs are dim when you first switch them on. </strong>With older bulbs, that was certainly the case, and many people still have these. But technology has improved: modern low-energy bulbs fire up instantly and typically reach their full brightness within a few seconds (except when the room is really cold - then it takes longer). </p> <p><strong>2. Each time you replace an old-fashioned energy-guzzling bulb with an equivalently bright low-energy version </strong>you slash the associated CO2 emissions by about 80%. In addition, over the five or six years that it will typically last, a single low-energy bulb can save you more than \u00a350 in energy bills. If you buy the bulb for \u00a31, that's a return of 5,000% - rather better than the premium bonds. </p> <p><strong>3. A decade ago, low-energy bulbs produced a harsh light. </strong>Today, that's not the case. When the magazine Popular Mechanics asked people to assess the light quality from 10 bulbs, without telling them which was which, all nine low-energy bulbs tested scored more highly - for faces and reading as well as general ambience - than the traditional incandescent bulb used as a benchmark.</p> <p><strong>4. With an old-style 100W bulb, you're effectively switching on a 20W light source and an 80W electric heater. </strong>In warm months, that heat is simply wasted. Even worse, it can increase the demand for fans or air conditioning, thereby wasting even more power. Green lightbulbs, by contrast, convert nearly all the power they consume into light, rather than heat. </p> <p><strong>5. There are many types of low-energy bulbs. </strong>Most are CFLs - compact fluorescent lights - which apply electricity to a tube of gas. This creates UV light inside the bulb, which in turn illuminates the bulb's inner-skin of white phosphor to create visible light. </p> <p><strong>6. And they come in all shapes and sizes,</strong> including globes and candles as well as the less attractive tubular designs.</p> <p><strong>7. What's black, filthy and weighs as much as a sack of cement? </strong>Answer: the coal required to illuminate a single 100W lightbulb for its 1,000-hour working life. In other words, every time you place an old-fashioned bulb in your shopping basket, you're indirectly shovelling a hundredweight of the most polluting fossil fuel into a power-station furnace.</p> <p><strong>8. LEDs are the bulbs of the future. </strong>They are even more efficient than CFLs, but most at present don't produce much light - great for night lights and accent lighting, but not a substitute for regular bulbs.</p> <p><strong>9. What about halogens? </strong>Widely used for recessed downlights and tracked spots, these are more efficient than regular incandescent bulbs, but this benefit is often offset by the number of bulbs installed. Many modern homes have five or more downlighters in a room, and tracked spots often include three or more bulbs in each fitting.</p> <p><strong>10. Ever heard of dichroic halogen bulbs? </strong>These offer the familiar halogen brightness, sparkle and dimmability but last much longer and use up to 30% less power. Another option are mini-CFLs designed to fit within a halogen enclosure. These are less sparkly and may not be dimmable, but they offer plenty of light for a minimal amount of energy. Both options cost more than regular halogens, but they also last many times longer.</p> <p><strong>11. Old-style incandescent globes are being phased out. </strong> Retailers from Tesco to B&amp;Q have agreed to voluntarily phase out 100W globes by January 2009, 60W globes by 2010, and incandescent 60W candles and golfballs by the end of 2011. At some stage the EU will also pass mandatory rules outlawing the least efficient bulbs.</p> <p><strong>12. When this phase-out was announced, there were protests </strong>about the supposed downsides of low-energy alternatives. Some commentators pointed out that CFLs contain mercury, a toxic metal. In fact, there's less mercury inside each bulb than would be emitted directly into the atmosphere by a coal-fired power station producing the extra electricity required by a traditional bulb. So using CFLs can theoretically reduce atmospheric mercury levels.</p> <p><strong>13. That said, it's true that CFLs need to be disposed of properly </strong>(most bulb retailers and municipal dumps will take them). In the rare case of a bulb breaking in the home, open the window for a while and, as a precaution, wear rubber gloves when sweeping up the fragments.</p> <p><strong>14. Another frequently heard whinge is that low-energy bulbs can't use dimmer switches. </strong>This isn't true, as there are already various brands of green bulbs compatible with dimmers. Again, they cost more than regular bulbs, but if you factor in energy consumption, each bulb you purchase will represent a massive saving.</p> <p><strong>15. Switching to low-energy bulbs is a no-brainer. </strong>But what about the argument that anything we do to be green in the UK will be offset by the growth of China? In fact, not only are emissions per person in China still much lower than in the UK, the Chinese government is also promoting energy saving. In April this year it unveiled a massive subsidy scheme to encourage the use of low-energy lightbulbs. The Chinese also produce most of the world's low-energy bulbs. The least we can do is use them...</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Duncan Clark is consultant to the Guardian's environment team.

  "<p>In this likeably acid take on the global business of \"branding\", financial reporter Conley travels to the industry's world capital, Cincinnati, Ohio, to listen in ironic puzzlement to the experts, and tells great anecdotes about the silly money spent on branding toilet papers, entire cities, and, increasingly, yourself. He has a serious message for commerce, too: companies are tempted to rebrand rather than developing better products, because the former is easier. And yet, Conley argues, branding doesn't really work (Coke and Pepsi spend millions on new products that flop): he argues, indeed, that when \"inundated by junk, consumers simply stop listening\". Perhaps there is a small tension between this and the book's other, more apocalyptic sociological message: that the prevalence of branding is in danger of \"perverting our definition of community\", and making us abandon reason. It would be frightening if it were plausible.</p>",
  "<p>Global warming, global terrorism, food crises, water crises, oil conflicts, culture wars - \"civilisation\" seems to be accelerating towards self-destruction. These are circumstances in which art and artists tend to get political or, alternatively, resign themselves to insignificance. In literature, the phenomenon is exacerbated by the difficulty many people have reading for anything beyond content and immediately communicated emotion. As Borges once remarked, since most critics have little sense of the aesthetic, they have to find other criteria for judging a book - political persuasion being the most obvious.</p> <p>At such a moment, it may be worth looking at the work of a man who had a rather unusual take on the relationship between art and politics, who saw the two as intimately related and mutually conditioning, art being allowed a certain, perhaps even pervasive, influence, but not in the crass sense of grinding an axe, or even exploring controversial situations; on the contrary, art might be most \"useful\" when, to all intents and purposes, most \"irrelevant\".</p> <p>Gregory Bateson (1904-80) was born into a family with a history of spirited scientific controversy. His father William, a distinguished naturalist, was responsible for coining the word \"genetics\" and had been both translator and vociferous champion of Mendel's pioneer work on hybrids and heredity. Gregory was named after the Austrian monk, no doubt with the hope that he would follow in his footsteps.</p> <p>It wasn't to be. Explaining to his disappointed father that he was giving up zoology for the relatively new subject of anthropology, the young Bateson spoke of his need for \"a break with ordinary impersonal science\". He had grown up in a house where William Blake's paintings hung on the walls, where art and poetry were revered as the acme of human achievement yet at the same time considered, as his father put it, \"scarcely within the reach of people like ourselves\". Gregory's elder brother, Martin, who aspired to become a poet rather than a scientist, argued bitterly with his father and eventually killed himself in a scenario that might have been invented to demonstrate the limitations of \"impersonal science\". Infatuated with a girl who never gave him the slightest hope, he shot himself by the statue of Eros in Piccadilly Circus, a suicide note and a poem in his pocket.</p> <p>After his brother's suicide, an artist's life must have seemed impossible to Gregory. On the other hand, and rather paradoxically, art was the achievement to which his dogmatic, scientific family attached the greatest value. Bateson's choice of anthropology can be seen as a way of combining the scientific and artistic. In the opening page of his first book, Naven, a study of the Iatmul people of New Guinea, he reflected on the advantages of a novelist's eye when it came to describing a foreign culture: \"The artist . . . can leave a great many of the most fundamental aspects of culture to be picked up not from his actual words, but from his emphasis.\" He can \"group and stress\" words \"so that the reader almost unconsciously receives information which is not explicit in the sentences and which the artist would find it hard - almost impossible - to express in analytic terms. This impressionistic technique is utterly foreign to the methods of science.\"</p> <p>At once it was clear that Bateson's instinct was to grasp, as an artist might, a sense of the wholeness of a culture, rather than to report particular facts. It's not surprising that his second project, in Bali, undertaken with his wife, Margaret Mead, was the first to make systematic use of photographs in an ethnographic study. Ever resistant to the analytic and reductive, Bateson stressed that the photographs should always be seen in relation to each other: </p> <p>In this monograph we are attempting a new method of stating the intangible relationships among different types of culturally standardised behaviour by placing side by side mutually relevant photographs. Pieces of behaviour, spatially and contextually separated - a trance dancer being carried in a procession, a man looking up at an airplane, a servant greeting his master in a play, the painting of a dream - may all be relevant to a single discussion; the same emotional thread may run through them. </p> <p>Over his lifetime, Bateson was involved in a wide range of studies, the early anthropological explorations being followed by work on families and mental health problems (when he invented the idea of \"the double bind\"), studies in cybernetics and communication, and even in the \"language\" of dolphins and other creatures. What seems to have fascinated Bateson was the question: how does a complex culture maintain a relatively steady state, adapting to outside change and correcting internal imbalances? Perhaps, having been brought up in a family always engaged in public polemics and torn apart by the conflict that led to his brother's suicide (another older brother was killed in the first world war), Bateson was looking for the sort of mechanisms that can prevent tension from blowing up into tragedy; hence the rather surprising way he would often mix his anthropology with diagrams of such things as thermostatic cut-out systems, or steam engine governors. In any event, it was his eye for the way negative situations are, or are not, defused before the worst can happen that led to his formulating some interesting reflections on art.</p> <p>In New Guinea, Bateson had been observing the different behaviour patterns of men and women among the local people. The more the men were exhibitionist and boastful, the more the women became quiet and contemplative. It was clear that this reciprocal process was potentially dangerous: competing with each other to show off, the men became extremely aggressive, while it sometimes seemed that the women risked sinking into catatonia. </p> <p>Bateson called his book Naven after the series of bizarre rituals that he came to see as \"correcting\" this behavioural process and guaranteeing stability. In these complex ceremonies men dressed up as women and vice versa. The women assumed the traditional behaviour of the men while the men were abject and passive, even submitting to simulated rape. Crucially, Bateson observed, no one was conscious of what the social function of the ceremonies might be. For the participants, the rituals had religious significance and that was that. Where competing behaviour patterns could push people to extremes, Bateson concluded - and he mentioned such things as the arms race and sadomasochism - corrective influences would very probably be doing their work unacknowledged. It might in fact be important that people remained unaware of what was happening. </p> <p>Turning to modern western societies, the key difference Bateson noted was the prodigious empowerment of the conscious, purposeful mind at the expense of less conscious practices and traditions. Much of his work (excellently anthologised in Steps to an Ecology of Mind) now focused on problems of epistemology: what knowledge we have, how we get it and how it is organised. While man was a complex mesh of mind and matter, and human society a dense labyrinth of interlocking systems, human consciousness, Bateson speculated, contained only very limited information about the whole. Since technology had hugely increased the power of conscious purpose to intervene in the world and alter the environment, the danger was that each \"improvement\" of our situation - a vaccine, an insecticide, a dam - would in fact upset a delicate balance. Back in the 60s, Bateson was among the first to appreciate the dangers of man-made climate change.</p> <p>Where does art come into this? The curious nature of Bateson's \"epistemological\" approach was that it prevented him from proposing remedies to the problems he identified. His thinking contained a kind of catch-22: the conscious mind, his own included, was of its nature incapable of grasping the vast system of which it was only a very small and far from representative part; hence any major intervention to \"solve\" a given problem would always be ill-informed and inadvisable. The only possible solution would be a radical change in our way of thinking, or even our way of knowing, a new (or ancient) mindset in which conscious purpose would be viewed as only a minor and rather suspect part of mental life.</p> <p>Dreams, religious experience, art, love - these were the phenomena that still had power, Bateson thought, to undermine the rash/rational purposeful mind. Of these four, art enjoyed the special role of fusing different \"levels of mind\" together: there was necessarily consciousness and purpose in the decision to create, but creativity itself involved openness to material from the unconscious, otherwise the work would be merely schematic and transparent.</p> <p>Discussing a Balinese painting that at the most immediate level shows a cremation procession, but can also be read as a phallic symbol (the tall cremation tower in the centre has an elephant on each side at the base) or as an account of Balinese social organisation (the etiquette and gaiety of the funeral crowd smoothing the turbulence of grief), Bateson remarks that the painting is profound because not \"really\" about one or the other, or even all three, but about their connectedness. \"In a word, it is only about relationship and not about any identifiable relata.\" </p> <p>Similarly, a novel whose characters develop in a mutually defining play of identities, each changing in response to the others, expressing together a collective ethos of which none is fully representative - one thinks of the Karamazov brothers and their appalling father - undermines the notion that anyone can grasp the overall pattern of which they are a part. So, quite apart from any political content, narrative can induce a contemplative respect for the mysterious interconnectedness of the world, something that, hopefully, might lead to more cautious behaviour and a little less enthusiasm for dramatic intervention. It was a defining moment in Bateson's own career when, having elaborated a series of ideas about mental illness that led to the development of modern family therapy, he withdrew from the field, shocked by the hands-on interventionist approach that his research colleagues had begun to employ.</p> <p>Did Bateson really imagine that humanity might be enchanted into a less destructive, more meditative mode by reading stories and looking at pictures, or better still listening to music, which was pure complex interrelation without any suspicious content? </p> <p>Probably not. Perhaps, true to his own reasoning, he wasn't trying to \"be practical\", but to offer an attractive idea we might enjoy reflecting on. One of the characteristic aspects of his work is his attempt to draw science into the realm of aesthetics. Having likened the prospect of benign government intervention in social behaviour to the task of reversing an articulated lorry through a labyrinth, he concludes: \"We social scientists would do well to hold back our eagerness to control that world which we so imperfectly understand. The fact of our imperfect understanding should not be allowed to feed our anxiety and so increase the need to control. Rather our studies could be inspired by a more ancient, but today less honoured, motive: a curiosity about the world of which we are part. The rewards of such work are not power but beauty.\"</p> <p>Rebelling to the end against his father's tendency to place artistic genius on a pedestal and beyond the reach of ordinary minds, Bateson invites us all, whatever we may be up to, to put beauty before \"practicality\". His achievement was to offer convincing scientific arguments for our doing so.</p>",

  "<p>It was billed as a victory rally and held in Old Billingsgate on the edge of the Thames, the very heart of historical London. </p> <p>Flyers dropped through the letter boxes of thousands of homes, inviting people to \"celebrate a turning point in medical history\". </p> <p>Spotlighted on the podium against a darkened Grand Hall on the night of March 24 last year was a charismatic figure with prematurely white hair and such impassioned oratorical skills that the several hundred in the audience seemed enthralled as he denounced modern medicine, accused the pharmaceutical industry of murderous intent and hailed vitamins and minerals as the cure for all diseases. </p> <p>This was Matthias Rath, the vitamin promoter who has been accused of endangering the lives of Aids sufferers in South Africa and who was now embarking on a further chapter of his business plan.</p> <p>Rath, who says he was born in Germany although documents he filed at Companies House say he is Dutch, obtained his basic medical degree in 1985, after studying in Munster and Hamburg. </p> <p>The 53-year-old became a researcher first at the University Clinic in Hamburg and then, during 1989 and 1990, at the Berlin Heart Centre.</p> <p>After this, however, Rath followed a path which led him to repudiate modern medicine and set himself up as the guru of a movement which claimed it could cure all the world's diseases with simple concoctions of micronutrients - vitamin and mineral pills which he sells across the world through his websites.</p> <p>Rath left Germany to work at the Linus Pauling Institute in California. Pauling, the then 89-year-old double Nobel Prize winner - for chemistry in 1954 and peace in 1962 (for campaigning against above-ground nuclear testing) - was convinced that vitamins and minerals could cure diseases. Towards the end of his life (he died in 1994), he attempted to prove that high dose vitamin C could kill cancer.</p> <p>Among Rath's claims on his website and in all his publicity materials is his assertion that Pauling chose him as his successor. </p> <p>Those at the institute in the 1990s say Pauling may have thought of him as a leader in the context of micronutrients, but no more than that - and that the Nobel laureate always said it was not for him but for the institute to decide his successor. </p> <p>Not long after Pauling's death, in what was to become a long chapter of legal actions against his critics around the world, Rath sued the institute for interfering with his business relationships. </p> <p>He lost and the institute counter-sued for libel and interfering in their business relationships. The case was settled out of court in 1994 and all agreements between Pauling and Rath were nullified. Rath was assigned some patents and ordered to pay the institute $75,000 (about \u00a343,000).</p> <p>By now, he had his own self-styled foundation, which he claims is non-profit-making and seeks donations for research, although it is thought to make millions from sales of his products. </p> <p>His basic health formula, called Vitacor Plus in the UK and dispatched from a trading estate in Slough, was selling last year to those who attended the Billingsgate rally at \u00a326.50 for 90 pills.</p> <p>He set up in the UK early on, as Matthias Rath Ltd, with a registered address in Guildford, Surrey, in July 1998.</p> <p>The business was categorised as \"manufacture of other food products\".

This time it was against a claim published in Britain by a California-based organisation called the \"Health4Us Foundation\" - which appears to provide publicity for the Rath Foundation - that Rath's \"remarkable natural approach is capable of controlling the spread of cancerous cells in the human body without damaging healthy cells\".</p> <p>Other rulings have followed. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US in the same year ordered Rath to take his unproven therapeutic claims for Vitacor Plus and Diacor off his website. </p> <p>In 2003, the regional court in Berlin banned Rath from calling himself in his adverts \"the renowned doctor\" and/or \"the renowned scientist\", after a court case in which medical and scientific witnesses said he was neither.</p> <p>In the same year, Rath's theories and micronutrients were disavowed by the respected and influential Swiss Study Group for Complementary and Alternative Methods in Cancer.</p> <p>\"After examining the literature and other available information,\" it said, the group \"have found no proof that the vitamin preparations of Dr Matthias Rath have any effect on human cancer. </p> <p>\"They advise against their use in cancer prevention and treatment while recommending a diet rich in fruit and vegetables.\"</p> <p>The distressing case of a young boy with cancer was making headlines in Germany in 2003. </p> <p>Dominik Feld, nine, had bone cancer, but his parents would not accept the doctors' decision that his leg had to be amputated to save his life.

  "<p>While John McCain campaigns far away from Washington, his Senate colleagues are quietly crafting an energy deal that could give his rival Barack Obama a boost of momentum in the election's final days.</p> <p>The energy pact was first sealed by 10 senators, all of them concerned that the bitter political stalemate over offshore oil drilling had drowned out any dialog over diversifying American energy sources. </p> <p>The senators drew up a plan that included concessions for both right and left: Republicans got new coastal oil drilling in four eastern states and the Gulf of Mexico, while Democrats got to keep the ban on drilling in Alaska's Arctic wildlife refuge and more green energy incentives.</p> <p>\"We've tried to address all of the above\" when it comes to increasing energy availability, Republican senator Saxby Chambliss, an original backer of the deal, said today. \"Obviously, you're going to get a lot of criticism when you do that.\"</p> <p>At first the deal got plenty of criticism, from environmentalists and pro-business conservatives alike, and little traction on Capitol Hill. </p> <p>But as high gas prices pushed economic anxiety to the forefront of the campaign season, more and more senators signed on. Obama offered his cautious endorsement last month.</p> <p>The \"gang of 10\", as the dealmakers called themselves, became 16, and today a \"gang of 20\" \u2013 with one senator jokingly offering a gang sign of three fingers in the air, to form an E for energy. </p> <p>The plan's biggest opponent remains McCain, whose camp disapproves of its tax increases on oil companies to offset its $84bn price tag. No less a conservative elder than Rush Limbaugh warned McCain's fellow Republicans not to back the deal out of \"stupidity\" and \"selfishness\".</p> <p>But even Joseph Lieberman, the former Democrat who is one of McCain's closest allies, is warming to the energy plan. \"I think we've got a fighting chance of getting something done here,\" he told the Hartford Courant newspaper yesterday.</p> <p>Perhaps recognising the benefit of increasing pressure on McCain, Democratic leaders are now likely to hold a vote on the plan next week. \"No one expects the product of their work to be perfect,\" Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said today. \"Compromise never is.\" </p> <p>At a congressional energy summit on Capitol Hill today, the energy deal's supporters got advice from clean-tech and energy experts on both sides of the ideological spectrum.</p> <p>Dan Reicher, the director of energy at Google and a member of the group Clean Tech for Obama, told the senators that no option to increase energy supplies \u2013 even oil drilling \u2013 should be refused. </p> <p>\"We do need to do everything,\" he said, adding a meaningful caveat: \"If I had to weight this, I'd say there's a big opportunity to first cut demand, so it's traditional or alternative supplies that we meet that demand with.\"</p> <p>Members of the \"gang of 20\" used the energy summit to tout their plan, displaying confidence in its ability to win Senate approval before this year's session ends in two weeks.</p> <p>The prospect of isolating McCain from fellow Republicans who support the deal, with Obama lending his support for the compromise, could entice even more Democrats to come on board.</p> <p>Even if the pact can pass, however, it would still have a long way to go before becoming law. Approval would still be required in the House of Representatives, where liberals and conservatives have a stronger pull on their respective parties and could unite to bring down the plan.</p>",
  "<p>There is a \"magical logic\" in the way hundreds of billions of pounds' worth of carbon allowances are given away to polluting companies, an employee of an major UK carmaker told the Guardian. That company, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/12/emissionstrading\">as David Adam reveals</a>, was given twice as many allowances \u2013 tradable pollution permits created by the EU's Emission Trading System (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Emission_Trading_Scheme\">EUETS</a>) \u2013 as it actually needs to cover its own emissions. The remainder it will sell in the UK's dynamic carbon market, receiving a multimillion-pound windfall profit. <br> This is strange. Under the \"polluter pays\" principle, a longstanding cornerstone of the UK's environmental policy, polluters are meant to pay for the cost of their pollution \u2013 that is, for the damage that their pollution causes to others (for example, in harming health or damaging property). For carbon dioxide, the main pollutant responsible for global warming, Nicholas Stern argued in <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm\">his famous Review</a> that every tonne of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere imposes damage worth $25 to $85 per tonne on society as a whole. It follows that this cost should be paid by the companies responsible.<br> But in the looking-glass world of the EUETS, the \"polluters pays\" principle is replaced by its mirror image \u2013 the \"polluters get paid\" principle. This is very magical indeed for the companies that benefit, and for their shareholders. As for the logic ... well, who needs logic when there is money to fill your boots with, and serious money at that? As we struggle to stay afloat amid rising fuel and food costs, the falling pound and a collapsing property market, there is at least one thing we can be glad of: the carbon market is booming. Between 2006 and 2007, the market for EUETS allowances grew 104%, <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/NEWS/Resources/State&amp;Trendsformatted06May10pm.pdf\">turning over an astonishing $50bn (pdf)</a>.<br> Carbon fortunes are indeed being made, and many of them in the City of London, which dominates the global carbon marketplace. But the biggest winners of all are the biggest polluters, the power companies, which benefit to the tune of \u20ac30bn per year. According to energy regulator Ofgem, the UK's power companies will receive a \u00a39bn windfall profit from their free allowances between 2008 and 2012. And now a broader range of industrial companies are cashing in on the carbon bonanza. The problem arises from the very structure of the EUETS. When it was set up in 2005, each country was given its own allocation of allowances, and they passed on the allowances to the biggest industrial polluters based on their historic greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 the more they had been polluting, the more allowances they were given \u2013 in a process known as \"grandfathering\". And companies are still being given allowances based on those same historic levels of pollution, even if they have reduced their emissions since then. There is one sense in which this is fair enough: companies that have become more efficient deserve their reward. After all, this is why they invested in efficiency in the first place. But this is not quite as fair as it looks. It means that companies that had already raised their energy efficiency <em>before</em> the EUETS came into being are being penalised. Those that deliberately bloated their carbon emissions, which they can now bring down easily at little cost, are getting the biggest reward. Moreover, the system effectively bars new players in any industry that would have to buy all their allowances \u2013 creating unshakeable established monopolies.<br> More fundamentally, we must recognise that the EUETS allowances are a form of money \u2013 tradable instruments like, for example, government bonds issued by the Treasury. We would not be very impressed by a chancellor who gave away billions of pounds' worth of government bonds to banks. We should be equally unimpressed with the EUETS as it gives away 2bn carbon allowances a year, worth \u2013 at today's price of \u20ac23.35 \u2013 \u20ac47bn.  There is an alternative. At the inception of the EUETS, every economist in town was imploring the EU to sell the carbon allowances by auction, up to the emissions cap, to avoid all the entirely predictable consequences of grandfathering. This way, the polluters would be competing to buy their allowances, and their would come back to the public purse where it could be used either to reduce the level of taxation generally, or to finance projects to reduce emissions - investing in energy conservation, for example, or renewable energy. But under pressure from industry lobbyists, the EU caved in. Amazingly, the EU's rules even prohibited individual countries from auctioning their allowances, just in case they wanted to. Since then, there have been reforms. Under Phase 2 of the EUETS, which runs from 2008 to 2012, countries are allowed to auction their allowances, up to a limit of 10%. The percentage will go up in Phase 3 (2013 to 2020) to 60%, but we will probably have to wait until 2021 for 100% auctioning \u2013 if we're lucky. And by then, the public purse will have been sold out to the tune of \u20ac500bn or more. Say what you might about Brussels lobbyists, they are worth their weight in gold \u2013 at least, to the companies who pay them. In this particular case, about 1bn <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_weight\">troy ounces</a>, or 30,000 tonnes of the stuff. Now, there's magical logic for you. Midas, eat your heart out!</p>",

Towards the end of his life (he died in 1994) he attempted to prove that high dose vitamin C could kill cancer.</p> <p>Among the claims on Rath's website and in all his publicity materials is his assertion that Pauling chose him as his successor. </p> <p>Those at the institute in the 90s say Pauling may have thought of Rath as a leader in the context of micronutrients, but no more than that.</p> <p>They also say the Nobel Laureate always said it was not for him, but for the institute, to decide his successor. </p> <p>Not long after Pauling's death, in what was to become a long chapter of legal actions against his critics around the world, Rath sued the institute for interfering with his business relationships. </p> <p>He lost, and the institute counter-sued for libel and interfering in its business relationships. The case was settled out of court in 1994, and all agreements between Pauling and Rath were nullified. Rath was assigned some patents and ordered to pay the institute $75,000.</p> <p>By now, he had his own self-styled foundation, which he claimed to be non profit-making and seeking donations for research, although it is thought to make millions from sales of his products. </p> <p>His basic health formula, called Vitacor Plus in the UK and dispatched from a trading estate in Slough, was selling last year to those who attended the Billingsgate rally at \u00a326.50 for 90 pills.</p> <p>He set up in the UK early on, as Matthias Rath Ltd, with a registered address in Guildford, Surrey, in July 1998.</p> <p>The business was categorised as \"manufacture of other food products\".

  "<p>A flagship European scheme designed to fight global warming is set to hand hundreds of millions of pounds to some of Britain's most polluting companies, with little or no benefit to the environment, an investigation by the Guardian has revealed.</p> <p>Dozens of multinational firms stand to benefit from the windfall, which comes from the over-allocation of carbon permits under the European emissions trading scheme. </p> <p>The permits are given to companies by the government, and are supposed to account for their carbon pollution over the next five years. But figures published by the European Commission show that many companies have been allocated far too many permits, which they can sell for cash.</p> <p>The scheme is supposed to only distribute as many permits as companies require, with one permit allocated for each tonne of CO2 produced. </p> <p>The figures, compiled by the Guardian and the campaign group Sandbag, suggest that up to 9m extra annual permits have been allocated to 200 companies across almost all sectors of the British economy, from steel and cement making, to car manufacturing and the food and drink industry. Dozens of household names such as Ford, Thames Water, Astra Zeneca and Vauxhall are among the companies that could benefit. </p> <p>One of the largest over-allocation of permits is to Castle Cement, which makes a quarter of all British cement at three works in Lancashire, north Wales and Rutland. The figures show carbon dioxide emissions from the three plants have fallen from 2.3m tonnes in 2005 to 2.1m tonnes in 2007. Yet, under the ETS, the firm has been handed enough permits to produce 2.9m tonnes CO2 for each of the next five years - an annual surplus of 829,000 permits. </p> <p>A spokesman for Castle Cement said: \"Castle Cement will not require all its allocated permits to cover CO2 emissions in 2008 as we continue to reduce our impact on the environment in line with our sustainability strategy. </p> <p>\"Total CO2 emissions from our three works are likely to be less than in 2007 due to further improvements in efficiency, increased use of low-carbon fuels and a weakening demand for cement caused by the general economic downturn. Surplus credits will be traded.\" </p> <p>At the current price of \u00a321, the company could sell its surplus permits for \u00a383.5m over the five years.</p> <p>Ford said it expected an annual surplus of almost 80,000 permits, which it would consider selling. Astra Zeneca said it would sell permits from its expected annual surplus of 37,000, but that the resulting money would be used to improve environmental performance. Thames Water, Heathrow Airport and Toyota were among companies who said they had not decided what to do with surplus credits.</p> <p>Each company's surplus was calculated using figures published by the European Commission on corporate CO2 emissions for 2007, and annual permit allocations for 2008-12, under the ETS second phase. </p> <p>The over-allocation comes from the way the government calculated the likely emissions of each site owned by the companies in the scheme. Each site's permit allocation was based on average emissions from 2000-2003, but also took into account projected growth and improvements in energy efficiency. </p> <p>Campaigners say the allocations were also influenced by industry group lobbying. A source at a major UK car manufacturing firm, which has been allocated more than double the number of permits it needs, told the Guardian they were given out based on \"magical logic\". </p> <p>Karsten Neuhoff, an expert in emissions trading at Cambridge University, said the over-allocation to so many companies was \"an indication of the bargaining power of industry\". </p> <p>He said: \"We may agree as a society that we need to cut emissions, but when it comes down to individual companies and then individual installations and individual behaviours, we say 'oh no, we can't cut them here'. Everyone is a special case.\" </p> <p>Not all apparent surpluses are over-allocation of permits. Some companies, including those in the cement and offshore industries, have been given extra permits to account for changes in the way their emissions are measured. Steel maker Corus, which has the largest apparent annual surplus of 2.8m, says the extra credits for 2008 must cover 10% more of its operations than were counted in 2007. </p> <p>A few companies have been allocated fewer permits than they require. The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, with an apparent annual deficit of 5,800 said it would need to buy permits this year. </p> <p>The only sector to be given fewer permits than it needs is the electricity supply industry, which is more than 70m short. The government says this is because they are not subject to international competition, and they can pass on the cost of buying permits to customers. The under allocation to the UK electricity sector means emissions overall will reduce by some 60m tonnes a year. </p> <p>Bryony Worthington, founder of <a href=\"http://sandbag.org.uk\">Sandbag</a>, said: \"The way this is set up the environment takes all the risk and business doesn't take any. Hundreds of companies have been given a free ride while those that do have to buy permits can simply pass on the costs. </p> <p>\"That means electricity customers are effectively subsidising heavy industry's right to pollute, while being urged to make environmental sacrifices in their own lives.\"</p> <p>Sandbag will launch a campaign this week to pressure companies to surrender surplus credits. It aims to take a million permits out of circulation, which it hopes will raise the price and make companies more likely to invest in clean technology.</p> <p>The environment department Defra said it would not discuss allocations for individual companies. A spokesperson said: \"It is of course impossible to predict what any company or installation's exact emissions for the next five years by looking at their emissions in 2007. </p> <p>\"Decisions on allocations were made on a sound historical basis. It is natural that economic, sectoral, production and technical factors will see emissions at individual installations differ from the predictions. </p> <p>\"What matters is that regardless of individual fluctuations, all emissions in the scheme are constrained by the overall cap, if one installation increases its emissions, the same amount of emissions have to be cut elsewhere.\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Additional reporting by Alexandra Topping</p>",
  "<p><strong>What is the European emissions trading scheme (ETS)?</strong><br>The world's first large-scale carbon trading market, set up in 2005 under the Kyoto protocol as a way to use the market to reduce industry pollution.</p> <p><strong>How is it supposed to work?</strong><br>Hundreds of polluting companies, including power generators, oil producers and car-makers, have their direct emissions from fuel use capped by the European commission. Companies that produce more pollution than allowed must buy permits from cleaner rivals. In time, the cap is reduced and the price of carbon permits rises to the point where firms would rather invest in reducing their emissions.</p> <p><strong>Does it work?</strong><br>Not yet. The first phase of the scheme, from 2005 to 2007, is widely viewed as a disaster. European governments gave out too many permits to their companies, which then put them up for sale. The result? The price crashed to \u20ac0.1 in September 2007. There was also criticism of the windfall received by electricity generators. These were the only companies to be given fewer permits than they required, but were allowed to pass on the cost to their customers.</p> <p><strong>What do the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/12/emissionstrading\">new figures revealed by the Guardian</a> show?</strong><br>They refer to phase two of the scheme, which begins this year but is overdue. They show that as many as 200 UK companies (outside the electricity supply sector) have received too many permits again.</p> <p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><br>Because the UK permits are given out for free, but have an asset value, the companies with too many have effectively been handed a subsidy. The over-allocation could also send out the wrong message. About half the EU carbon dioxide emissions are captured in the ETS, but governments have so far been reluctant to tighten the cap to squeeze the firms to reduce emissions. Most in the UK have effectively been given official permission not to reduce pollution for the next five years.</p> <p><strong>What next?</strong><br>Companies can bank spare permits for use in the third phase after 2012, when their value is expected to rise, so the price should not crash again. How permits are allocated in phase three, currently being decided in Brussels, could make or break the success of the scheme. Campaigners want Brussels to auction the permits. Industry lobbyists are trying to maintain the current free-for-all.</p>",
  "<p>If you ever try to discuss carbon emissions trading you are soon left feeling as if you're wading through a giant bowl of Alphabeti Spaghetti. The subject drips with acronyms: CDM, ROCs, EU ETS, CRC, EUAs, CERs. Rumour has it that some ministers have been known to carry cribsheets into high-level discussions to protect themselves against this blizzard of jargon - and who can blame them? </p> <p>It can be such a, let's be frank, dull and impenetrable subject that there are those who believe the obfuscation is intentional, to repel prying eyes from exposing the murky workings of the only truly international system up and running that's designed, by curbing greenhouse gas emissions via the \"cap and trade\" principle, to protect us against runaway climate change.</p> <p>Bryony Worthington, who has inhaled the fug of emissions trading every day for the past decade, first as an environmental campaigner, then as a government official, and finally as a lobbyist for a giant energy firm, has had enough.</p> <p>Using her unique knowledge of how \"this game\" works, she wants to expose its underbelly and help to spark greater debate about what, she believes, is a vitally important component of our collective fight against climate change.</p> <p>\"Sunlight is the best disinfectant,\" she says, sitting inside her temporary new 'office', a corner in her local pub in north London. \"If you open all this process up to the public and show them what's happening, then you stand a much better chance of cleaning this up.\"</p> <p><strong>Permits to pollute</strong></p> <p>Next week, Worthington launches <a href=\"http://sandbag.org.uk\"> Sandbag.org.uk</a>, a not-for-profit website that allows members to buy up surplus \"permits to pollute\" that form the currency of the European Union's emissions trading scheme (or EU ETSs). Members can then \"retire\" them so that they cannot continue to be traded between the industrial polluters - cement, steel and car manufacturers etc - forced by EU regulation to operate within the system. \"I suppose it's a bit like burning money in front of someone so they can't spend it on something bad,\" she explains.</p> <p>The concept sounds like a clever variation of carbon offsetting, the now mocked method of allowing people to atone for their \"carbon sins\" - flying, driving, heating - by letting them pay for, say, a tree to be planted, or someone else, often in a developing country, to reduce emissions on their behalf. </p> <p>Worthington is sensitive to the charge. \"We've deliberately tried not to look like an offsetting website,\" she says, adding that some offsetting firms can, in her view, be \"more evil than doing nothing\" due to the often neo-imperialistic veneer of some of the offsetting projects they fund in the developing world.</p> <p>\"There's no carbon calculator on our site, for example. My pitch is simply that if you haven't got a lot of time, but do have a credit card, you can take, say, a tonne of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere in a second by paying for an emissions credit to be withdrawn from the system.\" At the current rate of trading in the EU ETS, a tonne of carbon is priced at about \u20ac23 (\u00a318), around twice the average price to offset a tonne of CO2 as charged by an offsetting company.</p> <p>\"I really want to distance Sandbag from the term 'offsetting'. Most schemes today are simply saying to someone in a country such as India, 'You can't use a diesel pump for your water hole. Use this hand pump instead because we're trying to get carbon emissions down'. So these people end up using a more labour-intensive device so that we can drive down to Sainsbury's to pick up some Evian? That's just wrong.\"</p> <p>She sees Sandbag's role as offering a platform to help people subvert, agitate and campaign against the imperfections and injustices embedded in the current emissions trading scheme. She would far prefer to use the collective voice of future Sandbag members to coax the big industrial polluters into handing over their surplus credits than have to rely on members to buy them. But, I put to her, surely this is an idealistic dream? Why on earth would these firms with surplus credits - which Worthington estimates to be about two-thirds of the 300-odd firms currently operating within the EU ETS - wish to give up the chance to earn millions by selling them?</p> <p>\"We need to explain to these companies that they need a carbon market that works,\" she says, stressing that the current surplus threatens to kill the market dead, because the price remains far too low to encourage firms to implement meaningful reductions. </p> <p>\"What we have to tell them is that if the current system is allowed to fall over then the alternative will be a world of heavy regulation and high taxes. The allocation was calculated on nothing more than guesswork. </p> <p>\"They know the current surplus is a windfall. We know it's a windfall. Just give it back. We need to shame them into it by getting some forward-thinking firms to make the leap first.\"</p> <p><strong>Mould-breaker</strong></p> <p>It can be tempting to view Worthington as just another principled environmental campaigner: well intentioned, but hopelessly na\u00efve to the motivations of those who sit in boardrooms. But her CV reveals plenty of experience of operating within the world of pin stripes and double strength lattes.</p> <p>Worthington grew up on a farm in Wales. \"I can remember doing talks at school about saving the whale. I wasn't a hippy, but I had a sentimental view of the environment.\" </p> <p>After studying English literature, she travelled before joining Operation Raleigh as a fundraiser. It was in the mid-1990s, working for a conservation charity, that climate change pricked her consciousness. By 2000 she had moved to Friends of the Earth as a climate-change campaigner. But it was never a natural home for her.</p> <p>\"I didn't fit the mould at FoE. I was keen to talk to civil servants and talk about the detail of the policy. I've always been pragmatic. FoE is a great brand and has a brilliant media team, but I suppose it has quite a limiting perspective. </p> <p>\"Since going into government and the private sector I've noticed things aren't as black and white as you'd like them to be in the NGO world.\"</p> <p>A spell at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs implementing public awareness campaigns and helping draft the Climate Change Bill, was followed by another career swerve. She became a lobbyist, \"head of government relations\", for Scottish and Southern Energy, one of the UK's largest energy companies. </p> <p>For some former colleagues, this role reversal must have seemed as if she had not only danced with the devil but gone back to his place for the proverbial coffee. But her experience has given her a rare insight into the workings of three very different, yet interlocking, worlds.</p> <p>\"Working for the government can be amazing if you can get things going, but there's just so much inertia in the system,\" she says. By comparison, the private sector was \"great\". \"People are motivated. Meetings are barely tolerated, whereas at NGOs everyone loves two to three-hour meetings. Government is even worse. In the private sector, I found a refreshing lack of politics.\"</p> <p>But didn't she find it uncomfortable working for, as her campaigner friends might see it, the \"enemy\"? </p> <p>\"When I first walked in, they had pinned my old 'carbon dinosaur' campaigning leaflets to the computer screen to remind me that they knew where I had come from. But I wouldn't have gone there if I didn't think they were a forward-thinking company. </p> <p>\"I did think briefly, 'What have I done?' But in the time I was there, they invested massively in renewables and are one of the few energy companies working to help customers reduce their energy demand. They still do need to sort out what they are doing with coal, though. But then, no one really knows what to do yet.\"</p> <p><strong>Carrot and stick</strong></p> <p>Worthington says her time at Scottish and Southern Energy taught her that a market-based emissions reduction mechanism, such as the EU ETS, is the only option if we are ever to convince polluters to change. She welcomes the announcement by Gordon Brown on Thursday that the energy firms must help pay for homes to be better insulated, but says there are more important things the government could be concentrating on, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology - the great, unproven hope for cleaning up coal.</p> <p>\"The government can't expect an incumbent industry to innovate towards CCS. Why would they change direction if they are making lots of money now? They need both a carrot and stick. The [emissions trading system], despite its problems, gives companies both. You need a market. </p> <p>\"You need to get capitalists interested - that's when you get big cash flow. Most people think we need credits to be worth \u20ac75 a tonne to get CCS off the ground. That's why we must fight to reduce the surplus.\"</p> <p>But, she says, governments tend to be weak when facing the collective might of industry lobbyists. She hopes Sandbag will help individuals counter that. </p> <p>\"Having been a lobbyist myself you can't overstate how easy it is to get things done your way. In Brussels there is a key vote next month in which the Environment Council will begin deciding what it thinks the ETS allocations should be beyond 2013. </p> <p>\"Every industrial lobbyist worth their salt has been there all summer. By comparison, there are probably just five or so representatives from the NGOs. It's a complicated policy and many lobbyists are trying to wreck amendments as we speak. </p> <p>\"An NGO can't expect to win against this without some kind of major civil movement behind them. We have to target the educated, informed and affluent to do something. It's our responsibility, the ones who have all these privileges. That's what I'm trying to do with Sandbag.\"</p>",
  "<p>The good times rolled last year for top executives in American boardrooms, pocketing solid pay rises in spite of the credit crunch, the sub-prime mortgage crisis and early signs of an economic slump.</p> <p>A veteran Silicon Valley technology entrepreneur topped the remuneration table. Larry Ellison, founder and chief executive of the business software company Oracle, took home $84.6m (\u00a348m).</p> <p>The billionaire America's Cup sailing fanatic fought off stiff competition to take the top-paid title. According to analysis by Associated Press, the 10 highest earners in the US included the bosses of three investment banks \u2014 Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley \u2014 and three energy and mining firms buoyed up by soaring commodity prices.</p> <p>Straitened economic conditions in the US only modestly dented the annual boardroom bonanza. A survey by Hay Group for the Wall Street Journal found compensation rose 3.5% to an average of $8.85m among chief executives of 200 top US corporations. There were few examples, however, of standout pay packages. Nobody made it into nine figures last year unlike, for example, Home Depot's Robert Nardelli who secured a $210m severance package in 2006, or Richard Fairbank of credit card firm Capital One, who scooped $280m in 2005.</p> <p>\"I don't think we've seen any particularly significant cases in the last 12 months,\" said Ryan Johnson of employment consultants WorldatWork. The reason was straightforward \u2014 the stock market had a tough year which meant executive share options fared poorly.</p> <p>\"Most of the major indices were down 10% or 15% which meant you didn't have as much cashing in as usual,\" said Johnson. \"The amount of equity most US executives now have ties their personal compensation to the share price.\"</p> <p>The pay league runner-up was Merrill Lynch's John Thain who got a generous signing-on package when moving from the New York Stock Exchange. Thain received $83.1m despite the bank's losses of $19bn on mortgage-related securities, which have prompted it to sell assets and raise money from Asian sovereign wealth funds.</p> <p>In third place was Leslie Moonves of television network CBS \u2014 the maker of hits such as CSI and Everybody Loves Raymond \u2014 who got $67.6m. Behind him were the bosses of metals group Freeport-McMoRan and energy company XTO.</p> <p>US investors are not entitled to vote on executive pay packages in the way they are in Britain. Efforts to institute a \"say on pay\" vote by shareholders at annual meetings have largely failed, with a few exceptions \u2014 such as at computer maker Apple, telecoms firm Verizon and video rental empire Blockbuster \u2014 where resolutions have passed against the wishes of the board.</p> <p>Several vocal pressure groups continue to push for pay restraint. A report from the US Institute for Policy Studies, together with United for a Fair Economy, this week concluded taxpayers in effect subsidise boardroom pay to the tune of $20bn annually through loopholes allowing companies to pay executives offshore, to minimise capital gains tax or defer taxation.</p> <p>Sarah Anderson, co-author of the study, said the rewards enjoyed by energy bosses were attracting particular ire. \"They've really been cashing in even though executives admit they don't have any control over global oil prices.\" </p> <p>The presidential election has provided hope for campaigners. Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain say they support legislation presently stalled in Congress which would require companies to hold a \"say on pay\" vote annually.</p> <p>Obama favours closing a so-called \"carried interest\" loophole which limits capital gains tax on fees and bonuses. </p> <p>McCain has railed against \"rewards for failure\" when outgoing chief executives get huge payoffs, telling a group of small business leaders in June: \"Something is seriously wrong when the American people are left to bear the consequences of reckless corporate conduct, while the offenders themselves are packed off with another $40m or $50m for the road.\"</p>",
  "<p>On the 35th anniversary of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d'\u00e9tat\">military overthrow</a> of Salvador Allende in Chile on September 11, 1973, which had the overt support of the United States, the presidents of <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN1048211320080911\">Bolivia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN1134158720080911\">Venezuela</a> have asked the US ambassadors accredited to their countries to leave. </p> <p>They both believe they are facing the possibility of an imminent coup d'etat in which they accuse the Americans of being involved. A third country, Paraguay, announced 10 days ago that it had detected a conspiracy involving military officers and opposition politicians. Latin America now faces its most serious crisis since the re-introduction of democratic practice at the end of the last century.</p> <p>Brazil and Argentina have both denounced the violent activities of opposition groups in Bolivia that have led to the closure of the natural gas pipelines to their countries, while President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela has warned that a coup against Evo Morales of Bolivia would be seen as a \"green light\" for an armed insurgency in that country.</p> <p>Giving details of a planned coup in his own country, in which retired military officers and opposition figures were involved, Ch\u00e1vez announced the expulsion of the US ambassador, Patrick Duddy, and the withdrawal of his own ambassador from Washington. Any aggression against Venezuela, Ch\u00e1vez said, would involve a halt in the supply of <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/Venezuela/Background.html\">Venezuelan oil</a> to the United States.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez's decision came one day after President Morales had thrown out the US ambassador in La Paz, Philip Goldberg, who has been frequently accused by the Bolivian government of plotting with the separatist politicians in the eastern province of Santa Cruz. </p> <p>The situation in Bolivia is immediately more dramatic than in Venezuela, although both countries are facing important electoral battles at the end of the year. </p> <p>Evo Morales, an indigenous politician from the Andes in the west of the country, has organised a referendum on a new constitution to which the rightwing (and white racist) politicians in the eastern lowlands are bitterly opposed. The atmosphere of violence has now <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/12/america/LA-Bolivia-Protests.php\">broken into the open</a>, with endless political demonstrations and several deaths, the seizure of provincial airports, and sabotage of the oil and gas installations on which the country's economy depends. Morales has accused the regional governors of the five eastern regions of creating the conditions for a coup.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez originally announced his decision to expel the US ambassador from Caracas as an act of solidarity with Morales \u2013 \"so that Bolivia is not alone\". But it was soon clear that he had his own possible coup d'etat to deal with. A tape recording of phone conversations between retired military officers, some of whom were involved in the failed coup of April 2002, was broadcast on Venezuelan television on Wednesday night, revealing plans to seize the Miraflores presidential palace and to capture or shoot down the presidential plane. </p> <p>The suggestion that there were plans to assassinate the president brought large crowds down from the shanty towns on Thursday night to demonstrate their solidarity with Ch\u00e1vez. Several of the alleged conspirators have been detained. Venezuela, like Bolivia, has an uncertain pre-election climate, since there will be regional and municipal elections in November that will be viewed as a judgment on the popularity of the president. </p> <p>The possible coup in Paraguay appears less serious, since it only appeared to involve preliminary discussions between retired General Lino Oviedo, an old hand at failed coups, and a serving officer. Yet since the government of the left-wing former bishop, Fernando Lugo, has only been in power since August, tales of a possible coup have reverberated through the continent. Brazil declared pointedly that it would not tolerate a coup in Bolivia \"or in any other Latin American country\". </p> <p>The US is, of course, preoccupied with Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, but whichever presidential candidate takes over in January will also find Latin America at the top of his in-tray.</p>",
  "<p>The \"social scourge\" of excessive boardroom pay has prompted widespread debate in the European Union as workers see their purchasing power eroded by \u00adrising prices and low wage increases. European political leaders have demanded a legal and fiscal clampdown.</p> <p>Shareholders, especially retail investors, are pressing for greater corporate disclosure of remuneration policy, inc\u00adlu\u00adding links to performance, and individual directors' pay packages as well as votes on the issue at annual meetings.</p> <p>The pay debate has been exacerbated by the credit crunch, which has exposed undue risk-taking in the search for higher bonuses by highly paid investment bankers and high-profile severance packages for failed executives, deepening the sense of outrage in mainland Europe, which is culturally more egalitarian than the US or Britain.</p> <p>Even before Pat Russo, chief executive of serially loss-making IT firm Alcatel-Lucent, quit in late July with a contractual pay-off of up to \u20ac6m (\u00a34.8m), French president Nicolas Sarkozy had produced draft laws to curb such \"golden parachutes\".</p> <p>The Dutch government has introduced legislation for a 30% tax on bonuses of more than \u20ac500,000 and a 15% increase in employer's fiscal contributions to executive pensions, partly influenced by the multimillion pay-off for ABN Amro chief Rijkman Groenink.</p> <p>In Germany, where workers' pay rose only 4.3% between 2003 and 2007 as firms laid off hundreds of thousands of employees, Social Democrats are demanding a \u20ac1m ceiling on tax-deductible boardroom remuneration.</p> <p>It is the widening gap between boardroom and shopfloor remuneration in a deteriorating economic environment that is fuelling the furore. The growing evidence is that mainland European companies are following the lead of their British counterparts by setting executive remuneration packages, including stock options, at a level commensurate with global \u2014 not national \u2014 peers in an effort to retain and incentivise directors.</p> <p>Executive pay in the EU averages \u20ac5m a year. French chief executives are said to be the highest paid with packages worth \u20ac6m after a reported 58% leap in 2007. A recent survey by the German DSW investor lobby found that German executive pay had risen 7.75% in 2007 to just below \u20ac3m, with Josef Ackermann of Deutsche Bank the top earner with \u20ac14m, though Wendelin Wiedeking of unlisted Porsche earned more than four times that.</p> <p>It is this degree of corporate generosity that prompted Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the EU's euro group, to label it a \"social scourge\".</p> <p>Disclosure practices vary widely across the European Union despite a four-year-old non-binding European commission recommendation to increase corporate remuneration transparency on individual executive pay and remuneration policies as a whole.</p> <p>A European commission report last year found greater transparency had ensued but responses had been patchy, with only a third of member states enabling even an advisory shareholder vote on executive remuneration. In Germany, where only 40% of the top 30 firms in the Dax have remuneration committees and most annual reports detail just the package of the highest earner, even that stipulation causes anger among directors.</p>",
  "<p>After years of questioning the scientific consensus, Sarah Palin switched her position yesterday on the origins of climate change, agreeing that human activity contributes to rising global temperatures.</p> <p>\"I believe that man's activities certainly can be contributing to the issue of global warming, climate change,\" Palin told ABC news, in her first mainstream interview since John McCain chose her as his vice-presidential nominee.</p> <p>Palin had previously cast doubt on the cause of rapid Arctic sea ice melting in her home state of Alaska. One day before she joined the Republican ticket in August, she told conservative website NewsMax: \"I'm not one \u2026 who would attribute [climate change] to being man-made.\"</p> <p>Palin's shift brings her more in line with McCain, who has acknowledged that warming comes from the burning of fossil fuels and vowed to regulate US carbon emissions as president. </p> <p>But the Alaska governor also expressed sympathy with fellow conservatives who continue to believe \u2013 in the face of broad scientific consensus \u2013 that observed climate change is a natural variation unrelated to human activity. </p> <p>\"Whether it's entirely, wholly caused by man's activities or is part of the cyclical nature of our planet, the warming and the cooling trends \u2013 regardless of that, John McCain and I agree that we've got to do something about it,\" Palin said.</p> <p>She also challenged ABC anchor Charles Gibson to produce proof of her prior denial of the origins of climate change: \"Show me where I have ever said that there's absolute proof that nothing that man has ever conducted or engaged in has had any effect or no effect on climate change.\"</p> <p>Eight months before Palin's NewsMax interview, she told a local Alaska newspaper: \"I'm not an Al Gore, doom-and-gloom environmentalist blaming the changes in our climate on human activity\". And before her 2006 election as governor, her spokesman said Palin believed \"the jury is still out\" on the origins of climate change.</p> <p>While Palin's shift towards the McCain position on climate change may comfort US environmentalists seeking a carbon cap next year, her confident support for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is sure to agitate the green movement.</p> <p>McCain, who opposed most new drilling before this year, now strongly backs adding oil rigs to the American coastlines. He hinted that he may soon assent to opening the protected ANWR area in Alaska to oil companies.</p> <p>Palin, a vocal proponent of ANWR drilling, told ABC that she felt McCain would come to see the issue from her point of view.</p> <p>\"We'll agree to disagree, but I'm gonna keep pushing that [with McCain] and I think eventually we're all going to come together on that one,\" she said.</p>",

Just as he was getting ready repairing to roll out the combine harvester and bring in the 40% of the wheat and barley that was left in the fields at the end of August, it started raining. And raining. And raining. </p> <p>In the past few weeks, three or four inches of water have fallen on every part of Jack and his two brothers' farm, north of Newcastle. The rain has been some of the heaviest and most intense Britain has known in a generation, and the scale of the disaster to farmers and the national harvest is now becoming apparent. </p> <p>Storey's crop is lying down, beginning to sprout and go black round the edges, but he says he is relatively fortunate. \"June was bad but we haven't had more than four or five summer days all year. People round here are now desperate to get their harvest in. It's the biggest single element of the income \u2013 60% or more. We've combined 60% of our crop but there are farmers here who have not even started.\"</p> <p>His experience is echoed across Britain. According to the <a href=\"http://www.nfuonline.com/\">National Farmers' Union</a> (NFU), 2008 was expected to be one of the best harvests ever, but it is now shaping up to be the worst in 40 years. Nearly a third of all wheat is still uncut and heavy harvesting machines have been barely able to get on to the sodden land for weeks. Thousands of acres of oil seed rape have been ploughed back into the ground, and the pea and outdoor-grown fruit crop harvests have been largely ruined. Meanwhile, potatoes and other root crops are in danger of rotting and UK honey harvest is expected to be half its usual size.</p> <p>Guy Gagen, chief arable adviser at the NFU, says: \"Fields have been flooded and it has been impossible to access crops. For wheat and barley in particular, the harvest is both difficult and expensive in terms of gathering and drying wet, sodden crops. Farmers say it compares to 1968, which was very similar, with heavy rain throughout the summer.\"</p> <p>\"We just need a break in the weather. If we get that for five to seven days farmers can recover, In the meantime, a lot of farmers are very desperate. It's very serious for individuals everywhere\". </p> <p>In Cornwall, farmers have barely seen two consecutive days without rain for almost two months. Mike Hambley, vice chair of the NFU's south-west arable board, has lost his entire oat crop: \"They leaned over on themselves and sprouted badly and we have had no chance to go out and get them.\"</p> <p>Farmers say they have been hit by four things at the same time. The torrential, non stop rains have led to lower yields and quality; good harvests around the world this year have seen cereal prices dropping; and high fuel prices mean they are paying more to dry their crops. In addition, many have been unable to prepare the ground and plant seed for next year. </p> <p>\"The UK is the only country with all these problems\", says Rachael Gillbanks, an NFU spokeswoman in York.</p> <p>Industry experts are now revising down their estimates for the total wheat yield. Early forecasts were that it would be as much as 16.5m tonnes, but this will be cut by at least 10%. Crop consultants <a href=\"http://www.adas.co.uk/sustainable_crop_management/index.html\">Adas</a> say about 5m tonnes of wheat is still waiting to be cut and the quality of those crops is deteriorating. \"There is really very little progress. It is obviously affecting wheat quite badly,\" says analyst Susan Twining.</p> <p>Lindsay Hargreaves, farm manager of the 20,000 acre Elveden estate near Thetford in Norfolk, has thousands of acres of cereals in the ground. \"To have 20% of the harvest still in the field at this point in September is very unusual. I would expect it in by the end of August. But there are places which still have 80% of their crop to bring in.\"</p> <p>He says that extreme weather is hitting Britain more and more frequently. \"The dilemma is whether this is a trend or a blip. Should I be gearing the business in a different way? Our [farm] weather records go back to 1894 and they show very clearly that in the last five years, compared to any other five years in all that time, the pattern is a greater intensity of rain in the summer.\"</p> <p>Farmers are beginning to adapt to a clearly changing climate, says Gagen. \"They are turning to machines which have caterpillar tracks to allow them to work on wetter fields, choosing varieties of wheat that are more resistant to sprouting, and applying anti-fungal sprays. They are also investing more in drying facilities, clubbing together to join central storage facilities, sharing machinery and adapting all the time.\"</p> <p>Back in Northumberland, Jack Storey is perplexed. \"I have never known it like this. We can take a few terrible weeks but it has not stopped. The harvest is slipping through our fingers now. It's a real mess.\"</p>",
  "<p><br>In search of the maestro ... You get a real intimate sense of Mozart in Salzburg. Photograph: Roland Grant Archive</p> <p>It's the last day of our family trip to Salzburg and the last day of my bid to turn my two children into Mozart aficionados. Mozart spent most of his time in Salzburg working for the archbishop, so it felt only fitting to start the day in <a href=\"http://www.smart.net/~tak/Patrons/rupert.html\">St Rupert's Cathedral</a> where he worked, and where he was baptised. If you're a fan of choral music, St Rupert's is the business. The singing here is heavenly, the organ playing is divine, and the best time to hear them come together is during mass, in this cavernous cathedral for which Mozart, a devout Catholic, wrote some of his most lovely melodies.</p> <p>Our kids actually go to church fairly regularly when we're back home, but we're bog standard C of E, and they're certainly not used to sitting through an entire service in German. I had my doubts whether they'd last the distance \u2013 they're only eight and four, after all \u2013 but they both did pretty well, and I like to think the music had a lot to do with it. It certainly knocked the stuffing out of Songs of Praise. High up in the balcony, hidden from the congregation, the sound of the choir filled this vast dome, and the effect was spectacular. You didn't need to be remotely religious to feel overwhelmed.</p> <p>Our final bit of Mozart was another concert, a recital of his <a href=\"www.skg.co.at\">majestic Requiem</a> - the last thing he ever wrote, still unfinished when he died, aged just 35. It's performed every week in his local church, the <a href=\"http://www.sacred-destinations.com/austria/salzburg-kollegienkirche-collegiate-church.htm\">Kollegienkirche</a>, just across the street from his Geburtshaus, and this setting is sublime. The acoustics aren't the greatest, but somehow that hardly seems to matter. You feel really close to Mozart here, and I found the whole experience intensely moving. Though the exterior of the church is splendid the interior is a bit dilapidated, yet for me this merely heightened its emotional appeal.</p> <p>But what about the children? Were they just as thrilled? Well, my daughter Thea (aged four) didn't last long - my wife had to take her out after about ten minutes - but to my surprise (and pride and pleasure) my son Edward (aged eight) was mesmerised. And to top it all, at the end Thea came back in to join in the applause. She'd been listening with her mum outside.</p> <p>So, after five days in Salzburg, what do my kids think of Mozart? Have they been transformed into avid fans, or do they never want to hear his name again? Well, I wouldn't say they're fanatical, but it's certainly enhanced their interest. Now they feel it's something they really know about, and they're right \u2013 they really do. Despite the camera-clicking sightseers, you get a really intimate sense of Mozart here \u2013 much more intimate, in a way, than someone who knows his music inside out but has never been.</p> <p>When we got back home to London, Edward and Thea slumped down in front of the telly. But instead of switching on Cbeebies, as usual, I put on an old video of Ingmar Bergman's Magic Flute, and went to make their tea. When I came back in half an hour later, they were still watching, both enthralled.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/sep/08/makemychildamozartloverd\">Make my child a Mozart lover: Day one</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/sep/09/makemychildamozartloverd1\">Make my child a Mozart lover: Day two</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/musicblog/2008/sep/10/make.my.child.a.mozart.lover.day.three\">Make my child a Mozart lover: Day three</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/sep/11/classicalmusicandopera\">Make my child a Mozart lover: Day four</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Gimme Shelter</strong></p> <p>Has the credit crunch taken a bite out of the West End? It depends who you believe. Marguerite's producers cite the economic climate as one of the reasons for the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre/news/west-end-musical-to-close-905442.html\"> show's early closure</a>, while a recent report reveals that <a href=\"http://blog.discounttheatre.com/theatre-thrives-despite-the-credit-crunch/\"> ticket sales actually increased over summer</a> - suggesting that cash-strapped punters still valued escapism. Those losing sleep over the risk of recession might do well to avoid the Globe, whose Timon of Athens, with a plot about dire financial straits, was dubbed a <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/theatre/show-23574466-details/Timon+Of+Athens/showReview.do?reviewId=23528390\">\"credit-crunch tragedy\"</a> by the Evening Standard this week.</p> <p>Meanwhile, homeless charity Shelter has found a West End stage for its Now Is The Time campaign, designed to show \"just how difficult it is for ordinary people to cope with spiralling housing costs, and how desperately unaffordable housing has become\". Shelter is hosting a benefit night at the Comedy Store with appearances by Reginald D Hunter, Robin Ince and Rob Deering. Tickets are only a tenner \u2013 well worth it, especially as the money raised goes towards helping Shelter's work with homeless children and families.</p> <p><strong>PC plod</strong></p> <p>Lord of the musical Andrew Lloyd Webber bemoaned a hissable villain in performing arts this week: political correctness, which he thinks is hampering creativity. In an interview with Closer magazine, he declared: \"Today people say you can't do this because it will offend that community, and then you can't say this because the Muslims will be offended by it and we'll end up being talked out of it. Talked out of ideas.\" The impresario's remarks echo a similar concern expressed earlier this year by Ben Elton, who suggested the BBC was \"scared\" of Islam jokes. On a lighter note, Lloyd Webber announced details of his next West End reality competition, which comes with a Crufts-style twist: in two years' time, he will be on the search for a warbling Dorothy \u2013 and waggy-tailed Toto - to star in The Wizard of Oz. The grooming starts now \u2026</p> <p><strong>Green theatre</strong></p> <p>The West End's environmental record was under the spotlight this week, as a report overseen by London mayor Boris Johnson \u2013 himself <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/08/climatechange.greenpolitics\"> heavily criticised by environmental campaigners</a> \u2013 revealed the carbon footprint of London's theatre industry. And it's pretty big. The annual emissions from theatre \u2013 including front of house, stage electricals, offices etc \u2013 are approximately 50,000 tonnes: \"roughly equivalent to driving a car 1.5 million times around the M25\". The report lays out a strategy to reduce the figure by 60% by 2025. Johnson singled out one piece of advice in the foreword to the report: \"if all central London theatres challenged the age-old practice of keeping stage-lights on and only switched them on half an hour before the performance, they could collectively <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/publications/2008/09/green-theatres.jsp\">save over \u00a3100,000 a year</a> in energy costs\". </p> <p><strong>Bugged out</strong></p> <p>An opera based on David Cronenberg's sci-fi horror film The Fly has premiered in America \u2013 and been promptly swatted by some critics. Variety's Alan Rich says: \"The Fly is a turkey \u2026 What's wrong? You name it.\" Reading Rich's review, it sounds like punters should be afraid \u2013 be very afraid \u2013 of the opera, which follows a scientist whose teleportation experiment goes haywire and turns him into an insect-a-like mutant. The show is directed by Cronenberg and conducted by Placido Domingo who, according to Rich, tries to spark up \"this lifeless lump\".</p> <p><strong>Fairytale opening</strong></p> <p>In Seattle, another movie has bounded onto the stage: the DreamWorks family favourite Shrek, new and improved with extra show tunes. Shrek: The Musical had its official opening at the 5th Avenue Theatre on Wednesday and has Broadway in its sights this winter, where it hopes to repeat the success of Hairspray, which was unveiled at the same Seattle theatre before it hit New York. Shrek is directed by Jason Moore, calls upon the backstage expertise of Chicago's Rob Ashford and has Sam Mendes on the production team. Brian d'Arcy James has been spending up to two hours each night getting a monster makeover for the lead role.</p>",
  "<p>Disillusioned with life as a top-flight football supporter? Sickened by the fact that your club has become nothing more than a tacky souvenir stand in the neon-tinged global hypermarket that is the Premier League? Fed up with being a <a href=\"http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps\">billionaire's plaything</a>? Does your chairman care as much for the club as a vulture cares for the feelings of its carrion? Or is he or she simply <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPmiRsRN-jw&amp;NR=1\">a bit of a berk</a>? Does your club have any soul left? Any at all? Want a club that does? Then why not head down to Spotland?</p> <p>It was a foggy afternoon in 1960 when the 10-year-old Chris Dunphy first walked the three miles down the Rochdale Road from his home in Milnrow to watch the Dale take on Peterborough. Nearly 50 years later, he's the chairman. In a footballing world growing greasy with oil money, Rochdale and Dunphy are anachronisms. They shouldn't really exist anymore. This season is their <a href=\"http://www.fchd.info/ROCHDALE.HTM\">35th on the bounce</a> in the bottom tier of the Football League. Attendances hover precariously <a href=\"http://www.tonykempster.co.uk/div3att.htm\">just above 3,000</a>. But the fact that the chairman is a lifelong supporter who grew up a stone's throw from the ground is perhaps most unusual of all.</p> <p>It's a little more than 12 miles from Eastlands to Spotland, but the contrast between the clubs could hardly be greater. While Manchester City have just spent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/sep/02/manchestercity.chelsea1\">\u00a332.5m on Robinho</a> and put him on \u00a3160,000 a week, Rochdale eke by on free transfers and out-of-contract signings. While City ponder <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/sep/02/manchestercity.manchesterunited\">\u00a3135m bids</a>, the Dale's idea of pushing the boat out was to <a href=\"http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/sport/football/rochdale/s/1057250_shaw_and_heslop_on_plane_to_spain\">splash \u00a360,000</a> on a Conference striker this summer. The Abu Dhabi group made their billions in the oil-rich gulf, Dunphy's company offices are based at the ground. They make and install heating systems for churches.</p> <p>But does it make any difference to the supporters that a fan is in charge of the club? \"I don't honestly know. I think given the choice they'd probably prefer a rich Arab, but unfortunately I don't know any,\" chuckles Dunphy. \"I'm being a bit tongue in cheek there. I do get a good reception. People stop me when I'm doing the shopping on a Saturday. My wife wanders off to do it on her own because she knows that if someone buttonholes me about football then that's it for the morning. </p> <p>\"I think the supporters know that I'm not going to do anything silly with the club. We got just a little bit of success last season, so we've got a flavour of that, and if we could just push on I don't think any of our supporters would genuinely believe we're on our way to the Premier League. If they did it might take a little bit of the charm out of the club actually, because it is a very friendly club is Rochdale.\"</p> <p>The chances of Rochdale interesting an Abramovich or a Middle Eastern royal family may not be much bigger than an electron on Atkins but Dunphy may have a point when he questions why a club like the Dale shouldn't be attractive for those wanting to get ahead in the popularity stakes.</p> <p>\"I'm always amazed \u2013 I wonder at the reasons why they do it,\" he says. \"I can't understand the guys who have just bought Manchester City for however much it is \u2013 surely they don't expect to have a trading profit on the company? </p> <p>\"If someone was buying a club for immortality, for recognition, why don't they buy a club like Rochdale? Because for four or five million pounds they could take us up the leagues and have almost guaranteed immortality, if only in a small circle. I think these people have different motives, and to be honest I just don't understand what they are.\"</p> <p>Dunphy's motives are certainly clearer \u2013 a genuine passion for the club plays a major role. He first joined the board for a brief spell in 1980 (leaving the club due to his temporary departure from the Rochdale area 18 months later) and returned in Easter 1990, becoming chairman in 2006. Last season saw the club come closer than ever to ending their marathon stay on the Football League's lowest rung, but a 3-2 defeat against Stockport in the play-off final at Wembley ended those hopes. That raised optimism ahead of the new campaign, although a slow start \u2013 one win in five \u2013 has dampened the mood somewhat. Nevertheless the club has a stability that is the envy of many in the lower reaches.</p> <p>\"There was a time when I'd have said that the days of clubs Rochdale's size were numbered,\" says Dunphy. \"But I think we've bucked the trend actually. We've got a very small fan base, but we are punching above our weight.</p> <p>\"We're a club that have stayed solvent throughout the years when there's so many of us gone bang. There's a lot of clubs where you do worry. There's some clubs that I don't know how they stay in existence, I really don't. There's so many that've gone to the wall.\"</p> <p>And there's little disguising Dunphy's irritation at those clubs who have failed to cut their cloth as carefully as Rochdale. The punishments handed down to Rotherham, Bournemouth and Luton this season seem harsh to many (myself included), but Dunphy feels they don't go far enough. \"My opinion is that when a club goes into receivership or liquidation, they should lose the golden share and drop out of the league,\" he says. \"I think it's grossly unfair when we go to places like Bradford City, who have wiped off debts of \u00a338m and been bust twice, and the likes of Rotherham, who've been bust three times and wiped off their debts. It's absolutely scandalous. </p> <p>\"I think they should drop out and start again from the bottom. Leicester City - a fine example - had a new stadium built for \u00a350m and then go bust. We've been very careful in balancing the books and we've languished at the bottom end of the Football League because of it.\"</p> <p>The determination of the club to live within its means may irk some supporters (and, to be fair, after three-and-a-half decades in the fourth division, if any fans have a right to a bit of a grumble, it's <a href=\"http://rochdaleafcblog.blogspot.com/\">those who line the terraces at Spotland</a>), but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPmiRsRN-jw&amp;feature=related\">it could be worse</a>. \"Oh, he's a prat,\" says Dunphy. \"I don't need to put a shirt on for people to know that I'm a fan. I think everybody in Rochdale knows that, thankfully. We've only got a few thousand supporters and I probably know most of them personally. I have occasionally stood behind the goal. I go and talk to the fans, I'll have a pint with them in the pub before the game but my job's in the boardroom.\"</p> <p>Away from the boardroom and out on the pitch, Keith Hill's team have stuttered to a slow start, although five points from five games equals their opening to last season, which, of course, ended up at Wembley. Goals have been a problem\u2013 something of a surprise for a side who can field <a href=\"http://touchline.onthespot.co.uk/guardian/StatsCentre.asp?Lang=0&amp;CTID=11&amp;CPID=69&amp;pStr=Player&amp;PLID=181192&amp;TEID=515\">Chris Dagnall</a> and <a href=\"http://touchline.onthespot.co.uk/guardian/StatsCentre.asp?Lang=0&amp;CTID=11&amp;CPID=69&amp;pStr=Player&amp;PLID=189161&amp;TEID=515\">Adam Le Fondre</a> up front and also have the promising <a href=\"http://touchline.onthespot.co.uk/guardian/StatsCentre.asp?Lang=0&amp;CTID=11&amp;CPID=69&amp;pStr=Player&amp;PLID=178066&amp;TEID=515\">Jon Shaw</a> available. Expectations were raised on the back of last season's successes and Dunphy is keen to emphasize the competitiveness of the division. Nevertheless he remains determined to keep the club moving forward.</p> <p>\"There've been some occasions since I've taken over when you wake up in the morning and think 'bloody hell, am I still chairman?' It's one of those jobs that is 24/7. In the early days, we weren't doing very well, we'd just changed the manager and one thing and another. I went behind the goals when we played Bury. Now I'm a big supporter, but I have other things in my life. But I saw the passion of the supporters there and it really hit home to me.

  "<p>In response to the release of Warwick University's latest study which shows that institutional racism in Britain's state educational system is to blame for educational differences between black and white children, Lee Jasper has <br><a href=\"http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5hrdXGwFBknsEi1ioOEX15emqQibQ\">called for the creation of all-black schools</a> as a solution to the problem. </p> <p>Jasper was reported as saying \"\u2026it's time the black community ran its own schools, devised a curriculum that suited the needs of our children, employed teachers that look like the young people they are teaching.\"</p> <p>In arguing for black schools, Jasper draws parallels with America and South Africa, saying: \"Some of the greatest black leaders in the world \u2013 Dr Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, to name just two \u2013 attended all-black schools and universities. The US has many historically black colleges and universities. They cater for the needs of the African-American and they excel.\" </p> <p>America currently has <a href=\"http://www.doi.gov/hrm/black.html\">105 Historically Black Colleges and Universities</a> (HBCUs) and it is indeed true that many of the country's most notable African-Americans were educated at those institutions.</p> <p>In fact, until the mid 20th century, around <a href=\"http://education.stateuniversity.com/pages/2046/Historically-Black-Colleges-Universities.html\">90% of African-Americans were educated at HBCUs</a> and they currently account for 24% of African American graduates \u2013 a large number considering that HBCUs only make up 3% of American universities. </p> <p>HBCUs have also been said to \"provide a nurturing, supportive, affirming environment for aspiring black youth. They\u2026are the educational institutions that most contributed to the creation and continued expansion of a black middle class in the United States.\" In essence, they have been and continue to be vital to African Americans' progress. </p> <p>Whilst there is a lot to be learned from the HBCU model Jasper's comparison of the UK to the US, however, in this regard is a fundamental mistake. <br>HBCUs arose as a response to slavery and then found a continued need when, during segregation, states did not allow black students into white schools. </p> <p>Like South Africa, America was once drastically split between white and black, with the two groups having quite distinct perspectives and ideologies along racial, political and cultural lines. </p> <p>While a 44.9% A-C grade achievement for black British students compared to 57.3% for white students is certainly not something to applaud, the fact is that \u2013 without wanting to downplay the very real racial issues that still exist in the UK \u2013 we are far from the segregation that gave rise to the need for separate educational facilities for African-American and black South African students. </p> <p>Furthermore, having been in existence since 1837, HBCU's have had a long time to develop, cultivate a strong network of high-quality teachers in black institutions who understand how they work, as well as expand on a strong ideological, intellectual and political framework \u2013 evolving from slavery, into segregation, through the civil rights movement and onto today. </p> <p>In the UK the black British story has yet to be told or studied in any serious capacity, which makes it harder to ground schools inside the framework of a cultural history in the same way. </p> <p>Jasper's comments suggest that black Britons have a clear, collective, consensual \u2013 and positive \u2013 notion of black Britishness that would benefit black students being taught in black schools. The lack of that commonly held belief system is another reason why such schools cannot necessarily be compared to faith schools \u2013 another model Jasper gives \u2013 some of which such as Muslim or Jewish schools have and teach an ideology, shared by those who choose to send their children there, that diverges from the mainstream.</p> <p>Jasper assumes, perhaps naively, that ideas about racial superiority or inferiority are carried on only by white teachers, but the idea that black teachers do not carry negative ideas about black children is questionable. I have met many black people with entrenched, negative views about the possible successes of black kids, and many others with conflicting notions about what it means to be black in Britain today. </p> <p>In fact, many HBCUs have some white teaching staff. The issue is not so much the colour of the teachers, but that they are committed to seeking out excellence and brilliance within black students. It is that which is currently missing from the UK's educational system and which needs to be fostered in all teachers, and all schools \u2013 not just black ones. </p> <p>Another question is whether or not a black teacher is what makes the difference in the academic achievement of black children. Although the government has been on a drive since 2007 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/02/race.schools\">to recruit more black teachers</a>. </p> <p>I would argue that having a good teacher, regardless of their race, is what's most important. </p> <p>There is no doubt that some black people would like their children to attend black schools, and that choice should be available to them. However, with the British government unlikely to provide funds for black schools this means that many are likely to be fee-paying, which will still make them inaccessible to many of the children who need them the most. This means, therefore, that the issue of institutional racism in British schools as a whole still needs to be addressed and dealt with. </p> <p>I can understand Jasper's point of view \u2013 and it's certainly not the first time he has suggested it \u2013 but at this point focusing on creating all-black schools, rather than tackling the racism pointed out in Strand's report, would be more like placing than a plaster on an open sore than providing an effective solution. </p> <p>Just as the McPherson report laid out specific plans and proposals for overturning institutional racism within the police force, precise, actionable and adequate reforms are needed to tackle low teacher expectations and other issues that play a significant role in black under-achievement. I don't believe that all-black schools are currently the most effective, or the only, answer. </p>",
  "<p>When you hear the term \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7288952.stm\">forced marriage</a>\" you probably picture a British Asian girl sent on a visit to the sub-continent under false pretences, then married to a local man and threatened with violence if she refuses.<br> While this harrowing scenario may represent the majority of cases, there are other victims whose voices have yet to be heard.  Along with issues such as domestic violence and eating disorders, forced marriages have traditionally been perceived as having only female victims. While the bulk of resources should be dedicated towards helping females forced to wed, this should not be to the extent of neglecting male victims. <a href=\"http://www.positiveeast.org.uk/\">Positive East</a> is a counselling service in east London which has given support to men who have been forced into marriage. One of those it helped is 25-year-old Arza, who was taken to Pakistan and forced into marriage at the age of 19. <br> He said: \"I used to wear make-up and dress in women's clothes, and knew I was gay when I was a teenager. [My family] said my grandmother was ill, so we went to Pakistan. They said, 'If you don't marry, your mother will have a heart attack from the shock.' I was scared they would disown me and kick me out if I refused. I suffered from depression, mental health issues which were alcohol-fuelled. I kept saying to myself 'How do I lead both lives?' It was very difficult to get a divorce, my family wanted us to stay together. They wanted to protect their honour.\" Another British Asian with a similar experience is Randeep, who was forced into marriage when he was 24. Now aged 30, he told <a href=\"http://www.easterneyeonline.co.uk/\">Eastern Eye</a>: \"All the family went to India together, for a 'visit'. They said I had to get married. I felt isolated and under a lot of pressure. I told her, 'You will be spoiling the girl's life and my life'. She said, 'What will people think if you don't get married?' She only cared about <em>izzat</em> [honour].\"<br> The government's <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/fco-in-action/nationals/forced-marriage-unit/\">Forced Marriage Unit</a> (FMU) recently turned its attention to this issue by publishing a <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/foced-marriage-lgbt\">booklet</a> for the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community. While its intention is to be commended, where was the big launch to publicise the booklet? Instead of the booklet being available from support groups, it should be handed out to people at events so they are fully aware of the help available to them.<br> More girls forced into marriage are now coming forward because the issue is high on the agenda in the media, MPs are championing the cause, and more support services are available. A similar environment needs to be created for male victims who are too frightened for their safety and tarnishing their family's honour to speak out. Of the calls to the Forced Marriage Unit last year, 15% were from men. But campaign groups I spoke to use worrying terminology like \"hidden issue\" and \"unrecognised aspect\" - which reaffirms that the size of the problem is not yet known. It would be naive to take this ratio as reflective of the extent of the problem, which is why the FMU must prompt more men to come forward and share their experiences. Currently, there are a host of ethnic and religious support groups and refuges for women. But where do men in the same position go? More groups which cater for women need to be given the means to open their doors for men. It has been a rocky year for women's support groups such as the renowned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/28/women.gender\">Southall Black Sisters</a> with their funding by local councils under threat, and the pressure on them to merge with mainstream groups. The onus is on the government to provide more unisex groups along with understanding the importance of having culturally sensitive services where the experience of a British Asian male will differ from a black British male for example, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach.<br> <a href=\"http://www.karmanirvana.org.uk/\">Karma Nirvana</a> is currently carrying out research into the need for male refuge provision. The male support workers I spoke to suggest there is an overwhelming need for male refuges to ensure the safety of victims who want to flee their forced marriage. There are few services already in place such as Aquarius, who offer limited bed space for male victims. But unless your support worker has contacts in housing associations, these men are left with a unenviable position: either live on the street, in fear your relatives will hunt you down, or remain in the forced marriage.<br> And how do we stop situations which cross the line between arranged and forced marriage? The sensible route would be tougher punishments such as prosecuting relatives complicit in forcing people to marry against their will. In Scotland a Bill is currently going through parliament where relatives will be fined and forced to do community service if they are found guilty of <a href=\"http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/latestnews?articleid=3906435\">aiding a forced marriage</a>. A similar proposal in England was <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5054286.stm\">dropped</a> in 2006 because of the pressure it would put on victims to testify against their relatives. But surely that would be less of a problem if they were granted anonymity and could receive counselling to rebuild their lives.</p>",

He has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/apr/25/evolution.religion\">previously criticised Dawkins</a> for his views on faith and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/audio/2007/jun/04/science814\">has said that he is suffering from a \"science delusion\"</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Far too many scientists including my good friend Richard Dawkins present science as the truth and present it as factually correct.

I think that is a very dangerous message because I think actually it is irresponsible. I think it poo-poos other people's views of a universe about which none of us know clearly or absolutely.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As an example of misplaced scientific certainty Winston said the traditional \"determinist\" approach to genetics was proving to be too simplistic.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We can't any longer have the conventional understanding of genetics which everybody pedals because it is increasingly obvious that epigenetics \u2013 actually things which influence the genome's function \u2013 are much more important than we realised \u2026 One of the most important aspects of what makes us who we are is neither straight genes or straight environment but actually what happens to us during development.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Winston also criticised the notion \u2013 popularised by developmental biologist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2006/dec/12/scienceweekly1\">Prof Lewis Wolpert</a> at University College London \u2013 that science can be separated from technology and the application of science. After praising Wolpert as a \"really significant scientist\", Winston said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I love Lewis, he's a wonderful man, but he's barmy. He presents science as the total truth \u2013 it's a nonsense.\"</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>\"You can't do that. [Science and its applications] are interconnected aren't they. That's the problem. The use of science is dependent on the science that we produce.

  "<p>It is a crying shame that Jim Jefferies' autobiography was penned while he still managed Hearts.

Killie will run out at Ibrox tomorrow afternoon as joint leaders of Scotland's top division, with a goal difference column which shows their net has not bulged so much as once in the current campaign.</p> <p>Nobody is suggesting Jefferies will oversee a meaningful challenge to the Old Firm this season; he won't, even if odds of 16/1 for Kilmarnock to finish as the \"best of the rest\" appear overly generous. To put it into context, Killie's sole championship success came in 1965. Yet the 57-year-old is due fulsome praise for his continued knack of producing entertaining teams, against a backdrop of severe financial uncertainty.</p> <p>The irony is that Jefferies himself would not have expected to last as long as the six years and seven months he has managed at Rugby Park - a tenure which makes him the longest-serving manager in the league. The regular loss of key players - Kris Boyd, Colin Nish and Steven Naismith to name but three \u2013 because of economic reality would not have been met with approval from managers of a lower calibre. Kilmarnock's majority shareholder and chairman, Michael Johnston, has admitted he has no personal wealth to plough into the club with a heavy bank debt ensuring Jefferies' hands are further tied as far as new arrivals are concerned.</p> <p>But it is amid such trying circumstances that the manager has flourished. Jefferies' strength has been in continuing to supplement his squad from the transfer market's bargain basket. David Fernandez, once of Celtic, the Moroccan midfielder Mehdi Taouil and Craig Bryson, who arrived in Ayrshire from Clyde, have supplied the creative spark this season. That Jeffries was able to rest nine first-team players for Kilmarnock's recent home victory over Hamilton illustrates Jefferies' capacity for deal-making and squad-building; League Two clubs in England can and will pay higher wages than this SPL side.</p> <p>Kilmarnock's supporters, albeit notoriously difficult to please, were unconvinced by Jefferies's arrival. But regular forays into the SPL's financially-coveted Top Six and an attractive brand of football has won them round. And the manager's motivation, all along, seems to be that desire to find another Naismith, who was sold to Rangers for \u00a32m. </p> <p>Jefferies has the personal wealth to retire, but don't bank on him doing so until he feels completely fulfilled in his profession. Perhaps his current working conditions are a breeze in comparison to Hearts, where he ultimately lost almost all communication with Chris Robinson, the chief executive, and Bradford, where chairman Geoffrey Richmond had bestowed tens of thousands on under-achievers and left Jefferies to sort out the carnage therein.</p> <p>The manager retains the hard streak he was famed for at Hearts; Gary Wales turned up late for a pre-match meal before Kilmarnock's visit to Tynecastle in May. Wales not only failed to feature for the visitors that afternoon having been promptly sent home, but he did not pull on a blue and white shirt again and was freed in the close season.</p> <p>Kilmarnock may not win at Ibrox, in fact they probably won't. But few would bet against them maintaining their early season form thereafter. And if they do, Jefferies would be worthy of a move once again to a more lucrative environment, maybe even the Scotland national job, as reward for his service not only to Kilmarnock, but the Scottish game. Cue a re-write of that autobiography.</p>",

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337550546\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Airlines and travel companies are scrambling to bring British holidaymakers back home after the collapse of the UK's third largest tour operator.</p> <p>Phil Wyatt, chief executive of XL Leisure Group, said he was \"devastated\" by the collapse of his company, which was forced to call in the administrators in the early hours of the morning after the failure of last minute talks with financial backers Icelandic investment group Straumur.</p> <p>Wyatt said XL's management team had \"worked night and day\" to try to refinance the company. He admitted that the company had approached the Civil Aviation Authority a few weeks ago to warn of its precarious financial position but that it had been taking bookings right up until it folded.</p> <p>XL's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/theairlineindustry\">fleet of planes have been grounded</a>, leaving an estimated 85,000 people stranded abroad, while a further 200,000 have made advance bookings with the company, many of whom will lose out.</p> <p>Speaking at the Hilton Hotel at Gatwick Airport,Wyatt expressed his anger at the fact that he is not allowed to get his planes in the air. \"Unfortunately it's been deemed by the authorities - the government, whoever - that that's impossible. I personally don't believe that's the case.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.caa.co.uk/\">CAA</a> is working with other airlines and tour operators to organise repatriation flights for package holiday travellers stranded abroad.</p> <p>It reckons there are 50,000 tour operator customers of XL already on holiday abroad, a further 10,000 overseas who had booked with XL Airways, and 25,000 with other tour operators who shared the XL flights.</p> <p>Wyatt reckons there are fewer stranded passengers than the CAA estimates but that the organisation faces a massive challenge in getting them back home.</p> <p>\"The CAA, believe me, will have a huge challenge on their hands to re-protect 67,000 people that are overseas now - 67,000 people who could have flown back on XL Airways, that are going to come back on God-knows-what carriers that the CAA find.\"</p> <p>\"It's going to be the most challenging airlift, I believe, that anyone has undertaken.\" </p> <p>Other airlines have already scrambled to help the CAA. BMI was one of the first off the ground with an Airbus A320 sent out of Heathrow at 6.30am to bring stranded passengers back from Minorca.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ryanair\">Ryanair</a> is giving a fully staffed plane to the effort and will bring customers back for free. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/easyjet\">Easyjet</a> is charging a flat rate of \u00a375 - with one check-in bag - for XL customers stranded at overseas airports. The deal is open for the next seven days to any XL passenger who is not covered by ATOL protection.</p> <p>XL, which has a three-year sponsorship deal with football club West Ham that is worth \u00a32.5m annually and is only in its first season, ran flights to more than 50 destinations across Europe and Africa and sells through tour operator brands including The Really Great Holiday Company and Aspire Holidays.</p> <p><strong>Consumer protection<br></strong><br>Anyone who booked an inclusive holiday with XL or a charter flight through four of XL's numerous brands - The Really Great Holiday Company, Kosmar Villa Holidays, Freedom Flights or Aspire Holidays - will be covered by <a href=\"http://www.atol.org.uk/\">ATOL</a>'s financial protection scheme.</p> <p>But anyone who booked direct with XL Airways - whose flight numbers begin XLA - will have to either buy their way on to the CAA's specially organised flights or make their own way home.</p> <p>Package holidaymakers who booked with XL's Medlife business are also not covered by ATOL and anyone already abroad will not automatically be brought home.</p> <p>Other airlines are already reporting a massive increase in demand for flights as customers of XL, based in Crawley, West Sussex, try desperately to make alternative arrangements. The cost of a flight from Glasgow to Tenerife, for instance, has more than doubled to between \u00a3500 and \u00a3800. Prices for flights this evening have risen as high as \u00a31,800.</p> <p>The websites of both ATOL and the CAA, meanwhile, crashed this morning under the sheer weight of demand from worried XL customers. The helplines organised by the CAA, meanwhile, appeared permanently engaged.</p> <p>Anyone who booked their flights or a Medlife holiday with any credit card or a Visa debit card will be able to reclaim their money from their card issuer.</p> <p>Many passengers may also be covered by their travel insurance.</p> <p>Transport secretary Ruth Kelly said: \"The CAA have a wealth of experience in dealing with these sorts of situations and are putting systems in place to get people home, while the government stands ready to provide the CAA with operational assistance should they need it.\"</p> <p>The CAA has recommended that anyone expecting to travel with XL should not travel to the airport. But the first indication that anything was wrong for many holidaymakers came as they reached the check-in desks this morning only to discover that their flight had been cancelled. </p> <p>The company is the 26th travel firm to go bust in less than a year, forced under by the twin pressures of rising fuel costs and tough financial markets. Earlier this week <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/sep/11/theairlineindustry.spain\">Seguro Travel, which offered package deals to Gran Canaria and Costa Brava from Glasgow Prestwick airport, ceased trading</a> after the Spanish airline which operated 80% of its flights - Futura - launched insolvency proceedings in Palma on Monday. Budget airline <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/aug/29/zoom.air.travel\">Zoom, meanwhile, collapsed last month</a>.</p> <p><strong>'A huge failure'</strong></p> <p>XL's administrators Kroll said in a statement that its numerous businesses \"entered into administration having suffered as a result of volatile fuel prices, the economic downturn, and were unable to obtain further funding\".</p> <p>In a statement, XL's backers Straumur-Burdaras Investment Bank said it \"deeply regrets\" the collapse of the company and it is owed about \u20ac45m (\u00a335.8m) by the business.</p> <p>\"It is not clear at this stage to what extent this may be recovered,\" the company added.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/barclay\">Barclays</a>, meanwhile, is understood to be owed just under \u00a310m by the business.</p> <p>Straumur has bought out XL's German and French subsidiaries, whose customers are unaffected by the collapse of the UK operation.</p> <p>A spokesman for ATOL described XL UK's collapse as \"a huge failure\" and urged holidaymakers to be patient.</p> <p>\"With XL Airways no longer operating we are having to bring in substitute aircraft to bring people home. We ask people to be patient while we organise that ... bear with us, this is a huge failure. Our priority is the stranded passengers abroad and getting them back to the UK.</p> <p>\"Clearly if people do incur some additional costs, if they are delayed in their return, then they can put a claim in to the CAA under the ATOL scheme.\"</p> <p>In a statement, rival travel company <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/tuitravel\">TUI</a> - owner of Thomson and First Choice - called on the government to strengthen the protection given to holidaymakers when they book their trips, especially for holidaymakers who book online.</p> <p>\"In the current environment where the price of oil has increased substantially, we are continuously seeing airlines with less than robust business models failing,\" said Peter Long, chief executive, TUI Travel. \"This week alone both Futura and now XL have had to suspend or cease operations. Unfortunately, many people believe that they will be protected when this arises and this is not the case.\"</p> <p>\"Scheduled airlines, low cost airlines and online intermediaries, unlike tour operators, are not bonded which leaves their customers stranded or unable to get their money back in the event of failure. We at TUI Travel, as the leading European leisure travel company, will help where we can but it is time that the government realised that there needs to be a level playing field for all providers of overseas leisure travel arrangements.\"</p> <p>XL Leisure spans XL Airways UK Limited, Excel Aviation Limited, Explorer House Limited, Aspire Holidays Limited, Freedom Flights Limited, Freedom Flights (Aviation) Limited, The Really Great Holiday Company, Medlife Hotels Limited, Travel City Flights Limited and Kosmar Villa , all of which have been placed into administration.</p>",
  "<p>The government should introduce dedicated US-style yellow buses for all primary school children across Britain, an independent commission said today.</p> <p>The Yellow School Bus Commission, chaired by the former education secretary David Blunkett, said the scheme would give children a safe way of getting to and from school and cut congestion.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ysbcommission.com//reports/index.html\">year-long review</a> found that the number of children travelling to school by car has doubled in the last 20 years.</p> <p>In total 41% of primary and 21% of secondary school pupils are now being taken on the 'school run', representing around one in five of car trips during the morning rush hour. On some roads journey times can double, it found.</p> <p>The buses would also benefit the environment and improve children's attendance and punctuality, the commission argued.</p> <p>It wants to see all schools continue to promote walking and cycling for pupils living within one mile of primary school and two miles of secondary school.</p> <p>But dedicated school buses should be provided for primary school children living over one mile from school.</p> <p>Secondary school pupils should get dedicated buses if they live more than two miles from school in an area with limited services, serious behaviour problems with pupils on public buses, or if they can be linked up with primary schools.</p> <p>The Commission, which included members of all the main political parties, said the proposals would remove up to 180m unnecessary car journeys per year.</p> <p>A more flexible approach for secondary schools would take up to 50m more cars off the roads, costing between \u00a350m and \u00a3100m with estimated benefits of between \u00a391m and \u00a3194m each year.</p> <p>There would also be a net reduction of over 55,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per annum, the report concludes.</p> <p>The scheme would cost \u00a310,000 per school for dedicated buses. Parents would pay a fare of between \u00a31 and \u00a32 per day except for those entitled to free school meals or transport.</p> <p>There would be an additional annual cost of \u00a3154m and an estimated financial benefit of \u00a3460m a year to parents and road users. Parents alone would save \u00a392m.</p> <p>Blunkett called on government, locally and nationally, to take forward the recommendations.</p> <p>\"This is a forward-looking, realistic and highly relevant contribution to the debate not simply about transport, but about energy use, climate change and the sensible use and conservation of resources.</p> <p>\"This is about broad and highly relevant political issues as well as, crucially, the education, safety and security of our children. <br> \"We are proposing a long-term programme which could revolutionise the way we do the 'school run'. But this is not just about the length of time parents spend getting their children to school; it is also about the impact this has on both society and business and enterprise, as well as key issues of energy conservation and climate change.\"  A government spokesman said: \"Ensuring that children can travel to school safely is our primary concern. The DCSF provides \u00a320m a year to support school travel plans - typically around \u00a35,000 for a primary school and \u00a310,000 for a secondary. On top of this \u00a34m is provided to local authorities to produce sustainable transport plans and \u00a37.5m to fund school travel advisers.</p> <p>\"Given the clear health benefits to children we want to encourage walking and cycling where this is possible and reduce the number of unnecessary journeys by car, and the negative impact those journeys have on congestion and the environment while supporting parental choice about the school their child attends.</p> <p>\"This report will be valuable in developing future strategies to make this a reality. We will consider the reports findings carefully and respond in detail to its recommendations in due course.\"</p> <p>The Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) welcomed the findings but said it was disappointed to see the Commission still supports the \"anachronistic one mile rule\".</p> <p>Neil Greig, IAM's director of policy and research, said: \"Under these proposals we will still see yellow buses driving past soaked children just because they live the wrong side of an arbitrary line.\"</p>",

  "<p>As reported in the Guardian yesterday, the failure of policies to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/11/iran.afghanistan\">curb drug production in Afghanistan</a> is affecting Iran in a catastrophic way.</p> <p>Western attempts to tackle opium production have failed dismally, so much so that our country has become the main route for the opium trade from Afghanistan, with cheap drugs now widely available on every street corner to people in desperate situations. </p> <p>The result is an already vulnerable population is put at greater risk. The high number of male deaths from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-Iraq_War\">Iran-Iraq war</a> has resulted in many women struggling to earn enough to survive. Some of them become drug dealers and users. The Islamic Republic has to find better and more effective ways to support these women, most of whom are single mothers in desperate situations. <br> Poverty in Iran has been aggravated by the global economic crisis and rising food prices, worsened still by western sanctions that are hitting ordinary people hard.  I am going to tell you the stories of two unfortunate sisters whom I have known very closely and have tried to help regularly for many years: Layla, a 38-year-old divorcee and Sahar, a 33-year-old single mother from downtown Tehran with three teenage sons. Layla and Sahar's father died from cancer when they were teenagers, and were raised by their mother in a single parent family.  Because of the family's dire poverty, Layla was forced by her mother to marry an Afghani refugee in Iran in the late 1980s. After Layla's daughter Mina was born, Layla's husband was jailed for drug trafficking, which led not only to a decrease in family income but to a lack of family support. Almost immediately after her husband's arrest, Layla turned to soft drugs and eventually to opium, crack, and heroin. As her addictions worsened, she turned to prostitution to support them. After serving six years in prison, Layla's husband returned home. Upon his release, he took their daughter Mina without Layla's permission and returned to Afghanistan. Layla has not seen nor heard from her daughter since 1995 and has no information regarding her whereabouts.  Sahar's dilemma on the other hand started when her ex-husband, Hussein, was arrested in Zahedan in Sistan and Baluchistan province for smuggling heroin in 1999. He was caught with one kilogram of heroin and was sentenced to eight years in jail. As a desperate single mother with low self-esteem and no education, Sahar struggled to bring up her children on her own. Eventually, just like Layla, she turned to drugs to ease her pain and desperation. She then turned to prostitution to support her drug addiction and to provide for her three very young sons.  Sahar tells me:</p> <blockquote> <p>Due to my own lack of proper education, finance and family support, I was desperate to make some money to provide for my children. I didn't want my children to end up in jail just like their father did. I had no choice but to turn to prostitution and gradually started dealing in drugs to make ends meet. As the punishment for adultery is very severe in Iran, I had no choice but to apply for divorce while my husband was serving his jail sentence. <br> Since smoking hashish did not make any difference to my state of mind, I gradually turned to harder drugs like opium and then to crack and heroin. On many occasions I have been abused while working as a prostitute and dealing in drugs.  The recent sanctions imposed on Iran have caused the cost of food and housing to hit the roof. Regrettably, I had no choice but to pull out my elder son from school, who was on his final year at high school, to start a job in a bakery shop in south Tehran.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are many others in Iran in the same situation as Layla and Sahar, living in daily despair and pain. <br> According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the Iranian government has always tried to curb addiction's huge social costs and has been more supportive of drug treatment than any other government in the Islamic world.  Even with these measures, the rate of addiction and suffering is not decreasing. Despite the supportive stance of the government, having a border with Afghanistan has, of course, not helped the situation. The authorities have set up many drug rehabilitation and prevention programmes all over Iran, especially in Tehran. Congress 60 in central Tehran is one of 600 centres that provide drug treatment across the country with help from government money. As <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/06/27/africa/27addiction.php\">Nazila Fathi has reported</a>, there are also over 1200 additional centers offering methadone, free needles and other services for addicts who are not ready to quit, including food and treatment for HIV and other infections.</p> <p>But whilst the violence in Afghanistan and the devastating effect of food shortages and sanctions continue, and without the government taking further social measures, these programmes will only provide symptomatic relief. <br> In my opinion, the west needs to be aware that its failed war in Afghanistan is making the situation worse for poor and vulnerable people in the region; and just like in Iraq before the invasion of 2003, the current tough sanctions on Iran are not hitting the regime, but the ordinary people.  The Iranian government also needs to have a less ideological approach to the issue of single mothers. It must provide support, social security, free housing and protection for them, rather than treating them like pariahs or criminals. Unfortunately, women in Iran, like many other countries in the Islamic world, feel that there is a social stigma that acts as a barrier to seeking help. They need to be reassured that it is OK to come forward, talk about their problems and ask for help. I am sure many of my countrymen would agree with me that there need to be some fundamental changes in men's attitudes to women in general. </p> <p>Another solution would be to help these women to brush up on their education and training, to encourage them to enter the workforce. This would allow them to get themselves and their children out of the vicious cycle of drugs and poverty, which has dogged them since they were young girls themselves. <br> Despite the dreadful experiences of these women over two decades, they remain sensitive and gentle souls, profoundly grateful for an opportunity to talk in safety. Sadly, when people cannot talk safely about such things, remedies for the problem cannot be identified; the silence means that the government cannot know why it is that these programmes thus far have failed to curb the devastating problem of dealing and addiction Iran.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/virginatlantic\">Virgin</a> boss Sir Richard Branson today pledged he would \"wage a major battle\" to block a proposed merger between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/britishairways\">British Airways</a> and American Airlines.</p> <p>Sir Richard said the union between BA and AA would lead to price-fixing and force travel agents to put business their way.</p> <p>He is launching a campaign against the deal, which would involve a combined route network serving 443 destinations in 106 countries with 6,200 daily departures.</p> <p>The slogan \"No Way BA/AA\" will be painted on the side of his company's planes.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme ahead of the campaign launch on the outskirts of Heathrow Airport, Sir Richard said he expected regulators to reject the merger.</p> <p>\"The competition authorities listened to us twice before and rejected the idea of BA and AA working effectively as one airline because they believed it to be anti-competitive,\" Sir Richard said.</p> <p>\"We believe nothing has changed, and we are going to wage a major battle to try to stop the two biggest carriers in the world from effectively working as one carrier, being able to sit down behind closed doors and fix prices and, we believe, damage the smaller competitors on the routes.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The market competitor, massively, is BA. If you then put American Airlines on top you are talking about 65% of the market.</p> <p>\"You then are left with really two competitors to compete with them: Virgin and United.</p> <p>\"And the danger is that BA and American together will be able to go into travel agents and say, 'Look, we have 65% of the market, and 65% of your business is coming our way. Next year we want you to make it 68%, the year after that we want you to make it 71%.\"</p> <p>Similar merger proposals failed in 1997 and 2001.</p> <p>But BA chief executive Willie Walsh said the new deal, which also involves Spanish carrier Iberia, would be good for passengers and good for the aviation industry.</p> <p>And he told the programme the industry had moved on since the introduction of the 'open skies' agreement, freeing up transatlantic routes.</p> <p>Mr Walsh said: \"These arguments are old, they are out of date, it's time to move on.</p> <p>\"We have got a new operating regulatory environment, a new competitive environment - move with the times.\"</p> <p>He added: \"This is an issue that will be assessed by the competition regulators, the experts in this field.

Prices for flights this evening have risen as high as \u00a31,800.</p> <p>The websites of both ATOL and the CAA, meanwhile, crashed this morning under the sheer weight of demand from worried XL customers.

  "<p>Would you believe it? Trust in Britain's national mainstream media is being restored. Well, that's according to a survey by <a href=\"http://www.metrica.net/\">Metrica</a>, the global media analysis and evaluation company. Here's what its latest <a href=\"http://www.metrica.net/Whatwedo/Content2h.htm\">UKPulse survey</a> turned up after polling 13,000 UK adults.</p> <p>Trust in television is up a massive 24% to 70% compared to a year ago. People say they believe what they see and hear on key channels. Radio scores well too, up 12% to 61%. And, wait for it, the national press has improved its rating too, rising by 17% to 43%. </p> <p>By contrast, and this amazes me, the regional press \u2013 running at a 49% trust score a year ago \u2013 has managed only a 1% rise. Regional radio also moved up to 50%, a four-point improvement. </p> <p>The internet in general has gained four percentage points, with 34% now saying they trust its content. But news sites fair much better with a 54% rating, outstripping national papers.</p> <p>Blogs, I'm afraid to say, do not come out well. Only 5% of the respondents said they trusted blogs and online forums did worse still, scoring below 1%.<br> <strong>Claire O'Sullivan</strong>, Metrica's associate director, says: \"While national broadcast media is traditionally credited with being the 'most trust-worthy' media type, an upward surge of 24% is exceptional. As is the 17% for national newspapers, despite the criticism they appear to consistently face.\"</p> <p>She then asks \"the natural question\". Why the sudden and spectacular increases? But she offers no answer beyond observing that the findings \"will prompt some interesting debate\". Or maybe not. </p>",
