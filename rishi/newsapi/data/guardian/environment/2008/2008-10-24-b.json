  "<p>Few tears have been shed for bankers in their City and Canary Wharf towers, the authors of their own downfall - and maybe ours too. And threats that without their bonuses, British bankers would brain-drain to Shanghai or Dubai now ring hollow. \"The catastrophe in financial services has been so complete,\" says Linda Jackson, director of outplacement provider Fairplace.</p> <p>Yet while many workers in other sectors enjoy emotional ties to their places of work, the City marches to a different beat. Those hired, fired, used and abused by the banks and investment houses seem to passively accept their treatment as just part of the deal. Nothing personal. Just another transaction.</p> <p>We talked to three former bankers who have discovered a happier life beyond the City; two graduates who are hoping banking wasn't a career mistake; and a cleaner wondering if his next shift will be his last.</p> <h2> The banker</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338971709\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/10/24/YuenSinibaldi220.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Yuen\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Christine Yuen</strong>, 29, had worked for HSBC since the age of 17 - working her way up from a cashier in Canada to corporate banking account management in Canary Wharf. But in May this year she was made redundant. </p> <p>\"I wasn't passionate about banking; it was a safe job with a pay cheque, a good environment and benefits,\" she says. \"But I knew nothing outside banking so felt my world had fallen apart.\"</p> <p>Yuen had an idea for a lifestyle management business, Zentime Living, but admits she would never have had the courage to quit her job to pursue it. \"But when the door shut on me, I thought, this is it. Out of my savings I've invested \u00a31,000 on legal and accountancy advice and my website. I'm my own boss now and have two contractors.\"</p> <p>Now her target clients are City lawyers or corporate and investment bankers. \"I'm targeting me in my old job!\" she says. \"I felt so swamped with tasks as a corporate banker I had no time for any domestic tasks; you worked 12- to 14-hour days and barely had time even for lunch.\" </p> <p>Zentime, says Yuen, runs errands, organises plumbers and arranges holidays - \"we're like personal assistants or concierges\" - as well as providing admin support for small companies such as boutique hedge funds. </p> <p>\"There are a lot of busy people in the City who are dedicated to their careers and who lack time for their personal agenda. And now they will be even more focused on their jobs, under greater pressure to be productive in this credit crisis.\"</p> <h2>The cleaner</h2> <p>On Monday September 14, <strong>Antonio Diaz-Mengivar</strong> picked up the papers, books and personal effects that Lehman Brothers' sacked workers didn't take away in cardboard boxes.</p> <p>Diaz-Mengivar, 49, has worked at the Lehman Brothers building on Canary Wharf for five years but only begins his day's work in the evening. From Monday to Friday, 9pm to 6am, Diaz-Mengivar and a colleague empty bins and pick up litter on 12 of the building's 31 floors. \"It's a lot of back bending,\" concedes Diaz-Mengivar. \"And we are worried, because we do not know what is happening with our jobs. I have spoken with the security guards and they do not know what is happening either.\"</p> <p>The collapse of Lehman's on Wall Street and at this gunmetal-grey building on Bank Street was the trigger for an \"extraordinary, almost unimaginable, sequence of events\", the governor of the Bank of England said this week. </p> <p>As Diaz-Mengivar leaves work for his second job - a 6.30am to 11.30am shift cleaning a Leicester Square theatre - he is still met by a crush of commuters. But he says he now sees worry in those faces, each wondering if their job will be next. The fundraiser dressed as a chicken at the tube station is finding it tougher to fill his bucket for orphans. Winter has come early to Canary Wharf. </p> <p>Nomura, the Japanese bank that has taken on some of the 1m sq ft rented here by Lehman Brothers, will employ 2,500 of the American bank's 4,500 employees. But Diaz-Mengivar and his 30 colleagues have yet to learn of their fate. They are employed by Lancaster Cleaning Company, which is owned by business services giant Rentokil Initial and provides daily cleaning and maintenance services to Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First Boston and Swiss Re, among others. \"I like my job,\" says Diaz-Mengivar. \"And I am too old to start a new job.\"</p> <p>It's said that, typically, the Lehman Brothers' basic salary was about \u00a360,000 before bonuses. Diaz-Mengivar earns \u00a37.20 an hour. How did he feel watching, on TV at home, the bank's sacked employees leave for the last time? He shrugs his shoulders. \"I felt very sad for them. We all need to work.\"</p> <p>He says he does not know when he will receive his 25p an hour bonus. Lancaster is a \"living wage employer\", but has yet to start paying workers the new \u00a37.45 living wage set by London mayor Boris Johnson. \"I make only enough money to pay rent and buy food,\" says Diaz-Mengivar. \"I need the second job so I can send money to my mother in Madrid.\"</p> <p>Canary Wharf cleaners were among the first to benefit from the living wage campaign. Next week campaigners will target Whitehall. \"If the government can find \u00a350bn to bail out bankers, they can find \u00a35m to pay their own cleaners and security guards a living wage,\" says Neil Jameson of London Citizens.</p> <h2>The private banker</h2> <p><strong>Adam Honey</strong>, 42, was a private banker at Merrill Lynch looking after client relationships with wealthy individuals and their investment portfolios. Just as the dotcom bubble was bursting and stock markets were tumbling, Honey met the firm's New York senior management to be told he was the future of the company. </p> <p>\"I flew back on the Sunday night and on the Monday morning walked into our London office to hear that I'd been made redundant,\" he recalls. \"By 10.10am I was literally out on the street. It's a numbers game, nothing personal.\"</p> <p>Honey says that he was offered a couple of banking jobs \"in the 50 to 100 grand bracket\" and was in a fifth interview for a job in Geneva when the bank chairman interviewing him took a phone call. \"He said, 'I'm sorry but we can't now offer you a position.' When I asked him why, he told me to go back to my hotel and switch on the television.\" The date was September 11, 2001. </p> <p>Deciding that \"I wanted my fate to be in my own hands\", Honey set up Mountain Leap Events to look after businesses entertaining clients on ski weekends. \"I've always been mad about mountain sports, so I was following my passion as well as my contacts.\" He sold his London flat and started out with a second-hand computer in a rented apartment in Chamonix.</p> <p>\"Now we're launching a short residential Alpine retreat for people facing exceptional changes of circumstances - redundancy, health issues, family, whatever. I was fortunate that Merrill Lynch was just a job for me. I live much more modestly than I did nine years ago, but much more happily.\"</p> <h2>The vice-president</h2> <p>For eight years <strong>Jonathan Hesford</strong>, now 43, designed, installed and supported real-time IT trading systems for Merrill Lynch in New York, rising through the ranks to become a vice-president on a nice salary that bought his family a comfortable lifestyle. \"We lived just 500 metres from the World Trade Centre and on September 11 I saw both planes hit and had to run from our apartment with our one-year-old,\" he recalls. \"Merrill Lynch lost so much money in the disaster I was made redundant; my visa was tied to my job so we returned to England, and decided that what had happened was a good catalyst for making a change.\"</p> <p>Confessing to being a \"bit of a wine ponce\", Hesford and his wife dreamed of owning their own vineyard and winery. Hesford studied winemaking in New Zealand, taking a postgraduate diploma in viticulture and oenology, then worked as an assistant winemaker at Neudorf.</p> <p>\"We bought undervalued vineyard land in Roussillon in France, where you can buy old vines, small properties and character vineries - the skeleton of something up-and-running you can renovate. The work is varied with physical activity, outdoors working, the science and the art of it, and running your own business, creating labels and talking to customers. From banking I understand financing; and having been a project manager, I understand planning. Starting with pruning the vines and ending with selling the wine, it's a project cycle.\"</p> <p>At Domaine Treloar, Hesford grows Syrah, Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre and Muscat grape varieties and produces 40,000 bottles a year which are sold locally, in the UK and in Germany. \"We're making a small profit, and that's all I'm looking for. We're building something permanent that can't be taken away - unlike the people in the City right now who are losing their jobs, bonuses, options and lifestyle all in one go. </p> <p>\"Though I miss the cut and thrust of banking, what I do now pays off twice as much as a lifestyle.\"</p> <h2>The graduates</h2> <p>Golden hellos worth thousands, fat bonuses every year, overseas travel, rapid promotion, all expenses paid ... plenty of reasons to consider a career in the City. Well, at least there used to be.</p> <p>With Lehman Brothers gone and job cuts at Citigroup, HSBC and Goldman Sachs, many recent graduates working in the financial services sector are beginning to wonder if they have made the right career choice. Graduate trainees were among those to lose their jobs when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September. \"Some of them had only been there a couple of months before they were laid off,\" says Shuvo Loha, managing director of City headhunting firm Janikin Rooke.</p> <p>\"The atmosphere at work is not positive,\" admits one recent graduate who asked that he and his employer remain anonymous, because \"I don't want to imply that the company is screwed\". </p> <p>Although he still has a job in capital markets at one of the banks in Canary Wharf, he has seen many of his colleagues laid off and is worried about his own future. \"My department has taken a battering, and it's hard to see your colleagues disappear - you spend 14-hours a day with these guys and then they lose their jobs. And it could happen to me. The current crisis has shown me that anyone is dispensable. You stay loyal to your team, but when the shit hits the fan it counts for nothing - if they need to cut back, they'll get rid of you.\"</p> <p>University of Liverpool graduate Faheem (who does not want his surname to be revealed) was made redundant in the summer from an accounting role at a City bank, but he is trying to remain sanguine about the experience. \"It was difficult, but I'm seeing it as a chance to refocus on what I want to do. The job agencies told me that opportunities were drying up, so I thought I'd cut my losses, rent out my London flat and go back to live with my parents while studying for my next set of accountancy exams,\" he says. \"I'm confident that the market will pick up. At the end of the day, it's just a boom-and-bust cycle. That's just how the industry works.\"</p> <p>Many students who were considering a job in banking and finance will be having second thoughts about their plans, yet universities are still promoting City careers on campuses. \"Yes, we are still encouraging students to apply for the banking and finance sector,\" says Gill Frigerio, acting director of careers at the University of Warwick, \"but also to consider a wide range of other options such as consultancy or investment management.\"</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England was under intense pressure</a> last night to cut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">interest rates</a> after new figures showed the economy had contracted for the first time in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">16 years as it heads into recession</a>.</p> <p>The news hammered the FTSE 100 index, which lost as much as 9% of its value at one point, wiping \u00a390bn off the value of leading shares. It also clobbered the pound, which suffered its biggest fall against the dollar since 1992, to below $1.53 - a six-year low. As recently as July, the pound would buy $2, but it has been falling rapidly on evidence that the economy is slumping. The pound also hit a record low against the euro yesterday of just under 82p.</p> <p>Official data showed gross domestic product contracted by 0.5% in the July to September period - a much bigger amount than expected, the first fall since early 1992 and the biggest drop since the fourth quarter of 1990.</p> <p>\"It's a big shock that the decline is so large. It is truly dire,\" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec.</p> <p>Barring a miraculous bounce in the current quarter, the economy will fulfil the technical definition of a recession - two quarters of contraction. Economists expect at least four more quarters of shrinkage in a row, which would be as bad as the recessions of the early 1990s or early 1980s.</p> <p>Alistair Darling, the chancellor, said he was confident the British economy would get through this \"difficult period\" and reaffirmed the government's commitment to help individuals and businesses.</p> <p>\"I've lived through the recessions this country saw in the 1970s, 80s and 90s,\" he said. \"The difference is this time we are determined to do everything we can, and as soon as we can, to help people so that if they lose their jobs they can get back into work, that if businesses get into difficulty we do our level best to help them.\"</p> <p>His words followed an acknowledgment from Gordon Brown and the Bank of England's governor, Mervyn King, this week that recession was inevitable as a result of the global credit crisis and collapsing house prices.</p> <p>George Osborne, shadow chancellor, dubbed it \"a defining moment in the record of Gordon Brown\" and said millions of British families were \"in for a very difficult time in the months ahead\".</p> <p>He added: \"This is the day that we can all see that the central claims he made over 10 years - that he had abolished boom and bust and therefore didn't need to set aside money for a rainy day - have been shown to be completely false.\"</p> <p>The data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the fall in national output was widespread, with only agriculture and government services still growing. Statisticians said the biggest falls were in areas such as financial services and in manufacturing and construction.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, warned the UK was \"on the edge of a new winter of discontent\".</p> <p>He said: \"These growth figures show that the credit crunch is hitting the real economy and harder and faster than was first feared.\"</p> <p>Charles Bean, the Bank's deputy governor, warned that the economic slump was still in its early stages as a result of \"possibly the largest financial crisis of its kind in human history\". He added, though, that he hoped the worst of the crisis was past. But yesterday's figures largely related to the period before the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers in mid-September that led to the financial maelstrom of the past few weeks.</p> <p>Economists said the current quarter and all of 2009 could see falling output and urged the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) to add to this month's half-point rate cut which took the bank rate down to 4.5%.</p> <p>\"My comment to traders was 'dive, dive, dive',\" said Brian Hilliard, economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in London.</p> <p>\"It's a very emphatic entry into recession which underlines the need for very dramatic interest rate cuts which we think the Bank of England will deliver.\"</p> <p>Speculation is growing in the City that the MPC could deliver its biggest ever cut in the interest rate at its next meeting on November 6, reducing it by one percentage point to 3.5%, or that it could hold an emergency meeting next week to cut the rate, such is the gravity of the situation.</p> <p>The TUC's general secretary, Brendan Barber, said: \"Urgent action should start with a cut in interest rates by the Bank to below 3%. The newly unemployed should be given more help by reversing cuts in Jobcentre Plus staff, increasing statutory redundancy pay and lifting the amount of redundancy pay that can be taken tax-free.\"</p>",
  "<p>Credit was already crunching when the cast pulled on their smocks and waistcoats to film Charles Dickens' Little Dorrit but the BBC's drama department cannot possibly have imagined how perfectly this tale of fraudulent financiers and tragic bankrupts would chime with the new hard times. And just as Dickens' honest but burdened hero, Arthur Clennam, is naively oblivious to the economic shenanigans unfolding around him, so too is the man who plays him.</p> <p>Wanting more space for their young family, Matthew Macfadyen and his actress wife, Keeley Hawes, have bought a bigger house in south-west London, which is \"really clever financially\" he observes dryly, just when the economy appears \"on the brink of the global collapse\".</p> <p>\"We thought perhaps our industry won't ... \" He tails off with a hopeful chortle. \"Everyone likes to be told stories as they are being repossessed.\"</p> <p>Little Dorrit, adapted by Andrew Davies, delivers its blend of timely relevance and Victorian escapism over 15 episodes on BBC1 this autumn. Macfadyen is delighted the drama has been given so much screen time. \"They are wonderful gobbets of soap, really. And it comes on after EastEnders, so you get your fix,\" he says.</p> <p>Macfadyen's Arthur, a lonely man in early middle age, returns to Britain after a long exile working in China, troubled by his father's dying words. He senses that his family has committed a great wrong that he must put right. Little Dorrit, a young woman born in a debtors' prison, played by newcomer Claire Foy, works for Arthur's terrifying mother. \"Arthur would never imagine that Little Dorrit would fall for him,\" he says. \"She falls in love with him and he doesn't see it, and that's the love story that goes through the whole piece. It's a wonderful Dickens potboiler, apart from anything else.\"</p> <p>Macfadyen first came to the fore as the taciturn spy Tom Quinn in the highly successful TV series Spooks and made a notable, and equally taciturn, Fitzwilliam Darcy, wooing Keira Knightley in the film of Pride And Prejudice. He is 34, but has noticed the steadily rising age of the parts he is offered: \"John, 40s, grey hair,\" he grins. \"Slightly jowly, tired looking.\"</p> <p>Even as a younger man, his good looks were leavened by something more interesting: an attractive melancholy. Which is perhaps why, in the coming months, he is playing - as well as Arthur - three very different characters, all men bearing burdens rather bigger than a large mortgage.</p> <p>A friend of mine reckons that this solemnity makes Macfadyen look a bit like a Moomin (those Swedish cartoon figures that look like hippopotamuses). Macfadyen has a reputation for being \"notoriously awkward\", as he puts it - this is on the basis of an interview he did shortly before filming Pride And Prejudice, in which he confessed he had not read Jane Austen and defensively dismissed questions about how he would step out of Colin Firth's dripping shadow. So I am surprised when he enthuses about being likened to Tove Jansson's slightly mournful white creatures. \"I like Moomins. I've got these fantastic Moomin mugs and bowls. My little boy examines which bowl I've given him to eat his Weetabix out of,\" he says. \"So that pleases me. Matthew MacMoomin. That's nice.\"</p> <p>Macfadyen actually turns white in Frost/Nixon, the forthcoming film of David Frost's epic TV interrogation of Richard Nixon; he bleached his hair and dons preposterously large spectacles to play a young-but-grey John Birt. It is a comical look - Macfadyen's entrance as the future BBC director general sent enjoyable sniggers around the preview screening I attended - but while Michael Sheen and Frank Langella will probably attract most critical attention for their impersonations of Frost and Nixon, Macfadyen's Birt, then Frost's producer and right-hand man, is subtle, serious and accomplished.</p> <p>Frost/Nixon is adapted from the successful play by Peter Morgan about the 1977 television interview, when Frost was trying to reboot his flagging career and the disgraced former president hoped to redeem his reputation. Macfadyen watched it on Broadway, where he found the dramatisation of Birt \"a bit risible\" - reducing a serious investigative journalist to a \"goofy Brit producer\".</p> <p>\"I don't think Birt was particularly taken with that and nor would you be,\" he says. So before filming began, he met Lord Birt for lunch at the House of Lords. Rather than the actor scrutinising his subject's mannerisms - \"I thought it shouldn't be just an impression,\" says Macfadyen - he ended up being scrutinised himself when Birt visited LA to see the final day's filming. \"He was watching me do him, on a monitor. He was there with a burger. It was very nerve-racking actually.\" He felt \"terribly\" self-conscious; luckily, Birt did not witness the scene where Macfadyen's Birt rushes naked into the ocean to celebrate Frost's interview. Macfadyen blushes. \"Oh Christ, I'd completely forgotten about that. The bum shot.\" Did Birt really do something so seemingly out of character? \"He said to me, 'Well, it's the sort of thing I would've done, I could've done it,' so that was good enough for me.\"</p> <p>Since he's come fresh from a film about the tussle between interviewer and subject, I wonder if Mcfadyen has picked up tips from Tricky Dicky on how to handle tricky questions. In Frost/Nixon, the ex-president throws his inquisitor off balance with abrupt questions about his private life ... \"Done any fornicating lately?\" says Macfadyen with a smile, giving an excellent impression of Langella doing Nixon.</p> <p>Macfadyen himself is more subtle. He has the diffident habit of leaving uncompleted sentences hanging in the air, but he is a charming interviewee, modest, without taking things too seriously. Which might make you hesitate to intrude. On the other hand, some stories are too romantic and intriguing to resist. Nearly seven years ago, so the legend goes, Macfadyen stood on the set of Spooks in the rain and declared his love for co-star Keeley Hawes. Hawes had very recently married her long-term boyfriend, Spencer McCallum, with whom she had a young son.</p> <p>She responded in kind and Macfadyen and Hawes are now married and live with their two young children, Maggie and Ralph, and Mylo, Hawes' son with McCallum. Hawes' ex-husband lives nearby. Tabloid fascination with this calm domesticity reignited earlier this year when it was reported that they all went out as a family and Macfadyen and McCallum even sloped off to the pub together.</p> <p>He looks a little weary when asked about this turn of events. \"There isn't any story. We all get on. It's really aggravating all that. It's really shithead journalism. It's not an unusual thing - families that make it all right for the sake of the kids. The story is that there is no animosity. I never said that we went down the pub.\" He sighs, and points out that none of the family courts attention and he and Hawes don't invite the celebrity magazines into their home. Does the continuing interest rile him? \"It's not annoying, it's fine,\" he says. \"It's irrelevant.\"</p> <p>Two other new film roles see Macfadyen playing policemen. These, too, are roles where emotions are subsumed to duty and responsibility. In Incendiary, Macfadyen plays an antiterrorist police officer and Ewan McGregor's rival in love. McGregor embarks on a torrid affair with a young mother moments before her husband and young son are killed in a terrorist bomb at a football match. Macfadyen is cautious because he hasn't seen the final cut after a long editing process but says it was a \"brilliant script\" based on a wonderful novel by Chris Cleave, which had the misfortune to be published on July 7 2005, the day of the terrorist attacks on London.</p> <p>His other celluloid copper is a police inspector in a new Miss Marple film. \"Marple is like doing posh rep. It's such fun. It's so silly.\" He acted alongside Rupert Graves and kept collapsing into giggles. \"We couldn't get through scenes without corpsing. I can't look at him. We can't really act together. We shouldn't any more because it's very, very difficult.\"</p> <p>Macfadyen does not find it so difficult to act alongside his wife. He turned up in an episode of the hugely popular Ashes To Ashes, where Hawes plays DCI Alex Drake. \"It's really hard when your other half is in it but I thought Ashes To Ashes was so clever and witty and creepy and funny and camp and silly,\" he enthuses. He also played Hawes' screen husband in Frank Oz's Death At A Funeral, which was released last year. Macfadyen is one of the few likable things in the black comedy and I confess that I didn't enjoy it at all. \"No. Yes. Lots of people have really ... \" murmurs Macfadyen. \"People were divided over it. It was a sublimely happy shoot. Hilarious script,\" he shrugs. \"One of those things.\" Later, almost as an aside, he adds: \"I'm equivocal about my performance in a lot of things.\"</p> <p>There is no competitiveness in his household, not when he's playing Prince Hal in Henry IV at the National and not when he and Hawes are developing a burgeoning sideline in voiceover work. He recently provided the grave narration of The Blair Years documentary. \"It's all acting. It's all cobblers,\" he laughs. He attributes his rich and rolling timbre - redolent of Alan Rickman - to smoking. \"It does help. You think of all those rich, fabulous, fruity voices - the Gambons and McKellens - and they are all from years of...\" He tails off again. \"I gave up about four years ago. I still miss it.\" Meanwhile, Hawes does really well on the voiceover work, too: \"She's been doing Lara Croft for the computer game. There's some peculiar fan mail coming through the door.\"</p> <p>How does Macfadyen feel about his fans who have edited highlights of his brooding Mr Darcy into tribute videos backed by power ballads on YouTube? \"I feel very flattered. I don't know, really.\" Do you get people wanting to mother you? Because you have quite a sad face, I say. He giggles. \"Vulnerable, yeah. It's just weird. It's really peculiar. Because the lovely thing about being an actor is being anonymous, it's never having to explain yourself. And that's what I find interesting about actors or painters I admire. I don't want to know about their lives. I don't really want to know what Anthony Hopkins has for breakfast. It's kind of bollocks, isn't it?\"</p> <p>Soon, no doubt, Macfadyen will pop up in YouTube clips as a naked John Birt, frolicking in the ocean. Is that as far as his career nudity will go? \"Who knows? The websites will have a field day, won't they?\" He hopes the scene will be set to a very stirring, cheesy - and not at all melancholy - rock power ballad. \"Europe! The Final Countdown!\" he laughs.</p> <p>\u2022 Little Dorrit starts tomorrow on BBC 1 at 8pm. The second episode is next Thursday.</p>",
  "<p>It is a weekday afternoon in Moscow's most luxurious shopping arcade. In the Dolce &amp; Gabbana store - with its chandeliers, black mirror walls and stainless steel D&amp;G logo - a young man is trying on a leather jacket. \"It's known as the David Beckham,\" a shop assistant explains helpfully. The jacket, lined with racoon fur, costs a mere \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,000). \"We've sold two in the past week,\" he adds - proof, it seems, that the global financial crisis has so far not daunted Russian capitalism.</p> <p>Next door, down a pretty cobbled street, it's business as usual in the Bentley showroom. Here you can pick up an apricot-coloured Bentley convertible for \u00a3240,000. Further down the road - and moving away from Moscow's grim, grey KGB headquarters, the Lubyanka - is Tsum, another luxury department store. In the food hall there is caviar and champagne; upstairs you can buy a designer lilac dog-warmer for your chihuahua. The price? 8,999 roubles (\u00a3200).</p> <p>And yet something strange is happening in Russia - the country that invented the word oligarch back in the 1990s to define a new kind of state-connected entrepreneur. Nobody quite agrees what exactly oligarch means; these days it has become a loose synonym for Russia's super-rich. But in the new post-credit-crisis world everyone can concur on one thing - that Russia's oligarchs are in trouble. </p> <p>Over the past five months, according to the financial news agency Bloomberg, Russia's wealthiest 25 individuals have collectively lost $230bn (\u00a3146bn). Tycoons like Oleg Deripaska - Russia's richest man and friend, we now know, of British politicians - have seen their fortunes vaporised. On paper, Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea FC owner, has suffered a $20.3bn wipeout. Alisher Usmanov, the Arsenal shareholder-tycoon has lost $11.7bn, Bloomberg estimates. </p> <p>Analysts say that private jets could soon be going for bargain basement prices, while some super-rich are scrambling to sell off their villas in Sardinia and Surrey. In Moscow, elite nightclubs have relaxed their strict entry rules - there aren't enough customers. The capital's top restaurants, meanwhile, have stopped accepting credit cards.</p> <p>Not that Russia's oligarchs are in the mood for entertaining. Since hosting Peter Mandelson and George Osborne on his yacht in Corfu this August, Deripaska has slithered into a classic Westminster political scandal. The aluminium magnate's British-related woes do not stop there: a former business partner, Michael Cherney, is suing him for $4bn in the high court. Rumours suggest he's even been forced to lay off his servants. A spokesman said Deripaska does not comment on private matters.</p> <p>The twilight of the oligarchs is closely linked to the meltdown in Russia's stock market. Since May, Russia's RTS index has lost 71% of its value. It is no secret that Deripaska borrowed money from western banks using shares in his companies as collateral. The share price crashed; the banks then asked for their cash back. Deripaska is now in danger of being sucked into a black hole of debt. Others have money stuck in Iceland.</p> <p>Is, then, the era of the oligarch now over? Not everyone agrees with this thesis. But it does seem that Russia's rich are experiencing a moment of historical catharsis. After a giddy decade characterised by the acquisition of yachts, football teams, villas in Kensington, west London and the South of France, and even submarines, there is a distinct sense that Russia is moving into a different, more chastened, epoch. </p> <p>\"My stocks were worth $1bn. They're now worth $300m. OK. So what?\" says billionaire Alexander Lebedev, sitting on a brown leather sofa in his comfortable three-storey Moscow townhouse. Lebedev, a Russian businessman and former KGB agent unkindly nicknamed the spy who came in for the gold, is unperturbed by his loss of fortune. Until recently, he had $3.1bn - and was 39th on Forbes' list of Russia's top 100 billionaires. \"It doesn't make any difference to my life,\" he says.</p> <p>Lebedev is also a former deputy in the Duma and a member of Russia's beleaguered intelligentsia. He says he has survived the crisis that has been aggravated by Russia's war in Georgia better than many of his peers. They took generous loans from Russian banks, bought shares, and then took out more loans from western banks against the value of these shares - a pyramidal arrangement that is now collapsing. </p> <p>Asked how Russia's oligarchs are bearing up, Lebedev is almost puckishly cheerful. He says: \"They are suffering.\" He adds: \"I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption.\"</p> <p>Lebedev is a patron of the arts and last week met Tom Stoppard, John Malkovich, and Kevin Spacey to discuss a new Chekhov festival in Crimea, Ukraine. In general, he is scathing of oligarchs as a class - describing them as a bunch of uncultured ignoramuses. \"They don't read books. They don't have time. They don't go to exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht,\" he observes.</p> <p>Does he think the crisis might make Russia's elite reconsider their arguably solipsistic lifestyle and values? Lebedev thinks not. \"[Friedrich] Nietzsche once said that when something doesn't kill you it makes you stronger. But it isn't applicable in this case,\" he says. Most oligarchs were not very interested in social injustice, he points out.</p> <p>This spring Forbes magazine estimated that Russia has 110 billionaires - a record. The top 100 had a combined wealth of $522bn - almost four times higher than in 2004, it said. (At the same time 18.9 million Russians live below the poverty line, federal statistics suggest.) According to Lebedev, some members of this exclusive list - known as the golden 100 - are now down to their last $100m, the \u00fcber-rich equivalent of skid row. \"Worst hit are the property developers,\" he says. </p> <p>But in these troubled times analysts suggest that those more likely to feel the pain are Russia's second-tier rich - the country's 150,000 to 200,000 or so millionaires, who have acquired their wealth on the back of Russia's unprecedented economic growth under eight years of Vladimir Putin. Tasteless bling - or pafos to give it its Russian name - is likely to be frowned upon in the new, austere post-crisis era, they add. </p> <p>\"One of the legacies of this is that it will be unacceptable for Russians who have money to throw it around in the way they did before this crisis,\" suggests Chris Weafer, an analyst with the Moscow-based brokerage UralSib. \"People won't have it any more. Or they will consider it unwise to display it,\" Weafer says. Inevitably, the amount of Russian money '\"loshing around\" the west end of London will diminish, he adds. </p> <p>One Londoner, who sources properties for Russian buyers and did not want to be named, said there had been an exodus by Russian businessmen from London in recent weeks. \"A lot have gone home to fight [financial] fires due to the plunge in the Moscow stock market,\" he said.</p> <p>But Elena Norton, who runs the Russian desk for London estate agent, Knight Frank, said there had been more activity from Moscow-based buyers: \"I have seen an increase in the market. Potential buyers all read the newspapers and they know there has been a correction in London house prices and they seem keen to take advantage of that.\"</p> <p>Others think that the big losers will not be London's flashy sushi bars but Russian's struggling lower classes. \"If my net worth is $10bn and it then falls to $1bn it is still probably unlikely that I will have to go out to the bread line tomorrow. So these oligarchs will still be quite well off. But that doesn't mean Russia will be unaffected. What we should look at is how all of this will affect the blue-collar or lower-income classes,\" says Marshall Goldman, a Russia scholar at Harvard University.</p> <p>So far it's not clear what impact the crisis will have on Russia's love affair with consumer spending. Last year Muscovites spent $5bn on luxury goods - $1bn more than New York. At Tretyakovsky Passage - Moscow's boutique-lined shopping street - the number of customers appears to have dipped, though not by much. </p> <p>Outside Gucci, a driver kipped yesterday in a black seven-series Mercedes; nearby someone had parked their giant Hummer jeep on the pavement. </p> <p>The Dolce &amp; Gabbana store had just reopened after a refit; upstairs, near the colourful handbags and \u00a3400 platforms, a black-suited waiter hovered with champagne glasses. The store had new VIP rooms for exclusive clients, fashion director Vincent Francis said, adding that he was confident the latest range of \"short, sexy\" party frocks - costing \u20ac3,000 to \u20ac10,000 each - would fly off the rails before Christmas.</p> <p>For a few, then, Russia's wild capitalist party isn't quite over yet. \"I'm not worried about it. I have my husband to worry about that,\" said Tatyana Nekrasova, 24, her blonde hair tied into a neat bun, as she emerged from Gucci clutching an 11,000-rouble shirt. She admitted, however: \"I have a lot of friends who have investments. They've lost them. They're in a state of shock.\"</p> <p>Next month Moscow hosts its annual Millionaire Fair - a four-day extravaganza of diamond-encrusted mobile phones and other examples of bad taste. Other items on sale include Gulfstream jets, space-age pianos, and mahogany-panelled yachts, which might appeal to Peter Mandelson. Yesterday the fair's organiser Yves Gijrath, a Dutch entrepreneur, said he was optimistic the show, held in a giant exhibition hall outside the capital, would be popular again this year.</p> <p>Russia was not the first country to suddenly acquire wealth and a newly moneyed elite, he said. \"It's the same historical situation for any new economy,\" he said, pointing to the US in the 1950s, Saudi Arabia in the 1970s and Japan in the 1990s. The world's economy was \"elastic\" and would recover, he predicted, adding: \"In its entire history the world has never been as rich as in 2008. There's enough money to go round. The problem is trust.\" </p> <p>Paradoxically, Russia's often-surreal ride from communism to capitalism appears to be going full circle. Under Boris Yeltsin a small, favoured group of businessmen was allowed to acquire the country's newly privatised assets at auctions for a fraction of their real value. Last week Putin offered a $50bn state loan to Deripaska, and other cash-strapped oligarchs, struggling to pay back debts to the west. In effect, the Kremlin is poised to renationalise many of Russia's strategic industries.</p> <p>Nobody is in any doubt as to what befalls oligarchs who disobey the Kremlin. In 2003 Putin arrested Russia's then richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and broke up his Yukos oil empire. Khodorkovsky was convicted of tax evasion; his real crime was to seek to influence politics and to challenge the president. The former tycoon is serving eight years in a Siberian jail and was recently placed in solitary for not sewing properly.</p> <p>Russia's oligarchs, of course, deny that they are in a financial hole. Abramovich's aides insist his $20bn losses are fictitious rather than real, since he doesn't intend to sell his shares in mining and gold. Usmanov, a football nut who owns 24% of Arsenal FC, cast his troubles in a more lyrical vein. Asked whether he might be tempted to sell Arsenal, he told the Guardian last week: \"My love for Arsenal is like that of a man for a woman. It is not something you can sell.\" </p> <p><strong>Additional reporting by Terry Macallister</strong></p>",

  "<p>Kwadoi Marbiah graduated this summer from De Montfort University with a degree in marketing management. \"I have really enjoyed studying marketing since I did my A-levels,\" she explains. \"I think it's dynamic and fast-paced.\"</p> <p>During her degree, Marbiah took a one-year work placement at a credit union, which she believes has given her valuable work experience. \"I enjoyed it thoroughly,\" she says. \"I thought it was going to be just a typical work placement - just making tea and coffee. But I was actually given a lot of responsibility.\"</p> <p>She's now looking to apply her talents to a career in conferences and event management. \"It seems like there would be a lot of variety in that sector,\" she says, \"which is what I'm looking for. And I'd like a job with an international aspect to it, that would allow me to travel.\"</p> <p>We asked Claire Gapper, event producer at Maverick Events Worldwide, to mock interview Marbiah for an entry-level job. Then we asked her what she thought.</p> <p>\"We work on everything from product launches to conferences to brand experiences and integrated campaigns,\" explains Gapper. \"We are also experts in internal communications and about half our work is internal events.\" About 80% of Maverick's work is global, estimates Gapper, with events taking place worldwide.</p> <p>The company prides itself on being able to provide clients with unusual events. \"We try not to offer the standard 'conference room in a hotel' solution,\" says Gapper. \"A lot of people assume that a hotel ballroom is the only option for a conference but we say that they don't have to settle for that.\"</p> <p>As a result, a degree of imagination and creativity is useful. \"It's mainly about absorbing information,\" says Gapper. \"Reading magazines, picking up ideas and storing them, whether it's from interior design, or a new restaurant you're at. You also need the ability to explore and research.\"</p> <p>She adds that the industry is not as glamorous as it might appear. \"People say, 'You must go to lovely parties!' but it's not really like that.\" And she reckons that the main skill involved is being \"overly organised. If somebody asks you where something is, you need to know.\"</p> <p>But above all else, personality counts. \"We find that you can learn on the job, and there's a great support network here. You need a can-do attitude, an ability to muck in and get your hands dirty, be able to manage your time, be efficient and willing to work long hours when necessary, keep a cool head and be able to communicate well.\"</p> <p>On the personality stakes, Marbiah scored highly. \"She was lovely,\" says Gapper. \"She had a wonderful confidence without being arrogant, and she made it clear that she was keen to learn - which is what we look for.\"</p> <p>The experience she gained on her year out from university also stood her in good stead. \"I can definitely see the difference in people who have had work experience, because they learn what's expected from employers in a corporate role,\" says Gapper. </p> <p>Gapper's advice to Marbiah is to make more of her relevant experience. \"Her CV is very strong on her marketing background, which is good to see,\" she says, \"but people in this industry will be looking for some events experience too. Kwadoi has been helping a friend set up an events agency and it sounds like she's been doing quite a lot. She should absolutely promote that.\"</p> <p>Marbiah felt that the interview went well. \"It's a nice company, and Claire was lovely,\" she says. \"I am usually quite relaxed in interviews anyway but that helped and I think I was able to give good answers.\"</p> <p>Gapping agrees. \"She was very smart and eloquent, she'd done research on the company and she came across really well.

  "<p>For Andy Farrell life has turned full circle. When he was 16 he joined a dressing room at Wigan's Central Park that included some of the great players in rugby league's modern era. Ellery Hanley, Martin Offiah, Shaun Edwards and Dean Bell were part of a legendary club side and they were not going to mollycoddle a self-confessed \"cocky\" teenager.</p> <p>Farrell, who had already played in the Wigan second team as a schoolboy, remembers: \"They were a ruthless group who were prepared to help the youngsters but they weren't soft on them. It was a real eye-opener for me. And that's what we want to build at this club.\"</p> <p>The new joint captain of Saracens with the England skipper, Steve Borthwick, looks around the canteen at the University of Hertfordshire where his team-mates are packing away the protein in preparation for tomorrow afternoon's EDF Energy Cup encounter with Northampton at Watford. Having recovered from a dislocated thumb Farrell will be leading the side at Vicarage Road alongside the prodigiously talented young centre Adam Powell. But at some stage this season the 33-year-old Farrell is destined to play alongside another young player and make a little bit of rugby history.</p> <p>Never mind that thumb, though. Fingers should be crossed. In August the 16-year-old Owen Farrell, also a centre, was named on the bench for a pre-season game in St Albans against the touring Western Storm. The schoolboy making waves in Hertfordshire was at some stage to play alongside his dad. Except it did not happen that way. \"The match was a couple of minutes old when I did this,\" says Farrell Sr with a grin, pointing to his dodgy digit. \"I had to leave the field and Owen was still in the toilet when he was called on to replace me. We didn't even cross on the field so I could wish him luck.\"</p> <p>Owen Farrell has since made his debut for the first team. At Vicarage Road three weekends ago he came on as a second-half substitute against a Scarlets team packed with internationals in Saracens' first EDF game. Dad and mum Colleen were proud spectators with Andy quickly bringing his son down to earth. \"He's still got to do his homework tonight and go to school in the morning,\" was his father's blunt assessment after Owen, at 17 years and 11 days, had become the youngest player to play professional rugby for an English club.</p> <p>\"Owen always says I am too hard on him,\" said Farrell. \"But there was nothing better for me as a cocky youngster than to be given advice by the older players. We have eight or nine players here now who are the future of the club and Eddie Jones and the senior players drive them on. The likes of Adam Powell, Alex Goode and Noah Cato are very talented and behind them there is another crop coming through. It's no good having stars at the club if they are out of reach and I and the senior players are helping the youngsters. Perhaps that has not happened enough in the past but we can't just work as a group of individuals and Eddie has helped change the culture of this place in just a few months.</p> <p>\"It's hard for these young players. They have gone from being the top in their peer group to a really harsh environment and playing professional rugby is not easy. It is a test of character. Owen is really serious about his rugby and, yes, it was magnificent to see him play in the first team. But I can't say I enjoyed that 20 minutes. I was like any other parent, just willing him not to make a mistake.\"</p> <p>If Owen Farrell seems to have been genetically programmed to play rugby union for England, Andy Farrell's path to pulling on the red-rose jersey had not exactly been a primrose one. Farrell famously followed his stellar rise to the Wigan first team at 16 by playing for Great Britain at 18 and captaining his country three years later. His decision in March 2005 to move south to play for Saracens in a deal underwritten by Twickenham was a controversial one. Less than two years later he made his England debut at inside-centre alongside Jonny Wilkinson at Twickenham and Scotland had no answer to that muscular midfield combination. But a foot injury and back injury and an early row between club and country over what position he should play has helped make the switch of codes fraught.</p> <p>Andy Farrell, who watched Owen play for the England 18 Group last night, will switch on his television at home in Harpenden this morning and watch England's first game of the rugby league World Cup with interest. His England rugby union days may be over but he has no regrets about his move south. \"I don't regret the change at all. It's been fantastic and we want to win at least one trophy this season. We can because standards here have gone through the roof.\"</p> <p>This week there was some shocking news from the north for Farrell to absorb. David Myers, killed in a car accident on the M6 in Cheshire on Monday night, was an early team-mate at Wigan. \"I still can't believe it. David was a big-money signing from Widnes. He was mischievous and had a great sense of fun. In his heyday he was one of the great wingers and was scoring tries for fun. It was a real shock to hear the news.\" If nothing else it put coping with a painful thumb into perspective.</p>",
  "<p>There are numerous books that promise to help you \"think like a genius\", or like Einstein, or even - if Einstein isn't good enough - How To Think Like History's 10 Most Revolutionary Minds. But they're beset with problems. Some try to teach a \"secret formula\", even though following someone else's five-step system is surely antithetical to genius. Some confuse correlation with causation: Thomas Jefferson was an early riser, and he basically invented the US, so you should get up early, too! Others are plain odd. In How To Think Like Leonardo Da Vinci, Michael Gelb recommends doing an \"ambiguity dance\" to express feelings about uncertainty. I can't imagine Leonardo doing an ambiguity dance. Though if he had done, maybe he'd have come up with a flying machine that actually worked, the loser.</p> <p>\"Genius\" is a slippery word, anyway. The American neuroscientist Gregory Berns uses a different term as the title of his new book on thinking differently: Iconoclast. Looking at original thinking as \"iconoclastic\" - as disruptive of the usual ways we're conditioned to see the world - turns out to be much more useful. It may even help you think a bit more like Leonardo. </p> <p>Berns' starting point is that the brain \"is fundamentally a lazy piece of meat\": it needs energy to operate, and has evolved to use it as efficiently as possible. So when it perceives the outside world, or imagines things, the average brain uses as many short cuts as it can - past experience, other people's opinions - to avoid the taxing effort of perceiving or imagining afresh. It's literally harder work to perceive what you're not expecting to perceive, which is why airport security screeners who watch thousands of harmless bags roll by will at times fail to notice even a very prominent gun. To test the brain's laziness for yourself, Berns suggests, close your eyes and imagine the sun setting on a beach: the image is such a clich\u00e9 that it's tough to visualise it except in vague and clich\u00e9d form. (Now see what happens if you imagine a sunset on Pluto.) One solution is to \"bombard the brain with things it has never encountered before\", to deny it the opportunity to use short cuts - by travelling, meeting new people, working in a different environment, or reading about unfamiliar subjects. </p> <p>But there's another barrier to iconoclastic thinking: fear. Once you've jolted your brain on to a new path of thought, pursuing it further - either in your head or by acting on it - will stimulate the fear of uncertainty, failure or disapproval. I've often wondered if this is why many people get their best ideas in the shower, or why I get them on trains and planes - contexts where you can't physically put an idea into practice and so, for the time being, can't fail, either. Iconoclasts find ways to coexist with their fears, Berns says. It's by learning that skill, and by actively seeking unfamiliar experience, that we non-iconoclasts can emulate them. Ambiguity dances? Not so much.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>In 1997 when Labour came to power I was 19 and in my first year at university. The day after the election, my mum came to visit. \"I can't wait to have sex under a Labour government again,\" she informed my friends, gleefully watching me redden. This was typical of my mum. She has always loved embarrassing me and what better way of doing so than talking about her sex life? </p> <p>Over the years I've endured this situation in many different forms, but always with the same ultimate outcome: humiliation for me. So when the anecdotes seemed to dry up about five years ago, I was initially relieved. But today I am on a mission to bring back the embarrassing stories. Why? Because I believe that their absence is a sign that my mum has given up on finding love or romance - and at 54, she's nowhere near past it. Some might say it's not a daughter's place to take over her mother's love life, but that's exactly what I plan to do. </p> <p>We are quite different, my mum and I. At 31, I've long accepted that my parents are wilder and more rebellious than I'll ever be. My mum spent her 20s squatting in empty London homes; I have never missed a mortgage payment. By 16, my mum had been kicked out of her home and her school; I rebelled by attending Sunday school. My mum believes in free love; I believe in soul mates. I'm not quite as pure as Saffy and she's not as sozzled as Edina, but it's by no means a preposterous comparison. </p> <p>So perhaps it's no surprise that we have different ideas about what love means. My mum has never aspired to one enduring relationship, and the picture of two people growing old together leaves her cold. For me, I can think of nothing better than sharing my life and bringing up a family with one person. </p> <p>When I was growing up she had many boyfriends. I always liked them - she has good taste in men. My favourite was the psychologist who analysed dreams - even having a 15-year-old's incoherent ramblings every morning didn't put him off. But my mum could never tolerate them for very long. Usually they would make the mistake of asking her to step up her level of commitment and she would realise that she didn't want to. So from a very young age I worried about what would happen to my mum as she grew old. As young as seven or eight I would fret about her being alone. I used to pester her to get pregnant. Couldn't she and my dad \"do it\" just one more time? As an only child I was interested in having someone else around, but I also had a sense that enlarging our family would mean that someone would share the worry-load with me, relieve me of my burden. But while my parents would do anything for me, they wouldn't do that. </p> <p>So here we are, 20 years on: she is still single and I am still worried. Luckily I have a plan - to come to the rescue and help find her a boyfriend. The trouble is, she doesn't think she needs my \"help\". She says she's not interested in sharing her life with someone else. She has a great circle of friends (none of whom has ever married either) who provide all the stimulation, support and companionship she needs. A boyfriend would get on her nerves. </p> <p>Because we have a somewhat tempestuous relationship (she thinks I am bossy, sneering and supercilious; I think she is unreasonable, argumentative and usually wrong), I decide to take her for a day out to a spa to reveal my plan. I'm hoping that the relaxing, hushed environment will keep any rising arguments at bay. I want to challenge her stance on love and long-term relationships and get to the bottom of how she really feels. As we lounge by the pool in our comfy dressing gowns, I put it to her that perhaps her attitude is self-preservation, a case of once bitten, twice shy? </p> <p>\"Yes, it's all your dad's fault,\" she laughs. She is joking, but I wonder if there is some truth to this. My mum was in her early 20s when she separated from my father, and the scars ran deep. I was less than a year old when he left and she was suddenly and unexpectedly alone. Although they never married (my mum finds the idea of one man \"giving\" her to another abhorrent, but you guessed that already, didn't you?), I wonder if she had planned to spend her life with him? She concedes she had. So I want to know what has changed from the 23-year-old Diane who wanted to spend the rest of her life with my dad to the 54-year-old Diane who thinks that a man would just get in her way? She is unable to answer.</p> <p>I ask why none of her boyfriends lasted, when as far as I could tell, they were really nice blokes. \"That's just it,\" she says, \"I can't stand men who fawn all over me.\" Could it be, I suggest, that her rejection of these men is simply because \"love\" has never worked for her? And this is where, as we bubble in the Jacuzzi, we get to the crux of it: of course, she would like a hugely fulfilling relationship, she just doesn't believe a relationship could ever be hugely fulfilling. I am determined to convince her otherwise and she agrees - finally - to sign up with the online dating agency Match.com. </p> <p>She is fairly flexible over her requirements in a man, but puts her foot down on two counts: any possibles must be university-educated and not want children. That night at home I fill in her details. Five pages of supposedly suitable men appear. I start to flick through their profiles. I am immediately struck by the number of men, in their 50s or 60s, looking for women in their 30s and 40s. Why don't these men want someone their own age? Are they so immature that they have to look to someone 20 years younger for intellectual stimulation? </p> <p>I search through the supposedly suitably matched males and start \"winking\" at people. It's not a real wink, of course, but an electronic one. A quick and easy way of letting someone know you think they look all right and nudging them towards your own profile. I wink at eight people, including a journalist; a health and safety officer who likes Joni Mitchell; a man with a delicious looking pad in the French Alps; and a guy who lists his grandchildren as one of his interests. Then I sit back and wait. </p> <p>Suddenly, I am nervous. What if none of them responds? What if they say she is too old or too fat or some other horrible insult? I can't cope with the responsibility - she will be upset and it will be my fault. I keep checking back compulsively every couple of minutes, I have a cycle going: Facebook, Gmail, Match.com, Facebook, Gmail, Match.com ... A reply! And he sounds nice - he says he's intelligent, likes cooking and listens to the Arctic Monkeys. Excitedly, I sit Mum down at the computer to see the men I have chosen for her, particularly the Replier. </p> <p>\"Oh no, he looks far too much like Terry, I couldn't date him,\" she shrieks. Terry was the boyfriend she left for my father, aged 19. </p> <p>The trouble is, it is Terry. I have unwittingly winked at one of my mother's ex-boyfriends. Of the four million people on Match.com, I have chosen one of mum's exes. You couldn't make this up. Perhaps she would consider rekindling that relationship - 39 years is a long time, after all. She is not impressed. Nor is she impressed with the other guys I have winked at. Men are discarded for bad spelling, wanting to hold hands, believing in God and living in Milton Keynes. \"Really, Rachel, this one refers to women as ladies, what were you thinking?\" </p> <p>It may not be the most positive start to our search, but I can see her interest is piqued ... and that's what matters. </p> <p>Over the next few days the winks keep coming and even a couple of emails. I'm amused by the names that people give their dating profiles. Unfortunately, I can't share their real names for privacy reasons. Let's just say the word \"luv\" is very popular, as are numbers in the place of words, as in \"Looking4luv786\" and \"GonnaLuvU4ever\". The ones that really made me squirm were the ones with a sexual undertone, as in \"SoftTouchStroke\" or \"MoistlipsWaitin4U\". Yuck. Just finding a bloke whose name doesn't sound like a 15-year-old girl's text message is a task in itself. </p> <p>So CamdenMan has already won me over when he gets in touch. His email is polite and friendly; he thanks Mum for the wink and suggests that they chat by email. It's all very civilised and I'm pretty sure he's not an ex. Over the next few days they have a couple of chats by email and Mum seems keen. This is excellent, but I feel that she should play the internet field and not put all her eggs in one basket, so to speak. </p> <p>I needn't have worried. Not only is she multi-electronic dating, but also the embarrassing comments are back. \"I'd shag Teddy Sheringham,\" she informs me as we watch Soccer Aid. \"But I wouldn't be able to have a conversation with him.\" (Sorry, Teddy, if you are reading this). She'd also \"shag\" her electrician, George Clooney and David Miliband (and his brother, though not at the same time). </p> <p>A week later, Mum has already had to dump one of her e-boyfriends before they have even met. He suggested that she wouldn't be able to cope with his flirty nature, which turned out to be a sackable offence. Not because she doesn't like flirts, she is just suspicious of self-confessed flirts who think that flirting involves saying ridiculous things like that. But she's not fazed, there are plenty more where he came from. She's gone wink-tastic and is in regular contact with at least two guys with potential. Plus, CamdenMan has suggested meeting up. A bona fide date! </p> <p>If it were down to my mum, there would be no preparation and she would probably be late. But I'm in charge here. First, a new outfit. My mum believes that you should never spend more than you did in 1972 on any one item of clothing, so it takes a lot of persuasion to even get her into Marks &amp; Spencer. But it's worth it. We - well, I - choose the perfect get-up - effortless chic, I like to think. At the hairdresser she manages to embarrass me again by telling everybody that her daughter is \"pimping\" her out. She draws the line at waxing, but does consent to an eyelash tint. I know that appearances aren't important (yadda, yadda, yadda), but also that first impressions count. </p> <p>CamdenMan and TottenhamGirl arrange to meet for coffee on the South Bank. I must take a step back and let her get on with it. As much as I would like to go along, sit at the next table wearing dark glasses, it's not appropriate. This is, after all, a private affair. I don't expect that this guy will be her Mr Right, but I hope that she'll have fun. I hope it will spark her interest and persuade her that the quest for love is worth sticking with. Maybe she does know herself better than I do. Maybe her \"Golden Girls\" group of friends is more than enough for her. But I'm happy just to have got her thinking about love again. </p> <p>The evening after the date I can't resist calling to see how it went. \"Mind your own business,\" she says. Must have been good, then.</p>",
  "<p>The stricken US regional bank National City Corporation succumbed yesterday to a $5.6bn (\u00a33.5bn) buyout by its rival PNC after suffering a slide in investor confidence over its exposure to toxic mortgages.</p> <p>National City is based in the Ohio city of Cleveland, where the housing market has been badly affected by the American sub-prime home loans crisis. The bank has suffered losses over five consecutive quarters, culminating in a $729m deficit announced this week.</p> <p>Under the terms of the deal, PNC is paying $2.23 a share for National City, which began the year with a stock price of more than $16. </p> <p>The transaction is the latest in a series of buyouts of loss-making high-street banks, including those affecting Wachovia and Washington Mutual.</p> <p>Founded in 1845, National City is a familiar name throughout the American midwest. It employs 29,000 people. A combination with the Pittsburgh-based PNC will create a bank ranking fifth in the US by deposits, and fourth by branches. Both sides characterised the deal as a strategic fit, rather than a fire sale. </p> <p>Peter Raskind, National City's chairman, said: \"This transaction is about two companies that fit well together in terms of geography, products and services.\"</p> <p>But there is little doubt that National City faces significant financial challenges, largely arising from a former mortgage subsidiary named First Financial. Earlier in the week Raskind admitted that the economic environment had remained tough: \"It probably gets worse before it gets better.\"</p> <p>PNC, meanwhile, revealed that it intended to take advantage of the US treasury's programme of investments in banking shares. It is selling $7.7bn worth of stock and warrants to the government to bolster its balance sheet.</p> <p>Analysts welcomed National City's takeover. David Havens, a credit desk analyst at UBS, told Bloomberg News: \"It certainly beats having these troubled banks end up being taken over by the government.\"</p>",
  "<p>Glenrothes can be reached directly and quickly from Edinburgh by a series of straight dual carriageways, but on Wednesday I took the traditional and more tentative approach through the old mining settlements that followed the Fife coal seam east towards the sea. A hundred years ago these were boom towns, and until the 1960s wages kept the cooperative stores and bars of their long main streets busy with customers. Things are quieter now. </p> <p>At Bowhill, I stopped at the post office and asked the two women behind the counter if we were inside the Glenrothes constituency. Neither knew. In a baker's shop, the young assistant had no idea but her older colleague thought it might be - she'd heard some talk of an election. \"I can never be bothered to vote,\" the younger woman said. \"That's terrible, you should be ashamed of yourself,\" said the older. \"Aye, I know. I'm always being told how women had to struggle to get the vote and that.\" \"Not just women,\" the older said. \"The whole working class! They had to fight for it.\" </p> <p>There was more certain news inside the Bowhill Miners' Welfare Institute (now the Bowhill Community Learning and Development Centre), where a welcoming woman said she thought the parliamentary boundaries of Glenrothes must include Bowhill because the building was to become a polling station on November 6. Then she showed me the little museum dedicated to the memory of John Thomson, who worked at the pit here before he became Glasgow Celtic's goalkeeper, to be knocked dead in a goalmouth collision with a Rangers forward in 1931. </p> <p>Thomson also played for Scotland and he was only 22 when he died. Bowhill has seen no bigger moment. A special train brought mourners to his funeral, where what a contemporary account described as \"the world's press\" had assembled \"to see sights that even the tragic history of the Fife coalfield would find hard to parallel\". </p> <p>None of us knew it but at that very moment the second-largest assembly of the world's press ever seen in the locality was gathered half a mile away on a council estate in Cardenden. According to a report in the Scotsman, Mrs Sarah Brown was followed by three TV crews, seven photographers and a dozen reporters on her \"private\" visit to a few Labour-supporting families. But as there would be so little electoral point in a genuinely private visit, the prime minister's wife needed to be seen being private. The BBC and the Press Association had been exclusively informed, and then the news had leaked. All Mrs Brown would say was that she was there to support the Labour candidate, Lindsay Roy, who is the head of her husband's old school, Kirkcaldy High, and her husband's choice.</p> <p>The hypocrisy is too obvious, and yet one shouldn't be too fierce about it. Publicity for Mrs Brown probably benefits all eight candidates, in the sense that it tells the electorate that a byelection in which they can vote is soon to take place. At the general election in 2005, the turnout in Glenrothes was 56% and only the most stubborn optimist would predict a rise greater than 5% or 6% more next month. This week David Cameron, Charles Kennedy, James Purnell and Alex Salmond all came and went. Journalists turned out in large numbers and asked questions about George Osborne. The people of Glenrothes remained otherwise engaged. In a way, it was like watching muleteers with feathers trying to tickle a prostrate donkey back to life. </p> <p>The conventional wisdom about Glenrothes goes like this. After its victory in Glasgow East, the Scottish National party thought it could wipe out Labour's 10,000-majority. Then the global crisis erupted. Small-country nationalism no longer looked so clever - Salmond will never praise Iceland again. The UK Treasury bailed out Scotland's two greatest banks and Brown emerged as the saviour of the world economy. An SNP victory is no longer secure. There's a new spring in Labour's step. </p> <p>All may be broadly true; people will mention it when asked, though usually only as a kind of hearsay opinion. The world beyond might like to see Glenrothes as referendum on 11 years of Labour government, on Brown's recent heroism, on Salmond's recent difficulty, but at a hustings meeting in Glenrothes, fuel prices and antisocial behaviour got more attention and the audience was keener to talk about local concerns (the overcrowded A92 north to Dundee) than the future of financial capitalism or of Scotland as an independent state. </p> <p>Greedy and inept bankers were referred to only in passing. A byelection on the brink of an unquantifiably deep but certain recession is an interesting thing. Nobody was offering to make people richer, rather they were promoting rival stunts and schemes to make some of us a little less poor than most of us will inevitably be. Only Roy for Labour and Peter Grant for the SNP stand any chance of winning; even the Tory and the Lib Dem could lose their deposits. </p> <p>Grant is by far the more accomplished politician. An ex-accountant and a councillor for 16 years, he leads the SNP-Lib Dem coalition that runs Fife's regional authority, which may be his weakness because it gives his opponents a record to attack. He looks trim, speaks quickly and brims with facts, but he can be awkward and brittle under questioning. Fife's new means-tested charges for the at-home care of the sick and the disabled led to many questions from a well-organised lobby at a couple of meetings I went to, and Grant was unwise to deal with people in wheelchairs by pointing out their Trotskyist connections (\"Yes,\" came the reply, \"I belong to Solidarity, but I speak as a disabled woman\"). </p> <p>Roy is his exact opposite, a 59-year-old headteacher with no political record at all, of whom other Labour politicians speak warmly as not being like themselves (\"He's not a failed politician\", in the endorsing words of Purnell, to which an answer might be \"Not yet.\") Leaflets bill him as \"a new voice for Fife\", and his pitch is that he knows the real world - he's stopped drugs at the school gate and helped boys comatose on the pavement with drink - and that he's devoted his career to \"improving the life chances of young people in Fife\". He looks and sounds very well-meaning - tousled hair, rimless glasses - and perhaps, given his shtick of not being a professional politician, it doesn't matter that he answers several questions with: \"Only Gordon knows the answer to that\" and \"You'll need to ask Peter Mandelson.\"</p> <p>It may work. However much Fife may be changing, it would be foolish to forget the lingering loyalty to Labour bred by the coal industry. Glenrothes may be a new town and the last lump of deep-mined coal may have come out of a Fife pit 20 years ago, but Glenrothes was built to serve a mine (opened in 1957, closed five years later) and the constituency encloses several worn-looking villages where mining is a vivid familial memory; and also a port town, Methil. </p> <p>After a hustings in Methil, I spoke to a few men who'd been booing Peter Grant. Had Scottish separatism no appeal for them? \"We're stronger together as country,\" one of them said. \"And they used to say that a Fife coal miner had more in common with a Cornish tin miner than he did with the local gentry.\" </p> <p>In few other parts of Britain would you still hear sentiments like that, or a woman in a baker's shop talking about workers fighting for the vote. If Labour wins here, it will have as much to do with the remnants of working class solidarity as anything Sarah Brown will get up to. Coal has left its stubborn imprint.</p>",
  "<p>The Italian government is erasing the basic principles of democracy, ignoring all opposition and diminishing the importance of a whole country demonstrating against Berlusconi and his ministers. Students are protesting, parents with their children, university researchers, professors and directors. We live in a state where a brave writer like Roberto Saviano can't walk around safely because our government allows the mafia to be stronger than it is (Letters, October 22). We live in a country where the government ignores its commitments to Europe for the environment. Well, everywhere south of Naples is probably a lot worse than the east European countries now. As the people who have a little conscience left are finally protesting, Berlusconi is planning to send the police to stop them; the only possible dialogue will be with their truncheons.

  "<p>The three old women trudged the road to work.</p> <p>Two of them were proper old and one of them apprentice old, as if old is a matter of learning and she was still a bit too green, her balance a little too kempt, the muscles of her body still a bit too biddable. Wisdom slid out of her a touch too smoothly. Mark my words, she was saying. Cuts in jobs. Cuts in salaries. Cuts in us, they'll be laying us off. We'll get to the big house and they'll say, where's the young one who's usually with you, the one who can do the job of three old girls in half a day and for half the pay? That's what they'll say. Hard times are coming, girls.</p> <p>Cuts in hair, cuts in grass, cuts on a hot tin roof, Old Mrs Coleman said. She shambled along; she was like a tree in autumn, as if flakes of her were flaking off as she moved, like small yellow leaves on to the path beneath her own feet. Mrs Cobb laughed a wheezy laugh. Goldilocks and the One and a Half Bears, she said. Little Red Riding Ho. A Midsummer Midday Rude Awakening. The Rim of the Ancient Mariner.</p> <p>(The mariner stood at the door of the wedding, a sliced-in-half albatross round his neck, the one bloody wing dangling over the trays of crudit\u00e9s. Everybody avoided him. Listen, he said.) </p> <p>The road the old women were trudging up was the ancient path to Hinxted. It was a path that had flattened the grass to packed earth, been made and remade along the same line between the village and the woods by the feet of people working at the big house, for all the centuries the house had been there, and it was a Saturday morning in an unusually cold summer, and there was another function for the old women to function at. The woods were chilly enough at such an early hour, never mind the summer's blatant unsummeriness. It was like summer had abdicated. It was as if summer had looked at the north of Europe and thought, fuck that, I'm off on holiday to the south. It was like the summer had been slit neatly out of the year, or the calendar on the wall got at with a pair of scissors leaving a gape of wallpaper where several whole coming weeks had been.</p> <p>There they were, the three old girls, still on their way to work. They'd worked all their lives, they'd worked hard in hospitals (Mrs Cobb had been a fine disinfectant-scented nursing sister before she retired in 1987), in schools (old Mrs Coleman had been a fine teacher of 10-year-olds before she retired in 1979), in libraries (Bea had been a clever reference librarian with a voice whose strength was its steady quietness, before she'd retired in 2001). They'd worked for the required rent and mortgage, for enough for the coal then the central heating, for enough for the supermarket and the everyday needs of the families; the shoes, the Rubik's Cubes and Walkmans, the warm winter clothes. They were retired and they were still on their way to work. They were cleaners and caterers now. It was a cold morning. Maybe soon there would be no work.</p> <p>There was once two children, Bea said. Twins. Both were the age of eight. The first knew his mother was dead and his father was lost. So he set off one morning on a search for this father. He got on to a boat at Southampton and was befriended by ladies and dogs. Off went the boat into the wild sea with the child at its prow like a figurehead. The second child had been shipwrecked already. He arrived fully formed, as if from nowhere, into the life of a girl who never expected him. It was as if she'd walked through a wood like this one and stumbled across him by magic or chance just sitting there on a stump. She made a makeshift bed for him in a drawer in the caravan she lived in, and she gave him a name, and made sure he was warm and he'd plenty to eat. There. So. What happened next?</p> <p>There was once a girl, Mrs Cobb said, in love with an ass. She loved it from its nose to its tail, from the top tufts of its ears to the tarmacadam soles of its hooves. Her family and friends looked down on them; her ass was lower class. But she ignored them. It had changed her life, this love. It had made her a better person. Her golden ass. They did all the things a couple does. They even bought a teasmaid. But then, like it does, life carried on. Carry on, life! One Saturday, something had changed. She looked at the ass next to her on the sofa and it was no longer beautiful to her. It looked ordinary. It looked workaday. It looked bedraggled. She felt sick. She looked down at the magazine on her knee. She saw the shoes she was supposed to be wearing. She saw the things she was supposed to be thinking. She got up and looked in the mirror. And what did she see?</p> <p>Hinxted Hall rose into view at the end of the path. They'd be there in five minutes. The gorse on either side of them was thick with September webs. It was autumn. It was as if summer had never been.</p> <p>Where's yours, then, old Mrs C? Mrs Cobb said. (It was their practice to present each other with these conundrums, like little presents, on their way to work, then to give each other the answers they'd decided on during the day, on their way home after work.)</p> <p>I was thinking, you know, of the Bloss, old Mrs Coleman said. I was hoping she was well. I was wishing her happy. We'll miss her, we will, at the Hall. </p> <p>(Right then the Bloss was sitting in a caravan. The caravan's window looked out to sea. The fiddler was facing the sea, playing something so sweet that Bloss thought the caravan might melt. Bloss was in love with the fiddler but the fiddler was in love with the tune that came through horsehair, catgut, wood, hit the air, then vanished. The strange foundling child was asleep in a drawer under the sink. The summer morning was bright and cold. Summer? What summer?)</p> <p>She'll be back, Bea said. You can't cut a season out of a year. You can't cut the tail off a story then expect it to wag by itself. Mark my words.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Jamie Terzi, 37, has been living in Kabul for six years. She is assistant country director for Afghanistan with CARE International, an organisation that has worked in the war-torn country since 1961. A psychologist, from Melbourne, she originally was a volunteer with a women's group, before taking on her current role. She plans to leave the country next year.</strong></p> <p>I get up at about 6.30am and arrive at the office between 7.30am and 8am. I dress conservatively, usually with a long skirt and a long top, though sometimes I wear trousers. I cover my head with a headscarf but not when I am inside the office. </p> <p>A lot of what I do is office-based. These days, much as I would love to, I hardly ever get out into the field because of security. There's the threat of kidnapping and - more so a year ago - the risk of being caught up in suicide bombings, where you are not necessarily the target but you get stuck in traffic near military or government vehicles or are in front of the wrong building. There's also the threat of ambush. Or just being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. </p> <p>We follow very strict security procedures. We receive Anso [Afghan NGOs Safety Office] reports. Anso is always saying \"be vigilant, vary your routes, don't take risks, be aware of your environment\". People do that, or their organisations force them to do that, some don't allow people to walk to work - I am not allowed and I haven't driven a car myself here for three years. </p> <p>In the morning the car comes into my driveway, so I don't actually leave my property if I am not in a car. It is hard for me to vary my route but we try to take a different way when we can. </p> <p>A lot of people were surprised to learn Gayle Williams had walked to work. The reality is I don't walk outside and certainly not on my own. It is quite unusual for expatriates to walk to work. Maybe she only lived around the corner from the office, but I just wouldn't have done it. She obviously felt safe walking to work. I will have to think about walking that 50m round the corner to my friend's house.</p> <p>I wouldn't say you are more at risk if you are working for faith-based organisations. What puts us at risk is when our neutrality is compromised. It is very important to make sure that what we do as NGOs is not confused with the activities of the military or private contractors. </p> <p>Neutrality is important to us because it is what allows us to get into the communities and work with them. It is, in part, our protection. </p> <p>Security has increased. The Taliban is trying to create a climate where development stops and NGOs leave, they are trying to create a climate of fear to destabilise the country. </p> <p>I have had friends kidnapped and killed ... when the three women aid workers from the International Rescue Committee and their Afghan driver were killed in August, you can only imagine how the community felt.</p> <p>I guess people at some point can lose hope and be disheartened. Because I have been here for a while, I don't necessarily feel scared myself - I feel concerned, worried, anxious, you have heightened emotions, and you are running on adrenalin, a part of you closes in and another part of you takes over: that's what life is like here.</p>",
  "<p>It was a small but chilling symbol of 20th century consumerism. Obsessed with choice and convenience at any cost, supermarkets for years refused to put doors on fridges because they might get in the way of customers reaching in.</p> <p>Now a small but very 21st century revolution is under way. On Monday Asda will open what it claims is Britain's first superstore with doors on every freezer, fridge and chill cabinet. The initiative is part of a \u00a327m new \"low carbon\" store in Bootle, Liverpool, and this one measure alone is expected to save 8% of the building's electricity bill - and emissions. </p> <p>Asda is not alone. With electricity bills rising fast and campaigners and regulators turning up the heat on companies to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, supermarkets are opening ecostores to test a hotchpotch of improvements, from renewable energy to recycling plastic bags into kerbstones, animal-friendly products, and seeking out the green pound of more environmentally-friendly shoppers. </p> <p>With tens of millions of shoppers a week and \u00a385 out of every \u00a3100 spent on food in the UK, the supermarket chains could be a force for transforming the way people shop and encouraging suppliers around the world to reduce energy use, waste and exploitation of people and land. \"It's a healthy competition which is moving us all faster and faster,\" said Katherine Symonds, Tesco's sustainability manager.</p> <p>Others claim the very notion of an \"ecosuperstore\" is a contradiction in terms. \"While green technology can improve the environmental footprint of a building, this is a small part of a supermarket's impact, which includes emissions from food freight and customer travel to stores,\" said Helen Rimmer, campaigner for Friends of the Earth. </p> <p>Walking around the huge (recycled) brick and (sustainable) wood Bootle store, Bob Simpson, Asda's head of project development, pointed out two geothermal pumps to bring up hot water from underground aquifers and a wood pellet-burning boiler to help heat the store. </p> <p>Passing through wafts of warm bread from the bakery test on to a shopfloor busy with shelf stockers, Simpson showed off ventilators recycling \"ambient air\", sun pipes in the roof, and translucent bricks to bring in natural light but keep out the heat of the sun - and, of course, the omnipresent fridge doors. </p> <p>The fridge doors are, admitted Simpson, a leap of faith. At one store the electricity bill fell 14%, but in two sales dipped. \"I think here it will be slightly different, and that's why we've not changed them; also it's a bit late [to change] because we open on Monday,\" he said. </p> <p>The mantle of Britain's greenest supermarket changes almost monthly: in August Sainsbury's opened what it claimed was the greenest store in Dartmouth, Devon, promising to reduce emissions by 40%; Asda says Bootle will cut energy use and emissions by up to half; but Tesco claims to have already trumped that, with a 60% cut at Shrewsbury. </p> <p>Nor is carbon the only battleground: all the supermarkets have targets to cut the distance goods travel, emissions from vehicles, waste and a range of other unpopular byproducts of their business.</p> <p>One key driver has been rising electricity bills, which account for about 40% of store costs and 60% of the companies' direct emissions. \"We have seen a dramatic upturn in price that's changed the energy environment in the UK ... that's driving a totally different set of behaviours than even was the case two years ago,\" said John Ashford, head of engineering for Sainsbury's. </p> <p>The other is customers, though evidence that shoppers are lobbying for greener goods is hard to find, especially since the threat of recession.</p> <p>But supermarkets see green values as a way of winning or at least retaining customer loyalty, said Ronan Hegarty, news editor of The Grocer industry magazine: \"It's a bit of a trump card to say 'who's the greenest'.\" </p> <p>At the same time, retail bosses see the opportunity to use the cost savings to win more customers by bringing down prices, said Julian Walker-Palin, head of corporate policy for sustainability and ethics for Asda. \"Anything a supermarket does, we do for our customers. </p> <p>\"For 17 million people who shop [in Asda] each week, the majority don't understand climate change or carbon, and they don't want to. But they understand there's this issue we need to do something about; they very much [say to] their supermarket 'you have the experts, I want you to help me do the right thing',\" she said.</p> <p>The tension between sustainability and price-profit ethos has raised serious doubts about how much supermarket greening is greenwash. Critics point out there is only a handful of ecostores although all chains have less ambitious group-wide energy and emissions reduction targets.</p> <p>Fairtrade and organic products and local supplier deals make up a tiny fraction of total product lines and contracts.</p> <p>A host of other accusations are also levelled at supermarkets: bullying of suppliers, vast, oil-dependent freight networks, ruination of high street shops, millions of car miles driven by shoppers to out of town stores, promotion of unhealthy food, and the whole notion of trying to sell as many disposable consumer goods as possible. </p> <p>In what could be a turning point, Wal-Mart's chief executive, Lee Scott, this week said that on occasions the company might pay more for more sustainable products. \"We don't want to rule that out,\" said Walker-Palin. At the same time, Simpson admitted that if the fridge doors do act as a barrier to sales, some might be removed: \"It's about being brave, not stupid.\"</p> <h2>Targets</h2> <p><strong>Tesco</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Halve emissions from existing stores and distribution centres worldwide by 2020</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Halve greenhouse gas emissions per case of goods delivered worldwide by 2012 (compared with 2006)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Cut the number of carrier bags by 50% by the end of February 2009 (compared with 2006)</p> <p><strong>Asda</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce energy consumption of</p> <p>existing stores by 20% by 2012 and new stores by 30% by 2010 (compared with 2005)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send zero waste to landfill by 2010</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sell only 100% sustainably sourced fish by 2010</p> <p><strong>Morrisons</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce carbon footprint cumulatively by 36% by 2010 (from 2005)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce road miles travelled per pallet of stock by 6% by 2010</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 15% reduction in water use by 2010 (from 2005)</p> <p><strong>Marks and Spencer</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> UK &amp; Irish operations carbon neutral by 2012</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send no waste to landfill by 2012</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce carrier bag use by 33% by 2010 </p> <p><strong>Sainsbury's</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce CO2 emissions a square metre by 25% by 2012 (from 2005/06)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce CO2 emissions per case of goods transported by 5% by March 2009 (from 2005/06)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce waste sent to landfill by 50% relative to sales by 2012 (from 2005/06)</p> <p><strong>Waitrose</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce carbon dioxide emissions for UK operations by 10% by 2010, 20% by 2020 and 60% by 2050 (from 2001) </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduction of 15% in energy-related transport CO2 emissions from stores deliveries by 2013 (from 2005) </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Recycle 75% of all waste by 2012 </p> <p><strong>Research by Holly Bentley</strong></p>",
  "<p>Tens of thousands of British savers whose deposits were frozen when the Icelandic bank Icesave collapsed this month will start to get their money back in the next 10 days.</p> <p>The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) said last night it had put in place \"an accelerated process\" to start making repayments and aims to complete the process by the end of November.</p> <p>Last night's announcement ends almost three weeks of uncertainty during which affected savers have become increasingly frustrated at the lack of news from the Treasury and the FSCS. The FSCS said it would begin contacting customers to tell them how and when they will be able to withdraw their money. </p> <p>More than 300,000 savings accounts holding an estimated \u00a34bn have been frozen since Icesave's parent, Landsbanki, went into receivership on October 7.</p> <p>After Iceland allegedly refused to meet its compensation obligations, the UK chancellor vowed that no saver would lose money as a result of Icesave's failure. But since then there has been no news. The company's UK assets were frozen using anti-terror regulations.</p> <p>Iceland, the first sovereign victim of the global financial crisis, said yesterday it would borrow \u00a31.3bn from the International Monetary Fund, but the prime minister, Geir Haarde, said the country would need several billion more to resolve its financial problems.</p> <p>The FSCS said it had been working on a process that would allow former Icesave customers to electronically transfer their money back to their host bank account, almost as if they were making a withdrawal in the normal way. The payments will be phased over several weeks, and the FSCS said there would be no forms to fill in.</p> <p>Loretta Minghella, chief executive of the FSCS, said: \"We have been working hard to establish a way of compensating retail depositors of Icesave without the need for a paper-based application process. We will be contacting retail depositors to tell them how the transfer process will work and when they can access the system. We recognise that Icesave's customers have been anxious about their savings. We would like to thank them for their patience.\"</p> <p>FSCS is working closely with the Newcastle Building Society, which provided Icesave's online banking facility.</p> <p>Some savers had hundreds of thousands of pounds in Icesave accounts and thought they had lost all but the compensation limit of \u00a350,000. They also faced claiming the first \u00a316,000 from the Icelandic compensation scheme before it emerged that the money wasn't there.</p> <p>Under the terms of the compensation scheme, savers will get their savings plus interest due up to the day the bank was declared in default, October 8. </p> <p>The FSCS has already stepped in to help more than 2.7 million UK consumers as a result of the recent problems at Bradford &amp; Bingley, Heritable and Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander. </p> <p>Savers who had money in the Icelandic banks through offshore accounts have not fared so well.

  "<p>For the sweet-toothed, a job in confectionery - particularly in product-tasting - will be a mouth-watering career option. Who wouldn't want to spend their days munching on chocolate bars in the line of duty? A dream job like this will, undoubtedly, have its downside - the cost of new trousers when all that eating starts to tell on your waistline, for one thing - but it's hard to find too many. There is a variety of jobs in this field, from the scientific side of product development to marketing and getting products on to the shelves. But most of these will probably include a spot of tasting, so it's wise to get a job working on a product you like.</p> <h2>An employer says ...</h2> <p><strong>Mark Sims, graduate recruitment manager, Waitrose (<a href=\"http://www.waitrose.com/index.aspx\">waitrose.com</a>)</strong></p> <p>Many people become buyers, working in a category of food such as confectionery, after working in a store or other retail departments such as in supply chain at head office. It's important for buyers to have some experience in a branch or in retail so they have a greater understanding of how the business works. It's likely that \"partners\" (as all Waitrose employees are known) will have various roles throughout the business before moving to become a buyer.</p> <p>We have four graduate schemes in the John Lewis Partnership - two in retail management, one in John Lewis and one in Waitrose. These two schemes give a grounding in managing a large team of people in a high-pressure environment, plus commercial experience.</p> <p>Being a buyer involves the ability to see the wider picture as well as having good analytical skills. You will manage a category of food rather than a team of people. You could find yourself travelling overseas finding inspiration for new product lines, as well as liaising with suppliers and monitoring the production process all the way from the initial idea to seeing the end product on the shelves. It's very rewarding to see a product you have championed flying off the shelves of a Waitrose branch.</p> <h2>An academic says ... </h2> <p><strong>Dr Richard Frazier, head of food and bioprocessing sciences group, University of Reading (<a href=\"http://www.reading.ac.uk/\">reading.ac.uk</a>)</strong></p> <p>There are many exciting challenges facing the food industry and there is a constant demand for food science and food technology graduates who possess a strong scientific and technical skill base, combined with an understanding of how to manage consumer issues concerning food safety, quality and nutrition. Graduate careers are among the most rewarding among professional groups in terms of salary and promotion prospects. Recent graduates from Reading have gained employment in all areas of the food industry. </p> <p>We train our graduates in sensory science, which involves designing, performing and evaluating results of sensory panels. This is a key aspect of food quality.</p> <p>Generally speaking, food production companies set up taste panels to monitor the quality of products leaving the factory. This would consist of staff who have been trained to look for certain attributes of the product, and could mean tasting a wide range of products. It is rare that someone would focus on one particular food type or work individually. Taste panels are trained in the specific sensory properties of a food, such as mouth feel, texture and flavour. </p> <p>There is a shortage of food science and food technology graduates leaving UK universities and our graduates can command above-average starting salaries of about \u00a325,000 plus benefits.</p> <h2>A graduate says ...</h2> <p><strong>Gervase Fay, product developer, confectionery department, Sainsbury's (<a href=\"http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/home.htm\">sainsburys.co.uk</a>)</strong></p> <p>I've been at Sainsbury's for a year, and in my current role for two months. My job is to develop confectionery products at fair prices for customers. We look at customer needs and market location, and we go out and get inspiration, develop packaging and design and get the product delivered into stores. I'm involved in all that.</p> <p>We constantly sample products to check they meet our standards. Every week we have a sampling session to check all the products meet the Sainsbury's checklist.</p> <p>I did a degree in retail and my role is to work within the customer department, understanding their needs as well as marketing the product. We have food technicians, who need to have a food science degree, who deal with the technical aspects.</p> <p>What we look for is the right packaging and if the product tastes nice. When we taste the product we look out for the flavours - what it's like to eat, how it feels in the mouth, to bite.</p> <p>I love sampling chocolate - I could do it every day. At the moment, I'm happy to keep learning, but in the future I would like to own a small food store. I don't know what I'll sell, perhaps chocolate.</p> <p>I've just finished working on ensuring all our products have no added flavours and colours, which was a big project for us. I'm now concentrating on Easter. Christmas has been and gone for us.

  "<p>Fears of an economic slump to rival the recession of the early 1990s have wiped almost \u00a350bn off the value of Britain's top 100 companies and sent stockmarkets around the world into a tailspin.</p> <p>The wave of panic selling in the City followed warnings that the tiger economies of the far east, which have so far escaped the worst of the financial crisis, would also see a sharp slowdown in growth.</p> <p>Major continental exchanges plunged by as much as 9%, while in the US the Dow Jones industrial index slumped more than 3% as traders digested a week of dire warnings, including an unusually frank admission of impending recession from the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King.</p> <p>Banks again led the downward trend, particularly HSBC and Standard Chartered, both of which have extensive operations in Asia. But all leading shares lost value, with little sign of the situation stabilising over the next few weeks.</p> <p>In Japan, Sony warned that demand for consumer electronics was down and its analysis was echoed by Korea's Samsung. Profit warnings from the two firms worked to drag down the value of rival electronics groups Philips and US stockmarket darling Apple, along with UK retailer Currys, which lost 15% of its value.</p> <p>Data from the Office for National Statistics showing that national income shrank for the first time in 16 years, by 0.5% between July and September, was blamed for much of the stockmarket decline. Britain was the first of the seven most-developed industrialised nations to publish economic data for the period and some economists said they expected the other six nations to report similar declines in economic output.</p> <p>\"This is going to be a long drawn-out downturn of about five quarters of negative growth, and there will be very few major economies that will escape recession,\" said James Knightley, an economist at ING Financial Markets in London. \"With asset values falling, real incomes down and corporate profits declining we can see a real drop in investments, and the government is in no position to help.\"</p> <p>The figures confirmed comments this week by Gordon Brown and Mervyn King that a recession is likely. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said on Wednesday that Britain's economy would suffer more than other big industrialised countries because of a combination of rising household and public debt, a sharp fall in consumer spending, and declining house prices.</p> <p>Richard Hunter of stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown said bank shares would continue to suffer and a large increase in arrears and repossessions was expected as unemployment rises and a squeeze on family incomes tightens over Christmas.</p> <p>Royal Bank of Scotland slumped 9% to little more than 60p a share, while HBOS dived 15% to settle at 59.8p. Both banks, which expect to be partially nationalised by the government, have seen 90% of their value wiped out since a peak early last year. HSBC and Standard Chartered were considered safe havens until yesterday, when Asian nations signalled they were also expecting hard times ahead. India cut interest rates to stimulate the country's flagging economy. On Wall Street stocks fell sharply within minutes of the opening bell, but fears of a dramatic collapse to match the banking crisis of a fortnight ago were somewhat allayed as the Dow finished down 312 points or 3.5%.</p> <p>There was a glimmer of economic relief in data showing a 5.5% rise in US home purchases during August. The National Association of Realtors suggested that, in terms of sales, the depressed property market appeared to have bottomed out.</p> <p>On the stockmarket big losers included the ailing motor industry. General Motors shares slumped by 13% on fresh rumours, hotly denied by the company, that it could file for bankruptcy. Energy companies suffered a pounding as the price of a barrel of crude oil reached a 17-month low. Chevron's shares dropped by 6% during early trading, while Exxon Mobil slipped 3.2%.</p> <p><strong>Oil production</strong></p> <p>An emergency cut in production by Opec failed to halt the ongoing slide in the oil price yesterday, as analysts warned that the cartel could be forced into squeezing supply further. Opec's decision, made by oil ministers meeting at the organisation's Vienna headquarters, drew criticism from the British and American governments and appeared to spell the end to further price cuts at the UK's petrol pumps.</p> <p>The 13-nation cartel - which includes Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq - decided to reduce production by 1.5m barrels a day in an attempt to shore up the oil price after what it described as \"a dramatic collapse unprecedented in speed and magnitude\". But the cartel's action failed to have the desired effect, with the cost of a barrel of US light crude slipping almost $3 in late European trading to just under $65.</p> <p>Since hitting a peak of $147 in July, the oil price has more than halved as the world economy slides towards recession.</p> <p>Hugo Navarro, an oil market analyst at Capital Economics, predicted Opec would be forced into further cuts, representing a total reduction of 4m barrels a day by the end of 2009. Yesterday's action would not stop the price falling, he warned. \"The global economy is going to be getting worse in the next 12 months. We haven't seen the worst of it yet.\"</p> <p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, said Opec's decision was disappointing. \"Governments in the Gulf and governments in the far east, Europe and America are all in this together,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. \"We should make sure we act together.\" The prime minister echoed the criticism.</p> <p><strong>Sterling fall</strong></p> <p>The pound suffered its biggest fall in 16 years against the dollar early yesterday as official data showed the UK economy had contracted for the first time since the early 1990s. Sterling plummeted 10 cents at one stage to a six-year low of $1.5270 after figures from the Office for National Statistics showed a 0.5% decline in the economy in the third quarter of the year, far worse than the 0.2% contraction analysts had expected. It later recovered to around $1.5870 - still 6% down on the day.</p> <p>Just over two months ago the pound was worth $2 but it has now shed more than 25% of its value against the dollar. Sterling also fell to a record low against the euro, slipping from \u20ac1.256 overnight to \u20ac1.2205, making a euro worth around 82p. On a trade weighted basis, the UK currency has declined by 8% since August.</p> <p>Piers Cracknell, commercial director at currency specialist Moneycorp, said: \"The pound is falling against the dollar at its fastest rate for 16 years - faster than at any time since the UK came out of the exchange rate mechanism.</p> <p>\"Anxiety about the UK economy reached new heights on Friday as figures confirmed negative growth for the third quarter of this year. Risk-averse investors are abandoning the lame-duck pound for the lower-risk US dollar and, in particular, US treasury bonds. The implications of this for a country so heavily reliant on its imports as the UK may be severe.\"</p> <p>Opposition parties criticised the government. The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, said: \"Gordon Brown has set a new record for Labour governments, but it's not one he's likely to boast about. The 25% fall in the value of the pound over the last year is even greater than the devaluations under Jim Callaghan and Harold Wilson. It's a sign that international investors think Britain is badly prepared, as boom turns to bust.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338986172\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/10/24/OIL_PRICE_2510.gif\" alt=\"oil\" width=\"231\" height=\"212\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",
  "<p>Thanks to the movie, people tend to assume that they know about John Updike's The Witches of Eastwick: it's the one where a hammy devil sexes up some frustrated divorcees. This isn't totally accurate. Set in the early 70s, the book is as much a satire on baby-boomer liberationism as an amused updating of witchcraft lore. </p> <p>Alexandra, Sukie and Jane, the witches, have supernatural powers deriving from their status as divorced women in their sexual prime. All three are involved with married men before Darryl Van Horne appears on the scene. Alexandra is a good deal less skinny than Cher, Jane is nastier than Susan Sarandon's character, and Van Horne is a shambling, bisexual impresario with a mask-like face and, we're told, ice-cold semen. When a younger rival marries him, the trio give her cancer. </p> <p>Witches was Updike's first sustained effort to put female characters centre-stage. While the writing, as always, is permanently cranked up to 11, the women are impressively realised figures. At the same time, there's a weird double-vision at work. The idea of sexuality as a kind of witchcraft is pitched as an ironic exaggeration of a small town's fear of liberated women. Yet the tongues wagging against the central characters emerge from a post-60s backdrop that's imagined in a distinctly small-town way. The witches' most bitter enemies are self-righteous liberals, and we hear a fair bit about drug-addled hippies, bomb-throwing war protesters and scary black people. Updike's attitude towards these culture-war cliches is mysterious; he doesn't always play them strictly for laughs. But perhaps, as Margaret Atwood wrote at the time, \"any attempt to analyse further would be like taking an elephant gun to a puff pastry: an Updike should not mean but be\".</p> <p>A similar proviso applies, in spades, to Updike's latest novel, which catches up with the three women as they get to grips with mortality. At the end of Witches, they remarried and went their separate ways. Alexandra has ended up in New Mexico with her laconic former art teacher; the others have stayed behind on the east coast - Jane as the wife of an effete Boston Brahmin, Sukie as a romantic novelist married to a loutish salesman. All three husbands die, of natural causes, and the ageing former witches get in touch with one another. Earth-motherish Alexandra is the main point-of-view character, as before. Jane, still cynical and malicious, though now addicted to puns, has become rich. Sukie, the sexy one, has lost half her lung function to emphysema but is otherwise herself. They cook up a plan: why not spend a summer in Eastwick? </p> <p>First, though, Updike spends 100 pages lavishing his descriptive resources on an account of their earlier adventures in package tourism. Alexandra responds to widowhood by taking a guided tour of the Canadian Rockies, where they use different money and a fellow tourist who resembles her dead husband disappoints her by referring to his late \"partner\" (\"This fag had been wasting her time\"). </p> <p>Next, she and Jane take a trip to Egypt, which turns out to contain pyramids, tombs and a museum, all of which are reviewed at length, plus potentially scary Muslims. Finally, all three women visit China, where food is eaten with chopsticks. (\"This was China, teeming under Heaven's mandate.\") The strange thing about this section, apart from its narrative pointlessness, is the self-consciousness with which Updike sets about transcribing stereotypes concerning foreign parts. One page-long sentence inscrutably catalogues American notions of China, from \"dragon ladies, rickshaws and comic-strip pirates\" to \"competitor for the dwindling global supply of oil\", via \"tender seedbed of budding free enterprise\". </p> <p>When the action shifts to Eastwick, a plot of sorts emerges. Chris, the younger brother of the girl they cursed, now \"an overweight poof\", plans to take magical vengeance. This plotline is resolved in an unexpected way (Sukie seduces him with the aid of a strap-on dildo), but not before the women have all got naked at a defensive witches' sabbath, leading to a description of \"once thick and springy curls turning gauzy and gray, pubic clocks ticking unseen, decade after decade, in their underpants\". As you'd expect, there are cranky discussions of mobile phones, facial piercings, and how \"all this hooking up the young people do\" is soulless and mechanical in comparison to their adulterous high jinks in the 70s. Cancelling out the earlier book's amoralism, Jane is dramatically punished for her sins. Meanwhile, Alexandra has an epiphany during a meal with her grandchildren: she will live on through her descendents, \"layers of inheritance and affinity invisibly ramifying\". </p> <p>Updike has had a long and distinguished career. In some quarters, the Rabbit books are said to put him in the company of Saul Bellow and Philip Roth. Like many of his minor works, The Widows of Eastwick lends more weight to the view of him as an almost spookily unreflective channeller and prettifier of baby-boom Americana, with a selectively blind eye to various uglinesses and a sideline in overwritten vagina-descriptions. All the same, whatever you make of his writing style, there's no denying that the facility with which he turns out those lovingly cadenced, alliterative sentences is an awe-inspiring spectacle. In spite of its absurdities, the new book keeps this up, every now and then throwing out a simile (an old churchgoer's corpse \"as brittle and dry as a flower pressed in a Bible\") that even his detractors would have to call pretty good.</p>",
  "<p>Aid workers in Afghanistan have expressed surprise that a charity allowed one of its volunteers to walk to and from work in Kabul despite an increased security threat to NGO workers in the country. </p> <p>Gayle Williams was gunned down in the street last Tuesday by two men on a motorbike. Taliban insurgents later claimed responsibility for her killing.</p> <p>Williams, 34, a British-South African dual national, was a volunteer with the Christian charity organisation Serve Afghanistan, which helps people with disabilities. She had worked in the country for more than two years. </p> <p>Mike Lyth, Serve's chairman, said that the organisation had a very tight security policy and Williams had been pulled out of Kandahar this year after a risk analysis. </p> <p>\"She was walking in an area which was considered to be safe, and the walk was just a few minutes,\" he said. \"We trained all of our staff, including Gayle, to vary their route and we always radio in when we leave home and again when we arrive. There are many NGOs that walk and a few that don't. We have to be able to get out and get things and there's a need to be able to walk a certain distance.</p> <p>\"Our information is that this was an opportunistic killing.\"</p> <p>Many NGOs operate a strict policy of no walking in cities following attacks on foreign and local staff working across the country. July, August and September had more attacks on NGO staff than at any time since records began in 2002, and this year 29 people working for NGOs have been killed. Seventy-two have been abducted.</p> <p>Robin Greenwood, Christian Aid's head of Asia and Middle East, said his staff had been forbidden from walking in cities for three-and-a-half years and it had been made very clear in the guidelines. </p> <p>\"Our policy is that staff travel from home to office and office to meetings by vehicle, no matter what the distance. This is because we have been advised by our security advisers and have seen from experience that people who are out walking are more vulnerable. We used to walk but stopped. This is a policy that is certainly shared by a lot of other international NGOs in Afghanistan.\"</p> <p>The Afghanistan NGO Security Office (Anso) informs 190 NGOs of security risk and this week told 80 directors that \"anyone that believed that Kabul was not capable of an incident like this [Williams's murder] was frankly kidding themselves\".</p> <p>An Anso spokesman said: \"We inform people of the security environment and it is the responsibility of the agencies to come up with their own policy ... generally we advise people to take a number of measures that minimise the opportunities for things to happen to them. Moving by vehicle is less risky than by foot, but we don't tell people that as a blanket thing.\"</p> <p>One female aid worker, who wished to remain anonymous for security reasons, said: \"I wouldn't have done it. I think she exposed herself to a risk.</p> <p>\"I only mean I don't think it is appropriate for a woman, a foreigner, to walk alone in the streets even at eight o'clock in the morning.\"</p>",
  "<p>At a time when a crisis is unfolding that will deflate American power irreversibly, the next US administration could be elected on the back of voters for whom denying women abortion choice and promoting creationism in schools are more important than the state of the world at large. To be sure, the financial crisis may allow American voters to overcome the drag of racism and elect Obama, despite his obvious intellectual superiority. But whatever the outcome, the leadership of the world's largest liberal democracy is not going to be decided by anything like rational argument, or by concern for problems that lie beyond America's shores.</p> <p>The upcoming American election kept coming to mind as I read Chris Patten's What Next?. In many ways this is an extremely impressive book. It is a very long time since a leading British politician produced anything so ambitious, or as well written. The subject is nothing less than the global condition at the start of this century. Nuclear proliferation, global warming, oil production and the energy crisis, world poverty and the \"bottom billion\", the illegal drugs trade, immigration and human trafficking and the spread of epidemic diseases are all examined, with asides on Russia, China and practically every important development in world history since the Renaissance. </p> <p>Patten is rightly scornful of some aspects of current political discourse: \"You do not need to be a grammarian,\" he writes, \"to know that you do not fight wars against common nouns but against personal ones. You fight a war against this or that country or enemy. Wars on drugs, wars on poverty, wars on waste - all these things are idle if grandiose ways of describing doomed political ventures.\" It is a crucial point, elegantly stated. But whoever wins the presidential election, the next administration is sure to want to ramp up America's bungling \"war on terror\", most likely by taking the failed Afghan campaign into Pakistan. Maybe the war on terror will simply implode, along with the American financial system. Certainly, the vast levels of military </p> <p>expenditure of the past 20 years cannot be sustained. But it is hard to see the US, which alone among the countries engaged in Afghanistan still believes the war can be won, quietly departing the scene. A political solution is nowhere on the agenda. Even Obama has urged that US forces hunt down the Taliban by following them into Pakistan. If this happens America will have mired itself and the world in another intractable conflict, this time in an increasingly unstable state that is also nuclear.</p> <p>Throughout his conspectus of global issues Patten is supremely confident that he knows what needs to be done. Despite occasional swipes at recent policies, What Next? is conventional wisdom of the most elevated kind and, like all versions of the genre, it avoids unmentionable realities. For example, while he discusses population growth in passing on several occasions - mostly in conjunction with a dismissive reference to Thomas Malthus - Patten at no point confronts the vast problems posed by the fact that human numbers will rise by around another 50% over the next half-century. Informing the reader that in the second millennium \"the world's population increased 22-fold, while global domestic product went up 13 times as fast,\" he shows no hint of doubt that, as long as globalisation continues, this trend will also continue. </p> <p>In failing to consider the possibility that there may be a human population problem Patten has plenty of company. He is at one with Marx, Hayek, Mao, the Pope, the Bush administration and many development economists. But is this near-universal denial of natural limits on human expansion well-founded? Or is it no more than a silly orthodoxy, like the faith of an earlier generation of bien pensants that central planning would create an economy of abundance?</p> <p>An integral part of conventional wisdom is the conviction that all reasonable people subscribe to it, and this faith lies at the heart of Patten's view of the world. Stung by a rightwing commentator who, in response to his rather modest criticisms of the Iraq war, described him as a \"liberal internationalist\", Patten writes: \"To my mind there is nothing else for a sensible person to be\". Evidently, Patten thinks the same is true of most of the opinions aired in the book. At times - in his analysis of the Iraq war, for example - he is plainly right. What is questionable is his assumption that the thinking that led to the Iraq war will prove to be an aberration.</p> <p>Patten begins What Next? by citing approvingly Margaret Thatcher's remark at her last cabinet meeting, \"It's a funny old world.\" By the end of the book, however, it is clear that he sees the past eight years as a blip on the screen of history. Along with liberals across the world, he is confident that, with a new incumbent in the White House, what could be considered normal service will be resumed. \"To live in a better world,\" he writes, \"requires a more democratic citizenry, a sentiment inherent in Senator Obama's presidential campaign oratory.\" But what if the debacle on Wall Street leaves America fear-ridden, resentful and more stridently fundamentalist - whoever becomes president? It looks as if the future of the world is going to be funnier than Patten imagines. </p> <p>\u2022 John Gray's Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia is published by Penguin.</p>",
  "<p>We sat in the <strong>Wind Dog Cafe</strong> (01957 744321, <a href=\"http://www.winddogcafe.co.uk\">winddogcafe.co.uk</a>) at Gutcher on the island of Yell, waiting for the ferry to take us to Unst. Outside, the channel between the islands was grey, choppy and beaten by rain. Inside the Wind Dog Cafe it was bright and warm. The cafe might not subscribe to the niceties of modern metropolitan design chic. It is too practical for that. But then, most modern metropolitan cafes don't double as library, arts and community centre, and internet hub as well. Oh, and it's a great place from which to spot otters. The soups are rollicking, warming, homemade concoctions. There's a crofter's lunch of ham, cheese, oatcakes and pickle; bannocks are filled with cold Shetland lamb; the baked potatoes are island grown; and cakes, biscuits and pies are baked on the premises. Just the kind of food needed to keep the weather at bay.</p> <p>\"We have a phrase in Shetland. We say we're atween weathers,\" said Alastair Hamilton, my guide, mentor and passionate advocate of Shetland's foods, as we peered out the windows. It had snowed two days earlier, rarer than you might think in Shetland. The day before had been bright and sunny. Now rain was flying in on the wind.</p> <p>Any visitor to Shetland - Shetland, mind, never the Shetlands; Shetlanders will purse their lips together in mild remonstrance should you say \"the Shetlands\" - had better go prepared for rapid changes in meteorological conditions. There are 100 or so islands that make up the archipelago. They lie, green and low, hummocks in the turbulent sea 130 miles to the north of Scotland. Like pieces of a jigsaw slightly strewn out on the sea, they look as if, with a little ingenuity, they could all be fitted back together. In a sense, they do all fit together. There is a strong sense of community and interrelation between the 15 that are regularly inhabited. </p> <p>Not only is Scotland quite a long way away, geographically speaking, it's almost treated as a foreign country by Shetlanders themselves. You don't often see the Saltire on display. Tartans are nowhere to be seen. Indeed, it only became part of Scotland in 1469.</p> <p>Alastair and I were on our way to the <strong>Skibhoul Stores &amp; Bakery </strong>(01957 711304) on Unst, overlooking Baltasound, where Penny Thompson sells just about everything you might need by way of food supplies, but also makes Oceanic Oatcakes, so called because she has replaced the salt with seawater. In every other sense, they are classic oatcakes: mild, wholesome and addictive. I bought several packets to keep me company.</p> <p>Inevitably, the sea dominates Shetland's history. During the late-19th and early-20th centuries, crafts, ships and fortunes were built on cod, ling and, above all, herring, caught on longlines from sixareens - six-oared fishing boats. You can see two splendid sixareens in the <strong>Shetland Museum</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.shetland-museum.org.uk\">shetland-museum.org.uk</a>) in Lerwick. Conveniently, the museum has a stylish canteen, where you can order traditional dishes such as a homely sassermaet (sausagemeat) burger, based on a 19th-century recipe, local salt beef, Shetland lamb bannocks and potted rabbit, as well as more modern combinations.</p> <p>There's still a healthy fishing industry around Shetland, landing cod, herring, skate, saithe and halibut, but the innumerable inlets, crystalline waters and ferocious tidal races have made it a key centre in the mussel and salmon farming industries. It's impossible to miss the strings of large black buoys, like humps of the Loch Ness monster's back, neatly lined up in blocks, or the circular salmon pens.</p> <p>Mussels and salmon cropped up on a good many menus. I had memorable mussels in a white wine and cream sauce at <strong>Monty's Bistro</strong> (01595 696555), a bright, lively upstairs restaurant in Lerwick (with a notably easily priced wine list, incidentally). The flesh of the crustacea was plump, sweet and quivery against the gently rich sauce. Thick slices of delicate, firm, close-textured smoked salmon contributed to a fine seafood platter at the<strong> Olive Tree </strong>(01595 697222), an immensely cheery deli-cum cafe in Lerwick, run by the redoubtable Bo Simmons. And just around the corner from the Olive Tree is the <strong>Hand-Made Fish Company</strong> (01950 422214, <a href=\"http://www.handmadefish.com\">handmadefish.com</a>) where Dave Parham, a refugee from Devon, produces superb smoked haddock and, to my mind, even better smoked organic salmon, experimenting with the effects of various woods, including larch (interesting and rather good) and juniper (too fugitive for my crude taste buds), while relying on old oak whisky barrels (smoky, sweet and brilliant) for his general stock. </p> <p>Dave's smoked haddock surfaced on the breakfast menu at the comfortable and cosy <strong>Busta Hotel </strong>(01806 522506, <a href=\"http://www.bustahouse.com\">bustahouse.com</a>, doubles from \u00a3105 B&amp;B), a 16th-century laird's house overlooking Brae Voe, where I stayed. Aside from big-hearted breakfasts, the kitchen makes full use of local lamb, free-range pork from Unst, Muckle Roe mussels, halibut from Bressay, and Yell Sound scallops. Even the milk, cream and butter are produced locally.</p> <p>Indeed, generally, the raw materials in Shetland are as good as anywhere in the UK, which means they are very good indeed. I couldn't say that public cooking yet is in quite the same class. However, the Shetland Islands Council is beginning to address the need, and this month saw the first Shetland Food Festival, opened by Jean-Christophe Novelli, who immediately sent the local rumour-mill into overdrive by declaring that he wanted to open a cookery school on one of the islands.</p> <p>There is a good deal to be said for meandering up through the islands, as I did. For the outdoor enthusiast there are great walks, such as along the black basalt cliffs at Eshaness. There's fishing to be had in the sea and lochs. There's a good deal for the keen birder. And there's plenty of evidence of Shetland's vigorous past going back 3,000 years, particularly the monumental brochs, giant stone towers like hives. </p> <p>As my flight lifted into the air from Sumburgh airport, I looked out of the window. The land and sea below me were bathed in warm sunshine. Was that just a lull atween storms?

  "<p>Not so long ago people lived with the real fear that at any moment a nuclear apocalypse could end life on earth. Today we are afraid of global warming. And financial meltdown. Oh yes, and terrorism, too. Then there's the flu pandemic, not to mention cancer-causing chemicals in our food, street crime and paedophile teachers. In the UK we're so afraid of each other that we have one CCTV camera for every 14 people. But ironically, we are safer and healthier now than at any time in our history. According to Lars Svendsen, a Norwegian philosopher, \"our fear is a by-product of luxury\". The mass media, pressure groups and the nanny state are all guilty of stoking the current climate of paranoia. Fear is a powerful emotion. It can save lives. But it also \"robs us of our freedom\" and undermines that essential social glue: trust. Bertrand Russell once said that \"to conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom\". Svendsen agrees. In this brief yet wide-ranging and insightful book, he argues convincingly that we need to replace the risk society with a culture of hope and trust.</p>",
  "<p>How many old mobile phone handsets have you got lurking unused in the back of drawers at home? Probably at least two, according to new research from price comparison website <a href=\"http://moneysupermarket.com\">moneysupermarket.com</a>, which next week launches a campaign to encourage people to help the environment, and possibly make a bit of cash, by recycling their old mobiles.</p> <p>As people regularly upgrade for the latest model, more than 1.5m handsets - many in working order - are thrown away each year because more than two-thirds of users fail to recycle them.</p> <p>\"The average person has two old mobiles, increasing to an average of three for those under 20. That's a huge number lying around that could be put to good use through recycling,\" says James Parker, commercial manager of mobiles and broadband at the website.</p> <p>Hazardous components - especially lead, cadmium and mercury in the batteries - can pose a threat to the environment if they are discarded in landfill sites. But working handsets can be reused, while those that are past it can be stripped down and their various components recycled.</p> <p>The bonus for consumers is that the companies that collect and process mobiles for reuse and recycling are willing to pay for some handsets, depending on the model, age and condition. It can be anything from a couple of quid to more than \u00a3200 for the newest, most popular models.</p> <p>Selling your phone to one of these outfits is straightforward. On websites like envirofone.com, Mazuma Mobile (<a href=\"http://mazumamobile.com\">mazumamobile.com</a>), Mobile2Cash (<a href=\"http://www.mobile2cash.co.uk\">mobile2cash.co.uk</a>) and Love2Recycle (<a href=\"http://www.love2recycle.com\">love2recycle.com</a>), which is partnering <a href=\"http://moneysupermarket.com\">moneysupermarket.com</a> in the campaign, you can look up the price on offer for your phone.</p> <p>If you are happy to sell for that price, fill in your details online. You are usually sent a free padded mailing envelope. You can track the progress of your mobile on the website and, once processed, you will be sent a cheque, or the cash will be paid directly into your bank account.</p> <p>\"Customers come on to our site to renew their mobile contracts or look for a better deal, which often involves getting a new handset. So, as we're effectively pushing new phones into the market, we feel it's our responsibility to make people aware there are options for recycling,\" says Parker. The partnership's website, <a href=\"http://moneysupermarket.love2recycle.com\">moneysupermarket.love2recycle.com</a>, will pay an average \u00a325 to recycle an old phone.</p> <p>But this may be misleading. Many older models are worth very little, if anything at all, while a few top models are worth a lot more. Nokia phones on the website's pricelist, for example, include \u00a3105 for a functioning N95, \u00a348.10 for an 8800, \u00a34.10 for a 1110, a 1112 or a 1208, \u00a32.10 for a 3410 and nothing at all for a 5510 or a 9000.</p> <p>Non-functioning phones have some value, but are worth less than those in full working order - prices paid by processing websites are generally 30% to 50% lower.</p> <p>An alternative to profiting yourself from recycling an old handset is to pass on any value to a good cause. Many charities, both large and small, have teamed up with specialist processing organisations such as Greener Solutions (<a href=\"http://www.greenersolutions.co.uk\">greenersolutions.co.uk</a>) and the Recycling Appeal (<a href=\"http://recyclingappeal.com\">recyclingappeal.com</a>) to collect old mobiles for refurbishment or recycling. </p> <p>The amount charities receive for each handset depends on the individual arrangement they come to with the processing company and on how much of the promotional work they do themselves.</p> <p>The RSPB, for example, which works with the Recycling Appeal, receives varying amounts depending on the condition and age of each handset, working out at an average of \u00a35 per recyclable phone returned. Almost \u00a384,000 has been raised since the arrangement started in 2005.</p> <p>Guide Dogs for the Blind, which works with Greener Solutions, receives a flat rate \u00a33.50 per phone, regardless of its age or condition, and has brought in more than 258,000 phones, raising over \u00a3900,000 in the past seven years.</p> <p>Charities with a scheme in place will normally be able to send you a free envelope, and some charities offer a pick-up service if you collect a large enough quantity of phones. Many schools benefit from similar arrangements - check out Fones4Schools (<a href=\"http://fones4schools.co.uk\">fones4schools.co.uk</a>), for example.</p> <p>You can also hand in handsets for recycling at high street mobile phone shops.</p>",
  "<p>The full scale of the persecution of Christians in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul became apparent last night when the UN's refugee agency said about 13,000 had been hounded from their homes this month - more than half of the city's Christian community.</p> <p>The UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) said it was sending aid to thousands of Christian refugees fleeing Mosul after a three-week campaign of killing and intimidation. About a dozen Christians have reportedly been killed in the recent violence, prompting many members of the community to seek sanctuary in churches and homes in outlying villages, or in Syria. \"Many left with little money and need help,\" said Ron Redmond, UNHCR spokesman, in a briefing from Geneva. Christian neighbourhoods had been bombarded with threatening phone calls, letters and messages pinned to doors for months, but the killing began a few weeks ago, he said. </p> <p>Recounting the story of a woman named Mariam, Redmond said she left her home when she heard of a Christian who was murdered.</p> <p>\"We were the hard core that never wanted to leave Iraq, even with the tense environment,\" the woman, who fled to Syria, was quoted by UNHCR as saying.</p> <p>No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks, but suspicion has fallen on Sunni extremists intent on turning the historic city into a stronghold.</p> <p>Local Sunni officials deny the allegation, pointing the finger at Kurdish militias who, it is said, want to empty the city of Christians before upcoming local elections. The Kurdish regional government also denies the claims.</p> <p>Mosul, Iraq's third biggest city after Baghdad and Basra, has remained mired in violence despite the US military surge. Al-Qaida insurgents regrouped in the city after being flushed out of neighbouring Anbar province, taking advantage of its proximity to Syria. </p> <p>After a period of relative calm roadside bombs and assassinations gradually returned to Mosul, giving it the reputation as the Iraq's most dangerous city.</p> <p>The province of Nineveh, which has Mosul at its heart, has been home to Assyrian and Chaldean Catholics for 2,000 years. Before the fall of Saddam Hussein Iraq's Christian population numbered about 1.2 million.</p> <p>But the upsurge of violence has prompted a mass exodus, with 20% of the 1.5 million Iraqi refugees in Syria thought to be Christians.</p> <p>The return of sustained religious violence will also raise fears over Iraq's fragile security and lend weight to calls for the Iraqi government to give US troops a legal mandate to maintain security for a further three years.</p> <p>Meanwhile a Shia cleric, Jalaluddin al-Saghir, yesterday endorsed a draft US-Iraqi security pact. \"The country is passing through a most critical stage,\" Saghir said. \"The politicians should think about Iraq's interests. They should not seek to break the unity of Iraqi society. This is not a game.\" The proposed agreement has been opposed by a number of critics, including the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who say it infringes Iraq's sovereignty.</p>",
  "<p>The airline industry's woes deepened yesterday as it posted its biggest drop in passenger numbers in five years and Ryanair abandoned a Spanish base in a costs row. </p> <p>Aviation has been a harbinger of the global downturn after record oil prices forced more then 30 airlines into bankruptcy this year and traffic figures from the International Air Transport Association (Iata) indicate the screw is being turned.</p> <p>Global traffic fell 2.9% last month, the most significant deterioration since the Sars outbreak in 2003, according to Iata. Giovanni Bisignani, Iata chief executive, said the \"alarmingly fast-paced and widespread\" fall in demand could result in the industry posting a deeper loss than the $5.2bn (\u00a33.3bn) expected this year.</p> <p>Crippling fuel costs have grounded a number of UK-based carriers, including Silverjet and Zoom, but a global recession poses a greater threat to even the biggest airlines as demand slumps. </p> <p>Air France-KLM, the world's largest airline by revenue, issued a profit warning yesterday after admitting it would be \"very difficult\" to reach its \u20ac1bn (\u00a3790m) operating profit target.</p> <p>\"The industry crisis is deepening along with the crisis in the global economy,\" said Bisignani. \"The worst is likely still to come. We will have a very difficult year.\" </p> <p>Iata said the passenger load factor, or the proportion of seats sold per flight, had fallen from 78.8% to 74.8% - confirming some analysts' fears that the industry remains bloated. \"Falling load factors show the industry has too much capacity. The issue is whether it can cut capacity fast enough to keep up fares against a declining market,\" said Chris Tarry, chairman of the CTAIRA consultancy.</p> <p>Iata recently predicted a two-year recession in the industry, with carriers expected to report a combined loss of $9.3bn for 2008-09. According to September figures, traffic fell nearly 7% in Asia-Pacific from the same month last year, and by 0.5% in Europe. The world's largest market, North America, was down 0.9%.</p> <p>Ryanair, the world's biggest airline in terms of international flights, announced its withdrawal from Valencia yesterday after the airport refused to subsidise its marketing campaigns. Michael Cawley, Ryanair deputy chief executive, said the removal of its two airplanes from Valencia would cost the regional economy about 750 jobs. \"This is a very black day for the airport of Valencia, and the city and region which it serves,\" said Cawley. </p> <p>Analysts said Ryanair's first base closure underlined the pressure on airlines to keep down costs. Under its business model, Ryanair must sell more than eight out of 10 seats a flight and relies on low fares to do this. However, as the economy weakens, so does demand, resulting in pressure to cut fares to stimulate sales.</p> <p>\"They are clearly pushing very hard on every cost line and demanding cuts in operating costs at airports where they believe there is leverage,\" said Andrew Lobbenberg, a Royal Bank of Scotland analyst. He said the clash with Valencia might win concessions from other airports. </p> <p>\"It is probably useful for Ryanair to cancel a few airports just to lend credibility to their threats to the others,\" he said. </p> <p>Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said this month that the airline was braced for a downturn of up to five years.</p>",
  "<p>Rob Schofield turns off his pager. He's finished a long shift as a junior doctor at the Countess of Chester Hospital. His colleagues might be going home to relax in front of the television or grab some well-earned sleep, but Schofield dons his red pants and cape and heads out to carry on his life-saving in nearby Flint.</p> <p>Well, I don't know if his pants are red but his work certainly isn't done when he leaves the hospital. \"I switch my work pager off and immediately put my lifeboat pager on,\" he says, \"and go where I have to go.\" Schofield, a University of Liverpool graduate, has been a volunteer lifeboat crew member with the RNLI in Flint for the last seven years and for the last year he's been a helmsman, in charge of lifeboats on callouts.</p> <p>There are times when the lifeboats are quiet but, says Schofield, this year has been a busy one. \"We average around 24 callouts per year but this year so far we've had 40,\" he says. And the gamut of problems is a huge one. \"We get reports of people in the river, jumpers off the bridge, kids on sandbanks, fishermen stuck, all sorts,\" he explains. \"We honestly don't know what the next call will be.\"</p> <p>When Schofield joined the RNLI he was a student on a Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme but now he has a high-pressure job, he has no intention of giving up. \"It's second-to-none,\" he says, \"my only problem is not being able to attend lifeboat shouts when I am at the hospital.\" And far from being extra stress in his life, he says it provides a break. \"It's quite different from my day job and I really enjoy it. It is my leisure time.\"</p> <p>The RNLI has a total of 4,500 lifeboat crew members and 35,000 fundraisers. Only one in 10 of its lifeboat crew has a professional maritime occupation.</p> <p>Being a lifesaver in his day job and night job, says Schofield, is not something he gives too much thought to: \"It's amazing to make a difference to people's lives though. Last Christmas we had a guy who was drifting in the sea. When we arrived, he had been in the water for 20 minutes and was hypothermic. He'd been drinking but we managed to get him back.

It feels great to be able to serve my country.\"</p> <p>Being in the TA, as well as enabling her to do something good, says Stanley, means she has learned transferable workplace skills. \"I have become more self-confident and comfortable pushing myself,\" she says, \"I have a real can-do attitude and I am used to doing things under pressure now.\"</p> <p>In terms of the time she puts into the TA, \"it's always going to be a challenge juggling with a full-time job,\" she agrees, \"but getting out into the open stretches my mind in an altogether different way and it really teaches me to prioritise.

  "<p>Another winter of discontent they were calling it yesterday, but such glib historical references are way off-beam. For one thing, the recession that Britain is plunging into could easily last more than one winter. For another, the people on strike this time are not public sector workers but bankers who are refusing to do their jobs and lend to each other. The peculiar nastiness of the great banking crisis of 2008 was on display again yesterday: financial markets began the day fretting about a global recession; in the mid-morning, the economic damage wreaked by crisis-hit markets was illustrated with news of a sharp drop in national income; for the rest of the day, markets slid on worries about how a big recession would affect the stability of banks and other companies. Worry piled on top of worry and the result was yet another market panic, with the FTSE dropping 5% and the pound routed.</p> <p>There will be more such grisly days for some time to come. Financial markets and the real economy are caught in a grievous feedback loop, with a drought in credit forcing businesses and individuals to default on their loans and so intensifying the reluctance of banks to lend. Try as he might, Alistair Darling cannot break this cycle: on Thursday the chancellor prevailed upon bankers to treat small businesses more leniently but secured not one concrete pledge. The result is that even senior figures at the Bank of England admit that a \"deep and severe recession\" looks increasingly likely, while others talk about a recession that will last for a whole year, with the economy only really recovering by 2011. Yesterday's GDP figures certainly gave no cause for optimism: not only did they show national income falling by far more than most economy-watchers expected, they also revealed that nearly every single part of the economy is in reverse gear. Not just banking but also manufacturing; not only construction but also shops. The only private sector industry to have had a good three months is that tiny corner of the UK economy, farming.</p> <p>No one can seriously argue that this will not be a recession; the question is whether it will be a Labour recession. There are two possible answers to this: one is the purely negative one in which political opponents use this downturn to attack Gordon Brown's economic credentials; the other is the positive one in which ministers try to show off Labour values amid adversity, to display some of the command they have shown in handling the banking bail-out. There was plenty of the negative stuff flying about yesterday, with David Cameron reprising the rather stale Conservative taunt about Mr Brown's claim that he had abolished boom and bust. True, it was vainglorious of the then chancellor to have (repeatedly) left such a hostage to fortune. But attacks are not the same as answers, and the Tories have not provided any convincing proposals on tackling the downturn. Despite the prospect of job losses and repossessions, the battle between the parties over who can better run the economy remains closely fought.</p> <p>Confronted with a recession in the early 1980s, Margaret Thatcher and Geoffrey Howe chose to cut public spending, hike taxes and damn the consequences. The result was record unemployment and a downturn that dragged on. Mr Darling, thankfully, has not gone down this route. Borrowing and spending more during a downturn are the right things to do; so was this week's plan to make repossession the last resort. But ministers also need to be clear about how Britain ended up in this state. Talking about a crisis made in Wall Street is not good enough; more honest would be to admit that the UK is uniquely dependent on finance and consumption, and that this lopsidedness should be corrected. Rather than reinstate the old model, better to use extra spending to create another one: a Green New Deal which tackles our energy shortfall and the problem of climate change. This may be a disaster, but it is also an opportunity.</p>",
  "<p>\"This game has come at a very difficult time in terms of what's happening in the world and I want 100% respect for that,\" Kevin Pietersen said this week, urging England's cricketers to temper their enjoyment of the Twenty20 Stanford Super Series swag-grab, which starts today, with respect for the global credit crunch. </p> <p>There are some thrillingly yeasty forces at work here. International Twenty20 already looks like a peculiar hangover from the pre-crunch world of crazed and unceasing excess, the sporting equivalent of shoving double-handfuls of vintage moose milk cheese into your mouth while shot-gunning a bottle of Ch\u00e2teau Margaux 1953. </p> <p>Mix this together with the stripped-down mechanical idiocy of the Stanford winner-takes-all prize money scheme. Chuck in a financial collapse. And you're left with a sense of some great crisis of the age about to reveal itself, a regression, perhaps, to a prehistoric era of gladiatorial cavemanism. </p> <p>It's nice of KP to think of us right now but really it's the players we should be worried about. Bombarded with Stanford strontium rays, marinated in fiscal meltdown, our cricketers look like guinea pigs in an experiment in the reverse evolution of extreme capitalism. Ape-like, drooling with primal hunger, they're sent forth from the guttering campfire to gorge themselves on the Stanford carcass before the sky closes in. </p> <p>It's a point I raised with KP himself as we took our weekly stroll around the executive garden of his elite riverside apartment block. \"It's a toughie,\" he said with a shrug as we power-walked, arm-in-arm, past the rhododendron beds. \"If you're asking me if I think we're being cast as a troupe of performing semi-primates, de-civilised into sporting cavemen, I'd have to say... ugh!\" </p> <p>\"Oh dear. Dogs. About the credit crunch, though. Do you really think we should be respecting it?\"</p> <p>\"Yeah, well,\" he said, running a hand through surprisingly coarse facial hair. \"We talked about going out and getting in the credit crunch's face, maybe getting involved with some verbals.\" </p> <p>\"I'm so with you,\" I nodded, noticing for the first time his unusually heavy jaw. \"And what about Stanford? Should we be concerned about the cretinising effects of a grunting exercise in chimp-like self-gratification, a base pastiche stripped of all higher meaning, sport re-cast as pornography?\" </p> <p>\"Mate, it's just a question of co-existing alongside a compromised and neo-primitive sporting Leviathan,\" he suggested, picking idly through the shag of my fake fur stole. \"Is that an acorn over there?\"</p> <p>I watched, fondly, as KP crouched in the shrubbery, noting his use of a twig-handled axe to root among the mulch. </p> <p>\"Is there no hope in the Bank of England's talk of a Return To Boredom?\" </p> <p>\"Cooky won't make the XI,\" he said.</p> <p>\"That's not really what I meant. It's just all this primal hunger, the brutalising effects, the regression, the ... Kev?\"</p> <p>But this time he'd gone. Looking up into the plane trees, I caught a final glimpse as he reached the autumn canopy, bandy legs propelling his barrel-shaped torso with unusual agility. Before long he'd disappeared completely. I hope he comes back soon.</p>",
  "<p>Martin O'Neill is to investigate claims that John Carew was in a lap-dancing bar on the morning of Aston Villa's Uefa Cup tie against Ajax on Thursday. It is alleged the Norway international was in the nightclub until the early hours and, if so, is guilty of breaking Villa's pre-match curfew. If the allegations are proved he is likely to be fined two weeks' wages, which equates to about \u00a3100,000.</p> <p>Although O'Neill omitted Carew from the squad that faced Ajax, the Villa manager was not aware of the allegations that he had visited The Rocket Club in Birmingham's Broad Street and was instead responding to the forward's claims earlier in the week that he was suffering from fatigue since returning from international duty. Carew, however, did not learn that he would be rested for the Ajax match, which Villa won 2-1, until the day of the game, meaning that he breached club rules by going out in the city.</p> <p>Although there is no suggestion that the 29-year-old consumed alcohol in the nightclub, O'Neill is unlikely to take a lenient view. He knew nothing of the allegations until yesterday morning but has vowed to take the matter further, with Carew expected to be given the maximum fine and warned as to his future conduct if found guilty.</p> <p>O'Neill had initially indicated Carew would be in contention for tomorrow's match at Wigan Athletic after the blood tests the club had run earlier in the week showed there was nothing untoward, despite the player's concerns that he was feeling tired. However, in the wake of the claims of late-night partying, there remains a strong possibility O'Neill will now jettison him from the squad that travels to the JJB Stadium.</p> <p>Carew, who has been a key figure in Villa's renaissance since he arrived from Lyon last year, has a reputation for enjoying a nocturnal lifestyle at times and having a relaxed approach to training. \"He takes himself off to an outside-left position and stays there, offering no help to anyone,\" joked O'Neill this month.</p> <p>Carew was not available for comment last night and his agent, Per Flod, insisted he had nothing to say in public about the matter.</p> <p>The controversial plan to play top-flight English league matches overseas could still come to fruition, the Premier League chief executive,<strong> Richard Scudamore</strong>, said last night. </p> <p>The so-called\"39th game\" plan, which has drawn criticism from Fifa president Sepp Blatter, was revealed last year with Scudamore calling for an extra round of league fixtures to be played around the globe in cities such as Beijing. He compared the plan to the NFL's decision to stage a regular season game between the New Orleans Saints and San Diego Chargers at Wembley Stadium tomorrow. </p> <p>\"Globalisation of sport is here and this is just the next manifestation of it,\" said Scudamore at a global sports summit.</p> <p>\"We knew the reaction would be somewhat extreme and we knew it was going to be difficult, maybe not quite as difficult, but clearly we have been looking at this for some time.</p> <p>\"It would be ridiculous of me to say the reaction hasn't moved us back to, if not to the drawing board, then certainly the think tank. It has probably pushed the time-lines back.</p> <p>\"But in terms of playing meaningful games abroad, hopefully it will happen within my lifetime, hopefully within my soccer administration career.\"</p> <p>Chelsea's chief executive, Peter Kenyon, said clubs had a duty to support the Premier League in trying to grow its global appeal, although he said the concept of a 39th game still had to be properly worked out. </p> <p>\"The idea of the 39th game got out of the box without a proper rationale or way that it would work,\" he said.</p>",

Some 350 hedge funds have shut down this year.</p> <p>Although a handful of hedge funds have prospered by \"shorting\" banks and mortgage companies to bet on a slump in their fortunes, many highly leveraged, risk-taking investment firms have struggled to cope with unprecedented volatility in the markets.</p> <p>Griffin acknowledged the hedge fund industry's performance had fallen short during a panel discussion at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs this week.</p> <p>\"In this bear market, they don't look that much different than the performance of the underlying indices. This is going to be a great disappointment to investors around the world,\" said Griffin, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Alpha Bank and Trust, a Georgia-based bank, tonight became the 16th US high-street bank to fail this year. Georgia's state authorities shut it down and the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission arranged for a Minnesota bank to take over its $346m (\u00a3217m) of deposits.</p>",
  "<p>Before we get carried away with the idea of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/brettonwoods\">new Bretton Woods conference</a> to remake the global economy, it is worth recalling four facts about what made the original gathering a success.</p> <p>First, the <a href=\"http://www.polsci.ucsb.edu/faculty/cohen/inpress/bretton.html\">original agreement</a> was a response to the shock of the Great Depression and the second world war. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">current shock</a> is severe, to be sure, but not that severe. Even the most pessimistic observers expect \"only\" the deepest recession since the early 1980s, when unemployment in the United States reached 10%, not a depression like that which raised US unemployment to 24% in 1933. And while economic crisis may yet fan geopolitical tensions, no one anticipates repercussions tantamount to the second world war. This crisis has created a willingness to contemplate significant reform, but it is unlikely to support reforms as radical as those reached in 1944.</p> <p>Second, the conference held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire in that year took place after three years of extensive planning under the intellectual leadership of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes in the US and British treasuries. This time, in contrast, treasuries on both sides of the Atlantic have been behind the curve. Advance planning, such as it is, has anticipated events by at most a matter of days.</p> <p>Third, the Bretton Woods conference was a meeting of finance and treasury officials, not heads of state. Heads of state are prone to grand statements, not detailed proposals for economic and financial reform \u2013 Gordon Brown being a rare exception. For substance, as opposed to posturing, we will have to wait for the follow-up conferences attended by specialists.</p> <p>Finally, the conference took place at a time of unquestioned US hegemony over the western alliance and the global economy. America had the intellectual and financial resources with which to drive the reform process. Now it lacks both. In Europe, France and Germany are squabbling over the form and extent of state intervention in the post-crisis world. In Asia, China and Japan are vying uncooperatively for leadership. Beijing responded favourably to Korea's proposal for a regional bail-out fund, but Tokyo deferred, fearing that this would be dominated by China, given that country's immense dollar reserves. Tokyo then proposed funneling Asian reserves through the IMF, but China deferred, fearing that this initiative would be dominated by Japan, which has long participated in IMF deliberations. Financial diplomacy is evidently more difficult than in 1944.</p> <p>So what to do? Countries participating in the series of summits starting on November 15 should concentrate on stabilising financial markets, which is the immediate problem to be solved. There are other pressing global problems, from climate change to poverty and underdevelopment, but adding them to this agenda will only make deliberations wordier and less productive. It is far from clear, for example, that the US will agree to a new international agreement if it has to compromise not just on financial regulation but on global warming, foreign aid, and sundry other issues.</p> <p>Next, move quickly from the leaders' meeting, which is largely about the photo-ops, to the meeting of finance ministers, where the real business will occur. And once there, focus on pragmatic reforms. Clamp down on regulatory <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage\">arbitrage</a>. Raise capital requirements. Make the regulatory regime less <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procyclical\">procyclical</a>. Use taxes and regulation to drive transactions in credit default swaps and other derivative instruments into an organised exchange.</p> <p>This modest approach will not be hailed as a New World Financial Order. But it will be a useful first step toward making the world a safer financial place. And it will minimise the danger that the new Bretton Woods conference will go down in history as a failure.</p>",
  "<p>Fears of an economic slump to rival the recession of the early 1990s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/table/2008/sep/19/ftse100.worst.days\">wiped almost \u00a350bn off the value of Britain's top 100 companies</a> and sent stockmarkets around the world into a tailspin.</p> <p>The wave of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">panic selling</a> in the City followed warnings that the Tiger economies of the far east, which have so far escaped the worst of the global financial crisis, would also see a sharp slowdown in growth.</p> <p>Major continental exchanges plunged by as much as 9% while, in the US, the Dow industrial index slumped more than 3% as traders digested a week of dire warnings, including an unusually frank admission of impending recession from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England governor, Mervyn King</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">Banks</a> again led the downward trend led by HSBC and Standard Chartered, both with extensive operations in Asia. But all leading shares lost value with little sign of the situation stabilising over the next few weeks.</p> <p>In Japan, Sony warned that demand for consumer electronics was down and its analysis was echoed by Korea's Samsung. Profit warnings from the two firms worked to drag down the value of rival electronics groups Philips and US stock market darling Apple along with UK retailer Currys, which lost 15% of its value. </p> <p>In Paris, Air France warned of lower profits, sending its shares on the Paris exchange down by almost 10%. </p> <p>Data from the Office for National Statistics showing that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/economicgrowth-recession\">national income shrank for the first time in 16 years</a> by 0.5% between July and September was blamed for much of the stockmarket decline. </p> <p>Britain was the first of the seven most-developed industrialised nations to publish economic data for the period and some economists said they expected the other nations to also report similar declines in economic output.</p> <p>\"This is going to be a long-drawn-out downturn of about five quarters of negative growth and there will be very few major economies that will escape recession,\" said James Knightley, an economist at ING Financial Markets in London. </p> <p>\"With asset values falling, real incomes down and corporate profits declining we can see a real drop in investments and the government is in no position to help.\"</p> <p>The figures confirmed comments earlier this week by the prime minister, Gordon Brown, that a recession was likely. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said on Wednesday that Britain's economy would suffer more than other major industrialised countries because of a combination of rising household and public debt, a sharp fall in consumer spending and decline in house prices.</p> <p>Richard Hunter of stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown said bank shares would continue to suffer while investors waited to see the full impact of a recession on their fortunes. He said large rises in arrears and repossessions were expected as unemployment rises and a squeeze on family incomes tightens over Christmas. </p> <p>Royal Bank of Scotland slumped 9% to little more than 60p a share while HBOS dived 15% to settle at 59.8p. Both banks, which expect to be partially nationalised by the government, have seen 90% of their value wiped out since a peak early last year.</p> <p>HSBC and Standard Chartered were considered safe havens until Asian nations signalled they were also expecting hard times ahead. India cut interest rates to stimulate the country's flagging economy. In South Korea, the Kospi plummeted 10.6%, falling 1,000 points and heading for a total decline this year of more than 50%.</p> <p>On Wall Street, stocks fell sharply within minutes of the opening bell, but fears of a dramatic collapse to match the banking crisis of a fortnight ago were allayed as the Dow reached midday with a relatively modest drop of 3.5%. </p> <p>Although distressed hedge funds continue to dump stock, traders suggested there was evidence of bargain-hunting among investors as US shares began to look cheap. </p> <p>There was a glimmer of economic relief in data showing a 5.5% rise in US home purchases during August. The National Association of Realtors suggested that in terms of sales, the depressed property market appeared to have bottomed out. </p> <p>On the stockmarket, big losers included the ailing motor industry. General Motors' shares slumped by 13% on fresh rumours, hotly denied by the company, that it could file for bankruptcy. </p> <p>The US government revealed the extent of changing habits among motorists with figures revealing that the distance driven by Americans dropped by 5.6% during August, a fall of 15bn miles. </p> <p>Energy companies suffered a pounding as the price of a barrel of crude oil reached a 17-month low. Chevron's shares dropped by 6% during early trading while ExxonMobil slipped 3.2%. </p> <p>The US government said the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, was \"monitoring\" the markets. </p> <p>A White House spokesman, Tony Fratto, said: \"Markets are trying to digest lots of new information - both changing economic conditions, as well as official policy responses, and it will take time for conditions to settle.\"</p>",
  "<p>Amid the fevered media fascination that has surrounded Sarah Palin since she was plucked from the decent obscurity of Alaska to become John McCain's running mate at the end of August, one theme has remained constant: that she has and will shore up and even increase the vote of the religious right on November 4. Palin has fostered it herself, most recently <a href=\"http://www.citizenlink.org/clspecialalert/A000008476.cfm\">going on James Dobson's show</a> to pal around with the evangelicals who are <a href=\"http://www.focusonthefamily.com/\">Focus on the Family</a>'s target audience \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.focusonthefamily.com/about_us/profiles/dr_james_dobson.aspx\">Dobson</a> himself being the self-regarding Svengali of the religious right.</p> <p>But on October 23 the Washington-based <a href=\"http://pewforum.org/about/\">Pew Forum</a> issued some <a href=\"http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=364\">polling findings</a> which, hidden in the graphs, show that the Palin effect may be pretty limited among the religious constituency too. Its figures show that indeed white, evangelical Protestant voters are still heavily supportive of McCain over Obama, by a margin of about two-thirds to a quarter. But the proportion has scarcely changed, indeed has possibly declined marginally, since Palin's epiphany on August 29.</p> <p>In polls since June, McCain's rating among the group has wavered from 61% to peak at 74% (bizarrely, recorded in the second week of October just as the Republican candidate's rating subsided following the Wall Street crisis) before currently settling at about 67%. But at the end of August the rating was running at 71%. In other words, the selection of Palin does not seem to have boosted McCain's support. The long standing suspicion of McCain among evangelicals does not seem to have drastically affected his support from that quarter or changed it much since Palin's selection, though it is running significantly lower than the 78% rating that George Bush achieved in the 2004 election.</p> <p>Given Palin's open and ostentatious appeal to that section of the electorate, she doesn't actually seem to have made much difference to its voting intentions. And that's despite her rightwing groupies' increasingly vociferous claims that she is the victim of a media witch hunt because of her values and homespun God-fearin' characteristics. As I write this, just such a missive has flopped into the Guardian's letters in-tray: anonymous, semi-literate and all in capitals, denouncing a \"flagrant smear and assassination agenda against Sarah Palin [by] columnists for the enemies of my country here and abroad.\" The same post has also gone to the New York Times. It might have more luck with Fox News.</p> <p>What may be true is that by enthusing the religious base, Palin's selection may have increased their chances of voting at all. As Dr Richard Land, premier spokesman in Washington DC of the <a href=\"http://www.sbc.net/\">Southern Baptist Convention</a> tells me, McCain himself would not have been even the Religious Right's second choice candidate for the Republican nomination, but Palin has revived their enthusiasm. Dobson, who earlier in the year said he could not endorse McCain has enthusiastically embraced his vice-presidential candidate (purely platonically of course) and so her place on the ticket probably ensures that many evangelicals do indeed turn out to vote. But her selection has come at a terrible cost in the wider electorate.</p> <p>By comparison, Obama's approval rating among white evangelicals has been pretty constant: 25% in June, 24% now, recovering from 18% earlier in the month. But among other religious groups he's not been doing badly at all: among mainstream white Protestant voters he's currently leading by 48% to 43% \u2013 more or less in line with general polls \u2013 and he's also ahead by 49% to 41% among Hispanic Catholics. Here's a surprise too: among black Protestant registered voters he is running at 94% to McCain's 2%. And among unaffiliated voters \u2013 not connected to any religious group \u2013 he is at 66% to 24%.</p> <p>The figures indicate that the white evangelicals \u2013 roughly 23% of the electorate \u2013 are McCain's most loyal constituency, wielding an influence out of proportion even to their numbers because they reliably turn out and vote in elections. But the vote is not as solid as it was four years ago, the evangelical movement has been riven by divisions over the environment as part of a growing debate about political aims and objectives and even churchgoers are not immune to economic concerns. Also, Palin has not had the transformative effect McCain's team had hoped. There has not been a barracuda bounce.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">The Bank of England</a> has come under pressure to slash interest rates after new figures showed the economy had contracted for the first time in 16 years as it heads into recession.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/marketturmoil-creditcrunch1\">The news hammered the FTSE 100 index</a>, which lost as much as 9% of its value at one point, wiping \u00a390bn off the value of leading shares. It also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">clobbered the pound</a> which suffered its biggest fall against the dollar since 1992, to below $1.53, a six-year low.</p> <p>As recently as July, the pound would buy $2 but it has been falling rapidly on growing evidence that the economy is slumping. The pound also hit a record low against the euro of just under 82p, which means dearer foreign holidays for Britons.</p> <p>Official data showed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/recession-economists\">gross domestic product</a> contracted by 0.5% in the July to September period, which was much bigger than expected. It was the first fall since early 1992 and the biggest drop since the fourth quarter of 1990.</p> <p>\"It's a big shock that the decline is so large. It is truly dire,\" said Philip Shaw, the chief economist at Investec.</p> <p>Barring a miraculous bounce in the current quarter, the economy will fulfil the technical definition of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2008/oct/24/recession-mpc-interest-rates\">recession</a> as two quarters of contraction. Economists expect at least four more quarters of shrinkage in a row, which would be as bad as the recessions of the early 1990s and early 1980s.</p> <p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, said he was confident the British economy would get through this \"difficult period\" and reaffirmed the government's commitment to help individuals and businesses. \"If we do that, I'm confident that we along with other countries will get through this difficult period,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I've lived through the recessions this country saw in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. The difference is, this time we are determined to do everything we can and as soon as we can to help people so that if they lose their jobs they can get back into work, that if businesses get into difficulty we do our level best to help them.\"</p> <p>His words following an acknowledgement from the prime minister, Gordon Brown, and the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, earlier this week that recession was inevitable as a result of the global credit crisis and collapsing house prices.</p> <p>Shadow chancellor George Osborne dubbed it \"a defining moment in the record of Gordon Brown\" and said millions of British families \"are in for a very difficult time in the months ahead.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The day that we can all see that the central claims he made over 10 years, that he had abolished boom and bust and therefore didn't need to set aside money for a rainy day has been shown to be completely false.\"</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) data showed the fall in national output was widespread, with only agriculture and government services still growing. </p> <p>Statisticians said the biggest falls were in areas such as financial services and in manufacturing and construction, the latter hit by a slump in house building.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, warned that the UK was \"on the edge of a new winter of discontent\".</p> <p>\"This confirmation that we are heading for a recession puts a name to the fear that many people have been feeling for months,\" he said. \"These growth figures show that the credit crunch is hitting the real economy and harder and faster than was first feared.\"</p> <p>The Bank of England's deputy governor, Charles Bean, warned the economic slump was still in its early stages as a result of \"possibly the largest financial crisis of its kind in human history\", adding that he hoped the worst of the crisis was now past.</p> <p>But the ONS figures largely relate to the period before the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers in mid-September that led to the financial maelstrom of the past few weeks.</p> <p>Economists said the current quarter and all of 2009 could see falling output and urged the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) to add to this month's half-point rate cut which took the bank rate down to 4.5%.</p> <p>\"My comment to traders was 'dive, dive, dive',\" said Brian Hilliard, an economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in London. \"It's a very emphatic entry into recession which underlines the need for very dramatic interest rate cuts which we think the Bank of England will deliver.\"</p> <p>Speculation is growing in the City that the MPC could deliver its biggest cut in interest rates to date \u2013 by one percentage point to 3.5% \u2013 at its next meeting on November 6, or that it could hold an emergency meeting next week to cut rates, such is the gravity of the situation. </p> <p>The TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber, said: \"Urgent action should start with a cut in interest rates by the Bank to below 3%. The newly unemployed should be given more help by reversing cuts in Jobcentre Plus staff, increasing statutory redundancy pay and lifting the amount of redundancy pay that can be taken tax free. </p> <p>\"Recent action to help homeowners facing repossession is welcome, but more will need to be done.\"</p> <p>Shares fell sharply around the world today on fears that many other countries would follow Britain into recession as the credit crunch stunts growth everywhere. </p> <p>The Chinese president, Hu Jintao, said in Beijing that the outlook for the Chinese economy \u2013 until recently touted as the one that would continue to drive the world economy forward \u2013 was \"grim and complicated\".</p>",

  "<p>Shares on Wall Street and London plunged today as world stockmarkets suffered another rout amid growing fears of a deep and protracted global recession. </p> <p>The Dow Jones fell by nearly 300 points this afternoon, with banks, energy companies, tech firms and airlines all seeing double digit percentage falls in a chaotic opening few minutes of trading. </p> <p>\"We are getting used to wild swings in the markets, but today's moves verge on the bizarre,\" said Julian Jessop, the chief international economist at Capital Economics, referring to steep falls across European stock markets. </p> <p>In the City, almost \u00a350bn was wiped off the value of Britain's biggest companies as the FTSE suffered another steep drop after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/recession-economicgrowth\">the UK economy suffered a shock decline</a>. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 closed down 5%, losing 204 points to finish at 3883. </p> <p>There were also heavy losses in Europe as Germany's Dax index fell by 5.4% Germany and France's CAC40 closed down 3.9%. </p> <p>Stockmarket jitters in Europe spread to trading in Dow Jones futures, which had to be suspended several times because of the weight of heavy selling before Wall Street opened. </p> <p>By 2.45pm, the Dow had dropped to 8288, a 400-point fall that one market commentator described as \"beyond volatile\", although the index clawed back some of its losses by 5pm and was down by 282 points. </p> <p>In London, traders dumped shares when the market opened and continued selling as the bad news kept coming. At one stage, the FTSE 100 had tumbled by more than 9%, or 372 points, to 3715 - its lowest point in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">the current crisis</a>, before it staged a late recovery. </p> <p>\"I sense we've moved beyond the credit crisis. There's a recognition of the damage inflicted on the global economy, that is the recession, by the credit crisis,\" said Mike Lenhoff, at stockbroker Brewin Dolphin. \"It's not just limited to the developed world. You can run but you can't hide anywhere.\" </p> <p>The mood was not helped by further weakening of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">the pound, which slumped to a five and a half-year low against the dollar</a> after the Office for National Statistics reported that UK GDP shrank by 0.5% in the third quarter. </p> <p>Rumours swept the City that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/generalmotors\">General Motors</a> might go bust, or that America might suspend trading on Wall Street for a week, although it was not clear how seriously these were being treated.</p> <p>As with Wall Street, banks led the FTSE 100 fallers, with HBOS plunging 17%, and Standard Chartered, HSBC and Barclays all down 10%. The London Stock Exchange, Prudential and Aviva also suffered double-digit declines and not a single share was in positive territory.</p> <p>Oil cartel Opec added to the gloom by cutting oil production by less than some analysts had hoped.</p> <p>David Jones, chief market strategist at IG Index, said that traders were alarmed by the 0.5% drop in UK GDP which has crushed any hopes that the worst of the crisis might be over.</p> <p>\"It's as if the banking crisis took everyone's eyes off the real economy, and now the markets have looked back and they don't like what they see,\" said Jones. \"The recession is going to be much worse than expected.\"</p> <p>Manus Cranny, spokesman for MF Global Spreads, said that the City was dealing with \"a heady cocktail\" of speculation, but that the underlying factor is the weakness of the UK economy.</p> <p>\"Today, the Footsie is saying that 'yes, we truly believe that a recession is definitely happening'. Anyone who thinks that this could be a short, shallow recession, because of the use of instruments like interest rates, is seriously deluded,\" Cranny said.</p> <p><strong>Panic selling in Asia</strong></p> <p>The latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">global selloff</a> began in Asia overnight, where Japan's Nikkei index fell by almost 10% on the back of a shock profits warning from Sony.</p> <p>The Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, issued a grim warning at a meeting of 27 EU member states and 16 Asian nations.</p> <p>\"The global financial crisis has been constantly spreading and worsening, creating a severe shock to global economic growth,\" he said.</p> <p>And underlining the scale of the problems facing the UK, Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean said it could be the worst financial crisis ever.</p> <p>\"This is a once in a lifetime crisis, and possibly the largest financial crisis of its kind in human history,\" he said.</p> <p>The UK economy was widely expected to have shrunk in the third quarter of 2008, but few analysts had predicted such a steep drop. Christian Gattiker, head of research and equity strategy at Julius Baer, who had predicted a 0.5% decline, warned this morning that the financial crisis means the UK faces \"quite a bleak outlook\".</p> <p>In Japan the Nikkei plunged by 9.6%, or 811.9 points, to 7649.08. It has now lost half its value in the last 12 months. Tech stocks led the fallers on the back of Sony's admission that the strong yen is damaging its exports and that it is seeing less demand for electronics products. Its shares fell by 14% today. </p> <p>The yen has risen sharply against other currencies, hitting a 13-year high against the US dollar today.</p> <p>South Korea saw even greater falls, with the Korean Composite Index down by 10.5%. The sell-off was fuelled by a grim trading statement from Samsung. The electronics giant posting a 44% drop in earnings after prices of its flat-screen displays and memory chips fell.</p> <p>\"We foresee the coming months to be an even more challenging period,\" warned Chu Woo-sik, a Samsung spokesman.</p>",
  "<p><strong>WOOD: WE'RE NOT GOOD</strong></p> <p>Like the survival prospects of a laboratory mouse fed ball-bearings, trapped under a wooden cage and placed next to a 200-tonne electromagnet, it's not looking good for Spurs. The predictable defeat against Udinese last night has cranked up the pressure on Juande Ramos ahead of the weekend's Premier League programme. At least the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2008/oct/22/ramos-tottenham-gallery?picture=338883446\">Bobby Ewing/Lovejoy/Kate Winslet lookalike</a> can rely on his senior players for support. What's that? One of his senior players has unfavourably compared Tottenham to the club synonymous with complete footballing disaster? British football's biggest train-wreck club of the 21st century? The club that stands as an object lesson in avarice and self-destruction? Oh dear.</p> <p>\"I have seen it before at Leeds,\" said Jonathan Woodgate, who, of course, had jumped ship to Newcastle long before Leeds started their sink to the ocean floor (well, not quite the ocean floor, more a deep-sea ledge about three quarters of the way down that provides a convenient aquatic analogy for League One). \"We had a better team at Leeds than we have now and they went down eventually. We have got to really roll our sleeves up now and start grafting because it is going to be hard.\" </p> <p>But Woodgate, despite his pessimistic point of view, doesn't go far enough. In 2003 Leeds had eight points from their first eight games - Tottenham have two. So Spurs aren't just worse than that relegated Leeds side, they're worse than the Wolves team of 2004 (who had mustered five points by this stage) who finished bottom. They're worse than the Nottingham Forest team who finished at the foot in the very first Premier League table in 1992-93. They're worse than the Swindon Town team that set a new benchmark for top-flight uselessness a season later. They're much, much worse than the Watford team that fared so miserably in 1999-2000. They're worse than Peter Reid's Sunderland side of 2002-03. And, whisper it, so far they're even worse than last season's Derby County. </p> <p>In short, they've made the crummiest opening since the Fiver tried to win that bet about the number of custard creams it could stick up ... well, since ages. And there's little prospect of improvement in the short term. It took a Steed Malbranque equaliser to rescue a draw for Spurs against Bolton at White Hart Lane last season and Wanderers' last trip to London ended with a 3-1 win at West Ham earlier this month. After Bolton it's Arsenal (a), Liverpool (h), Dinamo Zagreb (h), Man City (a) and Liverpool (h), one of the stickiest runs since the day after the Fiver tried to win that bet about the custard creams. Woodgate is a doubt for Sunday's set-to with Gary Megson's side, with groin-gah picked up against Udinese, although if he recovers from that he may still face the letting-his-gob-run-away-with-him-knack that saw David Bentley unceremoniously dropped in Italy.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTES OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"If you assess what I did over the course of the season, I think I did more than everyone. What else should I have done to win the Ballon d'Or and the Fifa award?\" - Cristiano Ronaldo wants all the awards going this year, and if he doesn't he'll ... oh, he doesn't know yet, but he'll do something, possibly involving holding his breath, and then you'll see! You'll all see!</p> <p>\"It is forgotten, not only for January but forever\" - Real Madrid suit Ramon Calderon suddenly decides Ronaldo is more trouble than he is worth, and he is worth quite a lot.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE LOWEST POINT; POINT OF GREATEST ADVERSITY OR DESPAIR</strong></p> <p>It shows the sorry state football has got itself into these days when Peter Kenyon appears to be the sole voice of sanity, but that is where we found ourselves today. If you want a dictionary definition of nadir, there it is, right there. Anyway, Kenyon was speaking at the Global Sports Summit, some industry seminar or other populated by hundreds of marketing experts, business gurus, geeks, clowns and eejits, none of whom will have ever stood on a terrace in their whole sorry lives, all of them winging it. The dismal topic of discussion? Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, and what a clueless goon the man is. Sort of.</p> <p>\"The globalisation of sport is here to stay,\" Scudamore had announced earlier in the morning, it presumably being beyond his ken that, as one of the men controlling football, it is within his power to stop it happening to his particular sport if he so desires. Unless he is being totally disingenuous, which the Fiver is sure he is not. \"We knew the reaction to the 39th game proposals would be somewhat extreme and we knew it was going to be difficult,\" continued Scudamore, giving a clear admission that he knows full well nobody wants a Game 39, before ploughing on regardless anyway.</p> <p>\"It would be ridiculous to say the reaction has not pushed us back if not to the drawing board, then certainly the think tank,\" wittered the suit. \"It has probably pushed the timelines back. In terms of playing meaningful games abroad, hopefully it will happen within my lifetime, hopefully within my soccer administration career. If we do anything internationally then 20 clubs will benefit from that.\" At which point Kenyon came charging in to counter: \"The 39th game just came out of the box without a rationale or mechanic defined for it. Going back to the fan experience, nobody wanted it to happen and you have got to listen to that.\" Kenyon gets enough pelters for his ridiculous free-marketeering, so credit where credit's due for him getting off the fence over this one.</p> <p>Speaking of credit where credit's due, Scudamore did at least promise not to tamper with the concept of promotion and relegation, so he probably deserves some for allowing us that small mercy. Although we're not going to give any to him.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>WIN, LOSE OR SCORE</strong></p> <p><strong>Guardian Fantasy Football</strong><br>Go on, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fantasyfootball\">play it</a>.</p> <p><strong>Guardian Pick the Score</strong><br>Go on, <a href=\"http://guardian.pickthescore.co.uk/\">pick it</a>.</p> <p><strong>Guardian Soulmates</strong><br>Go on, <a href=\"http://dating.theguardian.com/s/\">find one</a>.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Rangers are after Sporting Lisbon defender Tonel, according to this, er, clipping.</p> <p>Xabi Alonso, having embarrassed himself by suggesting Liverpool will end Chelsea's 385-year unbeaten run at Stamford Bridge, is off to hide his shame in Barcelona.</p> <p>Manchester City want.

HAS IT COME TO THIS? </strong></p>",
  "<p>The current global financial crisis has clearly underlined the need for more effective mechanisms of international cooperation. The stumbling initial response of the G7 risked prolonging the credit crunch. Today, while panic has eased somewhat in wealthy countries, the crisis is spilling into developing countries, with potentially devastating effects. Yet there is no coordinated effort to address the problems faced by emerging markets.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/globaleconomy-g8\">Jeffrey Sachs argues</a>, a Bretton Woods II may be necessary to build a new global financial and economic system. In fact, the multilateral, cooperative spirit of Bretton Woods is urgently needed today. If the crisis only deepens the divide between haves and have-nots, it is difficult to see how an international summit could be successful. And at the top of today's agenda must be saving the <a href=\"http://24carat.co.uk/eurozoneframe.html\">eurozone</a>.</p> <p>Last week's coordinated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/16/ubs-creditsuisse\">bank recapitalisations</a> helped calm the panic in the wealthiest European countries, but there are signs that the problem has been stamped out in one place only to resurface in another. Most ominously, expectations are rising that some European governments will default on their debts. During the last three months, the implied risk that Ireland, Italy and Greece will default within five years \u2013 based on credit default swap spreads for their sovereign debt \u2013 has quadrupled from approximately 3% to 12% each. </p> <p>So far, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap\">credit default swaps</a> (CDSs) have correctly predicted the spread of risk from mortgage-backed securities, to consumer lenders and investment banks, then to commercial banks. Now they are pointing to some of the wealthiest sovereign nations. </p> <p>This is only logical. In many European nations, banks have amassed more debt than taxpayers can afford to repay. These liabilities need to be refinanced periodically, but the current crisis has made that more difficult. In addition, bank debt was largely used to buy assets based on real property that is falling in value. In a severe recession, that decline could render much of the European financial sector insolvent.</p> <p>This is all old news. However, by guaranteeing their systematically important financial institutions, European governments assumed that risk themselves. For example, the Irish announced they would guarantee all liabilities of their major banks \u2013 over 3 times current GDP and over 12 times government revenues. ING's assets equal 2.9 times Holland's GDP at \u20ac1.3tn; the recent recapitalisation provides \u20ac10bn of new capital, or just 0.8% of total assets. If asset values fall sharply, much more capital will be required. Can these countries afford to support all of their core financial institutions? This is the question markets are starting to focus on. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/asia.htm\">1997-98 emerging markets crisis</a> showed how such conditions can lead to collapse. A country finds that its creditors are increasingly reluctant to hold its bonds due to perceived risk. Interest rates on that nation's debt rise, making the debt harder to pay off. To win back confidence, the country needs to tighten fiscal policy, but this can be politically difficult. Fear grows that, instead, the country will inflate its debt away or default outright; rates rise further. The prophecy is ultimately self-fulfilling: fear of a collapse leads to collapse.</p> <p>The standard policy prescription is to tighten fiscal policy and let the exchange rate depreciate sharply. This raises exports, reduces imports and improves national savings. </p> <p>The problem, however, is that eurozone nations no longer have control over their monetary policy, the European Central Bank (ECB) does, and its mandate is to maintain a 2% inflation target. Troubled countries, including Greece, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Portugal, will prefer loose monetary policies, but are sure to be opposed by the Germans (and French) who insist on the low inflation target. Threatened countries will be forced to tighten their belts using fiscal policy and brace for a deep recession. This will be politically painful. </p> <p>If there is a sufficiently deep, global recession, the eurozone may not survive. Countries threatened by default will question the merits of the euro; they will suffer high interest rates, negating one of its expected benefits, and will see other nations as benefiting at their expense. Nationalist politicians will argue that they are better off setting policy at home, echoing Iceland's cry: \"every country for itself.\" The costs of abandoning the euro would be very high, but it could happen, given domestic political instability and intransigence within the eurozone. If one nation breaks away, investors will wonder who is next, cutting off financing from other countries. Contracts in euros will need to be abrogated, causing untold dislocation. The damage will be enormous. <br> However, there is a good chance this scenario can be avoided, if some difficult decisions are taken now before markets demand them through higher interest rates. At the least, failure to act now will require more expensive measures to be taken deeper into the crisis. </p> <p>First, policy makers must generate confidence that they understand and are dealing with these dangers. The ECB's insistence on high interest rates has damaged its credibility. Recent joint efforts by governments, along with the 0.5 percentage point interest rate cut, are steps in the right direction. </p> <p>Second, there need to be mechanisms to ensure that investors who bet against national solvency will lose money. To date, those investors are doing extremely well. We need to discourage such bets and cut the potentially self-fulfilling cycles of higher interest rates that lead to insolvency. </p> <p>We recommend the following steps for the eurozone: </p> <p>1. Lower the ECB base rate now to 2% from the current 3.75%. The coming global recession will dramatically reduce inflation pressures, and a rate cut is needed to offset the recession. Lower rates will help recapitalize banks by making their lending more profitable, and will allow them to charge less to mortgage holders. The 2% inflation target should not be abandoned but should be subordinated to the need for financial stability (without which there will likely be deflation down the road).</p> <p>2. Create a European Stability Fund with at least \u20ac2tn of credit lines guaranteed by all Eurozone member nations and potentially other European countries with large financial systems such as Switzerland, Sweden and the UK. This fund should provide alternative financing to member countries in case market rates on their government debt become too high. This will prevent a self-fulfilling cycle of rising interest rates. The fund should be large enough to have credibility; countries could access the fund automatically, but should then adopt a 5-year program for ensuring financial stability, subject to peer review within the Eurozone.</p> <p>3. All eurozone nations should launch temporary fiscal expansions of at least 1% of GDP. These plans should be aimed at reducing the severity of the upcoming recession and assisting people at risk of default on mortgages or other financial instruments, thereby helping people in trouble and reducing default rates in the financial sector. </p> <p>4. The EU and Switzerland should develop a financial regulatory framework that recognises that systemically important institutions may need to be bailed out by Europe as a whole. One goal should be to reduce extreme differences in national financial risk and leverage so that these problems are less likely to reoccur. </p> <p>These measures will not resolve all of Europe's problems. The coming recession is likely to be severe, and its impact will vary greatly across the eurozone. Some domestic politicians will argue against having one currency for such a diverse area. However, it would be far more costly to abandon the euro now than to keep it. Ultimately, to make good on last week's promise to support all core financial institutions, the eurozone must also promise to support all of its member nations. Otherwise the eurozone may become fragmented and the benefits of the euro will be lost.<br><em><br>This article was written by Simon Johnson, Peter Boone and James Kwak.</em></p> <p><em>Peter Boone is chairman of Effective Intervention, a UK-based charity, and a research associate at the Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics. </em></p> <p><em>Simon Johnson is a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. </em></p> <p><em>James Kwak is a student at Yale Law School.

  "<p>The airline industry's woes deepened today as it posted its biggest drop in passenger numbers in five years and Ryanair abandoned a Spanish base in a row over costs. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/theairlineindustry\">Aviation</a> has been a harbinger of the global downturn after record oil prices forced more then 30 airlines into bankruptcy this year. The latest traffic figures from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) indicate a global downturn is turning the screw.</p> <p>Global traffic fell 2.9% last month in the most significant deterioration since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003, according to IATA. Giovanni Bisignani, the IATA chief executive, said the \"alarmingly fast-paced and widespread\" fall in demand could result in the industry posting a deeper loss than the $5.2bn (\u00a33.3bn) deficit expected for this year.</p> <p>Crippling fuel costs have grounded a number of UK-based carriers including Silverjet and Zoom, but a global recession now poses a greater threat to even the biggest airlines as passenger demand slumps. Air France-KLM, the world's largest airline by revenues, issued a profit warning today after admitting it would be \"very difficult\" to reach its \u20ac1bn operating profit target.</p> <p>\"The industry crisis is deepening along with the crisis in the global economy,\" said Bisignani. \"The worst is likely still to come. We will have a very difficult year.\" </p> <p>IATA said the passenger load factor, or the proportion of seats sold per flight, had fallen from 78.8% to 74.8% - confirming some analysts' fears that the industry remains bloated with too many airplanes catering for a dwindling passenger base. </p> <p>\"Falling load factors show that the industry has too much capacity. The issue is whether the industry can cut capacity fast enough to keep up fares - against a declining market,\" said Chris Tarry, the chairman of the CTAIRA consultancy.</p> <p>IATA recently predicted a two-year recession in the airline industry, with carriers expected to report a combined loss of $9.3bn in 2008-09. According to its September figures, traffic fell by nearly 7% in the Asia/Pacific region compared with the same month last year and declined 0.5% in Europe, with the world's largest market, north America, falling by 0.9%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ryanair\">Ryanair</a>, the world's biggest airline in terms of international flights, announced its withdrawal from Valencia airport today after its owners refused to subsidise its marketing campaigns. Michael Cawley, Ryanair's deputy chief executive, said the removal of the airline's two planes from the Spanish airport would cost the regional economy about 750 jobs. \"This is a very black day for the airport of Valencia and the city and region which it serves,\" said Cawley. </p> <p>Analysts said Ryanair's withdrawal from Valencia - its first ever base closure - underlined the pressure on airlines to keep down costs amid faltering consumer demand. Under Ryanair's business model, it must sell more than eight out 10 seats per flight and relies on low fares to achieve this. However, as the economy weakens, so does consumer demand, resulting in pressure to reduce fares in order to stimulate sales.</p> <p>\"They are clearly pushing very hard on every cost line and demanding cuts in operating costs at airports where they believe there is leverage,\" said Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>However, Lobbenberg said Ryanair's clash with Valencia might be enough to wring concessions from other airport owners. \"It is probably useful for Ryanair to cancel a few airports just to lend credibility to their threats to the others,\" he said. </p> <p>The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O'Leary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/10/ryanair-theairlineindustry\">told the Guardian</a> this month that the airline was braced for a depression lasting up to five years. He admitted that many of Ryanair's leisure passengers would be deterred from travelling, affecting up to 40% of its customer base, but warned competitors that Ryanair would make up the customer loss by winning passengers from other airlines.</p>",
  "<p>It is a delight to have Fred Pearce's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/greenwash\">new Greenwash column</a> starting over on the environment site. Not just because Pearce (who I've known for about 20 years) always brings a forensic, perception-changing approach to environmental matters; but also because there're so many rich pickings for us to provide him with from the computing industry. Hell, on our own we could probably give him enough claims to fill the column for the first year.</p> <p>What sort of things? Well, first of all there's the underlying assumption that chucking away your old computer or data centre in favour of something newer is going to be more \"environmental\". Thus Apple <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macbook/environment.html\">touted its new portable computers last week as its greenest-ever</a> \u2013 \"highly recyclable and even more energy efficient\". OK, but that's relative, isn't it? Carved from a block of aluminium they may be (watch the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macbook/\">video</a>), but that aluminium probably wasn't made by collecting discarded kitchen foil; it'll have been extracted as bauxite, and <a href=\"http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/extraction/aluminium.html\">then turned into aluminium blocks</a>, which in energy-intensity rivals running a particle collider. So they're \"greener\" if you don't mind all the fossil fuels burnt to extract the contents and put them together. (I'm assuming the bauxite mines and smelters aren't powered by windmills \u2013 though Norway is a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=norway+aluminium+&amp;btnG=Search\">favoured location for aluminium smelting</a> because of its plentiful, and green, hydroelectric sources.)</p> <p>I've also enjoyed the past 18 months or so in which Dell has tried to transform itself into a \"green\" company. The most amusing part has been its \"Plant a tree for me\" plan, which tries \u2013 apparently not hard enough \u2013 to persuade people buying a new computer to purchase carbon offsetting, in the form of one-third of a tree planted per machine, for its first three years. The prices aren't high \u2013 \u00a31 per laptop, \u00a33 per desktop \u2013 but people aren't biting. The best numbers I can calculate, based on what the company doles out, is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/oct/02/dell.greentech\">less than 1% of purchased machines are offset</a>. </p> <p>The point is that Dell does seem to me to understand the need to reduce its impact on the environment. Todd Arbogast, its director of sustainable business, explained that Dell's headquarters in Round Rock, Texas, is powered by a mixture of wind, solar and \"methane capture\" sources, and it is pushing its suppliers to use more renewable sources of energy, and recycle more. All laudable aims; it's only a pity that its customers don't seem to share them.</p> <p>There's plenty more, of course. Is it really \"green\" to use cloud computing? You might think so \u2013 after all, it's all happening somewhere else, isn't it? \u2013 but if you consider that it means your computer is running, as well as lots of other computers all over the world, then it doesn't. Nick Carr, author of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jan/03/computing.internet\">The Big Switch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/12/avatars_consume.php\">calculated</a> a while back that each avatar in Second Life, for example, has a carbon footprint as big as the average Brazilian \u2013 and that's in <em>addition</em> to their real-world personae, who probably aren't Brazilian, but American.</p> <p>Or the more recent case, <a href=\"http://blog.hackingcough.com/2008/10/all-aboard-the.htm\">noted</a> by technology journalist Chris Edwards, of a company spotted by the consultancy Ovum which, in Edwards's words, found that \"when it came to their [carbon] footprint, some were forced to wear supersized carbon clown shoes: 'One of the delegates, who had travelled from D\u00fcsseldorf to Amsterdam, had been told that he had to fly there as it was not company policy to reimburse train fares \u2013 despite the fact that in this case there is no direct air service and flying was both considerably more expensive and slower! As this journey involved two relatively short flights, the fuel consumption per passenger was probably about 10 times that of the rail option.'\"</p> <p>Ah, yes, the manifold ways in which we can be tripped up by our own good intentions. </p> <p>But the question behind it all \u2013 and which the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/economicgrowth-recession\">latest economic news</a> might make us consider even more carefully \u2013 is: why do you need a \"new\" anything? Isn't there enough computer equipment in your home or business to do what you need? Isn't the real solution to speeding things up or making work easier actually in the software, not the hardware? I suspect that the coming year is going to see some dramatic slowdowns in spending (Gartner has already <a href=\"http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2008/10/14/gartner_slashes_2009_it_spending_forecast/\">slashed its forecasts</a> for 2009) and a lot of reevaluation. The question, \"Why do you want that again?\" is a good one when it comes to hardware. Because the nice thing with software is that it's completely green: you're just reusing the electrons in the wires and magnetic domains on the hard drive. Now that's what I call green.</p>",
  "<p>If you had to choose the region of Britain under greatest pressure from the global demand for food it would have to be <a href=\"http://www.visiteastofengland.com/explore/default.aspx\">eastern England</a>. Ever since the second world war this landscape of big skies and broad, featureless farmlands has been the epicentre of high-input industrial agriculture.</p> <p>So it's no surprise that the region is starting to show signs of strain. A new report from the <a href=\"http://www.rase.org.uk/\">Royal Agricultural Society of England</a> (RASE) warns that deteriorating soil quality could render some parts of the country unfit for productive farming. Eastern England, with its intensive cropping for fruit and vegetables, is highlighted as a likely candidate.</p> <p>The team of leading soil scientists who wrote the report are calling for more government-backed research on food production and less on environmental protection. A good starting point might be a new national centre for soil and water management, says the report. It should look urgently at how our soils are going to adapt to climate change. Without this research, we're likely to face increased flooding and static or falling crop yields.</p> <p>As one who studied soil science along with agriculture in the 1960s, I find myself in total sympathy with this clarion call. Back in the 60s, when food shortages in western industrial countries were still imaginable, the study of soils was seen as a vital branch of science. In today's world of genetic manipulation and molecular biology, it sounds almost Victorian. The very phrase soil science conjures up pictures of brass microscopes and mahogany work-benches littered with reagent bottles.</p> <p>So it's no surprise to learn that scientists are deserting the discipline in their droves. Around the country soil science departments have closed, and key research scientists have emigrated or retired. Postgraduate research has virtually dried up.</p> <p>There's probably no better illustration of society's metropolitan attitude to the countryside than the neglect of this vital discipline and the elevation of environmental studies to pole position. If we're not careful it will be our undoing. Those in touch with the real world know that our dependence on the soil remains total.</p> <p>Terrestrial life on this planet depends, as it always has, on the chemical and biological processes that take place in the top few centimetres of earth. If the soil breaks down we and most other life forms on the planet are in big trouble. That's why the cracks showing in the intensively-farmed hectares of eastern England should be a wake-up call for us all. If our prime agricultural land is rapidly becoming sub-prime we need to find out the reasons why, and fast.</p> <p>By way of consolation, the policy-makers might like to know there need be no real conflict between food production and environmental protection. In their RASE report, the soil scientists speak of encouraging <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/\">Defra</a> \"to move from its current largely environmental policy to one which embraces production within the environmental framework\".</p> <p>What I take this to mean is that if we ensure our soils are working well, we'll get plenty of food along with a diverse and healthy countryside. If that's what they do mean then I, for one, am right behind them.</p> <p><em>To read more, visit Graham Harvey's <a href=\"http://grahamsgrassroots.blogspot.com/\">blog</a> and check out his new book, <a href=\"http://grassrootsfood.co.uk/\">The Carbon Fields</a>.</em></p>",
  "<p>The Ugandan government warned this week that the country faces a drop in funding from overseas because of the global financial crisis.</p> <p>Finance minister Ezra Suruma told parliament that while Uganda was not \"directly exposed\" to risk, the <strong><a href=\"http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/news/Mutebile_Suruma_warn_on_economy_73615.shtml\">economic downturn</a></strong> could lead to a reduction of money coming into the country from outside investments, tourism, remittances from abroad and aid flows from donor countries, reported the Daily Monitor.</p> <p>His comments followed those of the governor of the Central Bank, Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile, who warned that the global crisis would slow Uganda's growth.</p> <p>\"We expect the recession in Europe and the US to reduce demand on our exports. This will lead to less earnings from exports, earnings from tourism are also going to be affected,\" Mutebile reportedly said. \"Tentatively, I can say that instead of the 8% growth rate, it will be in the range of 5% or 6%.\"</p> <p>While offering assurances that Uganda remained strong, both men were forced to comment after the Ugandan shilling fell against the US dollar this week.</p> <p>However, MPs said they wanted more assurances.</p> <p>Soroti MP Alice Alaso, said: \"Suruma is holding an economic bomb which is about to explode. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to be serious in offering solutions before it is too late. We need to prepare, the dollar crisis is just the beginning and we can't afford to sit back when the bomb is about to explode.\"</p> <h2>LRA ultimatum</h2> <p>The International Criminal Court this week ordered the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to arrest Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) leader Joseph Kony, who is believed to be hiding out in the country or neighbouring Central African Republic.</p> <p>The ICC warned the DRC that if it failed to outline the measures it had taken to execute the warrants against Kony and three other leaders, two of whom are believed to have died since they were issued, it would refer the matter to the UN general assembly.</p> <p>The Daily Monitor reported this week that the DRC and Sudan had been reluctant to follow up on the warrants because of on-going peace talks between the LRA and the Ugandan government. </p> <p>The ICC claims it has evidence that Kony has been carrying out attacks on civilians in the DRC since fleeing Uganda.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Ugandan MPs were told that around 30,000 children kidnapped by the LRA in northern Uganda had been <strong><a href=\"http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/news/Kony_sells_30_000_children_in_Darfur_73523.shtml\">sold in Darfur</a></strong> and were being used as child soldiers, porters or sex slaves by Sudanese.</p> <p>Kony has repeatedly refused to sign a peace deal that would end the 20-year insurgency, which has left hundreds dead and millions displaced, until the ICC warrants are withdrawn. Kony wants to be tried in Uganda and the president, Yoweri Museveni, has said he will set up a special court to do so. The ICC is refusing to withdraw the warrants.</p> <h2>Grant for scientist</h2> <p>A Ugandan scientist has won a grant from the <strong><a href=\"http://www.gcgh.org/Explorations/Pages/GrantsAwarded.aspx\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a></strong> to research work to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV in Uganda. </p> <p>Dr Anthony Mbonye, an assistant commissioner in charge of reproductive health at the Ministry of Health, was among the 104 scientists from 22 countries in five continents awarded grants this week to research new ways of preventing and curing infectious diseases, such as HIV/Aids and TB.</p> <p>The grants were selected from nearly 4,000 proposals.</p> <p>Mbonye will receive a grant of around $100,000.</p> <p>The aim of the Gates foundation is to help all people lead health, productive lives. In developing countries, it focuses on improving people's health and opportunities to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty.</p> <h2>Prize for Mogae</h2> <p>The former president of Botswana, Festus Gontebanye Mogae, was this week named the <strong><a href=\"http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/index-2008/mediacentre/20_10_2008.asp\">winner</a></strong> of the Ibrahim prize for excellence in African leadership.</p> <p>The former president, who retired from office in April after a decade in the post, was praised for ensuring \"continued stability and prosperity in the face of an HIV/Aids pandemic which threatened the future of his country and people\".</p> <p>Mogae, 69, has received international praise for tackling rising HIV/Aids rates in Botswana. The country has the second highest rates in the world behind Swaziland. He publicly took a HIV test, pushed for more antiretrovirals to be made available and campaigned to cut mother to baby transmissions.</p> <p>Kofi Annan, the chairman of the prize committee, praised Mogae's stewardship of the country's economy.</p> <p>\"Botswana demonstrates how a country with natural resources can promote sustainable development with good governance, in a continent where too often mineral wealth has become a curse.\"</p> <p>Oxford-education Mogae will receive $5m over 10 years and $200,000 annually for life thereafter. </p> <p>Last month he was appointed a UN special envoy on climate change.</p> <p>The Ibrahim prize, established by Sudanese-born billionaire Mo Ibrahim, was launched in October 2006 to support good African leadership. The prize committee assess the performance of democratically elected former heads of state or government from sub-Saharan African countries who have served their term in office within the limits set by their country's constitution, and have left office within the last three years. </p> <p>The announcement of this year's winner comes a fortnight after the publication of the Ibrahim index that ranks sub-Saharan African nations according to governance. Botswana ranked fourth out of 57 countries, one place above neighbouring South Africa.</p> <h2>Unharmonious cities</h2> <p>Cities in South Africa are the most unequal in the world, with the gulf between rich and poor getting wider, according to a UN-Habitat report published this week. </p> <p>The <strong><a href=\"http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=5964&amp;catid=7&amp;typeid=46&amp;subMenuId=0\">State of the World's Cities</a></strong> report, published every two years, found that the economic crisis will further widen the gap and push more people into poverty.</p> <p>The report warned that more people will be pushed into slum areas, which could trigger unrest if governments did not take the urban poverty crisis seriously.</p> <p>According to the <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/23/population-egalitarian-cities-urban-growth\">report</a></strong>, South Africa, \"stands out\" as a country that has yet to \"break out of an economic and political model that concentrates resources\", although it has made some progress in recent years. Namibian cities were also found to be among the most unequal.</p> <p>The report measured disparities of income on the \"Gini coefficient\", usually used to measure wealth of countries. The higher the Gini coefficient score, the more unequal the region.</p> <p>Rising economic growth rates in several African states had not reduced income or consumption disparities and in cities such as Maputo, in Mozambique and Nairobi in Kenya, inequalities remain high as wealth becomes more concentrated. Inequalities in African cities are higher than in rural areas. </p> <p>Surveys in 17 small cities and towns around Lake Victoria in the three east African countries of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda show that levels of inequality were almost the same as those of big cities, largely because of high urban growth rates that are not backed up by infrastructure and basic services, such as water and sanitation. The Gini coefficient for income in these towns did not vary much between countries (0.56 for the Kenyan towns, 0.57 for the Tanzanian towns and 0.55 for the Ugandan towns). </p> <p>Freetown, in Sierra Leone, Dire Dawa, in Ethiopia and Dar es Salaam, in Tanzania, were among the most equal cities in sub-Saharan Africa, the report found.</p> <p>The executive director of UN-Habitat, Anna Tibaijuka, said: \"This edition of the State of the World's Cities shows that spatial and social disparities within cities and between cities and regions within the same country are growing as some areas benefit more than others from public services, infrastructure and other investments. Evidence presented in this report also shows that when cities already have high levels of inequality, spatial and social disparities are likely to become more, and not less, pronounced with economic growth.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is a problem that has taxed the world's leading scientific minds and its greatest doctors; some of the richest people on the planet have pumped billions of pounds into finding a solution.</p> <p>But a new project aimed at curbing the spread of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/hiv\">HIV</a> in Africa has discovered that one of the most effective weapons is the humble text message.</p> <p>Faced with 1,000 HIV-related deaths in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica\">South Africa</a> every day, a global group of organisations has teamed up to create <a href=\"http://www.poptech.org/project_m/\">Project Masiluleke</a>, which aims to increase HIV awareness, testing and treatment across Africa using mobile phones.</p> <p>The first stage of the project \u2013 which has already shown remarkable results in early trials \u2013 involves sending out free text messages to millions of people every day urging them to call a confidential phone line if they have any concerns about HIV and Aids.</p> <p>Pilot projects have seen immediate results, with a four-fold increase in the number of calls to the country's National AIDS Helpline and a significant response from target groups. </p> <p>Future plans still under development include offering free home HIV testing kits, and using text messages to remind patients about their hospital appointments and keep them informed about their medical treatment.</p> <p>\"This is a critical effort,\" said Dr Krista Dong, an HIV and tuberculosis specialist and director of education group iTeach, which is one of Masiluleke's backers. </p> <p>Speaking at the launch of the project at the <a href=\"http://www.poptech.org/\">Pop!Tech</a> conference in Camden, Maine, Dong said that the need for innovative approaches to the crisis was urgent. </p> <p>\"With hundreds of thousands of people suffering and dying, it's no longer a question of 'should we do this?' or even 'how should we do this?'. It's 'how fast can we do this?'.\"</p> <p>Finding new ways to educate the public about HIV and Aids is an important issue for a country that has failed to stem the rapid growth of infection. </p> <p>South Africa has a huge problem, with infection rates averaging almost 11% across the country. In areas such as the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, where Project Masiluleke is based, the numbers are even more shocking: one in six people has HIV, and up to 40% of pregnant women carry the virus.</p> <p>Despite the high prevalence of Aids, only 5% of people in the country have ever been tested for the virus \u2013 mostly when they were already in the advanced stages and close to death. Men in particular are a problem group, because the powerful social stigma associated with being found HIV positive means they refuse to visit clinics.</p> <p>The organisations backing Project Masiluleke said text messaging was being used because mobile technology is so pervasive in South Africa and remains private. At least 90% of people carry a mobile there, and phone adoption is also growing rapidly across the rest of the continent, potentially allowing similar schemes to be rolled out easily in other Aids-affected countries.</p> <p>\"Because there's a phone in almost every family, we really have almost universal coverage, so it's an ideal opportunity for us to drive testing.\" said Gustav Praekelt, director of the Praekelt Foundation, a South African non-profit organisation involved in the scheme. </p> <p>\"The other important thing is because of the scarcity of other services in Africa and South Africa, it's become a central component for people to get access to information, entertainment, medical care and banking services.\"</p> <p>The scheme has support from a wide group of organisations, including the Pop!Tech conference organisers, American innovation group Frog Design and African phone network MTN. The scheme's backers hope that Masiluleke, which means \"lend a helping hand\" in Zulu, will eventually start to have a noticeable effect on infection rates because it offers a combination of intimacy and privacy.</p> <p>\"In a country where it is so obvious that we are challenged by HIV, you would think there would be enough knowledge to help people to either access care or change behaviour,\" said Zinny Thabete, an HIV campaigner with iTeach. </p> <p>\"But people do not want to go to their clinics to access care \u2026 People fear who's going to see them and what's going to be said about them.\"</p>",
  "<p>I don't know about you, but I'm done with economic meltdown. I'm finished listening to my boss do the doomy-gloomy speech every time anyone mentions next year's budget. And I've had enough of taking in my own lunch. Frankly, I need a lie-down, ideally somewhere the boss can't find me. </p> <p>Given the choice I wouldn't mind trying out the <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gQjY45Z2qzLCZvPDQz6H0UnZKPKQ\">World's Most Relaxing Room</a>, designed by Professor Richard Wiseman at the University of Hertfordshire. Thirty years of research has established that soft mats, green light, a blue screen, a whiff of lavender and a bit of classical music comprises the most relaxing environment possible. It's certainly a change of scene for banker Ken Dougall. \"Lying on the floor listening to music is very different to what I'm normally doing on a work day morning,\" he says. I bet it is, Ken. Though I wouldn't try it at home - as Professor Wiseman points out: \"Setting up the room has been enormously stressful\". </p> <p>Some rather odd news from BusinessWorld: apparently <a href=\"http://www.bworldonline.com/BW102408/content.php?id=083\">women office workers love their computers</a> more than their partners. On average, women spend 9.3 hours with their computers compared to just 3.6 hours with their partners. Is that not just women spending their working day in the office? But it gets weirder. According to the study women love their computers more than their partners \"even if it causes them pain\". What, like when the monitor tells you that it loves you, but it's not in love with you? Or like when the hard drive says it's having an affair with the printer from down the hall? It turns out it's something to do with carpal tunnel syndrome, but I think we all get the basic message. Women! Leave that computer alone and get back to the kitchen! </p> <p>On a brighter note, The Irish Herald reports that people who work hard and take pride in what they do are likely to <a href=\"http://www.herald.ie/world-news/work-hard-and-take-pride-youll-live-longer-1506568.html\">live longer</a>. Conscientious grafters are 50% less likely to die at any given age than those who are not. I always knew that wastrels like me were a lost cause, but an early death as well? And there I was hoping to be a burden on my family. </p> <p>For the slackest among us, planning for retirement may soon be unnecessary - the Office for National Statistics has announced that the average age at which men finish work continues to rise. It has now reached <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7685757.stm\">almost 65</a> - the highest since records began in 1984.

  "<p>The pound is falling at its fastest rate since the ERM debacle in 1992 after it was officially confirmed today that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/economicgrowth-recession\">the UK economy is shrinking faster than feared</a>.</p> <p>Sterling plunged by almost 10 cents against the dollar to a low of $1.5270, its lowest level since August 2002, after the Office for National Statistics reported that UK GDP fell by 0.5% in the third quarter of the year. It also dropped sharply against the euro, slipping to \u20ac1.22 from \u20ac1.256 overnight, and hit a 12-year low against a broad basket of other currencies.</p> <p>As recently as July the pound was trading above $2, but it has now shed more than 25% of its value against the dollar, as investors abandon the currency in anticipation that the UK will be a major casualty of the global downturn.</p> <p>Analysts said that the pound was falling at its fastest rate since 1992, when the UK toppled out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.</p> <p>\"Risk-averse investors are abandoning the lame-duck pound for the lower-risk US dollar, and in particular US Treasury Bonds. The implications of this for a country so heavily reliant on its imports as the UK may be severe,\" said Piers Cracknell, commercial director of Moneycorp.</p> <p>Cracknell said that the cost of importing goods from the US and the far east have rocketed this week. \"There is no doubt that these costs will be passed on into the high street, he warned.</p> <p>Today's decline came as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/marketturmoil-creditcrunch1\">stockmarkets worldwide fell sharply</a>, driven down by growing fears of a world recession. In London the FTSE 100 fell by 9% after the GDP numbers were released. This followed turmoil in Asia where markets tumbled by over 10% overnight, as gloomy forecasts from Sony and Samsung sent their shares plunging by as much as 14%.</p> <p>Amid the wild swings on the currency markets this morning the yen hit a 13-year high against the US dollar and gained 4% against the euro, bringing new pain to Japanese exporters.</p> <p>The fall in sterling should give a boost to Britain's struggling exporters, as it makes their goods cheaper abroad. But it pushes up the cost of imports at a time when retailers are already suffering as consumers cut back, and also makes a foreign holiday more expensive.</p> <p>Sterling had already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/22/pound-recession-interest-rates\">shed 7 cents on Wednesday</a> after Mervyn King admitted for the first time that the UK is probably entering recession. The shock fall in GDP compounded fears that the slowdown could be deeper and longer than analysts thought.</p> <p><strong>Greenspan: I was wrong</strong></p> <p>The inquest into the global economic crisis has already begun. Yesterday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/economics-creditcrunch-federal-reserve-greenspan\">Alan Greenspan</a> admitted that mistakes were made in deregulating the financial markets.</p> <p>The former Federal Reserve chairman admitted to a congressional committee that he had been \"partially wrong\" in his hands-off approach towards the banking industry and that the credit crunch had left him in a state of shocked disbelief. </p> <p>\"I have found a flaw,\" said Greenspan, referring to his economic philosophy. \"I don't know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact.\"</p>",
  "<p>A curious photograph, taken at the Italian grand prix, surfaced last week. <a href=\"http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/71638\">It featured 16 men, mostly suited, posing on the patio of a grand house</a>. At first glance it might be a reunion, 40 years since graduation, of a prep school class, although some of the faces are too perma-tanned to have hailed from an English backwater. One of the figures, arms crossed and shades on, is grinning broadly ... it's Flavio Briatore. And there's Ross Brawn and Mario Thiessen and Frank Williams and Nick Fry and so on. Yes, it's the new covenant within the paddock club, within the exclusive travelling circus that is grand prix racing: Fota (Formula One Teams Association). And last month they all looked rather pleased with themselves, having laid down their daggers, and shared a Campari and soda.</p> <p>Now comes the news, following a post-Chinese grand prix meeting in Geneva, that they've brought about an unusual development: an alliance has been formed between the rival teams and the governing body. Alright, so this was hardly the Yalta conference (but I'll give you the pleasure of picking out who'd be your Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill), but formula one is not a sport often caught casting a self-appraising glance in the mirror. Yet in the era of the global economic tsunami recession hell \u2014 that's the official term, isn't it? \u2014 the sport's feet have thudded on to the asphalt and they've agreed a raft of measures, starting in 2009, that could include standard engines (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2008/oct/21/formulaone-motorsports\">although some think this is a step too far</a>).</p> <p>The details are hazy and there is more discussion to come after the Brazilian grand prix, but the lack of politicking and mind games, coupled with the impetus to save some money beginning <em>next season</em>, is unheard of. The words landmark and historic have been bandied about. And, although we might be tempted to change our minds once the finer details are aired, we should for now hail the fact that the sport has come together. It's a bit like F1 in Need, minus Pudsey Bear (although Brawn does look slightly cuddly).</p> <p>What a difference a year makes. Several of the sport's facets have been inverted, and it's easy to forget it's only 12 months since the great dramas of 2007. Gone is the bitch-fight between Ferrari and McLaren; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/oct/20/mclaren-ferrari-hamilton-massa \">Ferrari team director Stefano Domenicali even complimented Lewis Hamilton's crushing Shanghai win</a>. The row over customer cars has softened into an apparent extension of the deal for manufacturers to supply several teams with engines. Kimi Raikkonen has somehow lost the ability to successfully pilot a car that won him the title last year. And Hamilton, who fluffed what should have been a title-winning season in 2007, has kept his charge on course this time around, albeit having shed his golden-boy image.</p> <p>So, all change then. The only constant factor is that Fernando Alonso is still capable of the achingly adept drives that convince you he is the best racer on the grid, meanwhile appearing to possess the most unlikeable personality. After all those monotonous years of the late 1990s and early 2000s, formula one has found some impetus to adapt, the 2008 season revealing a new topography. It's just baffling that this has been accompanied by a softening of relations, a meeting of boffin-like minds. How long until normal service is resumed?</p> <h2>Last weekend's action</h2> <p>Only one man has won three <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/nascar\">Nascar</a> titles in a row, but this year Jimmie Johnson looks destined to match Cale Yarborough's record. <a href=\"http://guardian.autosport.com/gp.php?l=0&amp;d=710&amp;r=20087132&amp;c=0\">Victory at Martinsville last weekend</a> \u2014 marking the Californian's 39th visit to the winner's circle \u2014 has put him <a href=\"http://guardian.autosport.com/cp.php?l=0&amp;d=710&amp;r=7102008&amp;c=30\">149 points clear of Greg Biffle with four Sprint Cup races left</a>. Most telling was the manner in which he did it, with second place Dale Earnhardt Jr conceding he couldn't get close enough for a pass. If Johnson keeps his form up the crown is his, but were Biffle to finish 39 positions higher \u2014 in other words, if Johnson stuffs it and Biffle finishes at the front \u2014 then he'll catch him in one fell swoop.</p> <h2>This weekend's action</h2> <p>I've already mentioned Scottish driver Paul di Resta's emergence as a contender for this year's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/touringcars\">DTM</a> title, although I hadn't got round to bringing up the matter of his tests in the McLaren formula one car. As a Mercedes driver, it wasn't a huge surprise. Rumour has it that some of the German bigwigs had spotted Sebastian Vettel's success and asked why the man who beat him to the 2006 F3 Euro Series crown, di Resta, hadn't been given a chance. And now he has, of sorts. Let's just hope that this week's testing days don't disrupt his feel for the Merc C-Classe. He needs to score three more points than Audi rival Timo Scheider at the N\u00fcrburgring this weekend to become DTM champion. Then he can ponder whether (despite the apparent re-signing of Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella) he'll be driving a Mercedes-engined Force India next season.</p>",

  "<p><strong>23.30 BST:</strong> So there it is, the first Ladies' Day at the Breeders' Cup and some memorable performances scattered all the way through the card.

What a day in store. </p> <p>This is Greg Wood signing off from Santa Anita. </p> <p><strong>23.24 BST:</strong> Zenyatta gets a standing ovation as she comes back past the stands. A shame that she'll never run up against Europe's best filly this season, Zarkava. It will now be up to the International Handicappers to determine which of these two outstanding animals is the best filly on the planet. </p> <p><strong>23.23 BST:</strong> The commentator acclaims \"a living legend\" as Zenyatta takes her career record to a perfect nine from nine. Last into the first turn as Bear Now set a steady pace, she was the third winner of the night to make a big move on the final turn. Mike Smith was forced to come five wide into the straight, but it made no difference as she closed down the leader and quickly went clear. </p> <p>Result: 1. Zenyatta, 2. Cocoa Beach, 3. Music Note. </p> <p><strong>23.10 BST:</strong> Zenyatta is drifting a little, to 1-2. She looks pretty composed, though, and it looks as if things are just easing up a little in the market as the punters baulk at her short price. </p> <p><strong>23.03 BST:</strong> Zenyatta is hovering at around 1.53 \u2013 roughly 8-15 \u2013 on Betfair, which just goes to show the sort of value you can get when The Man isn't taking a big chunk out of the betting pool. Here in PMU Monopoly Land, it's still 1-5 Zenyatta, and 8-1 bar. </p> <p><strong>22.59 BST:</strong> One of the visiting British journalists is debating whether to put his wife on Ebay and then stick all the proceeds on Zenyatta in the hope of buying her back with something to spare when the \"good thing\" obliges. On balance, he decides to err on the side of caution. How romantic. </p> <p><strong>22.51 BST:</strong> Looking at the Filly &amp; Mare Turf again, Halfway To Heaven stayed on up the straight, but just at the one pace. She has winning form over 10 furlongs in the Nassau Stakes, but that was a messy race on a sharp track. It looks like she just couldn't quite get home here. </p> <p><strong>22.47 BST:</strong> If you are chasing losses after the first four Breeders' Cup races, you will need to find a shock winner to stand any chance in the last. Zenyatta, reckoned a \"lock\" by the locals, is currently trading at 1-5 on the PMU. </p> <p><strong>22.39 BST:</strong> Result: 1. Forever Together, 2. Sealy Hill, 3. Wait A While, 4. Visit. </p> <p>Frankie Dettori showed great skill to get to the front on Folk Opera from stall nine, and then slowed things down coming down the straight for the first time, with Halfway To Heaven just behind and Wait A While close up in third. Visit was settled in eighth by Ryan Moore, but then got a dream run up the rail turning for home and led going into the final furlong as both Folk Opera and Halfway To Heaven dropped away. He couldn't hang on, though, and was swamped 100 yards from the line as Forever Together charged home ahead of the outsider Sealy Hill. </p> <p><strong>22.27 BST:</strong> Having risked sunstroke and heat exhaustion with a mad dash to the paddock, I can report the following: pretty much every horse ever foaled will look good with 100 degrees of Californian sunshine bouncing off its coat. Halfway To Heaven's coat shows hints of turning, but overall she looks to be thriving in the climate. Visit's coat is also starting to go, but overall this is a very impressive-looking field. Eight minutes to post. </p> <p><strong>22.14 BST:</strong> Visit is the first British-trained runner on the card, representing Sir Michael Stoute and Ryan Moore. Stoute's name does not seem to resonate quite like O'Brien's though, and she is showing at 16-1. </p> <p>Halfway To Heaven is still rock-solid at 2-1. The crowd must have heard his comments after Heart Shaped's race earlier on. </p> <p><strong>22.09 BST:</strong> The days when European horses were always longer on the local PMU than back at home seem to be over. Halfway To Heaven is currently trading at 7-2 on Betfair for the next race, the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, but is a 2-1 chance here in the States. Wait A While is 4-1 along with Vacare, while Godolphin's Folk Opera, who took the EP Taylor at Woodbine last time out, is 10-1. </p> <p>Stardom Bound paid $5.20 for a $2 stake, by the way. </p> <p><strong>22.00 BST:</strong> Just like Ventura in the first, Stardom Bound made a huge move from well off the pace, charged past the field turning in and had the race put to bed a long way from home. Star Diva was third in the photo, just edging out Dave's Revenge. Pursuit Of Glory was never in the hunt, starting slowly and then being buried in the pack by Johnny Murtagh before dropping away in the stretch. </p> <p><strong>21.53 BST:</strong> Pursuit Of Glory is into 9-1 from 14-1 - her Newmarket form in the Cheveley Park looks a lot better after Heart Shaped's run in the last.</p> <p>1. Stardom Bound, 2. Dream Empress, 3. photo. </p> <p><strong>21.44 BST:</strong> Apologies for the time-lag on posts so far. Guardian technology seems to have taken a (temporary) backward step since last year when I was able to file and store entries myself. This year they are going via head office on email, and the good people on the desk are snowed under as it is. </p> <p>Worth noting here that the field for the Juvenile Fillies includes Doremifasollatido. If you haven't heard any of Tom Durkin's commentaries on this horse's victories, do yourself a favour and look one up on YouTube. The man's a genius. </p> <p>Sky Diva has broken the parade here and is getting a little worked up. </p> <p><strong>21.32 BST:</strong> Next up is the Juvenile Fillies' on the Pro-Ride, and the first chance for a European on the new synthetic track. Pursuit Of Glory, trained by David Wachman, will carry the same orange and blue silks that went so close on Heart Shaped. </p> <p>Stardom Bound, with Mike Smith in the saddle, is the 6-5 favourite at the track, with CS Silk (Robby Alborado), a 15-1 chance on the morning line, next in at 5-1 along with Sky Diva (Ramon Dominguez).</p> <p><strong>21.26 BST:</strong> The photo-finish print has just gone up on the CCTV. It was even closer than it looked. </p> <p>Beyond Our Reach and Frankie Dettori were last going into the Clubhouse turn and never threatened to get involved. Murtagh was also a long way back early, but is taking a positive view. The track TV has quoted him as saying that the way the course is riding will be perfect for Halfway To Heaven in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf. </p> <p><strong>21.22 BST:</strong> So close for O'Brien and Johny Murtagh as Heart Shaped finishes best of all but can't quite get to Maram. One more stride would have done it. Laragh had led from the start until well down the stretch, but started to wander a furlong out and faded into third. </p> <p>Frustrating for Ballydoyle, but at least it shows that their string is in form - indeed, when O'Brien discussed his team here on Thursday, Heart Shaped was perhaps the one about which he enthused the least. And it is not a Grade One event yet, so would not have counted towards their assault on Bobby Frankel's record of 25 in a season. </p> <p>Result:</p> <p>1. Maram (ridden Jose Lezcano) 11-1, 2. Heart Shaped 10-1, 3. Laragh 5-2. </p> <p><strong>21.05 BST:</strong> Ten minutes to post for the Juvenile Fillies' Turf. Consequence, the mount of John Velasquez, was 8-1 on the morning line, but is popular with the early punters and is a 5-2 chance now, just ahead of Laragh (Edgar Prado) on 3-1. There is European interest here, with Beyond Our Reach representing Tommy Stack and Heart Shaped running for Aidan O'Brien. </p> <p><strong>20.51 BST:</strong> Ventura's performance just gets more extraordinary the more you look at it. On dirt, it is held to be suicide to make a move like that on the turn, but on Pro-Ride it seems to be possible. Her time was just 1/100th of a second outside Indian Blessing's track record, and Gomez had the race won a furlong out. And all this from a filly who was running around Newbury in soft-ground handicaps for Amanda Perrett this time last year. </p> <p><strong>20.45 BST:</strong> What a performance to start the meeting. Ventura was a little awkward getting away from the stalls and settled well off the pace by Garrett Gomez, but three furlongs from home she tore through the field and then swept past Indian Blessing at the top of the straight. Bobby Frankel seemed very confident about her chance earlier in the week, and she has justified every ounce of it. </p> <p>Result: 1. Ventura $7.60 (for a $2 stake), 2. Indian Blessing 9-5, 3. Zaftig. </p> <p><strong>20.29 BST:</strong> Here come the runners. Indian Blessing's silks have the words \"NO BULL\" on the back in very large letters \u2013 it's the slogan of Hal Earnhardt, the car dealer who owns her. Lady Sprinter is on her toes and looks ready to explode, which is a worry over today's seven-furlong trip as her best form is at shorter. </p> <p><strong>20.19 BST:</strong> Arnold Schwarzenegger has just been on the closed-circuit TV, welcoming everyone to California and pointing out, somewhat bizarrely, that the $25m available in prize money over the next two days is \"even more than the budget for Hercules in New York\" \u2013 which was his first film. Thanks, Wikipedia. </p> <p>He also wants everyone to \"stay as long as you can, because we need your cash, if you know what I mean.\" If only British politicians could be so direct. </p> <p>Anyway, back to business. Fifteen minutes to post for the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint, and Indian Blessing (2-1) is just holding onto favouritism from Ventura (5-2), with Zaftig third in on 9-2. </p> <p><strong>18.43 BST:</strong> Good morning from Santa Anita racecourse in California, where the temperature is heading for 100 degrees, the horses are fit and ready, and the shutters are going up on the betting windows ahead of Breeders' Cup XXV. It is, according to your point of view, racing's Superbowl, its Ryder Cup or \u2014 bearing in mind its \"medication\" issues \u2014 its Olympics. And there are still some diehards in Britain and Ireland who would rather be getting rain-lashed at Cartmel.</p> <p>But this is as close to a global championship meeting as Flat racing ever gets, and the overseas representation in the 14 races over the next two days is larger than ever. How many will return victorious? And will the new Pro-Ride surface, replacing the traditional dirt for the first time at a Breeders' Cup, really level the playing field?</p> <p>From my seat about five yards from the track, I can report that the San Gabriel mountains look magnificent, the turf course looks a little greener than it did earlier in the week but will still be lightning fast, and the Pro-Ride looks \u2026 well \u2026 brown. It's an interesting substance, soft and spongey and noticeably different to the Polytrack that is now familiar to British punters, but similar in practice in that there is no kickback and it is much kinder to the horses. An entire field can gallop past at full speed and you will barely hear a sound.</p> <p>Today's card is restricted to fillies, which is, according to the organisers, a bold move to create a Ladies' Day at the meeting. Many stateside fans, though, seem to see it as an unnecessary attempt to sideline 50% of the equine species on to a day when many fans are at work an unable to watch.</p> <p>The decision to rename the Distaff as the Ladies' Classic has attracted much derision, and Zenyatta, sure to start favourite for the race, comes close to Curlin in terms of the glamour-factor over here and would surely deserve a place on Saturday's \"main\" card.</p> <p>None the less, the \"handicappers\" are starting to fill the huge main stand here, and the action will begin with the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint at 8.35pm BST. Indian Blessing, who holds the track record for seven furlongs, is an uneasy favourite for this race this morning, as money comes for Bobby Frankel's Ventura, who has been a springer in the market all week.</p> <p>The main European challenger later is Aidan O'Brien's Halfway To Heaven in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, though the reason why Johnny Murtagh has been jogging around the Pro-Ride in a sweatsuit every morning has recently become apparent with the announcement that he will put up 2lb overweight on the triple Group One winner. In a tight race, that could prove very significant.</p>",
  "<p>Sallying forth in one of his verbal excursions in Seattle on Sunday, Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden told a roomful of supporters that \"the world is looking\" as the United States was \"about to elect a brilliant 47-year-old senator president\". Biden then told the room to \"<a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/20/biden-predicts-early-crisis-will-test-obama/\">watch, we're going to have an international crisis</a>, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy\".</p> <p>While the meaning of Biden's remarks was clear \u2013 he is quite confident that a President Obama will pass any such test \u2013 this was another unfortunate example of the voluble senator from Delaware tripping over his own tongue, going for baroque when plain speaking was called for.</p> <p>Jumping at the opportunity to pull the debate back to national security \u2013 an issue John McCain actually feels comfortable talking about \u2013 the McCain campaign blasted out a mass email that transparently misrepresented Biden as claiming \"Barack Obama's election guarantees an international crisis\". That is, they had Biden say what McCain has been trying to strongly imply for the last 10 months.</p> <p>Former New York mayor and McCain supporter Rudy Giuliani also piled on the criticism, calling Biden's statement \"extraordinary\" and asserting that \"it is not uniformly the case that the mettle of American presidents is tested\". Giuliani insisted that \"Senator McCain would not present that same risk that Joe Biden seems to be worried about\".</p> <p>Senator Joe Lieberman, one of John McCain's closest allies and confidantes, apparently disagrees. Appearing on Face the Nation back in June, Lieberman predicted, just as Biden did on Sunday, that \"<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/29/ftn/main4217516.shtml\">our enemies will test the new president early</a>\". The following day, the White House confirmed Lieberman's comments. \"<a href=\"http://www.democracyarsenal.org/2008/10/white-house-agr.html\">I think senator Lieberman, unfortunately, could be right</a>,\" said press secretary Dana Perino. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, <a href=\"http://www.democracyarsenal.org/2008/10/chertoff-agrees.html\">also seemed to agree with Biden</a>, saying: \"<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&amp;sid=a7MuiagBPMz4\">terrorists may see the change</a> to a new US president over the next six months as a prime chance to attack, no matter who wins the White House.\"</p> <p>But the message coming from the McCain camp is clear: A President Obama would invite \"testing\" in a way that a President McCain would not. McCain's top foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann stated in a press call that \"in foreign policy, it is weakness that is provocative\". These sorts of arguments about credibility and reputation are inherently subjective. Yes, weakness can be provocative. But strength can also be provocative, especially when exercised without good judgment. </p> <p>After 9/11, McCain was one of the <a href=\"http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/06/06/mccain-the-war-salesman/\">foremost advocates of the invasion of Iraq</a>, justified partly on the basis that such an invasion would be a way of \"showing strength\" in response to the attack on our homeland. It turned out that showing strength by invading and occupying Iraq turned out to be both incredibly provocative and disastrous for America's security. The war attracted thousands of militants to Iraq, fueled unprecedented levels of anti-Americanism around the world and continues to bleed the US of lives and resources.</p> <p>The correct question is not whether a president is \"strong\" or \"weak,\" but whether his policies are effective. There is a general consensus among analysts that al-Qaida will, at some point, attempt another attack here in the US, and that attack will likely be generated from al-Qaida's base on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area, where they were allowed to regroup when the Bush administration turned its attention to Iraq. Al-Qaida clearly recognises that they have benefited from Bush's approach, which posits a war of civilisations between Islam and the west. The Washington Post reported today that a prominent al-Qaida website has declared its support for McCain, who they believe will faithfully continue the \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/21/AR2008102102477.html\">failing march of his predecessor</a>\". </p> <p>Given the era of global transformation and uncertainty in which we live, there's no doubt that the next president will be tested in a number of ways. Dealing effectively with tomorrow's crises will require the new administration to use the full range of US power - diplomatic, economic and military - and eschew the focus on military solutions that has resulted in an intact and active al-Qaida, an empowered Iran, a more destabilised Middle East and a less secure America seven years after 9/11. </p> <p>It's true that John McCain has been tested in the past, as his supporters claim. But his unstinting support for the ruinous policies of George Bush - and his promise that, if elected, he would continue those policies - has earned him a failing grade.</p>",
  "<p>The retailer regarded as a barometer for the state of the high street unveiled new sales figures today which point to another alarming slump in consumer confidence. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis\">John Lewis</a> department store chain said trade was down a disturbing 7.6% in the seven days to October 18 - the week when the government was forced into an emergency bail-out of three of the UK's biggest banks. </p> <p>It is the fifth consecutive week of sales declines for the department store. </p> <p>The retailer said sales were hit by the different timing of school half term breaks in different parts of the country, but there was also a dip on the Saturday compared with the same Saturday last year when England played South Africa in the rugby world cup final in Paris and high streets were quiet. </p> <p>Only one store, in Aberdeen, recorded sales higher than last year and 17 were down by more than 10%. The worst performing outlet was Peterborough, down 25% on a year ago. </p> <p>Growth has also slowed rapidly at the department store's online business. JohnLewis.com was recording annual gains of more than 20% until recently, but is now up just 5.7% on last year. </p> <p>Earlier this week, a survey showed that internet spending in September was up 15%, compared with the 73% growth recorded 12 months earlier. </p> <p>The worst performing John Lewis departments were those selling homewares, which were down 13.5% on a year ago. Electricals and home technology were down nearly 10%, although fashion sales were ahead 0.9%. </p> <p>The company said it believed other retailers were performing even worse. \"We know that if it's tough for John Lewis, the chances are it's even tougher for everyone else. Our task remains to outperform the wider market and all indications are that we continue to do so,\" the store said. </p> <p>Earlier this week, Home Retail Group said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/23/argos-homebase-home-retail-group\">recent sales at its Argos offshoot were down about 9%</a> - the worst decline in the chain's 35-year history. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/22/debenhams-retail\">Debenhams</a> said sales had fallen 4% in recent weeks while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/23/dsginternational-retail\">PC World is down 11% in the past six months and Currys is down 7%</a>. </p> <p>A raft of retailers have announced cuts in investment spending to conserve cash. </p> <p>House of Fraser and Debenhams have been cutting prices to pull in shoppers, which is bound to hit profit margins. Over the past two weeks, HoF has been running a mid-season sale, while Debenhams has just had another day of \"blue cross\" discounts. </p> <p>John Lewis's Waitrose supermarkets are also under pressure as shoppers trade down to cheaper grocers and brands. Sales at the upmarket chain last week were ahead just 0.5% on last year's levels - including the impact of inflation. </p> <p>Economist Howard Archer of Global Insight said the financial crisis and fears about the economy had given already-nervous consumers another jolt: \"Given that John Lewis' department store sales are seen as a good bellwether for the health of consumer spending, the 7.6% year-on-year plunge in sales intensifies fears that retailers are in for an extremely difficult Christmas and beyond. </p> <p>\"There is no getting away from the fact that this is a very disappointing and worrying performance that bodes ill for the retail sector in general.\" </p> <p>Freddie George, retail analyst at Seymour Pierce, said: \"Our major concern is that retailers, particularly the apparel retailers, are facing both weak sales in the lead up to Christmas and greater promotional activity, which will impact margins.\"</p>",
  "<p>You have to hand it to the women at Code Pink, the all-purpose protest group originally formed to oppose the Iraq war. They know how to liven up a boring banking conference.</p> <p>Barely had Karl Rove arrived on stage at the Mortgage Bankers Association's convention in San Francisco this week when he was set upon by a Code Pink campaigner wielding handcuffs.</p> <p>\"Karl Rove is not fit to address you,\" she yelled, declaring that she was executing a citizen's arrest for treason.</p> <p>The former White House aide, who is presumably used to such attention, sat strangely still as his assailant approached. A security guard intercepted the meeting of minds at the very last moment (you can watch it <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Ili0jgn_JD4\">here</a>).</p> <p>If America's mortgage bankers were looking for quality time to digest the year's disastrous happenings, they were disappointed. America's most liberal city was not going to let them slip quietly in and out.</p> <p>To many people, the homeloans industry bears a large slice of blame for the financial crisis gripping the global economy. Irresponsible sub-prime mortgages in America triggered a chain of events which led to Bear Stearns' collapse, to Iceland's national demise, to queues outside branches of Northern Rock in Britain and to this month's slow-motion stockmarket crash.</p> <p>Many of the attendees I spoke to here in San Francisco were philosophical, at least willing to admit to a smidgen of wrongdoing by their peers.</p> <p>\"A lot of folks are embarrassed to be part of this industry,\" one mortgage lawyer, Ted Eric May, told me sadly. \"But there are a lot of very good, very smart people here. A few bad apples took advantage in every possible way they could have done.\"</p> <p>William Quick, a mortgage lender from Washington state, agreed but insisted that shoddy behaviour was all in the past: \"There's been a purge - a lot of the bad actors have gone into other industries.\"</p> <p>As the mortgage industry's lobbying group, the MBA wasn't too keen to dwell on its role in an international economic scandal - though the association's new chairman, David Kittle, did come out with a few revealing utterances.</p> <p>\"Everybody needs a roof over their head - but not everybody needs to be a homeowner,\" said Kittle, in a moment of apparent revelation which sounded more like common sense. \"As we move beyond crisis mode, we will learn from our mistakes.\"</p> <p>He went on to quote a verse from the book of Proverbs: \"He who seeks to increase his wealth by charging excess interest rates amasses his wealth for one who has pity on the poor.\"</p> <p>All decent stuff. But it was only when Rove turned up to speak that the mortgage bankers showed their true colours. </p> <p>President Bush's one-time right-hand man trumpeted the Republicans' standard attack line by blaming the crisis on Democrats in Congress for failing to introduce tougher regulation of America's two government-sponsored mortgage aggregators - Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.</p> <p>This claim, which has been repeated ad nauseum on the campaign trail by John McCain and Sarah Palin, refers to efforts by the Democrats to widen home ownership by getting Fannie and Freddie to buy up a broader spectrum of homeloans in the financial market.</p> <p>\"These were relentless political organisations masquerading as government enterprises,\" said Rove. \"There's always going to be an imprudent borrower and there's always going to be an imprudent lender. To have someone who's going to facilitate that is extremely dangerous.\"</p> <p>Getting a resounding cheer, Rove named two leading Democrats - Christopher Dodd and Barney Frank - as \"persistent and unnecessary\" defenders of \"egregious practices\". The mortgage bankers in the hall lapped it up. It seemed that it wasn't their industry's fault after all - it was the Democrats to blame.</p> <p>One banker even felt moved to shout: \"We love you Karl, you're great.\"</p> <p>It was down to George Mitchell, the retired Democratic senator and peace negotiator, to remonstrate: \"The implication that two Democrats on Capitol Hill are responsible for all the problems we have is completely untrue and so far fetched as to be unbelievable.\"</p> <p>It doesn't really wash for mortgage bankers to pass the buck. Fannie and Freddie may have been excessively willing to buy dodgy loans on the secondary market - but that doesn't excuse those who wrote the absurd homeloans in the first place. </p> <p>Last year, the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119690485447515265.html\">found a Brazilian babysitter in California</a> who was approved for a $495,000 mortgage. A housekeeper, married to a taxi-driver, got a $713,000 loan. </p> <p>The biggest homeloans company in America, Countrywide Financial, had to be rescued from the brink of bankruptcy by Bank of America. This month, it agreed to amend 400,000 mortgages by as much as $8.7bn to settle investigations by prosecutors in 11 states.</p> <p>Picketers outside the convention wielded placards reading: \"Jail bankers! Let them rot!\"</p> <p>The MBA's chief operating officer, John Courson, was unmoved by such protests \u2013 he told me: \"This is America. They're free to say whatever they will to whoever they want to say it.\"</p> <p>Courson was keener to talk about initiatives such as Hope Now, which have helped avert a further 2.3m foreclosures. But he still seems to be in denial, insisting: \"I don't think the American public is upset with the mortgage banking industry.\"<br>Surely he can't be serious.</p>",
  "<p><strong>October 23 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Bank bail-out</strong></p> <p>Tim Burr, the comptroller and auditor general, is to examine the \u00a337bn bank bail-out, Edward Leigh (Con, Gainsborough), the chairman of the public accounts committee, said. Burr will look into whether the Treasury had secured compliance from the banks over maintaining lending to homeowners and small businesses. </p> <p><strong>Yacht controversy</strong></p> <p>David Winnick (Lab, Walsall North) was blocked by the Speaker, Michael Martin, from raising allegations that George Osborne sought a donation for the Tories from Oleg Deripaska, the Russian billionaire. </p> <p>Martin demanded: \"The shadow chancellor isn't in the chamber. Did you approach him to say you were going to make this statement or ask this question?\" </p> <p>Winnick replied: \"No, of course not.\" </p> <p>Martin said: \"Well, you should. You've been here long enough to know the courtesies of the house.\" </p> <p><strong>Afghanistan</strong></p> <p>Gordon Brown was labelled \"negligent\" and accused of failing to keep MPs updated on Britain's involvement in Afghanistan by Tory former defence minister Nicholas Soames. </p> <p>Soames said the prime minister's predecessors had regularly kept the Commons informed when the country had been at war. </p> <p>Troops were facing \"great danger\" on a daily basis and the conflict was \"constantly shifting\" strategically, he added. </p> <p>Chris Bryant, the deputy leader of the Commons, backed the importance of MPs receiving regular updates, adding that Brown took his responsibilities \"very seriously\". </p> <p><strong>Pirates</strong></p> <p>The Royal Navy has been given a new role to actively hunt pirate vessels, Bob Ainsworth, the armed forces minister, disclosed. </p> <p>Ainsworth said the navy had moved to a more \"proactive posture\" in tackling the threat. Royal Navy sources said commanding officers had been given the power to destroy equipment used by pirates - including sinking their vessels. </p> <p><strong>Violent crime</strong></p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, was asked by the shadow leader of the Commons, Theresa May, to make an \"urgent statement\" after revelations about the under-reporting of serious violent crime. </p> <p>Smith had conceded that 13 police forces had failed to properly record serious violent crime but said this should not dent public confidence in crime figures. </p> <p>May said: \"The home secretary has been touring the TV studios to justify this - but can we have an urgent statement ... in this house on this serious matter.\" </p> <p>Bryant said that in some police authorities they had chosen \u2013 \"following advice\" - to report some violent crimes in a \"slightly different way\". </p> <p><strong>Identity fraud</strong></p> <p>Fraudsters are able to steal people's identities by delaying their post at a post office depot, Labour former minister Gisela Stuart (Birmingham Edgbaston) warned. </p> <p>Stuart urged the government to ensure all agencies implemented safeguards against identity fraud. </p> <p>Bryant said the issue was \"significant\" and promised to raise it with the Department for Work and Pensions. </p> <p><strong>Unemployment</strong></p> <p>Jobcentres are braced to deal with an influx of unemployed bankers as a result of the collapse in the financial sector, the employment minister, Tony McNulty, said. </p> <p>Staff will have to deal with jobseekers from \"different sectors\" and \"different geographical areas\" as a result of the turmoil in the global markets. </p> <p><strong>Embryo bill</strong></p> <p>May accused the government of \"deliberately restricting\" the time available to debate the human fertilisation and embryology bill.</p> <p>Bryant said: \"The government is glad that the bill went through yesterday at third reading, with a very significant majority. There were a large number of free votes yesterday and I think the house came to its settled mind on this precise bill.\" </p> <p><strong>Spin</strong></p> <p>The government was accused by May of giving people \"false promises\" at a time of looming economic recession. </p> <p>By continually making \"reannouncements\" on policies but giving the impression they were new initiatives, ministers were \"more interested in spin than effective action\". </p> <p>But Bryant dismissed the claims and said he made no apologies for the government's communications. </p> <p><strong>Post offices</strong></p> <p>The delay in making a decision on whether the Post Office card account contract will be renewed is causing major uncertainty to sub-postmasters and customers, Jonathan Djanogly, the shadow business minister, warned. </p> <p>Pat McFadden, the business minister, told MPs: \"When we have made a decision on this I assure you it will be announced in the normal and proper way.\" </p> <p><strong>Tax</strong></p> <p>Lord Tebbit said it was a \"scandal\" that in effect the tax rate on the low paid was higher than on better off people. </p> <p>The Tory former cabinet minister said it was \"bad enough\" that most peers paid a marginal rate of 40% but added: \"What is far worse is that at the bottom of the stack people are paying rates of over 80% when you take into account both tax and loss of benefits.\" </p> <p>Lord Davies of Oldham, for the government, said that Lord Tebbit highlighted an \"important point\" but he was not sure it was addressed when the Tories were in office. </p> <p><strong>Pensions</strong></p> <p>Ministers backed down on plans to scrap armed forces pensions appeal tribunals. </p> <p>They had proposed to merge the body with other tribunals but the scheme was widely criticised by service charities. </p> <p>Lord Bach, the junior justice minister, said that following further consultation a dedicated armed forces tribunal would be preserved and the role of service members on panels would be \"maintained without diminution or alteration\". </p> <p><strong>Business rates</strong></p> <p>Albert Owen (Lab, Ynys Mon) urged ministers to reconsider changes to the way business rates are collected in ports. </p> <p>He said the Valuation Agency's re-rating of ports would be backdated to 2005 \"which will actually double the rates in many cases\". </p> <p>Bryant told him: \"I will raise these issues with the Treasury on your behalf.\" </p> <p><strong>Protesters</strong></p> <p>The Speaker is to investigate complaints that anti-war protesters in Parliament Square are using loud hailers \"persistently, incessantly and at unreasonable volume\". </p> <p>Martin said he would look into claims by Julian Lewis (Con, New Forest East) that a licence to use the equipment had expired. </p> <p><strong>Church</strong></p> <p>While the severity of the credit crunch caught City whizz-kids by surprise, Church of England commissioners \"sensed\" change was coming and acted to shore up investments, Sir Stuart Bell, who answers on behalf of the commissioners, told the Commons. </p> <p>He said they managed their investments \"proactively\" and were able to \"move swiftly when economic circumstances change\".</p>",
  "<h2>Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics</h2> <p>\"Not only do Q3's GDP figures confirm that the UK has entered a recession, but the 0.5% drop (consensus 0.2%) is truly shocking. The 1% drop in industrial production was actually a bit milder than we expected, so the big surprise was the 0.4% slump in services output. That, in turn, was driven by a whopping 1.7% drop in consumer-related services \u2013 further evidence that the resilient retail sales figures aren't to be believed. </p> <p>\"Of course, the fact that a recession is already underway (the CIPS/Markit surveys are consistent with a further drop in output in Q4) isn't a surprise \u2013 even Mervyn King and Gordon Brown referred to it earlier this week. But the fact that output has shrunk so much so early on in the downturn is clearly worrying. We expect the economy to contract for around 2 years in all, with a peak to trough drop in output of 1.5% or even more.\"</p> <h2>Richard Lambert, CBI director general</h2> <p>\"This figure is worse than we expected, with the slowdown spreading right across the economy. This confirms the findings of the CBI survey earlier this week, which showed a sharp deterioration in business conditions and confidence over the past three months.\"</p> <p>\"The government measures to support the banking system in recent weeks have shown themselves to be very necessary. Without them we would be in a far worse position. We must now focus on the policies that will take us forward to recovery in the future.\"</p> <p>\"Today's numbers support the view that the pace of inflation will fall rapidly. Business needs a further 0.5 percentage point cut in interest rates soon. Other policy initiatives also need to be urgently considered. Any plans that add to the cost of employment must be delayed to protect jobs.\"</p> <p>\"We must also find ways to stop small firms that are otherwise sound from being pushed over the brink, and to give people on the high street more money in their pocket.\"</p> <h2>Howard Archer at Global Insight</h2> <p>\"While contraction in the third quarter does not put the UK officially into technical recession yet (this is defined by two successive declines in quarter-on-quarter and the economy was flat in the second quarter) the depth of the decline means that we are there to all intents and purposes. </p> <p>\"Indeed, there can be no doubt that further marked GDP contraction will occur in the fourth quarter as consumers retrench in the face of major headwinds and investment is pared back sharply. While exports are benefiting from the weaker pound, this will be increasingly outweighed by very weak domestic demand in key overseas markets.</p> <p>\"We also expect further contraction to occur in at least the first two quarters of 2009 before the economy hopefully starts to gradually stabilize then improve. However, any significant recovery currently seems unlikely before 2010, and even then growth is likely to be below trend.\"</p> <h2>Richard Snook, senior economist at the CEBR</h2> <p>\"Today's figures will make grim reading for Gordon Brown, whose legacy for economic management has been seriously damaged by the current downturn. Mervyn King will be spurred into action, we expect the Bank to shave at least 100 basis points off interest rates before Christmas.</p> <p>\"Today's figure will put further downward pressure on sterling and equity markets.\"</p> <h2>Brian Hilliard at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</h2> <p>\"My comment to traders was dive, dive, dive. The problem is in services, that's what has done the damage. It's a very emphatic entry into recession which underlines the need for dramatic rate cuts which we think the Bank of England will deliver. We're looking for a 50 basis point cut in November and a rapid session of cuts to about 2.5% by the middle of next year. </p> <p>\"In services, the big fall is obviously business services and finance and at last we are getting the expected downturn in the retail sector with the decline in distribution, hotels and catering.\"</p> <h2>Steve Radley, chief economist at EEF</h2> <p>\"The question is not whether we are in a downturn but now how deep and prolonged it will be. Whilst pockets of industry are still holding up, large parts of the real economy are being hammered hard. Business and the consumer will now be looking to government and the Bank of England to step up to the plate and deliver a bold package of fiscal measures to help companies backed by further aggressive cuts in interest rates.\"</p> <h2>Philip Shaw at Investec</h2> <p>\"The fact that GDP contracted is no surprise but it's a big shock that the decline is as large as 0.5%. It's truly dire. <br>\"The big difference from the forecasts was the 0.4% decline in the services sector. News since the end of September has hardly been encouraging and the UK may well experience a recession that is significantly deeper that we had expected before.\"</p> <h2>James Knightley at ING</h2> <p>\"So much for Gordon Brown's \"no more boom and bust\". This is the first decline for 16 years and the largest fall since Q4 1990, but unfortunately we think this could be the first in a series of around four negative quarters of growth. </p> <p>\"So far we only have the industry breakdown which shows manufacturing falling 1% quarter-on-quarter and service sector output falling 0.4% quarter-on-quarter. Agriculture was the only component which saw a rise in output.<br> \"Our forecast for 2009 full-year growth had been -0.9% and we had been expecting the BoE policy rate to be cut to 2.75%, but these numbers will now be revised lower.\" </p> <h2>Shadow chancellor George Osborne</h2> <p>\"Everyone was expecting a bad figure but this is much worse. It shows that millions of British families are in for a very difficult time in the months ahead. Conservatives will do everything to help people cope.</p> <p>\"It is a defining moment in the record of Gordon Brown. The day that we can all see that the central claims he made over ten years, that he had abolished boom and bust and therefore didn't need to set aside money for a rainy day has been shown to be completely false.</p> <p>\"Sadly it will be millions of families, pensioners and companies that will pay the price for Labour's failure to prepare for this moment.\"</p> <h2>David Kern, at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC)</h2> <p>\"The third quarter fall in GDP was worse than expected. As envisaged by the BCC's recent quarterly economic survey, all areas of the economy recorded declines. But, the declines in services and construction were even larger than most analysts predicted.</p> <p>\"The economic outlook is serious. While it is important not to talk ourselves into a slump, urgent steps are needed to alleviate the worst consequences.</p> <p>\"Interest rates will have to be cut without delay to 4% in November, and to 3.50% shortly afterwards. Business taxes will have to be cut in the pre-budget report, and the government will have to insist that the vital flow of bank finance to small firms is maintained.\"</p>",
  "<p>We anti-conspiracy theorists have been mocked this week for suggesting there may be less than meets to eye to the yachtgate row, enjoyable though it has been for fans of Peter Mandelson, George Osborne and Oleg Deripaska (Russia's now-famous Mr Aluminium) - not to mention the novels of Evelyn Waugh.</p> <p>As the tale slips down the news agenda, at least until Sunday morning, it's prudent to ask: were we wrong? Earlier this week the official, off-the-record Tory line was that Mandelson had manipulated Nathaniel Rothschild into falling out with his old Bullingdon chum, Osborne, for betraying their August chit-chat.<br><br>We laughed at this, not unkindly, when we heard it from Conservative press officers \u2013 as we called them in more innocent days, before someone (possibly me) imported the self-promoting term \"spin doctor\" from the US in 1988. Did they really think even the Crown Prince of Darkness could sway such a rich, wild and worldly figure as the next Lord Rothschild, could persuade him to wreck an old and intimate friendship in so public a way?</p> <p>My working assumption was that - unless there were motives as yet unknown - this was essentially a social row that had got out of hand. By grassing up Mandelson when a guest of Rothschild, Osborne had embarrassed his Buller chum, as well as his yachtgate host and business partner, Mr Aluminium. Red faces all round, much anger, bad manners, bad form.</p> <p>The Tory tack has changed now. Today <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/2539376/osborne-stumbles-but-is-there-a-bigger-story-about-mandelson.thtml\">The Spectator</a>, the London <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23576973-details/The+\u00a35+billion+reason+Rothschild+knifed+his+friend+George+in+the+back/article.do\">Evening Standard</a> and its sister paper, the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1080165/Was-Osborne-knifed-Now-Mandelson-faces-questions-links-Russian-tycoon-plans-5bn-super-rich-haven-Montenegro.html\">Daily Mail</a>, plus others I can't afford because the FT is so expensive, all reflect the new line to take.</p> <p>It is to hint that it is really all about Deripaska's business empire, its ambitions, its current financial pressures (he needs to refinance loans in a global financial crisis) and the possibly sinister role in all this played by ex-EU trade commissioner Mandelson.</p> <p>Today's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/24/mandelson-labour\">Guardian plays a role in all this by revealing that Mandelson was seen dining with Mr Aluminium</a> in a Moscow restaurant as early as 2004, two years before the \"few social gatherings in 2006 and 2007\" mentioned in his statement; earlier too than reports of them meeting in 2005.</p> <p>This could prove significant, if more important developments surface. Meanwhile it's all grist to the conspiracy mill, which is now turning up photos of a hitherto little known port in Montenegro called Tivat. Apparently \"Hungary's biggest property developer\", a firm also called Tivat, co-owned by Nat Rothschild and a Canadian called Peter Munk, want to develop the old Yugoslavian naval base there as the new Monte Carlo.</p> <p>And Deripaska? He is apparently Montenegro's biggest employer (yes, it's aluminium), its Lord Ashcroft, you might say, in view of the Tory bankroller's mega-standing in Belize. According to the Mail, he makes the key calls to Montenegrin pols. </p> <p>According to the Standard, he also makes them to top politicos in places you've probably never heard of - like the remote Russian republic of Kalmykia, whose president promised in his campaign to buy every shepherd a mobile phone and sign up Diego Maradona for the local team. If only Gordon could be so imaginative!</p> <p>Lots of other Russian schemes, deep in the Wild East, are also mentioned. This is all great fun, wily foreigners with funny names, very probably with moustaches too. Sacha Baron Cohen will be found to have been on Mr Aluminium's vulgar gin palace, Queen K, if we search all the lifeboats. Lord Byron's name \u2013 always one to panic shareholders \u2013 has already been invoked. He passed through Tivat and liked it.</p> <p>So the real offence, so the new theory goes, must have been that Osborne inadvertently put Deripaska's name (try calling him \"Terry Pascoe\", it's easier) up in lights at a time when he is firefighting troubles within his empire: court cases, refinancing and stuff. The allegedly mooted \u00a350k donation was chicken feed. Proper money is at stake, not least in a complex court case over the disputed sale of Russia's second biggest insurance firm, Ingosstrakh. Mandelson's office became involved via MEPs who were supporting EU shareholders who blamed Deripaska when the value of their stake in Ingosstrakh was reduced.</p> <p>This may be important or it may be froth. It doesn't stop there: it never does. New Labour's Lord Byron (a fellow peer, did you notice?) apparently championed Montenegro's entry into the World Trade Organisation (WTO), an epochal event you may have missed. Nudge, nudge. I am beginning to see why Messrs Cameron and Osborne embraced the new American \"nudge theory\" last summer, though it was thought at the time to mean ways of persuading (but not instructing) voters to adopt better dietary habits.</p> <p>So, we are back where we were a month ago when Mandelson was recalled to the unByronic Brown cabinet. The papers are digging hard in search of conflict of interest, improper conduct and, failing all that, our old friend \"errors of judgment\" on Lord M's part (and Master George's). </p> <p>The diggers may yet turn something up, but before you invest in those costly Sunday papers, let alone put spare savings into buying land in Tivat, remember, they have had a month on the case already, with little to show for it except nudge, nudge. Perhaps the Nudge Hotel should be next to the Lord Byron when Tivat becomes the new Monte Carlo, or even the new Poole Harbour.</p> <p>As things stand, Mandelson has sustained some damage, though the spectacle of watching Sky News covering him making a business speech last night in Easington was a tribute to his box-office appeal. Osborne's flashily dangerous sense of style has also sustained more damage, though Dave is standing by him. Reports that William Hague is boning up to become shadow chancellor are premature. </p> <p>My hunch remains that Mandelson and Osborne will survive, albeit a little more shop-soiled. We'll see.</p> <p>Cameron, incidentally, is fingered in <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-murdoch-and-a-greek-island-freebie-971470.html\">today's Indy for using Matt Freud's private plane</a> to slip off from his Turkish hols to Santorini in Greece, where he paid court to Matt's father-in-law, Rupert Murdoch. New Labour is hardly is a position, alas, to protest at such grovelling. The Great Schmoozer's own gin palace was later moored off Corfu. </p> <p>Surely, at his age, Rupert should be careful on such boats. Remember how poor old Bob Maxwell slipped and fell. But that is not our concern. Result so far? Much fun and laughter at the expense of politicians with a weakness for bling, nothing more serious, not so far.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/24/corfu-party-funding-george-osborne\">Martin Kettle makes a good point in today's Guardian when he reminds liberals to temper their outrage</a>. Barack Obama has been raising vast private sums to outspend John McCain in the US presidential elections, some of it undoubtedly from very dodgy scumbags of all colours as well as widows' mites. Basking in media approval, he has done so with little complaint from his own side.</p>",

  "<p>Everyone now recognises the need to reform the international <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">economic</a> regime. But the idea should not simply be to fix a system that is obviously broken: we need to exchange it for a better model. That is because the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">current financial architecture has failed</a> in some very important ways. </p> <p>Most importantly, the international financial system has failed to meet two obvious requirements: of preventing instability and crises, and of transferring resources from richer to poorer economies. Not only have we experienced much greater volatility and propensity to financial meltdown across emerging markets and now even industrial countries, but even the periods of economic expansion have been based on the global poor subsidising the rich. </p> <p>These global failures are so immense that they constitute enough reason to abandon this system. But there are other associated failures in terms of what the regime has implied within national economies: it has encouraged pro-cyclicality; it has rendered national financial systems opaque and impossible to regulate; it has encouraged bubbles and speculative fervour rather than real productive investment for future growth; it has allowed for the proliferation of parallel transactions through tax havens and looser domestic controls; it has reduced the crucial developmental role of directed credit. </p> <p>So we clearly need a new system, even if the goals remain the same as that of the original <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system\">Bretton Woods</a>: to ensure currency stabilisation through international monetary cooperation; to encourage the expansion of international trade in a stable way; and to promote development by facilitating productive investment. </p> <p>To achieve this in the current context, four elements are crucial. First, the belief that self-regulation supported with external risk assessment by rating agencies is an adequate way to run a financial system has been blown sky-high. There is no alternative, therefore, to systematic state regulation of finance. </p> <p>Second, since private players will inevitably attempt to circumvent regulation, the core of the financial system \u2013 banking \u2013 must be protected, and this is only possible through social ownership. Therefore, some degree of the socialisation of banking (and not just socialisation of the risks inherent in finance) is also inevitable. In developing countries it is also important because it enables public control over the direction of credit, without which no country has industrialised. </p> <p>Third, to cope with the adverse real economy effects of the current crisis, fiscal stimulation is essential in both developed and developing countries. Enhanced public expenditure is required to prevent economic activity and employment from falling, to manage the effects of climate change and promote greener technologies, and to advance the development project in the south. </p> <p>Fourth, we need an international economic framework that supports this, which in turns means that capital flows must be controlled and regulated so that they do not destabilise any of these strategies. </p> <p>It may be argued that such an international system based on state regulation will reduce the possibility of developing countries to access much-needed capital for their own economic expansion. But this perception is wrong, because in fact the current liberalised system did <em>not</em> provide for a net transfer of resources to the developing world. In the past six years, there has been a net flow of financial resources from every developing region to the north, primarily the US, even as global income disparities have increased. And within countries, the idea that deregulated finance could put more resources in the hands of the poor (as in sub-prime lending) has proved to be unsustainable. </p> <p>So greater state involvement in economic activity is now both necessary and desirable. The time for arguing about whether to have it or not is over. Instead, we should be thinking of how to make such involvement more democratic and accountable, within our countries and internationally.</p>",

  "<p>The sky is falling. Capitalism is collapsing. Free enterprise has crapped the bed and rolled in it. Marxists are looking smug. Conservatives are thinking up imaginative new ways to blame everything on poor black people. Liberals are telling us that if we keep our chins up and hold hands everything will soon be right as rain again.</p> <p>And sports fans? I was on a train from Boston to Philly last week and the lass in the seat in front of me was nearly hyperventilating with glee as she recounted every pitch, swing and byzantinely sophisticated tactical decision in last night's humdinger of a preamble to the World Series in which the Boston Red Sox came back from 7-0 to win 8-7 in the 8th inning. </p> <p>I watched part of the game in a bar of a boutique hotel in the company of business folk who, as the game progressed, stopped whining like whipped dogs about how letting spivs run around making insane bets with gazillions of dollars of made-up fairy money had turned out not to be a very good idea after all (who knew?). Then their mood slowly swung from glum to dumbstruck to hugging-and-kissing-total-strangers delirious. </p> <p>Which is all by way of saying that I think sport will survive the ongoing economic apocalypse. It provides escapism. It produces storylines where David sometimes humbles Goliath. And, perhaps most importantly, it provides an arena where working- and middle-class people can gather to shout the vilest abuse imaginable at the totally out of touch millionaire scum who own, manage and play for the teams we subsidise. </p> <p>Like Gordon Brown \u2013 and, I'm guessing, like you \u2013 I am rather keen to see the rich suffer as a result of this crisis. And I'd also like to see the same rollback of privatisation and deregulation that we've seen in banking take place in football. I don't know if George W Bush's socialistic bailing out of Manchester United shirt sponsor AIG now means that some small portion of the club now resides in the hands of the US government. But that would be a start.</p> <p>And I also hope the current economic crisis leads to the collapse of the Premier League and the reinstitution of a four-division league run for and by the sport as a whole rather some faceless, soul-sucking spivocracy. </p> <p>In my wilder moments I see the government stepping in to nationalise the big four and the Old Firm \u2013 on the basis that these clubs are vital to the spiritual and cultural wellbeing of the British people and are thus far too valuable to be left in the hands of folk so demented they invented a financial system based on moonbeams. </p> <p>And I'd like to see the executive boxes turned into allotments. Just for starters. </p> <p>If this recession does deepen into the biggest depression since 1929, it's likely that suburban America will rediscover soccer as the simple and inexpensive game it is in most of the rest of the world. We might also see the withering of elite travel leagues that charge huge pay-to-play fees and thus all but ensure the non-participation of working-class families. Whether this will force suburban soccer to start looking towards the inner cities for players and opponents remains to be seen. But it could be the first step towards proletarianisation that the game in the States desperately needs. </p> <p>Ice hockey and American football will likely survive in the US \u2013 despite the huge cost of the equipment needed to play them. Gridiron in particular has vast phalanxes of partisans busy making sure the game keeps sucking cash out of the educational system at both school and college level. But it's also a safe bet that if hard times do roll around, grassroots gridiron will continue to lose ground to leaner, cheaper and (not an unimportant consideration in a country without free universal health care) way-less-likely-to-put-your-kid-in-hospital soccer and basketball.</p> <p>A big loser will likely be the so-called X-Sports \u2013 those equipment-based pseudo-sports some sociologists see as an unconsciously racist attempt by white suburbanites to find prole-free games where they won't get their asses handed to them on a regular basis by black kids. </p> <p>Will any specifically depression-era sports make a come back? Marathon dancing - as seen in the film They Shoot Horses Don't They? - would probably find it difficult to re-establish roots in a culture that has spent the last three decades eschewing proper dancing in favour of just letting it all hang out and jiggling about like a jellyfish with the collywobbles, man (notwithstanding the massive success of competitive pro-am dance shows on both sides of the Atlantic.)</p> <p>Curiously the three great American depression sports \u2013 pro wrestling, rollerderby and boxing \u2013 didn't wait for the new depression before reinventing themselves (the latter in the shape of mixed martial arts). </p> <p>Rollerderby \u2013 which has its roots in the 1930s \u2013 has dropped most of the nudge-nudge, wink-wink post-feminist mock-sexist gimmickry that marked its relaunch and has become an utterly thrilling proper sport that is way, way more exciting to watch live than baseball, American football (which it resembles in an exciting, speeded-up and less gay way) and basketball. And it's also starting to draw crowds from outside the hipster culture that gave it its rebirth. </p> <p>Bizarrely, big-time pro-wrestling might have already peaked. Many who were attracted to the oh-my-gosh silliness of the scripted sport's 21st-century relaunch were put off by the introduction of soap style storylines that stretched the acting abilities of the athletes to breaking point and beyond. </p> <p>But the good news is that many of those thus disaffected started \"backyard\" wrestling schools of their own. There's hardly a town of any size in America where one can't find a wrestling show featuring men dressed as Japanese supermonsters, or where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/mar/05/cricket.stevenwells\">unitarded dudes</a> (who apparently cannot afford either the steroids or the sunbeds) fight off an attack by \"a local ninja school\" using real baseball bats wrapped in real barbed wire caked in real blood. These guys probably wouldn't even notice a depression. </p> <p>But my big tip for the US sport that's set to go global if the economy prolapses? <a href=\"http://www.kickball.com/\">Kickball</a>. For the uninitiated (meaning everyone who has never attended an American high school) kickball is almost exactly like baseball except that its played with a large inflatable ball that is kicked, rather than hit with a bat. </p> <p>Now I know what you're thinking. And you are right. Both as a spectacle and a recreational activity, kickball is vastly superior to baseball (in fact the continued existence of baseball in the wake of kickball's invention puts one in mind of a lungfish that, having developed legs, steadfastly refuses to use them.)</p> <p>Kickball is one of those fantastic American things \u2013 like high school football marching bands and Title IX and garbage disposal units \u2013 that Americans don't realise are wonderful and thus never try to export. Instead they try to export gridiron, which is pointless if you've got rugby. And \"liberty\", which is actually (and this will shock most Americans) pretty widespread in Europe and actually much cheaper if you buy it from Sweden (although you do have to take it home and construct it yourself, which can be infuriating.) </p> <p>Americans, alas, are so blinkered by baseball and, as a rule, so incorrigibly provincial, that they'll probably never realise the glory of kickball. So I'll do it for them. </p> <p><strong>REASONS KICKBALL LIKE TODALLY ROCKS</strong><br>\u2022 You can play it equally well drunk or sober.<br>\u2022 It requires almost zero equipment.<br>\u2022 It combines the spending-most-of-the-game-hanging-around-with-your-mates-having-a-bit-of-a-natteryness of rounders and cricket with the visceral kickyness of soccer.<br>\u2022 It's totally co-ed. <br>\u2022 It's totally jock free. <br>\u2022 It's utterly devoid of willy-waggling gender baggage.<br>\u2022 So there are no needle-dicked nimrods desperately trying to prove that they're neither a homosexual nor a woman by being very, very good at a game. And shouting. <br>\u2022 Booze, sunshine, attractive young people of several genders and sexual orientations glowing with vodka and light exercise. And nobody gives a toss if you're rubbish. If they play a sport in heaven, it is kickball. </p> <p>I eventually give up trying to find a USAian who can step outside of their own USAishness for a moment and give me a quote on the wonderful and uniquely American Americanyness of kickball. You know - look at things like a foreigner. The very idea that there were countries where people don't automatically play kickball in the playground at break time seems to simultaneously shock and baffle American kickballers. Mouths freeze. Eyes glaze over. Arooga arooga sirens go off. Men in brown overalls arrive to carry them, stiff as a board, back to the depot for rebooting</p> <p>\"It's a game for drunks and incompetents,\" one sports journalist told me. \"And maybe amputees. I am appalled you are writing about it. I am ashamed I even know you. Don't use my name, I don't want anybody googling xxxx xxxxxx and kickball.\" </p> <p>I attended a kickball tournament in Philadelphia two weeks ago. The players were mostly young, bright, lower-middle-class 20-somethings in the not terribly well paid floppy white collar jobs that exist all over the US in the wake of 27 years of voodoo-Reaganomics. These are people who are hardly rewarded at all by the current economic system and who are thus unlikely to suffer any major trauma should that same system have a nervous breakdown. </p> <p>In short, the hipster sports \u2013 like alleycat bike racing and bike polo and kickball \u2013 that are played by the already economically disadvantaged and which eschew easily fossilised, top-down, workplace and/or geographic community based organisational structures, are superbly positioned to ride out an economic depression. </p> <p>Plus if a sport doesn't cost anything, there's no reason for anybody to cut it from their budget. The cheap will inherit the earth. </p> <p>Oh, by the way, the team that won the kickball tournament? They hung a hammer and sickle flag in their dug-out, wore red shirts and called themselves the Bolsheviks. End of history my arse.</p>",
  "<p>In yet another indication of the shifting priorities in international cricket, the boards of Australia, South Africa and New Zealand have announced plans for a new Twenty20 tournament. The competition would feature eight city-based, franchise-owned sides playing across all three nations. The inaugural edition is due to take place in 2011. It is a similar model to that used in the Indian Premier League. </p> <p>The eight sides would be split into two conferences, one based in Africa and the other in Australasia. The top teams from each conference would play off in the tournament finals. It would be scheduled to allow the competing players to also appear in the IPL, and it is understood that the Board of Control for Cricket in India have also agreed to make players available for the new competition. </p> <p>The boards of the three concerned nations have been in discussions about the idea for the past year. The tournament is the latest addition to an increasingly crowded roster, joining the World Twenty20, the IPL, the rebel ICL, the English Premier League, the Champions League and the multitude of Stanford competitions. The new tournament will not replace the countries' existing domestic Twenty20 tournaments. </p> <p>CA spokesman Peter Young addressed concerns over the crowding of the fixture list with assurances that the new competition \"will be short, sharp and very focused but the exact number of games is yet to be determined. Strategically we see that there's a finite amount of Twenty20 cricket that's likely to be ideal, with a number of major global blocks\".</p> <p>Justin Vaughan, chief executive of NZC, reiterated those ideas: \"The challenge for the three southern-hemisphere boards is to create the stage for that opportunity to be captured in a way which complements international cricket.\"</p> <p>It is initially thought that the competition would take place in October, and that the winning team would be entered into the Champions League competition. </p> <p>CA chief executive James Sutherland said: \"Regional-level T20 cricket played at the level immediately below international cricket has shown it can capture the public imagination and create new audiences for cricket. But as we have seen in India, it needs critical mass to generate major public excitement and the regional concept we have been charged with developing provides that critical mass.\" </p> <p>For cricket as a whole you sense the proliferation of Twenty20 tournaments means that a critical mass of a quite different kind may soon be reached, and the consequences for the future of the sport may be more dramatic than anyone now imagines.</p>",
  "<p>Toumani Diabat\u00e9's music is too blasphemous for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/sony\">Sony</a>. This week, the company announced a global recall of their LittleBigPlanet video game over fears that Diabat\u00e9's Koran-quoting soundtrack might offend some Muslims. And no one is more surprised than Diabat\u00e9, himself a devout Muslim. </p> <p>\"In my family there are only two things we know,\" Diabat\u00e9 told the BBC this week. \"The Koran and the kora,\" he said, referring to the Muslim holy book and the West African harp.</p> <p>The Malian musician has been widely celebrated for his kora music, collaborating with the likes of Bj\u00f6rk, Taj Mahal and Ali Farka Tour\u00e9. He records beautiful, glittering tracks, usually with guest vocalists. For the song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKT-07MKblc\">Tapha Niang</a>, which Sony used for LittleBigPlanet's soundtrack, the vocals consist of verses from the Koran.</p> <p>\"I don't want anybody to joke with Islam and to not respect Islam,\" Diabat\u00e9 said, explaining that in Mali it was normal to mix religion and music. \"I'm really sad and I'm disappointed.\"</p> <p>The think-tank Muslim Forum applauded Sony's recall decision. The direct words of God, they said, ought not to be used in music. </p> <p>Sony and the game's creator, Media Molecule, only became aware of the issue after being contacted by a Muslim game-tester. They then announced the global recall to ensure that there was \"no possible way anyone may be offended by the music in the game\", according to a spokesperson.</p> <p>It's not clear whether the new version of <a href=\"http://www.littlebigplanet.com/\">LittleBigPlanet</a>, which lets gamers design and play through 2D worlds, will be released with an amended version of Diabat\u00e9's song or with new music altogether. </p> <p>It will go on sale on November 3.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroness_Ashton\">Baroness Ashton</a>, welcome to your new position as EU Trade Commissioner. As an MEP an member of the trade commission, I am hopeful that we shall be able to collaborate successfully, especially on environmental and global justice issues.</p> <p>During the autumn of 2006 your predecessor, Peter Mandelson, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/issues/sectoral/competitiveness/global_europe_en.htm\">presented</a> the strategy document, Global Europe. Many of us were surprised at the excessive demands for deregulation of trade and the opening of global markets to European companies. Global Europe, seen as the Lisbon strategy's external dimension, was shaped by the commission's staff in close cooperation with European big business and their lobbying organisation in Brussels, <a href=\"ttp://www.businesseurope.eu/Content/Default.asp\">Business Europe</a>. </p> <p>Global Europe is a very aggressive free trade strategy which aims to open markets around the world as well as to secure stable access to cheap raw materials for the European industry. But it is also a push to dismantle a variety of social and environmental regulations in third countries which EU corporations currently have to comply when trying to enter new markets. </p> <p>However, Global Europe goes even further and strives for the deregulation of sectors such as services, investment, public procurement and competition policy, and enforcing tougher intellectual property rights which will benefit EU-based transnational companies. The EU is thus trying to implement a policy which has already been rejected in the WTO. At the centre of the Global Europe strategy is a new generation of regional and bilateral free trade agreements, where the EU in particular is targeting key countries with emerging economies.</p> <p>The EU is fond of speaking about the conditions and priorities of poor countries. But actions speak louder than words. The EU's current trade policy is clearly contrary to sustainable development, and stresses the commercial interests of big business over the fight against poverty and for fair trade rules. A significant part of the reason for this is the presence of Business Europe and its influence on the setting of the Union's trade policies.</p> <p>The intimate relationship between the Directorate-General for Trade and Business Europe has long been a cause for concern. But the fact that the collaboration has now advanced and been made more concrete is more than a little worrying. It is, in fact, very distressing that Business Europe is organising the conference \"Going Global\" on October 28 in the commission's own premises in Brussels, with the participation of several commissioners, for the purpose of evaluating Global Europe. This sends dangerous signals to the citizens of Europe at a time when the Union's legitimacy is already questioned by many with diverse perspectives.</p> <p>This can hardly be in line with the impartiality that is meant to be the natural character of the commission. Baroness Ashton, you have a golden opportunity to correct the situation. I strongly encourage you to:</p> <p>1. Treat Business Europe as the lobbying organisation that it is.</p> <p>2. Remove Business Europe from your premises at the Charlemagne building. They can afford to rent an office on the local property market.</p> <p>3. Join the fight against poverty and for sustainable development through closer cooperation with developing countries and aid organisations in Europe.</p>",
