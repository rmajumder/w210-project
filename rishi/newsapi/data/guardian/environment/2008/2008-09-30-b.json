  "<p><strong>\"Considering the strife of certain top-flight sponsors, have there been any instances of a sponsor leaving a club in the lurch with disastrous consequences?\"</strong> wondered Mike Hulse, a week or two ago.</p> <p>XL's demise has caused West Ham some trouble and strife, with the possibility of a \u00a330m payout over the Carlos Tevez affair compounding the financial implications of the travel company's collapse. The Hammers, though, are not alone. In fact, they're in rather good company.</p> <p>Real Madrid lost their sponsor BenQ after the company went bankrupt during the 2006/07 season, just over a year into a five-year deal. The Spanish giants, however, aren't short of a couple of quid, rode out their troubles, and signed a new \u20ac60m deal with gambling company Bwin at the end of the season.</p> <p>Parma, Cup Winners' Cup winners in 1993, Uefa Cup winners in 1995 and 1999, faced financial ruin after the Parmalat scandal broke in Italy. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/11/football.italy\">The ruin of the Tanzi family</a> and of the club led to a player exodus, with Alberto Gilardino among those leaving, and the side went from top-half contender to a relegation battler, a fight that they finally lost last season.</p> <p>In England Charlton Athletic have led the way in backing the wrong horses in the advertising stakes. When their shirt sponsors all:sports went into administration in September 2005, the Addicks signed up with Spanish property company Llanera, who proceeded to go to bust 2\u00bd years into a 4\u00bd-year \u00a36.6m deal. Llanera still advertise their links with the south London club on their crumbling, spiderweb-strewn <a href=\"http://www.llanerainmobiliaria.com/enlaces/charlton.htm\">website</a>.</p> <p>And Nick Byrne, not unreasonably, points to the turmoil caused by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/aug/02/broadcasting.citynews\">collapse of ITV Digital</a>.

The stream of tales of footballing philanrthropy shows no sign of drying up.</p> <p>This week's most impressive suggestion comes from Oliver Jordanovski. \"Check on Per Mertersacker of Werder Bremen,\" writes Oliver. \"He commits both time and money to fight poverty. I hear he spends one day a week doing menial jobs for shelters, charities, etc.\"</p> <p>We did check and though we couldn't find any corroborating evidence for such largesse, <a href=\" http://www.permertesacker.de/\">his official website</a> confirms he has done volunteer work in a \"closed institution for the mentally completed\" (according to our ropey online translation). We also found passage that translated as \"I do not find that I am a girl swarm\", which we feel it is necessary to share.</p> <p>\"Due honor has to be given to Javier \"Pupi\" Zanetti, the Argentinean player,\" writes Juan Carlos Guataqui. \"Together with his wife they run the <a href=\"http://www.fundacionpupi.org/v.2003ing/aplaceforsolidarity.htm\">Pupi Foundation</a>, a very well-known charity for poor children. Zanetti has organized exhibition matches with famous players and usually puts in auction the shirts that he gets on exchange at the end of his matches.\" Also with his own charity is Liverpool's Dirk Kuyt. <a href=\"http://www.dirkkuytfoundation.nl\">The Dirk Kuyt foundation</a> helps support and organise sports for people with disabilities.<br> As Alex Warwick and Sean Galvin write to tell us, Redondo was unable to play due to injury for more than two years after signing for Milan in 2000. He suspended his \u00a32.74m-a-year salary and also, apparently, tried to give back the house and car that the Rossoneri had presented him.</p> <p>In a less spectacular but no less meaningful example, Kris Boyd, according to Fraser Mann, \"waived half of his \u00a340,000 signing on fee\" after his move to Rangers, helping to fund the Kilmarnock youth set-up that helped further his own career. And, finally, in a similar vein to Niall Quinn, Gary Kelly also donated the entire proceeds of his Leeds United testimonial to charity. \"His sister had died from cancer and the proceeds went to various cancer charities and hospices in Ireland and Leeds,\" wrires Owen Lennard. The proceeds also went towards the creation of the <a href=\"http://www.gkcancersupport.com/\">Gary Kelly Cancer Support Centre</a> in Drogheda.</p> <p><strong>CHINA'S (1948) OLYMPIC ADVENTURE</strong></p> <p><strong>My late uncle was a footballer playing for pre-communist China. He always boasted that he participated in the 1948 London Olympics. Was there a Chinese football team? And if so, have you got any details of the team and how did they do?\"</strong> wrote Rebecca Yau a while back.</p> <p>Good news, Rebecca, your uncle was not a fibber. The Republic of China did indeed send a football team to the London Olympics in 1948, though sad to relate, their success was limited. They lined up for their first round match against Turkey at midday on August 2, 60 years ago, at the home of football, Green Pond Road, Walthamstow. They finished up on the wrong end of a 4-0 walloping, but were saved from any embarrassment by the USA's 9-0 capitulation to Italy hours later. </p> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197049/matches/match=32359/report.html\">wearing the No5 shirt</a> in that defeat was Man Chi Chau, Rebecca's late uncle. The team line-ups, goalscorers and all the other results can be found in <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197049/results/index.html\">Fifa's excellent archive</a>.</p> <p>It would only be fair to note the football team's achievement in simply lining up at the Olympics. The Chinese government gave next to no funding to its Olympic delegation. In order to secure the finances to fund their Olympic journey, the football team embarked on a 32-match tour of Asia, pocketing their share of gate receipts as they went. The delegation even brought with them their own food, to save on inflated prices in postwar Britain.</p> <p>The Chinese Olympic team that year featured 33 athletes, all of them male, none of whom made it beyond the preliminary stages of their event. The delegation was then forced to borrow money to make it home. It would be fair to say that state funding for Chinese athletes has seen something of an increase in the last 60 years. </p> <p><strong>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Has a team ever been 'mathematically certain' of winning the title, only to be deducted points and see it go elsewhere?\"</strong> asked Conor Green back in those innocent days of 2005.</p> <p>Actually it has Conor, two seasons on the trot in Yugoslavia back when Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia were still part of the the federation. In 1985-86, the domestic FA ordered the final round of league fixtures to be replayed amid accusations of match-fixing. Partizan Belgrade, who had actually won the title with a 4-0 victory over Zeljeznicar Sarajevo, refused to play the match again. Zeljeznicar were then awarded the game 3-0, handing Crvena Zvezda [Red Star Belgrade] title glory. They even played in the European Cup the following season, before a series of legal decisions restored the original standings with Partizan recognised as champions in 1987. </p> <p>Both Red Star and Partizan began the next season with a six-point deduction because of the previous season's events [along with eight other clubs]. Vardar Skopje, who hadn't suffered any penalty, won the title, themselves taking part in the following season's European Cup. But the original deduction was later annulled courtesy of further legal wrangling and with their points tally fully restored, Partizan picked up their second championship in a row.</p> <p>For many more sepia-tinged questions and answers, why not visit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\">the Knowledge archive</a>.</p> <p><strong>Can you help?</strong></p> <p>\"Paul Doyle suggested on a recent MBM that a potential Newcastle-Tottenham shoot-out could be the worst ever and end nil-nil - it got me thinking, what is the worst penalty shoot-out there has ever been?\" wonders Mike Gibbons<br> \"Financially-contstrained Brighton's victory over Man City got me thinking - I remember reading last year that Glenn Murray was the most expensive player Brighton had signed since Terry Connor joined in 1983 (as part of a swap deal with Andy Ritchie) - does any club have a longer standing most expensive player record?\" asks Ben Peachey </p> <p>Send your questions and answers to <a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">knowledge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Public art has the power to reinvigorate the environment, engage the community, lend existing buildings a new lease of life and reap rewards for the economy through tourism. But when badly-executed, such projects can be \"gunge\", as sculptor Antony Gormley neatly put it earlier this year.</p> <p>Gormley's 65ft-high Angel of the North statue in Gateshead is acclaimed as one of the finest examples of public art in the country, but what are the hallmarks of so-called \"plop art\"? \"I hate it when you can tell where the art ends and building begins,\" says Sarah Gaventa, director of Cabe Space, the public-space arm of design watchdog the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. \"There's nothing sadder than seeing art as an addon and not part of creating places.\"</p> <p>According to Gaventa, among the less successful examples of the genre \u2014 although not because of the artist \u2014 was Michael Pinsky's The Lost O. The temporary project last year turned an Ashford ring road into an art space. Installations ranged from subverted road signs to bells on churchyard sheep that chimed when they moved. \"It was a wonderful project, but it didn't ever have the buy-in from local councillors and there was a problem for Pinsky in the curating role, which was a real shame,\" says Gaventa. \"I'd say don't do a public art project if you're not going to respect the artist.\"</p> <p>Success in public art means watertight concepts and commissioning, adds Maggie Bolt, director of Public Art South West (PASW), the organisation that runs the national resource Public Art Online. \"Unsuccessful work can normally be traced back to a timid commissioner. A lot of what we do at PASW is to try to nurture creative commissioners.\" </p> <p>Bolt says projects fail if aspirations are low, the scope and role of the artist is too prescriptive and expectations unrealistically high. Other problems include a selection committee that compromises by going for a mediocre artist who won't \"offend\", as well as limited funds and an insistence that \"everything is approved by everyone\".</p> <p>According to Bolt, successful spaces do not have any obvious public art \u2014 they just work well. She is a fan of Richard Wilson's Turning the Place Over. The sculptor cut an oval-shaped section from the facade of a derelict Liverpool city centre building and fixed it to a rotating pivot, allowing passers-by to look inside. \"It's a radical architectural intervention \u2014 set on such a scale and location that it really creates an impact and enlivens the public realm through intrigue and inventiveness.\"</p> <p>Gaventa praises the work of Grey World in Dublin. Its Urban Samples installation, for example, used material such as gravel and placed it on plinths that, when touched, created music reflecting the material's original location. \"Public art isn't clinical,\" says Gaventa. \"It's about playfulness and the joy that can be brought to our public spaces.\"</p>",
  "<p>Banks of glass-fronted residential apartments, shiny new shopping malls, creative industry quarters, art galleries and museums recycled from old industrial buildings, a piece of \"iconic\" public art: these have become the stock-in-trade features of the revitalized English city in recent years, from Newcastle to Birmingham.</p> <p>Throw in a bit of social history and a bit of popular culture \u2014 a football stadium fit to grace the Premier League, say, or a state-of-the art concert venue \u2014 and there you have it, a shiny, thrusting new municipal identity. Anywhere, it seemed, could buy-in these core elements and get itself an off-the-shelf makeover. Retail, leisure and consumption have been the sparkling face of these ambitious visions.</p> <p>\"This town will not believe it is on the up until it has its own Starbucks,\" a Midlands regeneration executive told me a couple of years ago. He knew that the key factor in the town's resurgence would not in fact be the opening of a global brand coffee shop but a new train station, with a fast link to the nearest metropolis. But his point was that the area \u2014 a slightly depressed post-industrial town with a \"1980s\" high street \u2014 had to glitter, to entice, to prove not least to its own skeptical habitants that it could hold its own in the modern consumer hierarchies of shopping.</p> <p>Never mind the observation of the New Economics Foundation (Nef) in its 2004 report, Clone Town Britain, that too many English towns regenerated in this way have \"lost their sense of place and the distinctive facades of their high streets under the march of glass, steel and concrete blandness of chain stores built for the demands of ... a string of big, clone town retailers.\" Retail \u2014 particularly if a big metropolitan brand could be tempted out into the sticks \u2014 was a badge of economic purposefulness and success.</p> <p>Alongside the shopping was a vogue for imagined physical reinvention on a grand creative scale. Architect Will Alsop's unrealized 2003 vision of Barnsley town centre as a 21st-century walled Tuscan hill village, complete with golden halo projected hundreds of feet into the sky above the south Yorkshire mining community, is perhaps the most memorable example of this. \"If we can just make this town beautiful, people will come,\" Alsop told the BBC.</p> <p>The credit crunch and the collapse in the buy-to-let mortgage market, however, have dealt a blow to the idea that yuppy flats, dramatic new architecture and an upmarket retail presence alone could reinvigorate an area and its public image. Even Leeds, which has thrived over the last decade on the back of a financial and legal services industry, has found itself with a glut of empty one- and two-bed apartments in its city centre, a victim, some say, of an unwise faith in a development strategy aligned more with the interests of property investors than the likely demand from local residents.</p> <p>Leeds, as it happens, may be in a stronger position than most to ride the downturn; like Manchester, its investment in diverse, knowledge-intensive industries, alongside the physical transformation of its city centre, gives it a resilience that other cities may not enjoy. The idea of an off-the-shelf municipal makeover, a \"like-Manchester-but-smaller\" regeneration package, now looks unfeasible, especially for those so-called second-tier cities such as Bradford, Preston, and Stoke. It is not that the \"cultural offer\" elements of city regeneration are redundant, just that they must be more carefully applied, and accompanied by astute investments in transport, economic infrastructure (including universities and healthcare) and skills.</p> <p>As Michael Ward, chief executive of the British Urban Regeneration Association puts it, refurbishing a city is a process, not a moment. \"All these elements \u2014 the apartments, the shops, the art \u2014 have worked somewhere at sometime over the past 20 years. But you have to keep on reviewing and reinventing.\"</p> <p>But how do you reinvent, capture and maintain distinctiveness? Not simply through eye-catching new buildings. Nef has drawn up guidelines for preserving distinctiveness: redevelopments must be owned (in the cultural rather than legal sense) by local people; developments must be authentic and rooted in history and communal memory. The texture of a place, says Nef, is as important as its economic assets. \"Above all,\" it says, \"distinctiveness is not neat; it is not marketing.\"</p> <p>The Work Foundation has emphasised the importance of devolving political power to cities, and of nurturing strong and locally accountable city leadership with a clear strategic idea of how to make the most of economic opportunities.</p> <p>The late Tony Wilson, pop music impresario turned regeneration specialist, produced a typically bold vision for Burnley, and its surrounding east Lancashire towns in 2005, drawing heavily for inspiration on its social and industrial history. This was a story \u2014 in parts whimsical \u2014 of Phillipe Starke-designed allotment sheds, football theme parks, a fashion tower, of \"Pennine Lancashire\" (as he branded the area) becoming an affordable place to live for \"young creatives\". But it also recognized Burnley's crucial economic dependence on Manchester (and the importance of Connectivity \u2014 a reopened rail line that would underpin that relationship).</p> <p>Dermot Finch, director of the Centre for Cities thinktank, believes the ambitions of most English cities will in future have to be more modest and realistic. \"The second-tier cities must understand what their financial and economic assets are. It may be that they do not have, say, sufficient scale in creative industries, or a compelling retail offers.\"</p> <p>Scaling down the vision may prove an uncomfortable blow to local pride, he says, but it is essential: \"Everyone wants to be a 'world class x, y or z'. But that's not how to develop an economic strategy.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org\">neweconomics.org</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.centreforcities.org\">centreforcities.org</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bura.org.uk\">bura.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Just 10 years ago, cities were seen as vital contributors to the global economy. That's no longer true. Today, cities are the global economy. More than 50% of the world's population live in cities and the 40 largest cities, or mega-regions, account for two thirds of the world's output, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/01/cities.richard.florida\">according Professor Richard Florida</a>, an urban studies theorist at the University of Toronto.</p> <p>A report published by the independent research consultancy, the Work Foundation, at its Ideopolis conference in July, says the last 10 years of economic growth in the UK tell a story of the knowledge economy, and one which has played out in our cities. With every new job in other industries being matched by 12 new jobs in knowledge-intensive industries between 1995 and 2005, the cities attracting these industries are the ones that have boomed.</p> <p>In our Future of cities web special, we aim to explain how the expansion in cities of knowledge-intensive industries, from financial services to hi-tech manufacturing, has reshaped the UK economy. We show how successful cities have attracted skilled workers, affluent consumers and thriving cultural centres. And we demonstrate the importance of political mechanisms in providing strong but measured city leadership.</p> <p>Yet cities are similar to any industry that globalises: they create winners and losers. At the same conference, the foundation published a league table of the productivity of 56 UK cities revealing wide and growing disparities between \"resurgent\" cities and those that appear to be \"stuck\".</p> <p>So we also examine the challenges and opportunities facing our cities, carry competing Labour and Conservative visions for the future of our cities, and ask urban experts how cities can compete but also collaborate so as to thrive in the global economy.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Why are cities becoming more, not less<br>important?</strong></p> <p>Every period has its own geographic expression, such as the agricultural village, mercantile town, factory town, industrial city etc. But the current geographical remaking is global.</p> <p>We've identified 40 cities, or megaregions, that have become the growth poles of the world economy, sucking up resources not only from their countries, but from the world. And for every thriving burgeoning city, there's a declining city. Young kids who used to work in the downtown hubs of Pittsburgh, Detroit and Cleveland are now moving to Chicago. If Chicago pulls its talent from all over the mid-west, London and New York pull talent from around the world.</p> <p><strong>Doesn't technology reduce our reliance on cities?</strong></p> <p>At the very time that technology should allow us to decentralise, we're becoming more concentrated in urban centres than at any point in human history. Thomas Friedman [author and New York Times columnist] has this idea that the world has been \"flattened\" \u2014 and yes, lots of economic activities are decentralising. But lots of others, particularly the high value added ones, are recentralising.</p> <p>I talk to people every day who have tried to live in rural areas, but they had to move back; they needed to be part of a network in order to develop work, customers and clients.</p> <p><strong>Cities can't carry on growing larger, can they?</strong></p> <p>You'd think cities would hit diseconomies of scale such as congestion and expensive housing. Economists would expect a city to decentralise, but the great cities speed up their metabolic rate to defy the previous generation's imagination. The advantages and densities and concentration of people outweigh the diseconomies.</p> <p><strong>Any advice for urban planners?</strong></p> <p>When cities try to have top-down plans they usually wreck themselves. When I lived in Pittsburgh, almost every neighbourhood that was interesting was one that the city had either ignored or that the residents had protected. Just like Toyota became the greatest car company in the world by tapping the knowledge of its shopfloor workers, the best cities are those that tap the knowledge and energy of their residents to continuously build neighbourhoods.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Florida is a professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

  "<p>Want to turn your location into a destination? Try branding it. Successful branding, says Robert Jones, consultant director at international brand consultancy Wolff Olins, can turn a city into a place where people want to live, work and visit. A strong identity is vital if you are vying with other places for attention in tourism and business or relaunching an area after a regeneration initiative.</p> <p>However, branding is not a magic wand to mask a city's problems. \"The brand has to be based on what is already there in a city or else it is just like giving someone a nice haircut \u2014 it might look good for a while, but it doesn't give you a new personality,\" says Marcus Mitchell, strategist at branding agency Corporate Edge. So what makes a well-branded city, and which places are the most successful? </p> <p>Our panel of four experts give their opinions:</p> <p><strong>Robert Jones</strong>, consultant director, Wolff Olins<br><strong>Jonathan Gabay</strong>, founder, Brand Forensics <br><strong>Michael Hamilton</strong>, founder, The Hamiltons <br><strong>Marcus Mitchell</strong>, strategist, Corporate Edge</p> <h2>Which cities have successful brands?</h2> <p>Most great cities have a brand that's developed organically \u2014 Paris around romance, or Hong Kong around trade. For many cities, it's impossible to sum up the brand in a word \u2014 they're multi-dimensional and also changing. So trying to create city brands artificially is a dangerous and, sometimes, presumptuous business. New York has succeeded at this with \"I love New York\" and the more recent NYC work. So has Glasgow.<br><strong>RJ</strong></p> <p>New York is probably the world's greatest branded city. The brand key is integration and direction. That is driven by a combination of single-minded leadership about what New York is: an eclectic mixture of people, all of whom, regardless of sex, age or creed, have the potential to realise their dream \u2014 if they work at it. NYC means a \"can-do\" attitude that manifests itself in everything from towering skyscrapers to customer service. This combination is so admired that it seamlessly gets branded on anything from a baseball cap to a coffee mug.<br><strong>JG</strong></p> <p>Liverpool, Edinburgh and Paris are successfully branded cities. They ooze the most culture. Liverpool has had an incredible turnaround in terms of its politics and physical deprivation. It's such a thriving city \u2014 with clubs and bars, a financial centre and retail \u2014 so there's something for everyone. Any tourist or business visitor wants to have a sense of where a city's heartbeat is, and that's what I get from these cities, along with a sense of pride and dramatic architecture.<br><strong>MH</strong></p> <p>Sydney has maximised what it could from hosting the 2000 Olympics but did so in a coordinated way across business, tourism and in developing a profile for the whole city. New York and Glasgow have both, over decades, used a series of campaigns to get people to reassess what they're about. The roots of \"I love NY\" was in the 1970s when the city wanted to instil pride in itself and get across the idea that New York was somewhere you'd want to visit.<br><strong>MM</strong></p> <h2>Which cities have failed as brands?</h2> <p>Belfast has recently announced a logo, but it's not clear what the brand idea behind it is.<br><strong>RJ</strong></p> <p>As a Londoner, I am ashamed to mention London. Everything about brand London is turning into a disaster. From unfocused brand values \u2014 what exactly does London stand for in 2008? \u2014 to poorly managed transport, policing and environment, and disenfranchised communities. New York's brand reflects progress; Brand London speaks of uncertainty. That was best exemplified by the logo for the 2012 Olympics: disjointed and crude.</p> <p>Jerusalem also needs a rebrand. The ancient \"golden crown\" capital city of the world's major religions has become synonymous with the centre of the world's biggest question mark. Rather than try to be everything to all people, every brand must have a single-minded purpose. In Jerusalem's case, anyone who shouts loud enough somehow feels entitled to have a claim on Jerusalem's brand meaning.<br><strong>JG</strong></p> <p>There's lots on offer in Birmingham, but it's still in the shadow of Manchester and Leeds. Bristol's got a fantastic location, with access to London, the south-west and Wales, with a mixture of tourism, industry and large corporations based there, but it's not really exploited its assets.<br><strong>MH</strong></p> <p>Toronto doesn't have a strong identity and is dwarfed in branding terms by other cities like Vancouver and Montreal. The city's brand, Toronto Unlimited, was launched in 2005, but it hasn't really linked the different faces of the city \u2014 its tourism and its business \u2014 nor capitalised on its nature as a 24-hour city.<br><strong>MM</strong></p> <h2>What are your tips for branding a city?</h2> <p>Start by working on reality, not image \u2014 do the regeneration, the investment, the transformation first, and only when change is visible should you start to \"brand\" it.<br><strong>RJ</strong></p> <p>Branding a city is not just about the logo but the intricate details \u2014 as small as clean streets and as deep as getting a city's residents to feel proud to be brand ambassadors. When citizens are proud, visitors are encouraged to find out what the fuss is all about and then tell the world.<br><strong>JG</strong></p> <p>Look at the key assets. The magic formula is to make something about the city tangible and make people switch on to that \u2014 location, for example.<br><strong>MH</strong></p> <p>Branding isn't just about one logo or a strapline, it's about coordinated activity and a joined-up approach to attract all the city's audiences. Your brand needs to address the tourist who may come one year and then next year have a child who is due to study there. Photography is also difficult because it's hard to capture the spirit of a place. Visit Britain, the tourism agency, has done some great work in building up a special and freely accessible photo library that captures the essence of personality and place.<br><strong>MM</strong></p>",
  "<p>Just 12 months ago, eco-towns were at the forefront of the government's plans to build more new homes and reduce carbon emissions. But now, with the credit crunch biting hard and the housing market in real trouble, their future direction looks uncertain. Ministers should shift their green focus to existing buildings \u2014 both residential and commercial \u2014 which together account for around half of the UK's carbon emissions.</p> <p>Gordon Brown first announced ecotowns just over a year ago \u2014 before the housing market entered its downturn. Fifteen sites have been proposed, and up to 10 are due to be shortlisted. Five are planned by 2016, and up to 10 by 2020, with each containing between 5,000 and 20,000 homes. But those numbers now look difficult to achieve \u2014 as does the government's overall target of three million new homes.</p> <p>The intentions behind eco-towns are fine \u2014 to be a model for high-quality, low-carbon new housing, and to encourage developers to be innovative with new design techniques. Yet from the outset, the government's plans have been heavily criticised; even its own Eco-Towns Challenge Group recently singled out several of the proposed schemes for harsh criticism.</p> <p>There are several concerns with ecotowns. First, they are marginal and will provide only a fraction of the new housing our economy needs. For every five houses built in eco-towns over the next decade, we will need to build another 95 elsewhere. And they will make only a small impact on reducing carbon emissions. All our towns and cities should be eco-friendly, not just these new eco-towns.</p> <p>In fact, eco-towns will take longer to complete than many think and could well be delayed by the housing slump. Some developers are already scaling back their eco-town plans. This looks set to scupper the government's ambition for eco-towns to be a \"template\" for all other new housing.</p> <p>Some eco-towns are not on track to be built in the right places and could actually increase carbon emissions. Bordon and Whitehill in East Hampshire is one of the better ones, adding 5,500 homes to a town that already has 15,000 people and its own infrastructure. But Coltishall in Norfolk is not well connected; and Hanley Grange in Cambridgeshire is near to transport links that are over-stretched. Eco-town residents there could be several miles away from jobs and essential services, and so they will rely heavily on their cars. That doesn't make sense.</p> <p><strong>Tighter public spending</strong></p> <p>Housing minister Caroline Flint has promised that eco-towns will have \"outstanding public transport\" and that \"effective links with existing settlements will be a prerequisite\". But with public spending getting tighter, I'm not sure we'll be able to afford all those outstanding public transport links.</p> <p>So how can we ensure that eco-towns deliver their share of new housing and a reduction in carbon emissions? Critically, the government and developers should look to the long-term. The downturn presents an opportunity to get the model right. Ministers and the housebuilding industry now have some extra time to refine and perfect their plans\u2014- so that when the market picks up, they are ready to roll.</p> <p>Meanwhile, ministers should avoid the numbers game. Quality, not quantity should be their goal. The final shortlist should include only the best and most viable schemes. One excellent eco-town will be better than 10 dodgy ones.</p> <p>All eco-towns should be built to the highest environmental and design standards, and in the right places. Flint should stick to her promise that all eco-towns will have excellent transport links. Ideally, they should be closely connected to existing urban areas with jobs, infrastructure and facilities already in place. If built in the right places, with good transport links to local jobs, eco-towns could become the exemplar that we all want to see.</p> <p>Meanwhile, if the government really wants to reduce carbon emissions, it should focus much more on the existing built environment \u2014 responsible for half of the UK's emissions.</p> <p>The government has committed to achieving a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050. With new houses only a small percentage of total stock each year, most existing housing will still be in place by 2050. And as commercial buildings are responsible for one-fifth of all carbon emissions, we need to pay far more attention to making all our existing buildings greener.</p> <p>It's not just new-build, and it's not just houses. The all-party parliamentary group for urban development recently recommended action to reduce the carbon footprint of Britain's existing offices, shops and factories. Some quick energy savings could be made quite easily there \u2014 by switching lights off, installing better insulation and more efficient air conditioning. Commercial landlords and their tenants could do more together. In Bradford, for example, a local shopping centre has cut energy use by 20% simply through better dialogue between owners and occupiers.</p> <p>These simple measures aimed at existing buildings are less exciting than new eco-towns but have the potential to deliver far more real and immediate carbon reductions.</p> <p>Finally, the worsening economy could actually help. Faced with rising energy costs and other pressures on their bottom line, homeowners and businesses have an added incentive to go green. Ministers greener cities through simple energy conservation measures. That would achieve more impact in the long run than a few eco-towns.</p> <p>\u2022 Dermot Finch is director of Centre for Cities</p>",
  "<p>The north-south divide has a long history in England, culturally and economically. But as recently as 2004, figures have shown the gap between the average economic output of England and its three northern regions had grown to \u00a330bn. This has given great cause for concern and has led to the launch of an initiative called the Northern Way, a partnership between three regional development agencies aimed at boosting the economic development of eight city regions in the north.</p> <p>But while this gap exists, people are recognising another economic dividing line that runs diagonally across the country, from below the Humber in the east to the south-west coast. It forms what Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at the University of Sheffield, calls \"a \u00a3100,000 cliff in house price rises\". With a few exceptions, the gap is effectively between London and the greater southeast, and the rest of the country.</p> <p>Why does this matter? Shouldn't we be content with our strong economy radiating out of the south-east and leave well alone? Yes, it has an impact on equality of economic opportunity, but can't we just leave the market to sort it out?</p> <p>In fact, the overheating of the southeast economy has become a worry \u2014 and it has serious environmental implications too \u2014 but the words \"eggs\" and \"one basket\" also come to mind given the current economic climate.</p> <p>Quite rightly, we hear a lot about the importance of London's economy, but what is less well known is that the combined economies of England's eight regional \"core cities\" and their surrounding conurbations \u2014 city regions \u2014 are actually greater than that of London, contributing 25.5% of national output. Their total population is 16 million, one third of England's total; they account for 18% of the workforce and 25% of those people qualified to degree level or above.</p> <p>This isn't an either-or argument; our cities need London. But it does give a sense of relative scale, and the message is clear: there is another economy out there that can do as much, if not more, for England \u2014 and we ignore it at our cost. At a moment of downturn, the entire UK needs to be firing on all cylinders.</p> <p>The urban policy narrative in England has shifted dramatically over the past 10 to 15 years, from seeing cities as problems (the seat of social terror and economic nightmare) to viewing them as solutions to the economy, society and the environment. Cities are being recognised as the most sustainable places to live, and offering the best chance of dealing with disadvantage. They clearly drive the economy, with some of the core cities accounting for more than 50% of their region's entire output.</p> <p>But some cities in England are struggling to close the productivity gap, creating a further dividing line between places that might be neighbours. Internationally, things look bleaker still. A 2006 report, State of the English Cities, by a group of city experts led by Professor Michael Parkinson, showed that out of the top performing cities in Europe, England had only three in the top 50. France had five, Italy six, while Germany had a staggering 15 in the top 20.</p> <p>Across the great divide then, but the report had two important lessons for thriving cities. First, the most successful European cities enjoy more devolved arrangements than those in England, particularly financially. Here we are heavily centralised and cities directly control only about 5% of the total taxation raised in them \u2014 council tax. Among our competitors, this can be 40-60% and more. They have freedom to decide on local priorities, act quickly to take opportunities and resist economic shocks.</p> <p>Second, they have a tradition of operating across functional economic areas \u2014 city regions. Increasingly, we live and work in a way that takes no account of administrative boundaries; economic and business flows also follow these patterns. The most successful places integrate their strategies for housing, economy, transport and spatial planning at this level.</p> <p>We have seen much progress in recent discussion about empowering cities by devolving finances and control. The forthcoming sub national review of economic development and regeneration is about to conclude, hopefully, in this direction; the empowerment white paper makes proposals for more local democratic engagement; and the Lyons inquiry has made suggestions for empowering local government as \"placeshapers\".</p> <p>As a group, the Core Cities Group \u2014 Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield \u2014 have been working positively on these issues with the government, RDAs and the Homes and Communities Agency \u2014 an important new player in housing and regeneration. However, change has yet to be felt at local level.</p> <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p> <p>One of the biggest issues cities face is paying for their needs and ambitions at a moment of downturn and decreasing public spending, particularly to finance major infrastructure.</p> <p>With PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Core Cities Group has produced a report that demonstrates how cities might use innovative approaches, allowing borrowing against future income to pay for schemes that generate the proceeds in the first place.</p> <p>Interim findings suggest that such an approach could greatly increase economic outputs, housing units delivered and jobs created in some schemes. It could be used to fund transport projects and climate change measures. At the end of the borrowing period, it would also create a greater return to the Treasury from receipts that would not otherwise exist.</p> <p>But perhaps the starkest and most persistent economic split in England is neither north-south nor east-west. It is between individual cities \u2014 those that have benefited from prosperity and those that have not. The personal difficulties caused by worklessness and a \"cycle of disadvantage\", often concentrated in small areas, cannot be underestimated. It also has an effect on local economies, reducing the workforce, constraining output and productivity and straining public spending. Ultimately, it has an impact on quality of life and quality of place, two factors that, in a knowledge economy with highly mobile businesses, give big competitive advantage.</p> <p>There is some exceptional work taking place but, if we want to reduce economic disparity in England, as well as looking at important regional divides, we need to do more within individual places. In some of our cities, up to 22% of the population have no qualifications. Increasing skill levels can bridge the gap between disadvantage and economic opportunity, but programmes are more likely to succeed working alongside plans for housing, economic development and transport.</p> <p>Which brings us back to devolved control and integration across the real economic geography. It might sound like \"economyspeak\", but allowing cities to play their full economic role will help their citizens and communities have more fulfilling lives.</p> <p>\u2022 Chris Murray is director of the Core Cities Group</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/\">communities.gov.uk/publications/</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gregclark.net/\">citiesandregions/state4</a></p>",
  "<p>There are multiple reasons why the current economic crisis is so toxic, but one additional, \u00adaggravating factor is that it is unfolding five weeks away from a US election. The disruptive effect of that was clear on Monday, when the US House of Representatives voted down President Bush's bail-out plan \u2014 a function of both his dead-duck status and the fears of 228 Congressman seeking re-election next month. The result is that the stakes in the contest between Barack Obama and John McCain, already stratospheric, have just got higher. The winner will be charged with leading the world through this economic \u00adconvulsion and steering us all to safety. The current polls have Obama in front, but this contest could go either way.</p> <p>Those of us on the outside will \u00adfollow every twist; it is a statement of the \u00adobvious that the entire world will be watching on November 4. But perhaps we shouldn't be. At least if my email inbox is anything to go by, we should have only the scantest interest in the ongoing US election. After all, it's got nothing to do with us.</p> <p>Or, as one emailer put it: \"We are electing the President of the United States and the world can choke on it.\" His was one of a deluge of mainly hostile responses to a column that appeared here three weeks ago, arguing that the world's verdict would be harsh if Americans chose McCain over Obama. In their thousands, Americans wrote to tell me they read my words not as a simple prediction of the consequences of an American decision broadly to maintain the Bush-Cheney approach \u2014 but as some kind of threat. I was not merely commenting on the US election, they said, but intervening in it, seeking to blackmail American voters with the threat of global ostracism (as if I'm in a position to issue such a threat). </p> <p>The counterblasts featured all the usual themes familiar to any columnist or blogger who wades into this terrain. America had saved Europe's \"ass\" twice before \u2014 and we would doubtless come bleating for help again when we inevitably sought rescue from the Muslim hordes imposing sharia law on London, Paris and Berlin. We can't defend ourselves, of course, because we are limp-wristed \"Euroweenies\", effeminate socialists whose own decline robs us of the right to say anything about the United States, which remains the greatest nation on earth. </p> <p>Britain specifically forfeited the right to meddle in US affairs more than two centuries ago, when it lost the War of Independence. Besides, Obama is a Marxist, so Europe is welcome to him. One Bill07407 managed to capture the flavour of this virtual avalanche \u2014 including the curiously homoerotic undercurrent that runs through much rightwing American invective \u2014 with this effort: \"If you want Comrade Obama we will gladly ship him over after he loses in a landslide. Meanwhile you can kiss my ass. I bet you would enjoy it faggot.\" Equally reflective, this from bioguy777: \"I love it! A pansy-ass limey Brit begs the US to do his bidding while his own country slips further towards total Islamic rule. We're electing McCain, and the rest of the world can piss up a rope if they don't like it. 1776, BITCH!\"</p> <p>In among the abuse were three \u00adarguments that need addressing. The first is that this election has nothing to do with those of us outside America (so \"butt out\"). The trouble is, it has plenty to do with us. That has been true of every contest since 1945, when the US emerged as the sole superpower in the democratic world. But it has been undeniable since 2001. </p> <p>Take Britain. Our soldiers have fought in two wars, Afghanistan and Iraq, that were wholly conceived and planned in Washington. Sure, it was Tony Blair's choice to take part in the invasion of Iraq, but that meant following a decision that had been made by an American president. No one doubts that had George W Bush decided the other way, Britain would not have gone to war in 2003. </p> <p>If not blood, then treasure. The financial crisis now devouring British banks bears a three-word stamp: \"Made in America.\" It was the US fad for sub-prime loans, handing out money to would-be homeowners who were not creditworthy, that triggered the credit crunch and, with it, the current turmoil. Yesterday President Bush acknowledged that its impact would be felt outside US borders when he sought to \"assure our citizens and citizens around the world\". Never was the hoary cliche truer: they sneeze and we catch a cold. </p> <p>If war and economic meltdown aren't sufficiently persuasive, then how about a planetary emergency? The US is a first-rank contributor to the problem of climate change, responsible for a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, despite having just 5% of the world's population. But, as \u00adThomas Friedman argues in his new book, Hot, Flat, and Crowded, the US is also indispensable to any solution. Only a radical transformation of America's approach to energy \u2014 generating it more cleanly and using less of it \u2014 could establish the kind of model and foster the technological innovation that would set a lead followed around the world. </p> <p>So, Americans who say that since they don't poke their nose into our domestic affairs we should stay out of theirs, are making a bogus comparison. The battle of Brown v Cameron won't affect them. But the battle of Obama v McCain will affect me and every other Briton, \u00adEuropean and citizen of the world. It could determine whether we are at peace or war, whether our \u00adeconomy thrives or enters a depression. This is not a mayoral election in rural Bulgaria, a purely internal matter of interest only to the locals. It damn well is our business.</p> <p>What's more, Americans would not have it any other way. They like to define their president as the \"leader of the free world\". So why is it such a cheek if the free world shows some interest in who that leader will be? Americans, you can't have it both ways: either you're the global superpower, in which case the world has a stake in your future direction, or you're not. But you can't act like \u00adAmerica and expect to be treated like Liechtenstein: it doesn't work that way. </p> <p>The second charge to be defeated is that to talk like this is somehow anti-American. The \u00adreverse is true. For what is prompting non-Americans to follow the \u00adcurrent election so closely is not just an acknowledgement that the US is the dominant force in international life, but a yearning for America to lead once more. I saw that clearly in the crowd of 200,000 that greeted Obama in Berlin in July. They wanted to feel about an American president the way their parents had felt about John F Kennedy, to be awed once more, as Bill Clinton puts it, by the power of America's example, not the example of its power. And, for most non-Americans, that means an end to unilateral wars and a moral lead on climate change \u2014 not a continuation of the past eight Republican years. </p> <p>Lastly, those Americans who say they don't give a \"rat's ass\" what the rest of the world thinks are letting themselves and their country down. America was never meant to be a closed, introverted nation, turning its back on the world. It has always aimed to inspire the rest of us, to be a shining city on the hill. In these autumn weeks, the world is \u00adlooking to the city once more, hoping desperately that the light is not about to fade. </p> <p>freedland@theguardian.com</p>",
  "<p>The world will have to take drastic action within two years to reduce greenhouse gas pollution if it is to avoid the worst effects of climate change, a new study warns.</p> <p>Weeks before world leaders meet to discuss the next big international treaty on cutting emissions, the scale of risk posed by failing to act rapidly is spelt out today by the UK Met Office's Hadley Centre.</p> <p>The study shows that cutting global emissions by 3% a year from 2010 offers the only possible hope of avoiding a global temperature rise of more than 2C - widely recognised as the threshold beyond which the worst impacts of sea level rise and drought become a significant risk.</p> <p>In the early years, at least, responsibility for such deep cuts in emissions would have to be borne by the UK and other rich countries, which are responsible for most of the historic build-up in emissions. </p> <p>It raises the prospect of far-reaching changes, including a rapid spread in community renewable energy and wave and tide power, improvements in public transport, big shifts to cycling and walking and changes in diet. It would also lead to huge pressure for the UK to abandon plans for a third runway at Heathrow and new coal-fired power stations.</p> <p>The warning from the Hadley Centre is likely to cause widespread concern, especially as the Met Office has a reputation for taking a cautious approach. It advises the UK government, the United Nations and other governments and businesses.</p> <p>Writing in today's Guardian, Vicky Pope, the Met Office's leading adviser on climate change to the government, warns that failure by governments to agree to \"large and early\" cuts or to meet those targets in future \"could have worrying and significant consequences for the world's climate\".</p> <p>Such a deal will be regarded as all but impossible by many experts as the 2010 deadline is soon after a big international meeting in Copenhagen in December next year, when the UN hopes a treaty will be signed.</p> <p>Andy Atkins, executive director of Friends of the Earth, said: \"Tactically we have to point out the opportunities and make it clear to them we have to act.\"</p> <p>Others called for the Met Office's warning to spur the UK and other countries to more urgent action at the big UN meetings in Poznan, Poland, in December and in Copenhagen at the end of next year, when a replacement for the Kyoto protocol is due to be agreed. </p> <p>So far, leaders of the G8 group of leading industrial nations have signalled support for a 50% cut in emissions, but have not pledged higher targets for their own countries. </p> <p>\"The new science should raise our ambition levels rather than [make us] back off,\" said Paul Cook, advocacy director of the development charity Tearfund. \"It's a big shift but it's do-able.\"</p> <p>The Hadley Centre analysed three possible agreements to cut global emissions, ranging from \"early and rapid\" to \"late and slow\" cuts, and compared them with what would happen if no action were taken. It found that if cuts begin in 2010 and quickly reach 3% a year then the most likely mid-range forecast temperature rise would be 2C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. This is based on cutting emissions by 50% globally by the middle of the century, as advocated by the UN and accepted by many national governments. </p> <p>By comparison, an \"early but slow\" decline, beginning in 2010 but at a more modest level of 1% a year, would lead to likely temperature rises of 2.9C by the end of the century, and a \"late and slow\" decline beginning in 2030 would generate likely temperature increases of 4C by 2100.</p> <p>At 2C, scientists have warned that at least one fifth of species are at risk of extinction and 1 to 2 billion people could suffer increased water stress; above 2C plants and soil significantly reduce the amount of carbon they absorb; and above 4C experts warn there is a danger of passing a \"tipping point\" at which methane release from permafrost and the collapse of big ice sheets accelerate the problems.</p> <p>The Met Office's researchers also looked at what would happen if reductions began later but were then steeper: \"It looked very like the 'early but slow' [scenario],\" Pope told the Guardian. The reason delays cause greater impacts is that in the intervening years carbon would build up in the atmosphere, where it remains for a century.</p> <p>Even more worrying than the \"most likely\" central projections are the \"worst case outcomes\", says Pope. Even for the optimistic \"early and rapid\" cuts there was a chance the temperature could rise by 2.8C - and any delay in making cuts ran the risk of the global thermometer coming close to or exceeding the crucial 4C figure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338146091\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/09/30/EMISSIONS2_0110.gif\" alt=\"EMISSIONS2_0110.gif\" width=\"476\" height=\"526\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Professor Bob Watson, chief scientific adviser for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said the results showed the urgency of an international agreement at the UN's conference in Copenhagen. \"If we act now, maybe we have got a fighting chance,\" he said.</p>",

Hull City have left a deep mark on his psyche. </p> <p>Having appeared distant in his post-match addresses, after the 2-1 defeat, if brutally candid about his players' collective shortcomings, the Frenchman sat down with a group of journalists at the club's training ground on Monday and unburdened himself some more. The thrust of his criticisms were that his young players had been guilty of complacency and a lack of focus. They hit the newspapers yesterday morning but there was still heavy fire before this <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a> group tie against <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/porto\">FC Porto</a> got underway, in the shape of his programme notes.</p> <p>Wenger wrote that the Hull result had been precipitated by a \"careless attitude in some departments\", that \"in key areas, we were not combative enough\" or \"mobile enough\". \"You cannot say the punishment was not deserved\" and \"when we are the favourites, we cannot turn up with the right level of concentration\". Bizarrely, he finished by appearing to contradict himself: \"If we were caught on Saturday, it's not due to a lack of care.\" He seemed all talked out as he brooded on the bench in the opening exchanges here, not looking particularly relaxed. The gauntlet, though, had been thrown down to his players: \"What is important is how we respond.\"</p> <p>There was no danger of any complacency this time. It is not Arsenal's way to declare, in the style of Peter Kenyon, the Chelsea chief executive, that they need to win a couple of Champions League titles to be considered a global player. They are rather more discreet. Yet the desire for a first European Cup burns inside of them. Their recent near-misses have hurt.</p> <p>There was a conviction about Arsenal from the off and a ruthlessness that once they had struck, they wanted to do so again. And again. There was an incisiveness about Theo Walcott and Samir Nasri, and a dynamism about the running on the overlap of Bacary Sagna and Ga\u00ebl Clichy. Wenger described Cesc F\u00e1bregas as \"outstanding\". The desire to prove individual and collective points was manifested in a sharpness of thought and movement.</p> <p>Porto did not appear the obliging visitors for the opening half an hour. They might have prompted the playing of a different script had Cristi\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez's downward header not hit the crossbar and Clichy not cleared off the line from Lisandro. There were jitters in the Arsenal defence.</p> <p>But the first-half goals were soothing and had Wenger out of his seat, smiling warmly. Relief was surely among his emotions. \"Maybe this was our most complete team performance of the season,\" he said. \"It was the response I wanted. Actually, it was half of the response, the other half is on Saturday [at Sunderland]. I expect to win the group from here. It is down to your memory how quickly you can forget [Hull] ... it is part of the learning process.\"</p> <p>Wenger had threatened to make changes to his starting XI, ratcheting up the pre-match tension among his players. In the event, though, with home victories so vital, he deemed it no time for examples and his only alteration was inviting back Nasri, who was fit again after a knee injury, in place of Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9. Nasri appears to be a fixture in Wenger's strongest line-up and Arsenal had balance with him on the left, rather than a right-footed player shoehorned into the role.</p> <p>What had made Saturday's shock so seismic was that Arsenal rarely lose at home and when they do, it is generally to well-established opposition. Of the 17 Premier League defeats that Wenger has suffered during his 12-year tenure at the Emirates and Highbury, nine have been to Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and more robust vintages of Newcastle United.</p> <p>Indeed, only three of them were to teams which finished the season in the bottom half of the table. Those results had previously been the ones that induced the cold sweats - the 0-1 against West Ham United two seasons ago; the 2-4 against Charlton Athletic in 2001-02 and the 0-3 against Middlesbrough in 2000-01. Hull, however, usurped such lows and shrieked humiliation at the club.</p> <p>Wenger, though, could enjoy himself back at the scene of Saturday's wreckage and reflect that his psychology had had the desired effect. Arsenal threatened to run riot in the second half and it was all so easy on the eye. The Gunners do not want for swagger and when it is allied to relentless levels of concentration and purpose, the results can be devastating.</p> <p>At 4-0, showboating time, the substitute Nicklas Bendtner tried to be too clever, trod on the ball and fell over. Wenger dissolved into fits of giggles on the bench. What a difference 90 minutes can make.</p>",

Ofcom itself estimates that by the time the analogue TV signal is switched off in 2012, the cost of ITV fulfilling its public-service obligations will outweigh the benefits by \u00a360m. </p> <p>Unions have attacked the plan and accused Ofcom of weakness for refusing to stick up for the rights of viewers in the regions. Luke Crawley, assistant general secretary of the broadcasting union Bectu, accused Ofcom of merely \"regulating for profit over quality public-service broadcasting\".</p> <p>\"This is a devastating blow to staff across the ITV regional news network,\" he said. \"In defending our members we cannot rule out the possibility of industrial action.\" </p> <p>Paul McLaughlin, national broadcasting organiser for the National Union of Journalists, also warned of possible strike action. </p> <p>\"Unless ITV meaningfully engages with unions over its plans for the future of regional news, industrial action seems inevitable. Any attempts to force through these massive cuts will be met with strong resistance.</p> <p>\"Viewers will doubtless be asking how a regulator required by parliament to maintain and strengthen public-service broadcasting is allowing this to happen.\"</p> <p>ITV's chief operating officer, John Cresswell, said cost reductions are crucial to protect ITV's turnaround plan, which hinges on its \u00a31bn programming budget. \"We are committed to a self-help, self-funding solution to securing ITV's future. In order to sustain our investment in UK content, we have to keep on top of our cost base.\"</p> <p>In the summer, as the depth of the advertising downturn began to emerge, ITV announced plans to save \u00a335m by 2010, on top of the \u00a341m it has saved since 2006. The company has been restructuring its finance, press and publicity as well as brand and commercial operations. It has also taken the axe to its global content business after warning in August that it would miss its four-year target of \u00a31.2bn in revenues by \u00a3200m. ITV aims to reach its target of cutting 1,000 jobs by February. The changes have already cost 425 jobs, with a further 75 in consultation.</p>",
  "<p>When it comes to climate change, the scientific evidence has to be at the core of any decision-making. Governments need to understand the consequences of choosing particular targets, but they also need to understand what will happen if targets are missed or if they cannot be agreed on by all countries. Failures could have far-reaching consequences.</p> <p>The latest climate model projections from the Met Office Hadley Centre show clearly that such failures could have worrying and significant consequences for the world's climate. Even with large and early cuts in emissions, these projections indicate that temperatures are likely to rise to around 2C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. If action is delayed or is slow, then there is a significant risk of much larger increases in temperature. The uncertainties in the science mean that even if the most likely temperature rise is kept within reasonable limits, we cannot rule out the possibility of much larger increases. Adaptation strategies are therefore needed to deal with these less likely, but still real, possibilities.</p> <p><strong>Temperature rises</strong></p> <p>Jason Lowe, a climate scientist, and other colleagues at the Hadley Centre have conducted a series of \"what if\" climate projections, to give a better understanding of the temperature rises we could expect if action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is slow or delayed.</p> <p>In the first scenario, emissions continue to rise throughout the century. In the other scenarios, emission reductions have been imposed at various times and at various rates.</p> <p>In the most optimistic scenario, emissions start to decrease in 2010, and reductions quickly reach 3% per year. This contrasts sharply with current trends, where the world's overall emissions are increasing at 1% per year - faster than even the worst cases used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emissions scenarios.</p> <p>What is very clear is that some increase in temperature is inevitable in the next century, and that the decisions and actions that the world takes now will have a profound impact on the climate later this century. </p> <p>Even if emissions start to decrease in the next two years and reach a rapid and sustained rate of decline of 3% per year, temperatures are likely to rise to 1.7C above pre-industrial levels by 2050 and to around 2C by 2100. This is because carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere will be around for many years to come and the climate takes some time to respond to these changes. Only an early and rapid decline in emissions gets anywhere close to the target of 50% reduction in emissions by 2050 put forward by the G8.</p> <p>Contrast that with a world where no action is taken to curb global warming. Then, temperatures could rise as high as 7C above pre-industrial values by the end of the century. This would lead to significant risks of severe and irreversible impacts.</p> <p>Lowe's two other scenarios are also significant. The consequences of a late decline in emissions are apparent by 2050. Delaying reduction of emissions until 2030, results in a further 0.5C of warming by 2050 compared with early, if slow, reduction from 2010. By the end of the century the differences are even greater - more than 1C.</p> <p>The consequences of an early but slow decline in emissions of 1% per year, compared with a rapid decline, appear to be small in 2050. However, they increase to 0.8C by the end of the century. </p> <p>Overall, a delayed and slow decline in emissions would probably lead to nearly 2C more warming than an early and rapid decline in global emissions - a total temperature rise of 4C above pre-industrial levels.</p> <p>The implications of these levels of temperature change are very serious, but the central projections are not the only things we should be worried by. When commentators look at these projections, they tend to concentrate on the most likely temperature rises. However, if we are concerned about keeping to a minimum the risks of avoiding dangerous climate change, we should also consider the worst case outcome. This will occur if the climate turns out to be particularly sensitive to increases in greenhouse gases and the Earth's biological systems cannot absorb very much carbon.</p> <p><strong>Dangerous impacts</strong></p> <p>The risks for worst case outcomes amplify much more quickly than the risks for most likely outcomes. For an early and rapid decline in emissions, the worst case outcome is around 0.7C higher than the most likely temperature rise. With much slower action taken much later, the difference between the most likely and worst case outcome is almost twice as wide, at 1.2C. This takes a worst case temperature rise of less than 3C to one just above 5C by the end of this century, bringing with it significant risk of dangerous impacts to our environment, society and economy.</p> <p>A major reason for this amplification is the so-called \"carbon cycle effect\". Plants, soils and oceans currently absorb about half of the carbon dioxide emitted by humankind's activities, limiting rises in atmospheric CO2 and slowing global warming. As temperatures increase, this absorption is very likely to decrease. </p> <p>For example, plant matter in the soil breaks down more quickly at higher temperatures, releasing carbon more quickly, and amplifying the warming trend. Methane released from the thawing of permafrost will add to the warming. This methane release is currently not included in the calculations, and becomes more of a risk for larger temperature rises.</p> <p>Hence, the risks of dangerous climate change will not increase slowly as greenhouse gases increase. Rather, the risks will multiply if we do not reduce emissions fast enough.</p> <p>\u2022 Vicky Pope is head of climate change for government at the Met Office's Hadley Centre.</p>",

  "<p>A revolutionary plan to produce green fuel from the jatropha plant has passed a major test by delivering its first shipments.</p> <p>D1 Oils, the British company behind the scheme, says it is well on the way to reaching its target of producing 1,000 tonnes of crude jatropha oil by December. \"We are pleased to have demonstrated through the delivery of our first crude vegetable oil the potential of jatropha as a biofuel crop,\" said Lord Oxburgh, the former chairman of Shell who is now chairman of D1.</p> <p>Jatropha had proved itself to be an alternative fuel source that did not compete with food crops for available land or threaten biodiversity because it could be grown on marginal arable land and can be irrigated by waste water, added Elliott Mannis, chief executive of the firm.</p> <p>\"D1's position as a leading developer in jatropha plant science differentiates us significantly in a market that increasingly requires biofuels that are not only competitive but also sustainable,\" said Mannis, whose firm has brought in BP as a joint venture partner.</p> <p>The plants are grown on plantations in Zambia and India. The seeds are crushed locally and sold for tractor fuel and other uses at $1,400-$1,500 (\u00a3790-\u00a3840) a tonne.

  "<p>Bill Clinton will today officially set aside wounded feelings that arose from the Democrats' long and bitter primary contest as he heads out to Florida to hold his first rally for Barack Obama.</p> <p>It comes more than a month after Clinton's emotional endorsement speech at the Democrats' convention and amid new speculation about whether he really wants Obama to win the White House.</p> <p>Clinton's potential to inflict damage on Obama's prospects was underlined again yesterday when John McCain released a new television ad using a clip of the former president to attack the Democrats.</p> <p>Clinton's two appearances in the politically volatile Orlando and Fort Pierce areas mark his first in the general election season.

  "<p>The government's plans to extend to 42 days the time limit for detention without charge will receive a further blow today from the Council of Europe. A report for the council will raise \"serious doubts\" about the compatibility of the proposals with European human rights legislation.</p> <p>The critical report comes in the wake of last week's claim by the former head of MI5 Dame Stella Rimington that 42 days was an excessive time for a suspect to be held without charge. </p> <p>The plan to increase the detention time limit from 28 to 42 days faces rejection when it goes to the House of Lords after the summer recess.</p> <p>The council's parliamentary assembly's committee on legal affairs and human rights concluded that it had \"serious doubts as to the compatibility of certain elements of draft counter-terrorism legislation in the United Kingdom with the requirements of the European convention on human rights and the Strasbourg court's case law.\" </p> <p>The committee found that detention of terrorist suspects for up to 42 days without charge, with limited judicial review, \"can lead to arbitrariness\", which would be in breach of articles on the right to liberty and security and a fair trial.</p> <p>It added that \"the proposed legislation is unduly complicated and is not readily understandable\". </p> <p>The report, which is due to be debated tomorrow, also contained tacit criticism of the government's tactics in its conclusion that \"terrorism must be fought with means that fully respect human rights and the rule of law, excluding all forms of arbitrariness. Injustice breads terrorism and undermines the legitimacy of the fight against it.\"</p> <p>A separate - but equally damning - report by the council's committee for the prevention of torture (CPT), adds fuel to the criticisms, with an attack on the conditions in which terrorist suspects are being detained at Paddington Green police station in London, in what has been described as a \"very austere environment\". </p> <p>The report warns that conditions at the 1960s station, which a parliamentary committee has previously described as \"plainly inadequate\", are placing detainees at risk of ill-treatment, and singles out minimal access to natural light and less than 20 minutes' exercise in a cordoned-off section of the car park as matters of concern. </p> <p>Although a spokesman for the Metropolitan police accepted that \"improvements are needed\" in response to the criticisms at Paddington Green, the government has broadly rejected the council's recommendations. </p> <p>The Home Office also defended its increased use of video links for court hearings, which the CPT also criticised in its report as inadequate to fulfil the requirement of suspects having their detention authorised by a judge. </p> <p>Hugh Chetwynd, a spokesman for the CPT, said: \"In our experience the first few days of detention is the time when detainees are at their most vulnerable. It is essential that a judge can make a proper assessment of their wellbeing, as is the case for all other criminal defendants except those detained under the Terrorism Act.\" </p> <p>The Home Office insisted that the use of video links, which will continue under the new counter-terrorism bill, was a \"cost-effective and expeditious\" alternative to bringing detainees before a judge in person.</p> <p>The government's rejection of the council's findings has further provoked critics of the new legislation. \"Britain once used the Council of Europe to promote fundamental freedoms in younger democracies,\" said Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty. </p> <p>\"It is embarrassing in the extreme that this same council should have to tell a UK government why it's wrong to imprison people for six weeks without charge.\"</p>",
  "<p>There was a moment in the first episode of the new Jamie Oliver TV series last night when the Essex-lad-made-millionaire had an outburst worthy of a revolutionary. Emerging from a mealtime visit to Natasha, a single mother on benefits in Rotherham, he raged in his own inimitable language of protest: \"Fucking hell ... it's fucking Great Britain. It's 2008. I've been to Soweto and I've seen Aids orphans eating better than that.\"</p> <p>Natasha feeds her two children takeaways most nights. Aged five and two, they have never eaten a meal that has been properly cooked at home. Instead, they sit on the floor - no table, no cutlery - and eat shavings of doner kebabs or chips with processed cheese from polystyrene boxes with their fingers. Even instant noodles have to be negotiated without forks. The bottom drawers of Natasha's fridge are stuffed full of sweets and chocolate bars. \"This is where all my money goes,\" she admitted. About \u00a370 out of a weekly benefits cheque of just \u00a380 on fast food and junk. Five-year-old Kiya has already had to go to the dentist twice to have rotten teeth removed. Natasha can see the life of obesity and illness ahead of them; it's not that she doesn't share the middle-class fantasy of sitting down to a cosy communal table each night, but despite her eight-hob gas cooker and the countless cookery shows on her flatscreen TV, she doesn't seem to know what to do. </p> <p>Whenever Oliver leaves her, in this and subsequent episodes of his TV mission to teach the nation to cook, he is stirred to the same outrage, shouted from the barricade of his celebrity jeep. Natasha turns out not only to have a big cooker and TV but debts large enough to make her a pawn-shop regular, and depression deep enough to make her give up trying. When Oliver finds this out he confides to the camera in his car, \"I don't blame her ... but I'm fucking angry. I'm fucking angry and I don't know who with or what with.\" He has just met poverty in all its 21st-century complexity - and it has a profound effect. </p> <p>Miss this Ministry of Food series and you'll be missing some of the most powerful political documentary in years. In it, whether by intention or accident, the naked chef has entered the domestic life of a British town and captured a snapshot of the country's social health. The result is an indictment of the current political system as disturbing as any ideological tract. Food, and real people's experience of it, is still all about class. </p> <p>The subtext is everything. Geoff, the 84-year-old Rotherham man who has never cooked in his life, seems keen and quick enough. Why he should suddenly be facing a crisis is never fully explained. But it turns out that his wife and lifelong helpmeet now has Alzheimer's disease and so everything is falling to him. He asked Citizens Advice where he could learn to cook. They had no answer. Does he have children to help? Yes, several, it turns out, but presumably distance and some of the longest working hours in Europe make it hard for them to give the support he needs. Clare, who is overweight and lives on 10 packs of crisps and a large bar of Galaxy chocolate a day, seems to struggle to read when given a recipe by Oliver. Is she one of those who fell through the net at school so that not only does she not know that liquids bubble when they boil but she stumbles when literacy and numeracy are required? This is a delicate but painful portrait of the socially excluded.</p> <p>Middle-class people in the series eat junk, too. Time, or lack of it, is their problem. Women getting home from work can't find even half an hour to cook from scratch for the family, which Oliver can't understand. There are cultural barriers to eating well too. But what makes Oliver and the viewer angry, what shocks, is the deprivation. </p> <p>Food has always been about class in Britain. \"The nature of our diets has been entirely shaped by the class system of the 19th century and the white working-class experience of industrialisation,\" says Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University in London. \"From the first- when cheap white bread was sold to the poor as progress, because previously only the rich could afford it - what class you are from, and how much you have to spend has made a dramatic difference to what you eat, how you eat it and what you aspire to eat. Class imbues everything in food.\" </p> <p>Which socio-economic class you are born into is still one of the most significant determinants of how healthy you will be. Natasha is simply conforming to the pattern. Her mother was a single parent on benefits too - she didn't pass on cooking skills to Natasha, and Natasha has none to give to her own children. The cycle of deprivation looks set to continue. Sharp inequalities can be clearly mapped, even short distances apart, according to Dr Tim Lobstein, director of the childhood research programme at the International Association for the Study of Obesity. Travel the eight stops on the Jubilee line tube from Central London's Westminster to Canning Town and you find a decrease in life expectancy of nearly one year for each station going east. </p> <p>A child born in one deprived Glasgow suburb can expect a life 28 years shorter than another living only 13km away in a more affluent area, a three-year investigation for the World Health Organisation found in August. Commenting on one of the key factors, the report concluded: \"Obesity is caused not by moral failure of individuals but by the excess availability of high-fat, high-sugar foods.\" The marketplace can generate wealth but it can \"also generate negative conditions for health\", which will only be resolved by tackling \"the inequitable distribution of power, money and resources\", it went on. In Rotherham, where areas around the town centre have deprivation levels that put them in the worst 6% of the country, one in 10 reception-age schoolchildren are obese. By year 6, 18% of them are obese, while 60% of adults are either overweight or obese. </p> <p>Right across the country, those on low-incomes suffer higher incidence of a whole range of illnesses relating to poor diet. Lobstein catalogues them: higher rates of anaemia caused by lack of iron, especially in pregnancy. Mothers from low-income groups are also more likely to have children of low birthweight, who, in turn, are likely to suffer poor health and educational prospects as a result. Working-class families have more dental disease and more childhood eczema and asthma. They are more likely to suffer from obesity, both as children and as adults. They have higher rates of raised blood pressure, thanks to excess salt in their processed diets. They are more likely to suffer diabetes, heart disease, vascular disease and strokes. They suffer more cancers of the lung, stomach and oesophagus. They have more cataracts caused by poor nutrition than those in other classes. And the protective role of good diet is missing. A survey of men and women living on benefits found that a third ate no fruit at all during the week their diets were recorded. </p> <p>It's not just diet, of course - alcohol and tobacco consumption are implicated, too, as poverty ties a Gordian knot of health problems. Over half of younger children in low-income groups are inactive almost all day as well, with two- to 10-year-olds getting less than 30 minutes of physical activity daily. </p> <p>Elizabeth Dowler, professor of food and social policy at Warwick University who was recently involved in the government's Low Income Diet and Nutrition survey, says the class differences are stark but complicated. \"If you live for more than six months on the minimum wage or on benefits there is growing evidence you cannot afford to buy the food you need for health. It is still to do with class but it's complex to unpick. Food is the flexible area that you cut back on when you are on a low income. Unlike council tax or utility bills, no one fines you if you don't spend on food and no one takes your children away, so that's what you cut, and you have a fag because that takes the hunger away.\" </p> <p>When you are on a low income you buy the kind of food that fills you up most cheaply. What may seem ignorant choices to others are in fact quite rational. Lobstein has calculated the cost of 100 calories of food energy from different types of food. The cheapest way to get your 100 calories is to buy fats, processed starches and sugars. A hundred calories of broccoli costs 51p, but 100 calories of frozen chips only cost 2p. Good-quality sausages that are high in meat but low in fat cost 22p per 100 calories, but \"value\" fatty ones are only 4p per 100 calories. Poor quality-fish fingers are 12p per 100 calories compared with 29p for ones made with fish fillet that are higher in nutrients. Fresh orange juice costs 38p per 100 calories, while the same dose of energy from sugary orange squash costs 5p. </p> <p>The FSA pointed out when it published its survey on the effect of low income on diet that middle-class people were eating increasingly high levels of junk, too. However, the same survey found that nearly a quarter of poor households skipped meals because they didn't have enough money. Nearly 40% worried that they would run out of food before more money came in. And yes, the working class smoke more and drink, as Oliver, falling over beer cans and fag ends outside a Rotherham house, notes. </p> <p>It has been unfashionable recently to talk in class terms, but there's nothing here that hasn't been raised for decades, centuries even, as both Lang and Lobstein point out. When George Orwell wrote The Road to Wigan Pier in the middle of the 1930s depression, he set out to record the lives of the English working class in the industrial north. He was appalled by the quality of their diets. \"A man dies and is buried and all his actions forgotten but the food he has eaten lives after him in the sound or rotten bones of his children.\" Orwell wrote down detailed accounts of how unemployed working-class people on welfare spent their money. He doubted it was even theoretically possible to live on their allowance. \"The basis of their diet is white bread and margarine, corned beef, sugared tea and potatoes. Would it not be better if they spent more money of wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread?\" Yes it would he answered, but \"no ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing. The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots ... A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita, an unemployed man doesn't ... When you are underfed, harassed, bored and miserable, you don't want to eat dull, wholesome food. You want something a little bit tasty. Let's have three pennorth of chips! Put the kettle on and we'll all have a nice cup of tea!\" </p> <p>To sit down to table to eat a family meal at leisure was always a luxury, according to food historian and consultant to the National Trust Sara Paston Williams. \"In the slums of industrial towns in the 19th century everyone including the children was out working, and if you were poor you didn't have an oven to cook, so you didn't get together for a family meal.\" The royal family were in part responsible for the creation of the myth of the ordinary family meal, with father Prince Albert, mother Queen Victoria and children sitting down together, although aristocratic children were, in fact, largely fed in the nursery. Mrs Beeton spread the idealised habit to the burgeoning middle classes, who were keen to copy the rich and differentiate themselves in their new wealth from the poor. The pre-industrial and rural experience of food was different. Food might be short in bad years but generally you had better access to a wider variety of foods, including some milk and vegetables in the country. Families working on the land broke off together to eat in the fields. But the Victorian urban poor lived on takeaways, hot pies from the pie man often full of horrible stuff, and adulterated white bread and adulterated marrow jam. </p> <p>To be hungry was deemed a natural state, and a necessary one since it goaded people who might otherwise be idle into working. James Vernon has traced changing attitudes to food and lack of it in Hunger: A Modern History. \"Two hundred years ago hunger was considered a spur to effort. Adam Smith and Thomas Malthus debated whether the emerging market economy would eradicate hunger or depended on it, but both agreed that the market should be left to produce plenty or want without intervention from the state. </p> <p>\"It was only in the second half of the 19th century that this view was first challenged, when hunger was discovered as a humanitarian issue, that reflected the failure of the state to protect its citizens from economic downtowns over which they had no control.\" </p> <p>The seminal work that changed attitudes was Friedrich Engels' The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1845. Drawing frequently on contemporary reports he read in the Manchester Guardian, he catalogued the misery of the poor quality, adulterated and inadequate diets of the poor. \"The habitual food of the individual working man varies according to his wages ... descending gradually ... until on the lowest round of the ladder potatoes form the sole food. As an accompaniment weak tea with perhaps a little sugar, milk or spirits is universally drunk ... such a way of living unavoidably engenders a multitude of diseases.\" </p> <p>Yet today the language of class has been almost removed from the political discourse. In Thatcherite and Blairite Britain, it has been framed instead in terms of \"choice\". There is talk of the need to give people opportunities, but after that, it's down to individual responsibility. It is no accident that the government's white paper on health and obesity was called \"Choosing health\" rather than the \"social determinants of health\". </p> <p>Roger Stone, Labour leader of Rotherham metropolitan borough council, is reluctant to put food and poverty in its class context, too. \"Jamie's programmes are not about us, it's not about the middle class, he's targeting people who are struggling,\" he told me. You mean the working class then? \"No, goodness, in this day and age, it's not class.\"</p> <p>You sense that Oliver used to think the same. Give people a chance, then it's up to them, and if, like some of the catering students in his previous programmes, they don't choose to take it, he's got no time for them. </p> <p>But here he's on a journey. The series is set in Rotherham because it was there that a group of mothers helped their children rebel against the new school menus imposed during Oliver's last series. Julie Critchlow took orders for chips and crisps and shoved them through the school railings at lunchtime, earning herself a place in tabloid mythology. \"Fat old scrubber\" was what Oliver called Critchlow back then. He may speak estuary but he is firmly positioned with the middle classes who almost exclusively buy his books and watch his cooking shows. But Critchlow has her revenge. As phlegmatic as a tricoteuse at the guillotine, she tells him firmly in this series that he \"lives in a bubble\", he has no idea what it's like for ordinary people on benefits. And she and her elderly mother, who did teach her to cook, want to get a pair of choppers on his head. Oliver symbolically submits: he puts his designer hair mess into the hands of Critchlow's hairdresser daughter. A little while later he is found complaining to his producer: \"Fuck. What's happened to my barnet?\" </p> <p>But it has done the trick, because now he talks differently. He's learned that you can't parachute in with change and waltz out again; tackling class inequality is a long, hard slog. This time he wants to get the whole town on board, to shift the tribe. He's not interested in training those who won't pass it on, who only want to cook for themselves as individuals. \"This is about the home, it's about family, it's about neighbours.\" With impeccable timing, as the global markets go into meltdown, Oliver discovers social capital and declares: \"They've got to own it. It's about ownership\".</p> <p>\u2022 Join the debate on food and class <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth\">theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth</a></p>",
  "<p>Your article (How turning into banks led to ruins, September 29) points out an important truth - mutual financial institutions have weathered the credit crunch storm far better than demutualised societies, which threw away their legacies for short-term monetary gain. These demutualised societies are now largely gone. As citizens and consumers we were sold the idea that mutual societies were quaint and something from the past - the future needed financial institutions that could operate globally and have access to international capital. How muddle-headed this all seems now. </p> <p>Today we need a new mutualism that brings financial and social benefits to members rather than remote turbo-capitalist institutions. Reclaiming mutuality as a viable concept is part of rebuilding a progressive consensus and trust in the financial system. In social housing, for example, this new mutualism is being built by the Commission on Co-operative and Mutual Housing, established by a range of socially concerned agencies, which seeks to forge a more mutual housing future and will be recommending how housing cooperatives might contribute to a more balanced national housing strategy that places coherent and active communities at the heart of policy.<br><strong>Kevin Gulliver</strong><br>Research and development director, Human City Institute </p> <p>Now that nationalisation is back in vogue (Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley), how about a few more obvious targets, like the railways and utilities? Can anyone seriously argue that consumers of gas and electricity are better off than when these basic resources were in public ownership? Some people made short-term gains on the shares, but we're all paying the price now. These companies employ armies of people to badger us into switching suppliers - a ridiculous waste of time and money. Bills have gone up faster than pre-privatisation, but the service is far worse. Railway privatisation set back the cause of environmental transport by at least 10 years, and while our European neighbours invest heavily in high-speed rail, we're stuck with a slow and overpriced system.</p> <p>New Labour is now distancing itself from the dodgy banking practices it once so admired. But I'd like to see a wholesale repudiation of the failed Anglo-Saxon economic model which has held sway since the 1980s, enthusiastically supported by this government. Alastair Darling tells us this is a global phenomenon, but it isn't.

  "<p>Britain's financial watchdog will unveil plans next week to raise protection for savers in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/banks\">banks and building societies</a> to \u00a350,000 as the government sought to reassure the public that it would do \"whatever is necessary\" to tackle the impact of the global <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crisis</a>.</p> <p>Amid signs yesterday of cross-party cooperation to prevent further runs on UK institutions, the Financial Services Authority is to begin urgent consultations with the City about raising the limit from the current \u00a335,000. The FSA will argue that \"at a time of market uncertainty it is important that deposits are properly protected. Raising the limit to \u00a350,000 would be designed to further reassure customers\".</p> <p>Ministers said yesterday that Treasury guarantees to depositors in Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley meant the government had already toughened up protection to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/savings\">savers</a> beyond the \u00a335,000 limit.</p> <p>Government sources said last night that the normal three-month consultation might be shortened in view of the unfolding financial crisis, particularly as the chancellor, Alistair Darling, had been urging the FSA to begin the process since June.</p> <p>Policymakers were yesterday given some breathing space from the crisis when dealers in the City held their nerve following the near-800 point drop in Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial average on Monday.</p> <p>The FTSE closed 1.7% higher - up 83.7 points at 4902.4 - while the Dow recouped more than half of Monday's fall in morning trading, amid hopes that Congress will agree to the White House's $700bn bail-out plan at the second time of asking later this week. Oil prices were up $4 a barrel and the US dollar also recovered following Monday's wipeout of shares. President Bush warned that the consequences would be \"painful and lasting\" if the deal was not passed.</p> <p>With the unwillingness of banks to lend to each other still causing immense stress in the global money markets, Gordon Brown gave full support to Bush. The prime minister held a breakfast meeting with the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, to discuss the crisis, and senior members of opposition parties were also involved in talks with ministers yesterday.</p> <p>Brown responded coolly to a call from Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, for a cast-iron guarantee that no depositor would lose out. The current \u00a335,000 ceiling covers 96% of deposits and an increase to \u00a350,000 would leave only 2% of accounts outside the scheme.</p> <p>The Irish government yesterday guaranteed all deposits at six of the country's key lending institutions, but Brown is wary of matching the move, fearing the government simply does not have the cash to back up such a pledge.</p> <p>The Irish step, widely seen to be in breach of EU competition law, has also angered the Conservatives, even though they kept their criticism private in an attempt to form a new bipartisan consensus to help stabilise the markets .</p> <p>In practice there appears no way to unstitch the Irish initiative even though it may attract depositors to take their savings to Dublin, denuding British banks of badly needed and mobile capital.</p> <p>Asked if he would follow the Irish example, Brown said in a round of interviews: \"Wherever there has been a problem we have taken action. Let us remember, the Irish are dealing with taxpayers' money. We have got to do what is right and also what is reasonable. Of course, we look at every intervention it is possible to take; but people can see from the actions we have taken so far that depositors have been protected, and no depositor has lost money.\"</p> <p>David Cameron yesterday ended his attacks on the Labour stewardship of the economy to offer the kind of bipartisan support which failed to emerge in the US, leading to the disastrous Congress vote against the $700bn US treasury bail-out. \"We cannot allow what happened in America to happen here,\" he said.</p> <p>Brown, enjoying a revival in the polls, stressed the decisive and quick action he had taken and added that he would rely on the initiative and resourcefulness of the British people to see the country through the crisis.</p> <p>Darling said: \"I already have taken the powers I need, and I have made it clear, through Northern Rock and this weekend with Bradford &amp; Bingley, that I will do whatever is necessary.\"</p> <p>Anthony Grech, a market strategist at IG Index, said it may not take much for market sentiment to turn negative again: \"Expectations are that this bail-out will get rubber-stamped sooner rather than later - but recent events have done nothing for market sentiment, so at the moment it would be somewhat over-optimistic to expect that this rescue plan will be the answer to all of the current problems.\"</p> <p>In the City, the gap between the official bank rate and three-month sterling interbank rate - the level at which banks lend money to each other - continued to widen, adding to upward pressure on borrowing costs for mortgage payers and businesses.</p> <p>The White House, the treasury secretary Henry Paulson, congressional leaders and presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama maintained pressure on Congress to pass the bail-out bill by the end of the week. Last night the Senate agreed to vote on the bail-out bill later today ahead of the House of Representatives revoting on the issue.</p> <p>\"There's an overarching belief that at some point this week, whether it's Wednesday or Thursday, we'll get something passed by the House,\" said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &amp; Co in Boston. Without the bail-out plan, which would allow the US treasury to buy toxic mortgage-related assets from banks, credit markets could remain frozen and lead to a recession.</p> <p>\"I assure our citizens and citizens around the world that this is not the end of the legislative process,\" Bush said.</p>",
  "<p>Dairy Crest, the maker of Cathedral City cheese, Country Life butter and Clover spread, warned yesterday it was planning job cuts and considering closing a UK factory in the face of higher costs and an increasingly gloomy economic outlook.</p> <p>The company said its key brands had performed well over the past six months with double-digit sales growth, but it was facing higher costs for milk, vegetable oils, packaging energy and fuel.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Mark Allen, said: \"The commercial environment has become more challenging over recent months and we are taking action, including significant cost reductions, to ensure our business and our brands are well positioned for the months ahead.\"</p> <p>Dairy Crest's cost-cutting includes reorganising its head office, which will mean job losses, and other support functions which it said would deliver \"significant cost savings\" next year.</p> <p>It added it was considering the closure of its Nottingham dairy, part of its Express Dairies acquisition in 2006. The plant processes some 90 million litres of milk every year and employs 215 people. Dairy Crest said it had started a 90-day consultation with employees and unions and, if the closure did go ahead, it would mean an \u00a38m exceptional charge, including asset write-downs.</p> <p>Dairy Crest said its foods division had seen a \"significant uplift\" in the first half, with Clover recovering well, double-digit growth as well from Utterly Butterly and a promising start for Clover Lighter, which was launched in August.</p> <p>Today the company is launching a \u00a35m advertising campaign for its Country Life brand, which will feature the Sex Pistols front man John Lydon in his first television adverts.</p> <p>Dairy Crest said the Country Life brand had a strong start to the year, with an exceptional performance from Country Life Spreadable, and continued to be optimistic about its prospects.</p> <p>Cathedral City cheese also turned in a strong performance.</p> <p>On dairies, Dairy Crest said it expected the division's performance to be \"well down on the first half last year\".</p> <p>The retail milk business was progressing with long-term deals at supermarket groups Sainsbury's and Morrisons and with more business from Lidl.</p> <p>This year Dairy Crest increased the price for milk delivered to customers' doorsteps and acknowledged that it had seen some effect on volume. </p> <p>It said UK milk production levels remained tight, with farmers facing further rises in on-farm costs.</p> <p>Panmure analyst Andrew Saunders said he was sticking to his forecast of full-year profit of \u00a3102m for Dairy Crest. </p> <p>\"These [cost-cutting] measures should be capable of mitigating inflationary pressures and help underpin group margins,\" he said.</p> <p>Royal Bank of Scotland analysts are also maintaining their full-year forecast of \u00a3101.5m. \"We retain our buy recommendation , though we recognise that the market may well need reassurance on how [the second half] is panning out before the shares are re-rated.\"</p> <p>Last night Dairy Crest shares closed down 6.75p at 400p.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Human Rights</strong></p> <p>Cherie Booth was heckled yesterday when she defended the Human Rights Act at a fringe meeting. </p> <p>She was given a generally polite reception by the audience. But they expressed their disapproval loudly after she clashed with Chris Grayling, the shadow work and pensions secretary, over the HRA. They were on the panel at a fringe meeting organised by the Sun on \"fixing broken Britain\". </p> <p>\"We need to tear it up and start again,\" Grayling said. Blair said he was being \"specious\". As she tried to say that the HRA was there to protect fundamental rights such as the right to life, some activists heckled her but she went on to defend the act. \"We should be proud that in our country we do not have an elected dictatorship, and that the courts are there to protect individual rights. And, yes, that does apply to the most unpopular people, whether they are criminals, whether they are Gypsies, whether they are illegal asylum seekers, because in the end we are a decent society and we believe that everybody is entitled to respect and that has to be policed on our behalf.\" </p> <p><strong>Development</strong></p> <p>A Conservative government would set up a \u00a340m a year fund to help innovative charities and campaign groups step up the fight against global poverty, the shadow international development secretary, Andrew Mitchell, will announce today.</p> <p>In a move designed to illustrate the opposition's commitment to development, Mitchell will say that some of the money spent by the government in fast-growing countries such as China should be reallocated to seedcorn investment in projects struggling for cash. The fund would reward entrepreneurs devising novel ways of reaching the poor.</p> <p>\"We will invite British non-governmental organisations [NGOs] and charities to take the lead,\" Mitchell will say. \"They will come to us with plans to reduce poverty. The money will go to those proposals which are effective, accountable and focused towards clear, measurable outcomes.\"</p> <p>The Department for International Development currently funds a range of NGOs from its \u00a35.6bn budget, but Mitchell believes that the system is too bureaucratic and demand for government support exceeds supply. </p> <p>To balance risk in the portfolio, the so-called Poverty Impact Fund would also support well-established projects with a proven track record of reducing poverty. </p> <p><strong>Sharia courts</strong></p> <p>The Conservatives accused the government yesterday of being \"silent\" on sharia courts, which they said must be given no authority over criminal and family law matters in Britain.</p> <p>Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, made the criticism as he warned that the government had neglected the threat of radicalisation. \"For all its tough talk on terrorism, the government is dropping the ball on security and radicalisation,\" Grieve said. \"Lax on fanatical preachers. Silent on sharia courts ... Sharia courts can be given no authority over criminal and family law.\"</p> <p>But Grieve, who told the Guardian last week that multiculturalism had downplayed the identity of \"long-term inhabitants and failed to provide a coherent identity for second and third-generation immigrants\", believes that sharia courts can have a role. He likens them to the Jewish Beth Din - acceptable because their rulings do not conflict with English law.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron will today confront Gordon Brown's jibe that he is a novice unfit to become prime minister, when he declares that \"character and judgment\" are more important than experience.</p> <p>In his keynote speech to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">Conservative conference</a>, Cameron will attempt to demonstrate his mettle when he serves notice on his party that it should brace itself for a bruising start to government, which could even lead to tax rises.</p> <p>Cameron embarked on a major rewrite of his speech in the wake of the deepening global financial crisis. He also made an unscheduled speech yesterday offering the government bipartisan support.</p> <p>But the Tory leader will make it clear today that his bipartisan approach on the economy will not stop him challenging the prime minister when he hits backs at Brown's \"novice\" quip. Cameron will throw back at him what Brown regards as his own great strength - a decade of running the economy. \"To do difficult things for the long term, or even to get us through the financial crisis in the short term, it's not experience we need, it's character and judgment. To rebuild our economy, it's not more of the same we need, but change.\"</p> <p>Cameron will then depict Brown as a conservative as he accuses him in all but name of repeating John Major's mistake in 1997 of dismissing Tony Blair on the grounds that he had never held office. \"Experience is the argument of the incumbent over the ages,\" he will say. \"Experience is what they always say when they try to block change.\"</p> <p>Unlike last year, when Cameron walked around the stage and spoke without notes, the Tory leader will instead stand behind a lectern.</p> <p>In a speech shorn of jokes, a dour Cameron will make clear the Tory aspiration of an overall cut in taxes may have to wait a long time - and may even be replaced by tax rises. \"We will need to do difficult and unpopular things for the long term of the country,\" Cameron will say.</p> <p>Senior Tories acknowledge that the financial crisis presents them with a big challenge, because Brown may well be boosted as he presents himself as a serious and experienced figure best placed to deal with a global problem. But they believe that their formula for the economy - to ensure that public spending grows below the trend rate of economic growth over an economic cycle - is the correct approach in an uncertain period. But the aspiration - to use money saved by the new formula for eventual tax cuts - will have to be put on hold, because a Tory government would have to concentrate on paying off government borrowing and paying for increased welfare bills.</p> <p>Cameron will today describe his bipartisan approach as the best way of dealing with the crisis. \"We must set aside our differences and work together with the government in the short term to ensure stability. But that must not stop us telling the truth about the mistakes that have been made.\"</p> <p>Brown, enjoying a resurgence in his reputation as the man for a crisis, yesterday responded coolly to an offer of bipartisan support to rush through banking legislation to ease the crisis, as he rejected Tory proposals to suspend accountancy rules said to be acting as a downward death spiral on the value of assets.</p> <p>Cameron spoke to Brown late on Monday night to offer his party's support to push through a banking reform bill due to start its parliamentary proceedings on Monday. He said his party was dropping objections to aspects of the bill, and put forward new proposals to protect depositors.</p> <p>George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, yesterday rushed to a meeting with chancellor Alistair Darling in London. Both sides tried to adopt a spirit of inter-party unity in the face of the crisis, while retaining their distinctive policy positions.</p> <p>Cameron explained his bipartisan approach by saying: \"There well may need to be a marshalling of public support behind some big decisions.\"</p> <p>His remarks refer to fears that the HBOS-Lloyds deal may be renegotiated, because of the fall in HBOS shares, or that a bigger general bail-out may be required. Cameron warned that he was not offering a \"blank cheque\". At one point the Tories considered cancelling the conference in the face of the collapse in Wall Street.</p> <p>In a three-point package Cameron proposed extending protection for savers so that deposits up to \u00a350,000 at a failed bank, instead of the current \u00a335,000, are guaranteed by the state; a new power for a Bank of England-led reconstruction of failing banks as a way of protecting taxpayers' money; and a three-month suspension of \"mark to market\" rules that force banks to value all their assets at the price they would fetch if they sold them that day.</p>",
  "<p>Your article on recent allegations of army bullying at Catterick garrison reports that a member of the defence select committee has called for investigations to be conducted by \"an independent body with teeth, away from the chain of command\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/19/military.bbcdocumentary\">Corporals suspended over bullying claims</a>, September 19). This would be wrong.</p> <p>An independent body is not the best investigative tool where abuses in the military are concerned. Any examination of practices within the army must be undertaken, at least in part, by those who understand army practices.</p> <p>I was at one time an infantry recruit in the British army. In 1980, callow and fresh out of grammar school, I wanted to become a \"squaddie\". My background - rare among recruits of that era - meant I came in for some fearful abuse from my training corporals. They made my life hell. And that was part of their job.</p> <p>They realised that if I left training and went to my regiment with my grammar-school mores and methods still intact then I would not have lasted five minutes. They had to make me change - in essence, conform - while I was still in their \"care\". It was better by far that the corrective bullying be done by those training corporals rather than by others once in the regiment. I thank them for not having a \"zero tolerance of bullying\".</p> <p>The army needs soldiers who can hack it when the chips are down and who can put up with any amount of pain, discomfort, provocation and stress when they arrive in the Iraqs and Afghanistans of this world. Any recruit who cannot take \"instances of abuse\" in training should not be in the army. And those who cannot take the abuse will leave while still in training. Both the individual and the army are then better off.</p> <p>The army owes all its personnel a duty of care. No soldier, such as the anti-bullying campaigner Lynn Farr's son, should die in the manner in which he did. Nor should any soldier be \"punched, kicked, shaken, throttled ... urinated on [or] repeatedly hit\". But there is one place where the use of violence is acceptable. This is on military firing ranges, probably the most dangerous working environment anywhere. Mistakes are not infrequent even when trained soldiers are involved; but when recruits are let loose the danger is increased tenfold. It is simply not enough for any training corporal to verbally chastise a recruit who has come close to killing those around him by slack weapon-handling. Such chastisements often have little effect. </p> <p>Violence, in the form of single punch or kick, is a \"short, sharp shock\" perceived by many to be the only suitable remedial action. I am glad we still have training corporals who are prepared to put their own careers at risk by employing necessary measures that most would balk at.</p> <p>We would all like to live in a world where people are free from verbal and physical abuse at their place of work. But the army is not a high street bank or a burger bar. There has to be scope for different standards to apply.</p> <p>\u2022 Rod Thornton is a lecturer at the University of Nottingham's school of politics and international relations, and was formerly an infantry sergeant <a href=\"mailto:irt624@yahoo.co.uk\">irt624@yahoo.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>What are we to make of the Congressional rejection of the Paulson proposal? The politics is simple: elections are a rare moment of accountability in our political process, and all 435 members of the House of Representatives are up for re-election in a matter of weeks. The Bush administration has lost the confidence of the American people, and so has Wall Street. </p> <p>Those who created the problem are now the doctors offering the prescriptions. A little while ago we were told everything was fine. Then, less than six months ago, we were told that the economy was on the mend. Now we are told the patient needs a massive transfusion; but everyone can see that the patient is suffering from internal bleeding - in California, the number of foreclosures may already be outpacing voluntary sales. Yet nothing is being done to stem the haemorrhaging. </p> <p>While the president says the economy faces the risk of economic meltdown, he threatens to veto a stimulus package that would create jobs - and he seems particularly adamant about a stimulus package that includes improved unemployment benefits. Traditionally, this is done when there is a threat of an economic downturn; if the downturn doesn't materialise, it doesn't cost anything. And while the administration and Wall Street promise this is just a temporary loan, not a bail-out, there was strong opposition to making the financial industry pay for any losses. Why would that be, if they are so sure that there won't be losses?</p> <p>The rescue bill left enormous discretion to an administration on the wane, an administration that has shown unparalleled incompetence, an administration which even tried to politicise the attorney general's office. Americans worry that there will be political favourites among the recipients of the hundreds of billions of dollars. That treasury secretary Hank Paulson seemed tough on Lehman but reversed course when his old firm Goldman Sachs was at risk is hardly reassuring. </p> <p>If the administration really thought the problems were as severe as claimed, shouldn't they have put forward a bill that was less outrageous? Did they really think that Americans would swallow giving them authority to spend $700bn, without oversight or judicial review, in a bill of a few pages? Normally, if you think there is a crisis, you try to forge a compromise with those who see the world differently - workers who worry about the loss of jobs, and homeowners who worry about the risk of foreclosure. </p> <p>Americans have lost faith not only in the administration, but in its economic philosophy: a new corporate welfarism masquerading behind free-market ideology; another version of trickle-down economics, where the hundreds of billions to Wall Street that caused the problem were supposed to somehow trickle down to help ordinary Americans. Trickle-down hasn't been working well in America over the past eight years. </p> <p>The very assumption that the rescue plan has to help is suspect. After all, the IMF and US treasury bail-outs for Wall Street 10 years ago in Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia and Argentina didn't work for those countries, although it did enable Wall Street to get back most of its money. The taxpayers in these other poor countries picked up the tab for the financial markets' mistakes. This time, it is American taxpayers who are being asked to pick up the tab. And that's the difference. For all the rhetoric about democracy and good governance, the citizens in those countries didn't really get a chance to vote on the bail-outs. Had they, most would have suffered the same fortune as Paulson's.</p> <p>There is, in fact, a widespread consensus among economists about what should be done. The economy is weak, and would remain so even with a good rescue plan. That is why there is a need for a strong stimulus. The February stimulus package was badly designed, and its anaemic effects offset by soaring oil and food prices. Given the enormous increase in the deficit during the past seven years (from $5.7bn to over $9 trillion - and that doesn't include the bills yet to be paid for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars) we have to be sure that we get the biggest bang for the buck. We need increased unemployment benefits, and aid to states and localities, which otherwise will be forced to cut back on spending, depressing the economy further. We need more investment in both the public and private sectors. </p> <p>The fundamental problem with the financial system is that there have been large losses. Loans were made to people who couldn't repay. They were made on the basis of collateral whose value was inflated by a bubble. That bubble has burst, and the collateral is now worth less than the loan. The experts believe real estate prices have still a way to fall. This is not a matter of market confidence. This is a matter of market reality. Paulson would have us believe otherwise, but the American people know better. The fact that he and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke don't seem to grasp these realities undermines confidence that they know what they are doing. </p> <p>In environmental economics, there is a basic concept called the polluter pays principle. It is a matter of fairness, but also of efficiency. Wall Street has polluted our economy with toxic mortgages. It should now pay for the cleanup.</p> <p>What is so sad about this whole debacle is that it was predictable. Predicatable and avoidable. Perhaps Paulson and the administration believed that they could bamboozle Americans into doing whatever they asked. But Americans had been bamboozled before - into signing a blank cheque for the Iraq war. </p> <p>A sad day for Wall Street, but it may be a glorious day for democracy. Hopefully Congress will now devise a plan that is not based on trickle-down economics. A plan that identifies the real sources of the problem and does something about them - a real stimulus to the economy, a real programme to stem the flood of foreclosures, and a transparent programme for filling the holes in bank balance sheets. A plan that assures US taxpayers the costs will be borne by those who created the problem. Accountability means paying for the full consequences for one's actions - and the financial system has much to account for.</p> <p>\u2022 Joseph E Stiglitz is university professor at Columbia University and recipient of the Nobel prize in 2001.

  "<p>From an elderly patient laughing as he receives dialysis treatment to the eggs with cosies representing the nurturing of human embryos, this is the health service as it is rarely seen. The striking and often playful images are by photographer Gina Glover, who has just completed a one-year residency at Guy's and St Thomas' hospital assisted conception unit in south London. The resulting work is now on permanent display at the unit - and tomorrow she will be awarded a Royal Photographic Society's medal for photography advances in public service.</p> <p>Glover, a director and co-founder of the London-based social documentary photography library Photofusion, specialises in hospital-based projects. She trained in fine art, but got into photography as a young mother in the early 1980s when she took pictures of her local hospital as part of a community campaign against closure. She has since worked at some 15 hospitals across the country, and her next photography project is at North Middlesex hospital, north London.</p> <p>The challenge of making the medical environment and processes accessible is what motivates Glover, and she spends time observing scientific procedures and talking to scientists, medics and patients. It is through those conversations that Glover develops an understanding of their work, which helps her to come up with ideas for her pieces. </p> <p>\"My camera is my last tool,\" she explains. \"I spend a lot of time building relationships either with the medical professionals or the patients, developing trust and having conversations.\" </p> <p>For example, she captured the image of the dialysis patient at Northwick Park and St Mark's hospitals, west London, when she joked with him that he was the only patient without one of her portrait photographs on the walls of the room. </p> <p>Being a photographer in residence, she adds, means involving patients in her work, which in turn helps make them feel more valued. \"I never know what image I will make,\" she admits. \"It's a process of letting go and allowing the subject to speak for itself.\"</p> <p>Glover, 45, from south London, believes art practice in hospital is vital because a more pleasant environment means people feel more comfortable. The health secretary, Alan Johnson, said last month that art has a key role in healthcare and that \"its therapeutic value cannot be underestimated\". Glover adds: \"If people see an image in a hospital and that sparks an interest, and they follow it up with, for example, a visit to a museum, that's great.\" </p> <p>One of the challenges, she explains, is making sure that complex and highly emotive areas of practice, such as assisted reproduction, are portrayed accurately and sensitively. \"Medical science and art are both inventive, but in very different ways,\" she says. \"Put them together, and they can cross-fertilise and inspire each other.\"</p>",
  "<p>Vinton Gray \"Vint\" Cerf is a very distinguished, kindly, silver-haired gentleman in a three-piece suit, so perhaps I shouldn't expect him to ride to our rescue with six guns blazing, but I'd settle for a small pearl-handled silver pistol. I want to know who is going to clean up the internet now that it's full of scammers, spammers and criminals running zombie networks, while its connecting pipes are clogged up with porn-to-porn file swapping.</p> <p>Sadly, Cerf doesn't have a silver bullet, either. \"It's every man for himself,\" he says, grinning. \"In the end, it seems every machine has to defend itself. The internet was designed that way.\"</p> <p><strong>Aiming high</strong></p> <p>And he should know. In the early 1970s, Cerf co-designed the TCP/IP protocol suite on which internet communications are based, and was founding president of the Internet Society.</p> <p>He led the team that engineered the first email service to run over the internet; he chaired Icann, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers; and he has been working with Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the Interplanetary Internet (<a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/vint2\">bit.ly/vint2</a>). It may be a case of \"tomorrow, the stars\", but the here-and-now can seem a bit of a mess.</p> <p>Cerf points out that \"like every medium, the internet can be abused. When we think about it, we can commit fraud locally and internationally using the telephone system and postal service. We can perpetrate a variety of crimes, and in every instance where we have had a technology like that, ultimately society has said: 'There are certain constraints, certain behaviours we will consider to be antisocial. We may not be able to prevent this happening, but we will choose to have consequences if we catch you.' </p> <p>\"This question comes up annually at the internet governance meetings. So I won't be surprised if there are national and international agreements reached about certain unacceptable behaviours on the net, and they will be enforced to one degree or another.\"</p> <p>However, Cerf is also convinced that it's the internet's openness - in allowing people with new ideas to do their thing without getting anyone's permission - that is the main source of its power.</p> <p>\"So I have this almost schizoid hope that we deal with some of the abuses in the net and, at the same time, we don't lose this very open environment, so that information-sharing remains as open as it has been,\" he says.</p> <p>One example is Google, a company that Cerf - now 65 - joined three years ago as Chief Internet Evangelist. \"Google wouldn't exist if Larry [Page] and Sergey [Brin] hadn't just built this thing and tried it out. The same is true with Jerry [Yang, co-founder] at Yahoo,\" says Cerf.</p> <p>The internet hardly needs an evangelist now. However, it still needs defending, and Cerf has been putting the case for \"net neutrality\" - a hot topic for US politicians, who are being lobbied by the phone companies. </p> <p>\"We're expecting new legislation,\" he says. \"I think there should be very strong measures to prevent anti-competitive actions, so I'm actually very sanguine about the passing of legislation in the United States.\"</p> <p><strong>Traffic cops</strong></p> <p>He says Google's aim is to ensure open communications, which means equally open to different technologies and different types of traffic. However, limiting the amount of traffic each person uses is a different matter. \"As long as you get the capacity you're paying for, that's a form of fairness,\" says Cerf. \"It's orthogonal to net neutrality.\"</p> <p>As the publicly recognised \"father of the internet\" and winner of a Turing and other awards, Cerf also opens doors for Google. Last Wednesday he spent the morning talking at the British Computer Society before visiting the Guardian for a Q&amp;A with a couple of dozen staff over a sandwich lunch. He started out by showing us his dancing programmable Sony MP3 player, Rolly, which shows we can now put computer power wherever we need it, he says. It's really an ice-breaker to show he's not stuffy.</p> <p>Suffice it to say that Cerf doesn't think the net will be brought to its knees either by botnets or spam. \"Spam is a problem, but we can filter it,\" he says, and its demands on capacity are \"small relative to the bits carrying images and video\". As for the zombies, he points out that \"the botnet herders don't want to destroy the internet: they need it to make a living. We may not think it's acceptable, but that's their motivation.\"</p> <p>He also doesn't think the net is going to exhibit any form of consciousness. \"I don't believe we will see grow out of the network the kind of intelligence that sounds like a Fred Hoyle science fiction novel,\" he says. However, \"even if the internet is not intelligent and aware, it will feel more intelligent than it does today. But it's fair to say that if you want the system to do things you care about, you have to let it know what you care about. You have to give up some information voluntarily.\"</p> <p><strong>House of cards</strong></p> <p>Afterwards, over a coffee, I raise the spectre of the \"two-tier internet\" that some companies would like. There could be, for example, a trusted, controlled \"overnet\" for commercial and business use, and an \"undernet\" where anything goes. </p> <p>\"It's probably not wise to design systems that assume that a particular subset is trusted,\" says Cerf. \"I don't mean to say you shouldn't try, but every machine that can be compromised is a potential hazard. A machine that was OK yesterday is certainly not OK today: it may have ingested an infected memory stick. At the very least, you have to keep validating it. My bias right now tends to be 'It's every man for himself' - you need to be suspicious whether you're inside the trusted cloud or not, and when it fails, the house of cards tends to collapse.\"</p> <p>But the continuous validation of known sources is not something for which the internet provides much help. \"The idea of a virtual private network was not part of the original design,\" says Cerf, with a grin. \"It was actually an oversight. It didn't occur to me that it would be useful until afterwards.\"</p> <p>Of course, no one foresaw just how big, or how pervasive, the internet was going to become. In the end, we should probably be grateful the designers opted not for control but for freedom.</p> <h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 65</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Graduated Stanford University, 1965, BS in Mathematics; MS in Computer Science, UCLA; PhD in Computer Science, UCLA</p> <p><strong>Career</strong></p> <p><strong>Includes</strong> assistant professor, Stanford University; US Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); vice-president, MCI; founding president of the Internet Society; visiting scientist, Nasa; chairman, ICANN; chief internet evangelist, Google</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married to Sigrid; two sons</p>",

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday November 28 2008</strong></p> <p>In the article below, we describe the geophysicist Professor Syun-Ichi Akasofu as a founding director of the Heartland Institute. In fact he has never held any formal position with the US thinktank.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Republican <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> and her officials in the Alaskan state government drew on the work of at least six scientists known to be sceptical about the dangers and causes of global warming, to back efforts to stop polar bears being protected as an endangered species, the Guardian can disclose. Some of the scientists were funded by the oil industry. </p> <p>In official submissions to the US government's consultation on the status of the polar bear, Palin and her team referred to at least six scientists who have questioned either the existence of warming as a largely man-made phenomenon or its severity. One paper was partly funded by the US oil company ExxonMobil.</p> <p>The status of the polar bear has become a battleground in the debate on global warming. In May the US department of the interior rejected Palin's objections and listed the bear as a threatened species, saying that two-thirds of the world's polar bears were likely to be extinct by 2050 due to the rapid melting of the sea ice. Palin, governor of Alaska and the Republican nominee for US vice-president, responded last month by suing the federal government, to try to overturn the ruling. The case will be heard in January.</p> <p>Though the state of Alaska has no polar bear specialists on its staff, the governor's stance has pitted it against the combined scientific fire-power of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Geological Survey, and world experts on the mammal.</p> <p>In its lawsuit, Alaska said it opposed the endangered label partly because the listing would \"deter activities such as ... oil and gas exploration and development\". Oil companies recently bid $2.7bn (\u00a31.5bn) for rights to explore the Chuckchi sea, an established polar bear habitat.</p> <p>The threatened species status might also impede the building of an Alaskan natural gas pipeline, which Palin has called the \"will of God\". In a letter last year to the US interior secretary, Dirk Kempthorne, she said she believed the polar bear population was \"abundant, stable and unthreatened by direct human activity\". She opposed the call for the listing because it \"did not use the best available scientific and commercial information\".</p> <p>Her own Alaskan review of the science drew on a joint paper by seven authors, four of whom were well-known climate- change contrarians. Her paper argued that it was \"certainly premature, if not impossible\" to link temperature rise in Alaska with human CO2 emissions.</p> <p>The paper, entitled Polar Bears of Western Hudson Bay and Climate Change, has been criticised for relying on old research and ignoring evidence that Arctic sea-ice is melting at a quickening pace. Walt Meier, a world authority on sea ice, based at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, said: \"The paper doesn't measure up scientifically.\"</p> <p>One co-author of the paper, Willie Soon, completed the study with funding from ExxonMobil - which has oil operations in Alaska's North Slope - as well as from the American Petroleum Institute. Soon was a former senior scientist with the George C Marshall Institute, which acts as an incubator for climate-change scepticism. The institute has received $715,000 in funding from ExxonMobil since 1998. </p> <p>In May, ExxonMobil announced that it was no longer funding Marshall and other groups linked with contrarian views. It said this was to avoid \"distraction from the need to provide energy while reducing greenhouse gas emissions\" and stressed that the company did not \"control the research itself\".</p> <p>Another co-author of the document was Sallie Baliunas. In 2003 she and Soon were criticised when it was revealed that a joint paper had been partially funded by the American Petroleum Institute. Thirteen scientists whom they cited issued a rebuttal and several editors of the journal Climate Research resigned because of the \"flawed peer review\". A third co-author of the polar bear study, David Legates, a professor at Delaware University, is also associated with the Marshall Institute.</p> <p>The citation by Palin and her officials prompted complaints from Congress. One member, Brad Miller, dubbed the polar bear study phony science. </p> <p>Palin told Miller: \"Attempts to discredit scientists ... simply because their analyses do not agree with your views, would be a disservice to this country.\" Miller now says that Palin's use of the paper shows she differs greatly from John McCain, the Republican presidential contender, who has pressed for scientific integrity. \"Turning to the cottage industry of scientists who are funded because they spread doubt about global warming is not integrity,\" Miller said.</p> <p>Palin's submission consulted J Scott Armstrong, a specialist in forecasting, who regards the global warming issue as \"public hysteria\". </p> <p>Two other contrarian scholars were cited. One was Syun-Ichi Akasofu, formerly director of the International Arctic Research Centre, in Alaska, who argues that climate change could be a hangover from the little ice age. He is a founding director of the Heartland Institute, a thinktank that has received $676,500 from ExxonMobil since 1998. </p> <p>Timothy Ball, a retired professor from Winnipeg, is cited for his climate and polar bear research. He has called human-made global warming \"the greatest deception in the history of science\". He has worked with both Friends of Science, and the Natural Resources Stewardship Project, which each had funding from energy firms. </p> <p>Kert Davies, research director at Greenpeace US, said the state of Alaska under Palin's leadership had relied on scholars who argue the opposite view to that of the overwhelming consensus in the scientific community. \"It shows that she is completely out of touch with the urgency of the climate crisis.\"</p> <p>Last month Palin agreed that the Alaskan climate was changing but added: \"I'm not one though who would attribute it to being man-made.\" She later tried to retract the statement.</p>",
  "<p>If a week is a long time in politics, then a day is a long time in finance. Business news used to be dry, but that's all changed. Reading the financial headlines now feels like an armchair rollercoaster - not so much green shoots as green faces. <br><br>The Conservative party must have very mixed feelings. Bad news for the economy is worse news for the prime minister; 11 years in Downing Street, 10 of them in the Treasury, means he's squarely in the frame. Not flush, just Gordon. </p> <p>But the headlines \u2013 from the FT's \"<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/17ce4468-8f22-11dd-946c-0000779fd18c.html?nclick_check=1\">Banking's crisis of confidence deepens</a>\" to the Guardian's \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2008/oct/01/manufacturing.manufacturingdata\">UK manufacturing sector shrinks at fastest rate in 17 years</a>\" \u2013 have threatened to push their conference off the front pages. </p> <p>And the nature of the crisis has exposed the twin Tory weaknesses: bad experience in the past, and inexperience today. </p> <p>It was, after all, Conservative government deregulation of financial services that opened the era of easy credit and led to first boom, then bust, in the mortgage market, back in the days when David Cameron was Norman Lamont's bag carrier. While commentators turn to the Lib Dems' Treasury spokesman, Vincent Cable, for advice, <a href=\"http://sarabedford.com/blog/2008/09/do-you-know-as-much-about-economics-as-vince-cable-george/\">the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, is left floundering </a>.</p> <p>On Monday night, we were canvassing residents in one of the tower blocks in Finsbury, on Islington's border with the Square Mile. The brightly-lit office blocks of the city looked within touching distance, but could be a million miles away. We were talking about pensions, post offices, mental health care. Bailing out bankers is not these constituents' top priority. </p> <p>The Lib Dem prescription - cutting taxes for people on low and middle incomes, providing more affordable housing, making the energy companies reinvest in tackling fuel poverty, and helping people in debt - strikes far more of a chord on the doorsteps. We think the government should help savers before speculators, hence <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/home/clegg-government-must-guarantee-all-bank-deposits-to-protect-british-savers-11713303;show \">Nick Clegg's call for depositor protection legislation</a> - but once again the government seems to have got its priorities wrong. </p> <p>Cable was one of the first to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/sep/29/bradfordbingley.creditcrunch\">warn against converting building societies into banks</a>, the demutualisation that junked an essentially prudent tradition for wild speculation (something of a parable for New Labour). In Islington at least, that spirit of mutuality lives on. Our <a href=\"http://www.iccu.coop\">local credit union </a> is now open to all Islington borough residents \u2013 and those in the City too.</p> <p>If a day is a long time in finance, then a decade is a short time in regeneration. Last week I was part of the group unveiling a <a href=\"http://www.waterscape.com/features-and-articles/news/1080/full-public-access-a-step-closer-for-city-road-basin\">new public open space at City Road Basin</a>. Part of the waterside that for generations has been a shabby and inaccessible area behind industrial blocks is now a new piazza, where people can now enjoy the amazing views the length of the basin. This expanse of water is Islington's second largest public open space, now truly open for our community to enjoy. </p> <p>This hasn't happened by accident, but as part of the \"planning gain\" from a new development; a mix of offices, flats and affordable homes, it's been at least six years in the planning. And the local council has secured the open space before much of the <a href=\"http://www.angelwaterside.com/index2.html\">private development</a> which is paying for it has been started - quite an achievement. The award-winning architect <a href=\"http://www.bennettsassociates.com/\">Rab Bennetts </a> told us that other regeneration schemes he's championed have taken a decade or more; so on that basis, City Road Basin is steaming ahead. </p> <p>A bizarre postscript to Ruth Kelly's departure as transport secretary is the Tory U-turn on Heathrow. Labour MPs seem proudest when voting with the Lib Dems \u2013 on issues from nuclear power to 42 days. And now the Conservatives too are <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/policies/liberal-democrats-approve-radical-transport-reforms-551593;show\">following our lead</a>, rejecting Heathrow expansion in favour of high-speed rail.</p> <p>For years Liberal Democrats have argued that expanding Heathrow is wrong, when fighting climate change must be a priority. An expanded Heathrow will be the equivalent of building another airport the size of Gatwick, producing the same amount of CO2 emissions as Kenya. BAA's plans would see a whole community flattened, with all the arrogance of an 18th lord moving the village to improve his view. And in the current economic climate \u2013 with fuel costs rising, airlines folding and the business market contracting \u2013 it's a bad investment too. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Boris' <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4794832.ece\">barmy idea</a> of an island airport would be entertaining, were he not the mayor of London. Is this the real Boris emerging: the first cuckoo of autumn?</p>",
  "<p><strong>John Scales</strong> Former Tottenham and England defender</p> <p><strong>Yes</strong></p> <p>There is a deepening crisis at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/tottenhamhotspur\">Tottenham</a> and if they carry on losing it will only get worse. I don't want to stick the knife in or say that it is time to get rid of Juande Ramos but it doesn't take a genius to see that there are some major problems. </p> <p>Ramos will point out that he has had to let go of Dimitar Berbatov and Robbie Keane and when you let those sort of players go you will have major problems. But they have also spent a lot of money. Bringing in Roman Pavyluchenko was a risk because clearly he is going to need time to adapt to the Premier League and other big signings have also disappointed. Have they spent the money wisely? Only Ramos and the board of directors can answer that but so far it doesn't look like they have.</p> <p>The last thing they needed was a poor start to the season and they are paying the price for being disorganised over the summer. Before you know it the players are completely deflated and the worsening situation just shows you how quickly things can snowball. There are still some great players at Tottenham but they look like they are playing with absolutely no confidence at the minute.</p> <p>Now it is down to Ramos to turn things around and it will be a massive test for him. His track record in Spain was excellent but he is still very much untried in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a> and he is clearly struggling to get that group to play as he wants them to. You can get a great manager with a group of lesser quality players who can raise their game and a poor manager with great players who can struggle to build a team. No player will blame the manager if he plays poorly but if a manager hasn't got it right the team's performance will be reflected in that. I really do hope that he can turn it around because otherwise they are going to be major decisions about his future.</p> <p>Tottenham are suffering a hangover from the past 12 months. Martin Jol took the club to top-five finishes but those weren't seen as good enough so the board went out and found a guy who they felt could take the club into the Champions League. That hasn't happened. They won the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/carlingcup0708\">Carling Cup</a> but otherwise you would have to say it has been a pretty poor first year since Ramos took over. In hindsight, Jol looks to have been better equipped to take the club forward.</p> <p>I doubt very much whether the board of directors will carry the can. If a manager at any club continues not to get results then they will be the one to go. If things don't improve soon the board will have to hold their hands up and say: \"This isn't working for whatever reason, we got it wrong and we have to make some changes.\"</p> <p><strong>Gerry Armstrong</strong> Former Tottenham and Northern Ireland striker</p> <p><strong>No</strong></p> <p>The fans may feel that the club are in no better a position now than they were 18-20 months ago but you have to delve deeply into the workings of the club to understand the situation and the turmoil. The manager is not solely accountable. The people who make the signings, who make the decisions on who does and doesn't come in have to hold their hands up. Damien Comolli, the sporting director, should certainly be one of them, as should Daniel Levy.</p> <p>I saw the line-up for Tottenham's game at the weekend and there was<br>\u00a330m worth of players on the bench. There have been more than \u00a3100m worth of comings and goings and when you have got so many new signings, it is hardly surprising that the results are not immediate and that confidence is so low. I don't blame the manager for that. Yes, the buck will stop with him and that isn't fair but that's life in football. </p> <p>So many of the players are struggling to adapt to life in the Premier League that it is difficult for them to play as a team. I feel sorry for players like Luka Modric who come into this environment, speaking very little English, and having to get used to what their team-mates are all about. Spurs need time; the manager must be given time to get the best out of them.</p> <p>You don't suddenly turn from winners into losers overnight. Under Ramos, the club won the Carling Cup last season and played some fantastic football. They have lost Keane and Berbatov but they still have a squad good enough to pull themselves out of this hole. However, it is going to take three to six months for this group of players to start playing as a team and we have to be realistic about that. </p> <p>It is the established players who are going to have to start taking responsibility as well, pull their fingers out and push themselves to their limits. What is disappointing is that there doesn't seem to be a leader on the pitch. If you look at teams like Arsenal and Manchester United over the years, they have had the likes of Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane, leaders who were putting in 100% to drive the team on.</p> <p>It is unfair when a manager is reportedly given only five or six games<br>supposedly to save their job. The clubs who come out of situations like this are the ones who don't panic. Spurs need to take a leaf out of Fulham's book. Last year I thought they were going to be relegated and there was no way out of it. But the key was that Roy Hodgson believed in himself and made the players believe in each other. Everyone at Tottenham is in this together and that's what they have to remember.</p>",
  "<p>Bill Clinton will tomorrow officially set aside wounded feelings that arose from the Democrats' long and bitter primary contest as he heads out to Florida to hold his first rally for Barack Obama.</p> <p>It comes more than a month after Clinton's emotional endorsement speech at the Democrats' convention and amid new speculation about whether he really wants Obama to win the White House.</p> <p>Clinton's potential to inflict damage on Obama's prospects was underlined again today when John McCain released a new television ad using a clip of the former president to attack the Democrats.</p> <p>Clinton's two appearances in the politically volatile Orlando and Fort Pierce areas mark his first in the general election season.

  "<p>The Republican Sarah Palin and her officials in the Alaskan state government drew on the work of at least six scientists known to be sceptical about the dangers and causes of global warming, to back efforts to stop polar bears being protected as an endangered species, the Guardian can disclose. Some of the scientists were funded by the oil industry. </p> <p>In official submissions to the US government's consultation on the status of the polar bear, Palin and her team referred to at least six scientists who have questioned either the existence of warming as a largely man-made phenomenon or its severity. One paper was partly funded by the US oil company ExxonMobil.</p> <p>The status of the polar bear has become a battleground in the debate on global warming. In May the US department of the interior rejected Palin's objections and listed the bear as a threatened species, saying that two-thirds of the world's polar bears were likely to be extinct by 2050 due to the rapid melting of the sea ice. Palin, governor of Alaska and the Republican nominee for US vice-president, responded last month by suing the federal government, to try to overturn the ruling. The case will be heard in January.</p> <p>Though the state of Alaska has no polar bear specialists on its staff, the governor's stance has pitted it against the combined scientific fire-power of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Geological Survey, and world experts on the mammal.</p> <p>In its lawsuit, Alaska said it opposed the endangered label partly because the listing would \"deter activities such as \u2026 oil and gas exploration and development\". Oil companies recently bid $2.7bn (\u00a31.5bn) for rights to explore the Chuckchi sea, an established polar bear habitat.</p> <p>The threatened species status might also impede the building of an Alaskan natural gas pipeline, which Palin has called the \"will of God\". In a letter last year to the US interior secretary, Dirk Kempthorne, she said she believed the polar bear population was \"abundant, stable and unthreatened by direct human activity\". She opposed the call for the listing because it \"did not use the best available scientific and commercial information\".</p> <p>Her own Alaskan review of the science drew on a joint paper by seven authors, four of whom were well-known climate- change contrarians. Her paper argued that it was \"certainly premature, if not impossible\" to link temperature rise in Alaska with human CO2 emissions.</p> <p>The paper, entitled Polar Bears of Western Hudson Bay and Climate Change, has been criticised for relying on old research and ignoring evidence that Arctic sea-ice is melting at a quickening pace. Walt Meier, a world authority on sea ice, based at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, said: \"The paper doesn't measure up scientifically.\"</p> <p>One co-author of the paper, Willie Soon, completed the study with funding from ExxonMobil \u2014 which has oil operations in Alaska's North Slope \u2014 as well as from the American Petroleum Institute. Soon was a former senior scientist with the George C Marshall Institute, which acts as an incubator for climate-change scepticism. The institute has received $715,000 in funding from ExxonMobil since 1998. </p> <p>In May, ExxonMobil announced that it was no longer funding Marshall and other groups linked with contrarian views. It said this was to avoid \"distraction from the need to provide energy while reducing greenhouse gas emissions\" and stressed that the company did not \"control the research itself\".</p> <p>Another co-author of the document was Sallie Baliunas. In 2003 she and Soon were criticised when it was revealed that a joint paper had been partially funded by the American Petroleum Institute. Thirteen scientists whom they cited issued a rebuttal and several editors of the journal Climate Research resigned because of the \"flawed peer review\". A third co-author of the polar bear study, David Legates, a professor at Delaware University, is also associated with the Marshall Institute.</p> <p>The citation by Palin and her officials prompted complaints from Congress. One member, Brad Miller, dubbed the polar bear study phony science. <br>Palin told Miller: \"Attempts to discredit scientists...simply because their analyses do not agree with your views, would be a disservice to this country.\" Miller now says that Palin's use of the paper shows she differs greatly from John McCain, the Republican presidential contender, who has pressed for scientific integrity. \"Turning to the cottage industry of scientists who are funded because they spread doubt about global warming is not integrity,\" Miller said.</p> <p>Palin's submission consulted J Scott Armstrong, a specialist in forecasting, who regards the global warming issue as \"public hysteria\". </p> <p>Two other contrarian scholars were cited. One was Syun-Ichi Akasofu, formerly director of the International Arctic Research Centre, in Alaska, who argues that climate change could be a hangover from the -little ice age. He is a founding director of the Heartland Institute, a thinktank that has received $676,500 from ExxonMobil since 1998. </p> <p>Timothy Ball, a retired professor from Winnipeg, is cited for his climate and polar bear research. He has called human-made global warming \"the greatest deception in the history of science\". He has worked with both Friends of Science, and the Natural Resources Stewardship Project, which each had funding from energy firms. </p> <p>Kert Davies, research director at Greenpeace US, said the state of Alaska under Palin's leadership had relied on scholars who argue the opposite view to that of the overwhelming consensus in the scientific community. \"It shows that she is completely out of touch with the urgency of the climate crisis.\"<br>Last month Palin agreed that the Alaskan climate was changing but added: \"I'm not one though who would attribute it to being man-made.\" She later tried to retract the statement.</p>",
  "<p>As the Russian forces invaded Georgia, the <a href=\"http://www.osce.org/\">Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)</a> found itself fighting for relevance and influence. Russia recently stopped the organisation from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/23/georgia.russia\">sending unarmed observers</a> to the breakaway republic of South Ossetia. This is bad news for the OSCE, which is trying to carve more than a niche role for itself.</p> <p>The OSCE emerged out of the <a href=\"http://www.csce.gov/\">CSCE</a>, which was the security and cooperation dialogue launched in 1974 in Helsinki \u2013 the Helsinki Process and the Helsinki Final Act \u2013 between the Soviets and the west. It stretches from Vancouver to Vladivostok comprising 53 member states and a handful of observer states. It operates a number of missions on the ground in the Balkans, East Europe, South Caucasus, and Central Asia.</p> <p>Russia and many of the CIS states <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/08/russia.eu\">criticise the organisation routinely</a> for over-focusing on the human dimension. They describe the election monitors, and OSCE's human rights and media work as western ploys aimed at regime change. They fear that revolutions, such as what happened in Ukraine and Georgia, will soon arrive at their doorstep. Still, these countries all face serious security challenges, from porous borders, to problems with organised crime, corruption, institutional weakness and economic underdevelopment, which is why they are reluctant to simply walk out of the OSCE. The OSCE is also the only security organisation where Central Asia and Caucasus states sit behind the same table as western powers, and have an equal say in the process.</p> <p>On the other side are the US and some of its allies who would rather not invest in strengthening the organisation, but use it as a toolbox for dealing with problems no one else wants or is able to tackle. Washington wants the OSCE in Afghanistan. This is wrong. The internal processes of this massive security organisation are too cumbersome for an environment that is highly volatile and where decisions have to be made quickly. It is being set up to fail, and when it does, the sceptics will have yet another reason to pull the plug.</p> <p>The safer bet is to re-energise the organisation by increasing its stake in security, stability and economic progress in the broader Caucasus-Caspian region. The OSCE has ample experience in this area, a number of on-the-ground missions setup and running, and a reason to be here. There is a fair degree of success in terms of projects completed by the OSCE in the Caucasus-Caspian region already.</p> <p>The key is in finding a partner country that can lift the organisation's profile in the Caucasus-Caspian region. This cannot be a western state, or Russia. But Kazakhstan can do it when it takes over the OSCE chairmanship in 2010.</p> <p>This flamboyant central Asian republic, biggest in terms of territory in the group of stans and rich with energy, Kazakhstan has always had an interest in greater regional development and stability, and kept up its good relations with all neighbours, particularly with Russia and China, and its strategic long-distance partner the US. Kazakhstan already played a major role in stabilising the situation in <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/section/Kyrgyzstan/159.html\">Kyrgyzstan</a> in 2005 when fighting broke out there, and Astana has extended a helping hand to Tajikistan and others. It is working closely now with Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan on trans-Caspian energy projects, and with Uzbekistan on the development and export of raw materials. So far, Kazakhstan has been vocal on the regional economic platform, but Astana can initiate a regional security and cooperation dialogue as well.</p> <p>Following the conflict in Georgia, both Azerbaijan and Armenia are under pressure, which raises the risk of violence over <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/3658938.stm\">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>. The territory, occupied by Armenian forces, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/03/turkey.armenia\">disputed</a>. The Armenians claim it is needed as a buffer. This is an unsustainable reality, and it contradicts all principles and norms of international law.</p> <p>Turkey tried to defuse the tension by reaching out to Armenia and suggesting to Baku that Ankara be the new chaperone of the peace process. This is a good move, which Baku and Yerevan could come to embrace. Kazakhstan can add its weight behind this process too, by offering its direct and active support as the incoming leader of the OSCE. It would be smart for the Kazakhs to appoint a special representative of their government responsible for the Nagorno-Karabakh frozen conflict. If this conflict is resolved, the biggest obstacle to regional cooperation in the South Caucasus will be removed, which will profoundly change Central Asia's relations with Europe. The two will grow closer. For Kazakhstan this opportunity should be a matter of strategic priority.</p> <p>If Kazakhstan succeeds in reviving the OSCE's regional role this will quiet the sceptics. Also, by convincing Russia and the CIS that OSCE is not about regime change but about regional cooperation, security and economic development, Kazakhstan will silence the critics. It is therefore not an overstatement to suggest that the future of the OSCE is now in the hands of Kazakhstan.</p>",
  "<p>Electoral reform is a difficult sell at the Conservative party conference; promoting it sometimes seems like trying to sell Chelsea tractors at the Greens' annual gathering. But there are some stirrings, and some new arguments about the constitution and elections are being heard at Birmingham. Tories who support proportional representation have in the past tended to be liberal in their general approach, but reform is finding some adherents among hard-edged right wingers such as Douglas Carswell, MP for Harwich since 2005 and one of the more interesting thinkers within the Tory party \u2013 one of the few MPs who can refer to Weber and Gramsci and sound as if he knows what he is talking about.</p> <p>Representation in parliament is one of the last monopoly public services left. Carswell asked at an <a href=\"http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/\">Electoral Reform Society</a> fringe meeting in Birmingham why it was that in a world where people are used to shopping around, telephones and electricity had been made competitive, there was still a single supplier of representative services that you had to like or lump. In an environment where consumer choice is the dominant force, and people increasingly look at politics as consumers, why not have multi-member constituencies? Competition and choice improve standards. Lazy MPs, or those who did not represent the views of their constituents properly, would face internal competition, and there would be fewer barriers to new talent and new ideas coming forward. While Carswell is vague on which electoral system he favours with his multi-member seats, his vision is perfectly compatible with the long-term electoral reform goal of the <a href=\"http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/votingsystems/systems3.htm\">Single Transferable Vote</a> (STV). It is also part of Conservative history \u2013 after all, Disraeli introduced the three-member boroughs and the \"limited vote\" in 1867.</p> <p>Carswell is very much a maverick Conservative, and he was joined on the ERS panel by more familiar Tory voices. Eleanor Laing represented the pleasant, moderate face of Tory partisanship and constitutional immobilism, and Bruce Anderson adopted his familiar role as the voice of candid reaction who frankly acknowledged the benefits of elective dictatorship \u2013 as long as it was the Conservative party doing the dictating. </p> <p>I doubt that many opponents of the Conservatives would be unduly worried by the arguments of Laing or Anderson, but Carswell's case would be unsettling. He uses reforming language to <a href=\"http://stores.lulu.com/renewbritain\">argue</a> for quite radical Conservative projects \u2013 a more securely founded Conservative government would have the hegemony necessary to deal with the alleged progressive bias of the broadcast media, the civil service and the education system. Carswell also favours direct democracy and the right of recall. His embrace of change is based on more intellectual self-confidence than the old fashioned belief in grabbing the controls of the machinery of the centralised, elitist British state and making it serve Tory ends. New Conservative constitutional reformers can talk confidently about trusting the people, because they believe that the people ultimately agree with them. And left of centre constitutional reformers feel some anxiety that Carswell may be right about this. The interesting debate may end up being between radical Conservative direct democracy, and progressive reformers trying to define the acceptable limits of popular control. </p> <p>Unfortunately, neither front bench seems interested. Labour's increasing timidity about constitutional reform is sad indeed. From the radical change promised (and largely implemented) in 1997, the party now trumpets reforms such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/26/constitution.anglicanism\">changing the Act of Succession</a> to make the first-born, rather than the first-born son, heir to the throne, as radical. This reform affects one, theoretical, person in perhaps 70 years' time. The Conservatives are vaguely aware that the current electoral system is biased against them, but grumble in an entirely ill-informed fashion about constituency boundaries. Their main solution is to try to game the current system better than Labour by swamping marginal constituencies with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/01/electoralreform.partyfunding\">Ashcroft money</a>. It may work in the short term, but it is a cynical exercise in gaining and maintaining power on a minimum of public support that will ultimately do politics no good. It is a sign of how seductive the embrace of the Westminster establishment is that neither main party really intends to do much to shake up the power structure.</p>",
  "<p>After Black Monday, 2008 style, came Turnaround Tuesday. Although in truth, compared to Monday's 777.7 point fall on Wall Street and 269.7 decline in London, it was not much of a recovery.</p> <p>The<strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ftse\">FTSE 100</a></strong> climbed 83.7 points to 4902.5, helped by a recovery among the miners and a rise of around 250 points on Wall Street by the time London closed. Part of the revival was due to a growing hope that the US Treasury's $700bn bank bail-out plan could yet be saved before the end of the week, albeit with some tweaking.</p> <p>Alex Potter of Collins Stewart said: \"Most commentators appear to be expecting a watered-down bill second time around. The margin of defeat (225-208) was relatively small, so some small concessions would appear likely to secure the bill.\"</p> <p>On top of that came talk that the US Federal Reserve might sanction an emergency interest rate cut before its next scheduled meeting at the end of October, perhaps as part of a concerted effort with other central bankers including the Bank of England and the ECB. Investors chose to ignore news that overnight dollar libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other - had more than doubled, another sign of how frozen the money markets are at the moment.</p> <p>Much of the FTSE 100's gain was due to mining stocks. <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/xstrata\">Xstrata</a></strong> added 138p to \u00a317.16 ahead of Thursday's deadline for the company to firm up its proposed \u00a333 a share offer for platinum specialist <strong>Lonmin</strong>, up 166p to \u00a322.74p. Many in the City believe Xstrata is likely to press ahead with the deal, despite the current market turmoil. But if it walks away, Lonmin's shares are likely to drop dramatically.</p> <p>UBS analyst Paul Galloway said: \"We believe that Xstrata's valuation of the Lonmin assets is unlikely to have fundamentally changed in the past seven weeks, so the question is can it get the $9.5bn of financing required? Overall, we believe this is possible but for investors of Lonmin this is risky.\"</p> <p>Still in the sector, <strong>Antofagasta</strong> added 4.25p to 400p as Citigroup repeated its buy recommendation but cut its price target from 800p to 600p to reflect a reduction in its copper price forecasts.</p> <p>Most of the banks recovered from their worst levels, awaiting news on whether the bail-out could be resurrected. The main exception was <strong>HBOS</strong>, down 19.6p to 122.4p on talk that <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong> may revise down the terms of its offer for the mortgage bank. Lloyds added 9.25p to 226.5p, valuing each HBOS share at around 188p.</p> <p><strong>Icap</strong>, the interdealer broker, was the biggest faller on Monday and the biggest gainer today. The company, which ironically benefits from market volatility, added 65.75p to 355p as house broker Merrill Lynch said the shares had been oversold and issued a buy recommendation. Merrill was also positive on hedge fund manager <strong>Man Group</strong>, up 31.25p to 336.75p.</p> <p>Merrill said: \"Man's share price has been buffeted recently by a range of worries \u2013 the effect of the shorting ban, potential reduction of prime brokerage and so on. We believe that Man's business is excellently placed to ride out these squalls. It has little or no dependence on equity long/short and benefits from global distribution.

  "<p>Illegal logging has sharply accelerated destruction of the Amazon and the biggest culprit is the Brazilian government, according to new evidence.</p> <p>Officials are expected to face criminal charges after satellite imagery revealed the worst-hit regions belonged to the Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform, or Incra, a state agency which distributes land.</p> <p>The top 100 illegal loggers, with Incra at the top, would be sued, the environment minister, Carlos Minc, told a news conference. \"It was a terrible result. We're going to blow all 100 of them out of the water and then some.\"</p> <p>Official data released on Monday showed that 292 square miles of rainforest were chopped down in August, more than twice the rate for the same month last year. The National Institute of Space Studies said its findings would probably have been even worse had it obtained images of a quarter of the forest covered by dense clouds in August.</p> <p>Until recently Brazil's government highlighted an apparent slowdown in the rate of deforestation as proof of conservation success. This week's announcement was all the more embarrassing because the six largest deforested areas since 2005 were owned by Incra.</p> <p>Officials tasked with distributing land to the poor, along with vote-chasing mayors and other politicians in the Amazon, were accused of turning a blind eye to the tree-felling by peasants, big landowners and logging companies.</p> <p>Upcoming elections aggravated the trend, said the environment minister, who blamed expanded agricultural activity as well as land theft through the falsification of property titles.</p> <p>\"When you have elections, the appetite of authorities to enforce laws is reduced,\" said Paulo Adario, of the advocacy group Greenpeace. \"But the federal government has to step in and do its job.\"</p> <p>Adario also blamed the dramatic global food price increases for encouraging cattle ranchers and soy farmers to push deeper into the forest and clear land. \"The tendency of deforestation rising is deeply related to the fact that food prices are going up.\"</p> <p>Big landowners have long argued that poor peasants resettled by Incra were driving the deforestation, a view bolstered by the estimates that since 2005 some 223,000 hectares (550,000 acres) of forest were destroyed on six Incra properties.</p> <p>Incra's president, Rolf Hackbart, defended his agency by saying the affected areas had in fact been legally settled between 1995 and 2002. It was not immediately possible to verify the conflicting claims.</p> <p>Other figures released by the environment ministry showed that private land holders deforested more than three times as much as Incra between January and August of this year, suggesting soy and cattle barons are still causing far more damage.</p> <p>The government's green credentials have been under intense scrutiny since Marina Silva, a high-profile champion of the rainforest, quit as environment minister in May following bruising battles with cabinet colleagues.</p> <p>Minc, her successor, said the government will create an environmental police force with 3,000 heavily armed and specially trained officers to help protect the Amazon.</p>",

  "<p>Some people believe that being progressive involves little more than being nice. Others, particularly on the left, set a much higher hurdle and they refuse to accept that there's anything remotely progressive about David Cameron's Conservative party. Now, for the first time, I've heard a detailed explanation of what the Tories really mean when they use this label to describe themselves.<br><br>It came from Oliver Letwin, the chairman of the Conservative party's policy review and the intellectual guru of Cameronian Conservatism. He was speaking at an IPPR fringe meeting this morning. The attendance was pretty sparse - it was 8am - and that was a shame because all the political parties are fighting for the right to wear the badge \"progressive\" and Letwin's comments were illuminating.</p> <p>The Tories now says they are committed to achieving progressive ends by Conservative means. So we started with some definitions.</p> <h2>What are progressive ends?</h2> <p>Letwin identified four: 1. \"Getting people out of the condition of multiple deprivation.\" 2. \"Trying to get the public services to be as good as they could be.\" 3. \"Trying to make sure that we hand our environment down to the next generation in a decent shape.\" 4. The relief of global poverty.</p> <p>He accepted that these were not uniquely Conservative goals and that all the main parties would sign up to them.</p> <h2>That doesn't sound like Thatcher</h2> <p>David Aaronovitch, the Times columnist who chaired the event, said that these four aims hadn't always seemed like Conservative party priorities. Letwin agreed that when Margaret Thatcher came to power she concentrated on the economy, but he didn't accept that the four goals were not important. </p> <h2>And what about equality?</h2> <p>Letwin didn't mention equality as one of his four progressive ends. But the subject came up when he took questions as one activist urged him to accept that equality of outcome and equality of opportunity were not Conservative goals. Another Tory said that fairness and freedom were both \"philosophical goods\" and that, while Labour believed more in fairness, the Conservatives believed more in freedom.</p> <p>Letwin did not agree. He said that the Conservatives had always been committed to equality of opportunity and that he did not think that was even controversial in the party.</p> <p>But he went further, making a modest nod in the direction of equality of outcome. </p> <blockquote> <p>I think that the achievement of the diminution of extreme inequality of outcome in our society is an important social good ... I do really believe that. I do really very strongly believe that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Letwin said he thought there was a cross-party consensus about this.</p> <h2>So what about the inheritance tax?</h2> <p>Aaronovitch asked how the Tories could square a commitment to reducing extreme inequality with their decision to raise the inheritance tax threshold, making it easier for rich children to inherit property. Letwin claimed there were good reasons for allowing people to accumulate capital and that this was \"in no way incompatible\" with what he said about equality.</p> <p>Aaronovitch wasn't convinced, although Letwin took pleasure in pointing out that, after the Tories announced their inheritance tax plans last year, Labour responded with something similar.</p> <h2>What was wrong with the Labour means?</h2> <p>Having accepted that all parties shared his progressive goals, Letwin then explained why he thought Labour wasn't achieving them. </p> <blockquote> <p>Their principle idea has been to identify the bureaucratic lever that will achieve a fairly rapid effect, legislate that bureaucratic lever into existence and then pull that ... We could characterise the last 11 years as putting a very consistent effort into designing those levers, finding that one doesn't work, then designing another and another and another.</p> </blockquote> <p>Letwin said this approach generally had not led to significant improvements in relation to poverty, the public services or the environment. (He did not take issue with Labour's record on global poverty.)</p> <h2>So what are the \"Conservative means\" he's proposing?</h2> <p>Letwin said the argument between the parties was now largely one about means, not ends. Specifically, it revolved around \"very different views of how effective a central bureaucracy really is\".</p> <p>The Tories were committed to using \"post-bureaucratic means\". That meant creating a framework that would enable civil society, social enterprises and the voluntary sector to deal with the sort of problems he had identified. Letwin said that devolving power to local communities would be an important part of this. A Conservative green paper on local government being published soon would propose a \"huge shift\" of power towards communities.</p> <h2>Jon Cruddas was right</h2> <p>In a pamphlet published recently called <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/publications/\">Is the Future Conservative?</a> Jon Cruddas, the Labour MP, said his party should accept that the Conservatives were changing and that what Cameron was developing was a communitarianism of the centre-right. Letwin said: \"He's correctly identified what I'm about.\"</p> <h2>But can it work? The model Tory community</h2> <p>Aaronovitich suggested that the idea that localism and civil society offered the solution to problems like poverty sounded like \"magic\". For example, how would this help with a problem like housing?</p> <p>At this point Letwin's eyes lit up like someone who felt he was about to clinch the argument. There was a pretty village in his Dorset constituency, Buckland Newton, that showed exactly how his policies could succeed, he said.</p> <p>For years the villagers opposed plans for new houses to be built in the village. But when a community land trust was set up to develop plans for social housing in consultation with residents, with houses reserved for locals, residents suddenly felt they had an incentive to cooperate. They attended meetings en masse and the homes were built.</p> <p>But it didn't stop there, Letwin went on. Residents who had got to know each other through the community land trust came together to negotiate a deal to save a local post office. And now they are working on a community shop. Letwin said the lessons were wide-ranging. \"You live differently when you live in a community that operates in this way.\"</p> <p>You may not be at all convinced. But if Cameronian Conservatism ever does achieve any of the aims it has set itself, you could argue that it all started in Buckland Newton.</p>",
  "<p>House prices in the US posted their sharpest ever annual decline in July, with prices in cities such as Las Vegas falling by almost 30%.</p> <p>According to the Standard &amp; Poor's/Case-Shiller 20-city housing index, prices were 16.3% lower in July than a year ago \u2014 the largest fall in the survey's eight-year history. </p> <p>A second measure, the 10-city index, dropped 17.5%, the biggest decline in its 21-year history and the 10th consecutive monthly fall.</p> <p>S&amp;P Index committee chairman David Blitzer warned he saw \"no evidence\" that the worst housing recession in a generation had reached the bottom. </p> <p>The survey said homeowners in many cities had seen \"double digit\" declines in the value of their homes, far worse than the downturn of the 1990s, when the biggest fall recorded was 6.3%. </p> <p>The worst-hit part of the country is the so-called Sun Belt, where cities such as Las Vegas, Phoenix and Miami saw property prices fall by 29.9%, 29.3% and 28.2% respectively, compared with the same month a year ago. </p> <p>\"The Sun Belt continues to be the story, with the seven cities that represent the area reporting annual declines of between 20% and 30%,\" said Blitzer.</p> <p>But house prices fell in all 20 cities tracked by the survey. </p> <p>The collapsing housing market is at the heart of the crisis in global financial markets as declining demand pushes down property values and indebted consumers default on their loans. The 20-City index is down nearly 20% from the US housing market's peak in July 2006.</p> <p>There was a glimmer of hope for US homeowners, with S&amp;P highlighting that the rate of monthly declines had begun to slow. In the three months to July, total house prices fell 2.2%, compared with falls of 6% to 6.5% in the two previous quarters.</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4 Education faces a 10% budget cut next year but plans to \"do more\" on a smaller budget with a tranche of digital media projects announced today.</p> <p>Janie Walker, the head of education, said the broadcaster is under \"huge commercial pressure\" and consequently the department would feel the effect of budgets and job cuts next year - but she insisted education was \"more ring-fenced\" than some Channel 4 operations.</p> <p>\"We'll see around a 10% reduction in spend next year, but in terms of what we do, we feel we can still do the same and more,\" she said. The current education budget is \u00a36m for 2008, and is likely to be cut to \u00a35.4m for 2009.</p> <p>\"We're beginning to look at partnerships and co-funding and we should be able to do that. There is the money around, and there are lots of people trying to find ways to get education to teens on different platforms.</p> <p>\"We are looking ahead at ways to do that, and now we have the slate to take to people.\"</p> <p>The latest slate of nine projects includes Embarrassing Teenage Bodies, which allows teens to send in photos and questions on issues including \"normal\" body parts and pregnancy, a spin-off of The Family which asks teens to discuss teenage behaviour and relationships with their families, and Lifeproof, in which teens ask their friends for advice on issues.</p> <p>Projects are aimed at 14- to 19-year-olds and are increasingly focused online, with content distributed through YouTube, Bebo, MySpace, MSN, and the Israeli animation site Aniboom. </p> <p>Channel 4's strategy is to distribute content online to try to attract a larger audience among its target 14- to 19-year-olds, most of whom would not be in front of a TV during the traditional weekday morning slots.</p> <p>The TV component for these projects are first broadcast this autumn, but most have already been running online for some time.</p> <p>The Sexperience website helped build a significant online audience before the sex education show aired on TV, recording 3m page views in three weeks. </p> <p>Walker said that Channel 4 has a different tone to material provided by the BBC or NHS.</p> <p>\"We link to the NHS, but the bleach-smelling white environment is not conducive to asking questions, and sometimes it seems the BBC's version tries to be more definitive,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Channel 4 wants to give a range of answers to make people better able to make their own decisions.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>To paraphrase Tolstoy, all Labour governments are unhappy in the same way. Sure, the process may be delayed by the odd pleasant decade of global low inflation and low interest rates. But sooner or later, they all end in a bust. That's why the most important part of George Osborne's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/29/toryconference.economy\">speech</a> was not the eye-catching council tax freeze he announced, but the more mundane machinery of his new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/28/toryconference.conservatives2\">Office for Budget Responsibility</a>.</p> <p>The problem for the Tories is simple. Spending more is now becoming a one-way bet for Gordon Brown. His credibility is more or less shot, so why not ramp up public expenditure anyway before the election? Either it helps him get re-elected, against the odds, in which case he has five more years. Or he loses and the Tories have to clear up a huge mess.</p> <p>So what to do? One solution is an obvious non-starter: to put in<br>place a public framework of rules against which people can benchmark our escalating budget deficit, and any subsequent progress towards stability which the Tories if elected might make. That would never fly. For as Brown has demonstrated, even apparently clear fiscal rules can in fact be fudged.</p> <p>The new Conservative approach, however, is set up to bypass this difficulty and go to the root of the problem. The Office for Budget Responsibility is designed to be an independent fiscal watchdog. Government retains the ability to tax and spend, as democracy requires. But with the new Office surveying the books, it should be much clearer for the public and for outside experts and commentators to see what is actually happening \u2013 both from the outset of a new administration, and as the fiscal position changes. Whether they like what they see is another matter, of course ...</p> <p>Some people may regard the new office as just another quango. But<br>actually it is a crucial and rather innovative move towards restoring<br>some independent credibility for the exchequer. And it fits well with the Tories' broader <a href=\"http://www.jessenorman.com/politics/\">compassionate conservative</a> emphasis on decentralisation, intelligent institutional change and constitutional separation of powers.

  "<p>The cost of borrowing overnight dollars on global money markets surged today despite central banks flooding the markets with liquidity to prevent them from seizing up any further after Congress rejected a $700bn (\u00a3380bn) bail-out package. </p> <p>The British Bankers' Association said the London interbank offered rate (Libor) for dollar funds, the rate at which banks charge each others for loans, saw its biggest ever one-day jump of 431 basis points, taking it to 6.88%, the highest level in more than seven years.</p> <p>Separately, the European Banking Federation said the euro interbank offered rate - Euribor - for one-month loans climbed to a record 5.05%.</p> <p>\"Money markets are more of a problem than stock markets. Perceived counterparty credit risk ... probably won't go away for a while,\" said Everett Brown, strategist at IDEAGlobal.</p> <p>He said the likelihood of a revived bail-out package for Wall Street would help ease rates. \"They will come down a bit over coming days and weeks due to the U.S. package (probably) getting passed, more of these central bank liquidity operations going through, and the end of the quarter getting out of the way,\" he said.</p> <p>There has been a series of cash injections into the money markets by central banks in the past two days following the collapse of a handful of banks and the surprise rejection of Congress's rescue plan overnight.</p> <p>The Bank of England made an injection of \u00a340bn of three-month funding on Monday and a separate $10bn of overnight funds today. On Monday the US Federal Reserve increased its reciprocal dollar fund swap arrangements to $620bn - more than double the previous amount.</p> <p>The European Central Bank lent $30bn of overnight dollar funding to commercial banks today at a rate of 11% - nearly five times the Federal Reserve's official rate of 2% - after the US Congress rejected the $70bn bail-out package. </p> <p>The central banks of Japan, Australia, Britain and the eurozone injected liquidity into their respective banking systems to help banks meet funding obligations over the coming days, weeks and months.</p> <p>Three-month interbank rates also rose in London but by much less than overnight rates. Dollar rates rose to 4.05% from 3.88% yesterday. Sterling rates rose to 6.3% from 6.27%, the highest so far this year and euro three-month rates rose to 5.27% from 5.22%.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Justin Urquhart Stewart</strong> at <strong>Killik's Seven Investment Management</strong> said: \"The market seems to be on eggshells. People are very concerned about taking positions anywhere at all. They are covering some positions ... It's the calm before the next storm.\"</p> <p>He believes the controversial $700bn US bail-out package will get passed eventually. In yesterday's House of Representatives vote, \"an awful lot wanted to vote for it but didn't want to be seen voting for it\" ahead of congressional elections in November, he said, adding now that their protest has been registered congressmen can approve a modified package. </p> <p>But, he pointed out, the rescue plan \"just gets some of the poison out of the wound\" rather than heal it. \"The banks need to have more confidence in each other to get lending going again,\" he added. </p> <p>On the sharp falls in the Royal Bank of Scotland share price, he said that ever since the group took over Dutch bank ABN Amro \"RBS has been lying there like a python that has swallowed a pig\". It has also been hit by the woes of Fortis, its partner in the ABN deal, which had to be bailed out this week. </p> <p>\"RBS has got nothing wrong with it at all\", he said.</p> <p>Amid talk of possible interest rate cuts by major central banks, Urquhart Stewart said: \"Rate cuts in the US won't get us very far.\" But he thought the Bank of England should cut rates in light of the worsening economic outlook and signs that inflation is beginning to ease.</p> <p><strong>Jeremy Batstone-Carr</strong> at <strong>Charles Stanley</strong> stockbrokers said: \"The initial lurch down [in the FTSE 100] was driven by Asian markets and fears that we could see some weakness on Wall Street after the terrible, terrible close last night. But it quickly became apparent that it was a badly worded package and that maybe a better worded package will ensue.\"</p> <p>He thought concerted action taken by major central banks to pump billions into the financial system in the last fortnight had \"paid off\". Good numbers from Tesco also helped lift sentiment on the stock market. But he added: \"The banks are not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination.\"</p> <p>He noted that HBOS' share price got hit by worries that its takeover by Lloyds TSB might have to be renegotiated. \"Whether it's genuine concern or just a function of dislocated markets remains to be seen.\"</p> <p>Batstone-Carr thought the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England should cut interest rates.</p> <p><strong>David Buik</strong> at <strong>BGC Partners </strong>said at 9.30am this morning, the FTSE 100 had already turned round a 146 point deficit to stand up 29 points at 4848. \"Who would have believed it?\" he asked. \"Once Wall Street had fallen by the best part of 7% [yesterday] we looked as though we would be in for a bit of a larruping.... There have also been huge reversals on the mining sector which opened hanging in rags and is now in positive territory with Anglo American, Rio and Xstrata making great gains. </p> <p>\"The reason for the turnaround is that we headless chickens are facing across the pond and we note that the Dow futures have rallied by the best part of 215 points, which ventures to suggest that the self indulgent hillbilly behaviour of Congress will eventually see an agreement to the Hank Paulson plan on Thursday or Friday. There is no alternative unless they are inviting deep depression, recession and anarchy across the spectrum. The sooner the world at large accepts that banks are the artery to the infrastructure and fabric of society, the better. Without strong banks we have nothing and no aspirations to boot.\"</p> <p>Asked why the the FTSE rallied this morning, <strong>David Evans</strong>, market analyst at <strong>BetOnMarkets.com</strong>, said there was \"no single big piece of news behind it. But people thought that once the bailout bill was not passed the floor would drop out of the market. It may be that people are surprised that there's not more of a negative reaction. An element of 'Hang on we're still alive'.\"</p> <p>He said talk of interest rate cuts could also be a factor. \"If the markets crash then there could be big emergency measures. But actually it would be more of a worry if the rally is being driven by those kind of expectations, as there is a greater chance of them being dashed.\"</p> <p><strong>Christian Gattiker</strong>, head of research &amp; equity strategy at <strong>Julius Baer</strong>, predicted further volatility created by forced sellers. He said: \"The negative surprise in the political process exacerbates the current distress in the financial space. This is best illustrated by the Ted spread index, which shows risk premiums required for short-term cash lending among banks. The Ted spread was already at record levels before the rejection of the rescue plan and sky-rocketed thereafter. </p> <p>\"This indicates further distress as forced sellers (i.e. financial players) are likely to reduce positions into an illiquid market. This is likely to create further volatility and selling pressure in financial assets first, but will create opportunities down the road. In global stockmarkets, the current sell-off should open new opportunities for corporate buyers. Non-financial corporates on average are better capitalized than at this stage during previous downswings. Hence, a likely pick-up in corporate M&amp;A activity would be supportive for equities.\"</p> <p>He advised investors: \"This is not the time to make major portfolio shifts. Highly leveraged players will have to sell into illiquid markets, creating both volatility and downside pressure. Investors should focus on quality, liquidity, funding, and support. Capital preservation remains the ultimate goal in these markets.\"</p> <p><strong>Neil Dwane</strong> at <strong>RCM</strong>, owned by Allianz Global Investors, said: \"It remains a farce that central banks are not now pouring huge amounts of money into the banking markets and taking any types of paper with a reasonable haircut as well as just pumping money into the economy. This may be inflationary medium term, but a depression is easily the worst scenario. We must see this week a coordinated cut in interest rates globally, including the BOJ, ECB, FED, BOE and others like the BOC. </p> <p>\"US Housing should be on track to be heading to the end of its downward path by the autumn of next year and thus policymakers should have all the plans in place to ensure the great global reflationary response between now and then.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We are very nearly at the key point of capitulation in investor sentiment in the markets, but the longer term prognosis for the global equity markets remains good as we enter a world increasingly led by the billions of mankind now just emerging into the urbanised and industrialised society that is the OECD today. A tremendous generational buying opportunity has drawn near.\"</p>",
  "<p>Away from the financials, there are some bright spots. Telecoms group <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/cablewireless\">Cable &amp; Wireless</a></strong>, for example, is up 2.7p to 163p on growing hopes it will announce a demerger.</p> <p>Citigroup issued a buy recommendation and raised its price target from 240p to 250p. The bank said: \"News of a demerger is widely expected by the market on or before first-half results on November 10. In isolation, this is unlikely to drive a re-rating. We expect a package of measures, including confirmation of the incremental opportunities unlocked by a demerger (up to 95p a share in our view), an agenda for their implementation and a Thus integration plan with synergies.</p> <p>\"The Thus acquisition is essentially a bulk purchase of customers \u2014 we estimate synergies in excess of \u00a365m by the end of year two.\"</p> <p>And not all the banks are in the doldrums. <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/hsbcholdings\">HSBC</a></strong> is up 12.75p to 877.75p as Alex Potter of Collins Stewart recommended the stock as a safe haven. He believed HSBC would also benefit from a successful resolution to the Paulson plan.</p> <p>Potter said: \"The plan is likely to be renegotiated over the rest of this week (though with a break for Jewish new year) with a view to another vote in a week. Most commentators appear to be expecting a watered-down bill second time around. Secondly, the margin of defeat (225-208) was relatively small, so some small concessions would appear likely to secure the bill.</p> <p>\"The US government is clearly hoping that, with cleaner balance sheets, liquidity will return to the US banks and the wholesale money markets will become functional again.\"</p> <p>Clearly they are not functioning without the plan. Overnight dollar libor \u2014 the rate at which banks lend to each other \u2014 has surged from 2.56% to 6.87%, the biggest daily jump on record.</p> <p>The news was a negative for the market, but so far this has been outweighed by hopes that the $700bn bank bail-out will be rescued, and by talk that the US Federal Reserve might implement an emergency interest rate cut, perhaps in some sort of coordinated action with the Bank of England, the ECB and others.</p> <p>So the <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ftse\">FTSE 100</a></strong>, despite the current turmoil, is managing to hold on to its gains.

  "<p>Forget banks going bust and crashing stock markets. Global meltdown of the economic system? Boooooring. Down in Germany's prosperous south, there's only been one story this week: the sweeping, nay, catastrophic, nay \"crushing defeat\" (S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung) of the reigning champions. Bosses, leading players and supporters \"were in bewildered shock when confronted with the numbers\", wrote the Munich-based broadsheet after the worst set of results in 42 years. Their colleagues from M\u00fcnchner Merkur were equally stunned by the \"Super-GAU\" (the \"greatest possible accident\") and confidently predicted heads would roll after \"heavy, unacceptable losses\", \"a historic fiasco\" and \"the end of a legend\".</p> <p>Naturally the head of this whole sorry operation woke up on Tuesday to front pages predicting his imminent resignation. They don't take kindly to losers in the land of beer and money, and that's why he will have to go. Farewell, Erwin Huber, farewell.</p> <p>Erwin who? Even regular followers of \"The Life Bundesligatic with Bixente Lizarazu\", as this column used to be known a few years ago, are unlikely to have heard of poor old Hubi and there's a good reason for it: he is \u2013 or <em>was</em>, by the time you read this - the head of the Christian Social Union, the undisputed rulers in Bavaria's unofficial one-party system since 1966. Last Sunday they lost their absolute majority along with 17% of the vote, an unheard of landslide in modern German politics.</p> <p>The other big, supposedly invincible Bavarian beast isn't faring much better at the moment. Bayern Munich have close links with the CSU and dominated German football with a similar type of brashness, sense of entitlement and unwavering confidence for nearly four decades. But where J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann was inspiring his corps and superiors with sun-drenched, pro-active, motivational California-isms not long ago, deep worries about the future are now dampening the mood. After a second Bundesliga defeat in a row, <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/videodisplay/1604949/\">a limp 1-0 capitulation at Hanover</a>, M\u00fcnchner Merkur noted \"the landslide down the Bundesliga table\" and Uli Hoeness confessed to being unnerved by the number of teams in front of his own. Bayern are ninth after two wins, two draws and two defeats. This barely average return amounts to a CSU-like disaster. They haven't done worse in 31 years.</p> <p>Klinsmann says he expected these problems: \"The team's developing rapidly, new hierarchies are forming, we're newly defining ourselves, it's an intensive process\". It's impossible to say whether he truly believes this explanation. The fact that he's come into the job with bold predictions and grand visions has certainly put extra pressure on his shoulders, especially so as the gap between his ambitions and the performances widens. A manager without results can't survive in Munich for very long in any case. And Klinsmann hasn't done himself any favours by raising expectations to unrealistic levels.</p> <p>As ever, the line between tactical genius and incompetent blunderer is blurred. The 3-5-2 of the first few weeks was hailed as a master-stroke after the 1-0 away win against Steaua Bucharest. But the same tabloids are now slaughtering him and claiming it was really a non-starter and little more than a misguided experiment. You could argue about one or two line-up changes and it has lately become fashionable to cast Klinsmann as a Swabian Rafa Ben\u00edtez, a man hell-bent on reshuffling his pack needlessly. \"You can't rotate this much so early in the season\", said Klinsmann's former international colleague turned television pundit Stefen Effenberg. Look at his decisions a little closer, however, and you come away with the sense that he's been mostly guilty of the biggest managerial crime: he's been unlucky. </p> <p>\"If you rotate and lose, it's bad,\" said Mark van Bommel. \"If you don't rotate and lose, it's also bad.\" Predictably the first off-record complaints about lack of tactical instructions and other things have started to surface in the papers but they will disappear very quickly once normal order is restored. Unfortunately for Klinsmann he has to face Lyon in the Champions League tonight. It's the sort of match that can make or break your season. At the very least it really will be the \"Stimmungsendspiel\" S\u00fcddeutsche predicted, a game that will define the mood in the coming weeks. Lose against the French and Klinsmann would find himself central to a crisis that would put even the plight of the CSU in the shade.</p> <p>Werder Bremen, who are in action against Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's Inter on Wednesday, had a very different weekend. Their <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/videodisplay/1604795/\">5-4 win against Hoffenheim</a>, an insanely entertaining cavalier affair in which both defences were more exposed than Geordie lasses on a night out, was rightly described as a veritable orgy of attacking football. Think the \"Eyes Wide Shut\" party with a more satisfying climax. Werder, having been pegged back to 4-4 after leading 4-1, had a man sent off and scored a fantastic winner with nine minutes to go courtesy of Mesut \u00d6zil. His first strike had been even better, and Claudio Pizarro's cheeky heel-flick and Aaron Hunt's belter into the top corner were equally beautiful. Hoffenheim, whose manager Ralf Rangnick spoke of \"brutal disappointment\", also hit the woodwork three times. Frankfurter Allgemeine recommended burning this game onto a DVD and sending it out to potential TV rights bidders like Rupert Murdoch's Premiere.</p> <p>\"This result means that many things went wrong, but many things went right too\", said the sporting director Klaus Allofs. Yes, the Werder goal factory is churning them out again, albeit at great cost. This over-enthusiastic appetite for attacking football seems to have become emblematic of a league that has gone from methodical, stable 1-1s to crazed 5-4s. By Friday, we'll know how sustainable this business model is in the European market.</p> <p><strong>Results</strong>: K\u00f6ln 1-0 Schalke, Bremen 5-4 Hoffenheim, Hanover 1\u20130 Bayern, Hamburg 1\u20130 Gladbach, Dortmund 3\u20130 Stuttgart, Bochum 2-3 Leverkusen, Hertha 0\u20131 Cottbus, Frankfurt 1\u20131 Bielefeld, Karlsruhe 2\u20131 Wolfsburg.</p>",
  "<p>\"There's a slight air of unreality about it all,\" the BBC's Evan Davis gently suggested to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/30/davidcameron.creditcrunch\">David Cameron</a> when they discussed the deepening economic crisis and the Tory conference on the radio this morning. </p> <p>Cameron's unscheduled intervention on the conference podium underlines how much is at stake for the Tories too.</p> <p>For the party of free markets and deregulation the terms of trade are changing fast and Cameron's team are running hard to catch up with the pace of events and distance themselves from where they were until quite recently. But at least they're trying.</p> <p>Among party activists in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">Birmingham</a>, in the corridors, bars and receptions plenty of representatives \u2013 never delegates \u2013 are still with the Republican obstructionists in the US Congress \u2013 convinced that government interventions across the world are preventing the self-correction which unfettered markets would deliver unaided to the stricken banking system.</p> <p>\"We shouldn't be bailing out the banks, let them pay for their own mistakes,\" a self-styled fundraiser for the party, living in a rich corner of London, told me at the Spectator party last night. \"We're way past that stage now,\" I ventured.</p> <p>A few feet closer to the exit I encountered another woman, also 30-ish, who was vague about what she does for a living (banker?) but agreed with me. \"There's an enormous truck bearing down on us all,\" she said. \"People haven't got it yet.\"</p> <p>Agreed on that, I don't think I've quite got it yet either. But I'm going through all my financial affairs in my head in spare moments, starting to think \"can I afford that any more?\" You probably are too. If not, get started.</p> <p>I thought <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a> rose to the occasion well enough in his speech to the conference yesterday. Yes, there was plenty in it to criticise, as the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/30/wallstreet.marketturmoil1\">Guardian's leader</a> suggests today. </p> <p>\"The cupboard is bare,\" as he said. But the conference juggernaut is still making spending pledges and Osborne himself promised a council tax freeze \u2013 the biggest applause line of the day, incidentally.</p> <p>He managed to get rid of his teenage smirk, the one he usually lets slips every time he delivers a good zinger, and sounded both serious, scornful \u2013 of Gordon Brown and the City \u2013 as well as suitably austere. There was a touch of Iain Macleod, the Tory highbrow, professional gambler and bridge player, darling of the party left, who died at No 11 three weeks after becoming chancellor in 1970.</p> <p>Macleod was a fine orator and when Osborne inverted the prime minister's novice joke I thought of him. Did you catch it? \"Well, Mr Brown, when it comes to listening, learning and understanding, you know I believe in apprenticeships. But this is no time for a novice.\"</p> <p>All that said, Brown and Alistair Darling are now looking as if they are on top of events much more than they did as Northern Rock shattered this time last year. The Bradford &amp; Bingley collapse was much better handled, so far as I can yet see. </p> <p>And which governing party presided over deregulation and the demutualisation of solid, unflashy building societies? Labour was carried along by the tide, further than it should have been, but Margaret Thatcher \u2013 voted the party's greatest hero in last night's Guardian conference debate - put it all in train.</p> <p>That may be why hardcore Republican congressmen wrecked the Paulson plan as semi-socialist and why Barack Obama seems \u2013 seems - to be pulling ahead again in the presidential race. They don't get the need to stop the rot, stop the collapse of financial institutions around the world, which are basically sound and should not fall. It's all about confidence.</p> <p>But then, the US Congress failed most of its major tests in the 20th century: the League of Nations (1919-20); the Wall St slump of 1929-31; collective security before Pearl Harbour (1941); Vietnam (1963-75) and the debt-crazed, tax-slashing deregulation of the past 20 years. </p> <p>Neither party comes out well, but the Republicans, pandering to the dafter prejudices of public opinion, comes out worse. Why change the bad habits of one century just because a new one rolls up?</p> <p>The most sombre conversation I heard last night was between half a dozen senior Tories, ex-ministers, even a former cabinet minister. They too thought it is now getting very serious, very fast. </p> <p>\"When we get into power we will have to cut public spending sharply as Margaret Thatcher did in 1979,\" said one. \" Does David Cameron have the nerve to do it. Have he and George Osborne got it yet?\" </p> <p>\"And will Labour poison the well? Will Brown spend and spend, knowing he's going to lose. All that stuff about free childcare for two-year-olds, he knows he can't do it now,\" said another.</p> <p>Scary talk. Meanwhile, in distant Austria the far right has just taken 29% of the vote. Tin helmets on.</p> <p><strong>11.45am footnote:</strong> Cameron has just addressed the conference, implicitly confirming last night's rumours that they thought of cancelling the remaining stages by bringing his closing speech forward by 24 hours to this morning.</p> <p>Instead, still struggling to catch up with events, he made a short holding statement which contained two key points. </p> <p>One was telling his party activists that, despite widespread anger with the financial sector, today is not the \"day of reckoning.\" Today is the day for ensuring safety, security and the protection for the jobs and savings of ordinary citizens, put at risk by the meltdown. </p> <p>\"We must not bury the free enterprise system, but reform it, he said. Tory instincts are sound here because Tories understand the system - \"We understand its strengths and its weaknesses.\" That's a further attempt to put distance between the party and its past.</p> <p>Cleverly I thought, Cameron also extended a bipartisan hand to the government \u2013 \"let us not allow the political wrangling that took place in America to happen here in our own country.\" Prolonged applause.</p> <p>In practical terms he wants a tightening of bank regulation (who should have the power, the Bank of England, as he wishes, or the FSA ?); legislation, also next week, to strengthen protection of savings; and a global effort to tweak the \"making to market\" mechanism which is now driving down credit worthiness in a destructive way.</p> <p>All fair enough, and the devil is in the detail. But it struck me as a well-judged intervention.</p>",
  "<p>The Brazilian government faces criminal charges after a report found that the Amazon <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/forests\">rainforest</a> is being deforested three times faster than last year as rising food prices encourages more illegal logging.</p> <p>A study by <a href=\"http://www.inpe.br/\">Brazil's National Institute for Space Research </a>found that destruction of the Amazon had increased 228% in August compared with the same month a year ago.</p> <p>Carlos Minc, the Brazilian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment\">environment</a> minister, said the upcoming national elections were partly to blame, with mayors in the Amazon region ignoring illegal loggers in the hope of gaining votes locally.</p> <p>Environmental campaigners blamed the global spike in food prices for pushing soy farmers and cattle ranchers to clear more land for crops and grazing.</p> <p>\"The tendency of deforestation rising is deeply related to the fact that food prices are going up,\" said Paulo Adario, who coordinates Greenpeace's Amazon campaign. \"When you have elections, the appetite of authorities to enforce laws is reduced.

The government will also create an environmental police force with 3,000 heavily armed and specially trained officers to help combat illegal deforestion.</p> <p>The institute, which uses satellite imagery to track down illegal logging, said the destruction was likely to be worse than figures show since no information was available for 26% of the Amazon because of cloud cover in August.</p> <p>Greenpeace has accused Incra officials of illegally handing over rainforest to logging companies and creating fake settlements to skirt environmental regulations.</p> <p>Minc said Incra was responsible for destroying 220,150 hectares (544,000 acres) of the world's largest rainforest in the past three years.</p> <p>The news that Incra topped the list of violators is likely to fuel the argument of large landowners that poor peasants are to blame for the destruction of the Amazon.

  "<p>To read the headlines, you'd think the end of the world was nigh. The collapse of the $700bn US bail-out of the global financial system attracts dire warnings across the UK papers. We are \"Staring into the abyss\" (Telegraph) and facing a \"World of Pain\" (Mirror) after the \"Meltdown on Wall Street\" (Mail) and the <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/money/article1749345.ece\">\"Blackest Monday\"</a> (Sun).</p> <p>According to the Times, the world faces a new phase in the financial crisis now that plans for the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4848747.ece\">\"biggest rescue of Wall Street since the Great Depression lies in tatters\"</a>. The financial system is lurching closer to a \"catastrophic breakdown\" after Wall Street suffered one of the worst days in its history.<br> The paper's economics commentator, Anatole Kalestky, offers some hope: \"In one form or another, the package will surely be passed in the next few days.\" The alternative, he writes, would be the failure of every leading bank in America and, for the rest of the world - particularly Britain - the nationalisation of all leading banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. The US broadsheets use more measured headlines than their UK counterparts, but their analysis is no less severe. The Washington Post says the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/29/AR2008092900623.html\">\"bipartisan rebellion\"</a> that killed the rescue plan sent \"global stock prices plunging, prompting fierce recriminations on the presidential campaign trail and dealing President Bush his worst legislative defeat\". The paper says that although Democratic and Republican leaders have vowed to go back into negotiations to devise compromise legislation, no talks have been scheduled. </p> <p>Twice as many Democrats as Republicans backed the plan in last night's vote in the House of Representatives, the New York Times reports. It says some Republicans cited ideological objections to government intervention while liberal Democrats said they were of no mind to race to aid Wall Street tycoons. </p> <p>But the fundamental reason for the defeat was \"an outpouring of opposition from deeply hostile constituents just five weeks before every seat in the House was up for election\". <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/business/30cong.html\">\"House members in potentially tough races and those seeking Senate seats fled from the plan in droves,\"</a> the paper says. </p> <p>New York's Daily News lists the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2008/09/29/2008-09-29_president_bush_nancy_pelosi_among_bigges-1.html\">biggest losers</a> from the blocked bail-out, including Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, and retired people, who are advised to use their pension statements for kindling. </p> <p>Time magazine says the origins of the bail-out defeat go back a long way. The vote itself was a <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1845655,00.html\">\"popular revolt\"</a> against Bush and almost every other US political leader and is the \"culmination of a historic sense of betrayal that Americans have long felt for their representatives in Washington\".</p> <p>At a time when the US is going through such huge turmoil, the Los Angeles Times finds time to highlight the woes of the hundreds of UK investment bankers who are suddenly out of work. The cafes of Canary Wharf have been transformed into <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fg-britecon30-2008sep30,0,5189956.story\">\"career triage centres\"</a>, the paper's reporter in London says, while a meeting for would-be teachers attracted 80 people. \"Teaching does offer security,\" the man from the teacher training unit helpfully pointed out.</p> <p>Those investment bankers could be joined in the unemployment lines by staff from the newly nationalised Bradford &amp; Bingley.

  "<p>Iain Duncan Smith today accused the political class of being too busy chasing short-term headlines to do what it takes to prevent society \"losing a generation to the streets\".</p> <p>The former Tory leader gave a chastening account of the effects of dysfunctional backgrounds on young peoples' lives as he insisted that the mission to save the next generation was \"almost above party politics\" and ought to be ingrained in everyone's political DNA.</p> <p>Citing a swathe of dismal social statistics, such as high suicide rates and low educational attainments in children from difficult family backgrounds, Duncan Smith said: \"We as a political class have created this. We have ghettoised and locked the problem away from our vision.\"</p> <p>Duncan Smith, who set up the Centre for Social Justice thinktank after stepping down as leader, raised the high rate of workless households with single parents, which meant that somewhere was the other, absent parent: \"What an absurd situation we have got ourselves in.\"</p> <p>His sharpest criticism was of the provision of children in care, who he said faced worst educational outcomes and bleaker social outcomes than those left to flounder within broken homes. \"If the state was a family in Britain, we would have our children taken off us because they are so dysfunctional. What a crying shame.\"</p> <p>Politicians were too easily distracted by the lure of short-term headlines to take the necessary measures for the long-term good, he warned.</p> <p>\"As a party we need as politicians to be driven by you,\" he said. \"I do not accept that as politicians we will do the job because we will follow sometimes what the short-term headlines tell us.\"</p> <p>The Conservatives should hold their party to account to ensure its policies would contribute to fixing the endemic social problems, he said.</p> <p>\"We need you to ask us again and again: what will this do to save the next generation? How will this help improve the quality of their lives? This is a mission that will last longer than the global crisis.\"</p> <p>He insisted that David Cameron, who has made fixing the \"broken society\" a central theme of his political vision, was the right man to lead the mission. </p> <p>\"It requires someone like David Cameron to step up to the plate. This is his priority. He wants to make it a priority by saying that saving the next generation is critical.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Jeremy Batstone-Carr</strong>, analyst at <strong>Charles Stanley</strong>, said: \"First and foremost, we suspect that all may not be lost. It is likely that neither side will wish to claim victory and that the result is likely to bring the Bill back to the House, with further amendments, for another vote. Note that a relatively small number of dissenters are required to deliver the mere 50% majority necessary to ensure the Bill's passage. Therefore, investors should continue to believe that, despite the high level invective a rescue package will be delivered.</p> <p>\"Investors should note that despite the equity market's violent reaction to the news from Congress, the crisis in the financial markets has never really been about equities. The most strenuous efforts should continue to be made to unfreeze the money markets, the point at which Wall St. and Main St. intersect. Failure to achieve a breakthrough would inevitably give rise to considerably weaker US and global growth than had hitherto been forecast and most likely increase the risk of a long and deep recession as the deleveraging process continues unchecked.\"</p> <p><strong>Paul Ashworth</strong>, senior US economist at<strong> Capital Economics</strong>, said: \"You couldn't make this stuff up if you tried. The rejection by the House of Representatives of the supposedly agreed plan to allow the Treasury to buy up to $700bn of distressed mortgage-backed securities has unsurprisingly sent the stock markets into another tailspin. They forgot the first rule of policy making in a crisis: above all do no harm. Even if a new amended plan can be agreed, we doubt it will be in place until next week at the earliest. Admittedly, we weren't particularly big fans of the Treasury's TARP in the first place, because addressing the lack of liquidity in the market for mortgage-backed securities wouldn't have helped with solving the real problem, which is the destruction of bank capital due to asset write-downs and mounting loan defaults. </p> <p>\"Nevertheless, the program could have helped to reduce some of the stresses in the securities market and improved the functioning of the interbank funding market. As President Bush said after the House vote, 'we've got a big problem'. Too right.\"</p> <p><strong>Bernd Weidensteiner</strong>, analyst at <strong>Commerzbank</strong>, said: \"A number of possible options are now being discussed. A revised version of the package might be put to the House again for approval, and to up the pressure on the house, the Senate might be asked to vote first. The package would almost certainly be approved there. On the other hand, negotiations might start again from scratch, which would mean a very tight schedule for all concerned. On 4 November, after all, the country goes to the polls to elect a new president, House and a third of the Senate. It is equally possible, therefore, that no package will be approved before the new administration takes office in January.</p> <p>\"Until the corresponding legislation is passed, the Fed and the Treasury secretary will have to make do with whatever means are available. The FDIC will proceed with its endeavours to oversee consolidation in the banking sector. The Treasury secretary can perhaps have recourse to the Exchange Stabilisation Fund to come to the aid of faltering banks. However, the Fed will have to bear the brunt of battling the crisis, and will use all the means currently at its disposable \u2013 and possibly additional instruments \u2013 to keep the money market from the grip of paralysis.\"</p> <p><strong>Alex Potter</strong> at <strong>Collins Stewart</strong> said: \"Firstly, the plan is likely to be renegotiated over the rest of this week (though with a break for Jewish New Year) with a view to another vote in a week. Most commentators appear to be expecting a watered-down bill second time around. Secondly, the margin of defeat (225-208) was relatively small, so some small concessions would appear likely to secure the bill. </p> <p>\"The US government is clearly hoping that, with cleaner balance sheets, liquidity will return to the US banks and the wholesale money markets will become functional again. There would clearly be collateral benefits to the UK &amp; Europe, in our view. However, we do feel that liquidity will more likely be tempted back when underlying asset prices (mainly houses) stabilise and this seems a distant prospect yet. The only alternative is a solution that includes previous main liquidity providers not just central banks. This would include Mid-Eastern petrodollar funds, sovereign wealth funds, state investment bodies, Chinese &amp; Indian governments and the Japanese pension system. This will also take time.\"</p>",
  "<p>The schools minister, Lord Adonis, has set out his ambitions for a national network of cadet forces, to be shared between the independent and state sectors. </p> <p>Introducing cadet forces to disadvantaged areas of the country, starting in the capital, would help improve pupils' confidence and self-reliance, he told the annual meeting of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), which represents 250 private schools, today. </p> <p>He also announced new plans to partner every London state school with a university under the London Challenge scheme, which supports under-performing schools. He said every school in the country could ultimately follow this model.</p> <p>Combined Cadet Forces (CCF) is the volunteer youth wing of the armed forces. Pupils aged between 13 and 18 are trained in army, navy and air force skills including marching, shooting and cooking army rations. </p> <p>Adonis said: \"Cadets can be a real force for good in our schools. The experience provides not only fun, healthy activities for young people but they also encourage valuable personal attributes, help to build skills and, using military themes based upon the culture and ethos of the single services, foster confidence, self reliance, initiative, resourcefulness, loyalty and a sense of service to others. </p> <p>\"This initiative is another example of the emerging spirit of cooperation between state and independent schools, which we must continue to foster and encourage.\"</p> <p>Aldenham school in Hertfordshire, City of London school, Whitgift school in Croydon and Highgate Boys in north London will be among the first independent schools to set up schemes. </p> <p>The cadet plan is starting with six London private schools in multiple partnerships with state schools. It follows months of negotiations between the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Ministry of Defence. </p> <p>Adonis has insisted \u2013 in the face of criticisms from teachers' unions over the plans \u2013 that arguments against cadet forces in schools are \"spurious\".</p> <p>Unions have accused the MoD of recruiting in schools and some have expressed fears about the connotations of children who may be growing up in violent neighbourhoods having access to weapons. </p> <p>Peter Lonsdale, a long-standing adult CCF volunteer, has been appointed a \"cadet ambassador\" to help set up the schemes.

There are people who are against the army for religious, philosophical or political reasons. But from my perspective, shooting is an Olympic sport and taught properly it can encourage respect and self-control. Pupils have to pass a test, which can take four months before they are allowed access to weaponry. I would prefer they learn respect for weapons in a safe environment than behind the bike shed.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco\">Tesco</a> today met City expectations with a 10% rise in first-half profits and said UK like-for-like sales picked up over the summer, even though non-food sales slowed sharply.</p> <p>The supermarket group's UK like-for-like sales climbed 6.7% in the 26 weeks to August 23, and 3.7% excluding petrol. The first quarter showed growth of 3.5%, accelerating to 4% in the second. </p> <p>Britain's biggest retailer raised its interim dividend by 11.6% to 3.57p a share. The shares climbed 7.1p to 377p this morning, a rise of 1.9%.</p> <p>Chief executive Sir Terry Leahy said consumers were \"hard pressed\" but that some analysts were exaggerating by saying retail conditions were the worst for 30 years.</p> <p>\"Inflation has passed its peak... and that will leave room for interest rate cuts which I think will be welcomed,\" Leahy said. \"Also, though, it's important that we get banks back doing their job, which is to provide liquidity for the real economy and lending at sensible prices.\"</p> <p>Tesco has been losing ground to discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, which are the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/supermarkets\">fastest-growing supermarket chains</a> in Britain. But it has fought back by launching a range of 400 cheaper, Market Value-branded products, promising to turn itself into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/26/consumeraffairs.familyfinance\">Britain's biggest discounter</a>.</p> <p>Finance director Andrew Higginson admitted that Tesco had been losaing \"a little\" market share to the discount chains, but stressed that even though they are \"still very much in the margins, we have always taken them very seriously. We compete against them very strongly in central Europe.\"</p> <p>Tesco said customers were \"trading down in some product categories to help relieve stretched household budgets\", but stressed food sales remained solid. Sales of its upmarket range \"Tesco's finest\" are flat. </p> <p>\"Customers are obviously cautious and they are nervous,\" said Higginson, adding that Tesco had responded by cutting prices. \"Inflation in the food area is coming right down now,\" he said, with a better outlook for crops than last year.</p> <p>More than 40% of British shoppers have switched to cheaper brands, according to a recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/26/consumeraffairs.familyfinance\">report by the market research group Mintel</a>.</p> <p>Tesco's non-food sales were up 4% during the six-monthperiod, half the 8% rate seen in the second half of last year, but the retailer insisted it had still taken market share. While clothes sales were hit by the poor weather and were flat on last year, electricals and toys did well. </p> <p>\"People are also buying more vegetable plants,\" said Lucy Neville-Rolfe, Tesco's executive director of corporate and legal affairs, another sign that consumers were desperately trying to lower their weekly shopping bills. She chairs the recently acquired Dobbies chain, which Tesco wants to expand into a national network of garden centres.</p> <p>Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan said: \"This sales performance is good, not great, but we would expect Tesco to outperform its quoted competitors in the UK over the next 12 months in terms of both sales and margins. As we enter the worst retail environment in the UK for over 30 years, Tesco is well placed but we would expect its UK profits to suffer, if not by as much as its competitors.\"</p> <p>The supermarket group, which serves more than 20 million British shoppers a week, reported a profit before tax and one-off items of \u00a31.453bn for the first half. Sales climbed 14% to \u00a328.1bn, driven by a 27% jump in international sales. </p> <p>\"Tesco is at its best in tough markets, responding to the changing needs of customers, and that's why we have been able to make good progress this year, despite facing into powerful economic headwinds and carrying planned start-up losses in the US,\" said Leahy. </p> <p>In the US, where Tesco launched the now 80-strong Fresh &amp; Easy chain \u2014 mainly in southern California \u2014 nine months ago, sales are running at an average $11 per square foot a week, above the American industry average. The division made a \u00a360m loss, with sales of \u00a376m, but Tesco hopes to break even by the end of the next full financial year.</p>",
  "<p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the United States' financial system \u2013 indeed, global finance \u2013 is in a mess. And now, with the US House of Representatives having rejected the Bush administration's proposed $700bn bail-out plan, it is also obvious that there is no consensus on how to fix it.</p> <p>The problems in the US economy and financial system have been apparent for years. But that didn't prevent America's leaders from turning to the same people who helped create the mess, who didn't see the problems until they brought us to the brink of another Great Depression, and who have been veering from one bail-out to another, to rescue us.</p> <p>As global <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">markets plummet</a>, the rescue plan will almost certainly be put to another vote in Congress. They may rescue Wall Street, but what about the economy? What about taxpayers, already beleaguered by unprecedented deficits, and with bills still to pay for decaying infrastructure and two wars? In such circumstances, can any bail-out plan work?</p> <p>To be sure, the rescue plan that was just defeated was far better than what the Bush administration originally proposed. But its basic approach remained critically flawed. First, it relied \u2013 once again \u2013 on trickle-down economics: somehow, throwing enough money at Wall Street would trickle down to Main Street, helping ordinary workers and homeowners. Trickle-down economics almost never works, and it is no more likely to work this time.</p> <p>Moreover, the plan assumed that the fundamental problem was one of confidence. That is no doubt part of the problem; but the underlying problem is that financial markets made some very bad loans. There was a housing bubble, and loans were made on the basis of inflated prices.</p> <p>That bubble has burst. House prices probably will fall further, so there will be more foreclosures, and no amount of talking up the market is going to change that. The bad loans, in turn, have created massive holes in banks' balance sheets, which have to be repaired. Any government bail-out that pays fair value for these assets will do nothing to repair that hole. On the contrary, it would be like providing massive blood transfusions to a patient suffering from vast internal hemorrhaging.</p> <p>Even if a bail-out plan were implemented quickly \u2013 which appears increasingly unlikely \u2013 there would be some credit contraction. The US economy has been sustained by a consumption boom fueled by excessive borrowing, and that will be curtailed. States and localities are cutting back expenditures. Household balance sheets are weaker. An economic slowdown will exacerbate all our financial problems.</p> <p>We could do more with less money. The holes in financial institutions' balance sheets should be filled in a transparent way. The Scandinavian countries showed the way two decades ago. <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122256922970483051.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">Warren Buffet</a> showed another way, in providing equity to Goldman Sachs. By issuing preferred shares with warrants (options), one reduces the public's downside risk and ensures that they participate in some of the upside potential.</p> <p>This approach is not only proven, but it also provides both the incentives and wherewithal needed for lending to resume. It avoids the hopeless task of trying to value millions of complex mortgages and the even more complex financial products in which they are embedded, and it deals with the \"lemons\" problem \u2013 the government gets stuck with the worst or most overpriced assets. Finally, it can be done far more quickly.</p> <p>At the same time, several steps can be taken to reduce foreclosures. First, housing can be made more affordable for poor and middle-income Americans by converting the mortgage deduction into a cashable tax credit. The government effectively pays 50% of the mortgage interest and real estate taxes for upper-income Americans, yet does nothing for the poor. Second, bankruptcy reform is needed to allow homeowners to write down the value of their homes and stay in their houses. Third, government could assume part of a mortgage, taking advantage of its lower borrowing costs.</p> <p>By contrast, US treasury secretary <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2008/03/29/paulson-finance-reform-biz-wallst-cx_lm_0329paulson.html\">Henry Paulson's approach</a> is another example of the kind of shell games that got America into its mess. Investment banks and credit rating agencies believed in financial alchemy \u2013 the notion that significant value could be created by slicing and dicing securities. The new view is that real value can be created by un-slicing and un-dicing \u2013 pulling these assets out of the financial system and turning them over to the government. But that requires overpaying for the assets, benefiting only the banks.</p> <p>In the end, there is a high likelihood that if such a plan is ultimately adopted, American taxpayers will be left on the hook. In environmental economics, there is a basic principle, called \"the polluter pays principle.\" It is a matter of both equity and efficiency. Wall Street has polluted the economy with toxic mortgages. It should pay for the cleanup.</p> <p>There is a growing consensus among economists that any bail-out based on Paulson's plan won't work. If so, the huge increase in the national debt and the realisation that even $700bn is not enough to rescue the US economy will erode confidence further and aggravate its weakness.</p> <p>But it is impossible for politicians to do nothing in such a crisis. So we may have to pray that an agreement crafted with the toxic mix of special interests, misguided economics, and right-wing ideologies that produced the crisis can somehow produce a rescue plan that works \u2013 or whose failure doesn't do too much damage.</p> <p>Getting things right \u2013 including a new regulatory system that reduces the likelihood that such a crisis will recur \u2013 is one of the many tasks to be left to the next administration. </p> <p>In cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",
  "<p>The British economy failed to grow at all in the second quarter of the year, newly updated data confirmed today, but the balance of payments deficit blew out to nearly \u00a311bn.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics left its gross domestic product estimate steady at zero, having revised it down from 0.2% a month ago. It revised up, however, its estimate of annual growth to 1.5% from 1.4% as a result of extensive back revisions to previous data that it makes once a year in the so-called \"Blue Book\".</p> <p>Most economists, though, think the economy has contracted in the current three months and will do so again in the final quarter of the year, meeting the technical definition of a recession.</p> <p>\"We now expect GDP to contract by 0.2% in 2009, after growing by just 1.1% in 2008. Furthermore, the risk of a deeper and longer recession is currently rising markedly due to the heightened financial sector problems and accompanying tighter credit conditions,\" said Howard Archer at Global Insight.</p> <p>Paul Dales, economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Perhaps most worrying was that the saving rate remained at an incredibly low level. Admittedly, it rose from a revised -1.1% in Q1 to +0.4%, but this was still the second lowest reading on record and shows just how stretched households' finances are. </p> <p>\"With real incomes falling, house prices declining and unemployment rising it can't be long before households start to forego spending for saving to a more significant degree.\"</p> <p>The ONS said the current account deficit widened to \u00a311bn in the April to June period from \u00a35.5 bn in the first quarter of the year - more evidence, according to Dales, of the unbalanced nature of the British economy.</p> <p>\"We continue to think that the UK economy is poised for a recession and a prolonged period of weak activity as the excesses of the last decade unwind dramatically.\"</p>",

  "<p>What do the far left and Islamists have in common? Not a lot, you may say, but you would be wrong. Despite being ideologically at the extremes of the political spectrum, they in fact share one worrying trait. </p> <p>The old rule that \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\" seems to be shaping the relationship between the hard left and Islamists in Britain today. By having a common foe in western capitalism, which they conveniently blame for all of the world's ills, they have developed a marriage of convenience against the odds.</p> <p>This alliance can also be seen on the international stage as Hugo Ch\u00e1vez <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6265190.stm\">holds hands</a> with Iran's Ahmedinejad while our own Ken Livingstone <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5168104.stm\">hugs</a> Yusuf al-Qaradawi. It was also evident at anti-Iraq war rallies where <a href=\"http://www.cnduk.org/\">CND</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.swp.org.uk/\">Socialist Workers Party</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respect_%E2%80%93_The_Unity_Coalition\">Respect</a> shared platforms with the likes of the <a href=\"http://www.mabonline.net/\">Muslim Association of Britain</a> (MAB) and the <a href=\"http://www.bminitiative.net/\">British Muslim Initiative</a> which are schismatic offshoots of radical Islamism. </p> <p>Azzam Tamimi (spokesman for MAB) when asked by BBC Hardtalk's Tim Sebastian if he was prepared to blow himself up in Palestine, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/3985403.stm\">replied</a>: \"If I can go to Palestine and sacrifice myself I would do it. Why not?\" </p> <p>Now don't get me wrong \u2013 I'm all for people of different backgrounds coming together and working in harmony. But it worries me slightly when the only thing that's really binding these divergent factions is not their love for all humanity or their desire to see a totalitarian state, but their common hatred of the west which can be called \"westophobia\". There, I've used it, the one word that can actually sum up all the various groupings that are ideologically driven to view the west and western capitalism as \"the enemy\". </p> <p>Westophobia can be defined as a form of prejudice against the west, and hatred of the west, its values and peoples. This form of prejudice is commonly found in the Arab world and increasingly in today's Kremlin, not to mention amongst Islamists and the hard left. Symptomatic of this prejudice is a mindset that blames world poverty, disease, internal conflicts and in some cases even natural disasters on western foreign policy or intervention. </p> <p>This is not to say that any opposition to western foreign policy, including the Iraq war or silence on Israeli aggression, should be deemed westophobic \u2013 just as support for western policy should not open one up to \"neocon\" or \"Zionist\" name-calling. I am referring to those instances where the blame game takes on a nihilistic and exaggerated element, often motivated by ideological opposition to western capitalism. </p> <p>In many cases such an attitude can appear to provide a political justification for violence. For example, on July 8 2005, Robert Fisk wrote an <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0708-25.htm\">article</a> in which he claimed: \"The Spanish paid the price for their support for Bush \u2013 and Spain's subsequent retreat from Iraq proved that the Madrid bombings achieved their objectives \u2013 while the Australians were made to suffer in Bali.\"</p> <p>He went on say: \"[What] we are confronting here is a specific, direct, centralised attack on London as a result of a 'war on terror' that Blair has locked us into.\"</p> <p>What such commentators fail to understand is that terrorists inspired by al-Qaida are not reactionary; rather they are pro-active and have a homegrown agenda, one not just of defence but one of conquest, destruction and subjugation. </p> <p>In Islamist thought the west is viewed as the very embodiment of evil itself, the great satan to be opposed and fought at all costs in the struggle of good versus evil. The west is presented as one great unified body whose sole purpose is to destroy Islam and humiliate Muslims. According to the former global leader of the extremist Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, the late Abdul Qadeem Zalloom: \"... when the discerning and sincere people say that the British are the head of kufr [unbelief] among all the other kufr states, they mean exactly that, for they are indeed the head of kufr and they are the arch-enemies of Islam. The Muslims should indeed harbour hatred for the British and a yearning for revenge over them ...\" (<a href=\"http://www.barizmedia.com/bookdetails/How_The_Khilafah_was_Destroyed.asp\">How the Khilafah was Destroyed</a>, page 186). </p> <p>Perhaps the greatest embodiment of this unique westophobia-inspired relationship is the Respect coalition which is an eclectic cocktail of Islamists and Leninists. This is a unique party indeed, in that it throws together secular and theocratic advocates of totalitarianism. The hard left's and the Islamists' struggle against the west is coupled with the Soviet nostalgia of the former and the latter's caliphate mythology. </p> <p>Can these two groupings really work on a common agenda? Well, for a start they both promote bizarre James Bond-villianesque conspiracy theories, and a westophobic world view, but their visions of the future are quite different. For how long will they continue to tolerate each others' views? How do people who believe that homosexuals should be thrown off high buildings build coalitions with those who promote gay rights? How do people who believe in strict gender segregation and face veils work with people who support women's lib? These schisms are sometimes apparent when gay leftists get too close to conservative Islamists and they yell \"Islamophobe\" and \"homophobe\" at one another. Rarely do they concede that they bond on another phobia: westophobia.</p>",

As Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, director of the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund, put it in July: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/20/usa.barackobama\">We made up our minds long ago: our president is Barack Obama.</a>\" </p> <p>Certainly, opinion polls seem to support this assessment. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/2049446/Barack-Obama-beats-John-McCain-in-European-vote-US-election-2008.html\">A survey conducted in May 2008</a> in five European states (Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia) found Obama to be well ahead of John McCain in every case. A <a href=\"http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/node/9326\">subsequent poll</a> in France, Germany and the UK on the eve of his July visit to Europe showed that his lead over his rival had increased in all three countries. And while crowds are notoriously fickle, the astonishing pictures of an adoring multitude at the rally for Obama at the Victory Column in Berlin on July 24 spoke a thousand words. This was the people's choice.</p> <p>But who exactly were they choosing and why?</p> <p>Just prior to Obama's clamorous reception in Berlin, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/21/barackobama.uselections2008\">Gary Younge remarked</a>: \"In the past six months, it has become patently clear people see in him whatever they want to see.\" This has been clear to Obama himself for much longer. \"I am new enough on the national political scene,\" he wrote in 2006 \"that I serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views\" (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/books/17kaku.html\">The Audacity of Hope</a>, page 11). Since hitting the presidential campaign trail in February 2007, however, the screen has become less blank as Obama has set out his political vision in a series of stump speeches.</p> <p>\"America must lead\": this was the keynote of his address at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, and it is one that he has sounded over and again in subsequent speeches on foreign policy. Just nine days before his appearance in Berlin, in a speech in Washington DC on July 15, he again invoked \"the tradition of American leadership on behalf of the global good\" and announced: \"From the moment I take office, I will let it be known that the United States of America is ready to lead again.\"</p> <p>But he did not make this known in Berlin. Not once in his speech to the 200,000 did he mention American leadership. Instead, he peppered the text with words like \"partnership\", \"sharing\" and \"cooperation\". \"My country must stand with yours and with Europe,\" he said, seeming to imply equality and parity. Whereas his speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs was called \"The American Moment\", the one in Berlin was \"A World that Stands as One\". The difference in title is telling.</p> <p>So, on the question of America's role beyond its borders, it might look as if there are two candidates with one name. And if Obama is elected in November, the choice of the American people could be different from the one that wowed Berlin. And yet, the two Obamas are not necessarily irreconcilable. There is a way of seeing and hearing him that brings the two figures into alignment.</p> <p>To begin with, we must not automatically equate American leadership with American hegemony. In view of America's recent record abroad, it is difficult for us Europeans to keep these two notions apart. But not only is there a distinction analytically, it could make all the difference politically. That is to say, Obama might be trading on this distinction when addressing his domestic audience. </p> <p>I stress \"domestic\". He knows that across the world people in general are fed up with America's view of itself as head of the herd, as leading the charge for \"freedom and justice\"; fed up because suspicious of the underlying motives and appalled by the results. Abroad, the image of America as a beacon to the world is, to say the least, tarnished. You might say, therefore, that Obama had the good taste not to subject his audience in Europe to this particular brand of inspirational rhetoric.</p> <p>But at home, America is the City on a Hill. This is not just any image. It is the self-image of the republic. In 1630, long before the US was a twinkle in Jefferson's eye, John Winthrop, the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, gave a sermon to his congregation of English emigrants: \"[W]e must consider that we shall be as a City Upon a Hill, the eyes of all people are upon us.\" Winthrop was a Puritan and by \"we\", he meant New England. But over time, his radiant simile, which was equally congenial to the enlightenment idea of America as a beacon of liberty, became the indispensable image of \"the indispensable nation\" as Madeleine Albright put it. When Obama says to his fellow Americans \"we must lead the world, by deed and example\", he is holding up the American torch, reminding them what America, in its own eyes, is.</p> <p>But lead the world in what direction? That is the open question. With which deeds and by what manner of example? When these crucial blanks are filled in, the gap between \"the two Obamas\" seems to shrink. Consider an excerpt from his Chicago speech. Affirming his belief that \"the American people will be ready to lead again\", he elucidates: \"They will be ready to show the world that we are not a country that ships prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far-off countries. That we are not a country that runs prisons which took people away without ever telling them why they are there or what they are charged with. That we are not a country which preaches compassion and justice to others while we allow bodies to float down the streets of a major American city.\" His call to leadership is a summons to America to put its own house in order.</p> <p>As regards other nations, Obama puts forward the proposition - radical in relation to the status quo of American foreign policy - that putting their houses in order might be more their own business than America's. \"[W]e should be sceptical,\" he writes, \"of those who believe we can single-handedly liberate other people from tyranny.\" He argues that \"when we seek to impose democracy with the barrel of a gun, funnel money to parties whose economic policies are deemed friendlier to Washington, or fall under the sway of exiles like Chalabi\" this retards the possibility that \"genuine, homegrown democracy will ever emerge\" (The Audacity of Hope, pages 316-7). </p> <p>Covering the Berlin rally, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/25/barackobama.germany\">Jonathan Freedland reported</a> that \"the loudest applause came when Obama, however subtly, offered himself as the coming antidote to all that the Germans, Europeans - and most non-Americans - have disliked about the Bush era.\" When Obama, offering himself to the electorate at home, acknowledges that America is \"less respected than at any time in recent history\"; lambasts eight years of a foreign policy \"that lectures without listening\"; calls for \"a new era of international cooperation\"; and says it is better for America \"to act multilaterally rather than unilaterally\": then the gap between \"the two Obamas\" begins to look more rhetorical than real. </p> <p>On the other hand, if you trawl through his speeches you can find plenty of evidence to support a different conclusion. There are those who see Obama as a neocon wolf in Democratic sheep's clothing. I have also encountered the view that his oratory is sheer razzmatazz; that when the hot air dissipates all you are left with is a typical politician who is playing for high stakes. And perhaps Younge has a point: people still see in Obama what they want; even what they fear.</p> <p>Yet there is another possibility. When he addressed the rally in Berlin, he remarked: \"I know that I don't look like the Americans who've previously spoken in this great city\". Appearances are not necessarily deceptive. The possibility exists that Obama does signify a departure, both domestically and globally, from business as usual; that he offers \"change we can believe in\". As self-styled \"leader of the free world\", perhaps he would turn American leadership in another direction: away from American hegemony. It is hard to say - and too soon.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the November presidential election approaches, all we Europeans can do is watch with bated breath. Not only do we wonder how the American people will cast their vote, we also ask ourselves: if they choose Obama, whom will they have chosen?</p>"
