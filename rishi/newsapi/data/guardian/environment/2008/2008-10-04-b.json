  "<p>It is the ultimate entrepreneurs' face-off: The Apprentice versus Dragons' Den. At Cavendish Square in the heart of London's West End, the sale of a \u00a35.5m building owned by the hard-pressed Royal Bank of Scotland attracted 100 viewings, including James Caan and two other Dragons, and Sir Alan Sugar.</p> <p>How come? Well, West End real estate has not been far behind gold as a safe haven for those with cash. But the other reason is perhaps more pertinent and gives a clue to the way savvy business types operate: the Cavendish Square asking price was significantly reduced to encourage interest.</p> <p>Slapping a discounted asking price on a property is just about the only tactic that generates a viewing in the bombed-out property and house-building sector. With mortgage approvals down 95 per cent according to the latest Council of Mortgage Lenders figures, it emerged last week that Barratt, the beleaguered volume house-builder, is offering discounts of up to 43 per cent in group purchases of properties.</p> <p>Once a pillar of the unprecedented 15-year UK boom, property's calamitous fall threatens to bring the whole economic house down. Estate agents, property companies and house-builders are all in the firing line. </p> <p>Estate agent Hamptons International says house prices have fallen 20 per cent from their peak last year. Vacancy rates for City offices increased 46 per cent in the past year according to property consultant NB Real Estate, as tenants went out of business and new developments failed to fill up. City office rents have fallen 17 per cent from their peak and tens of thousands of jobs across the property and building sectors have been axed, with thousands more to come.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, Oakdene Homes lost 37 per cent of its value after the firm became the first quoted house-builder to breach its debt covenants. The builder, which focuses on the south east, is using a temporary bank lifeline. </p> <p>Many private developers have already breached bank terms and gone under and Crest Nicholson, the house-builder jointly owned by HBOS and Scottish tycoon Sir Tom Hunter, could be about to have covenant problems. Many of HBOS's property and house-building investments have fallen in value and are trading badly. Taylor Wimpey, the UK's biggest builder, is also at serious risk of breaching. Agreement on refinancing the firm hasn't been reached but banks are being 'supportive' and 'constructive', say those close to the situation. </p> <p>Of course, banks are reluctant to call in their money now because non-performing loans will make their disastrous balance sheets look even worse. Many suspect that vital decisions will be postponed until the next financial year.</p> <p>In the UK alone, banks have lent \u00a3232bn for commercial property purchase - an increase of more than 300 per cent in seven years. In many instances, the loans are now worth more than the properties. </p> <p>So long as landlords receive rents, banks will be happy. The problems will come if, as expected, there are a large number of tenant defaults in the next six months.</p> <p>The Irish banking system is particularly exposed to this scenario. One property tycoon active across the UK and Ireland says: 'Employees shelled out [the banks'] money because they were incentivised to do so. When I talked about how I was going to pay the bank back, they didn't give a monkey's. They didn't care. That was a breach of bank licence.'</p> <p>Some observers suggest Anglo Irish - a bank that lent vast sums on property deals in the UK and Ireland - has been trading close to insolvency. There are suggestions that Anglo Irish will be merged with another Irish institution and recapitalised by the government.</p> <p>Amid the carnage, there are plenty of cash-rich investors waiting for the crisis to worsen before Hoovering up strategic assets. Among them are Tony Pidgley, the self-made boss of quoted housebuilder Berkeley Group, who sold large land holdings in the north two years ago and is sitting on a cash pile. Gerald Ronson, the veteran property tycoon, and Jamie Ritblat, the son of British Land's Sir John Ritblat, are also cash-rich. Sovereign wealth funds, too, will buy bricks, mortar and land in the next few months.</p> <p>The trigger could be a sustained lowering of interest rates by central bankers, which would make property yields look relatively attractive. But that could be a way off. In the meantime, all the talk is about which tycoon or company is going 'pop'.</p> <p>Among the most high-profile companies facing severe difficulties is Foxtons, the estate agent based in the south east of England. With employees zipping through London's streets in racing-green Minis and working out of modern offices with giant plasma television screens, no other company epitomises the frenetic property bull market better.</p> <p>Founded in 1981 by Jon Hunt, the firm expanded rapidly, building a business by taking an aggressive stance on house price valuations and commissions. It was a formula that worked well. Profits poured in and growth seemed inexorable. For Hunt, a clipped 55-year-old, payday arrived in May 2007 when BC Partners, one of the country's most respected private equity firms, paid \u00a3360m for the 23-branch business. A large share of that went to Hunt, who, not surprisingly, then walked away.</p> <p>Even then, at the height of the boom, eyebrows were raised at the price BC had paid. Today, the deal looks like an albatross and may come to be regarded be regarded as the beginning of the end of private equity's debt-fuelled boom.</p> <p>Foxtons has to repay \u00a323m per month to meet its obligations. The business was stress-tested by BC prior to its acquisition but the scenario involved a fall in transactions of 30 per cent. Now that transactions have all but dried up, the business is in trouble, shedding staff and cutting advertising.</p> <p>Today, BC Partners is locked in talks with the bankers who funded the deal by putting up more than \u00a3250m. </p> <p>Whether Foxtons will survive the coming year is very much open to debate. The scant comfort for its backers is that they are far from being alone.</p>",
  "<p>'Who dares wins' is a maxim that holds good for investing in a bear market. But buyers beware: even experienced punters can lose their shirts. </p> <p>Private equity group TPG lost $1.35bn last month after foundering Washington Mutual, the savings and loans institute, was taken over by US regulators. In Britain, RAB Capital invested millions in Northern Rock after the bank hit the buffers only to lose it all following nationalisation.</p> <p>Calling the bottom of the market is a dangerous game - avoid falling knives, the experts love to tell us - but veteran British investor Anthony Bolton stepped out of the shadows last week to suggest that despite the stockmarket's rollercoaster ride, now might be a good time to buy.</p> <p>Bolton, who used to run Fidelity's hugely successful Special Situations Fund, disclosed that he had been putting some of his own money into the market at the height of the latest leg of the financial crisis. 'I have started to feel optimistic in the last few weeks,' he said. He reckons retailers and media companies are a steal at current prices if you are prepared to sit tight for a couple of years. Banks are more difficult, although he says most of the bad news is factored into current prices.</p> <p>In a falling market, most companies lose value, but some sectors decline less precipitously than others. Banks, retailers and housebuilders have crashed by as much as 90 per cent, no different from the level of falls recorded by technology companies when the dotcom bubble burst in 2000/01. </p> <p>But pharmaceuticals, utilities, tobacco and telecommunications have been less affected. British American Tobacco has bucked the trend: at nearly 900p, its shares are up fourfold since 2003. </p> <p>Cigarette and drugs companies are conventionally viewed as defensive plays during times of economic uncertainty, but the panic of recent weeks has seen investors turn to assets deemed even safer than cash - gold coins and bars. With the viability of the banking system being questioned, people are investing in the metal as the ultimate hedge against global financial meltdown.</p> <p>Mark Dampier, head of research at private stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, says: 'Our customers have been ringing up and expressing more concern about their cash than stocks and shares. They expect the market to go up and down, but they don't expect uncertainty linked to cash deposits at major high street banks. I can't tell you how many phone calls we have had about it. Quite astonishing.'</p> <p>Nevertheless, data show that retail investors have been deserting the stockmarket, with ISA sales recording a net outflow of \u00a3282m during August. Retail fund sales in July saw a net outflow of \u00a3511m. Funds under management are down 7 per cent in the past year at \u00a3427bn, according to the Investment Management Association.</p> <p>Dampier admits that in the current climate 'investment theories go out the window. It's pointless saying this or that share is cheap because, quite often, no one is listening.' But he points out that the lower the market gets, the higher the yield on dividend payouts: 'If the FTSE hovers between 4,800 and 5,000, the yield is higher than on a 10-year gilt; if it falls to 4,500, the yield is better than cash.'</p> <p>At Morgan Stanley, UK equities strategist Graham Secker says: 'The market will remain fragile for a while.' He expected a rally following the House of Representatives' approval late on Friday of the $700bn US bail-out package. The government deal to rescue the country's financial industry was passed by the Senate two days earlier. </p> <p>Secker says that although valuations look cheap historically, he doesn't expect the market to be much higher a year from now. 'But if your time horizon is a bit longer, there is an argument that says this is the moment to buy well-run, blue chip British companies with strong balance sheets.' BP and Vodafone are among his top choices.</p> <p>But as the real economy falters, with experts predicting rising unemployment as more businesses go to the wall, investors will need nerves of steel. Billions have been lost in financials; the leisure industry has also been badly hit, particularly pubs groups, which have had to withstand the double whammy of a ban on smoking, leading to lower sales, and a general downturn in consumer demand. Shares in Mitchells &amp; Butlers, for instance, have fallen from 600p to 224p in 12 months.</p> <p>Elsewhere, fears that the global resources boom could be over has left the miners out in the cold. Ferrexpo, the Ukrainian iron ore miner that floated 15 months ago, was one of the worst hit last week amid worries about whether it can find a joint venture partner to fund two undeveloped mines.</p> <p>ArcelorMittal, the steel-maker, has said it plans to cut production at its plant in Kazakhstan, which supplies Russia and China, by up to 30 per cent this year, a sign of lower demand for cars and new infrastructure projects.</p> <p>Copper has hit a 19-month low on figures showing weak industrial demand from the US. Other base metals have also fallen sharply since the start of the year. Oil has slumped from a high of $140 a barrel to $91, giving a much-needed lift to airline companies such as BA and Easyjet.</p> <p>But with market volatility forecast to remain high and the credit crisis showing no sign of abating, the outlook for shares is anything but certain.</p>",
  "<p>Born in Sudan into humble surroundings, he used to describe himself as a Marxist. He became a billionaire entrepreneur credited with transforming a continent. You might not have heard of Dr Mo Ibrahim, but today he is named as the most powerful black man in Britain.</p> <p>Ibrahim is credited with bringing the mobile phone revolution to Africa, making it the only continent where mobiles outnumber landlines and improving millions of lives. It is this achievement which gained the recognition of a judging panel which, after six months' research, has drawn up a <a href=\"http://www.powerlist2008.com/\">'Powerlist' of Britain's 100 most influential black people</a>.</p> <p>Celebrity is a stranger to Ibrahim, who has an estimated personal fortune of \u00a31.2bn and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/23/international.mainsection8\">runs a foundation for good governance in Africa</a>. Yet the judges decided that he wields more influence than high-profile figures including the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu; equality campaigner Trevor Phillips; government minister David Lammy; and England and Manchester United footballer Rio Ferdinand.</p> <p>The women's list is headed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jun/28/labour.uk11\">Baroness Scotland</a>, the first female black government minister. In second place is Claire Ighodaro, a corporate finance executive, followed by Michelle Ogundehin, editor-in-chief of Elle Decoration and Real Homes magazines.</p> <p>The list of 50 men and 50 women was compiled by a judging panel chaired by the former Leader of the House of Lords, Baroness Amos, and included the award-winning playwright and actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/05/britishidentity.race1\">Kwame Kwei-Armah</a>. It is published tomorrow by Powerful Media, which is organising a reception at the Foreign Office on Wednesday for what it believes will be 'the most powerful room of black people ever assembled in Britain'.</p> <p>But there will be no invitation for the supermodel Naomi Campbell or some of Britain's best known black pop stars. The judges made an effort to avoid clich\u00e9 ideas of black role models and to reflect the diversity of black achievement in Britain. The list includes architect David Adjaye, media executive Sonita Alleyne, barrister Daniel Alexander, actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, racing driver Lewis Hamilton, politician Oona King, social justice campaigner Doreen Lawrence, artist Steve McQueen, trade unionist Lord Morris, writer Zadie Smith and publisher Annette Thomas. </p> <p>The first annual powerlist report, sponsored by JP Morgan, acknowledges: 'It is probably fair to say that most people in Britain have never heard of Dr Mo Ibrahim but, arguably, he has revolutionised the lives of more people than anyone over the past 10 years.' </p> <p>It notes that, before Ibrahim set up the mobile company Celtel in 1998, there were only two million mobile phones in Africa; by the time he sold it seven years later there were 100 million. He has since launched the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/oct/26/moibrahim\">Mo Ibrahim Foundation</a>, which works for good governance in Africa, awarding a philanthropic cash prize to those who have 'demonstrated excellence in African leadership'.</p> <p>Michael Eboda, chief executive of Powerful Media, said: 'Mo Ibrahim is the sort of person who wouldn't just be number one on a black powerlist, he could be number one on any list. He has revolutionised a continent, transformed the way business is done, and is bringing Africa into the modern world. </p> <p>'He has gone on to be a philanthropist, to encourage good governance and accountability. He's also a humble man and doesn't seek publicity - a role model for entrepreneurs.'</p> <p>Ibrahim, Sudanese but raised in Egypt, came to Britain as a student in 1974 and went on to join BT. He said his place at the top of the list was 'very flattering' and he has never craved fame. 'I don't subscribe to the cult of celebrity,' he told The Observer. 'If I walk next to you in the street you won't know me. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/oct/26/moibrahim\">maybe we can change things and move Africa forward</a>. If we can improve democracy, raise standards of living, stop corruption - these are things that touch the everyday lives of normal people.'</p> <p>Ibrahim, 62, who divides his time between London and Monaco, describes himself as 'very proud' to be a British national. He praised the concept of the powerlist, adding: 'The important thing here is to produce black role models and show it's not all about music and football. I would like to see a black kid becoming an Einstein. The world is big and those kids need to know that, if they work hard, they can make it in business, journalism, advertising, whatever field they apply themselves to.'</p> <p>To qualify for the judging panel's consideration, an entrant had to be a British citizen or based in Britain. Many of those selected have lived abroad at some stage in their lives. After much discussion, 'influence' was defined as: 'The ability to alter events and change lives.'</p> <p>Second on the men's list is Tidjane Thiam, the Ivory Coast-born <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/21/15\">group finance director at Prudential</a>, who is tipped for the top job at the insurer. He is followed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/may/18/theobserver.observerbusiness9\">Damon Buffini</a>, chairman of the private equity company Permira, John Sentamu, and Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Equality and Human Rights. Phillips said of the list: 'It's important to show that there are people from minority communities who are playing a role in public life, ready to shoulder some of the burdens of the whole community, not just the narrow minority interest.'</p> <p>He added: 'There are two stereotypes: angry black men and suffering black women, and actually most of us are neither of those things. If people can stop thinking of black people they meet as fitting as one of those two stereotypes, they might look past the front page, which is their colour, and look at the individual rather than think of them as a category. This kind of exercise helps to do that and will make a huge difference to a lot of people's lives.'</p> <p>Eboda said that the title of most influential black woman in Britain was a 'shoo-in'. Yet at school Patricia Scotland was told by a careers adviser that the most she could hope for was to become a supervisor at Sainsbury's. She went on to be the first black woman in Britain to become a QC. Her appointment<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jun/29/uk.gordonbrown1\"> last year as the first female Attorney General</a>, the chief legal adviser to the government, was hailed as a historic breakthrough both for women and ethnic minorities.</p> <p>Scotland, 53, said: 'I don't think about myself in that way, but I was criticised just last week for not thinking that way. Others say to me I should be more obviously pleased about the fact that I seem to be \"the first\" all the time.' '</p> <p>Scotland is followed in the rankings by Claire Ighodaro, who holds numerous directorships at financial institutions; Michelle Ogundehin, described as 'Britain's most influential journalist on interior design and style matters'; Vivian Hunt, a director at management consultancy McKinsey &amp; Co; and Pat McGrath, the global cosmetics creative design director at Proctor &amp; Gamble.</p> <p>Diane Abbott MP, who placed seventh, said: 'I hope I can exercise some influence. There's a lot of negative publicity around gangs and guns and so on, but lists like this draw attention to people who are important and influential and positive role models in our community. We need to demonstrate that there's more going on in the black community than football.'</p> <p>The powerlist will be sent to Britain's 1,000 biggest companies and sold at WH Smith. It can be viewed at <a href=\"http://www.powerlist2008.com/\">powerlist2008.com</a>. Baroness Amos, who chaired the judging panel, said: 'It's about showcasing achievement, success and talent and crucially it's aspirational. I want our young people to know what they can achieve.'</p> <p>Explaining the omission of Naomi Campbell, Eboda added: 'It's no longer enough just to be famous.

  "<p>Britain's rivers could nearly run dry because long hot summers caused by climate change will not be sufficiently compensated by wetter winters, researchers predict. It is a scenario that would endanger wildlife and send household water bills soaring.</p> <p>Flows in the Mersey and Severn are likely to be reduced in summer by up to 80 per cent by 2050, according to a study by the Environment Agency. The Thames's flow is likely to decline by up to 50 per cent during the same period.</p> <p>It had been hoped that, as global warming leads to more extreme seasons, summer droughts would be offset by an increase in winter rainfall. However, while wetter winters are expected, they will not be damp enough to make up for the lack of rain during the hotter summers.</p> <p>The news might come as a surprise to people in towns such as Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, who have suffered flooding due to extraordinary downpours during the past two summers. But the agency claims that, while such extremes are a hallmark of climate change and wet summers will still occur, the overall average trend is towards drastically reduced river flows across the country.</p> <p>Ian Barker, head of water resources at the Environment Agency, said yesterday: 'For a long time, we've known climate change would result in wetter winters, which would increase winter flows in rivers, and that it would also result in drier summers. </p> <p>'The received wisdom was that the two would balance each other out and overall we'd end up with the same amount of water, just distributed differently throughout the year.</p> <p>'But we wanted to understand how much extra rainfall we might get in winter, and how much less rainfall we might get in summer. The net effect is that overall, although winter rainfall might increase by 10 per cent, the period of higher river flows is reduced, so it's perhaps only December, January, February, maybe into March. The period when you'd see lower river flows because the rainfall is significantly less would extend from April right through to November in some parts of the country.' Barker warned: 'Overall, it means that, by the 2050s, there's a net reduction in the amount of water resources available for water companies to pump out of rivers, farmers to use for irrigation and also to support wildlife in rivers. </p> <p>'If you get reduced flows, in summer the temperature of the water will increase, there's less water to dilute pollution, and that will also affect what is in our rivers.'</p> <p>The research used climate projections from the UK Climate Impacts Programme and shows that by 2050 river flows in winter may rise by 10 to 15 per cent in England and Wales. But river flows in late summer and early autumn could fall by as much as 80 per cent in some places. These patterns would result in a drop in total annual river flow of up to 15 per cent. </p> <p>But Professor Stuart Lane, executive director of the Institute of Hazard and Risk Research at Durham University, issued two caveats. 'First, something that's quite clear in the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report issued last year is that our ability to forecast rainfall precipitation is particularly poor when compared with our ability to predict temperature,' he said. </p> <p>'Second, these kind of average figures often overlook what most people will experience - indeed, a lot of people find it very difficult to relate to predictions like these because we will always have both wet summers and dry summers, and wet summers are actually quite normal. </p> <p>'What that means is these are average changes and it's quite possible that the kind of drought scenarios that are being talked about here could be much worse or not as bad on a year-to-year basis.'</p>",
  "<p>It was, unsurprisingly, an emotional moment. When Peter Mandelson was summoned to tea at Downing Street last Thursday afternoon, it marked the end of a very long exile.</p> <p>Fourteen years after an intense friendship with Gordon Brown was ripped apart at the seams when Mandelson backed Tony Blair for the Labour leadership, one of the most epic vendettas in British politics was suspended. </p> <p>The crisis, both economic and political, now engulfing Brown had reached sufficient magnitude to persuade the odd couple once described by Tony Blair as the two most brilliant minds of their generation to throw their lot in together. </p> <p>'Peter was genuinely surprised when he was asked, and rather emotional,' says a friend. 'It was a soundbite - \"third time lucky\" - but I think it's what Peter's hoping. He's hoping to show the better part of him.'</p> <p>Intriguingly, however, Mandelson did not immediately accept. He only finally said yes on Friday morning, after consulting Blair first - precipitating a hasty game of musical chairs that catapulted the Defence Secretary, Des Browne, on to the backbenches. The new Business Secretary's historic doubts about Brown do not appear to have entirely vanished. </p> <p>Like an ageing rock band reforming for one last money-spinning tour, New Labour last week wheeled out its old stars - Mandelson, Margaret Beckett and Nick Brown in Cabinet, with Alastair Campbell hovering on the sidelines and John Prescott running a campaign for a fourth term from the back benches - for one last bid to rekindle the Nineties magic. They may be bickering backstage, the argument goes, but so what if they can get the crowd on its feet again?</p> <p>'If the opinion polls turn in our favour, by which I mean if we are only 10 points behind, then it's game on: it's winnable,' says one Cabinet aide. 'That's why the Mandelson appointment is quite smart: it says, \"Look, we've had our mini internal strife and it's over now. We're back\".'</p> <p>The resurrection of Labour's own Lord Voldemort has certainly recaptured the political momentum from the Tories and in effect blocked any Cabinet insurrection against Brown. </p> <p>For what it signifies is that Tony Blair's inner circle has thrown in the towel, driven by a combination of David Miliband's underwhelming performance at the party conference and the threat of a resounding electoral defeat. As one well-placed party source puts it: 'David Miliband lost his chance to be leader of the Labour party on Friday.' </p> <p>Campbell fiercely defended Brown at a dinner of old Labour friends last week, arguing there was no alternative. Mandelson would not have thrown his weight behind Brown if he thought Miliband could turn the party around, neither would Blair have encouraged him. 'It was very much Tony's view that he should do it, for the \"all hands on deck\" reason that Peter gave,' says a friend of the former prime minister. </p> <p>And what Blairite minister could now argue, with Mandelson back in harness, that the party has lost its way? Even the possibility of a coup next June after the European elections, in which Labour is expected to do badly, has been threatened by the decision to make Caroline Flint Europe minister - providing a Blairite scapegoat if things go wrong. </p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, not all Mandelson's friends think he has done the right thing. 'You can't tell: we've just got to see how it plays out,' says one senior MP close to him. 'Gordon has had a very good fortnight. The world's collapsing, of course, but Gordon's having a good time.'</p> <p>This weekend, however, the painful process of readjustment is beginning. The pecking order in Cabinet will inevitably shift to accommodate such a big beast. What happens to Douglas Alexander's role as election co-ordinator, with Mandelson tipped to help out on the campaign? Where does Ed Balls fit now that his mentor has a new best friend?</p> <p>And after a reshuffle that reshaped the whole government around the needs of the City, the Chancellor may not have been moved, but the political earth has moved under him. Gordon Brown's biggest purge this weekend seems not to have been of his enemies, but of his friends. </p> <p>The question drew knowing laughter around Manchester Town Hall two weeks ago: did the panel assembled by the Fabian Society for its fringe meeting feel, amid a global banking crisis, 'intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich'? And if not, would it repudiate the remark's author - Peter Mandelson?</p> <p>Balls paused before answering stiltedly: a gap between the rich and poor was 'really unhealthy', but those who worked hard should be able to reap rewards. What Balls, and nobody else in the room, knew, thanks to a heated heart-to-heart with Brown over the summer in Scotland, was that his sworn enemy was being seriously considered for a comeback. Perhaps Balls needed to hedge his bets. </p> <p>This weekend, the populist theme of the Manchester party conference - curbing City greed and tackling the bonus culture - is already looking outdated. Labour can hardly attack the Tories for being in bed with big business after making Paul Myners, director of a hedge fund implicated in short-selling bank shares, City minister or appointing ex-merchant banker Shriti Vadera to a powerful new Cabinet Office post. </p> <p>Millionaire entrepreneur Lord Drayson, who has returned to government after a year spent racing cars, will now attend cabinet, bringing another powerful City voice to the table.</p> <p>Far from lurching leftwards, Downing Street is now boasting about its wealth of 'outside experience', the British equivalent of the hands-on business knowledge that George W. Bush gets from his Treasury Secretary, the ex-banker Hank Paulson. </p> <p>None the less, the sudden proliferation of rival economic expertise has left the Chancellor - trapped between an interfering Prime Minister and a powerful new Business Secretary - looking marginalised even without the explosive addition of Vadera. </p> <p>Renowned for her steely manner, she is so devoted to Brown that she used to fly to Scotland at weekends and rent a hotel room near his Queensferry home in case he needed her. He relied on her to help negotiate the recent British bank rescue deals, to the Treasury's irritation, inviting her to brief the cabinet on the crisis: more intriguingly, she has also forged a working relationship with Mandelson. Her new post gives her even better access to her boss's ear - a situation being gleefully monitored by the Tories, who are ready to pounce on any further tensions between the Treasury and Downing Street. </p> <p>Relations between Brown and Darling were first strained by the Budget, when the two rowed over whether the Chancellor should downgrade economic growth forecasts. Downing Street then overruled the Treasury to insist on a stamp duty cut for first-time buyers, despite warnings that property taxes were more or less irrelevant to the house price crash, and there were furious rows after Alistair Darling's suggestion in a Guardian interview that the economy was in its worst peril for 60 years - now looking, if anything, like a understatement. </p> <p>But the Chancellor is not the only Brownite with his nose out of joint. Late on Friday, the Prime Minister quietly surrendered to pressure to ditch Ian Austin as his parliamentary aide, his eyes and ears in the Commons tearooms. </p> <p>The unswervingly loyal Austin will be moved to the whips' office and replaced by the leftwinger Jon Trickett - former leader of the soft-left Compass Group of MPs - to help bind the left into the war effort. </p> <p>Brown's spin doctor, Damian McBride, who has been with him since his Treasury days and helped put Brown where he is today, also told colleagues last week that he would be retiring from the front line. His departure is a victory for ministers who blamed him - often inaccurately - for spreading malicious gossip, but also ensures he will not have to work with Mandelson, who is said to be itching to oversee the spin operation. </p> <p>And as the dust from Friday's extraordinary announcement starts to settle this weekend, it is the precise extent of Mandelson's ambitions for this job that has already begun to ruffle feathers. </p> <p>Early this summer, his confidence at rock bottom following swingeing defeats in the local elections and the Crewe by-election, a chastened Prime Minister finally swallowed his pride and asked for help. What ensued over the summer was a series of highly secret meetings with a handful of Blairites who had spent their professional lives trying to keep him out of power.</p> <p>Alan Milburn was summoned for a series of chats about policy, which ended abruptly when it became clear the two could not agree. Alastair Campbell became a more successful confidant, offering informal advice.</p> <p>But the really surprising development was a series of regular phone calls between Brown and Mandelson over the summer, encouraged by Campbell, in which they edged towards a reconciliation. 'Gordon was very subtly sounding Peter out [about a return]: Peter very subtly didn't completely pour cold water on it,' says one source close to the discussions.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the tentative flirtation went cold: by August, Mandelson was praising David Miliband's infamous Guardian article, seen as a covert attack on Brown. It was not until last week, when, in the aftermath of his relative success at party conference, Brown confided in a handful of intimates, including Balls, that he was now serious about inviting Mandelson back, that it became clear the door was open. </p> <p>What was still unclear yesterday is just how open. Alexander remains the cabinet's election co-ordinator, but friends of Mandelson suggest he is more than willing to roll up his sleeves and help. There are hints that he may get his way. 'Who knows what might happen in the future, but that is not something that has happened in the past 24 hours,' says a Downing Street source, asked if Mandelson would formally take on some election preparation. Further changes to the spin operation are expected. </p> <p>And if the reshuffle of senior ministers has thrown up problems, the purge of juniors also hit the rocks late on Friday. With Brown insisting on personally telephoning every single minister who is on the move, progress was always going to be slow, but then a significant spanner was thrown into the works. </p> <p>After Jon Cruddas, the darling of the left - and the star of the party conference fringe - publicly revealed that he would like a government job, Brown had little choice but to make an offer. However he turned up his nose at the offer of a junior post in charge of skills and apprenticeship and at least one other post. </p> <p>By Saturday morning, he was still locked in negotiations with Downing Street about a role in the party - a potential threat to party chairman Harriet Harman, who beat him in last year's deputy leadership contest. 'I don't know whether he has unreasonable expectations about this job he thinks he's entitled to, but we've got a deputy leader and he lost to her,' said one cabinet aide. </p> <p>But the dark horse emerging from the reshuffle, happy to be overshadowed by the furore over Mandelson, is the new Secretary of State for Climate Change and Energy. Ed Miliband has not only been given a new job positioning him perfectly to confront any backsliding by David Cameron on green issues, but will continue to draft the next election manifesto. It is a steep learning curve for a relative novice, but if he pulls it off Labour's tectonic plates could shift again. The quashing of David Miliband's ambitions last week has unexpectedly propelled his younger brother into the dangerous position of the family's rising star. </p> <p>After Friday, the odds shifted narrowly but decisively in favour of Brown leading Labour through to the next election. What happens after that is, however, an open question, with speculation that, even if he won, Brown would not serve a full second term. </p> <p>'What's extraordinary is that James Purnell and Ed Miliband will leapfrog over David now [in the leadership stakes] and to be honest that makes for an interesting future,' says one party aide. 'Do we end up choosing between the two of them?' The ripples from this reshuffle may be spreading for years to come.</p>",
  "<p>Such is the disorientation created by the earthquake in global finance that some US Republicans last week accused President George Bush of 'socialism' for bailing out the country's financial system. Seismic activity can alter the landscape, but it cannot turn right into left. Mr Bush has not embraced Marxism. He simply recognised that leaving the market free to demolish banks would lead to economic catastrophe.</p> <p>That realisation came more naturally in Europe. French President Nicolas Sarkozy declared that 'the all-powerful market is finished'. Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, the German finance minister, predicted that the US will lose its role as a 'financial superpower'. His Italian counterpart, Giulio Tremonti, pointed out that he had written a book on the ills of globalisation, and was now vindicated. But none of their respective countries is in a position to lead the construction of a new global financial order.</p> <p>The current market turbulence does not distinguish between brands of capitalism. Financial institutions in nearly every Western economy are on the brink of collapse. Last week governments in Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, Greece, Ireland and the Netherlands all took emergency measures to rescue failing banks. In some cases, reaction appeared motivated by blind panic. Irish and Greek offers of unlimited guarantees for bank deposits were not just unilateral, they jeopardised any prospect of eurozone solidarity.</p> <p>Last night's call for a global summit by EU leaders, who have been meeting in Paris, is encouraging, suggesting a real effort by member states to overcome instinctive divisions over how to run an economy. Of the union's largest economies, Britain has favoured the 'Anglo-Saxon' model of maximum liberalisation while France and Germany have no qualms about state intervention. It is testimony to an historic failure of political will that Europe's leaders only began to negotiate past those ideological barriers when faced with a crisis of this magnitude.</p> <p>Even with the EU mobilised and the US bailout approved, the road ahead is desperately uncertain. Emergency liquidity funds might help douse the flames in the financial markets, but the discussion about what should be built in the smouldering remains has barely even begun.</p> <p>Both candidates in the US presidential election campaign backed the bailout, but neither explained how their own plans for government might be redrawn to fit the new economic landscape.</p> <p>In Britain, market convulsions forced the Tories to rewrite their conference agenda last week. David Cameron declared his readiness to take 'difficult' and 'unpopular' decisions. But that was simply a euphemism for raising taxes and cutting services to balance the government books. He also said there would be 'a day of reckoning' for profligate bankers, but in the next breath he deferred that day indefinitely.</p> <p>The more remarkable political gyration last week was performed by Gordon Brown. Just over a year ago, he promised to 'renew' the party and heal the divisions of the Blair era. On Friday, he appointed Peter Mandelson, Tony Blair's grey cardinal, to the same cabinet post he held in 1998. Brown now appears to recognise that events of this magnitude mean government has to think in fundamentally different ways about the economy, beyond the fine-tuning of fiscal and monetary policy, and instead deal with a world of food and energy shortages, as well as a credit drought.</p> <p>The Bank of England last week quietly increased the amount of emergency credit available to banks to levels equivalent in scale to the US bailout. Neither Labour nor the Tories, for all their claims, has yet spelled out what regulations should be demanded of the City as quid pro quo. No politician in Britain, the rest of Europe or the US has an answer to one basic question: how will the financial services be overhauled so they are, in future, the servant, not the master, of the global economy? We wait to see if Brown's new cabinet will offer a lead.</p> <p>The old ideological distinctions between different forms of capitalism may be melting away in the banking crisis. But for the moment, it is still the politicians, not the bankers, who look humbled by its scale.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Winning question:</strong> Having read a couple of your articles, I am curious as to whether it is possible to look after your skin while being on minimum wage? I want to remove blackheads, but can't possibly afford a \u00a395 facial every couple of months. Likewise I want to cleanse and moisturise my skin but you talk of 'nasty cheap cleansers' and that it's perfectly reasonable to spend \u00a3100 on a moisturiser. Are you sponsored by the people who make these products? Could you suggest some products for those of us not earning the apparently ludicrous amounts of money that beauty journalists are earning, please? <br><strong>Katy Quigley</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Thank you for your letter. Sadly, you haven't seen some of my columns which highlight the better budget priced products - for instance, Olay, Neal's Yard, Neutrogena, Burt's Bees and Roc are all brands that I regularly rate highly. </p> <p>I can assure you I don't get sponsorship from any cosmetic companies and my recommendations genuinely only come from having spent 25 years or more trying products and treatments of all price ranges and types just to find out what works and what doesn't, and pass it on to our readers.</p> <p>If I talked of 'cheap' cleansers, it would have been in the context of being careful not to strip the face of its natural balance which sets up all sorts of further problems. </p> <p>I completely understand that you might not be able to afford a facial every month (I don't have a facial every month myself). But perhaps, if your skin is important to you - a professional facial could now go on a wish list as a present for someone to give you one day? </p> <p>When I recommend a very expensive moisturiser, such as Sisley Sisleya Global Anti-Age Extra-Rich Cream or Est\u00e9e Lauder Re-Nutriv Ultimate Youth Cream, both of which retail for three-figure sums it's not that I find it 'perfectly reasonable' to expect people to have lots of money at their disposal, but because in terms of quality and texture it may last three times as long and be three times as effective as a bad, cheap one.</p> <p>For a facial and in fact several other ideas for treatments at home, from spas to pedicures, you could try this website: <a href=\"http://www.lindisima.com/en/facials_at_home.htm\">lindisima.com</a>. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I have a scar on my face that remains white when I get a suntan. I can't seem to find a fake tan to colour in the area, nothing seems to absorb on scar tissue. Can you help? <br><strong>Romy Balfour</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I asked make-up artist Louise Constad about this. The obvious make-up range for scarring is Dermablend (<a href=\"http://www.dermablend.com\">dermablend.com</a>), but often scar make-ups are too thick and the cover shows more than the scar! This is where a make-up lesson with Louise makes sense. She's a great make-up artist with her own bespoke service, <a href=\"http://www.beautyqueenworkshops.com\">beautyqueenworkshops.com</a>. She says, 'Try colouring the scar with a flesh-coloured pencil, (slightly darker than your skin colour). Shiseido does three flesh-coloured pencils (\u00a37.95, <a href=\"http://www.lapreya.com\">lapreya.com</a>), these will be perfect for disguising the scar.' Mac has great flesh-coloured eyeshadows, again that are perfect for concealing. First apply your moisturiser, then immediately add the eyeshadow - this will help it stick and hold in the scar area. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I love Benefit's angled-brush mascara. Is there a high-street alternative for less than \u00a310? <br><strong>Gemma Lyons </strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Is it the angled brush that you like or the mascara? There are plenty of high-street names that make mascara for under \u00a310 that I think are good, including Max Factor, Rimmel and Bourjois.

  "<p>In one photograph a young boy, his arms spread as if in supplication, gazes listlessly at the ceiling as a woman - his mother, we presume - cradles him tenderly in her arms. In another, a grey-haired man attached to an oxygen cylinder sits cross-legged on a hospital bed staring vacantly into the middle distance. In two further pictures we encounter similar expressions, this time in the eyes of a man bundled up in bed taking his meds and a baby framed against the film of a chest X-ray occluded by ghostly white shadows.</p> <p>The child in the first picture is Chan Thai, a 12-year-old from Svay Reing in Cambodia. He is pictured in the throes of tuberculosis meningitis, a disease that should no longer afflict children in this century. The names of the others have not been recorded, but whether from India or Lesotho, Swaziland or Siberia, they too are victims of TB, a disease now re-emerging in a deadly new form with devastating consequences in villages, shanty towns and cities across the globe.</p> <p>'Tuberculosis is a shocking disease,' explains James Nachtwey, the American war photographer behind these extraordinary images. 'I'm a very experienced journalist. I've seen a lot of terrible things in this world, but witnessing TB is something that affected me as profoundly as anything I saw in Iraq or Afghanistan. My heart went out to the victims and when people see these photographs I hope their hearts will go out to them, too.'</p> <p>Starting this weekend, Nachtwey will get his wish when TED, a New York-based organisation that brings together leading scientists, thinkers and designers committed to social change, begins exhibiting his photographs in galleries around the world. The brainchild of Chris Anderson, a former magazine entrepreneur, TED grants $100,000 to three outstanding people each year and gives them 'one wish to change the world'. Nachtwey's was to use his skills as a photojournalist to raise global awareness of 'extensively drug resistant tuberculosis' (XDR-TB for short) and in the process demonstrate the power of news photography in the digital age.</p> <p>With TED's funding, Nachtwey travelled to countries as diverse as Cambodia, Siberia, Rwanda and India, documenting the depredations of XDR-TB and the efforts of governments and NGOs to pioneer new treatment programmes that may arrest the disease's progression. On Friday, TED unveiled a slide show of more than 50 of Nachtwey's images at the Lincoln Center in New York and the National Theatre in London. Over the next few weeks the same photographs will be shown on outdoor screens in 50 cities worldwide and on the internet as part of a multimedia campaign that aims to harness the power of the web and 'viral marketing' techniques. At the same time the UK think-tank Demos will exhibit Nachtwey's photographs in a gallery in Brick Lane, east London, renamed the Emergency Room.</p> <p>Nachtwey's aim is to bring TB more into the 'mass consciousness,' in the hope of kick-starting an action campaign that can leverage more funds for aid. 'The problem at the moment is that very few people in the West are even conscious of TB,' he says. 'The more people are aware of it, the easier it is to raise funds and get sponsorship for research.'</p> <p>Tuberculosis is one of the oldest diseases known to man and certainly one of the deadliest. Evidence of tuberculosis has been found in the skeletons of Egyptian mummies and in an Iron Age settlement in Dorset. Scientists estimate that in the past 400 years TB has killed some 2bn people worldwide, and disfigured, crippled and blinded countless more. It is not for nothing that the 17th-century English writer and preacher John Bunyan called TB 'the captain of all these men of death'.</p> <p>Spread like the common cold or flu by coughing and sneezing, the tubercle bacillus most commonly infects the lungs, slowly eating away at the spongy tissue essential for respiration and forming abscesses that discharge foul-smelling pus. However, the microbe spares no part of the human body and can also spill into the digestive tract, causing ulcerations of the throat and bloody diarrhoea, or into the bloodstream where it causes a condition known as milliary tuberculosis that can prove fatal to the kidneys, heart and other organs. If it crosses the blood-brain barrier, TB can also cause meningitis, coma and death.</p> <p>More usually, however, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a seductively slow assassin. Hippocrates labelled the disease phthisis - from the Greek term for 'wasting' - because of the way that patients under its influence seemed to gradually wither away, and even after Robert Koch's groundbreaking isolation of the bacillus in 1882 doctors continued to refer to TB as 'consumption' well into the Twenties. At the height of the disease's prevalence in the 18th and 19th centuries it claimed the lives of as many as 100,000 Britons every year. Prominent victims included John Keats, Emily Bront\u00eb and Robert Louis Stevenson - associations that gave it an aura of romance and poetry. However, for anyone who has witnessed the disease at close hand, there is nothing romantic about TB, and today it is back with a vengeance.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that every year TB kills 1.6m people - or one person every 18 seconds (by contrast, malaria is responsible for some 1m deaths worldwide, or roughly one person every 30 seconds). Although that is still short of the annual death toll from HIV/Aids (between 1.8m and 2.3m), separating the two diseases increasingly makes little sense. 'If there's a high population with HIV, then people are much more susceptible to the disease,' explains Nachtwey.</p> <p>Born in Syracuse, New York, Nachtwey made his name as a witness to some of the world's bloodiest and most intractable conflicts. A five- times winner of the Robert Capa Gold Medal, he covered the Troubles in Northern Ireland in the early Eighties, the Serb invasion of Kosovo in 1999 and countless other war and famine zones from Bosnia to the Sudan. In 2003 Nachtwey was on assignment with a US Army platoon in Iraq when an insurgent tossed a grenade into his Humvee. The grenade severed the hand of one of his journalistic colleagues, but Nachtwey still had the wherewithal to photograph the medics who came to their rescue before he passed out.</p> <p>He first became interested in TB in 2000 when Time magazine sent him to South Africa to cover Aids. The government was still in denial over the scale of the epidemic, but visiting villages and wards where people with HIV were sent for 'treatment for TB', it soon became obvious that the two diseases were linked and the problem was growing.</p> <p>Then, in 2003, the Cambodian Health Committee (CHC), an independent NGO that is the brainchild of Harvard infectious disease expert Dr Anne Goldfeld and a former Cambodian refugee worker Dr Sok Thim, invited Nachtwey to document their in-country treatment programme. Nachtwey travelled with Thim to Svay Reing, delivering drugs to remote rural areas and going on house visits. It was during one of these visits that he photographed a 12-year-old peasant boy who had just lost his mother to TB. Nachtwey arrived just as the boy, dressed in Buddhist robes, was preparing to lead the funeral procession through the paddy fields to the funeral pyre. His photograph of Va Ling, clutching a framed picture of his mother to his chest, is both moving and timeless. Exhibited in 2007 at the United Nations in New York on the occasion of World TB Day, it was this photograph - and the reaction to it - that convinced Nachtwey that a slide show of similarly arresting images could be a means of raising consciousness of TB worldwide.'There are lots of very impressive statistics about TB, but I wanted to put a human face on it.'</p> <p>With TED's help, Nachtwey visited seven countries blighted by XDR-TB, returning to Cambodia and South Africa but also documenting new TB hotspots such as Rwanda, Lesotho, Swaziland and Siberia. </p> <p>An airborne rod-like microbe, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is most commonly transmitted in air droplets when someone coughs or sneezes. The good news is that unlike a cold or flu, TB is not highly contagious - it usually takes several hours of continuous exposure for a sick person to transmit the disease to someone who is healthy. The bad news, however, is that the bacillus can hang around in the atmosphere for weeks or months - much longer than other bacteria - and although 60 per cent of those infected will successfully fight off and destroy an infection, one in three people continues to carry the bacillus in dormant form. The danger is that if their immune system is suddenly compromised or they are infected with HIV, these latent infections may revive.</p> <p>Even so, if TB is diagnosed early, it is eminently treatable, usually with a six- to eight-month course of oral antibiotics. However, if patients fail to complete the prescribed course of treatment, the bacteria may become resistant, meaning doctors have to prescribe other harder-to-tolerate second-line medications, for periods of between one and two years. This in turn makes compliance even harder, resulting in a vicious cycle of rising rates of multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and new infections.</p> <p>Resistance to streptomycin, the original TB drug, was first reported in 1948. Since then the bacillus has also bred resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid - the front-line combination therapies recommended by the WHO - as well as to many second-line oral antibiotics and third-line injectable drugs. </p> <p>The result is that last year there were 500,000 new cases of MDR-TB, of which 2 per cent were deemed by the WHO to be XDR-TB and 'virtually untreatable'. Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, and Tomsk Oblast in Siberia, which houses a 7,000-strong prison population, were particularly hard hit with some of the highest rates of MDR-TB ever recorded.</p> <p>In South Africa TB is closely linked to rising rates of HIV, whereas in Russia the resurgence of the disease can be traced to the economic dislocation that followed the demise of the Soviet Union. As health and social services collapsed and alcoholism skyrocketed, many people developed TB because their immune systems, weakened by drugs, alcohol and poor nutrition, could no longer keep latent TB in check. During the long, cold Siberian winters, the hallways and unventilated cells of the Tomsk jails also provided ideal conditions for the transmission of the virus, resulting in the prisons becoming an 'epidemiological pump' spreading the disease throughout the general population.</p> <p>As part of his journey Nachtwey visited one of the Tomsk prison colonies. His guide was Partners-in-Health (PIH), a Boston-based NGO founded by Dr Paul Farmer that helps manage treatment programmes inside Siberian prisons, as well as in community settings.</p> <p>When PIH first arrived in the region, the WHO had effectively written off MDR-TB as untreatable. Instead, it was insisting that Russia adopt its directly observed therapy short course (DOTS) treatment programme, despite the fact that in many parts of the country chemists had run out of the oral antibiotics.</p> <p>Armed with a $10m grant from the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria, PIH adopted a different strategy. Beginning in 2000 it encouraged local doctors, first in the prison system and then throughout the region, to treat all cases of MDR-TB aggressively. At around the same time, the WHO agreed to green-light the supply of second-line drugs at sharply reduced prices. The result was that the cost of treating a patient was halved, from around \u00a36,000 to \u00a33,000, and compliance rates shot up. Today, PIH claims its 'DOTS-plus' programme in Siberia is achieving a near 80 per cent cure rate. However, while the deaths from TB are down, drug resistance is still rising - about 15 per cent of new cases according to the latest figures.</p> <p>Despite this setback, Nachtwey insists PIH's programme is a rare success story. 'They've shown that in most cases TB can be cured - you can actually be healed.'</p> <p>Nachtwey was similarly impressed by PIH's facility at a hospital in Maseru, Lesotho, which it runs in partnership with the government and which boasts similar cure rates. And in India, which has the highest number of TB cases of any country in the world, he spent 10 days visiting hospitals and clinics in Mumbai and Chennai, where he found government programmes are also well organised.</p> <p>However, the country he knows best and where he has seen the most marked progress is Cambodia. When Sok Thim and Anne Goldfeld founded the CHC in 1994 the country had some of the highest TB rates in the world. As in Russia, the MDR-TB cases were considered untreatable. Goldfeld and Thim changed all that by offering patients free medication if they signed a contract pledging they would finish their treatment and by getting friends and family to serve as co-guarantors. At the same time CHC negotiated nutritional supplements from the World Food Program, thus reducing the likelihood that patients and their families would go hungry - a key factor in speeding recovery. </p> <p>The result is that CHC has treated 13,000 Cambodians for TB and boasts cure rates as high as 95 per cent. At the same time, Goldfeld, who also runs a biomedical research lab at Harvard, has been able to identify a key susceptibility gene for TB and a unique immune reaction that helps the microbe evade human immune defences - research that may eventually lead to new treatments and vaccines.</p> <p>Now, with the help of the WHO, Goldfeld is negotiating wider access to subsidised drugs and running a trial looking at the best timing for medications for patients with dual TB/HIV infections.</p> <p>'Our programmes show that everyone can be well if you give them the right education and support,' says Goldfeld. 'It doesn't matter if you live in the city or the poorest part of Cambodia. If you get the drugs to people and provide communities with food and other forms of support, TB can be beaten.'</p> <p>However, for all the progress that has been made in Svay Reing, CHC operates on a shoestring and can't be there to treat every patient or prevent every new infection. This is the true tragedy of TB. Sometime between the Twenties (when French researchers first developed the BCG vaccine) and the Fifties (when the vaccine was first given to schoolchildren in Britain and other European countries), the West took its eye off the ball. Thinking that TB had been consigned to the dustbin of medical history, we failed to invest in new drugs or better vaccines that would extend the protection conferred by the BCG to adults in later life. As Paul Farmer, the founder of PIH and a medical anthropologist with years of experience treating TB and other infectious diseases puts it: 'In failing to curb tuberculosis a window of opportunity has been slammed shut. We must acknowledge that our guilt surpasses that of earlier generations who lacked our resources.'</p> <p>Chan Thai is a case in point. Tuberculosis meningitis is extremely rare in the UK thanks to immunisation with the BCG and good child healthcare services. Not so in Cambodia. Nachtwey and Goldfeld first encountered Chan Thai at the local hospital in Svay Reing where his mother had brought him for emergency treatment. One of four children from a farming family, Chan Thai had collapsed suddenly at home with a fever and convulsions. At hospital he was given a spinal tap and a cocktail of antibiotics. Even so, doctors couldn't prevent him suffering further seizures and slipping into a coma. Fortunately, he recovered and was eventually able to return home. </p> <p>Nevertheless, when Nachtwey took his photograph, says Goldfeld, Chan Thai was still clearly mentally discombobulated - hence the vacant, far-away look in his eyes. 'This is not MDR-TB, this is what even normal TB can do,' says Goldfeld. 'Although the picture was taken in Cambodia, it could have been taken in Kosovo or Cuzco - anywhere that TB is rampant.'</p> <p>Details of Nachtwey's slide show are on <a href=\"http://www.xdrtb.org.\">www.xdrtb.org.</a> For further information about TB worldwide or to donate to TB Alert, go to <a href=\"http://www.tbalert.org\">www.tbalert.org</a> or <a href=\"http://www.stoptb.org\">www.stoptb.org</a>.</p>",
  "<h2>Ed Miliband</h2> <p>David Miliband has always joked that his younger brother, Ed, had all the luck with women. Now it seems that the political luck may be running his way, too. </p> <p>His promotion to Secretary of State for Climate Change and Energy, together with an unexpectedly strong performance at last month's Labour party conference, has propelled the younger Miliband into the limelight just as his older brother's ambitions appear to have been crushed. Could there be two potential Labour leaders in the family? </p> <p>The sons of Marxist academic Ralph Miliband, both boys were raised in a hothouse of political and economic argument and followed each other through the same Oxford college, Corpus Christi, where both studied PPE. </p> <p>But while David went to work for Tony Blair, Ed - three years David's junior - got his first big break when he was hired to write speeches for Harriet Harman in opposition. She recommended him to Gordon Brown and he joined the Treasury as an economic adviser in 1997. </p> <p>For years, the brothers bridged the divide between their political masters, with Ed developing a reputation among Blairites as the acceptable face of the Brown camp. </p> <p>More relaxed and laid-back than his brother, Ed has a mischievous sense of humour overlaying the same fierce intellect. Friends say the year he spent at Harvard, taking a sabbatical from the Treasury, helped him to emerge from David's shadow. He was genuinely torn over whether to follow his brother into the Commons. However, he was elected to Doncaster North in 2005 and has risen quickly up the ranks, entering the Cabinet within two years when Brown became leader. </p> <p>He has a steep learning curve ahead of him at the new department, which has been carved from two previous departments that were often at war with each other, and faces a series of difficult decisions. </p> <p>Tomorrow, his department is being taken to judicial review by charities that are alleging it has done too little for fuel poverty: within days, he will receive a report from the power regulator, Ofgem, on the pricing of electricity and gas bills, another political hot potato. </p> <p>He is already under pressure from green activists to stop the building of the controversial new Kingsnorth coal-fired power station. </p> <p>He will also continue writing the next election manifesto, a sign of his continued closeness to the PM. </p> <p>If the younger Miliband needs advice, however, he does not have far to look.

  "<p>Fears are mounting that many Wall Street banks and financial firms will refuse to participate in the US government's $700bn bail-out package, leaving global markets and world economies in a perilous state for months to come.</p> <p>'There is a growing feeling that banks ... might instead decide to tough it out,' said Thomas Caldwell, chairman and CEO of Caldwell Financial, a $1bn-plus fund manager.</p> <p>For the past two weeks all eyes in the market have been focused on US Congress and its attempts to pass Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's bail-out package - a bill to allow the US government to buy up to $700bn of toxic mortgage-related assets from American banks, which would in theory free the credit markets and set the gears of global commerce spinning once more.</p> <p>Last Monday, after the bill was thrown out by the House of Representatives, more than $1 trillion was wiped off the value of US stocks as the market was gripped by panic. The bill was passed on Friday afternoon, however, after the inclusion of $149bn of tax breaks and strict rules for participating banks.</p> <p>But Wall Street analysts, believe the addition of so many terms to the bill might deter potential participants. </p> <p>One of the least attractive elements is a section designed to curb executive pay at banks that participate in the bail-out package. These include limiting stock-related pay and banning 'golden parachutes' for executives.</p> <p>'I think this hodge-podge of regulations and rules will be enough to put many [chief executives] off participating,' Caldwell said. </p> <p>Sources close to Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch indicated the banks might choose not to participate in the bail-out as there is a growing view on Wall Street that the market may be bottoming out.</p> <p>Analysts also believe that the mere presence of the government as buyer of last resort will be enough to get credit markets moving again, and that a large number of banks would not need to take part for the legislation to succeed.</p> <p>Wall Street ended its worst week in seven years with another tumble on Friday.

  "<p>Last week's big food story was one of haves and have nots. The haves include Tesco, which announced half-year profits of \u00a31.5bn on the back of rising global food prices and booming sales of organics. The shelves are full and business is brisk. The have nots were the benighted populations of Ethiopia and Somalia in the Horn of Africa, which, the UN warns, is heading into the worst famine in generations. The one thing these two stories share is a negative: British supermarkets and large slabs of Africa are both entirely free of genetically modified foods.</p> <p>According to the government's former chief scientist, Sir David King, these narratives are completely intertwined.</p> <p>In a recent speech to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, King accused the British middle classes of putting lives at risk in the developing world through their food choices. 'The problem is,' he said, 'the Western world's move toward organic farming - a lifestyle choice - and against agricultural technology and GM in particular, has been adopted across Africa ... with devastating consequences.'</p> <p>It was proof of just how divisive the debate over the genetic modification of our crops has become. On the one side are the biotech companies and their supporters in the scientific community who believe GM has the potential to reduce the cost of food, increase yields and bring into cultivation land that might otherwise have remained barren, thus helping to feed the growing number of the world's hungry. On the other side are the environmentalists, who predict that a vicious toll will be paid in what these new, under-regulated foods will do to our bodies and to the planet.</p> <p>On Friday the opponents of GM felt they had something to celebrate as news of the government reshuffle broke. Two weeks before, at a Labour conference fringe meeting, food and farming minister Jeff Rooker was laying into the anti-GM crowd for wallowing in 'ignorance', and being on a 'messianic mission' to kill the technology. 'It is like a religion, but there is no science base to it.' Now suddenly Rooker was out, not just from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - itself to be divided up - but from the entire government.</p> <p>If his critics took Rooker's departure as an excuse to pop the corks on a few bottles of organic, bio-dynamic champagne, they would have been premature. Because the news that Hillary Benn was to head the new food and environment ministry, hived off from Defra, was proof that the Brown government's increasingly noisy pursuit of a pro-GM agenda was to continue. After all, Benn has hardly been a friend of those who have been calling for an end to all GM experiments. 'We need to see if they have a contribution to make,' he told another conference fringe meeting, 'and we won't know the answer about their environmental impacts unless we run controlled experiments. It's important we go with the science.'</p> <p>To veteran Defra watchers, both Rooker's and Benn's comments looked like a rebuke to one of their own advisers.</p> <p>Defra's chief science officer, Professor Bob Watson, is also director of the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development, a global study of current farming practices and their ability to alleviate world hunger. Its final report was published in April and its conclusions on GM were not positive. There was still too much uncertainty on 'benefits and harms' and a distinct 'lack of transparent communication'. </p> <p>Again, for campaigners against GM the report was a major victory. The claims by biotech companies that GM could be a panacea for world hunger appeared to have been blown out of the water by the largest panel of international experts ever assembled. The sense that the debate was going their way was only added to over the summer, when Prince Charles accused the biotech companies of 'conducting a gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which had gone seriously wrong'.</p> <p>But then came the fightback. Both the environment minister, Phil Woolas, and science minister, Ian Pearson, made public statements demanding a debate on the virtues of GM foods. For a long time, it had seemed the debate on GM in Europe was essentially over. No new product has been passed for cultivation by the EU for 10 years: suddenly, though, it was game on.</p> <p>As the arguments raged, The Observer invited readers to have their say. We received hundreds of responses. There were a lot of predictable contributions from supporters of Friends of the Earth or Greenpeace, but there were also many from the academic community. Still, if anybody had expected the discussion to break down along equally predictable lines, with environmentalists on one side and scientists on the other, they were mistaken. The experts were manning the barricades on both sides.</p> <p>As Benn must be all too aware, the debate over GM has become all encompassing. It is about politics and the law, the role of big business and the relationship between rich and poor. But it's also about the science, for in this field almost nobody can agree on anything. And in the middle is the consumer, desperately trying to make the right choices.</p> <p>Dr Michael Antoniou was one of those scientists who contacted The Observer. As head of the Nuclear Biology Group at Guy's Hospital, and a one-time member of the government's advisory group on GM foods, he knows a lot about genetic modification. 'In our research into therapies for diseases such as multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis, we work with genetically modified organisms all the time.' It is because of that experience that he believes GM foods are potentially very dangerous.</p> <p>The problem, he argues, is the unintended consequences of genetic modification. 'It's a highly mutagenic process,' he says. 'It can cause changes in the genome that are not expected.' So far, biotech companies such as Monsanto have brought to market only four crops - maize, soya, oil seed rape and cotton - with a limited set of modifications, like pest or herbicide resistance, so weeds can be eradicated without damaging the plants. 'These crops that have come along seem to be doing what they claimed they would be doing,' he says. 'The question is what else has been done to the structure of that plant? You might inadvertently generate toxic effects.'</p> <p>The answer, surely, is that the regulatory regime is there to catch these things. No, Antoniou says, because it is not based on detailed genetic studies or even animal feeding tests. It is based on the doctrine of 'substantial equivalence', in which the original plant and its GM version are compared and, if found to be similar, passed as suitable for cultivation. It is, he argues, like comparing a conventional and nuclear weapon of the same yield and deciding they are substantially equivalent because of their explosive power.</p> <p>The most obvious response is to point out that in America, where more than 90 per cent of all soya is now GM, people have been eating the stuff for years, with no adverse effects. 'That,' he responds, 'is only because nobody is looking at what the effects might be.' In short, he considers GM a risk because nobody knows what it might be doing. Later he sends me complex academic papers on unintended consequences in GM crops. They do appear to establish mutations along the genome, but, again, the researchers cannot say for sure what the consequences of those mutations might be.</p> <p>Vivian Moses is sure he knows. A visiting professor of biotechnology at King's College London, and a member of CropGen, a pro-GM lobby group, he is experienced in arguing over the science. 'It's simply not true that there are mutations all over the genome,' he says. 'There was a paper published recently which looked at this. They found that the changes were specifically where the researchers intended them to be.' </p> <p>In any case, Moses says, resistance to GM is not merely about the science, but about perceptions of the science. He points out that in the late Nineties, GM and non-GM tomato pur\u00e9es were stocked side by side in British supermarkets for two years, and sold in similar amounts. 'The consumer saw the product and they were not put off.' Then the newspapers started filling up with headlines about 'Frankenstein foods', and the market collapsed.</p> <p>He rages against the culture of what he calls 'catastrophism and protest. There is a cultural problem that some people have. If they don't understand it they bash it.' It does seem that the anti-GM side can be prone to misunderstandings or exaggerations. For example, one briefing paper by the Soil Association referring to the same research papers on unintended consequences in the genome sent to me by Antoniou takes an unproved thesis - that unexpected mutations might cause toxic reactions - and turns it into fact. 'This,' it declares, with impressive assurance, 'explains why GMOs have been associated with allergic reactions.' When it doesn't explain anything of the sort.</p> <p>Likewise, in the late 1980s an outbreak in the US of the auto-immune illness Eosinophilia-Myalgia syndrome was associated with a GM version of a protein food supplement called tryptophan. The episode resulted in deaths and injuries, and is held up as the definitive example of the damage GMOs can do, despite the fact that the scientific consensus insists the genetic modification had nothing to do with it. And yet anti-GM campaigners point to it as proof while also occasionally inflating the number of deaths from the generally accepted 37 to 'around 100'.</p> <p>Most importantly, Moses says, what the oppositionists fail to recognise, indeed refuse to recognise, is that the process of genetic modification in our food crops is hardly unique. Here he is referring to the little discussed mutagenesis breeding programme that took place in the early years of the 20th century. 'Around 80 years ago researchers began to irradiate seeds and treat them with carcinogenic chemicals in the expectation they would cause mutations, some of which might be useful.' Many of these experiments produced seedlings which were useless, but a significant number were successful. 'About 70 per cent of our current crop plants have such an event in their history. Organic farmers use them by the bucket load and nobody bats an eyelid.'</p> <p>Mutagenesis breeding was haphazard. By contrast, GM processes are, he claims, very precise. He also points out that conventional plant breeding is more than capable of producing a toxic plant, like a potato with a deadly cargo of glycoalkaoids. The difference is that conventionally created plants don't need to undergo any kind of testing regime, whereas GM foods do. But isn't that testing regimen - substantial equivalence - lacking in rigour? 'The industry provides the evidence that satisfies the regulators. But biotech companies are not responsible for chasing up every wacky idea thrown its way by the anti-GM lot.'</p> <p>Moses can't hide his irritation with the anti-GM lobby; in his office at Oxford University's newly opened Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, the government's former chief scientist, Sir David King, comes across merely as frustrated. His whole argument, he says, is informed by his role as the EU adviser on African development. 'We're not starving in this country. We're not short of food. So when I suggest you should try GM tomatoes, the response is \"why should I take the slightest risk?\". It's a very different story in Africa.' He accepts that a lot of the anti-GM sentiment was caused by the bio-tech companies themselves. 'Monsanto marketed the products very vigorously in a way that had worked in the US, but here it caused great resistance and anti-American sentiment.' One of their innovations was to genetically modify a crop so it couldn't reproduce the next year, forcing farmers to restock with seed. 'And they called that the terminator gene. How stupid is that?'</p> <p>It's certainly the case that Monsanto's practices - vigorously pursuing farmers suspected of illegally planting their seeds without paying royalties through the courts, creating seed 'technology packages' that force farms into a dependence on the company - has engendered a deep mistrust. Many do not like the notion of a multinational corporation owning plant life through patents, a move that only became possible through a change in US patent law in 1980. But that, King says, should not blind people to the benefits. Britain was leading the world in this technology for many years, but a lack of consumer interest has driven companies out of the biotech business. 'The GM campaigners have won a great victory, but the cost to the economy has been enormous.'</p> <p>More importantly, he says, it risks stifling future developments. A regular battleground for both sides is whether GM foods can solve the problem of hunger that affects 850 million people. Anti-GM campaigners point out that there is no evidence GM crops improve yields. They are right; they don't, and there have even been examples of certain crops reducing yields.</p> <p>However, the reality is that none of the GM crops on the market has actually been designed to increase yields. They have been designed to reduce costs by being pest-resistant or requiring less herbicide. Higher yield crops or those that may be drought- or salt-resistant are only now being developed. 'Saying GM research should stop because it hasn't worked yet is a little like saying we haven't yet developed a malaria vaccine, so let's stop working on it. If I were a betting man, I would put serious money on the companies developing these products,' says King.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, this is not an argument that holds much sway with Greenpeace. 'If these products escape and get a foothold in the environment, there's no way of containing them,' says Doug Parr, chief science officer for the organisation. 'With the environment you could even create the problem simply by testing them.' </p> <p>Hence a campaign of direct action, to rip up test fields, the most recent of which took place in Yorkshire this summer, when a field of potatoes genetically modified to cope with a form of pest was destroyed by persons unknown.</p> <p>The environmental concerns certainly deserve consideration, even if, as with so many of the arguments, they remain unproved. The notion that a pest- or herbicide-resistant crop could cross-pollinate with a weed, creating an unstoppable super-weed, remains - for the most part - theoretical. More troubling is the way some GM crops can become so popular they result in a monoculture, as happened with GM soya in Argentina from the late Nineties onwards. 'What it comes down to is, what are the risks we are running through the propagation of GM crops?' says Parr. 'Are they significantly different to those with other crops? I say yes they are.'</p> <p>Why does he think there has been a sudden upsurge in voices speaking out in favour of GM? 'It's very simple. The biotech companies want to have another go at cracking Europe.' After all, if they get Europe onside, not only do they land all those consumers; they also neuter most of the non-governmental organisations and charities that have affected the debate in Africa, where GM foods have been almost completely rejected. </p> <p>Sources in the government say there hasn't been a change in policy, that Tony Blair always saw the benefits and that this view has continued into Gordon Brown's premiership. The only change has been the resignation as science minister in 2006 of Lord Sainsbury who, because of his connections with the supermarket that carried his name, chose not to talk about GM foods at all.</p> <p>So the silence is over and the debate rages. But will it have any impact? Perhaps the answer lies back in the Pankhurst Room at Manchester's Radisson Hotel. After Jeff Rooker had spoken up in favour of GM, the other panellists were invited to weigh in, including Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium. 'We don't sell GM because no one wants it,' Opie said, simply. 'There is no demand for GM products in this country. When I am challenged by people on this, I say, \"If you think there is such a demand for GM, open a store\".' </p> <p>Don't expect to see a rash of GM-friendly supermarkets opening up in Britain any day soon.</p> <h2>What our readers think</h2> <p>Some weeks ago, in preparation for this feature, Jay Rayner posted online and asked you, our readers, to point him in the direction of good research on genetically modified foods.

  "<p>Richard Serra's reputation precedes him: he is cerebral, single-minded, austere, as steely and uncompromising as his work. He may indeed be all these things but he is also, it turns out, a great storyteller. One of his best anecdotes concerns his turbulent years as a student at Yale in the early Sixties, where he came of age in an intensely creative milieu that included the artists Frank Stella, Chuck Close and Nancy Graves, a classmate who became his first wife. </p> <p>'I was thrown out of Yale for something real stupid,' says Serra, stern features dissolving into a childlike grin. 'Robert Rauschenberg came up there as a visiting critic. Being a bit sparky back then, I thought I'd see what he was made of. I found a chicken and tethered it to a rope and put it in this box on a pedestal. It was a kind of prank at Rauschenberg's expense, right? But when he lifted the box, the goddamn chicken flew up above him and started shitting everywhere.'</p> <p>You can see that Serra relishes the memory of that rebellious moment even though it almost cost him his scholarship. 'All the students were cracking up, and even Rauschenberg, to his credit, liked the gesture. But the faculty didn't see the joke. I was suspended for two weeks, but it was kind of worth it.' </p> <p>He pauses, still grinning, then says: 'That incident sums up my attitude: I don't give a shit but I care quite a lot.' </p> <p>Next year Serra will be 70. Like all great iconoclasts, he has lived long enough to see his supposed artistic provocations gradually accepted as groundbreaking statements. His towering curves and sheets of oxidised steel are now an artistic signature, as instantly recognisable as Giacometti's elongated figures or Rothko's swathes of deep, dark colour. When he installed his best known work, a series of huge rolled steel sculptures collectively entitled The Matter of Time in the Bilbao Guggenheim in 2005, the art historian Robert Hughes called him 'not only the best sculptor alive, but the only great one at work anywhere in the 21st century'.</p> <p>Serra's work harks back to the American Minimalist movement of the Sixties and Seventies but it often seems to have emerged from a mind in thrall to the industrial age. At times he has seemed as tough and intimidating as his steel plates, and his career has been punctuated by controversy. He once sued the American government when a public art work of his was removed from its site in New York and destroyed. He enraged the American right by creating two posters protesting against the Bush administration and the abuses at Abu Ghraib, which sold in their thousands online. 'I don't consider myself a political artist,' he tells me, 'but anything I can do to make a difference, I will. America is a right-wing country and I'm essentially from the old left.'</p> <p>Age has not withered him, nor dented what he calls, only half-jokingly, his 'sceptical negativism'. When I ask him to describe his sensibility he says: 'I have a certain obstinacy, a certain wilfulness that has got me in trouble but it has also got me through.' </p> <p>Walking into the Gagosian Gallery in King's Cross, you see immediately what Robert Hughes meant when he wrote that Serra's achievement 'has been to give fabricated steel the power and density... the sense of empathy and urgency and liberation that once belonged only to bronze and stone'. The Gagosian show is called simply Sculpture, a title that does little to prepare you for the way Serra radically transforms any context in which he places his giant steel curves. The monumental weight of these burnished sculptures is tangible as soon as you enter the space. Though big and airy, it seems barely able to contain them. </p> <p>In the main gallery there are two huge curved circles of oxidised steel, one convex, the other concave. The second is the exact inverse of the first but the experience of walking along - and around and through - each is radically different. One looms above you, the other seems in danger of falling away. One is womb-like in its sense of enclosure; the other seems to draw all the light into its centre. They seem, for all their epic tonnage, to defy logic as well as gravity. </p> <p>'Those two pieces are collecting the space in certain ways,' Serra tells me when we meet at the gallery. One suspects he could talk all day about the abstract geometry of spheres, reversed curves and torqued ellipses. 'In one, you sense the volume moving out like a giant flowerpot, or moving in like a giant lampshade. It's all about centralising the space in different ways. How people move in relation to space, that's essentially what I'm up to.' </p> <p>In an adjacent room he has installed a towering steel wall, 10 inches thick, which stands, squat and uncompromising, in the centre of the rectangular space. Like many Serra sculptures, it looks as if it might topple over with enough people leaning against it. (A rigger was crushed to death during the installation of a Serra piece in the early Seventies.) You realise, when confronted with a sculpture of such formal simplicity, such literal and metaphorical weight, that, for or all its familiarity, Serra's work still intimidates. There is something almost Orwellian about this piece, though he has named in it in honour of Fernando Pessoa, the elusive Portuguese author of a meandering, semi-mystical novel called The Book of Disquiet. He says the connection is tangential: he was reading the book while making the piece, and cautions that 'one should not read too much into my titles'. (In the past he has dedicated work to Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, the German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder and the art critic David Sylvester.) The Pessoa piece is powerful; it brings to mind foundries and shipyards as well as the Berlin Wall and the Israeli-built security fence that snakes though Palestine. You can see why it might cause consternation to those who prefer art to be in some way uplifting. </p> <p>In the Eighties Serra created one of the most controversial works of public art of the 20th century, a curved wall of steel entitled Tilted Arc . It stood, 12 feet high and 120 feet long, in Federal Plaza in Manhattan for just eight years, while local opposition reached such a pitch that, after a combative public hearing in 1985, a jury voted that the piece should be dismantled and removed. Serra sued the federal government over the issue of ownership but, after a protracted and bitter court battle, lost his appeal. In May 1989 the piece was cut into three parts and consigned to a New York warehouse where it has languished ever since. </p> <p>'I don't think it is the function of art to be pleasing,' a bruised but bullish Serra said at the time. 'Art is not democratic. It is not for the people.' His attitude did little to endear him to the New York public, even as the contemporary art world rallied around him. </p> <p>Soon afterwards he found himself in another rancorous dispute over a big steel piece commissioned for the Sculpture Hall at Yale University. One incensed academic wrote to the local press claiming, 'Serra's pieces are about as communal as the walls of a Gulag.' He still bears the psychological scars of those epic battles. </p> <p>'That stuff hurt,' he says. 'I was standing up for a principle. Artistic ownership. It's your work; nobody has the right to destroy it. Now, if you make a work for the American government, they can dispose of it the very next day. It's unheard-of.' </p> <p>For a long time Serra's work was held to illustrate the tensions that surround public art, its funding, its responsibility and its execution. 'Up until about 10 years ago I got a lot of stick,' he says. 'It reached a crescendo of sorts around Tilted Arc. At one point they had posters plastered all over my work with a picture of the Vietnamese guy being shot in the head and a sign underneath that said, \"Kill Serra\". People were threatening to kill me because I was making art in New York City. That's a little bit extreme, right?' </p> <p>Now, older and wiser but still combative, he senses a sea change in both the critical and public response to his work. What does he think caused the shift in attitude? How did he go from, as one critic put it, 'being a steely pariah to New York's favourite sculptor'? </p> <p>He doesn't even have to think about the answer. 'It was the curves,' he says, laughing. 'It was definitely the curves. When I showed the first series of Torqued Ellipses in New York 10 years ago there was a definite sense that people were reacting to the work in a different way. People reacted to the curves in a way they didn't to the angles and straight lines. They hadn't seen that before. Modernism was a right angle; the whole 20th century was a right angle.'</p> <p>Nodding his head as if in complete agreement with himself, he concludes: 'People were ready for curves.' </p> <p>Richard Serra was born in San Francisco in 1939, the second of three sons to a Spanish mother and a Russian-Jewish father. Both his parents were left-leaning and he remembers two of his uncles, who worked on the piers, shooting at each other in a long-running row over union politics. 'It was a lively environment,' he laughs. 'I grew up poor but the atmosphere was rich. There always seemed to be political discussions in the house, debates about what sort of life you should live. Where you come from confers meaning on what you do, and that's how it was for me, I guess. I'm single-minded, that's for sure.' </p> <p>He inherited his single-mindedness, he says, from his mother, who steered all her sons into higher education. His brother Tony has since made a name for himself as one of San Francisco's most radical attorneys, famously defending the Black Panther leader, Huey Newton, as well as the late-Sixties urban guerrilla group the Symbionese Liberation Army, who kidnapped the heiress Patty Hearst. </p> <p>At Yale, where he studied painting and paid his way by working in a steel mill, Serra seems to have taken most of his inspiration from the artists who taught there. He singles out Philip Guston and the experimental composer Morton Feldman as 'guiding lights' who, he says, 'didn't try and lay their shtick on you'. </p> <p>After the Rauschenberg spat, a Fulbright grant took him in 1964 to Paris, where he visited Brancusi's studio and hung out nightly at the cafe La Coupole, waiting for glimpses of his hero, Alberto Giacometti. The great sculptor 'would turn up for a drink late at night with plaster in his hair'. He later described both artists as 'empowering figures'.</p> <p>Serra's 'big epiphany as an artist' occurred when, on a fleeting visit to Spain, he saw Velazquez's astonishing painting Las Meninas for the first time. It is a group portrait, in which the artist has placed himself in the background, poised at his easel, his gaze directed back out at the viewer. 'I was still very young and trying to be a painter, and it just knocked me sideways,' he says. 'I looked at it for a long time before it hit me that I was an extension of the painting. This was incredible to me. A real revelation. I had not seen anything like it before and it made me think about art, and about what I was doing, in a radically different way. But first, it just threw me into state of total confusion.' </p> <p>For a while afterwards, he made some very odd installation pieces deploying a variety of stuffed animals and, in one instance, a live pig. He was lost, he says, but on his way to reinventing himself as an artist whose work would hinge on the idea of 'the viewer being the subject of the piece'. He says he is still grappling with to that idea today. 'In my later work, the person who is navigating the space, his or her experience becomes the content. So, the whole subject-object relationship is reversed. The content is you! If you don't walk into the work and engage with it, there isn't any content. That's really what I've been dealing with ever since I saw the Velazquez painting.'</p> <p>In mid-to-late Sixties New York, Serra became part of a small but enduringly influential downtown underground art scene that included Chuck Close, the writer Spalding Gray and the minimalist composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich. He mostly hung out with dancers from the Judson Church group, including Yvonne Rainer and Serra's one-time partner Joan Jonas. 'The dancers were the real radicals. They taught me more about space and movement and gravity than anyone else.' </p> <p>To fund his art, Serra started a furniture-removals business, Low-Rate Movers, and employed most of his struggling friends. For a while Philip Glass worked as his assistant, helping him install shows and lug furniture up and down the steps of brownstones. 'It was an extraordinary time, idealistic, communal, generous. I suppose it was a kind of radical underground scene insofar as we rejected the mainstream. If you sold out a show it was as if you'd actually sold out. Everyone would commiserate. The way we saw it was that if the dealers and the collectors liked the work it couldn't possibly be radical.' </p> <p>He shakes his head and a wry grin spreads across his tough-guy face. 'It was the exact opposite of now. These days it's all about selling, all about the market value. Some time in the Eighties artists became Hollywood-style stars. The personalities started to take precedence over the work.'</p> <p>In 1970 Serra helped his close friend the late Robert Smithson to 'lay out' Spiral Jetty, Smithson's seminal earthwork that coils out into the Great Salt Lake in Utah. 'When Robert died,' he says, 'I felt like I had lost a brother. He was a guy I could get dead drunk with, and have a huge fight with, then wake up in the morning and straight away be friends with again. I still miss that deep connection we had.' </p> <p>Serra has been married for 30 years to Clara Weyergraf, and they divide their time between Tribeca, New York and Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. When he was recently made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters of the French Academy, the City of Paris restored one of his earlier works, Clara Clara, to its original site in the Tuileries gardens. But this work has also become problematic, having since been marked around its base by the dusty footprints of lounging youths. 'It bothers me a lot the way they put their feet on it,' Serra told the New York Times recently. 'But I haven't gone up to anyone to pull them away.'</p> <p>Like the great American novelist Philip Roth, who possesses a similarly sceptical, combative sensibility, Serra has greeted the onset of old age with a burst of renewed creative intensity. There have been two big shows, last year's 40-year retrospective at Moma in New York, and this year's opening exhibition for the Monumenta event at the Grand Palais in Paris. </p> <p>'Man, that was a tightrope walk,' he says. 'There was no way to mock it up, so vast was the space. We didn't know if the piece would work until the first plate went up. It was one of the most glorious experiences of my life when I saw that it was working. It was probably the first time I thought I had done something that was better than me as a person.' </p> <p>Serra's own artistic monument may well turn out to be the epic work that is the centrepiece of the Guggenheim collection in Bilbao. The Matter of Time is the only artwork inside that competes in scale and ambition with the Frank Gehry-designed building, and is a kind of formalist corrective to Gehry's extravagant exterior. </p> <p>The way Serra's work takes on, and alters, vast exhibition spaces like the Bilbao Guggenheim and the Grand Palais makes you wonder why he has never been commissioned to make a site-specific piece for the Turbine Hall in Tate Modern. I can think of no other living artist whose work would make such perfect sense in that cavernous space. When I mention this he falls momentarily silent. 'I'm not saying anything,' he says, 'but I'm happy for you to say it.' </p> <p>For all his epic battles with the public, the art establishment, and even the US government, Serra seems finally to be mellowing, perhaps realising that his singular body of work can speak for itself. </p> <p>\u2022 Richard Serra: Sculpture runs until 20 December at the Gagosian, London WC1</p> <h2>Life in brief</h2> <p><strong>Early life</strong></p> <p><strong>1939 </strong>Born in San Francisco, the second of three sons to a Spanish mother and a Russian-Jewish father, who was a shipyard pipe fitter. </p> <p><strong>1964-6 </strong> Works in steel mills to support himself while studying Fine Art at Yale.</p> <p><strong>1964</strong> Goes to Paris with his friend Philip Glass.

  "<p>The bike was hanging off the railings, a metre or so above the ground, gleaming spectrally in the dusk. It was painted white and its luminosity emphasised the simple sweep of the frame, the elegance of its engineering. Only up close could you see that it looked so stark and sculptural because all the extraneous bits - chain, brake cables, the rubber on the handlebars and pedals - had been stripped away. It was only the skeleton of a bike and there was a plaque hanging off the crossbar: 'In memory of Smudge, 1971-2008.'</p> <p>When I first noticed it, I had no idea this bike was part of a viral campaign of memorialising that had started five years earlier and has since surfaced in more than 50 cities, from Vienna to S\u00e3o Paulo, Whangerei to Toronto. But in subsequent weeks, I spotted two more skeletal white bikes within a few miles of the first, commemorating the deaths of cyclists on the streets of London. </p> <p>In the past year, ghost bikes have appeared in Wales, Oxford, Brighton and York, as well as in the capital. Many are the work of cycling groups that want not only to remember the dead, but to draw attention to the vulnerability of cyclists; bikes as both a shrine and a political statement. Not all cyclists are in favour, however; some argue that they give the impression cycling is more dangerous than it is.</p> <p>Within half an hour's bike ride from my house, I can see three, which seems a scary amount of death on two wheels. Yet that impression is not borne out by the facts, even taking into account two highly publicised fatalities in London in the past fortnight. (Both involved lorries, which are implicated in the overwhelming majority of cycling deaths in the capital.) Since 2000, cycling in London has doubled, but there are 19 per cent fewer deaths than in the mid-1990s, an average of 20 a year. Nationally, 136 people were killed cycling in 2007 and 146 the year before.</p> <p>Some ghost bikes are temporary - the Oxford and York bikes have gone and one in Greenwich Park, south east London, was 'reluctantly removed after a month' following discussions with the Royal Parks. Some local authorities are more tolerant - the Brighton bike has been in place for nearly a year, while Transport for London, which controls the major routes in the capital, says: 'We wouldn't expect to be asked permission for a ghost bike and we wouldn't seek to remove it.'</p> <p>The ghost bike for Smudge was locked to the railings on the corner where he died by friends, who tend it with fresh flowers. A laminated order of service is attached to the frame and a photograph to the front wheel, from which you learn that Smudge's real name was Antony Smith, that he came from Clitheroe, Lancashire, and had a nice smile. They played Joy Division's 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' at his funeral. On the front of the order of service, it said: 'You hold your child's hand for a while, but you hold his heart for ever.'</p> <p>Other ghost bikes are left by family, like the one in north Wales that Peter Cawley set up recently to commemorate his brother Barry, 37, killed by a speeding car in July 2000. Some are installed under cover of darkness, as if they had washed up through the traffic of their own accord; others with a small ceremony, as when Greenwich Cyclists, which is campaigning to ban cars in Greenwich Park, kept a minute's silence for Lennard Woods, killed there in June 2007, which was attended by his wife and daughters. </p> <p>The dispersed, viral and largely spontaneous British ghost bike phenomenon has its origins in St Louis, Missouri, where, in 2003, a young man called Patrick Van der Tuin saw an SUV hit a woman in a cycle lane. Later, under cover of darkness, he placed a white bike at the scene with a notice saying: 'Cyclist struck here.' Passing it each day, Van der Tuin was impressed by the effect his installation seemed to have on drivers: they were slowing down, taking notice. So, one Sunday night, he and a few other enthusiasts set out after dusk with 15 twisted cycles on their bike racks. Stopping at intersections where they knew cyclists had been hit, they locked them to street lamps and signposts and moved on.</p> <p>The idea of the white bike as a haunting symbol was already in the air: in April 2002, San Francisco-based artist Jo Slota had begun painting abandoned bikes he found on the streets, documenting the results on his Ghost Bike website. Between 2002 and 2005, Slota painted 23 broken bikes - sometimes a complete frame, sometimes a lone wheel left pathetically propped in a rack. 'I see them as \"dead bikes\",' he said, 'and paint their remains to emphasise their ghost-like quality.' Initially, he resented cycling activists appropriating his guerrilla art tactics and ghost bikes name, although he now feels flattered that his idea has proved so potent and adaptable.</p> <p>The bikes arrived in Britain when Steve Allen, a website designer and keen cyclist, heard that 23 activists in Seattle had spent three months collecting online submissions of cycling accidents, not necessarily fatalities, and had mapped them on a website. In August 2005, the Seattle group placed 40 ghost bikes at the worst locations, each with a notice saying: 'A cyclist was struck here.' They refused to reveal their identities, claiming they wanted to keep the focus off individuals and on road safety.</p> <p>Allen developed a UK version of the site, with the initial aim of mapping dangerous intersections and marking them with white bikes, rather than commemorating the dead ('We don't put out the bikes; other people do that'). But the focus of the website has since shifted, mainly in response to the impact of ghost bikes in New York. </p> <p>There, a group called Visual Resistance, which specialises in politically engaged street art, started creating ghost bikes to mark the 20 deaths on average a year in the city. Their campaign was aided by tolerant city authorities and 45 ghost bikes are still in place in New York's five boroughs. They have now become the responsibility of the Street Memorial Project, a coalition that also campaigns for pedestrians. </p> <p>'The instinct has been to treat these crashes as akin to weather, as something we can never change,' says spokesman Wiley Norvell. 'Ghost bikes defy that convention. They make people aware of the individual who has died. And they work as visual, artistic traffic calming.'</p> <p>The New York bikes have become a powerful symbol. In residential areas, they are visited every day, supplied with fresh flowers and regularly repainted. They have also become a poignant focus for campaigning. On the first Sunday in January, cyclists organise a memorial ride taking in all of them and installing new ones to mark deaths in the preceding 12 months.</p> <p>The British ghost bike phenomenon remains much more diffuse and less well understood. A memorial to James Foster in Essex Road, on the Hackney-Islington border in London, has recently been vandalised; it is now missing its front wheel, pedals and handlebars and hangs off its post looking battered and lost. James's friend Sarn Baggett, who built it out of spare parts at Mosquito Bikes, where he and James both worked, says all the components were unusable. Perhaps the vandals didn't understand the bike's significance, although it is also possible that people in London are simply less civilised and sympathetic than those in New York.</p> <p>James, who was 37, was pushing his bike across the road when he was hit by a car driven by 24 year-old Sabrina Harman. She was over the drink-drive limit and speeding and had a previous conviction for drink-driving. She had been banned for a year and still had not regained her full licence. </p> <p>Foster was well-known and much loved among London cyclists. A tall Tasmanian, with long red dreadlocks, he shared a house with nine other Australians and New Zealanders. Baggett remembers him as 'a classic gentle giant with a massive smile', while his friend Therese Kilpatrick recalls 'a quiet, exceptional person who was incredibly generous with his time, who respected everyone'. He loved cycling and skateboarding and anything to do with adventure; he was also deeply concerned about the environment.</p> <p>Steve Allen cites his death as one of the reasons why he wanted to set up the Ghost Cycle website. The idea of a ghost bike, though, was Sarn Baggett's. 'A group of us gets together for a drink every year to remember him and it seemed like a good way of marking the fifth anniversary of his death. At that stage, I'd only seen ghost bikes on websites. I built it, then painted it in a couple of afternoons.' The bike appeared on the street in July this year. When I last spoke to Baggett, he was still very annoyed at the vandalism, but thinking of rebuilding it.</p> <p>Even with the long-term decline in cycling deaths, it seems likely that the numbers of ghost bikes will continue to grow, probably becoming as familiar as the floral shrines to the dead that now decorate the pavements. While campaigners are right to argue that one cycling death is too many, it would be unfortunate if the proliferation of ghost bikes frightened off nervous waverers, because there is quite a lot of evidence that the more cyclists there are, the safer cycling becomes. But if, as activists insist, white bikes grab the attention of motorists, give them pause and remind them to take care, they will mark the past and help safeguard the future.</p> <p>The other reservation sometimes expressed about ghost bikes has to do with the families of the dead. It's all very well for cyclists to erect memorials to their friends, who may have been cycling enthusiasts, but some families want to be left to get on with their grieving. They don't want to become advocates for cycling safety.</p> <p>Alison Swann heard about the ghost bike commemorating her brother, 'in rather an unfortunate way, through the local paper'. James Danson-Hatcher had been killed eight months earlier, at the age of 23. A keen photographer and cyclist, he had spent a spring day cycling on the Downs above Brighton and had been on his way home when he was hit by a car doing close to the 60mph speed limit. The driver was not prosecuted. </p> <p>Despite this less than ideal beginning, Alison has become an enthusiastic supporter of her brother's ghost bike, both as memorial and warning. 'James was a bit of an activist. He was into green issues and he was a very proficient cyclist. My mum and sister and I all agree that he would have thought it was a brilliant idea. Car drivers fundamentally believe they own the roads. They don't have the 360-degree awareness they need. If ghost bikes can help make people more conscious of sharing the roads, they must be good. I think it's rather beautiful, actually.'</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ghostcycle.org\">ghostcycle.org</a></p> <p><strong>James Foster, 36</strong><br><strong>Died July 15 2003</strong></p> <p>James Foster, an Australian who had lived in London for several years, died after he was hit by a speeding car while wheeling his bike across Essex Road in north-east London. The driver had a previous drink-drive conviction and was over the limit. James, who worked at Mosquito Bikes on Essex Road, was a distinctive and popular figure, and the inspiration for the original Ghost Cycle website in the UK. His friend and colleague at Mosquito, Sarn Baggett, built and painted the ghost bike, which was installed on the fifth anniversary of his death. It has since been vandalised. </p> <p><strong>James Danson-Hatcher, 23</strong><br><strong>Died May 4 2007</strong></p> <p>James Danson-Hatcher was on his way home from an afternoon's cycling on the South Downs when he died in a collision with a car at the junction of Devil's Dyke and Saddlescombe Road. The ghost bike was placed at the scene by members of Bricycle, the Brighton and Hove Cycle Campaign Group, who had been calling for a lower speed limit on the road. </p> <p>James's family welcome the bike, both as memorial and protest. </p> <p><strong>Lucinda Ferrier, 33</strong><br><strong>Died June 23 2008</strong></p> <p>Lucinda Ferrier died on the corner of Stoke Newington High Street and Manor Road in north-east London on June 23 2008.

A plasterer and a roadie for Catatonia, who dedicated their last album to him, Cawley was mountain biking with two friends when all three bikes were in collision with a speeding car. The cyclists were travelling single-file, Barry in the middle. His friends survived, but the driver of the car was killed. Barry's brother Peter put the ghost bike at the site of the crash after reading about the idea on the internet.</p>",
  "<p>There may be no apparent connection between the wheeler-dealers of the City, clinging to their jobs through the white-knuckle ride of the credit crunch, and the legs of the ladies of Hertfordshire; but the momentous events of the past 12 months have shown that the credit crunch works in mysterious ways.</p> <p>Jo Banks, who owns the Heart Hair and Beauty Salon in the county town of Hertford, says her customers are saving money in these troubled financial times by postponing having their legs waxed. 'Clients are still coming in, but they really are holding out until it's absolutely essential,' she says. When clients do come in, she says, the credit crunch is now the main topic of conversation.</p> <p>The women of Hertford are far from alone. All over the country, Britain's consumers and businesses are making millions of tiny money-saving decisions like this. Small firms are postponing investment plans and laying off staff; families are phoning for a takeaway instead of going to a restaurant; would-be house-hunters have put the search for their dream home on hold.</p> <p>The credit crunch began with banks in the United States that had lent too much, too fast, offloading the mortgages of some of the poorest families in America on to willing buyers in the financial markets, an act that was keenly copied by Britain's profit-hungry lenders. It will end, most experts now agree, in a deep recession, as those millions of tiny decisions merge together as a powerful force, bearing down on the economy.</p> <p>Hank Paulson, Washington's swashbuckling Treasury Secretary, has won the approval of lawmakers for his $700bn plan to spend public money propping up the banks, but it was too late to prevent the crisis spilling far outside US borders. Bradford and Bingley was just one of four European financial institutions that had to be bailed out by their governments in the past week alone. Ireland hurriedly guaranteed all savers' and firms' deposits in a desperate attempt to forestall a run on weak institutions. Greece has taken similar emergency action. Iceland is wrestling with a full-blown financial crisis.</p> <p>Plans for more radical measures may need to be formulated in the days and weeks ahead, but even when the immediate drama of the banks' battle for survival is long forgotten, its impact will still be being felt by people who have never met a City banker or a 'hedgie' and have no idea what a derivatives trader does.</p> <p>Some of the knock-on effects of the turmoil in the City are easy to trace: the smart restaurants in the Square Mile with empty tables at lunchtime; the echoing estate agents' branches in Knightsbridge and Mayfair; and the Ferrari dealers twiddling their thumbs.</p> <p>'Let's just focus on the City, and the job losses there,' says Russell Jones, chief strategist at RBC Capital Markets. 'That is going to affect people via lower house prices, and via the things that City types throw their money at: luxury goods sellers will get hurt, restaurants will get hurt.' </p> <p>In the past fortnight alone, HSBC has announced that it is making 500 of its London-based staff redundant, and beleaguered Swiss bank UBS has laid off 450 people. They joined thousands of staff from Lehman Brothers, whose tearful departure from their Canary Wharf headquarters, clutching cardboard boxes of belongings, was splashed across the front pages when the Wall Street giant went bust last month.</p> <p>But hundreds of miles beyond the champagne bars of the metropolis, the credit crunch is insinuating itself, slowly, quietly, like a sinister virus into the ordinary lives of millions of people.</p> <p>The cheap credit that has been the life-blood of the economy for the past decade is relentlessly draining away - and with it, the shop-till-you-drop joie de vivre that has characterised Britain since the turn of the millennium.</p> <p>House prices are sliding faster than they did in the early-Nineties property crash, eating away at the value of what many homeowners believed was a rock-solid investment. Consumers are waking up to the vertigo-inducing reality that the sense of wealth and security that has kept them flocking to the shops, was, at least in part, illusory.</p> <p>Over the past decade, consumers in Britain have accumulated debts, including their mortgages, worth on average 180 per cent of their disposable income, the highest proportion of any country in the G7 club of rich nations. It adds up to a mountainous \u00a31.44 trillion of personal debt - and economic experts have been warning for several years that it would end in tears.</p> <p>Ever since the credit crisis struck Britain's banks a year ago, they have been pushing up the cost of loans, especially for riskier borrowers, such as those who want to borrow a large multiple of their salary, or a have a poor credit record.</p> <p>The rapid drainage of credit out of the economy has intensified as one bank after another has collapsed or been rescued. The Halifax - whose owner ,HBOS, was swallowed up by Lloyds TSB in a government-brokered rescue three weeks ago - announced this weekend that it is withdrawing many of its mortgage deals from the market and ratcheting up the interest rates on others. The cost of other loans, from credit cards to the car deals on showroom forecourts, is rising, too. The days of cheap credit are over. At the same time, falling property prices are making homeowners feel poorer.</p> <p>This is a pivotal moment that marks a sea change in our behaviour, even in our culture. 'We're very used to borrowing money to finance a great deal of the things we do,' says Jones. 'I think people will be rather chastened by this. I think there's going to be a structural break in people's spending and borrowing. People who have been burnt by this will be less willing to push the boat out.'</p> <p>Jamie Dannhauser, UK economist at Lombard Street Research, agrees that it will be a long time before Brits pick up the shopping habit again. 'It would be unwise to view the recent difficulties as anything other than the beginning of one to two years of feeble household spending,' he says.</p> <p>Rising mortgage costs mean that an increasing number of families are struggling with their repayments. Thousands of others are being forced to wonder, for the first time, after a decade of extraordinary apparent prosperity, what they would do if they lost their job.</p> <p>Sue Edwards, director of consumer policy at the Citizens Advice, which counsels people with financial problems, is not surprised. 'We have been warning of a personal debt crisis for 10 years,' she says. 'We're now seeing an increase in mortgage arrears and people who have problems paying their bills, especially council tax, fuel, water and phone bills. People are coming to us because they've borrowed a lot. They've been just about managing their repayments, then a small thing tips them over the edge.' </p> <p>She says that banks are largely to blame, for tempting even the poorest in society into taking out impossibly large loans. 'A lot of our clients are on low incomes, and the high-street banks and credit-card companies have just been throwing money at them.'</p> <p>There is already growing evidence that shoppers are rethinking their priorities because of their precarious personal finances. Major high-street retailers, such as Marks &amp; Spencer and John Lewis, have reported steep declines in sales as reality bites. Sir Stuart Rose, executive chairman of M&amp;S, says the uncertain economic outlook is weighing on customers' minds: 'They are worried about inflation, interest rates, the equity value of their house - indeed, the safety of the pound in the bank, that's where some confidence needs to come back.' </p> <p>Rose says customers were trading down - a factor that had affected its food business, where sales have slumped. He argues that M&amp;S food still sits at the 'top of the quality tree', but it has had to slash prices to hold on to customers.</p> <p>Tesco chief executive Sir Terry Leahy reports the same phenomenon. Sales of its Finest food range as well as organic products have declined in the past six months as customers trade down.</p> <p>Leahy says that customers no longer want buy-one-get-one-free promotions: 'People want to buy something at a price. We've brought the price of organics down to give it a lift - people want to buy organic through this period, but don't feel they can afford it.'</p> <p>Food discounters such as Aldi and Lidl have been gaining ground on the big four supermarkets, reporting a jump in sales as customers seek out bargains. To win back customers, Tesco has recast itself as 'Britain's biggest discounter', introducing hundreds of products into its UK stores that were originally developed for sale in its eastern European outlets. Tesco also says sales of non-food ranges such as its clothing labels Cherokee and Florence &amp; Fred have slowed. Customers are now thinking twice about just throwing a cashmere cardigan or a CD into their trolley. </p> <p>A clutch of shops has already got into difficulties or gone into bankruptcy protection. Those most affected include retailers linked to the troubled housing market, such as curtain seller Rosebys and MFI, and those riding the shopaholic fashion craze, like Miss Sixty. Hundreds of brides were left tearful and present-less as wedding gift specialist Wrapit folded. Even the Queen's dressmaker, Hardy Amies, is teetering on the brink of collapse, and Prince Philip, perhaps conscious of the new austerity, had a pair of 51-year-old trousers restyled in Savile Row.</p> <p>Travel companies were vainly hoping to defy the crunch earlier in the year, banking that the annual fortnight in the sun would prove sacrosanct, whatever the forced economies households made elsewhere. But the collapse of XL, Britain's third-largest package holiday company, leaving thousands stranded abroad, gave the lie to that, and the summer of 2009 is likely to see even more of us shivering on the beach at Sandbanks or Skegness.</p> <p>Television programmes such as Property Ladder and Location, Location, Location now feel like faintly tasteless relics from a bygone era of easy money, amateur landlords and the quick flip. Falling house prices have torpedoed the peculiarly British dream of making millions from bricks and mortar, and also blown a hole in hundreds of businesses.</p> <p>The number of houses being bought and sold has collapsed: would-be buyers and sellers are simply paralysed by fear and are only moving if they absolutely have to. The days of making quick profits seem light years away; now people are petrified of negative equity or buying before the market hits bottom. Potential first-timers - even if they can get a mortgage - are sitting it out in the belief they will get much lower prices in a year or two's time. Early last year, more than 100,000 new loans a month were approved for homebuyers; by August this year, that had slipped to just 32,000.</p> <p>The buy-to-let phenomenon, which exploded over the past few years as people saw rental income as an alternative to pensions (or even to working), is utterly discredited. It has brought down one bank, Bradford and Bingley, and landlords are struggling to get new mortgage finance when their existing cheap deals expire. Only those who got in on the craze early, and who have built a prudent portfolio, will escape without serious losses.</p> <p>In this straitened environment, estate agents are having to make 'very tough decisions,' according to Miles Shipside, commercial director of property website Rightmove. He means they will be sacking staff soon - if they are not already doing so. Shipside adds that the bosses of many estate agents are now back on the shop floor, personally escorting rare punters around the few homes that are available instead of lurking grandly at the back of the office and letting their employees bring in the commission.</p> <p>'The proprietors are often the ones who have worked through the last downturn. They can spot the debt-, divorce- and death-motivated sellers,' he says. These 'three Ds' are the only reasons anyone is moving house in the current anxious climate, he says. Foxtons, the slick agency that symbolised the frenzy of the boom years in the capital, arranging mass viewings of newly available properties on Sunday afternoons, is now in negotiations with its banks over the repayments on a huge loan.</p> <p>Martin Rose, a spokesman for the National Guild of Removers and Storers, says the number of house removals taking place has dropped by about 65 per cent since last year. 'The first three months of the year are the quietest for removers but after Easter, as the days get warmer, it traditionally starts to pick up,' he says. 'This year it didn't. Business just dropped off a cliff.'</p> <p>Some firms have had to close as a result; many have made staff redundant. So desperate are his members to coax people to hire a remover that they are offering free ferry tickets to France or Spain for every customer.</p> <p>Our misguided reliance on shopping and housing to shore up our national prosperity has been brought to a forcible end. But what of that Cinderella sector, manufacturing? Industry bore up well to start with, and in the longer run there are hopes that the crunch might see a renewed respect for making things. But in the short term, it is suffering badly, too. Ford last week became the latest car-maker to announce cutbacks in output. Workers at the Southampton plant, where it makes Transit vans, have been told they must now work a four-day week.</p> <p>At first manufacturers seemed to be coping; they were aided by a fall in the value of the pound, which makes British exports cheaper. But Steve Radley, chief economist at manufacturing group EEF, says that a growing number are reporting problems. 'The pain is particularly concentrated in industries that are close to the consumer: motor vehicles, electronics. But as the economy really slows, it's affecting companies further down the supply-chain,' he says. 'We are seeing more companies looking to trim their investment plans, and their workforce.'</p> <p>There is no hiding place. No corner or crevice of the UK economy will emerge without scars from this crunch. Unemployment across Britain is rising sharply: the schadenfreude at City bankers clearing their desks will soon be tempered by the realisation that they will soon be joined by a growing queue of others, from every region and every industry. </p> <p>In August, the number of people claiming unemployment benefit rose by 32,500, the fastest increase since the last recession in 1992. David Blanchflower, an independent expert on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, has predicted that more than two million people will be out of work by Christmas, on the government's favoured measure, almost 300,000 more than today.</p> <p>Unemployment is what economists call a 'lagging indicator' - it trails months behind faster-moving danger signals, such as plunging stock markets and house prices; so it may be mid-2009 at the earliest before we see the full impact of current events on the jobless queue.</p> <p>'It's going to spread to all sectors,' says John Philpott, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. 'Some will have to fundamentally restructure, like finance and perhaps construction; but in others there will be a general downturn.'</p> <p>In the space of days, the bank failures have had a profound impact on the national psyche. The collapse of Northern Rock last year seemed at the time as if it could be attributed as much to the recklessness and naivete of its own provincial management as to a wider and deeper malaise. It feels very different now that even bigger, and better-run, institutions such as the venerable Halifax have joined it in the banking sin-bin. As late as a few weeks ago, many people remained blithely confident, particularly away from the febrile Square Mile. </p> <p>Why not? The norm for the past 10 years was for high and secure employment, low interest rates and stable inflation. People were content to run down their savings and run up their credit cards because they were confident they would still have a job tomorrow and the day after that. Pensions, despite the wholesale closure of many employers' schemes, were for many a distant concern. Even after Northern Rock, many were in denial, unaware or unwilling to accept the credit crunch was about to arrive on their own doorstep.</p> <p>Only hours before the demise of </p> <p>Bradford and Bingley, and even as the government was trying behind closed doors to patch up a rescue deal for the stricken bank, shoppers flocked into the grand new Cabot Circus mall in Bristol. The centre, whose flagship store is a branch of Harvey Nichols - home of the expensive designer handbags that in the boom years were on the elbows of modestly paid secretaries as well as models and bankers' wives - is a temple to consumption, with a million square feet of space, 145 shops and 25 restaurants. Its opening celebrations culminated in the performance of a specially written cantata dedicated to the centre and written by its composer in residence.</p> <p>It is the kind of pomp associated with Renaissance princes, devoted to what is, in the end, just a very grand market. The entire south west hopes the venture succeeds, since it is creating 4,000 full-time jobs and is a crucial part of the regeneration of Bristol's centre. But it was hard to avoid the symbolism of this retail Mecca opening as the financial crisis entered a new and more dangerous phase. </p> <p>On Thursday, the Bank of England is widely expected to acknowledge the scale of the threat, by cutting interest rates, perhaps by an unusually large half a percentage point. As the crisis has deepened, the Old Lady has reached for one weapon after another, in a desperate attempt to ease what governor Mervyn King has called, 'these extraordinary market conditions'.</p> <p>King was initially reluctant to come to the aid of credit-crunched banks, which he blames for sowing the seeds of their own demise. But as one domino after another has fallen - Northern Rock, HBOS, Bradford and Bingley - financial services firms have lost confidence in one another, preferring to draw on funds from Threadneedle Street instead. In response, the Bank has repeatedly extended the amount of cash it will lend to them, and the collateral it accepts in exchange - so far to little avail. The cost of borrowing - from one bank to another, and from all the banks to consumers - has continued to rise.</p> <p>There were hopes that US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's $700bn emergency bail-out would help to restore some sense of normality on both sides of the Atlantic; but share prices on Wall Street actually fell after the deal was done on Friday night, as investors fretted that it has come too late to halt a damaging recession.</p> <p>Some US banks have suggested they may refuse to join the scheme, which will use taxpayers' money to buy up 'toxic' mortgage assets, because of the extra constraints placed on it by Congress during a frantic week of negotiations after the bill was rejected last Monday.</p> <p>Even if the bail-out does draw a line under the worst woes of Wall Street, few analysts believe it will bring to a close what King has called 'the great unwinding'. Shocked banks will take years to nurse themselves back to health by trimming lending to fit their newly diminished stocks of assets. Households, too, will have to carry out their own nip and tuck, to put their finances straight. And meanwhile, King and Alistair Darling will have to be on standby to rescue the next casualty. The Treasury has already drawn up a series of radical contingency plans, including the government taking stakes in the major banks, to safeguard them against collapse.</p> <p>Many experts believe Britain is already in the early stages of a recession. Growth ground to a halt in the spring, according to the government's official measure, and a torrent of anecdotal evidence suggests things have rapidly been getting worse ever since. 'There are differences, but it looks to me like this recession will be on a par with the late-Eighties/early-Nineties,' says RBC Capital Markets' Russell Jones. 'It's going to be serious.'</p> <p>House prices usually continue to fall for many months after they peak: in the US, where the boom was not as big as in the UK, they have already been declining for two years; and during the last property crash in the early Nineties, it was more than four years before house prices really began to recover. Even the Nationwide, which has been trying to put a brave face on the downturn, predicts a 25 per cent fall in prices from peak to trough.</p> <p>A recession would mark the close of a golden economic period. Since the Eighties, Britain has clambered up from its sick-bed, leaving the days of sterling crises and industrial sclerosis far behind.</p> <p>Once-forlorn city centres in former industrial centres such as Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle have been confidently regenerated, their job markets repaired and their skylines transformed; urban wastelands have been turned into funky metropolitan hubs. The tide of rising property prices has swept hundreds of miles beyond the hotspots of London and the south east, as second homeowners have snapped up cottages from Cornwall to the Highlands of Scotland, and landlords bought sleek city-centre warehouses to rent to trendy professional tenants. And with sterling riding high against other currencies, Brits abroad made the most of their spending power, flashing their credit cards from Tiffany's in New York to Prada in Milan.</p> <p>Between 2003 and 2007, national income per head - a good measure of economic strength - grew faster in Britain than in any other member of the G7: a proud performance for an economy once written off as a laggard. But we are being starved of the once-plentiful cheap credit that fed our appetite for shopping and property speculation. Our addiction to the high life will be followed by severe withdrawal symptoms. The culture of instant gratification will give way to a long period of painstakingly rebuilding our household finances. Our spendthrift swagger has gone - and it will be a very, very long time before we get it back.</p>",
  "<h2>THE REMORTGAGERS: 'We are having difficulty finding any deals'</h2> <p>Two years ago good friends Emma McMillan, who works for the police, Grace McFall, who works in HR, and teacher Colleen Main bought a three-bedroom mid-terrace town house in Chertsey, Surrey together. Two of the group had split from partners they had been living with, the other was living with her parents, and none of them wanted to rent. </p> <p>The friends put down a 5 per cent deposit on the property and took out a 95 per cent mortgage with Abbey, which came with a 5.5 per cent interest rate. Two years on, they are struggling to remortgage. 'There is definitely a big difference to the last time we looked for a mortgage,' says Emma. 'Then we had a lot of different options; now we are having difficulty finding anything.'</p> <p>Mortgages for those with less than 10 per cent equity in their property have virtually disappeared in the past year and the women's problem has been compounded by falling property prices. They had hoped that the size of their loan in relation the value of their property would have fallen enough to get them a decent mortgage rate, but now they are not sure of whether or not their property is worth less than it was two years ago.</p> <p>'We have done a lot of work on it, including putting in a new bathroom, but we don't know whether it's added enough value to the house to get us a mortgage,' says Emma. </p> <p>'We are scratching our heads about what to do and whether we can put more money towards our mortgage,' says Emma. 'We just hope rates don't go crazy if we have to wait.'</p> <p>Emma has given up smoking to save money and one of her housemates is thinking of bar work to supplement her income.</p> <p>'After reading about it for months, this is the first time the credit crunch has really hit us,' said Emma. 'There is going to be no more going out on Friday nights for a while.'</p> <h2>THE DEBTOR 'Lenders are to blame for making it too easy'</h2> <p>Administrative officer Brian Ockelford, 51, is feeling the effects of the financial squeeze more than many people. </p> <p>Brian is \u00a358,000 in debt to 14 credit-card and loan companies and rising household bills will further reduce the money he has left after repayments. He accumulated the debt over many years through what he describes as 'robbing Peter to pay Paul'.</p> <p>'I would realise I had overspent one month and would use a credit card to pay it off and then, before I knew it, I would be using one card to pay off another,' he says. 'I hold my hands up for letting myself ever get into this situation, but I also think lenders are partly to blame for making it too easy for people.'</p> <p>The debt repayments eventually became unmanageable and earlier this year Brian turned to Payplan, a debt-management company, which has worked out a repayment plan with his creditors that has saved him \u00a31,000 a month. </p> <p>'We now have no access to any more finance and we have to get by on what we've got,' he says.</p> <p>Brian believes that the recent strain on lenders' own purses also means they may not be as lenient about his future repayments. 'Anyone you owe money to now is going to be more impatient than before,' he says. 'I can understand this, but I am worried it may cause problems going forward.'</p> <h2>THE JOB-HUNTER</h2> <p>A recruitment consultant from South Africa, Jane Ward-Able arrived in London three weeks ago and cannot believe the difference in the job market compared with her visit last year.</p> <p>In 2007 she worked as a temp at Lehman Brothers for three months. She came back here to Britain with her husband on 13 September and intended to call her former employer to find out about work; two days later, the company collapsed.</p> <p>'Last year job offers were coming left, right and centre. This year I have more experience and am more marketable, but every recruitment agency has turned me away because they have no jobs. If I had come back six months ago I would have found it much easier to get work.</p> <p>'City banks aren't recruiting people into HR and at the same time there are a lot of people from the banking sector looking for the same jobs as me. I'm at the bottom of the pile.'</p> <p>She has decided to try for a drastic career change - she's looking for work as a nanny.</p> <h2>THE SHOPPER</h2> <p>Fiona Murray, 36, civil servant, London</p> <p>'I don't impulse shop any more. I used to go out at lunchtime to the shops near where I work but I can't remember the last time I did that.</p> <p>'Earlier this year my mortgage payments jumped by \u00a3200 a month. I definitely have less disposable income than before. I switched energy suppliers and cancelled my gym membership and health insurance and that's saved me about \u00a3100 a month.'</p> <p>Murray, who is single and lives in Streatham, south London, has switched her mortgage to a tracker, but is wary that interest rates may not have peaked. She bought her flat in 2006 - a year before the market peaked - and has a considerable buffer before being faced with the dreaded negative equity.</p> <p>'When I do need something, I think more carefully about the purchase.'</p> <h2>THE BROKER</h2> <p>Mark Yallop, chief operating officer of broker Icap</p> <p>Not everyone is hurting. Icap, headed by Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, is the world's largest broker of trades between banks. And business is booming as investors pile out of property, commodities, private equity, the dollar and emerging markets to buy government bonds, gold and other assets deemed safe. 'Volatility benefits us,' says Yallop. 'It means people are keen to trade and that is good for revenue and profits.'</p> <p>Icap expects to grow profits this financial year, which in itself is unusual for a financial institution. But he admits that the past year has been a roller-coaster ride. 'Like many people, I thought that after Northern Rock went down, the first half of 2008 would be difficult, but that by now the financial system would be working more smoothly.' Yallop says he has now watched 10 or 15 'reasonable-sized institutions go down'; he hopes we have reached the bottom. 'But it would be a foolish man who said he knew for certain.'</p> <h2>THE SCEPTIC</h2> <p>Lise Veysey, 36, is a housewife from Frampton Cotterell, near Bristol.</p> <p>'Personally I don't feel particularly affected by the credit crunch yet. I just feel it's all been created by the media. I think it's really just a sense of fear that's being pushed around and that concerns me.</p> <p>'I do find myself buying fewer things, but when I stop and think about it I really think that it has got more to do with all the hype about the credit crunch than my bank balance.</p> <p>'There are obviously a lot of people who are really struggling and I feel very grateful that I do not fall into that bracket. But I believe that people are worrying about it all far too much, and it's just making it worse.'</p> <h2>THE BARGAIN-HUNTER</h2> <p>Caroline Jacques, 36, is an occupational therapist from Ubley, near Bristol.</p> <p>'The media has a lot to answer for. News has a big impact on people's lives and a lot of it really scares people.</p> <p>'A lot of my friends are talking about how they're not going on holiday, but I think we might get a better deal because fewer people are going away this year - I've seen some great deals in travel agents.'</p> <h2>THE WOULD-BE RENTER</h2> <p>Rebecca Mansfield, 18, is a retail assistant who lives with her parents in St George, Bristol.</p> <p>'I used to be quite free with money but now I find myself panicking about it. The things I notice that seem more expensive now are clothes and eating out. I think twice before buying things when I never used to before.</p> <p>'I was hoping to start renting a house with friends but that seems impossible now. It all seems too expensive. I'm getting to the age where I'd like to go on holiday with friends, but now the time has come I can't afford it.'</p> <h2>THE STUDENT</h2> <p>Huma Akram, 18, is a student from Brentry, Bristol. She lives with her parents and works part-time in a shop.</p> <p>'I don't think the credit crunch is affecting the younger generation as much as people who are older or have families. It's easier to spend money without thinking about it when you have fewer responsibilities.</p> <p>'Saying that, I definitely think twice about buying clothes now. I don't know if it's just the media, but when I see a \u00a340 top now I either don't buy it or feel bad about buying it.'</p> <h2>THE ANXIOUS PARENTS</h2> <p>Alan McNaught, 47, is a design engineer from Brislington, Bristol. His wife is Sue Nash, 56, a secretary, and they have six children each.</p> <p>'We're trying not to panic. We're economising by just having presents for the children this Christmas and forgetting about the adults. I think that's when the crisis is really going to hit home, as people go crazy with credit cards at Christmas and then struggle in the new year.</p> <p>'I think the banks have a lot to answer for in terms of giving credit to youngsters. My daughter is constantly overdrawn and every time she reaches her limit they just offer her more.</p> <p>'She works in retail and is always short</p> <p>of cash because she's sucked into buying more than she can afford with her store discount card.'</p> <h2>THE ESTATE AGENT</h2> <p>Marc Goldberg, head of residential sales at Hamptons International.</p> <p>'We estimate that house prices have fallen 20 per cent since the peak last year. I believe prices will drop another 5 per cent.</p> <p>'We have had to rationalise our costs. We have lost 25 per cent of the workforce since the start of the year. I've been in the industry for 25 years and this has been the sharpest, most dramatic fall I've seen. A lot of estate agents have been caught out. There will be 30 per cent fewer estate agents next year.</p> <p>'What's interesting is that in a difficult market, clients value us more. They need us. In the good times, houses go quickly. The prime areas have suffered less falls but we are seeing the first signs now. Houses of \u00a32m-plus have seen 10 per cent falls.</p> <p>'Overseas buyers have been the main driver and they're still buying in the prime areas such as Knightsbridge and Chelsea. It's helped that the exchange rate has fallen. They have seen London representing value, but these properties will fall in time.</p> <p>'All is not lost though. With interest rates likely to come down soon and global efforts to inject liquidity to the markets, next year should be better.'</p> <h2>THE SMALL BUSINESS</h2> <p>Corinne Frydman is director of Webwide Translations, a company based in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, with a full-time staff of two. She also uses</p> <p>about 100 freelance translators, depending on the workload, to reduce fixed employment costs.</p> <p>'We are lucky enough not to have borrowed any money, but have become very careful about getting our money from clients. Even if the client is a huge company, we try to get our money as quickly as possible, for example by negotiating short payment periods. When a bank such as Lehman Brothers goes under, it makes us think that no one is safe.</p> <p>'We are preparing for a recession. However, our industry is extremely busy. We are excellent at what we do, so I am confident we will survive.'</p> <h2>THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE</h2> <p>Paul Walsh, chief executive of international drinks company Diageo</p> <p>'We have a business with many premium brands. Our brands have been around for hundreds of years. They've seen wars, revolutions and many, many economic cycles. They will take this period in their stride and emerge stronger.</p> <p>'There has been an impact from the credit crunch on sales of drinks in pubs, but not sales through supermarkets and off-licences. People have the flat-screen TV, the nice sofa, the decor, and they want to stay in.</p> <p>'The cost of borrowing is rising steeply, even for companies with very strong balance sheets like ours. I know of instances where the banks are scaling back businesses' overdrafts. If that continues and firms can't raise capital any other way, those companies will have to cut jobs.</p>",
  "<p>The title subtly suggests the idea of a quest. Seven days to save a masterpiece for the nation! Seven days to rescue Damien Hirst's reputation! But in fact Seven Days in the Art World is only, somewhat less excitingly, what it purports to be: an account of seven disparate days spent in the excessive and increasingly loopy world of contemporary art. Its author, Sarah Thornton, a 'sociologist of culture' whom the Daily Telegraph once described as 'Britain's hippest academic', visits an auction and a biennale, a prize giving, an art fair and an artist's studio. She also, more weirdly, hangs out at Artforum, a New York art magazine, and attends a student seminar at the California Institute of the Arts in Los Angeles. </p> <p>The result, from her publisher's point of view, is an 'insider' guide to the shadowy types who make, market, sell and buy art. Thornton, however, appears to believe that she has dished up rather more than this. At the end of her book is a brief note in which she explains her methodology. 'Ethnography,' she writes, 'is a genre of writing with roots in anthropology that aims to generate holistic descriptions of social and cultural worlds. Its main research method, \"participant observation\", is a cluster of qualitative tools, which include first-hand experience of the environment, visual observation, attentive listening, casual interviewing and analysis of key documents.' Well, who knew? The rest of us call this journalism. </p> <p>This particular ethnographic odyssey, according to a rather pert video of Thornton on YouTube, took her five years to complete, during which time she interviewed, formally or informally, 250 people, among them Charles Saatchi and Larry Gagosian. Unfortunately, this research is not always apparent in her minute-by-minute narratives ('2pm: time to meet an Italian collector for lunch... 7pm: I'm stuck in slow traffic on my way to Chelsea'). The likes of Saatchi, an extraordinary and fascinating case study when it comes to modern collecting, and Gagosian, a gallerist who is known to protect his artists' stock with a fierceness you might ordinarily only expect to find on a Wall Street trading floor, are not quoted at length in her book, presumably because they insisted on speaking off the record (several collectors who are quoted are given made-up, Tom Wolfe-ish names like Dwight Titan and Sofia Ricci). In which case, why mention, in your acknowledgments, that you talked to them at all? No one likes a tease. </p> <p>Still, Thornton has bagged a few big beasts. Nicholas Serota is here, in all his inscrutable, white-shirted glory and Philippe S\u00e9galot, the art adviser who oversees the collection of Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, the owner of Christie's, Gucci and Ch\u00e2teau Latour. 'Buying is an extremely satisfying, macho act,' he tells her over fish carpaccio and sparkling water.</p> <p>Naturally, most of these people are pretty circumspect about what they say to Thornton, however attentively she listens. Disappointingly, the Rubell family of Miami, the owners of a fairly significant collection of contemporary art, won't let her follow them round Art Basel, the most important art fair in the world: 'That's like asking to come into our bedroom!' Occasionally, though, someone says something pleasingly dumb, revealing or both. At an auction at Christie's in New York, a well-known collector, Juliette Gold (not her real name), incisively analyses why the bidding on a painting by Warhol, Mustard Race Riot, has been somewhat stuttery: 'It's a great historical piece, but it's not a very appealing colour and it's too large to hang easily in one's home.' </p> <p>At the California Institute of Arts, where sessions of group criticism last so long that participating students take naps, get on with their knitting and order in pizza, a student tells her: 'Creative is definitely a dirty word... it's almost as embarrassing as beautiful or sublime.' </p> <p>When she visits the foundry where Oval Buddha, a huge sculpture by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami is nearing completion, she watches curator Paul Schimmel clap eyes on a piece he will shortly put in a Murakami retrospective for the very first time: 'It's either a disaster waiting to happen or it's... brilliant,' he says, gazing up at the 18-foot-high work ('a Humpty Dumptyish' self-portrait, according to Thornton). Then he remembers what he's about. 'In terms of showstoppers, I got lucky. They'll be praying to this thing in 500 years!'</p> <p>The trouble is that the hope of the odd daffy quote is not enough to keep you reading. Newspapers and television are crammed with stories about art, from the latest crazy auction-house prices to the wilful silliness of the next contenders for the Turner Prize (Thornton devotes a whole chapter to the Turner Prize and, for the record, she was able to elicit no more useful information from the 2006 winner, Tomma Abts, than anyone else). </p> <p>To write a successful book about this world, a writer must bring something extra in the way of insight or argument. What Seven Days in the Art World lacks, fatally, is a point a view; a sense of investigation as well as observation; a little polemical verve to pull the reader along. Thornton never adequately explains how an artist comes to be considered worthy of critical or commercial attention. I still don't know why, exactly, the likes of Dwight Titan hanker after Jeff Koons, though Roberta Smith, the powerful and waspish art critic of the New York Times, brilliantly sums up the art of criticism itself when she says: 'You put into words something that everyone has seen. That click from language back into the memory bank of experience is so exquisite. It is like having your vision spanked.'</p> <p>Does ethnography require its practitioners always to favour comprehensiveness over judicious selection? Perhaps. Thornton describes everything: every lunch, every fashion statement ('a petite curator in low-rise black jeans that revealed a hint of midriff briefed the crowd'), every object ('he stared into a well-used cut-glass ashtray') - but never for any other reason than to prove that she was there. A lot of non-fiction being published at the moment seems to be all style and posturing and no hard graft. This book is all graft and not a lot else. </p> <p>What, I wonder, does Thornton really think about what money has done to art? Does its corrosive influence ultimately matter? Most important, when, if ever, will the bubble - so shiny and so seemingly impenetrable - burst? These are the questions I wish that she, or someone, would try to answer.</p>",
  "<p>There can be few writers so adept at catching the American mood as Thomas Friedman. In The Lexus and the Olive Tree, published in 1999, the influential New York Times columnist celebrated globalisation in triumphal fin-de-si\u00e8cle fashion as a process whose end-point is universal Americanisation. The paean continued in The World Is Flat, which appeared in 2005, but by then globalisation was not looking so unambiguously benign and the subtext of Friedman's jubilation was the threat it was posing to the American way of life. One of the book's messages was that the US needed to reduce its dependency on imported oil. </p> <p>American 'energy independence' would allow the US to delink itself from the global market. In this way, the prophet of globalisation seemed to be suggesting, the US could turn its back on the frighteningly unAmerican world that globalisation was actually producing.</p> <p>Friedman's latest book synthesises ideas that have been floating around in America ever since the scale of the disaster in Iraq became undeniable. Supporters of the war believed that once Iraq's oil had been seized and privatised, the price of oil would come down, with Paul Wolfowitz arguing that the invasion would be self-financing and result in a global economic boom. In fact, exploiting Iraq's oil assets proved very difficult, production was lower than under Saddam and the oil price spiralled upwards. </p> <p>At this point, even neoconservatives, who had hitherto looked on green thinking as a dastardly leftist plot, became interested in energy conservation. Not himself a neocon - on many issues his views are liberal, even social democrat - Friedman was at one with the neo-cons in urging a fundamental rethink of American environmental policies. Hot, Flat and Crowded is the result. </p> <p>The book is archetypal Friedman. Breathlessly upbeat in style, seemingly written in a succession of airport lounges, it is a compendium of the bullish delusions of US politics over the past two decades. He instructs the reader in what he calls 'the First Law of Petro-Politics', which says that when the price of oil goes down, freedom goes up. A drop in the price of oil to $20 a barrel will trigger democratic revolutions throughout the Gulf, he believes, and in one sense he is right. A collapse in the oil price would destabilise existing regimes and might well result in a spread of democracy. But in most cases, certainly in Saudi Arabia, which remains vital to Western oil supplies, it would be an Islamist version of democracy, hostile to Western interests, that would come to power. </p> <p>Friedman makes much of the example of Bahrain, where he tells us the prospect of oil running out is leading to democratic reforms. But the upshot of this democratisation is unclear and the so-called Law of Petro-Politics is in general not much more than a formula for wishful thinking. </p> <p>At other times, Friedman is refreshingly realistic. 'Rapid economic growth and population expansion,' he writes, 'are driving the destruction of forests and other ecosystems at unprecedented rate. The destruction of these forests and biodiversity-rich environments, in turn, contributes to climate change by releasing more carbon in the atmosphere.' Here Friedman recognises the interconnections that underlie the environmental crisis and which necessitate a shift in our whole way of doing things. He is robust in recognising that any effective response to climate change must include hi-tech solutions such as nuclear power, although his proposal for an 'Energy Internet' ('one big seamless platform for using, storing, generating and even buying and selling clean electrons') sounds impractical. A large-scale fusion of information technology and energy technology could have many benefits, but in a world of states competing for energy resources, and using these resources as geopolitical levers, there is no prospect of such a scheme operating at the global level. Even so, Friedman's focus on technical fixes for environmental problems is closer to reality than mainstream green thinking, which clings to a utopian faith in political transformation.</p> <p>Friedman's discussion of the environmental challenges facing the world contains valuable insights. Yet in the context of the book as a whole, these insights are almost inadvertent. Hot, Flat and Crowded is only incidentally about the environment. As is always the case with Friedman, its real subject is not the world, but America. The concluding paragraph is toe curling in its parochialism: 'We need to redefine green and rediscover America and in so doing rediscover ourselves and what it means to be Americans. We are all Pilgrims again. We are all sailing on the Mayflower anew.' </p> <p>An Americo-centric perspective of this kind might have made some sense 20 years ago. In today's world, where the US is a tottering power, it is comically deluded. It is not America that will decisively shape the global response to climate change and energy crisis. It is emerging nations, above all China, which is definitely not sailing on the Mayflower. True, Friedman gives China's rulers grudging praise for their environmental awareness, but only on condition that China ends up being more like America: 'They will never say so, but I do not think they can go green without, over time, going at least a little orange - \u00e0 la the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004'.</p> <p>Since that was written, events have altered the picture. Russia's self-assertion in the Caucasus has revealed the geo-political forces that are shaping world politics and the future of the orange revolutions is looking less assured than it did only months ago. More to the point, at least from Friedman's navel-gazing perspective, Americans now have other concerns. The environmental anxieties that followed the Iraq debacle are fading, along with the war itself, from the centre of American politics. The struggle to avert a catastrophic depression is now all-consuming. The American psyche is grappling with a well-founded fear of economic collapse and it is hard to see it being energised by Friedman's green-tinged nationalism.</p> <p>The upshot cannot be known, but as fear tightens its grip, drilling for oil off its coastlines and reopening coal mines may be what the US resorts to. History has moved on, the American mood has shifted and for once Friedman has been left behind.</p> <h2>Global affairs: three to read</h2> <p><strong>The Wrecking Crew by Thomas Frank </strong>(Harvill Secker) <br>A primer on American conservatism, revealing the corruption and self-interest at the heart of the movement that has been the ascendant force in US politics for three decades.</p> <p><strong>The Post-American World by Fareed Zakaria </strong>(Allen Lane)<br>The editor of Newsweek argues that American power may be waning, but this is no bad thing; if the US learns how to broker and mediate, it can remain a force for good. </p> <p><strong>What Next: Surviving the Twenty-First Century by Chris Patten </strong>(Allen Lane) <br>The former governor of Hong Kong identifies and offers 'rational' solutions to the many challenges facing the world, from climate change to drug trafficking.</p> <p>\u2022 John Gray's Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia is published by Penguin</p>",

Ecological sanitation (ecosan) is almost always superior to the plumbed-</p> <p>in thrones through which we expend 4,000 litres of water to wash away the 13 gallons of faeces and 130 gallons of urine we each produce annually (plus, huge amounts of energy are required to run sewage works). The Enviro Loo, a self-contained dry toilet, uses wind and sun to reduce solid waste to what proponent James Young (info@kazuba.co.uk) calls a 'cowpat left in the sun for six months'. The first UK Enviro Loo is now being enjoyed by volunteers on a Lancastrian allotment. The rest of us remain wedded to what sanitation expert Arno Rosemarin terms a 'flush-and-forget system'. The only toilet innovation most of us encounter is the 'low-flush loo', which offers pathetically minimal opportunities to lighten the load. </p> <p>As Rose George reminds us in a new book, The Big Necessity, 1g of faeces can contain 10m viruses, 1m bacteria and 100 worm eggs. Toilets remain taboo, and this has led to global political neglect: 2.6bn people (41 per cent of the global population) have no access to sanitation at all. Each year more than 200m tonnes of human waste and vast quantities of waste water and solid waste go untreated around the world. </p> <p>The sobering fact - articulated in WaterAid's recent report 'Tackling the Silent Killer: the Case for Sanitation' (www.wateraid.org.uk) - is that unless this changes, most Millennium Development Goals will be unachievable. Lack of access to sanitation causes around a quarter of all child deaths in the developing world. </p> <p>In another new book, The Last Taboo, Maggie Black and Ben Fawcett (www.earthscan.co.uk) make a compelling case for ecological sanitation in the developing world, as opposed to pit latrines. The latter - 'the oldest and most widely used toilet in the world' - are prone to flooding and pollute groundwater. Neither do we want to export a dependency on wasteful flushing loos (it's not practical, in any case). We need a revolution in which human waste is viewed not as something we're taught to flush away at the greatest speed possible or flung over a wall in a plastic bag (common in developing-world mega cities, where one-sixth of the global population lives without access to sanitation), but rather captured as a potential resource. With compost toilets, waste drops into a dark hold and a ventilation system pulls air down to prevent odour. In the chamber, the liquid and solid waste separate - the liquid can be used immediately as fertiliser; the solid waste is stored for at least 12 months, then harvested as compost. That's where our pennies need to be spent, and urgently.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"mailto:lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk\">lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk</a></strong></p>",
  "<h2>Relatives should not refuse organ donation</h2> <p>I'm entirely in favour of presumed consent with easy opt-out for organ donation, but am totally against allowing bereaved relatives to refuse organ donation if the dead person has signed a donor card and/or is on the organ donor register ('Consenting to organ donation is the hallmark of a caring society', Focus, last week). </p> <p>I feel that either should be treated at least as seriously as a wish expressed in a will.

  "<p>Gordon Brown and other European Union leaders called last night for a global economic summit to 'rebuild the world's financial system' as they held emergency talks on how to prevent a repeat of the current international credit crisis.</p> <p>At a hastily convened meeting in Paris, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the heads of the EU's four biggest economies - Germany, France, the UK and Italy - were united on the need to call all leading economic nations together to create 'a new financial world just as Bretton Woods did 60 years ago'.</p> <p>The summit, planned for next month, is expected to include the G8 leading industrial nations, as well as India, China, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico. Sarkozy, who called last night's meeting in his role as EU President, said it was time for governments to clamp down on speculators and restore a moral element to the heart of a regime that had failed.</p> <p>'We need to literally rebuild the international financial system. We want to lay the foundations of entrepreneurial capitalism, not speculative capitalism,' he said.</p> <p>As part of a rolling programme of announcements, the EU's 'big four' agreed to release \u00a312bn of emergency aid to ailing small businesses across the EU immediately, and a further \u00a312bn as soon as possible after that. The European Investment Bank had said the money would be released gradually over the next four years. </p> <p>Calling for a more co-ordinated response to the credit crisis, Brown said international co-operation on regulation was needed. 'We are seeing, in addition to the national action we are taking, that these global problems about oil, about the credit crunch, need global solutions,' he said. 'I think in the next few weeks we have got to show how we can do more in Britain and across Europe to help small businesses, as well as households, through what is a difficult economic time but where I believe Britain can lead the way out of the difficulties.'</p> <p>Action was needed, and would be taken, to protect all solvent banks in the EU. 'I want the message to go out from this meeting today that no sound solvent bank should be allowed to fail for lack of liquidity,' Brown added. The meeting's main pledges on restoring sound financial systems will be looked at next week by finance ministers from all 27 EU states during talks in Luxembourg.</p> <p>Germany repeated its opposition to the use of taxpayers' funds to help ailing banks after calls from France for a European equivalent of the $700bn US bail-out agreed on Friday night. Germany's Economy Minister, Michael Glos, said such a \u20ac300bn rescue fund was a non-starter. 'I do not think it can be justified in this situation to ask the state to restore trust that has been gambled away with large-scale debt relief plans financed by tax money,' he said.</p>",
  "<p>Business Editor Ruth Sunderland is correct in noting that the lightness of regulatory touch for the financial markets began with Thatcher and Reagan (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/28/globalrecession.bradfordbingley\">'Now is our chance to change capitalism for good. Let's take it'</a>, Business, last week). Current proposals to solve the financial crises are designed only to repair the system that has created them.

  "<p>Gordon Brown's reshuffle has received a predictably mixed press, though one appointment can be rated as modestly encouraging: that of Hilary Benn as head of the government's food policy. Benn, it should be noted, is a supporter of crop gene manipulation, an intensely controversial technology. Scientists say it could save a hungry world. Opponents, claiming it will cause widespread environmental damage, have ensured that GM crop trials in Britain have been destroyed. Scientists view these actions with disgust. Mr Benn's support for their cause could prove invaluable.</p> <p>The issue is further complicated because campaigners believe GM foods are being forced on the world by biotechnology multi-nationals seeking monopolies for their products. And they have a point. As The Observer reports today, companies such as Monsanto have attempted to set up GM seed technology packages that force farms into a dependence on their products. Such attempts are a matter of real concern. But we should note they are not confined to GM crops. Trying to tie customers to monopoly deals is common business practice. The technology is neutral.</p> <p>In fact, genetic modification offers some promise for our overcrowded, overheated planet and for the nine billion people who will be living on it in 2050. Deserts are destined to spread, water will become scarce and disease hard to contain. GM crops could help alleviate these threats. Drought-resistant wheat as well as rice modified to generate high yields of vitamins will aid the fight against famine, while crops modified to make vaccines against infections such as hepatitis B will help doctors combat disease.</p> <p>This point should not be understated. It may be fashionable to deride GM technology in the West, but for the rest of the world, it has the potential to save millions of lives. Earlier this summer, Leeds researchers, working with Ugandan colleagues in the development of pest-resistant potatoes for the Third World, found their small-scale field trial had been trashed by anti-GM campaigners. The perpetrators of that act are badly mistaken if they think destroying experiments designed to help impoverished people advances the green cause or strikes a blow against global corporations. </p> <p>The argument over GM crops is changing. They may not be a panacea in combating famine, but their development has the potential to save lives. We cannot know the scale of that potential without allowing researchers the freedom to experiment with the technology. Our judgment of GM must be led by science, not irrational fear and vandalism.</p>",
  "<p>We are now several weeks into the weird humiliation that the Republican party inflicted upon us Americans with their choice of Sarah Palin as their nominee for Vice-President. Here we are, at as precarious a crossroad as history is ever likely to offer up, yet there stands Sarah Palin regurgitating George W Bush's 'good guys-bad guys' baby talk. I despair. </p> <p>When I hear her failing to recall the name of a single newspaper she'd ever read, I feel willing to offer up my teenage son as a sacrifice to the Republican party; he could serve in her stead with so much more fluency. When she prattles smoothly yet non-responsively to questions about the war, economics or foreign policy - or when she brightly changes the subject altogether - I want to weep.</p> <p>Palin is a never-ending train wreck of ignorance, inconsistency, outright contradiction and sneering. During her debate with Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden, she chatted up soccer moms and hockey moms, her mom and her pop and, by golly, yours too. She winked and she dimpled and 'goshed' and 'doggoned' it. She gave a 'shout-out' to some third graders in Wasilla, promising 'extra credit' for staying up to listen. </p> <p>Less remarked upon was the substance. Despite the enormous variety of public crises we face, she dismissed virtually all forms of government regulation by invoking 'private contract' rather than collective duty; 'personal responsibility' rather than public oversight; and 'tolerance' rather than civil rights. She misspoke the name of a commanding general, she went unchallenged when she expressed her arch-creationist belief that humanity has had no hand in global warming, tucking all that away cosily but dismissively: 'I don't wanna argue about causes.'</p> <p>Similarly, Palin was unchallenged in her head-spinning assertions about the powers of the vice-presidency, endorsing an unqualified 'flexibility' possibly exceeding Dick Cheney's assertion of a vastly expanded, alarmingly imperial concept of a 'unitary executive'. At the same time, her answers were so vague and addled that it was hard to tell if she actually knew what she was saying.</p> <p>Yet the morning after the debate with Biden, polls showed that the race was still too close to call. If Biden 'won' based on knowledge and experience, it was not by enough of a margin to inspire a significant shift. Indeed, pundits of all political persuasions were dissecting Palin's ability to 'hold her own' as though it were an actual measure of whether she could run the republic. Pat Buchanan, gleeful mouthpiece of the far right, celebrated Palin as 'a fresh voice' with a 'new vocabulary'. 'She tossed away the questions,' he gloated as though this were a good thing. 'She answered what she wanted to.'</p> <p>Presenters on Rupert Murdoch's Fox News channel lined up to decry the way 'we journalists' tend to 'value knowledgeability' while true Americans 'connect to her style'. Greta Van Susteren, an experienced lawyer and ubiquitous television commentator, opined: 'Whether I agree with her or not, the important thing is whether she's plain-talking ... I may have had the fancy education, but I love the plain talk, the direct words. I'm a Midwesterner.' (Whew. Whatever is the value of a fancy education if not to inoculate against such blather?)</p> <p>The enthusiasm for the Alaskan governor reminds me of an exercise I once conducted with students. I played them a segment of the 2007 debate between S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Nicolas Sarkozy. Very few understood French, so it was effectively an exercise in reading body language. They were convinced that Royal had won the argument because she seemed 'emphatic' and 'passionate' and 'repeated her points a lot'.</p> <p>The clip I had played, however, was Royal's least convincing moment in that debate: she was delivering a mawkish, inappropriately long-winded tongue-lashing about Sarkozy's purported failure to tackle the plight of handicapped children. Although her body language might have telegraphed earnest conviction, the words she was repeating with such focused intensity were something along the lines of: 'I am not going to pieces, I am angry, I am angry, I am angry.'</p> <p>Even if one's political sympathies lay with Royal, it was clear why that encounter might have lost her the election. My students accurately translated Royal's passion and conviction. They also accurately translated Sarkozy's discomfort at that moment. But without an understanding of the substance of what was said, it would be impossible to see how much her words contradicted the commanding body language. </p> <p>The enthusiastic responses to Palin's presentations remind me of that exercise. Yes, Palin's delivery is perky and self-assured. But if one pays attention to the substance, it's impossibly vacuous. That so few do pay attention makes me think that listening to the debates must be like a foreign language for some of my compatriots. Perhaps this is laziness or political illiteracy. Perhaps it's a failure of education. Perhaps there's a measure of raw racism: better to vote for anyone other than the black guy. Or perhaps it's a manifestation of gender fundamentalism, by which any biological formation of a woman can stand in for Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>At least as distracting are the polarities jumbling American political discourse: i.e. not just good versus evil, male versus female, black versus white, but eastern elitism versus western frontier spirit; secular humanism versus speaking-in-tongues theocracy; scientism versus creationism; 'tolerance' versus equal rights; ultra-libertarianism versus civic engagement. </p> <p>The Republicans' best operatives have been playing these tensions against each other for decades. Against the backdrop of such a frighteningly incoherent cultural landscape, Sarah Palin plays Mom. She speaks to us in a wipe-your-nose and sit-up-straight inflection that is quite Orwellian - if Orwell had anticipated that newspeak might come packaged as old-fashioned-country-horse-sense speak.</p> <p>And so we love her, Mother Sarah. She's simple, she's pretty, she's as fierce as a tiger protecting her cubs. So what if storms are rattling the windowpanes? We get a glass of warm milk and a big gold star just for staying up late while she tells us reassuring bedtime stories.</p> <p>\u2022 Patricia Williams is a professor of law at Columbia University and a regular columnist for the Nation magazine</p>",
  "<p>It seems they are predicting the worst, gloomiest, skintest Christmas for 30 years. I suppose we're all supposed to think: 'Oh super!' and start droning on sanctimoniously about the evils of conspicuous spending and how, for too long, broken Britain has been riddled with consumerist greed, and weren't we all so much better off in the olden days with little more than a fresh orange and some monkey nuts in our stockings?</p> <p>Well, maybe I'm a bit common, but all I could think was, to hell with that, I'm not returning to the bad old days of golf-ball soaps and slightly crushed talc and flannel sets. This year of all years has been tough - my house is worth about a hundred grand less than I bought it for and I've spent the last 10 months wondering if I'm going to end up living in a cardboard box in the gutter, feeding my children spiders. </p> <p>So forget about downsizing - spend some money on me and then spend some more! Which brings us to the vexed issue: where this Christmas is concerned, will it be a case of cometh December, cometh the class divide?</p> <p>First of all, talk about getting your punches in early. For this is exactly what seems to be happening, with headlines screaming: 'Fears of a tight Christmas'. You can only think, steady on - one hasn't even seen the first robin yet. The retail equivalent, the new Jamie Oliver book, has barely hit the shops. However, just as some people like to get their festive shopping done and dusted by November, Christmas-bashing seems to have started early this year, even before the tinsel hit the shops.</p> <p>One can understand why businesses are alarmed; with consumer spending slowing, banking in crisis and rents rising, the high street has a right to be concerned. Nor does it warm the cockles to hear that the number of households suffering fuel poverty is expected to hit 3.5 million. But this doesn't quite explain why the British public is being encouraged, nay commanded, to embrace our inner Grinch. Well, I say Grinch - the Grinch at least stole Christmas; there are some who just do their mealy-mouthed best to spoil it.</p> <p>Isn't this a mistake? Maybe I'm in the minority but I like Christmas, in all its forms. The family Christmas, the solo Christmas, even the 'Oh my God, why am I working?' Christmas. Just as it was traditional, down my way, to end the week with a life-affirming knees-up, ending the year in a similar fashion just seems right. A shame then that the global economic meltdown seems to have given those who despise Christmas the perfect excuse, a kind of moral Excalibur with which to smite down the plebeian masses who - miracle of miracles - might still, against the odds, be quite capable of looking forward to Christmas.</p> <p>Maybe that's why it's so irksome to be told we're all doomed to have the worst, gloomiest, skintest Christmas ever. It feels a bit like being cursed by the Chattering Class Fairy. We've all met them; we may even have been them. People who spend the best part of the winter months endlessly intoning about how the whole thing has become 'too commercialised'. Their implication is that everyone else is too thick to have noticed. Or perhaps we did, but decided to make peace with it, especially parents, realising that there can be no greater modern pleasure than festively flicking through the Argos catalogue, marvelling at the fab tat you can buy kids these days.</p> <p>This is the problem with the anti-Christmas lobby. They have some good points, but ruin their case with their life-sapping attitudes. They also prove what seems to be an almost unbreakable rule: namely, that the poorer you are, the more fun you're more determined to have. The richer you are, the more fun you're determined to stop. One wonders what their definition of over-commercialisation is. For the vast majority of Britons, their wildest festive dreams probably already peak at a carton of Belgian chocolates, some presents for the kids and a few 'Mummy and Daddy drinks' in the fridge. For people like this, the terminally downsized, what could you possibly take away - their paper hats at Christmas lunch?</p> <p>However, the most compelling reason for not getting sucked into any worthy Christmas drear is that it doesn't make sense. When you think about it, surely the only sane response to the filthy year we've all had is the biggest, stupidest party any of us can afford. A chance to remember (loved ones, close escapes, reasons to be grateful), but also a chance to forget (2008). So pull a cracker and stop moaning - Santa frowns upon party pooping.</p> <h2>That's enough pictures of Lily</h2> <p>Does model Lily Cole truly believe that her shoot for French Playboy (starkers save for ribboned pigtails, little girl socks and a big, fluffy teddy bear jammed between her legs) is 'art'?</p> <p>According to Cole: 'Nudity has always existed in art ...' (blah); 'It celebrates the human body ...' (witter); 'It doesn't necessarily debase ...' (doze). Absolutely, Lily, and I'm writing this stark naked, twirling nipple tassels. An unpleasant image, I grant you, but sometimes shock tactics are necessary. Anyway, Cole can talk. On the Playboy cover, she looks dangerously close to something Gary Glitter would use as a screensaver.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer defended Cole's Playboy appearance and so they should. You can't take the moral high ground when another of your models, the beauteous No\u00e9mie Lenoir, spends entire campaigns running around in her scanties. </p> <p>But Lily, gorgeous, alien-faced, high-end Lily, what on earth possessed you? Was it because it was French Playboy (she'd have thought twice if it meant coming into proximity with Hugh Hefner and his rancid dressing gown)? Did they tempt her with the ultimate model-apple of 'edgy'? Whatever the incentive, Cole looks ridiculous.</p> <p>Ironically, there is an art to glamour modelling just as there is to catwalk, which means that interlopers such as Cole will always run the risk of being FWTKO (Famous With Their Kit Off). This is why I feel sorry for Cole. In the Playboy shoot, she doesn't look edgy, wild or 'out there', she looks like what she is - a silly, middle-class girl out of her depth.</p> <p>The whole thing reminds me of when Gail Porter posed for FHM all those years ago and ended up with her bottom superimposed on the Houses of Parliament: the same confusion between risk-taking and exploitation, the same self-justifying embarrassment. Lily should wise up. This sort of caper isn't art, it's soft porn, just as sleazy in its own way as the hard stuff and best left to experts.</p> <h2>The last thing Obama wanted was OJ back in the news</h2> <p>Should we pity Barack Obama? So near to the election, he may just be casting a wary eye at the new OJ Simpson case, where the former baseball player has been found guilty of armed robbery and kidnap.</p> <p>I happened to be in America the day Simpson was acquitted in 1995 for the murder of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman and the white reaction was almost a caricature of shock and betrayal. I have heard from others that the black reaction seemed to be a similar cartoon ('The Juice is loose!').</p> <p>Of course, this is far too simplistic. All over the world, there must have been many white people horrified to hear of certain items of rigged evidence (said to be an all-too-common Stateside practice when the accused is black). Equally, there must have been many black people quietly pleased when Simpson was found liable for the deaths in the subsequent civil trial.</p> <p>However, few would dispute that the 'trial of the century' was one conducted along strict racial lines, and that, for a distinct group of Americans, it was bad enough that a black man married a white woman, never mind slaughtered her. Ultimately, OJ represented an undercurrent in US society illuminated by Harper Lee in To Kill a Mockingbird - an innate fear and distrust, and mythologising, of 'the savage'.</p> <p>That's why Obama may be unsettled. It is not only Simpson returning to the headlines - that most toxic of cultural stereotypes, 'the black bogeyman', is back.</p> <p>How hard has Obama worked to dispel this entrenched racist myth - the big black guy, full of revenge and hate? He has jettisoned preachers, sidelined Jesse Jackson, faced down the Muslim tag and produced a regular guy wife and family. Even if Obama doesn't win, no one could deny that he has loosened the cap for any subsequent black candidate.</p> <p>Then up looms OJ, whose trial so dramatically polarised US race relations. Indeed, there may be an almost karmic symmetry to Simpson finally facing a life-sentence, even if is for kidnapping some sports memorabilia salesmen. But it could be equally argued that having OJ's face plastered everywhere may be a toxic cultural trigger that Obama and his camp just don't need.</p>",
  "<p>The gloomy crypt is all that was finished of Edwin Lutyens' Catholic cathedral in Liverpool. Now, with dissonant irony, it houses a major exhibition of Le Corbusier. Why irony? Generally, because Lutyens was historicist and Corb was anti-sentiment, at least of the historic sort. Specifically, because Frederick Gibberd's 1967 cathedral now above Lutyens is a monument to what most people think they do not like about Corb: abrasive showboating in concrete.</p> <p>With Calvinist precision, the exhibition lays out history. There are fine original drawings and furniture, Purist paintings and models never seen in this country, including one for the Philips Pavilion at the 1958 Expo in Brussels. There is a reconstruction of the 1925 Plan Voisin for Paris, his audacious (some would say barbaric) redesign of the City of Light. There are objets - books, pamphlets and movies shot on the beach at Arcachon. There are even his signature pipes.</p> <p>Wonderful for the enthusiast, as a document it is very thorough, but as an engagement it touches only slightly on the false witnesses, special pleading, conflicts and reversals in Le Corbusier's life and work. For instance: utopian housing designed for workers in Pessac near Bordeaux was hilariously decorated by the same workers who preferred shutters and bargeboards to siphons and pumps. In the days of Postmodern people empowerment, Pessac became a case study in architecture schools. </p> <p>Because he is easy to copy, Le Corbusier has got himself a bad name. But, then, getting himself a name was exactly what he intended. He was born in 1887 as Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret-Gris in La Chaux-de-Fonds in the Swiss Jura. It was surely influential on young Jeanneret's development that La Chaux-de-Fonds is a centre of the watch-making industry and, burnt down in the 18th century, was rebuilt on a meticulous grid pattern.</p> <p>His first buildings were in his home town: Villa Schwob of 1916 is clean, symmetrical, has generous spaces and spare decoration, but only in retrospect can we see how its clarity and boldness hint at what was to come. Simultaneous with bourgeois Schwob, Jeanneret was working on his radical Dom-Ino concept: slab floors separated by slim columns. He soon proposed a 'Citrohan' house to acknowledge the importance the of the motor car's manufacturing processes to his New Architecture. </p> <p>And he changed his name to 'Le Corbusier'. As mercenaries chose a nom de guerre, Jeanneret chose a nom d'artiste for the battle he was going to fight. Scholars debate whether the name was meant to suggest a crow (corbeau) or even corbel, an architectural term. But essentially, it was meaningless: a brilliant bit of personal branding. </p> <p>And, as a brand, Le Corbusier has become one of the most reviled products ever. This is despite or because no one better caught the sense of the 20th century: he was messianic about machinery and exclaimed 'L'avion accuse!' meaning the functional beauty of aircraft should humiliate architects into making buildings efficient, clean and undecorated.</p> <p>He was a designer of profligate originality, a writer with a keen poetic sense, a brilliant self-publicist. Even his signature was designed. Those amazing spectacles have become global shorthand for 'architect'. His books alone qualify him as a major figure. He was an unbending messiah and, by all accounts, exigent, demanding and unreasonable. But he easily passes the standard test of genius: his work continuously evolves and astonishes. 'Je suis un acrobate de la forme,' he wrote. As soon as he had done with concrete, he went on to brick. Horizontality gave way to voluptuous shape-making: in the Lutyens crypt you can stick your head inside a model of his superlative pilgrimage church at Ronchamp. This is a must if you cannot get to Besan\u00e7on.</p> <p>The case against Le Corbusier is simple: he is the most influential architect ever ... but that influence is malign. How did a belief that 'space and light and order' are 'things that men need just as much as they need bread or a place to sleep' become corrupted into desolate Thamesmead or the burning banlieue of Toulouse-le Mirail? </p> <p>Le Corbusier's architectural philosophy was elegant, simple and correct. He wanted houses to be as useful as machines. What we deride as tower blocks he called vertical garden cities, designs which freed up the land. He developed a new system of proportions called 'Le Modulor' based entirely on the human form: it is modern classicism. We are absolutely wrong to condemn him because of asinine politicians responsible for postwar social housing. Entirely lacking the conceptual sophistication of Le Corbusier, Thamesmead is hideous because the penny-pinching government insisted on inept systems of prefabrication. There were government cash inducements to build tall at any price. They forgot about the gardens, the proportions and the art.</p> <p>That was not Le Corbusier's fault. The case for Le Corbusier is simple: some of the most beautiful buildings of all time are his. The Villa Savoie in Poissy of 1931 (a fine model is in the Crypt) is an absolute, world-class, eternal masterpiece. And so too is the 1952 Unit\u00e9 d'habitation in Marseille. This is the most complete expression of his architectural philosophy: an entire city in a single building created by one controlling intelligence. And it really works.</p> <p>Or, to be honest, it really works now that the occupants are graphic designers, psychologists and professeurs. It is the same in Berlin where Corb also built a Unit\u00e9 d'habitation. The Berliner Morgenpost recently reported that a bewildered old lady, the last of the original residents, is being pestered by yuppies who want to move into a valuable Corb original.</p> <p>Charles-Edouard Jeanneret-Gris swam from his little cabanon on the coast at Roquebrune to his death in 1965. They say he was muttering 'life is right and the architect is wrong'.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday October 12 2008. In the article above we inadvertently called Edwin Lutyens Edward. This was corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Tomorrow evening in America, women's football fans will sit down in front of their television screens to watch the draft for the new Women's Professional Soccer league, followed by a live phone-in and discussion on Fox Sports.</p> <p>It is a scenario that women's football fans in this country can only dream of. In England it is still a major coup to be able to watch live games on TV, let alone football discussion shows at prime time. The difference will be more marked still when the US launch their revamped professional league in April, having targeted some of the best players in the world - including two-time Fifa world player of the year Brazil forward Marta - and England stars Kelly Smith and Karen Carney.</p> <p>With the FA's announcement of plans for a summer Super League to be launched in 2010, including central contracts for England players, and Hope Powell's England side qualifying for the European Championships last week, it is a buoyant time for the women's game. But compared with what is going on around the world, is enough really being done to elevate women's football in England?</p> <p>Already Sweden's most successful team, Umea IK, pay professional wages to 75 per cent of their players and rival men's teams in terms of their TV coverage, many of Germany's players have semi-professional status, Holland's new league is tied to and funded by the men's Eredivisie so that women footballers have their playing expenses covered, and Australia's new W-League is fully professional. English domestic football could end up playing a frustrating game of catch up.</p> <p>Sue Tibballs, chief executive of the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation, is measured in her assessment. 'What the FA are proposing is a great first step, but it's a cautious one. They could actually take a few big strides, and then you'd suddenly see the thing taking off.'</p> <p>At the newly franchised Chicago Red Stars, head coach Emma Hayes - former assistant coach at Arsenal ladies - is frustrated by the gulf in ambition between US and English football. She says the English approach to developing the game is 'Victorian'.</p> <p>'Working in women's sport in England is so hard, it's draconian,' says Hayes, who reluctantly left Arsenal at the end of last season fearing a dead end in the domestic game. 'Arsenal is my club and I love it more than anything else, it's in my blood, but I want to be the best coach in the world and that's why I came here. This country loves women's football. Loves it.'</p> <p>While Hayes welcomes the FA's announcement, she is concerned the proposals will not do enough. 'If we're going to do it let's do it properly with long-term intentions and not just knee-jerk reactions to a few players being targeted by another league. I hope the FA get their act together. They have enough money to do it, they just don't want to consider financing it.'</p> <p>The current proposals will cost an estimated \u00a31m-\u00a32m a year including central contracts at around \u00a316,000 per player, although this last figure is unconfirmed by the FA. It is a modest outlay for an organisation with an annual turnover nearing \u00a3240m and a pittance compared with WPS budgets of around \u00a31.5m per club, plus the added benefit of sharing facilities and costs with Major League Soccer clubs.</p> <p>The introduction of salaries for England players is a huge development - with many top footballers currently paying to play - but Hayes says it falls short. 'Yes it's great they're supporting national team players but is it really viable? Why would [England footballer] Rachel Yankey give up her business interests [coaching schools] for \u00a316,000? And what about the other players who won't be paid?'</p> <p>The salaries are part of an incentive to keep young talent in the game as well as preventing England's best players from being lured Stateside. The words 'danger' and 'threat' have been on everybody's lips after WPS approaches, and when Kelly Smith admitted being open to a return to America - she played for Philadelphia Charge in 2001 under the previous WPS incarnation - feathers were ruffled.</p> <p>But Hayes believes the focus is all wrong. 'Their initial reaction is they don't want to lose players, but it's great that women footballers are in positions of choice, it's improving the game worldwide. That should be the bigger picture. You can't have a stranglehold on players.'</p> <p>WPS commissioner Tonya Antonucci says she expects English football fans will be 'delighted' to see their players competing in the new league.</p> <p>'It's an opportunity to watch great soccer first and foremost, but we're also providing a platform for players to improve their games and to grow the sport as a whole.' Antonucci says the league should act as a 'beacon' for the rest of the world, and could include international club competitions in future.</p> <p>The global approach seems to have bypassed domestic football here. The English league is not attracting players from outside the British Isles, European footballers don't want to come here, and players outside the EU cannot come because of immigration laws and the non-professional status of clubs. Hayes believes this must change. 'I get approached all the time by quality American footballers who would love to play in England, but we're losing them to Finland and Sweden. We should be challenging that legislation, or finding a way around it.</p> <p>'I want to come home at some point,' says Hayes, 'I really do. But I'm here to improve my country and I want to learn everything I can before I return. I just wish that same learning intention was adopted back home.'</p> <p>After a meeting between the FA and women's Premier League clubs yesterday, an FA spokeswoman said: 'This is the start of something really exciting for women's football in England. We have a well-thought-out approach, not a knee-jerk reaction. We have done a lot of research and this is the start of a four-year strategy for women's football.'</p>",
  "<p>Martin O'Neill gives a typically wry assessment of Aston Villa's excellent start to the season: 'What we've done so far is like playing three decent holes in golf. You want another 15 before you've got anything to talk about. I don't know why I've thrown that in because I'm hopeless at golf. I don't think I've ever played three decent holes, certainly not consecutively.' </p> <p>It is easy to see why players respond to the Villa manager. His humour, his unpredictability, his compelling powers of communication, make the fact that he demands an inordinate amount of work completely palatable.</p> <p>There are no magic wands behind Villa's place near the top of the table - just one point off the lead at the start of the weekend. Instead there is an ethic at the club that comes from the top and has rubbed off on every player who travels to work each day at Bodymoor Heath.</p> <p>Brad Friedel is 37 years old and has seen plenty in his career, but O'Neill has created something that has made a big impression on him since he signed in the summer. A smart signing that was, too. 'Martin seems to have this knack of getting the best out of all the players,' the American goalkeeper said at the launch of Fifa 09. 'A lot of managers can't do that. From what I have seen the whole squad go out and work as hard as they can every day.</p> <p>'When it comes to match day all the players back each other. It is refreshing to see. That doesn't always happen in football. People get selfish.</p> <p>'Obviously I have only been with him a short time but what I experienced when I was playing against his sides over the years is you never have an easy game against one of his teams - well I never did anyway. You won't see too many in this team not giving their all. That is a great attribute to have because you can win a lot of points on team spirit alone.'</p> <p>Three today are a possibility as Villa visit Stamford Bridge feeling strong enough to trump whatever Chelsea can throw at them. Last season's encounter was memorable enough: a breathless 4-4 draw on Boxing Day, with Villa playing half the game with 10 men and equalising with a 90th-minute penalty.</p> <p>Chelsea's 85-game unbeaten sequence at home impresses, but does not daunt, O'Neill. 'Their record is astounding because they are not playing secondary opposition. But at some stage it will end. We're going to try and win. It's not an idle boast, it is something we feel on the day we are capable of doing.' Maintaining a blend of ambition and perspective is something O'Neill is drilling into his team, especially the young ones.</p> <p>'We could go to Stamford Bridge and get turned over and people will say we were a flash in the pan, but that's not my view at all,' O'Neill says. 'By the same token we could go there and win and that would give us great confidence, but it wouldn't mean we had cracked it yet. We're making progress. We're pleased we qualified for the Uefa group stages, but the top four have gone well past that.</p> <p>'The gap to the top four is big, really big, and what Manchester City seem to be about to do might put paid to a lot of things. Instead of being a top four it looks as if there could be a top five. We'd have to compete strongly to be up there but there's no point being in the league without ambition.'</p> <p>With Villa's free-scorers John Carew and Gabriel Agbonlahor understandably attracting headlines, the team's defensive resilience has been largely overlooked. But the majority of Villa's summer spending was geared towards the defence. If most successful teams are built upon a solid base, then Villa's effervescent start is all the more remarkable because the back line are only just getting to know each other.</p> <p>'Since the start of the season, three of the back four and myself are effectively brand new,' Friedel says. 'Curtis Davies was here last year but he sustained an injury. For the five of us as a unit these are the first games we have played together. Considering we are all still learning about each other we have started very strongly. I rate this defence very highly.' Tellingly, the back line have remained unchanged so far season in the Premier League - always a good sign.</p> <p>As Ashley Young says, everybody is chomping at the bit to be on the team sheet. 'Nobody is going to volunteer for a rest,' he says. 'When you are playing for a side doing really well everybody wants to be a part of that.' Villa are keen to reward Young for his improvements with a new contract.</p> <p>O'Neill is understandably keen to keep his fresh team together long enough to reap the rewards. 'Odious comparison it might be but Sir Alex mentioned something about [Cristiano] Ronaldo and it not being the right time for him to move. If we can keep progressing I'm hoping we would be capable of withstanding that sort of pressure for people to move. At this minute I think it's the perfect stage for Ashley, the perfect stage for Gabby, they are thriving in the environment.'</p> <p>O'Neill will be happy so long as the only thing not thriving is his golf handicap.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338267835\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1834392476_yak-milk-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>A pioneering Chinese company is to market pasteurised Tibetan yak milk in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, in the hope that it will become a new superfood in the world's most populous country.</p> <p>At 24 yuan (\u00a32) for a small 250ml carton, Feifan - meaning 'uncommonly good' - costs several times as much as cow's milk. 'It's very natural, green, pure and high-quality. That's our big selling point - we aim at the high-end market,' said Ding Pengcheng of the Treasure of the Plateau Yak Milk Company. Over the next three years, the firm is to spend millions to crack the domestic and international markets, with the help of state investment. Yaks produce fewer than 300 litres of milk a year, while cows yield 35 times as much. The firm pays Tibetan farmers 16 yuan or more per litre; eight times the price of standard milk.</p> <p>The China Nutrition Society, a Ministry of Health-backed research institute, claims the amino acids, calcium, and vitamin A in yak milk are considerably higher than in cow's milk. Its appeal depends as much on the mystique of its origins as its nutritional qualities. Feifan is undergoing extra safety checks because of China's recent milk contamination scandal. Yet in the long run such concerns could boost the desire for products that combine modern hygiene with unsullied, back-to-the-land imagery.</p> <p>Tsering Droma is a typical Tibetan herder who can now look forward to tapping the Chinese market. Born into a herding family, she tends 30 yaks on steep slopes near the Karola pass. </p> <p>The animals are central to Tibetan culture: their butter is melted into tea and fuels the lamps that light monasteries. Dung keeps fires burning; bones are carved into beads. Yaks provide Droma and her family with everything they need. 'Female yaks are very important to us: we can get milk, make butter and cheese and get extra money by selling it. For the males, they can be used for transport,' she said. 'We can sell the yak skins and the meat and hair. All the parts can be sold. Then we buy things like grain.'</p> <p>But 100 miles away in Lhasa, the Treasure of the Plateau company is transforming this hand-to-mouth livelihood into a serious business. It is marketing the traditional staple as a superfood for aspirational middle-class households across China and beyond. Steam seeps from the pipes of its Tetrapak production line as it heats gallon after gallon of milk to 130C. In 2003, the firm sold just over 2m yuans worth of goods; this year it is on course to bring in up to 90m yuan. Each day the local market consumes between three and six tonnes of its yoghurt.</p> <p>The company's first batches of milk arrived in bowls, carried on herders' backs, and often with the unwelcome additions of insects and yak hair. Now they come in clean containers, usually delivered by motorbike or car - proof, says the company, that it is raising local incomes. That does not make it immune from controversy surrounding economic development. Its expansion into markets around China would be all but impossible without the Tibet-Qinghai rail line, which critics say has damaged the environment and speeded the erosion of Tibetan culture. Seventy per cent of the firm's 110 staff are Tibetan, but only a few are in senior posts. 'Our company carries out a lot of training for our Tibetan staff, but most of them don't have higher, college-level education,' Ding said.</p> <p>At the least, the company, and the government money behind it, are supporting long-impoverished herders. The authorities have been heavily criticised for forcibly settling nomads. But this state investment is helping some to increase their incomes without having to abandon their heritage. <br>It is what officials call 'development with Tibetan characteristics'. And yaks are as Tibetan as they come.</p>",
  "<p>On the morning I'm due to meet Camilla Wright, founding mother of the scurrilous website and online mailout, Popbitch, I while away a bit of time on a long piece in the New Yorker about the true meaning of Babar the Elephant. Its author, Adam Gopnik, posits various Babar theories: Babar is about a certain idea of France; it's an allegory of colonialism; it's a fable of the difficulties of bourgeois life. I read the piece, and I enjoy it. Still, when I'm done, what I mostly think is: yeah, right, Adam, but let's face it - what Babar's really about is an elephant who goes to the city and rides joyously up and down in a department-store elevator.</p> <p>Why am I telling you this? Well, the Babar piece and my experience of reading it was something of a rehearsal for my encounter with the world of Popbitch. While I'm in Wright's company, I take her analysis of gossip, the way she compares the secrets of the celebrity world to the 'consensus of information' that came out in the weeks before the invasion of Iraq - by which she seems to be suggesting that it's as important, say, to question a movie star's denial of his homosexuality as it is to query a government's claim about weapons of mass destruction - perfectly seriously. I nod my head, and I smile. But I'm not even halfway home before I'm thinking: but it's still gossip, isn't it? It's still who's sleeping with whom, who's taking what drug and where, who's going to be dropped by their record company, who behaves most badly in the first-class cabins of aeroplanes. </p> <p>Am I wrong to feel this? Possibly. Among other interesting facts that you really do need to know about Popbitch is that one of its 'friends' is Adam Curtis, the award-winning film-maker, a major theme of whose work is the way various elites try to impose their ideology on the rest of us (you will remember The Power of Nightmares, which drew parallels between the rise of radical Islam and of the American neocons). 'He's not really an editor,' says Wright, with a playful smile, when I ask her about his role. 'He's a friend.' How did they become friends? 'He liked reading Popbitch, and I liked watching his shows. Everyone [who is connected with the site] has that thing of wanting to go against the consensus, against the status quo. The world of pop culture is so important now, it's like a new establishment. So working out what's going on in that world is similarly interesting for him - and yes, there's also his obsession with marmots [Popbitch has a long-running fixation with pictures of cute animals, especially otters]. There are people who've read or contributed to Popbitch for years; they're a sounding board. Adam Macqueen of Private Eye is another.' In the past, Wright has talked about wanting to 'democratise gossip', saying that she dislikes the idea of the chattering classes in London knowing about something when the man in an office in Walsall does not. Is this still how she feels? Because it seems to me that, on this score, her work might now be done. 'Oh, there are definitely still secrets,' she says. 'Just because some celebrities are willing to put up their lives for public consumption doesn't mean that the stories that go around the chattering classes always come out.'</p> <p>Popbitch, which is now eight years old, is sent to 370,000 registered subscribers (of which I am one) every Thursday. It consists of gossip, jokes, pop facts, bizarre web links and pictures of furry animals, and is sometimes described, even by Wright herself, as the bastard child of Smash Hits and Private Eye. In other words, it manages to be both sweet and wicked at the same time; it loves a good pop song, and finds some celebs rather wondrous, but it takes pride in knocking others down, especially those who are seen to have ideas above their station (a particular bugbear are the demands celebrities make backstage, or on those working for or serving them). The strange and rather charming thing about Popbitch is that it has, over the years, managed to maintain an underground, homespun feel as its influence has grown and grown. Even if you've never heard of it, you will have bumped into it inadvertently. For one thing, it pioneered the 'blind story', the trick of writing about a celebrity without mentioning their name, leaving the reader to guess at their identity - a libel-swerve that is now aped by every tabloid. For another, it was the first to break such stories as David Beckham's infidelity (18 months before the News of the World), and the sexual antics of the former candidate for the leadership of Liberal Democrats. Most significantly of all, when it comes to the culture, the phrases it favours seep into our everyday language like sewage into the sea: Croydon facelift (hair scraped into a too-tight pony tail); pramface (teen mother in a track suit); tanorexic (addiction to being orange). Was it Popbitch or The Darkness who got us all calling cocaine 'gak'? Something tells me it was probably the former. </p> <p>For a long time, the people behind Popbitch refused to talk about it publicly. Then, slowly, they - or she - came out into the open (spurred on, perhaps, by the conviction of Julie Burchill that it was actually written by the Pet Shop Boys). Similarly, for a long time, those involved resisted the expansion of the brand. 'We were approached to do television, books and albums every year, pretty much from when we started,' says Wright. But she always said no. Even now, she claims not to know how much Popbitch would be worth were a decision taken to sell it. 'I've no idea. We've had lots of offers, but we've never got to the point of working that out.' </p> <p>But while Popbitch may not have many assets - her computer address book is about the beginning and the end of those - it is now a highly significant brand. Does this mean that she simply isn't motivated by money? 'I'm less motivated by money than I am by doing something that's fun, or that's having an effect. But if you go into any kind of journalism, you're not motivated by money, unless you're stupid.' She laughs. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the Popbitch website now links to Popbet, a reality-TV gambling site, and to the Popbitch online radio station (now playing, er ... 'My Name is Tallulah', from the Bugsy Malone soundtrack). This month, a Popbitch book is published, in time for Christmas. It's like an old-fashioned annual, and includes the first-ever issue of Popbitch ('Only a couple of months until Meg Mathews gives birth, and the world wants to know what the name will be ...'), a dress-your-own cut-out Pete Burns doll, and a list of the worst-ever celebrity baby names (the son of the actress Shannyn Sossamon is called Audio Science - honestly). It's very rude, and it's very funny. For reasons I cannot quite explain, I've only to look at its reconstruction - starring a cuddly toy, and two plastic dolls - of the moment when Montcore, the white tiger belonging to the Las Vegas stars Siegfried and Roy, turned on Roy and tried to eat him, to break into childish laughter. </p> <p>The Popbitch office is next door to a Soho betting shop, and is a good deal smaller than Posh Spice's (aka 'Skeletor' in Popbitch-speak) smallest wardrobe, or so I'm guessing. 'This is basically ... it,' says Wright, waving one arm at the gloomy cubicle that houses her desk and that of her sole employee, a work-experience intern (the technical people, who are not employed by Popbitch full-time, all work outside London). So how does the mailout happen? 'I have 300 to 400 repeat sources, of which 50 are really good,' she says, of those who give her stories (for which they are not paid). 'Over the years, I've got to know lots of them. It is weird: it's new media, yet you rely on the same tricks as old media. Some you meet face to face; they're more comfortable with that. Some love being anonymous. Some I've had email relationships with for eight years: they could be someone's cleaner, or they could be Madonna.' </p> <p>But how does she know if what they tell her is true? 'You've got to have intuition and, over time, that builds up. There are patterns. With some sources, you know the kind of things they [are likely to] know. Too much detail is a sign someone is making it up. Sometimes you know it's true because it's the kind of thing that wouldn't be worth making up. Some things you want to be true, then you find out that it is not very likely they are. I do try to do as much checking as possible with secondary sources.' Does she still feel a prick of excitement when someone emails her a story? 'Yes, if it's a good one. Or when you get some interaction: if it hits a nerve, or you've got something right.' Last month, she ran what she regards as a fairly perfect Popbitch story about the fact that the satirist Chris Morris cannot find a TV channel willing to make his new comedy about a bunch of inept Yorkshire jihadis (it's perfect because it's gossip, but gossip that touches on issues of political correctness and censorship). In the following days, eight contacts emailed to confirm the story, or to relate similar experiences of their own.</p> <p>Wright has a deliciously ironic face. It's hard to know what she's really thinking. So, I honestly can't tell: does she really take celebrity gossip (most of the stuff she runs is a bit more low rent than the Chris Morris story) seriously, or is it just a laugh? 'It's both,' she says, straight off. 'I'm not ironic about pop, or pop culture. I think a lot of the people in it are fabulous. I look back to being 11 or 12, and getting into bands for the first time... The first Japan album! I still look at it at home, and it still makes me excited. Pop culture enriches life. It's tosh, but it's brilliant, lovable tosh. It deserves to be treated with some love. But at the same time, there are actors who pronounce on world affairs. That needs to be policed.' She hesitates. 'It's loving the bullshit, but at the same time wanting to point out the stupidity.' So I guess a lawyer always reads Popbitch first? 'No!' Her eyes widen. 'Because what would they leave in?' Wright has had her share of scary legal letters over the years, but the good news is that most celebrities are apparently so insecure and vain (or so sassy and well advised: take your pick) that they want to be seen to be in on the joke. Well, hooray. As for whether they get the other jokes, the proper, old-fashioned gags that are attached to the end of Popbitch every week, somehow, I doubt it. The last one I read relied for its punchline on the reader knowing the difference between a Freudian, a Jungian and a Lacanian - not a line that would have Jordan rolling around on her bedroom floor, I fear.</p> <p>Popbitch started in 2000, when Wright was freelancing for magazines like The Face, and her then boyfriend, Neil Stevenson, who is still the co-owner of Popbitch though no longer involved on a day-to-day basis, was working at Heat (which then was just another entertainment magazine with vaguely highbrow pretensions). Both of them despised the way PRs controlled stars, but they also shared a conviction that grown-ups could enjoy both Private Eye and Smash Hits. So they began writing Popbitch. The first issue was sent to 15 friends; by issue 10, this had swollen to 80; by issue 20, they had 1,000 subscribers. What Wright felt then, she still feels today: 'I want people who get it to like it, rather than just to chuck it away.' She would rather have 370,000 truly devoted fans than 500,000 half-hearted ones - and all the evidence suggests that this is, indeed, what she has got. The Popbitch message board, on which readers can post stories and chat to one another, is a unique and somewhat introverted community. 'It's bizarre. There have been weddings, and babies, among people who post on it. Unlike most online communities, it has a basis in real life. It's the sort of place where, if you lose your house, someone on the message board will offer you a place to stay. A lot of people lose their jobs because they spend so long on it. But it is quite vicious. It's like a playground. You have to be strong enough, to be able to hand out insults, to stay there.' Some posters have become minor celebrities in their own right. When one, Reverend Goatboy, died in 2007, his passing was noted in The Times.</p> <p>Wright, who is 37, grew up in Plymouth; her father is retired, and her mother is a cleaner at a hospital. She went to a grammar school, and then to Oxford, to Oriel, then one of the university's most male, and most traditional, colleges. 'It was like going into a different universe. It was the time of house music and clubs. I'd spent the months before working in Tenerife in a night club. Then I came back and I went to Oxford. So that was quite a strange experience. On the first day, I was in an expensive, white, Italian track suit with a baseball cap. Everyone else was in rugby shirts, and the girls were all in nice clothes. I felt like an alien. The first term was hard. But underneath, everyone is quite similar at the age of 18. I'm sure I changed, and they changed, too. I still have really good friends from there.' Is this where her outsider tendency - her sceptical, satirical eye; the Popbitch alertness to the myriad calibrations of style and social class - comes from originally? Another butter-wouldn't-melt smile. 'Perhaps.' She is certainly quite tough, I think. She has been gossiped about herself, and she is 'OK' with it. 'You have to be. You can't dish it out and not take it.' Is she thick-skinned? 'Probably. I want Popbitch to go for hard targets not just soft ones, so you have to be: people are going to be shouting at you.'</p> <p>Because Wright was in at the beginning of the crazed birth of 21st-century gossip - where Popbitch led, Heat, Holy Moly, Gawker and a zillion others followed, albeit in less sophisticated fashion - people expect her to be able tell us where it is going, too. And she can, to a degree. But don't get your hopes up. When I ask her if we might already have passed its high watermark (the sales of certain gossip magazines have taken a slight dip lately), she shakes her head. 'I think that's about content. If all you get is pictures of celebrities looking bad, you think: \"Oh God, someone else with a sweat patch.\"' She has never done stories about 'women and appearance and weight problems' because she thinks 'there's enough misogyny and self-hatred elsewhere'. She's also wary of pregnancy and child-related stories. 'We're pushing at the boundaries of the privacy of the womb, now, desperate to get a woman to say she's pregnant. We did put something in about J-Lo expecting twins, but I did it because it came from a friend of hers who said it was an open secret. Serious illness ... cancer ... pictures of Patrick Swayze and Paul Newman [both have cancer] and stories saying how terrible they look. I know it's news, but I'm uncomfortable with it.' She pauses. 'But maybe it's not voyeuristic. We all face death. I did some talks at summer schools at the LSE and Westminster University. One of the things you can do now is come from around the world and do a course in London in celebrity media. It was interesting. Most students didn't see anything wrong in the coverage of illness.' </p> <p>So where are we going? 'I don't know. But if we're looking into the future, I can see the paps pushing cameras into the faces of small children, and [the mourners] at funeral processions. It's got a long way to go yet. Gossip has been part of human existence since we learned to communicate. It used to be localised, but now our lives are so fragmented, we don't really know our neighbours, and thanks to the technology and global stars, it's so easy to gossip about them instead. So long as people are willing to put their lives out there for us to laugh at for money or fame, I can't see any of it going away.' The trouble is, though, that for someone like her, who claims to want to go against the consensus, this constant policing is counter-productive - as even she concedes. 'If you look at the American election campaign, everything is focused on who's saying what, and what the nuances are.' Policy? It's as rare as a picture of Victoria Beckham smiling.</p> <p>Some people have taken Mark Frith's recent book about his decade as editor of Heat as a mea culpa - and it's true that, occasionally, a batsqueak of contrition can be heard emanating from its pages. But it's mostly just an attempt on his part to reposition himself for the next stage of his media career, just as Piers Morgan, the former editor of the Daily Mirror, did when he published The Insider. But Wright isn't like either of these men; she may not be guilt-ridden (she definitely isn't, if you ask me), but nor is she a media tart. She doesn't want to hang with celebrities; nor does she want to be a judge on some seventh-rate TV talent show. Still, the truth is that I can't quite put my finger on what motivates her. Which brings me back to Babar. Maybe it's very simple, after all. Popbitch is gossip, and Wright likes gossip. So, she will go on sending it to us until she doesn't like it any more. And then she'll do something else. And, since she is so bright and funny, that will be a big success, too. </p> <p>In the meantime, safely at home, I'm waiting for Popbitch, a taster of which she gave me only hours before. And here it comes ... a TV presenter can't sing, even though he's landed a job that requires it; a royal hanger-on has an increasingly indiscreet drug habit; a football player is losing his hair faster than 'a Chernobyl engineer'; John McCain mentions that the bracelet he wears belonged to an 'Iraq veteran who was killed' at every opportunity. My eye skims down the screen, as it is has done every Thursday for several years. You can look for the subtext, for sure. But it's probably more fun to enjoy the bad behaviour, and give grateful thanks that, while the rich and famous might have more shoes, cars and homes than you, the filter between their brains and their mouths is in need of some serious repair.</p> <p>\u2022 Popbitch 2009 is out 16 October</p>",
  "<p>There is glee on Kia Joorabchian's face as he hurtles across his box on the halfway line at the Emirates Stadium to celebrate Robin van Persie's opening goal. 'Now, that is football,' Joorabchian informs one of his international guests as Arsenal ease ahead of Porto and set off on a Champions League cruise.</p> <p>Joorabchian has supported Arsenal since his childhood years as an escapee from Iran's Islamic Revolution. As his business career meandered through market-floor oil trading, US-based hedge funds, UK car sales, London health centres and a Middle Eastern 'distress fund', he once explored the idea of buying into the club before deciding he could afford a \u00a3100,000-a-year corporate box, but not the whole shebang.</p> <p>Instead, Joorabchian found another way into football. He became the lightning-rod front man of an otherwise secretive buy-in to Brazilian club Corinthians, which brought unprecedented transfer spending and a league title but ended in a federal police investigation, court actions, frozen bank accounts and relegation. Joorabchian has denied any wrongdoing throughout and an arrest warrant issued against him in Brazil has been suspended. He led an ultimately rejected takeover bid for West Ham. And he established himself as one of football's more important fixers - albeit taking a central role in one of the English game's great controversies en route.</p> <p>When Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez left Corinthians for West Ham after performing well for Argentina at the 2006 World Cup finals, it was to general astonishment. Here were two of South America's most accomplished young footballers signing for a relatively minor club who had just finished ninth in their first season back in the Premier League.</p> <p>If the deal appeared too good to be true, it was. Soon it emerged that West Ham had not purchased the Argentines, but borrowed them with no control over their next move. The sellers were not Corinthians, but four investment funds - Media Sports Investments (MSI), Just Sports Incorporated, Global Soccer Agencies (GSA) and Mystere Services Limited - represented by Joorabchian.</p> <p>Worse still, West Ham broke the Premier League's rules by hiding the third-party ownership of the players' 'economic rights'. When the barely used Mascherano left for Liverpool the following January, the League was informed of the transgression, sparking a process of tribunal and litigation that is still unresolved. West Ham were told to tear up their contract with Tevez and his owners, yet, according to the independent tribunal, secretly promised to honour it. The tribunal fined them \u00a35.5m for rule breaches in April 2007, but did not deduct points from the relegation-threatened club. Sheffield United went down and, like Joorabchian, took High Court action against West Ham for breach of contract. As the legal arguments unfolded, West Ham agreed to an independent arbitration process, which last month decreed that a points penalty should have been imposed and the Blades were entitled to an as yet undecided sum of compensation. Throw in their legal fees, and a pair of South Americans who arrived for next to nothing may ultimately cost West Ham as much as \u00a350m.</p> <p>There are those associated with West Ham who say they will never forgive Joorabchian for the problems he has caused their club, despite the fact that the tribunal's findings were against the club and not against Joorabchian, who believes he did nothing wrong.</p> <p>'The question is, why are we responsible for those deals?' he asks. 'Why are we responsible for what happened to West Ham? And no one can answer that, because what we did was perfectly within the regulations of the Premier League. We brought in two loan players, we made a contract with West Ham United to loan them out. If West Ham do not register that contract with the Premier League it is out of our hands. I am not responsible to register the contract with West Ham with the Premier League, I am not responsible to register the contract of Carlos at Man United with the Premier League. That's to do with the club and the people inside it. We're making a deal. I made sure that on my side the contract - the release of the player, the registration - everything is legal. They have to make sure on the football side everything is legal.</p> <p>'Believe me, if we had done anything wrong we also would have been under the lawsuit, under scrutiny. But clearly since we have never been sued, never been accused of any wrongdoing, everyone has granted that we hadn't done anything wrong. And, quite contrary, everyone knows that third-party ownership was permitted because Liverpool and Man United both managed to do it after [the West Ham deal].'</p> <p>On that he is half right. Though the Premier League permitted Mascherano and Tevez to move north on loan deals that left their economic rights in the hands of the funds Joorabchian manages, the League ensured their contracts specified fixed periods in which the players could not be sold and at the end of which Liverpool and United had first option to buy at a predetermined price.</p> <p>While League officials say that West Ham would have been allowed to structure their Mascherano and Tevez loans in such fashion had they declared Joorabchian's involvement from the off, they have since introduced rules that outlaw transfers of that type. When, for example, Manchester City sought to sign J\u00f4 this summer they were required to buy the Brazilian striker 100 per cent. No loan deal, even of the Man United-Tevez formulation, was allowed.</p> <p>The principle, say the Premier League, is 'to stop third-party ownership at these shores'. Their worry was having no regulatory control over the individuals or companies that owned such players; that they could do little to stop a third-party owner from instructing one of his goalkeepers to allow a forward from the same stable to score against him to increase the latter's market value.</p> <p>Joorabchian's response to the new rule is interesting. He accepts that third-party ownership could be problematic in countries such as England where some clubs are owned by billionaires. 'I'm not saying there is a potential for bad behaviour, but there is a potential that someone can say it's unfair,' he says. 'They [the Premier League] said this system doesn't work in England - fair enough - so we stopped doing that.' But only in England. Joorabchian still manages a company, Sports Invest, that purchases the economic rights of talented footballers, loans them to clubs and waits for the player's market value to rise before selling on the rights for a profit.</p> <p>'It is the South American model and a model that appears all over Europe,' he explains. 'We'll invest in a player and loan him to the club. Then if the club thinks that that player is amazing they can buy him from us. If the club wants to buy the player prior to us buying him, that's OK, too, but a lot of clubs don't want to take the risk. So we invest the money and let the club borrow the player. Of course the club pay only a loan fee but we get the upside if the player is successful. And if the player is unsuccessful we get the downside. We still have a business in South America and across Europe, and the business is very profitable.'</p> <p>It is indeed commonplace in Europe and within the rules - at least two of the Porto side at Arsenal arrived in Portugal on transfers part-funded by GSA. </p> <p>When the FA recently circulated a register of unlicensed agents, instructing clubs not to use the blacklisted individuals in transfer deals, questions were asked as to why Joorabchian's name did not appear on it. The FA explain that is because Joorabchian does not engage in agent activity - essentially that he does not formally sign off on transfer deals.</p> <p>'I'm not a football agent and I don't practise as an agent. I think the agency business is very different,' Joorabchian says. 'We also have a business that advises players on their rights. We advise them on their image, on their financial stability, we advise them on every aspect, because a lot of agents are not professional to do that. A lot of agents work for us and basically they just do the player transfer. We provide the structure, and for that they work for us.'</p> <p>His company also advises clubs on transfers and player contracts, puts them in contact with agents and even offers to scout for them. Joorabchian will not reveal the number of Premier League teams he works with, nor the agents he operates with, for fear of 'losing my competitive edge', but admits to dealing on an informal basis with Manchester City and to having one formal consultancy agreement - with West Ham United.</p> <p>'We provide them with a manner of how to get a player,' Joorabchian says. 'If they don't know which agent to contact to get X player, we will resource that for them, connect the agent to them. If they want information on players in South America we can provide it. We have a full scouting service, we provide them with a structure. We are another arm of the football director. We've been involved in advising them on what offers to accept and what not. And we've been paid according to how we've agreed with them, but I can't disclose how we've been paid. It's all within the context of our consultancy agreement.'</p> <p>If the concept of West Ham's new owners employing a man so central to their current travails as an adviser appears bizarre, it may be because it was agreed as an out-of-court settlement to Joorabchian's High Court action against the club for tearing up the contract agreed over Tevez and then charging him to move the player to Manchester United. 'We'd given them a free loan and they wanted to charge us \u00a32m, which was unfair,' Joorabchian says. 'So we processed and settled to get our money back. Not to gain any money, but to get our money back.'</p> <p>Whose money, exactly, Joorabchian will not say. The exiled Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky is one businessman whose name has been linked to MSI, though he denies any involvement. Players' agent Pini Zahavi has admitted to advising GSA but denied being an investor. The structure of Joorabchian's company is designed to keep investors' identities concealed. So restrictive are his confidentiality agreements, Joorabchian cannot even say if he is an investor himself. </p> <p>'I can't reveal any shareholder,' he says. 'It's under my obligation. What I can tell you is that I manage the investment group, I don't work with MSI, I have no connection with MSI, I resigned from that in 2006, so that's that. But I manage the investment group and obviously when the investment group is profitable, as fund manager, you also get a cut.'</p> <p>From his plush seats at Arsenal that cut appears to be a good one. The Premier League do not like him, but Kia Joorabchian has no intention of exiting football any time soon.</p>",
  "<p>Before I arrive in Dubai, I meet 'Clare' on an expat website who insists I visit her at her home in the Meadows, a housing development in the city's suburbs - 'to give you an idea of how so many people get misled into thinking they are in Milton Keynes'. Half an hour in a taxi later, past the skyscrapers, and the construction sites, and the six-lane highways, and minibuses of Indian and Pakistani workers being shuttled from one project to another, I'm in a straight-out-of-a-David-Lynch-film picture-perfect suburban road lined with picture-perfect suburban villas.</p> <p>And there's Clare. 'That's what I wanted you to see!' she says before I'm even out of the car. 'Look at that.' I'm looking at a wheelie bin and not really understanding her point. 'People see the wheelie bin and they think it's all familiar, and normal, and therefore nothing bad can happen. Ha!' </p> <p>The Meadows is a gated enclave with a uniformed security guard and lush green landscaping, and Clare is a British expatriate wife whose husband is a contractor. To all intents, they're living what looks very much like the good life: there's a pool in the back garden, year-round sun, and in the living room Sky News is on. </p> <p>'Oh yes, it looks good, doesn't it? But we've all made a pact with the devil to be here. You get the tax-free salary, but in return you have to give up all your rights. There's no accountability, no transparency, no rule of law. There's no legislative body. Very few employment rights. It looks like a modern country, but it takes more than a few skyscrapers to create one of those. Scratch the surface and it's a different story. And if you're a silly young girlie who gets into trouble, then forget it.'</p> <p>There's a particular silly young girlie Clare is referring to: Michelle Palmer, a 36-year-old advertising executive who in July this year was arrested for allegedly having sex on a beach with Vince Acors, a 34-year-old visiting company director from Kent. </p> <p>It's been a tabloid sensation. Palmer's 'Bridget Jones' lifestyle endlessly examined; at least a dozen conflicting versions of the story printed - they did have sex, they didn't have sex, Palmer may or may not have waved her shoe and called the policeman 'a fucking Muslim' - the case comes to court this week and the prosecution is said to have concrete DNA evidence to prove they didn't have sex, but beyond that, almost nothing is certain other than the fact that, if convicted, they both face up to six years in jail.</p> <p>And whatever the verdict, Palmer has already lost her job - with the publishers ITP which produces Time Out Dubai and whose chairman is Andrew Neil; but then there's no such thing as unfair dismissal in the United Arab Emirates - and been mauled in the press. The Daily Mail is in strict accordance with sharia law on this point: it's the woman's shame. </p> <p>In Dubai, it's shocked the local population and split the expat community between those who feel sympathy and those who think she deserves nothing less than a stoning. </p> <p>'What I can't believe,' says Clare, 'is the amount of venom directed towards her. The reaction here has been unbelievable. I think people are under such pressure. They know it's not the dream. And they need a scapegoat. The fact is that if you can ascribe blame to someone else's misfortune, then you are indemnifying yourself against it happening to you.'</p> <p>There are a lot of Brits in Dubai. A lot of people that it, or something similar, could have happened to. People who don't much want to contemplate how the judicial system works (at best haphazardly, at worst unequally), or how long you can be detained without trial (months at a time) or what the British embassy will do to help you (not a lot). In the past year, 230 Britons have found themselves imprisoned for offences ranging from driving under the influence to bouncing a cheque.</p> <p>It's a minimum four-year term if any trace of drugs is found on you: the Radio One DJ Grooverider, caught with 2.16g of cannabis, spent 10 months inside before being pardoned two weeks ago, and Cat Le-Huy, a producer with Endemol, spent three weeks in jail without being charged, for possession of Melatonin - jetlag pills.</p> <p>The Palmer-Acors case is about much more than any of this, though. It's exposed the very contradiction that has made modern Dubai what it is: a tolerant haven in an intolerant region. And it's the tension between the two Dubais: the socially conservative society whose penal code is based on sharia; and the other Dubai, the increasingly visible Dubai, whose numbers are growing with every fresh planeload of people who land at the airport and wear crop tops to the mall and drink shooters in the bars. </p> <p>It's to Dubai's enormous credit that these two halves have so far been accommodated side by side, but the strain has started to tell. When I visited last week, it was Ramadan and the restrictions in Dubai are far harsher than in any other Arab country I've visited. Eating and drinking during daylight hours is illegal; even for non-Muslims, having a sip of water can mean a jail sentence. I got the timing of my trip all wrong. I'd wanted to check out the Friday 'brunch' scene, all-day boozeathons which provided the setting for the Palmer-Acors romance, and I email the editor of an English language newspaper in a panic. </p> <p>'Don't worry,' he emails back. 'You'll see plenty.' And it's true: I can't drink coffee at the Starbucks next to my hotel, food is only served in a curtained-off enclave, and the clubs are closed - a DJ called Michael Robert describes the usual scene as 'like Ibiza but minus the drugs, the fights and the aggro'. But after 7.30pm, all across the city, in any number of bars, it's like downtown Croydon at closing time on a Friday night. </p> <p>At Long's Bar, it's a crush of short skirts and spaghetti straps - alcohol is illegal if you're a local, and practically a social obligation if you're not. And afterwards, a local journalist takes me on a tour of 'the dark side', taking in a hooker bar in a four-star chain hotel. Prostitution is illegal, but absolutely blatant - every shape, size, nationality, ethnicity and possible aesthetic taste catered for. </p> <p>But then, somehow Dubai manages to be all things to all people. It's capitalism's ultimate expression: the land of opportunity, the most developed city in the Middle East, a free port. It's ruled absolutely by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and is a constituent part of the UAE, a federation of seven emirates, including, down the road, immensely oil-rich Abu Dhabi, whose ruling family has just bought Manchester City. Dubai, on the other hand, never had much oil; it's been forced to develop in other ways, to provide whatever is needed, and it's done so more quickly and successfully than anyone could anticipate. It knows what the rest of the world wants and has built it before anyone else has even realised.</p> <p>Alexander McNabb, a PR executive and the writer of a blog called Fake Plastic Souks, arrived 15 years ago, when 'it was still a village, a strange and very foreign place'. It was the entrep\u00f4t of the Gulf and its R'n'R facility, where oilmen came to relax - they knew the rules and relished the freedom. It's this that's changed. There are now 100,000 Brits living and working in Dubai. And last year 1.1m UK tourists visited - despite summer temperatures of 50C plus, it's now the second most popular long-haul destination after Florida. And the ways in which the city is changing are in many ways a reflection of Britain itself.</p> <p>Now, says McNabb, 'you drive your western car to your western office. At the weekends you go to the western hotels and have your western buffets and western-style beach club, and it's quite easy to ignore the fact that you're abroad.'</p> <p>He's right. It is easy. It's four days before I hear any actual Arabic. Most remarkably of all the remarkable things about Dubai is that it's occupied almost entirely by foreigners: native Emiratis make up barely 20 per cent of the population. They're a minority in their own country. </p> <p>When I meet Sultan Al-Qassemi, a businessman and journalist, he points out that the Emiratis are handling this rather better than the British would. 'Can you imagine? It's the equivalent of there being 55m foreigners in Britain, and just 5m of you. It's a unique case, and I think we deserve extra credit for the way we are handling it. The country is completely open. It is a utopia! Anyone can come here! We are one of the most tolerant countries in the world. And all this has happened in a single generation. Thirty years ago, it was desert.'</p> <p>He sends me down the road, to the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding and I arrive in time for iftar - the breaking of the fast. There's a group of expats and we're given dates and water, and then platters of home-cooked food are brought while young Emiratis tell us about their culture. It's fascinating: they're so friendly, and articulate and welcoming. 'It's so difficult to meet Emiratis, to talk to them. In a year, I haven't properly met one,' a British woman named Paula tells me. </p> <p>Khulooda, a bright and sparky 21-year-old in a fringed abaya, tells me she's studying marketing and tourism. She thinks people maybe need to do a little more research about the country before they arrive. That maybe people should wear more appropriate clothing when they go to the mall. That Palmer and Acors should have known better. I think maybe she's right. And I hope, for her sake, that she goes into some other industry instead. </p> <p>A decade ago, who had even heard of going on holiday in Dubai? But what Dubai has proved is that if you build it, they will come. For if there's one thing Dubai can do, it's build: one third of the world's cranes are here at any one time, most of them directly outside of my hotel window. I try and count them but give up at 70. The highest is perched a kilometre up in the air, on the top of the Burj Dubai, already the tallest building in the world, and it's not yet finished. Next month, the biggest shopping mall in the world will open, the Dubai Mall, and shortly you'll be able to fly into the world's biggest airport - six runways and the size of Hong Kong island. What's more, if you stay in your hotel, you need never even know you're in an autocratic Islamic state where it's illegal to hold your wife's hand in public, or be gay, or found with 0.003g of cannabis - less than a grain of sugar - on the sole of your shoe, as Keith Brown was, a youth worker from the West Midlands who was sentenced to four years in jail. </p> <p>But the hotels are wonderful. And even the Observer's modest budget runs to a five-star number. I'm on the 35th floor, with vertiginous views down, vertiginous views up. It's slightly queasy-making, more so after I talk to Chris Davidson, a Gulf political expert based at Durham University. </p> <p>Two of the 9/11 hijackers were from the UAE, he tells me. And every weekday, the malls are full of able-bodied young men simply hanging out. 'They're the first generation who've had this cradle-to-grave security, who receive a house from the government and money to get married, who've not known hardship or what it is not to have air conditioning. How are they reacting to what they see happening to their country? And if something did happen here, tourism would collapse overnight. Real estate would collapse. Dubai is so fragile. It's the result of a global boom and it's never properly been put to the test.'</p> <p>Economically, nobody's sure how it will weather the global crisis. The region is awash with ever-increasing petrodollars, but Dubai's construction projects are highly leveraged. And culturally, tourism is Dubai's great unmentionable can of worms, its fault line. A blogger, who'll only identify herself as Secret Dubai, tells me Dubai's marketing machine has deliberately created 'the false sense of westernness, of a trashy holiday resort'. And, according to Davidson, it's reached 'a critical mass. Previously people were corralled into five-star enclaves; what the Palmer-Acors case shows is that they're starting to leak out.'</p> <p>The week I visit, Atlantis opens - a mega resort owned by Sol Kerzner, the South African who gave the world Sun City. It's a vast pink edifice that looks like something Katie Price might design, built on an artificial island shaped like a palm tree. </p> <p>It's actually only one of three palms under construction, which together will add 520km of beaches to Dubai's coastline, and where the Beckhams are alleged to have 'bought' a villa, along with Rio Ferdinand and Michael Owen. It's all PR, but then nowhere in the world wants the Beckhams to love it as much as Dubai. It's more of a WAG than almost any other place on earth: flashy, artificially enhanced, desperate to please, all things to all people.</p> <p>I tour the resort and dutifully write down the stats: $1.5bn to build,1,539 rooms, a Nobu and a Locatelli restaurant, a $25,000-a-night suite, 65,000 marine animals, a 1.4km beach.</p> <p>Do you think most tourists even know it's Ramadan, I ask.</p> <p>'That's a good question,' says the PR, a South African. 'I think they receive information at the airport.'</p> <p>Actually, they don't, I say. We ponder this for a moment, and then she tells me about what a wonderful life she's had since she moved there.</p> <p>Back in the Meadows, Clare invites me to an expat ladies' coffee morning. It's not an obvious place to go and meet a hotbed of radical malcontents. The lawns are neat, the communal pool still inviting. And yet... Nobody's managing to save. Rents are sky high: \u00a345,000 a year for a modest villa, paid in advance. And you can't move jobs: your visa is sponsored by your employer. </p> <p>Jane says: 'If I knew now what I knew then, I just wouldn't have come.' She's spent months and months trying to get her daughter with mild ADHD into any sort of school. Laura bought a house, in a 'lovely, quiet, very green development' and the road in front of it has just been torn up to build a six-lane highway. And Rebecca, who's lived in Dubai for 13 years, tells story after story of the Dubai-dream-gone-wrong. </p> <p>'People just don't know what they're getting themselves into,' she says. 'There's no social infrastructure, no safety net, nothing.' You don't even have to do anything wrong; a bad case of bad luck is enough. She puts me in touch with Richard, a twinkly fortysomething who came to Dubai as a salesman with a multinational company. 'And then, in one month, I had a car accident, lost my job, and my marriage fell apart.'</p> <p>Richard fell behind on his car payments, his bank loans, his credit cards. 'Everybody lives beyond their means here. It's all front. It's like Dubai - a totally false appearance to what it actually is.' He was charged by the police with defaulting on his loans and his passport was confiscated. 'So I couldn't get another job and I couldn't pay the debt, and I couldn't leave the country... and to cut a very long story short, I got 12 months.'</p> <p>It's quite a story. He's only been out two weeks, but he's still managing just about to smile. But not even the judges are Emiratis: they're on short-stay visas like everyone else, and the only thing he had going in his favour, he says, is that he wasn't Asian. 'Tons of them are in for practically nothing: jaywalking or owing \u00a310.'</p> <p>All over Dubai you see construction workers outside in the searing heat. They're the ones building Dubai - they live in what are openly called 'labour camps', have very often paid hundreds of dollars to an agency for a visa and are trapped for years until they've paid off the debt. The 7,500 workers on the Burj Dubai are paid $7.50 a day; unskilled ones $4. It's how globalisation works, of course. We get to buy our cheap Primark tops because in a factory far, far away somebody isn't paid very much to make them. But in Dubai, you see it every time you step outside.</p> <p>Nick McGeehan, founder of an organisation called Mafiwasta, tells me it's more than that. 'The difference is that the salaries paid in sweatshops in foreign countries reflect the economic weakness of that country. Furthermore, the people who work in them go home to their families at night.'</p> <p>He was an oil contractor but was so appalled at the plight of these workers that he set up Mafiwasta and is attempting to make a legal case that the UAE government is complicit in these workers' enslavement. He forwards an email to me he's recently received from an Indian recruitment agent. She's trying to help 133 men she sent to Dubai to fulfil a contract who haven't been paid, whose passports have been confiscated, who are not just living in inhumane, insanitary conditions but had been denied even basic necessities such as drinking water.</p> <p>'It's very unusual for an agent to come forward, and even more so to have one who actually cares about what happens to the workers,' says McGeehan. The only recourse, he tells her, is to get it in the newspapers... </p> <p>Both Secret Dubai and Chris Davidson have fallen foul of the UAE's censorship laws. The Secret Dubai blog, winner of a Webby award, is blocked - along with My Space, Flickr and Friends Reunited - and Davidson's recently published book Dubai: The Vulnerability of Success was, like Harry Potter, banned, although the ban has now been lifted.</p> <p>Mostly though, the authorities rely on editors to self-censor - an even more effective weapon. 'I defy a journalist who has been here a few months, who has got their child into a school, to rock the boat,' says Davidson. I interview a high-profile Emirati academic, and later he rings me up and says: 'You're not going to write anything... critical, are you? Our culture is different from yours, you see. But I didn't say anything negative, did I?'</p> <p>He points me, as several others do, toward Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a professor of political science at Emirates university, and possibly the most outspoken person in the country. 'He says really quite remarkable things,' the other academic tells me. 'And he gets away with it. It's very surprising.'</p> <p>Maybe he's fearless. Or maybe it is, as he says, that others need to be braver. 'We have to have more accountability of the government, more criticism of the policies. More talk about our future and where we are going. Dubai is an amazing place. We are so much further ahead than the rest of the Middle East, but we can't be first on social indicators and last on political ones... It's an embarrassment.'</p> <p>Even more than that, he says, the place needs to take a long, hard look at itself. Because in 2015, he estimates, Emiratis will make up 10 per cent of the population. And in 2025, at the same rate of growth, zero per cent. 'At the moment when we have everything, we're in danger of losing it all - our very identity.'</p> <p>I don't go out of my way to track Palmer and Acors down. The case is being heard this week so it's a particularly sensitive time for them. And anyway, they're not really the story. They were drunk and foolish and they might pay an exceedingly high price for their actions, but more than anything else they're simply fallout from an ideological schism that is not of their making.</p> <p>I don't look for them, but almost everyone I meet is acquainted with one or both of them. Palmer has been in hiding for the past two months, reportedly suffering from anxiety and panic attacks. And Acors? He's there in Long's Bar when I visit. In fact, he's not just in the same bar, he's standing drinking with the same group of friends.</p> <p>I'm all set to question him, but his friends take me aside: 'He's just an ordinary bloke. He won't talk to you. Just leave him alone.' So I do. It's true, he's just an ordinary bloke. In an extraordinary place. At precisely the wrong moment in time.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday October 13 2008.

  "<p>The snow has arrived early in Reykjavik after an unusually long and warm summer. The freeze has brought out the ghostly green haze of the aurora borealis - the Northern Lights - the shape of which shifts dramatically across the tiny city's black skies.</p> <p>The bars and restaurants of Iceland's capital are packed, the Range Rovers and BMWs are parked nose to tail all along the streets of the central 101 district, and music is pumping from a black stretch Hummer limousine cruising by.</p> <p>'What can we do? Its difficult times but we've spent all day talking about it, watching the news getting worse and worse. We had to go out and be with friends. Maybe it's like the party at the end of the world,' says Egill Tomasson, 32, sitting in the Kaffeebarinn bar.</p> <p>Iceland is on the brink of collapse. Inflation and interest rates are raging upwards. The krona, Iceland's currency, is in freefall and is rated just above those of Zimbabwe and Turkmenistan. One of the country's three independent banks has been nationalised, another is asking customers for money, and the discredited government and officials from the central bank have been huddled behind closed doors for three days with still no sign of a plan. International banks won't send any more money and supplies of foreign currency are running out. </p> <p>People talk about whether a new emergency unity government is needed and if the EU would fast-track the country to membership. On Friday the queues at the banks were huge, as people moved savings into the most secure accounts. Yesterday people were buying up supplies of olive oil and pasta after a supermarket spokesman announced on Friday night that they had no means of paying the foreign currency advances needed to import more foodstuffs.</p> <p>This North Atlantic volcanic island, which is the size of Cuba, with a population of 320,000 - the size of Coventry's - is an unlikely player on the global financial stage. It is famous for its fish, geysers and for winning the UN's 2007 'best country to live in' poll. But Iceland built its extraordinary wealth on the crest of the worldwide credit boom and now the crunch is sweeping it away, bankrupting a people for whom the past eight years have been, for most of them and by their own admission, one long party.</p> <p>The nation's celebrated rags-to-riches story began in the Nineties when free market reforms, fish quota cash and a stock market based on stable pension funds allowed Icelandic entrepreneurs to go out and sweep up international credit. Britain and Denmark were favourite shopping haunts, and in 2004 alone Icelanders spent \u00a3894m on shares in British companies. In just five years, the average Icelandic family saw its wealth increase by 45 per cent. </p> <p>But, as a result of the international banking crisis, the billionaires who own everything from West Ham United football club to the Somerfield supermarket chain, Hamleys toy shops and the House of Fraser, are in trouble and the country is drowning in debt.</p> <p>Iceland's cheap labour force, the Poles and Lithuanians, have left already - there's little point in sending home such a worthless currency, and the tourist season is over. Iceland is on its own.</p> <p>In the Kaffeebarinn, Egill Tomasson isn't drinking because he has a music festival to organise. Iceland Airwaves takes place in a fortnight, when more than 100 Icelandic bands and 50 foreign ones will play in venues around the city over four days. Most of the tickets have been sold in krona, but the international acts need to be paid in euros, which is going to cost the organisers dearly. </p> <p>'People here are going to need this festival,' says Tomasson. 'This crisis has been a heavy blow. And many people should have a bad conscience for what has happened. Someone should be prosecuted, they have sucked Iceland dry, taken the money and ran, and left us totally in the shit. People I know who have gone to the UK or the US to study have found their grants worthless, they are stranded.' </p> <p>Like many his age, Tomasson has only a vague memory of harder times, before the boom that brought Iceland the highest per capita wealth in the world. Older islanders call them the 'Krutt-kynslotin' - the cuddly generation. Eco-aware, earnest but pampered, they drift from organic caf\u00e9 to bar, listening to the music of Bj\u00f6rk and Sigur R\u00f3s, islanders who have made it big abroad. 'They will have to get their hands dirty now,' says chef Siggi Hall, Iceland's answer to Gordon Ramsay, with an effusive vocabulary to match.</p> <p>'That's good though, they are the I-generation; iPods, iPhones, everything starts with I. Well, we will have to go back to the basics now. Icelanders are risk-takers, but hard working, they will have to downsize. We will have to eat haddock and Icelandic lamb and forget these imports of goose livers and Japanese soy sauce. When everyone was extremely rich in Iceland - you know, last month, it was with money that they never have earned. Now those who were extremely rich are just normally rich, but they think they are poor. They were spoilt, spending billions.'</p> <p>Hall is due to open his new restaurant on 17 October, but insists the crisis is not worrying him. 'I had been losing customers because people were flying off to Copenhagen and London and New York for the weekend, to eat out. Now they will stay in Iceland, but they will still eat out. People need to eat.'</p> <p>Outside the city's Hofdahollin car showroom, looking a little rumpled for men trying to sell new and used cars for \u00a335,000 and up, owner Runar Olafsson and his top salesman are sharing a Marlboro. They are not expecting any customers today. 'A few years ago we couldn't get enough top-end cars and we started importing them. We were selling 120, 140, a month. But it turned around so fast,' says Olafsson. 'It's so dramatic, just in one month. We have already seen two dealers go down.</p> <p>'Customers would come in and we would apply for credit online for them, a 100 per cent loan, and they can drive away in their new Range Rover. It took ten minutes, it was very easy. But 60 to 70 per cent of those loans were in foreign currency, Japanese yen or Swiss francs, and they have gone up 90 per cent as the krona burns. A car worth 5 million krona now has a 9 million loan on it; how are people going to make those payments?'</p> <p>Foreign currency loans are a problem for homeowners, too. 'Loans have been very cheap, house prices rose and there was a lot of good-quality housebuilding. But the building has halted, nothing is being finished, nothing is selling. The interest rates are staggering. What people are doing now is swapping houses if they want to go bigger or smaller. That is what is keeping us afloat,' says estate agent Ingolfur Gissurarson. His mobile goes off - the ringtone is A Hard Day's Night by the Beatles. 'I changed it to suit the times,' he smiles.</p> <p>Blame it on the Vikings. Icelanders like to hark back to their ancestors, the rebel Vikings who, as the nation's most revered daughter Bj\u00f6rk once explained, 'couldn't deal with authority in Norway. So they flew off in this mad ocean in a wooden boat which is pretty hardcore, North Atlantic in the year 800. And they found this island full of snow ... yeeeah!'</p> <p>'The Icelandic psyche is an important part of all of this,' says Hellgrimur Helgason, who writes an outspoken newspaper column which exposes feuds between Iceland's ruling class and its entrepreneurs. He is also the author of 101 Reykjavik, a popular novel populated by 'Krutt-kynslotin' characters. </p> <p>'Before the market reforms the country had stagnated, no one thought Icelanders could be businessmen. We were poor fishermen or farmers, so it had an incredible effect on confidence when we saw these young men out buying up British and Danish companies. Everyone grabbed at the new opportunities like children. Really, it was no surprise that Hamleys toy shop was one of the first purchases.'</p> <p>Gunnghilder Sveinbjarna and her friend, Anna Lara Magnusdottir, are ordering their second bottle of red wine in the Philippe Starck-designed interior of Reykjavik's Bar 5. Tonight the young women are feeling no pain.</p> <p>'We come out at the weekend to forget our children and our problems, and this time we will drink extra hard to make sure we forget the economic crisis too,' says Gunnghilder, raising a glass.

  "<p>Prudential is eyeing the Asian business that has been put up for sale by AIG, the US insurance giant, following its bail-out by the government last month.</p> <p>AIG confirmed on Friday that it planned to concentrate on its property and casualty general insurance business in the US and would also 'retain a continuing ownership' of its international life company, which is one of the largest players in the Asian market. </p> <p>But sell-offs from within this company, and from its life operations in the US, are needed to repay up to $85bn (\u00a348bn) borrowings from the US government.</p> <p>Prudential rivals AIG in Asia and it is keen to expand in the region, which is one of the fastest-growing markets for life and investment products.

  "<p>A crucial funding meeting chaired by Chancellor Alistair Darling, will next week hear proposals to nationalise the Olympic village.</p> <p>The move would create a \u00a3750m black hole in Olympic finances, putting pressure not just on the \u00a39.35bn budget for 2012, but also on other government departments to make up the shortfall.</p> <p>The ministerial meeting on 15 October will hear funding options from Partnerships UK, the Treasury agency. Other possibilities to be discussed include postponing a funding decision until bank debt becomes cheaper. A decision will be made at the end of the year.</p> <p>Current funding for the \u00a31bn development envisages Australian property giant Lend Lease, which built the Sydney Olympic facilities, committing \u00a3250m of its own money towards the cost with a similar amount coming from government. But Lend Lease has struggled this year to secure the remaining \u00a3500m from banks amid the worsening financial crisis and all the money might now have to come from government - in which eventuality it would take total control of the development.</p> <p>Lend Lease has a legally binding contract to fund the village that, according to Whitehall sources, expires in three months. The Olympic village is hard to finance because after the Games 3,200 homes in east London will go on the market simultaneously.

  "<p>Acres of newsprint and hours of television have been devoted to the GM crop controversy - quite an achievement for a foodstuff that is grown in no significant quantities in this country, or for that matter in this continent. Britain, like the rest of Europe, was long ago frightened away from producing and eating GM food by a media campaign that has been based mainly on hearsay and only marginally on science.</p> <p>And that is a shame. As senior scientists have pointed out, GM crops have considerable potential to help the planet, despite the claims of their opponents. Environment groups such as Greenpeace claim the stuff is dangerous. But not a single verifiable case of illness that has been triggered by GM produce has been established in the US, even though Americans have been eating genetically modified food since 1994 and 75 per cent of all processed foods in the US now contain a GM ingredient. Opponents claim there are long-term health risks but offer no concrete evidence.</p> <p>By contrast, the potential to improve human health is considerable, thanks to the dramatic power of modern molecular biology. To create a GM crop, a gene for a particular protein is extracted from an animal or another plant and then inserted in the DNA of that crop, where it directs its new host into making that protein. A classic example is provided by a modified sweetcorn called Bt corn, in which an insect-killing gene, extracted from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, is added to the DNA of sweetcorn so that it makes its own insecticide. Similarly, rice has been modified to contain high amounts of Vitamin A by inserting genes from daffodils and bacteria.</p> <p>And future benefits could be even greater. For example, scientists are developing GM bananas that would include a dose of hepatitis B vaccine. The potential here is vast. People in developing countries could be vaccinated against the disease - which now affects two billion people in developing countries - without needles or the need for cold storage of vaccines.</p> <p>Other projects being carried out by scientists include plans to strengthen crop resistance to drought. In a world afflicted by climate change, which is already causing deserts to spread to once fertile regions, GM crops such as these could be a bulwark against major famines - if they are given the chance.</p>",
  "<p>It has been 20 years since the last major biography of John Lennon, Albert Goldman\u2019s extravagantly spiteful The Lives of John Lennon. Before that there was veteran music writer Ray Coleman\u2019s Lennon: The Definitive Biography, published in 1984, which was respectful, going-on adulatory. Blessedly, Philip Norman opts for a tone that sits between the two, though the so-called revelations contained in his account often tend towards the prurient.</p> <p>Weighing in at around 500,000 words, John Lennon: The Life - note the definite article - tells a familiar tale in exhaustive but often illuminating detail. The book was written with the blessing of Yoko Ono and the tentative co-operation - by email - of Paul McCartney, though both are reported to be unhappy with the end result, which Ono claims is \u2018too mean\u2019 to Lennon\u2019s memory.</p> <p>Other key sources include George Martin, the Beatles\u2019 producer; Arthur Janov, the primal therapist who treated Lennon for a time in the Seventies; and Jimmy Tarbuck, the Scouse comedian and erstwhile teddy boy who attended Dovedale Primary School with him. Norman has also tracked down several long-lost childhood friends and ex-girlfriends, all of who testify to the young Lennon\u2019s rebellious but essentially vulnerable temperament. </p> <p>For me, the most fascinating section is the first third, which recounts Lennon\u2019s pre-stardom life in Liverpool and Hamburg. Norman is brilliant at evoking the postwar world from which the Beatles emerged and to which their unprecedented global success signalled the end. He vividly recreates Lennon\u2019s childhood in Liverpool, and his often tumultuous family environment, providing in the process what is the most rounded portrait to date of Lennon\u2019s wayward father, Alfred \u2018Freddie\u2019 Lennon. Freddie has long been caricatured as a feckless drifter but here emerges as a more complex man who deeply regretted abandoning his young son and who craved, but never received, John\u2019s forgiveness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/audio/2009/jan/14/beatles-john-lennon-biography\">Philip Norman: 'John Lennon influenced the 20th century in so many ways' \u2013 audio interview</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Norman is the first Lennon biographer to be granted access to the private papers of Lennon\u2019s celebrated Aunt Mimi, who took the troubled youngster in when his parents\u2019 ill-fated marriage finally imploded. He has also made good use of the notebooks the singer filled with his often scabrous musings and the cassettes on to which Lennon fitfully recorded his random thoughts, opinions and memories. The tabloids have already provided some invaluable pre-publicity for Norman\u2019s book by homing in on the \u2018revelation\u2019 that John may have harboured secret homosexual longings for Paul. Imagine! Macca, though, is having none of it. \u2018John never tried anything on,\u2019 he said recently. \u2018I slept with him a million times.\u2019 Lest there be any doubt about their laddishness, he added that had Lennon had \u2018a little gay tendency\u2019, he would \u2018have caught him out\u2019. </p> <p>There has been much conjecture about Lennon\u2019s sexuality in the past, most of it centred on his intense love-hate relationship with the Beatles\u2019 manager Brian Epstein. Norman refutes the oft-repeated rumour that the two slept together during a holiday in Spain in the summer of 1963. He concludes that Lennon\u2019s \u2018gay tendency\u2019 was aesthetic rather than carnal, and \u2018based on the principle that bohemians should try everything\u2019. </p> <p>The book\u2019s other big revelation, this time culled from a 1979 audio confession, is that, when he was a hormonally charged 14-year-old, Lennon harboured incestuous desires for his mother Julia. Her death in a car accident, when John was 17, was to haunt him for the rest of his life. Likewise, it would seem, the heightened moment in his adolescence when he lay down beside her and accidentally touched her breast. \u2018I was wondering if I should do anything else,\u2019 he mused later in a bout of post-therapy soul-baring. \u2018I always think I should have done it. Presumably she would have allowed it.\u2019 </p> <p>Though Norman does not pick up on it, it\u2019s the word \u2018presumably\u2019 that intrigues here. Did Lennon assume his mother had no moral scruples and would have reciprocated his advances? Or that her love for him was as fearsomely all-consuming as his for her? Or was it the case that he had transformed this fleeting moment of intimacy between them into something more transgressive in the emotional upheaval that followed her sudden death? Either way, Julia is an abiding presence in this book, just as she was in her son\u2019s life, having, in his eyes, abandoned him when she gave him up to the care of her childless sister Mimi and then died on him while he was still trying to come to terms with that first perceived betrayal. </p> <p>Though he always insisted that \u2018Help\u2019 was \u2018the only honest song I wrote\u2019, it is still deeply affecting to listen to the Freudian cri de coeur that is \u2018Mother\u2019 on his first solo album. It begins with the line: \u2018Mother, you had me, but I never had you\u2019 and is as naked an expression of hurt and longing as anything in popular music. </p> <p>That John Lennon was an emotionally tortured individual, often consumed by rage, unprocessed grief and a lifelong fear of abandonment, should come as no surprise to anyone who has paid close attention to his often brutally honest and occasionally self-lacerating songs. What emerges most strongly, though, from this epic trawl through Lennon\u2019s life is just how emotionally tortured he was for most of it and how his own demise was foreshadowed by the deaths of those closest to him: Julia, Epstein and his teenage soulmate and fellow bohemian Stuart Sutcliffe, who died at 21 from a brain haemorrhage in Hamburg in 1962. </p> <p>For a while, the music he made assuaged his demons, as did, fleetingly, his dalliances with LSD, heroin, alcohol, primal therapy and radical politics, all documented here in greater detail than before. Likewise, his complex and, for a while, all-consuming relationship with Yoko. The cruellest irony of Lennon\u2019s death at the hands of a devoted-to-the-point-of-unhinged fan is that it happened at a time when he seemed to have found a degree of contentment through the simple domestic pleasures of late fatherhood. How, one wonders, would he have fared with encroaching old age? </p> <p>Fittingly, it is Sean Lennon\u2019s testimony that provides the affecting postscript to this biography, which ends too abruptly at the moment of his father\u2019s death. I was left longing, though, after such a long and detailed account of John Lennon\u2019s life, for some reflection on the deeper meaning of that life, some sense of how, nearly 30 years after his death, he shaped the world we now live in. </p> <p>This is the best life of Lennon to date, however, if only for its brilliant evocation of his childhood in postwar England, that repressed and essentially Victorian society that shaped him and that he, more than any other British pop star, helped tear down.</p> <h2>John Lennon: In my life</h2> <p><strong>Born </strong>9 October 1940 in Liverpool.</p> <p><strong>1957 </strong>The Quarrymen, later the Beatles, formed. </p> <p><strong>1958 </strong>Julia Lennon killed in car crash. </p> <p><strong>1962 </strong>Married Cynthia Powell. </p> <p><strong>1963</strong> Julian Lennon born. </p> <p><strong>1967</strong> Brian Epstein dies.</p> <p><strong>1968</strong> Divorced Cynthia.</p> <p><strong>1969</strong> Married Yoko Ono; spent honeymoon in bed as peace protest. </p> <p><strong>1970 </strong>The Beatles split up.</p> <p><strong>1975</strong> Sean Lennon born. </p> <p><strong>Died </strong>8 December 1980 in New York, killed by Mark Chapman.</p> <p><strong>He said </strong>(in 1966): \u2018We\u2019re more popular than Jesus now.\u2019 </p> <p><strong>They said:</strong> \u2018The guitar\u2019s all very well, John, but you\u2019ll never make a living out of it\u2019 - Mimi Smith, Lennon\u2019s aunt.</p>",

He said, \"Right, you're sacked.\" I am prone, on occasions, to lapse into Anglo-Saxon language, so I said, \"You can fuck off - you're sacked.\" And he said, \"I own this club.\" I said, \"Do you? You can still fuck off. I ain't going anywhere.\" Six weeks later, he sacked me again. So I told him to fuck off again.'</p> <p>England manager Graham Taylor said 'fuck' 32 times in the fly-on-the-wall documentary that followed his team's failure to qualify for the 1994 World Cup, while unreconstructed Peterborough boss Barry Fry surpassed that before half-time in 1997's There's Only One Barry Fry. Now rehabilitated as a pre-watershed TV pundit, Taylor is still of the opinion that swearing is an integral part of the game. 'Football's an environment where saying, \"Please, number 10, would you mind kindly marking their player?\" doesn't really work,' he said in 2004. 'You have to put some language in.'</p> <p>You do wonder what Ars\u00e8ne Wenger would make of 'putting some language in' - maybe that's where he's been going wrong all these years. As for Irish Joe, we will start to find out this afternoon, when Newcastle play Everton, whether he is recreating Wimbledon's Crazy Gang spirit on the Tyne or if he's just another manager sent mad by the most heartbreaking job in British football.</p> <p>\u2022 Tim Lewis is the editor of Observer Sport Monthly</p>",

  "<p>Gordon Brown will propose a \u00a312bn fund to help small businesses survive the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> at a meeting of fellow European leaders today on how to tackle the problems currently crippling the financial markets. </p> <p>Speaking at Downing Street before his departure for Paris, Brown said: \"We are seeing, in addition to the national action we are taking, that these global problems about oil, about the credit crunch, need global solutions. </p> <p>\"I will be proposing a \u00a312bn small business fund, so that small businesses in our country and the rest of Europe can get money immediately so that they can continue to employ staff and continue to provide services.\" </p> <p>He also said he would discuss ways to make the financial markets more transparent. \"I will be proposing to the leaders I meet in Paris today that we work to clean up the system, both in American and Europe, where there have been problems.\" </p> <p>The meeting has been called by Nicolas Sarkozy, the French President, and comes amid mounting signs that the financial crisis that devastated Wall Street is spilling into the real economy and causing problems across Europe. </p> <p>Joining Brown and Sarkozy will be the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, as well as the Italy's Silvio Berlusconi, the head of the European Central bank and the president of the European Commission. </p> <p>But while politicians are desperate to stave off further financial meltdown, they are divided on what action to take. </p> <p>Last night, the US reluctantly passed a $700bn bail-out plan to buy up bad debts and restore confidence to the money markets. Similar plans have been mooted for Europe after a slew of banks ran in to financial difficulties.</p> <p>But the suggestion that member states contribute to a fund to be used when a key bank or financial institution gets in to trouble is failing to gain support among member states. The idea has been dismissed as unworkable by countries such as Germany and the UK. </p> <p>Today's meeting is instead likely to focus on ways of strengthening cooperation between countries in reacting to the banking crisis. </p> <p>Under discussion will be Ireland's decision to guarantee all deposits in the country's six largest banks, which has raised serious concerns among EU states. Britain, as well as other member states, are worried the plan gives Ireland an unfair competitive advantage and may break EU rules on a level playing field for businesses.</p>",
  "<p>Stuck between two of the most populous countries in the world who are growing rapidly, Nepal should in theory be benefiting from its strategic proximity to India and China. But the reality is somewhat different. It is one of the 10 poorest countries in the world, 90% of people live in villages where infrastructure and basic amenities are terrible, and political instability over the past two years or so has driven away many tourists \u2013 one of its main earners.</p> <p>I arrived at the capital, Kathmandu, a few days ago and immediately fell in love. In that, I'm not alone. There are not only thousands of backpackers and tourists here at any one time, but the number of people who keep coming back or want to volunteer here is exceptionally high. In fact there's even a word for the latter \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bravenewtraveler.com/2007/07/23/the-complete-guide-to-volunteer-tourism/\">volunteer tourism</a>.</p> <p>Nepal has character, it has great scenery, and it has a hell of a lot of international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working here. According to <a href=\"http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol7/issue2/montgomery.html\">one estimate</a>, their number jumped from around 220 in 1990 to possibly over 15,000 today.</p> <p>With a population of only around 29 million, you would think that given the amount of aid poured into the country, things would be much better. And yet infrastructure is woefully underdeveloped and the average life expectancy rate is appallingly low.</p> <p>I spoke to several aid workers here who were quite positive about the work being done in Nepal. But behind that optimism there is frustration and also an unwillingness to confront more difficult questions. </p> <p>For example, the number of NGOs and international NGOs in Nepal is so large that they comprise almost 60% of the country's gross national product (GNP). Without them the economy would collapse. Some estimate that volunteers alone contribute up to 5% of GNP.</p> <p>This brings up a whole list of questions and related problems. Given there is so much money flowing into Nepal, why hasn't the situation improved faster? Is there even a need for so many international NGOs?</p> <p>A recent article in <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12060397\">the Economist</a> pointed to similar problems with aid in Africa - lots of money coming in as aid but question marks over its effectiveness.</p> <p>Many, such as <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/?ito=1482&amp;gclid=CL7ixeGui5YCFQ1gQgodtWYREg\">Oxfam</a> and <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org.uk/index.asp\">Action Aid</a> have criticised governments in the past for not funding them and channeling the money directly to government projects or local Nepalese organisations.</p> <p>They argue that they have developed years of expertise to effectively deliver aid and services much more effectively than the government can. Indeed, in many ways the third sector is a more desirable channel of delivering services such as housing, food and health services because they are also less prone to corruption.</p> <p>But the flipside is that by developing their own parallel systems, the thousands of third sector organisations are not only replicating work done by each other, but also taking over the government's role. Surely it would be better over the long term that the Nepalese government itself develops the capacity and knowledge to provide the services it is meant to?</p> <p>Even worse, international agencies are also fond of flying in their own \"experts\" when needed, rather than developing and growing local expertise. As the old saying goes \u2013 give the man some fish and he can feed his family for a day; teach him how to fish and he can feed them for a lifetime.</p> <p>Even if the international NGOs are somewhat at fault, more blame can be laid at the door of massive donor countries such as the G8 \u2013 who provide a huge bulk of the money flowing into Nepal. Nepalese government officials quietly complain that they spend far too much time trying to manage the big donors and the projects those donors are running. </p> <p>The World Bank, always fond of lending money to developing countries to build <a href=\"http://www.newint.org/features/2004/03/01/environment/\">massive infrastructure projects</a> they don't need (contracted out to western companies of course) and contributing to their national debt, is a big part of the same problem too. The money is coming in but the Nepalese government is finding that it has to spend a significant amount of time adhering to their demands and \"managing donor business\" as one put it, rather than running domestic affairs.</p> <p>Tied aid is another big issue. The US government ties its own aid so that recipients such as Nepal are forced to spend a proportion of that money with those countries. As the Economist rightly points out, food aid from the US usually acts as a huge subsidy to American farmers, and even destroys local businesses. To top it off, the US government still considers Nepal to be run by terrorists even though this country is rapidly becoming more stable than it has ever been.</p> <p>People are loth to criticise developmental agencies and foreign aid because they result in good work, but measuring their effectiveness and improving that is a real problem.</p> <p>In some ways this is <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12060397,\">changing</a> but then there are social issues too. The trafficking of women from Nepal into India remains a huge problem but neither country is devoting many resources into dealing with it. Groups like <a href=\"http://www.developments.org.uk/articles/mighty-nepal/\">Mighty (Maiti) Nepal </a>are trying to address it but have been criticised themselves for their approach towards HIV-positive people, compared to the <a href=\"http://www.bds.org.np/\">Blue Diamond Society</a>. As with everywhere, women and minorities face major hurdles and even the aid agencies aren't doing enough to combat it.</p> <p>The international NGOs working in Nepal need to coordinate and realise that the country's future lies in the hands of local organisations, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAC_%28NGO%29\">Brac</a> and <a href=\"http://www.grameen.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=114\">Grameen Bank</a> in Bangladesh. The Nepalese people don't need charity \u2013 they need a helping hand to make this gorgeous country live up to its reputation.</p>",
  "<p>Wow, no one saw that coming. Peter Mandelson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/04/mandelson.gordonbrown\">is back for the third time</a>, but is it third time lucky? </p> <p>This is an audacious move, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/04/gordonbrown.mandelson\">will receive a mixed reaction</a> in the Labour party. The left and centre left will groan; the ultras will revel in his return. You may not like the man's politics, but this is a decisive politician \u2013 his ruthless effectiveness cannot be denied, something said to be lacking and much needed if Labour is to thwart Cameron and his crew.</p> <p>The media will delight in the return of a big gun to the political field, but my guess is that the response of Jo Public will be \"So what, I'm paying an extra tenner at the pump, the cost of my weekly shop has shot through the roof and I'm worried for my job, so what you gonna do?\"</p> <p>Inevitably, a reshuffle focuses on the personalities and the players, but it's the policies that matter and which will determine whether Labour scores and wins that much talked about fourth term. If the homecoming of Britain's EU commissioner represents a throwback to a tired, rusty, old formula designed to win votes in a bygone era, then the game is over; it is lost. But if this reshuffle represents a return in temperament to the bold, assured, pre October 2007 Brown of times past \u2013 the one who talked about the need to move on from Blairism \u2013 then the game is on.</p> <p>One person who has been forthright in arguing the case for a change of approach is Labour backbencher, Jon Cruddas, the former deputy leadership candidate and this year's conference darling. There <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/03/labour.reshuffle\">was much speculation</a> that he might be offered a post, but, regardless of whether any offer was forthcoming, Cruddas had always made it clear that his priority was not personal advancement but the people of Dagenham \u2013 and beating the far right there, a political breed that has always fed on the fear that comes with economic uncertainty. (And, if truth be told, his entry into government would have probably required some policy revision.)</p> <p>The elevation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband\">Ed Miliband</a>, from Cabinet fixer to bona fide secretary of state for Energy and Climate Change is significant. Unlike many of his political generation, Ed Miliband (like Cruddas) can give a speech and inspire. In many ways, he is far more impressive than his brother (as his own conference performance demonstrated) and he has grown in confidence. He has assiduously been going around the country canvassing opinion at a very local level on what should go into the next Labour manifesto, and has impressed with his openmindedness. But it's his politics that matter. </p> <p>It is common currency that this Miliband represents the social-democratic instincts of the PM. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/28/schools.labour\">his seminal Guardian piece on the Miliband family</a>, Andy Beckett noted that \"Ed was attracted to Brown's idea of using relatively small, highly technical but practical initiatives to redistribute wealth and reform the economy\" and his particular areas of responsibility when working for Brown at the Treasury were described as having a \"leftwing flavour\". Of course, Ed Miliband is no leftwinger and is more complicated than that description suggests. However, for those who believe in building a more equal, democratic and sustainable world, he is definitely on side. </p> <p>He has a growing base in the Labour party and now he has a department, so will he have the bottle to pick up the baton from where his brother left off and, say, push for personal carbon allowances? Will he strive to make the market work not only for social ends, but for the environment too? </p> <p>Who knows? Let's hope he grabs this opportunity to come out from behind his brother and beneath his master's shadow and become one of the big guns of a new political generation.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine the mess we'd be in, I found myself thinking, if the Labour party hadn't been wound up in 1983. It was one of those idle \"counterfactual\" reveries we historians indulge in during momentous events like our current crisis of capitalism. Remember that time 25 years ago when the British progressive left realigned, in the wake of Thatcher's second and most decisive general election victory. The 1980s seem so long ago, so it's worth recapping just what happened then, if only to put in sharper relief what might have happened since, had Britain become part of the \"new Europe\" outpost of American neoliberalism about to be thrown to the wolves of \"market readjustment\".</p> <p>Michael Foot resigned as Labour leader, still clutching <a href=\"http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/man/lab83.htm\">the longest suicide note in history</a>. Torn between hard left and demoralised right, Labour couldn't decide how to elect a new leader, let alone who it might be. The \"new realists\" in the trade unions, quick to spot a bad deal, decided they'd had enough. The curious historical phenomenon of Labourism \u2013 Britain's very own historic compromise between capitalism and the working class \u2013 had run its course. The unions withdrew their money and support from the old party, rendering it financially and organisationally unsustainable. As eminent historian Eric Hobsbawm pointed out, the social and cultural roots of Labour among the huge but essentially subordinate British working class had begun to wither at least 30 years before.</p> <p>It took a lot of painful haggling, but eventually a new Progressive Alliance took shape on the left, comprising the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDP-Liberal_Alliance\">SDP-Liberal Alliance</a> (excluding the Owenite \"social marketeers\", who were absorbed by the Thatcherites), Labour's \"democratic left\" around Bryan Gould, the small but influential \"Euro-communist\" wing of the Communist party, the \"realo-s\" of the Green party, and even some of the more thoughtful \"wet\" Tories. It was strongly pro-European, anti-nuclear weapons in principle but flexible on detail, committed to decentralisation of the public services and constitutional modernisation (including proportional representation for every election), and determined to make private business fulfil its social responsibilities. It recognised that the more populist elements of Thatcherism \u2013 council house sales, for example \u2013 would be difficult to reverse, but argued that they should be counterbalanced by policies to promote equality and social mobility, with an honestly redistributive tax system and Scandinavian-scale public spending and welfare.</p> <p>Thatcher won in 1987, at the height of City deregulation and the privatisation boom, but by 1992 the Tories were exhausted. The progressive alliance \u2013 confident in strategy, policies, image, local base and national leadership \u2013 was able to form a new government. The first few years were difficult, as powerful City and media interests did as much as they could to undermine it. But the government's programme of \"Red-Green Austerity\", with fairer distribution of wealth and resources and managed, environmentally-friendly reining-in of economic growth, and above all improved work-life balance, won overwhelming public support. People realised that a slower, gentler, more sociable way of life was much better than the rat-race of unbridled capitalism.</p> <p>The small rump of New Labour MPs from the old Labour heartlands was reduced to criticising the new government on the basis that, with its neo-protectionist economic policies, it couldn't bring Britain the benefits of globalisation. Their working class constituents \u2013 primary beneficiaries of the new quality of life \u2013 soon saw through that, and New Labour was forced to join the Progressive Alliance as a very junior partner. Gordon Brown was, briefly, a parliamentary under-secretary.</p> <p>Now look at the turmoil in \"new Europe\", and imagine how things might have turned out for us if the PA hadn't effectively quarantined the City of London from the real economy of Great Britain. Our revived and modernised manufacturing base, our rational and manageable housing market, our self-sufficient and nearly carbon-neutral energy and transport systems, our democratised and reinvigorated health and education services (with physical fitness, mental health and genuine educational achievement rising at historic rates across all ages and classes), our training-centred labour market and points-based immigration system, not to mention the broader cultural and social improvements in the way we regard and treat our fellow citizens, would all be at serious risk. Thank goodness \u2013 and the 1983 trade union \"new realists\" \u2013 that they're not.</p> <p><em>Is the future Conservative?, a debate by Comment is free &amp; Soundings magazine will take place in London at Kings Place on October 6 at 7pm.
