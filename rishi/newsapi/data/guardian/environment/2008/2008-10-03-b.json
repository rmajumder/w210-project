  "<p>Doomsday Men sets out to explain \"why some of the most gifted and idealistic men of the 20th century spent so much effort trying to destroy the planet\". PD Smith focuses on Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd, the Hungarian scientist who conducted the first nuclear chain reaction in Chicago in 1939, and the man who first urged President Roosevelt to build the atomic bomb. But this is more than the story of \"the greatest scientist never to have won a Nobel prize\": it is also a story of scientific potential, popular culture, cold war politics and the traffic between them. Smith shows how films, plays and books from The War of the Worlds to Dr Strangelove were inspired by scientific interest in a \"doomsday bomb\" and how, in turn, such narratives convinced political leaders that the price of global nuclear war was just too high. Doomsday Men's greatest strength is its ability to make scientific detail clearly understandable and to dramatise its role in larger stories. It also reminds us of the legacies of the atomic age: environmental damage and 30,000 weapons of mass destruction that definitely do exist.</p>",
  "<p>\"Literature is my vocation,\" says Mario Vargas Llosa, ever the gentleman in his crisp salmon-coloured shirt and sports blazer, \"but I've never liked the idea of being closed off in a world of fantasies. I like having one foot in the street.\"</p> <p>One of the leading lights of South American literature, he began his professional life as a 15-year-old crime reporter covering the seedy underworld of the Peruvian capital, Lima, for La Cronica, and continues to work as a journalist to this day, writing a regular column for the Spanish newspaper El Pais, on topics ranging from the Iraq war to the Russian invasion of Georgia. Though he's keen to insist on the distinction between journalism and literature, the time he spent pounding the streets is \"fundamental\" to his life as a writer.</p> <p>\"When I write, I write with freedom but I need a solid base,\" he explains.<br>It's a requirement that will see the 72-year-old writer travel to Congo later this year as part of the research for his next novel. The trip will allow him to \"get to know the scenery,\" he explains, \"to smell it, to feel it\", but above all will give him a \"bedrock of security that allows me to invent and to write. I'm not looking for historical precision but for something to shake me out of my insecurity.\"<br>He has always travelled for research, and finds that his experiences tend to dispel any prejudices he may have: \"I know that this will happen with Congo because I have read a lot about the area already and I know I will find something different when I am confronted with reality.\"</p> <p>He's following in the footsteps of Roger Casement, a British consul turned Irish nationalist who was hanged for treason in 1916 and painted as a paedophile by the British government for what he is said to have written in the so-called Black Diaries. Casement is to be the protagonist of \"a novel that will take place in Ireland, Congo, in Berlin and the Amazon, including places I have never been to, such as Ulster,\" he says, with genuine excitement at the prospect of the journey that awaits.</p> <p>\"Casement was born into a pro-British Protestant family in Ulster and as a boy was fascinated by the great British explorers, and with the idea of empire,\" says Vargas Llosa. \"He went to Africa as a 19-year-old but it was his experiences in Congo that changed him and made him a critic of empire, and an Irish nationalist. And yet at the same time he was a British consul, serving the empire.</p> <p>\"For some he was a hero, but for many people Casement was a villain. And there are still those in Ireland who view him uncomfortably because of his sexuality. There are many areas of shadow in his life, many aspects that are not clear and probably never will be because he was a very secret person, especially in his private life. There is a great debate about his homosexuality and paedophilia that has never been resolved and probably never will be \u2026 a highly contradictory character. Perfect for a novel.\"</p> <p>He is bullish about the prospect of treading on sensitive territory, both as a white man writing about Africa and a Peruvian writing about Anglo-Irish history, rejecting as racist itself the suggestion that he should not tackle these subjects. \"If we believed that,\" he says, \"we would only write about what goes on in our own households.\"</p> <p>When Vargas Llosa talks about his trip to Congo, his sense of the civic responibilities of the writer, as both novelist and journalist, is clear. Though he is planning a historical novel, it will have much to say about the present day.</p> <p>\"There are many things that haven't changed in Congo. It is one of the most tragic countries in the world, which endured a terrible colonial experience [at the hands of brutal Belgian king Leopold II]. And it has only got worse since,\" he says.</p> <p>\"It is calculated that in the last 10 years four to five million people have been killed in Congo, yet it barely gets reported in the newspapers. In many ways the Congolese are still living with the same problems they faced in the era of Conrad and Casement.\"</p> <p>Ever since his days as a cub reporter, Vargas Llosa's vision has been turned outwards. His conversion from supporter of Fidel Castro's revolution to an advocate of free-market capitalism was crowned with a failed bid to become president of Peru in 1990, running on a ticket inspired by his political idol, Margaret Thatcher. And now, even in the midst of a global banking crisis he is prepared to defend the market, suggesting that \"no liberal economist has denied the importance of state intervention\".</p> <p>\"Neo-liberalism is not an ideology, but a doctrine,\" he says. \"It doesn't impose itself on the facts, but rather adapts to reality. In certain circumstances, a small amount of state intervention is not just legitimate but indispensable.\"</p> <p>He is not blind to the excesses of the kind of turbo capitalism that caused the markets to tumble and banks to fold, admitting it \"clearly isn't fair that taxpayers, who haven't caused the problem, will have to pay for it with increased taxes and mortgages\", but argues that Europeans are well-placed to survive the fallout.</p> <p>\"The EU has helped Europe defend itself ... without the euro, this crisis would have hurt Europe much more.\"</p> <p>Vargas Llosa has never been one to shy away from controversy: despite initially opposing the invasion, he switched sides to support the Iraq war after a visit in 2003. It's a line he still maintains despite the horrors of the war, saying that the \"[it] has been tragic, but the balance is not entirely negative\".</p> <p>\"For the first time [Iraq] has an elected government,\" he says. \"My impression is that a Saddam Hussein figure could not return. And I believe that Iraq is advancing towards some kind of pluralistic democracy.\"</p> <p>He relishes the prospect of democratic change in the US and the UK, coming out for the \"generational change\" that Barack Obama represents \u2013 \"I believe it would be a great thing for the US to vote a black man into the White House\" \u2013 and displaying no great sadness at the end of the new Labour era, despite his admiration for Thatcher's \"true disciple\", Tony Blair.</p> <p>\"If you believe in democracy, you believe in the idea of an alternative,\" he says. \"This is a commonplace idea in the UK, which is the most democratic of the many countries I have lived in. Democracy is not just the insititutions, but also a spirit.\"</p> <p>It's a spirit he feels is still under threat in Latin America, where he says leaders from Hugo Chavez in Venezuela to Evo Morales in Bolivia are \"like a broken record that repeats the same concepts, the same clich\u00e9s and phobias, the same politics\". He's more supportive of what he describes as the \"democratic left\", such as Lula in Brazil and Michelle Bachelet in Chile, arguing that what has changed since his youth is the appetite of the US to meddle in Latin affairs. As the state department's attention turns to Iraq, the Middle East and the rise of China, there is hope that Latin America will be left to plot its own destiny.<br>As for Chavez and Morales, they are sure to inspire a new generation of novelists, and will have to wait the judgment of literature.</p> <p>\"The book about Chavez will come at some point,\" he says. \"Just give the Venezuelans time to assimilate him.\"</p>",
  "<p>I'd never really given Jimmy Greaves's maxim, \"It's a funny ol' game\", the contemplation it deserved; foolishly, I'd taken it to be a kind of idiomatic twitch, an unconsidered exhalation merely filling time till Ian St John could up the gravitas with some furrow-browed analysis. On reflection, and from the vantage point of 2008, through my retrospect-ulars I see that it is a line worthy of Lao-Tse, for the game is indeed both funny ha ha and funny peculiar. Not to mention \"ol'\".</p> <p>I have already, necessarily, addressed the difficulty of communicating the preposterous complexities of this season's high farce to Americans - Saudi takeovers, Geordie messiahs, millionaire footballers hidden under blankets and \"Profanity\" Joe Kinnear. Now I must endeavour to comprehend the madness of Hull's victory and Sol Campbell's lyrical character assassination, but primarily Joe's (my brilliant \"Joke in 'ere\" nickname has not garnered the support I would've liked - I'd assumed it'd be the new X Factor or iPod) carnival of cursing is the most arresting of the week's events.</p> <p>The raw humanity of the cussing is what makes it interesting, Joe has truly stripped all subterfuge and mystery from communication - his press conference breakdown has exposed the tension at the heart of the relationship between the press and those who they write about. Naturally I shall be cautious as the incident has revealed Kinnear to be deeply confrontational and suggests he may be litigious - also I've had personal experience of media acrimony and know that it can be bloody annoying when the press coat you off, or misrepresent you or simply don't like you - but judging from the transcripts the journalists present were perfectly reasonable, unless their measured contributions were delivered in mocking, sarcastic voices...</p> <p><strong>Journalist</strong> Have you read the copy? It doesn't say the players won't turn up.</p> <p><strong>JK</strong> You're a cunt ... also you're doing a cruel \"mong\" voice. Pack it in.</p> <p>Obviously I'm paraphrasing and the idea that the reporters present were doing silly voices is pure conjecture. What this press conference and Kinnear's agitation reveal is that he failed to anticipate the kind of environment he was going into. He can't have thought that managing Newcastle for a brief period at a time of crisis when the fans are demanding either Christ, Shearer or Keegan would be the footballing equivalent of a Chas &amp; Dave record; surely he must've expected scrutiny and pressure? </p> <p>I identify with the craving to lash out at journalists, though. Just yesterday some snooty prig was straining out weak humour in a telephone interview I'd agreed to and I thought, 'Why am I tolerating this when I could simply find out their place of residence and dash out their brain with an onyx lamp?' But that would achieve nothing.</p> <p>Kinnear's authenticity in this instance is comparable to Kevin Keegan's famous \"I'd love it\" moment where he, brimming with passion and indignation, allowed Alex Ferguson to psychologically topple his side from the Premiership summit. But this occurred at a time when he was already treasured; Kinnear only turned up a week ago. It's like finding out that, against your wishes, a lodger is moving in, then learning on the first night that he's a flatulent drunk who won't let anyone else use the remote control.</p> <p>After a good 20 minutes of what must've been a very difficult situation a Newcastle press officer tried to salvage something by insisting that they \"talk football\", but by then the damage had been done and the pungent stink of swearwords and conflict must've been stifling - only a lapdance, a firework or a spontaneous romance could've rescued the situation and what was offered instead was the question: \"How's training going?\"</p> <p>I had car journeys like that as a child - after monumental tiffs with loathed step-parents some cove would try and resurrect the atmosphere with a pleasantry. But there's little that can be done. What I would dispute is Kinnear's insistence that Newcastle United are disliked. I think people feel great affection for Newcastle, accepting that they have special significance in the hearts of their fans and generally wishing them well.</p> <p>I think the same is true of Kinnear: people don't dislike him, it's just the situation seems a bit daft. If you're reading this Joe, heed Greavsie's wisdom and lighten up. And don't Google yourself for a while.</p>",
  "<p>Colonsay was my favourite place. To be specific, a flat rocky outcrop in a field outside a white cottage called Uragaig, at the top of a hill gazing down over Kiloran Bay to the sea, was my favourite place. Every year I counted down the days until I could be sitting by myself on my rock again. Clearly this passed for entertainment in my world. The tiny Hebridean island, all 17 square miles of it, was my continent of childhood bliss. I learned to swim in the large rock pool in Kiloran's shore, under cliffs of overhanging slate, with purple sea anemones under my toes and the frightening waves far out beyond this calm still water. I went to my first ceilidh in the village hall that, strangely, had no village attached to it, but sat by itself in the middle of a meadow along the road. The last time we went to Colonsay, I was seven years old and it was 1983. Electricity had still not reached Uragaig; the rooms were lit by gas lamps. But for skint families like ours (bringing up five children on my father's picturesque salary as a wildlife conservationist), it was the South of France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338259502\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/02/SophieCookFamily220.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Cook and family\" width=\"220\" height=\"175\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Cook and family. Photograph: Sophie Cook</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Cook/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Revisiting the landscape of the past is a dangerous affair. Memories and photographs might behave themselves, stay properly isolated and preserved, but real physical places enjoy no such quarantine from the present. And then, even if it has not altered beyond recognition without my permission, I always wonder if going back to the scene of some long-ago happy occasion won't somehow destroy the past that happened there by writing over it. </p> <p>I already knew that the old inn near the pier had turned into the boutique Colonsay Hotel, decorated in various sophisticated shades of blue and grey, because I had visited its website. But walking in from the terrace, it seemed to have grown up even more than I had. It was filled with knowing references to the past - the black and white framed photographs of long-lost crofters, and of the original inn, hardly changed from the outside; and with self-conscious nods to its own rustic identity - the naked floorboards, the wall of logs. Perhaps there is nothing strange in a place learning to present itself as a more clearly enunciated version of what it has always been anyway - picturesque, old, remote. The same thing has happened in many hotels across Scotland. It is just a little like seeing a beautiful tomboy you have known all your life, dressed as a woman and wearing make-up. So I was weirdly thankful to find a battered old chess set and a vast stash of trashy 1950s pulp fiction paperbacks in the otherwise impeccably perfect drawing room. The Colonsay may be the sort of place to make Kelly Hoppen swoon, but it is also a charming and welcoming place to stay, with fantastic food in the restaurant: the oysters were so fresh they gave me a head-rush, and I slept like a baby in the new expensive beds.</p> <p>Uragaig cottage is still available at very affordable rents, and I had arranged to spend the rest of my week back in my childhood holiday haunt. I drove there with a nervousness that was not entirely due to the hairpin bends on the single-track roads. At first, I couldn't find the house, because my old rock had disappeared from outside it, the close-cropped meadow of my memories being overgrown with brambles and bracken, the view to the sea obscured by willows and bindweed. Inside the old croft, I found not only electricity but also newfangled attractions such as a cafetiere and a dishwasher in the kitchen. Still, the cooker was reassuringly wonky, and when I came to the wooden stairs, steep as a loft ladder, and the upstairs balustrade under the eaves where my sister and I used to hide and run, I was suddenly back in my fetching red flared dungarees, and she was definitely not a mortgage broker in the habit of jetting off to Monaco. The house had shrunk around me to a quarter of the size it ought to be, but if I crouched down low enough it was as if I could tumble backwards down the Alice in Wonderland rabbit-hole. </p> <p>I went skinny-dipping in my old rock pool, which this year's storms had helpfully carved out deeper from the sand so that it was still exactly the right size for swimming. Under the same soaring strata of slate studded with limpets, with the purple flora underwater, it was bliss to duck and splash with the low cold September mist rolling over my skin and the ocean breaking beyond. The only thing that had changed was the length of my body, and my predilection for dark purple toenail polish which, luckily, toned with the anemones: Kelly Hoppen would surely approve. </p> <p>My friend Vero and I had come to Colonsay partly to see Ceol Cholasa, the island's first ever folk festival. The Hebrides have a long connection with folk, cemented by Donovan's 1960s commune on Skye, and Vashti Bunyan's trek to get there. But Colonsay also has preternaturally strong musical gifts of its own, and I am glad we didn't miss the first night, devoted to islanders. Their songs were at times achingly hilarious, at times deeply moving. It is unusual to hear people sing about how much they love the landscapes they've grown up in: the likes of Donald MacNeill, or his cousins, the Machrin MacNeills, with Song in my Heart and Home to Colonsay. But then, the island has lost so many of its people to migrations that perhaps the economic precariousness of life here makes the bond stronger for those who remain. As Donald said to me, \"You have to love the island to want to live here. Because it's nearly impossible.\" </p> <p>The Friday ferry brought van-loads of accordions, guitars, and high-profile folk musicians from the mainland, as well as disgorging a large number of music fans, including my mother. There were afternoon sessions in the pub - the bar of the hotel - where everyone joined in for a jam, and where I mainly ate a great deal of gourmet chips while being blown away by Jen MacNeill's and Anna MacDonald's singing. We passed the Anna Massie Band trashing their kite on the sand, and wandered up and down the odd hill in between sessions, or curled up with books by the fire, depending on the water content of the mist. A young family was picnicking on the beach, complete with plaintive toddler, rubber dinghy, digging dog - although the father, in a sorry reflection of the decline of modern masculinity, was wearing a short-sleeved wetsuit to go swimming. In the evenings, talented performers like Karine Polwart played and sang on the stage of the packed-out village hall (now relocated to the actual village, Scalasaig) and after midnight the Colonsay Ceilidh Band fiddled away as we all stamped and tumbled round the floor. There was delicious Colonsay beer on tap from the local brewery and an enterprising teenager selling overpriced egg rolls, which gladdened my heart - perhaps she is one of the ones who will manage to stay. In between dances on Saturday night, Collum from the shop introduced me to Andrew, who had heard I was looking for oysters. We went out to his van, and I bought a dozen for six pounds, fresh from the oyster beds that morning, along with a jar of honey from his hives in the heather out by the standing stones. The sky was littered with stars, and the party went on at Garvard farm until breakfast-time, though I was tucked up long before that. When the Sunday ferry took everyone away again, the island was eerily quiet.</p> <p>One of the strange things about returning here with an adult consciousness was knowing that Uragaig is not just my seasonal residence, but was once the everyday home of the MacDougalls who crofted it. Colonsay has 108 permanent residents, and 500 extra beds which are only filled in summertime, many of them in these old crofters' cottages owned by Colonsay House Estate. Walter, who I remember from childhood as the man with the chickens and the Calor gas, still lives down the road and works his croft, although he's in his 70s now. Mum and I went down there again to buy eggs. He can still recall a time when all the holiday cottages were working crofts, and while nobody doubts the economic logic behind the change, it is impossible not to feel deeply sad about what threatens to be the second passing away of a hard but beautiful way of life. </p> <p>There is a ruined priory on Oronsay, a tidal island connected to Colonsay twice a day by a broad stretch of sand. The monks who lived here 500 years ago kept the skulls of their dead brethren on the inner window sills of their abbey. On Monday, I went back there, munching bakewell tart from May's Pantry in Scalasaig, clouds of linnets rising out of the heather ahead of me. The serried heads of the brave and macabre congregation that so impressed me as a kid had all been taken away, the long grass mown, paths put in, loose stones cemented down with hems of modern masonry. </p> <p>By contrast, Colonsay House Gardens have escaped the secateurs entirely. The woodland is open seven days a week: we wandered in from the lane and found our own way round the overgrown pathways between its dense forest of magnolias, giant fuschia, and rhododendrons, pines and palms, all cosseted in the mild climate of the Gulf Stream. Emerging on to a wooden footbridge from between overarching giant rhubarbs twice as tall as me, I found the lake my father helped to clear, now half-green with waterlilies and pondweed, half-silver with fallen eucalyptus leaves. While the cottage had shrunk around me with the passage of time, here in the garden everything had grown riotously upwards and away, leaving me smaller, not larger, than before. It was a beautiful, impossibly romantic place; it made me think of our own memories, how we polish some of them to a false perfection, like that sanitised priory, and let others fend for themselves in darkly overgrown forgetfulness, like these neglected garden trees, colossal and almost unseen except for the flowers they still fling down, from time to time, uninvited.</p> <p>I walked down to Kiloran Bay as the sun was coming up, the mist completely cleared, not another human soul on the long curve of sand. I swam in the glassy green Atlantic breakers, dived through the tall walls of water; the sun rising over the machair on landside was shattering the battered surf silver. High tide and a sunrise: some things on Colonsay never change. I found my old rock, afterwards, amid the furze. Sitting there nursing a coffee, I realised it was still my favourite place on Earth, even if the view was not what it used to be. Perhaps this was partly because I had discovered I am tall enough to still see the old view too, by the simple expedient of standing up. Perhaps I was just enjoying sitting there listening to the invisible ocean with my eyes shut.</p> <p>\u2022 Sophie Cooke is the author of The Glass House and Under the Mountain (published by Arrow Books).</p> <h2>Way to go</h2> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p>Caledonian MacBrayne Ferries (0800 066 5000, <a href=\"http://www.calmac.co.uk\">calmac.co.uk</a>) has regular ferries from Oban year-round, with an extra summer service from Kennacraig.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong></p> <p>The Colonsay Hotel (01951 200316, <a href=\"http://www.thecolonsay.com\">thecolonsay.com</a>) doubles from \u00a385 per night.

  "<p>If some degree of truth can indeed be attached to the old Scots saying that if there's \"nae wind its nae gowf,\" then the second day of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship provided \"perfectly difficult\" conditions for Caledonia's national sport. With a stiff and chilly northerly blowing, only a handful of players broke 70 on any of the three courses - St Andrews, Carnoustie and Kingsbarns.</p> <p>There were, of course, exceptions to the prevailing struggles. And, as one would expect in such a trying environment, it was the better ball-strikers who thrived. Although the relatively anonymous Markus Brier leads on eight under par for the 36 holes played, piled up behind the Austrian is a large group filled with potential winners of the \u00a3432,970 first prize.</p> <p>All within three shots of the leaders are the major champions Padraig Harrington and Michael Campbell, as many as five Ryder Cup players past and present in Lee Westwood, Soren Hansen, Jarmo Sandelin, Robert Karlsson and David Howell, and a pair of the game's most promising young players, Martin Kaymer and Rory McIlroy. With two rounds to go in weather that promises to be even worse than that the players have already suffered, the sprightliness and suppleness of youth is likely to prosper.</p> <p>The round of the day was surely that shot by McIlroy, who finished third in this event 12 months ago. Playing Carnoustie, where last year he won the silver medal as the leading amateur in the Open championship, the 19-year-old Ulsterman nipped round in 69 blows. He was the only man to shoot in the 60s over the brutally difficult Angus links.</p> <p>\"I'd love to repeat what I did last year and even go a bit better,\" he said. \"But I need to get into position first to have a chance to win. If I do, my recent experience in Switzerland [where he lost in a sudden-death play-off] will help.\"</p> <p>In the Pro-am event running alongside the professionals' more serious business, the singer Ronan Keating and Graeme Storm lead on 16 under par, one shot clear of Sir Ian Botham and his partner, Howell.</p>",
  "<p>On my 18th birthday, the marketing department of the Gillette Company sent me a surprise gift: a SensorExcel razor. Back then, in the mesozoic era of razor blade development (circa 1995), the SensorExcel was the latest in state-of-the-art swizziness, with its five \"soft, flexible microfins\" which stretched the skin and caused the beard hairs to perk up like so many unwary soldiers poking their heads over the parapet, all the easier to be mown down by the two spring-mounted blades following fast behind. These days, the SensorExcel is a quaint museum piece, having been superseded by razors with first three, then four and now five blades, not to mention all the other add-ons: lubricating strips, pivoting heads, low-friction blade coatings, battery-powered vibrations, trimmers and even microchips.</p> <p>The three-bladed Gillette Mach3 was introduced in 1998; Wilkinson Sword (Schick in the US) upped the ante with the four-bladed Quattro in 2003. In February 2004, the satirical online newspaper the Onion ran a spoof article, supposedly by the CEO of Gillette, under the headline Fuck Everything, We're Doing Five Blades. Sure enough, a couple of years later, they did: the Fusion. The Economist, a magazine not normally inclined to scoff at those cornerstones of market capitalism, innovation and growth, took a leaf out of the Onion's book and ran a semi-humorous article suggesting that, if current trends continue, \"blade hyperdrive will be reached in the next few years\". A pseudoscientific graph showed the number of blades shooting hyperbolically off the chart before 2020.</p> <p>But just what is it about adding blades that makes a razor better? And is it simply a question of adding blades? If so, how hard can it be? Do the companies already have six-, seven-, eight-, nine- and 10-bladed razors ready and waiting to be rolled off the production line whenever they feel they're slipping behind in the arms race? Shaving is serious business: in the UK alone, men spend more than a quarter of a billion pounds a year on razors and blades. That market is dominated by Gillette, which claims a 79.8% value share. That's 79.8% of the money, rather than of the number of razors: one reason for the disparity is that Fusion blades cost twice as much as Quattro refills.</p> <p>Neither Gillette nor Wilkinson Sword would reveal the size of their annual research and development budget. But in 2005, Peter Hoffman, then the president of Gillette's blades and razors division, told BusinessWeek that the development of the Fusion cost slightly less than the $680m they'd spent on creating the Mach3 a decade earlier. Whether this is a lot more than, a lot less than or about the same as Procter &amp; Gamble spend on developing a new line of Always sanitary towels or Olay face creams is a secret they're keeping to themselves.</p> <p>The company was founded by the American entrepreneur King Camp Gillette in 1901 to mass-produce the disposable-blade safety razors he'd invented, for which he obtained a patent in 1904. Gillette is often credited as the inventor of the safety razor, though it had actually been around in various forms since the mid-19th century. His real innovation was the \"razor and blades business model\", also less politely known as \"freebie marketing\": give away the durable handles, flog the disposable blades (or \"cartridges\", as the modern multibladed razor heads are called in the trade). The company still relies on the model, as evidenced by my 18th birthday present. It's highly effective, and seems almost insultingly simple. The catch is that it also depends on technical innovation: freebie marketing wouldn't have worked for King Gillette if he hadn't come up with an affordable way to manufacture the blades.</p> <p>Since the days of its founder, Gillette's headquarters have been in Boston, Massachusetts. In 2005, the company was bought for $57bn by Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer goods behemoth based in Cincinnati, Ohio. (Wilkinson Sword gets passed around a bit, too: in 2003, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer sold it to the battery manufacturer Energizer Holdings.) The Gillette Technology Centre, however, is tucked away on an industrial estate between the A33 and the Old Basingstoke Road in Reading, Berkshire. It's an overcast morning in late summer when I pull into the visitors' car park, opposite the dozen or so spaces reserved for \"shave test panellists\", for a tour.</p> <p>\"I'm going to challenge you as you walk around,\" says the friendly, enthusiastic and clean-shaven lab director, Kevin Powell, \"to find the group that is actually tasked with adding blades.\" He laughs. \"That's the first question I normally get when I go to a cocktail party. Ho ho ho. Did you add some more blades today?\" He shows me a patent from the 30s for an unwieldy, five-bladed razor that looks as if it wouldn't have been out of place in a medieval torture chamber. \"It must have been excruciatingly uncomfortable,\" he says. \"Just adding blades most certainly doesn't do it.\" He prefers to talk about the shaving \"surface\", a term Gillette trademarked, though it's hard not to see that as a semantic dodge to flummox the cocktail-party piss-takers. The surface does, after all, consist of a (growing) number of blades.</p> <p>Anne Stewart, the centre's director for science, explains the thinking behind multiblade razors. It's all down to \"a phenomenon we refer to as hysteresis\". According to the Chambers Dictionary, hysteresis is \"the retardation or lagging of an effect behind the cause of the effect\", or \"the influence of earlier treatment of a body on its subsequent reaction\". In shaving terms, this means that when a razor blade encounters a hair, it doesn't only cut through it, it also pulls it a little way out of its follicle. So if there's another blade following close behind, it will slice into the hair lower down the shaft, before it has had time to retract into the follicle. \"You've actually shaved below the skin level,\" Stewart says. \"Can you ever get a closer shave with a single-edge cut-throat razor? In a stroke, no.\" Wilkinson Sword agree that the benefit of several blades is \"closeness - in the case of Quattro with no compromise on safety\".</p> <p>In the high-speed filming lab, I watch magnified, slow-motion footage of a five-bladed Fusion cartridge sliding down a few millimetres of anonymous cheek. The first blade strikes a hair, slices into it, tugs it out; the second blade hits, slices again, drags the hair out even farther; the third blade strikes, then the fourth, then the fifth, each nicking off a chunk of the hair, though a smaller fraction each time. Adding blades, then, does lead to a closer shave, if with diminishing returns. But it's not simply a question of how many blades you have in your cartridge.</p> <p>\"The spacing between the blades is critically important,\" Stewart says. Too close together and you could get two blades in the hair at the same time, which would apply too much force to the hair and be painful. There also wouldn't be enough room between the blades for the debris to be rinsed through and the cartridge would get clogged. Too far apart and the hair will have retracted into the follicle before the second blade gets its chance to bite. There's also the danger that the skin will fold into too big a bulge between the blades: \"And that causes skin discomfort and irritation as you come through.\" Finally, the larger the surface, the greater the drag, which again leads to discomfort. So the challenge was to fit five sharp enough, strong enough blades, with enough space between them, into a small enough area, to give a noticeably closer, more comfortable shave. \"In terms of pushing the technology,\" Stewart says, \"being able to weld the blades on the small blade supports was a real key enabler.\" </p> <p>The prototypical five-bladed surface - codename: Surf - was \"tested on literally thousands of men,\" Powell says. \"Did that surface wow them? Unequivocally, yes.\"</p> <p>There's more to the Fusion, however, than the five-bladed shaving surfaceTM. On the back of the cartridge there's a sixth blade, a single \"precision trimmer\", for doing trickier areas, such as under the nose, and to get nice, straight edges on your sideburns or goatee. The Wilkinson Sword Quattro Titanium, a jazzed-up version of the Quattro introduced last year, in part, no doubt, as a response to Gillette's Fusion, has an edging blade on the back, too. With the Mach3, \"there was a very low level consumer complaint\", Stewart says, \"with a high level of frustration, about being able to trim.\" This is the downside of adding blades and creating surfaces: it's hard to cut a straight line with a plane rather than an edge. And once they've experienced the simple joys of an unpivoted single blade - ironically enough, the same principle as the cheapest kind of disposable razor - there's no going back for Gillette's guinea pigs. When making a prototype, Powell says, \"sometimes it's easier for us to try to do it without putting a trimmer on the back. It's a revolt. They go: 'I can't do that!' \"</p> <p>\"They\" are the shave test panellists, the 80 men who go to the technology centre five mornings a week, 50 weeks a year, to have their daily shave with one of Gillette's experimental prototypes. The \"consumer testing facility\" is in a separate building from the research and development labs. As we walk from one to the other, Powell says, \"We are very much on lockdown because, let's face it, there's a huge amount of commercial potential locked up in there.\" He pointed back at the main building. \"But a lot of these ideas, although clearly we prosecute for patents - you know, we apply for patents - but nonetheless a lot of those things haven't even started yet. So there's a complete lockdown.\" The Fusion system has more than 70 patents registered on it; the Wilkinson Sword Quattro range has more than 100.</p> <p>The consumer testing facility smells strongly of shaving foam. When the panellists arrive, they have to check in - there's a \"pin verification system\" to exclude interlopers - then each is given his \"shave box\" with the day's razor in it and a barcode that has to be scanned, to make sure everyone gets the right box. \"The one thing you want absolutely to ensure is there's never an opportunity for somebody to shave somebody else's razor, from a cross-contamination point of view.\" (Powell talks about \"shaving a razor\", rather than \"shaving with a razor\", so that, grammatically speaking, the direct object of the verb is the razor, not the face. Though it probably wouldn't be fair to read too much into the idiom.) The panellists are closely observed as they shave and afterwards fill out questionnaires. I ask if they're paid. \"Yes, they are,\" Stewart says. \"Incentivised,\" interjects Jennie Larby, who's in charge of the facility. They don't tell me the size of the incentives.</p> <p>One of the panellists has volunteered to give a shaving demonstration. I watch him through a two-way mirror, video cameras trained on him over my shoulders. It's a strange, unsettling experience to look into a mirror and see another man shaving. He leans in close, turns his face this way, then that, stretches the skin of his cheek with his left hand while scraping at it with the razor in his right, pulls clownish expressions to tighten the muscles, seems to be peering intently into my eyes. I want to look away, but I can't. I make a joke about putting the videos on YouTube. Powell laughs politely, and says they take the panellists' privacy very seriously.</p> <p>\"It was only when I came here that I realised I'd been married to my husband for so long and I'd never watched him shaving,\" says Kristina Vanoosthuyze, one of Gillette's senior scientists. \"I stood next to him. 'How are you shaving exactly?' \"</p> <p>Stewart, too, takes a professional interest in her other half's grooming habits: \"After a while, he says, 'Do you know what? Can I just shave without you asking?' \" Vanoosthuyze's husband eventually told her to \"Go away and leave me alone!\" she jokes.</p> <p>Powell brings the conversation back to the matter in hand. \"You can never spend too much time with consumers,\" he says. \"It's amazing what you will learn from them.\"</p> <p>Down the hall from the high-speed video lab is the room where they do three-dimensional motion analysis using infrared cameras: \"It's the same system they use in some of the latest blockbusters, like Spider-Man or Lord Of The Rings.\" The changing positions of markers that reflect infrared light are triangulated by the cameras, so the movements of the razor and the shaver's arm can be recreated in a virtual 3D space on a computer. \"The way in which you hold that handle and you rotate that handle, if you watch men do it, it's quite amazing. You think they could all be cheerleaders,\" Stewart says. High-speed infrared cameras, running at around 2,000 frames a second, are also used to measure skin deformation and strain. A similar technique is used in the car and aeroplane industries, though Gillette have patented it for shaving research. Next door, sensors in a specially adapted razor measure the forces different men put on it while shaving.</p> <p>Analysis of all the data from all the different studies gives the researchers an idea of where there might be room for improvement, so the next stage is to build a new prototype the panellists can try out to see if it's any better. The razors are built virtually at first, using computer-aided design. These models are then turned into physical ones downstairs in the rapid prototyping area. The models are made by building up very, very thin layers of plastic, one on top of another. Dom Piff points to the work going on in one of his machines. \"That's a very large part for us,\" he says. \"It's like trying to cut Wembley football turf with an eight-inch blade.\" His fastest machine is the 3D printer, \"which is kind of like precision bombing\". Eight printheads, with 97 nozzles on each, pass from left to right, spitting out a liquid polymer that is instantly solidified by the ultraviolet light following behind. It makes a noise like a desktop computer printer, only louder. Piff gives me a souvenir: a blown-up plastic model of a Fusion cartridge with my name engraved on it.</p> <p>The machines that cut the metal parts in the working prototypes are accurate to within plus or minus 1.5 microns (thousandths of a millimetre). \"This is levels of accuracy greater than the watch-making industry,\" Stewart shouts over the noise of the equipment. \"More in among the medical industry.\" The incredible levels of precision have been emphasised all the way round the facility. Presumably that's the subtext of using Roger Federer, Tiger Woods and Thierry Henry in the Fusion ad campaign: here's a combination of more precision and accuracy than you know what to do with. \"If you take away only the one thing,\" Powell says, \"that's precision. And the consumer. That's it.\"</p> <p>You could be forgiven for thinking magnification was a major theme, too. Using a device called a micro-watcher, I was able to inspect my chin at 200 times lifesize. I hadn't shaved for a couple of days. The hairs looked revolting, the black ones like great greasy sticks of liquorice, the pale ones like shards of dirty glass. In the electron microscope area, there are pictures on the wall of various blade edges enlarged thousands of times: kitchen scissors, a kitchen knife, a surgical scalpel, a Fusion blade. Guess which is the sharpest. \"To be fair, the surgical scalpel is being asked to do a different task,\" Powell says.</p> <p>Each blade in a Fusion cartridge consists of a stainless steel core, coated with very thin layers of diamond-like carbon, for strength, and a Teflon-like polymer to reduce friction. I ask about planned obsolescence: a razor blade that never went blunt would be bad news for the industry. Stewart's answer implies that the idea of an unbluntable razor is a fantasy. \"You clearly don't want something that's fantastic but lasts one shave, because clearly that's not great for the shaver.\" I think this means you can't have both maximum sharpness and maximum durability, so you need to find a compromise.</p> <p>\"The only reason anything ever is in that razor is because it delights guys,\" Powell says. \"There is not one thing more in there than is needed to delight them. There are no gimmicks, no funny things, it's all about performance,\" he adds, though, when pressed, he does admit \"there's a cool toy factor built into it\". </p> <p>According to Gillette's own research, two out of three men prefer the Fusion to the Mach3. \"It's what guys seek,\" Powell says. </p> <p>They give me a Fusion Power Stealth to take home - more freebie marketing; I'd never have bought one - and I have to admit it is nicer to shave with, and gives a smoother result, than my old Mach3 (I reluctantly traded up from the SensorExcel a few years ago because Sainsbury's didn't have replacement blades). The single blade on the back is particularly handy. I can't say the friction-reducing vibrations do much for me - around the mouth, they feel as if you're having your teeth scaled and polished. The electric beard-trimmer on the end of the Wilkinson Sword Quattro Titanium Precision makes more sense (or would, if I had a beard that needed trimming).</p> <p>The point of the microchip in the Power models, incidentally, is threefold: to control the electrical discharge from the battery, so vibration levels are constant across the battery's life, rather than gradually weakening as it drains; to switch the motor off after eight minutes, in the event that it has been switched on accidentally; and to control the low-battery indicator light. It also allows the researchers to \"do things in terms of learning things about the consumer,\" Powell says, hastily adding: \"In our prototypes, clearly not in the product, in our research.\" </p> <p>Both firms are unsurprisingly cagey about where that research is taking them. I ask Wilkinson Sword if they have a six-bladed successor in the pipeline. \"RD&amp;E [research, development and engineering] is working consistently on upgrading our products,\" they say, \"and is evaluating all opportunities that our technologies are offering us.\" That's a resounding \"maybe\", then.</p> <p>I was more than persuaded by both firms that the technology isn't some kind of con: the researchers I met were all gifted, dedicated people, responding with infectious enthusiasm and flair to the real technical and intellectual problems with which they were presented. So, yes, the business is about fulfilling the consumers' desire for a better shave. But it's also about creating that desire: if the two out of three men who prefer the Fusion to the Mach3 had never been offered the Fusion, they'd never have known what they were missing. Still, that's capitalism for you. If you wanted an allegorical portrait of modern western capitalist society, you could do a lot worse than a man alone at a shaving mirror, intent on his own reflection, while from the other side of the glass a vast global corporation is watching, recording and planning what to sell him next.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown yesterday sought to bring fresh purpose to his premiership and tackle the global economic crisis by bringing Peter Mandelson into the government for the third time, and unveiling an economic war cabinet of businessmen and politicians at the heart of Whitehall.</p> <p>Brown made his dramatic act of reconciliation to the arch-Blairite as a Guardian/ICM poll showed that the Conservatives had secured a post-conference fillip, boosting their lead over Labour by three points to 12 points.</p> <p>However, 55% of voters think the prime minister has handled the economic situation well, against only 39% who say he has performed badly.</p> <p>Brown hopes Mandelson's return, part of a limited but bold reshuffle, can mark a turning point in his leadership, and will be seen as confirmation of a truce between Brownites and Blairites after months of debilitating infighting. </p> <p>Other key developments in the reshuffle included:</p> <p>\u2022 establishment of a 19-strong national economic council, chaired by Brown, meeting twice weekly to coordinate government action to tackle the banking crisis;</p> <p>\u2022 creation of a Department of Energy and Climate Change under Ed Miliband; </p> <p>\u2022 moving Stephen Carter, director of strategy in Downing Street, to a ministerial role within the new economic \"war cabinet\".</p> <p>But it was Mandelson's surprise return from his job as EU trade commissioner that startled Westminster. Apart from his business brief, Mandelson will provide much-needed political strategic advice to Brown in the run-up to the next election, including trying to give him greater political definition. He will also try to tighten the Downing Street operation. </p> <p>At a press briefing, Brown admitted he had had his ups and downs with Mandelson, but said \"serious times need serious people doing serious jobs\". </p> <p>He added: \"If you have got someone with unrivalled experience in international business issues, someone who is respected by business for what he has done and who has built a reputation over these last few years as someone who can get things done, then if the British government can benefit from that, it's the right decision.\"</p> <p>Evidently astonished by the offer, Mandelson, who was only asked to return to the cabinet on Thursday, said he hoped to make it \"third time lucky\". He added that the serious economic crisis required \"all hands to the pump\". </p> <p>Although he has been a divisive figure throughout his career, cabinet ministers recognise that Mandelson's appointment may pay off. One said: \"It is a bold masterstroke politically and might even work electorally.\" </p> <p>The Conservatives condemned Mandelson's withdrawal from Europe, saying it marked a return of the architect of spin and was a sure sign of Brown's political weakness. </p> <p>Some Labour leftwingers were apoplectic. \"The vast majority of Labour MPs will think, what was Gordon Brown thinking of? He is the most divisive figure in the Labour party,\" said John McDonnell, the leftwing MP for Hayes and Harlington.</p> <p>The reshuffle also sees a restructuring of the much criticised Downing Street operation, with Carter leaving to become communications minister inside the economic war cabinet. He has become a peer. Damian McBride, Brown's tough but effective political spin doctor, steps back from five years' frontline briefing to work on strategic policy inside No 10. He will work closely with two Cabinet Office ministers, Tom Watson and Liam Byrne. </p> <p>In a move welcomed by environmentalists, Brown has also reconfigured Whitehall so that environment and energy are married into a new department headed by Ed Miliband.</p> <p>Two ministers join the cabinet for the first time: Jim Murphy is appointed Scottish secretary and Lady Royall is leader of the House of Lords. </p> <p>Nick Brown, a Brown ally, becomes chief whip, replacing Geoff Hoon, who becomes transport secretary, replacing Ruth Kelly, who is standing down from politics at the next election. John Hutton, the Blairite secretary of state for business, shifts to defence, replacing Des Browne, who is leaving the government and so also relinquishes the Scottish secretaryship, his other cabinet post. </p> <p>Browne was offered a variety of posts including a joint one of Northern Ireland and Scotland, but he insisted he wanted to leave frontline politics.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that Jon Cruddas was offered the housing post at a meeting with Brown yesterday but turned it down after he was told he could not start a big council house building programme. Downing Street denies he was offered the job.</p> <p>Mandelson's departure from his EU post has led Brown to send the leader of the Lords, Lady Ashton, to Europe at least until next November. Her appointment avoids a difficult byelection. </p> <p>At his press conference, Brown also announced the new economic council, saying that Mandelson and 18 other ministers would meet twice a week through out the current global crisis.</p> <p>Explaining the new body, Brown said: \"Quite simply, we do not need just to change policies but the way we make decisions and the way we govern.\" </p> <p>He has asked Paul Myners, chairman of the Guardian Media Group, to become City spokesman, and Margaret Beckett, the former foreign secretary, to be housing spokeswoman, on the new economic council.</p>",
  "<p>Hotels and restaurants are bearing the brunt of belt-tightening by consumers that has caused the sharpest slowdown in the service sector in more than a decade, it was revealed yesterday.</p> <p>Completing a clean sweep this week of gloomy snapshots of the economy's three big sectors, the CIPS/Markit survey showed jobs being shed in response to falling demand. Surveys of manufacturing and construction released earlier this week also pointed to recessionary conditions.</p> <p>Roy Aycliffe, director of professional practice at CIPS, said service activity, which accounts for 70% of economic output, had fallen at its fastest rate since the survey began 12 years ago. With consumer spending power affected by stagnant real incomes, rising prices and the credit crunch, hotels and restaurants were \"by far the worst hit\" part of the service sector.</p> <p>\"Lack of client confidence drove a significant reduction in new business as the global financial crisis gathered pace,\" the survey said.</p> <p>The CIPS/Markit purchasing managers' index dropped from 49.2 to 46 last month and with any reading below 50 seen as evidence that the sector is contracting, the survey boosted expectations that the Bank of England would cut interest rates next week.</p> <p>Some economists were wondering whether the bleak picture would prompt a half-point cut from 5%, rather than the usual quarter-point move.</p> <p>\"This report should help to swing a majority in favour of a rate cut at next week's monetary policy committee meeting,\" said Nick Kounis at Fortis</p> <p>The survey showed that sharp drops in new and outstanding business prompted employers to lay off more people. The employment index fell to 47.3 from 47.9.</p> <p>At the same time, inflationary pressures weakened. An index measuring firms' costs fell to 65.2, its lowest level since January, while the prices charged index was 54.5, the lowest since December.</p> <p>Paul Smith, senior economist at Markit Economics, said the data \"provided more evidence of rapidly deteriorating activity in the real economy\".</p>",

  "<p>For those who think they know Henry Moore, there are still surprises. Last year's hugely successful exhibition in Kew Gardens countered the stolid image of predictable monumentality. Kew's splendid exotic plants, glass and cast-iron palaces and cranky 18th-century chinoiserie set up a kind of dialogue of playfulness and mystery that emphasised the innate surrealism in Moore's work. The current exhibition of the artist's textiles in the gallery adjoining his home, Hoglands, at Perry Green in Hertfordshire, is equally revealing. Here is Moore, the artist who said \"I am by nature a stonecarving sculptor, I like the resistance of hard stone\", working in the realms of the flimsy and ephemeral, and in zingy cold war colours - shocking pinks, lime greens and acid yellows - too.</p> <p>Many of these textiles designs emanated from a headscarf design project. Zika Ascher, a Czech textile manufacturer who had fled the Nazis in 1939, commissioned Moore, among other well-known artists - Graham Sutherland, Picasso, Matisse, Derain - to make designs for silk or rayon women's scarves, an indispensable fashion accessory in those days for all social classes, from the princess to the mill girl. By the time the first scarves were launched in 1946, Moore had filled four textile sketchbooks with his careful annotations and a free flow of ideas.</p> <p>The sketchbooks have only recently been rediscovered, and the designs show a domestic side of Moore still largely unrecognised. One of four Moore headscarf designs Ascher put into production was Three Standing Figures, the elongated shrouded shapes of which echo the carvings of that period. But the scale and technique are different. These figures were designed to be screen-printed on to parachute nylon and worn by actual women as they walked along the street. Art in motion, art subservient to human whim. The Ascher scarves were publicised as usable, adaptable - \"designed to fold, to throw on a table, to carry crumpled in the hand\".</p> <p>There is a lightness, wit and humanism in Moore's outburst of designs for textiles in the middle of the war. Some of his sketchbook ideas for curtain fabrics, with their draped and huddled human forms, have a tendresse reminiscent of his wartime shelter drawings. He was always intrigued by the fluidity of folds. Repeat patterns based on clock faces, insect wings and safety pins, caterpillars, watering cans and piano keys: this is consciously the imagery of everyday life, postwar art for the people, dealing in shared memories. These motifs were intended both for mass production and for popular consumption. Moore's fabric featuring barbed wire was used to make the dressing gown worn by Sally Gray in the Alberto Cavalcanti movie They Made Me a Fugitive (1947). </p> <p>\"Can Painters Design Textiles?\" In an article published in 1946, the critic Nikolaus Pevsner raised the question of whether artists demeaned themselves by association with the non-unique artefact. Moore, like others of his socialist artistic generation - Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth, for example - disagreed with such an arrogant, elitist view of art. One of the delights of the current exhibition is following Moore's fabric designs beyond the gallery and into the domestic setting of the house in which he lived for more than 40 years.</p> <p>He and his wife, Irina, moved to Perry Green in 1940, during the early weeks of the blitz, having been bombed out of his Hampstead studio. Recently restored, Hoglands is now open to the public and Moore's textiles can be seen convincingly in situ. One of these is Heads, a frieze pattern based on a line of mask-like warriors, which the Moores used as curtains in the sitting room, office and kitchen. Opposite Heads in the kitchen hung Picasso's etching Sue\u00f1o y mentira de Franco (Dreams and Lies of Franco, 1937), acknowledging how indebted Moore's design was to Picasso, whom he had first met in Paris that year. A photograph in the Moore archive shows Irina sitting in an armchair stitching a rayon curtain in another of his beautiful 1940s fabrics, Horse's Head and Boomerang.</p> <p>Hoglands is a small timber-framed farmhouse in the countryside, partly medieval in origin. When the Moores first arrived, they rented only half the house. They later acquired the freehold of the whole. Gradually they bought more land around the house and built a small group of working studios. No doubt Hoglands appeared spacious in comparison with the Yorkshire miner's terrace house in Castleford in which Moore was brought up, three or four children crammed into a bedroom. But the house often struck visitors, and will no doubt still strike them, as a peculiarly modest habitat for an artist of such large-scale imaginative vision. Was this really the house of a sculptor who, by the time of his 1972 exhibition in Florence, was being solemnly compared with Michelangelo?</p> <p>In relation to other artists' houses open to the public, Hoglands lacks obvious charisma. And it isn't just the name, with its Monty Python overtones. In comparison with Red House at Bexleyheath, a romantic flowing building designed by Philip Webb for William Morris and described by a contemporary as \"more of a poem than a house\", the Moores' Hertfordshire home appears constricted and prosaic. Alongside the generosity of surface decoration and brilliant spurts of colour at Charleston in Sussex, the home of Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, Hoglands looks subdued. With its Scandinavian modern furniture and striped tweed curtains, the formal yellow sitting room at Hoglands, built as an extension in 1960, seems more like that of a successful country doctor or solicitor than Britain's best-known contemporary sculptor. </p> <p>You need to look quite closely to see the point of Hoglands, such a poignant illustration of Roger Fry's proposal: \"What if people were just to let their houses be the direct outcome of their actual needs, and of their actual way of life, and allow other people to think what they like.\" As a young man, Moore was greatly influenced by Fry, whose Omega Workshops produced a range of artists' textiles that were in many ways the forerunners of Moore's. The fascination of Hoglands is this muted quality, the sense of inner rhythms, of the \"actual way of life\" the family evolved there as the background to Moore's prodigious productivity. </p> <p>When Walter Gropius designed his ideal Masters' Houses for the artists of the Bauhaus - Moholy-Nagy, Feininger, Kandinsky, Klee - these were semi-detached houses with atelier included. Moore would have found this way of life a nightmare. To make art, he needed a departure from the house to the sculpture workshop or the maquette studio, his own creative domain where, as he once described it, he experienced utter serenity, the happiness of being \"fully engaged\". But he needed the house as the place of coming back to, for morning elevenses, four o'clock tea, a whisky in the evening before Hancock's Half-Hour or The Brains Trust on the black-and-white TV. Of course, Moore travelled - to America, to Greece, to Forte dei Marmi, where he had a summer house near the Carrara marble quarries. But when he returned to Hoglands, the even tenor of domestic routine was immutable.</p> <p>When the Tate took over Barbara Hepworth's Trewyn Studio in 1980, five years after her death, the living spaces were turned into a gallery. They kept the art but expunged the traces of her admirable terse, committed personality. This was surely a mistake. The only point of conserving an artist's house is to show how that artist lived in it and used it, bringing out the subtle interplay of art and daily life.</p> <p>At Hoglands, these connections and relationships are tangible. Alongside creating such monumental carvings as Family Group for Harlow New Town, Moore was constantly responding to domestic events, his own family minutiae, recorded in his sketchbooks. Mother and child images and tiny heads of babies proliferated after the birth of the Moores' only child, Mary, in 1946. Later, he made drawings of the schoolgirl doing homework. He drew his sister knitting. There are numerous portraits of the family dog Fawkes. It is striking how the public and private interact. </p> <p>In a recent book on Hoglands edited by David Mitchinson, Andrew Causey makes the point that Moore's identity was \"connected with the place, the ground under his feet, the flints, bones and driftwood that inspired him and which he kept lining his studio walls\". These objets trouv\u00e9s entered the house too, arranged to make a crowded still life on the coffee table in the yellow sitting room, juxtaposed with the Dubonnet bottle, soda syphon, ancient carvings, small-scale modern sculptures, including Moore's own alabaster Head of 1923. Visiting children were encouraged to examine the gnarled bones and stones with holes, and quizzed on which were the accidents of nature and which the Henry Moores. </p> <p>The sense of nature close around Moore was essential. Near the house there were the fruit trees and garden planted by Irina, a great lover of bright colours, with peonies, brilliant red tulips and geraniums, deep blue gentians. It was after moving to Hoglands, from the shelter drawings onwards, that colour became more important to Moore's work, burgeoning in the postwar textiles he designed for David Whitehead, as well as Ascher, and the figurative wall panels printed on to linen or woven cotton. These large-scale panels, some of which are on show in the current exhibition, make one sorry the artist had not been more involved with stage design.</p> <p>Eventually Moore owned 70 acres of Hertfordshire. Sheep grazed in fields around him. They became a fascination. He watched them from the window, stalked them through the grass. He came to love them and described how he \"began to think also about their immensely strong biblical associations\". As he observed them, the sheep that had at first seemed merely big balls of wool with a head and four legs took a precise form, so that in the end he could identify individual animals - the ones he had already drawn, and those that still awaited him.</p> <p>The sheep in turn adopted a Moore sculpture, the large two-part bronze known as Sheep Piece (still at Hoglands), nibbling at the grass around it, sheltering beneath it. Sheep were the right scale, he felt, beside his sculpture. A horse would be all wrong. Moore came to feel so easy in his close relationship with his environment that he was able to reshape it, constructing the low grassy hillock now surmounted by his Large Reclining Figure (1984), outlined so dramatically against the sky.</p> <p>Moore died in 1986, Irina three years later. Through the 1990s, Hoglands lay neglected and deteriorating. This was a decade of acrimonious dispute over ownership of works between the Moore family and the Henry Moore Foundation, eventually taken to the Court of Appeal in 1996. Hoglands was bought from the family by the foundation in 2004, and its subsequent careful restoration can be seen as an act of reconciliation.</p> <p>Many of the works of art Moore and his wife collected have now returned to the house. In the large yellow sitting room, for example, there is the Romanesque marble carving of a mourning angel attributed to Tino di Camaino, the great wooden Luba mask from the Congo, Courbet's La Grotte de la Loue; in the smaller sitting room, a maternal scene by Eug\u00e8ne Carri\u00e8re. It is this sense of artistic continuity, Moore's generosity of spirit in acknowledging the work of other artists, that gives the house its particular luminosity.</p> <p>The French have a stronger tradition than the British of restoring artists' houses. This country has tended to do better by its writers. The closest parallel to Hoglands I know is the house at Giverny, near Vernon, where Monet decided to settle in 1883. The pale salmon-pink house with its sage-green doors and shutters. The fields, the trees, the river Seine, those water-lily pools.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780297854586\">Firmin</a><br>by Sam Savage <br>184pp, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, \u00a310.99</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780224085199\">The Wolf</a><br>by Joseph Smith<br>154pp, Jonathan Cape, \u00a310</p> <p>Talking animals are common in children's literature, but not many adult novels feature such narrators as Firmin and The Wolf: a well-read rat who fantasises about Ginger Rogers and a mind-reading wolf. Both books are short, illustrated first novels, but their content could hardly be more different. One is a rambling fantasy packed with jokes, jibes and digressions; the other is a sharply focused attempt to get inside an animal's head. </p> <p>Born in the basement of a Boston bookshop, Firmin is the 13th child of a rat with only 12 nipples. Left to fend for himself, he chomps on his bedding, a copy of \"the Great Book\", \"the history of the world in four parts\". Finnegans Wake is often dismissed as unreadable, but it has a miraculous effect on Firmin: suddenly, he can read. </p> <p>At first, Firmin eats and reads without any discernment - \"a mouthful of Faulkner was a mouthful of Flaubert as far as I was concerned\" - but his tastebuds grow so refined that they can distinguish the literary quality of a book. He tastes food in a bookish way too; when he has the bad luck to nibble some rat poison, he discovers that the pellets are \"oddly delicious, tasting like a blend of Velveeta cheese, hot asphalt and Proust\". </p> <p>Books define Firmin's life, expand his imagination, infest his dreams and cut him off from his fellow rats, who do not share his literary enthusiasms. \"Thanks to their dwarfish imaginations and short memories they did not ask for a lot, mostly just food and fornication, and they got enough of both to take them through life.\" </p> <p>Firmin is bursting to express himself, but he cannot speak, write or operate a typewriter. He may have swallowed millions of words, but he has no way to regurgitate them. Sam Savage has written a wonderful celebration of the way reading enriches your life. Firmin may be a rat - poisoned by people he thinks are his friends - but his imagination soars as high as that of any human.</p> <p>If Firmin has a literary antecedent, it is probably Reepicheep, the swash-buckling rodent from Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The ancestors of Joseph Smith's wolf are more conventional: Tarka, Buck from The Call of the Wild and, particularly, Black Beauty, who similarly is the narrator of his autobiography. </p> <p>The Wolf is an austere novella, following an old wolf at the end of a long winter as he searches for food. \"I have never been this hungry or this weakened and while there is plenty of strength within me I know from somewhere deep inside that I must eat soon, and well. If I don't I will change - I will change to something less than what I should be, a change that might be impossible to alter.\" </p> <p>The wolf pads through the forest, meeting a deer, a man, a hare, a crow, a fox and a swan, hunting or being hunted. With great sensitivity, Smith describes the bracing immediacy of an animal's responses to its body, its environment and other creatures.</p> <p>Like Firmin, the wolf is a very human animal. He detests weakness; he admires cunning; he feels hope, pride, disgust, shame and anger; he provides exceptionally eloquent descriptions of his interior world. He cannot talk, but he can project himself into the minds and memories of his fellow creatures. He is an intriguing narrator, brought to life in lean, elegant and rather beautiful prose. The Wolf is an accomplished, impressive little book which reads more like a talented young writer's calling card than a fully realised novel; it will be fascinating to see what Smith writes next. </p> <p>\u2022 Josh Lacey's Bearkeeper is published by Scholastic.</p>",
  "<p>The credit crunch has had a severe impact on transatlantic business travel, British Airways admitted yesterday, as it reported an 8.6% slump in premium traffic.</p> <p>Nine out of BA's top 20 corporate customers are banks and the carrier said \"increased anxiety\" in global stockmarkets was affecting bookings. Passenger numbers in September fell 5.6% on the same month last year as the airline carried 165,000 fewer customers, with business passengers down 8.6%.</p> <p>\"Trading conditions continue to be challenging. Long-haul premium traffic has softened after the summer and forward bookings are being affected by the increased anxiety in financial markets,\" BA said. Economy class bookings fell 4.1% but analysts are expected to focus on business class bookings, which account for the majority of BA profits.</p> <p>BA maintained its target of breaking even for the financial year, but the statement confirmed analysts' fears that a recent fall in fuel costs will be offset by a decline in bookings due to the economic downturn. Industry insiders have warned that market turmoil over the past week has in effect shut down all bank bookings.</p> <p>BA said it was continuing with \"cost initiatives\" to ease the revenue loss. About 1,400 BA managers received letters this week offering voluntary redundancies as Willie Walsh, BA's chief executive, tries to remove an entire layer of management. </p> <p>Walsh has described the combination of high fuel costs and dwindling sales as the \"worst ever\" crisis to hit the industry. The International Air Transport Association has forecast that the sector will lose more than \u00a35bn over 2008 and 2009, with scores of airlines also expected to go bankrupt. </p> <p>Ryanair, in contrast, yesterday reported \"no slowdown\" in its September bookings, though it said the number of seats sold per flight had dipped slightly.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday October 7 2008. This article about British Airways said that nine out of its top 10 corporate customers were banks. That should have been nine out of its top 20 corporate customers. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Carmakers are pushing the European commission for a \u20ac40bn (\u00a332bn) \"green\" bail-out plan to help them meet stringent EU limits on carbon emissions, it emerged yesterday.</p> <p>Sergio Marchionne, Fiat's chief executive, said in Paris that the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) would approach the commission for a loan. The US Congress last weekend approved a $25bn loan to the American motor industry, which is struggling to compete with smaller, \"green\" cars imported from Asia, to help it modernise plants and produce environmentally friendly cars.</p> <p>The ACEA approach, said to have been approved unanimously by its 15 members, comes at a politically highly charged moment over the car industry's contribution to fighting climate change.</p> <p>Last week the European parliament's environment committee overturned the views of MEPs on the industry committee and voted for a 17% reduction in car emissions by 2012.</p>",
  "<p>A furious bust-up broke out between several of America's biggest high-street banks yesterday as Citigroup threatened to sue its west coast rival Wells Fargo for muscling in on an agreed takeover of the struggling financial services group Wachovia.</p> <p>Citigroup executives woke up to the news that their government-backed $2.16bn (\u00a31.2bn) buyout of Wachovia's retail banking network had been trumped by Wells Fargo paying $15bn for all Wachovia's businesses.</p> <p>The new deal, which requires no support from taxpayers, includes Wachovia's high-street operations and its asset management and brokerage arms. It puts Wachovia at the centre of an unlikely tug-of-war between two potential saviours. The North Carolina-based firm has been struggling to stay afloat because of its vast exposure to sub-prime mortgages.</p> <p>Wachovia's chief executive, Robert Steel, said he had \"great admiration and respect\" for Wells Fargo: \"We are extremely pleased to join forces with this outstanding company.\"</p> <p>Steel said the new arrangement would keep Wachovia intact, avoiding the disruption of breaking up the bank.</p> <p>But the bid came as a complete surprise to Citigroup, which has been providing liquidity support to Wachovia since agreeing on the principles of a deal to buy the struggling bank's 4,800-strong retail chain on Monday, a tie-up aided by a guarantee from the federal deposit insurance corporation.</p> <p>Citigroup said it had an exclusivity agreement with Wachovia and that Wells Fargo's involvement constituted \"tortious interference\"- meaning that it was legally damaging.</p> <p>Citigroup complained it had negotiated in good faith and had almost completed a definitive deal. It said: \"Citi has demanded that Wachovia and Wells Fargo terminate any proposed transaction, any conduct in furtherance thereof, or any other act in violation of the exclusivity agreement.\"</p> <p>The row means that in a matter of days, Wachovia has gone from an unloved institution with a bombed-out share price and a dubious balance sheet to hot property for two of America's best-known names in financial services.</p> <p>Banking shares surged as investors enjoyed a fresh burst of confidence that the industry was capable of absorbing its own stragglers without aid from the public purse. Wachovia's stock leapt $2.67 to $6.58 and bankrupt Washington Mutual jumped 12% on hopes that its rescue by JP Morgan could be similarly trumped. But Citigroup's stock slumped by nearly 10%. The debacle is a blow for Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram Pandit, who saw an acquisition of Wachovia as an opportunity to make his mark by creating America's biggest network of high-street branches, a move towards his goal of a \"global universal\" bank. Citigroup had planned to raise $10bn to finance the deal.</p> <p>\"Citigroup loses an attractive, accretive deal,\" said David Trone, a banking analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton, in a research note. \"One silver lining is that Citi can refocus on its own operational problems.\"</p> <p>For regulators, the involvement of Wells Fargo is likely to be a relief as it gets a potential liability off the books of the FDIC which has already seen its funds stretched by the failure of 14 regional banks in the US this year. </p> <p>Under the original buyout, Citigroup was to accept the first $30bn of losses from Wachovia's $312bn of mortgage assets </p> <p>with the FDIC swallowing further defaults. In a carefully worded statement, the FDIC's chairman, Sheila Bair, said her authority \"stands behind\" its deal with Citigroup but added that it would be working with other regulators to \"pursue a resolution that serves the public interest\".</p> <p>For Wells Fargo, a takeover builds on its strength on the west coast of the US by adding Wachovia's heartland of the south-east. Between them, the two banks have $1.42 trillion in assets, 280,000 staff, 10,700 branches and $787bn in deposits.</p> <p>Wells Fargo's chairman, Dick Kovacevich said: \"It makes compelling business and strategic sense and is simply an incredible fit.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Based in <strong>San Francisco</strong>, <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> is a result of an acquisition of Wells Fargo &amp; Co by Minneapolis-based <strong>Norwest Corporation</strong> in 1998. The banking group began in the <strong>1850s</strong> as a network of horse-drawn stagecoaches carrying passengers, mail and gold across the American west. In the latter years of the 19th century, its operations increasingly shifted to newly completed railways, shuttling funds from <strong>California</strong> to the financial centres of Chicago and New York. Since the <strong>1960s</strong>, Wells Fargo has expanded from a <strong>regional bank </strong>to become a coast-to-coast player with <strong>5,941 branches</strong> and 160,000 staff. At the height of the credit crunch, it is the only US bank with a <strong>triple-A</strong> credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>",
  "<p>We are winning in Iraq, John McCain declared in the presidential debate last week, \"and we will come home with victory and with honour.\" This may sound like some perfunctory keep-the-pecker-up stuff from a former military man. But the Republican candidate, who believes that the \"surge\" has succeeded in Iraq, also possesses the fanatical conviction that heavier bombing and more ground troops could have saved the United States from disgrace in Vietnam. </p> <p>On the same occasion, Barack Obama, who seems more aware of the costs of American honour to the American economy, claimed he would divert troops from Iraq to Afghanistan and, if necessary, order them to assault \"safe havens\" for terrorists in Pakistan's wild west. Both candidates sought the imprimatur of Henry Kissinger, the co-alchemist, with Richard Nixon, of the \"peace with honour\" formula in Vietnam, which turned out to include the destruction of neighbouring Cambodia. </p> <p>An ominously similar escalation of the \"war on terror\" has ensured that the next American president will receive a septic chalice from George Bush in January 2009. In July, Bush sanctioned raids into Pakistan, pre-empting Obama's tough-sounding strategy of widening the war in Afghanistan, where resurgent Taliban this year account for Nato's highest death toll since 2001. Pakistan's army chief vowed to defend his country \"at all costs\", and his soldiers now clash with US troops almost daily. Obscured by the American economy's slow-motion train wreck, the war on terror has already stumbled into its most treacherous phase with the invasion of fiercely nationalistic and nuclear-armed Pakistan. </p> <p>Most of the recent disasters of geopolitical machismo could have been foretold. In late 2003, when the occupation of Iraq was beginning to go badly wrong, the American journalist Dexter Filkins came across a village called Abu Hishma in the Sunni triangle. Rubble-strewn and \"encased in razor wire\", Abu Hishma resembled, Filkins writes in The Forever War: Dispatches from the War on Terror (Bodley Head), \"a town in the West Bank\". Its terrified residents told him about the local American commander Nathan Sassaman, who bulldozed homes and called in air strikes, and who was fond of proclaiming that \"there is no God - I am god here\". </p> <p>Sassaman sounds like something out of Conrad, the white man in the tropics driven to lunacy by absolute power and extreme isolation. But, according to Filkins, he is a bright man, even the \"embodiment of the best that America could offer\" in his desire to bring democracy to Iraqis. A serious reader of history and anthropology, Sassaman, along with fellow officers, is very impressed by a book entitled The Arab Mind, by Raphael Patai, a Hungarian-Israeli-American academic. Apparently, it makes clear that the \"only thing\" the denizens of the Middle East \"understand is force - force, pride and saving face\", and Sassaman believes that, \"with a heavy dose of fear and violence, and a lot of money for projects ... we can convince these people that we are here to help them\".</p> <p>Filkins doesn't mention that The Arab Mind, originally published in 1973, was the bible of neocon commentators in Washington and New York cheerleading the Bush administration's audacious venture: what Condoleezza Rice in the new book by Bob Woodward, The War Within: A Secret White House History 2006-2008 (Simon &amp; Schuster), describes as shifting the \"epicentre of American power\" from Europe, where it had rested since the second world war, to the Middle East. Widely read in the US military, The Arab Mind later inspired the modus operandi of the jailers of Abu Ghraib. </p> <p>More surprisingly, respectable intellectuals, journalists and academics echoed its generalisations. Among these people was the historian Bernard Lewis, who assured Dick Cheney, one of his most devoted readers, that \"in that part of the world, nothing matters more than resolute will and force\". The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman (who is on Sassaman's reading list) exhorted the US to act \"just a little bit crazy\", since \"the more frightened our enemies are today, the fewer we will have to fight tomorrow\". Accordingly, Richard Armitage, assistant secretary of state and a relative moderate among the Bush administration's hawks, told Pakistani diplomats that the US would bomb their country \"back to the stone age\" if it did not withdraw its support for the Taliban. </p> <p>The idea that the natives would recognise superior firepower when they saw it seemed to be validated by Pakistani acquiescence, followed by the Taliban's swift capitulation. Iraq was logically the next setting for shock-and-awe tactics - Donald Rumsfeld was complaining even before the aerial bombing of the Taliban had finished that Afghanistan had run out of targets. The Bush administration claimed that Saddam Hussein had to be disarmed to make the Middle East safe for democracy. But invading Iraq was also an image-making exercise - what Hannah Arendt, commenting on the absence of clear military goals in America's previous war of choice in Vietnam, described as the attempt by \"a superpower to create for itself an image which would convince the world that it was indeed 'the mightiest power on earth'\".</p> <p>Busy unleashing his awesome firepower on Iraq, Rumsfeld had no idea what to do after his streamlined army reached Baghdad, apart from letting stuff happen. Wiser in Battle, the memoir of the US lieutenant general Ricardo Sanchez (HarperCollins), reveals that, as the Iraqi resistance unexpectedly intensified, the defeat in Vietnam began to prey on Bush's mind, unravelling his syntax as he harangued his commanders in Iraq:</p> <p>Kick ass! ... We must be tougher than hell! This Vietnam stuff, this is not even close. It is a mind-set. We can't send that message. It's an excuse to prepare us for withdrawal ... There is a series of moments and this is one of them. Our will is being tested, but we are resolute. We have a better way. Stay strong! Stay the course! Kill them! Be confident! Prevail! We are going to wipe them out! We are not blinking!</p> <p>Thomas Ricks, the Washington Post's Pentagon correspondent, describes in his book Fiasco (Penguin) how, after a mob ambushed and killed four American military contractors in Falluja, the commanders were ordered to \"go in and clobber\". Citing strategic and logistical reasons, the military chiefs pleaded for restraint, but they were overruled by the White House: the destruction of Falluja was as essential to the image-making exercise as the carpet-bombing of Vietnam and Cambodia. </p> <p>The geopolitical consequences as well as the \"collateral\" damage of the exhibition of US might are succinctly outlined by the titles of recent books - The Forever War, Fiasco and Ahmed Rashid's Descent into Chaos (Allen Lane). Rashid is clearly the most despairing among the journalists accompanying the march of folly, even though, as a Pakistani long accustomed to the pretensions and limits of US power in south Asia, he didn't start off with many illusions. His previous book described how a combination of selfish motives and reckless actions by the US facilitated the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistan and Afghanistan. \"Outsiders like me,\" he writes in Descent into Chaos, \"found it remarkable that a US president could live in such an unreal world, where the entire military and intelligence establishments were so gullible, the media so complacent, Congress so unquestioning - all of them involved in feeding half-truths to the American public.\"</p> <p>The habitual deceivers are often, in the end, the most deceived. According to Rashid, Pervez Musharraf's regime in Pakistan may have pulled off one of the biggest swindles in recent history by persuading the Bush administration to part with $10bn in exchange for mostly empty promises of support for its \"war on terror\". Most Pakistanis feel a mix of contempt and distrust for the US, which abandoned their country after enlisting it in a proxy war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Confronted with a choice between regressing to the stone age and meeting crazy Uncle Sam's demands, Musharraf's regime adopted a policy of dissembling that the then foreign minister outlined as \"First say yes, and later say but\". Since 9/11, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan's rogue spy agency, which has long considered Afghanistan as its backyard, has continued to provide sanctuary and military support for the Taliban while occasionally arresting some al-Qaida militants to appease Washington. Mullah Omar and the original Afghan Taliban Shura, Rashid claims, are serenely resident in Pakistan's borderlands, along with \"a plethora of Asian and Arab terrorist groups who are now expanding their reach into Europe and the United States\". </p> <p>\"I'm not,\" Bush said soon after 9/11, \"going to fire a $2m missile at a $10 empty tent and hit a camel in the butt.\" Hitting camels in the butt may have been more useful than disbursing $70m in bribes to warlords such as Abdul Rashid Dostum, whom Rashid revealed in his previous book to be fond of driving tanks over his opponents. The US coaxed many of Afghanistan's old villains out of retirement to defeat the Taliban with minimum use of US troops, and then lost interest in the country.</p> <p>Rashid believes that the US could have done more to help \"nation-building\" in Afghanistan or at least prop up Hamid Karzai, who last week was reduced to plaintively asking Mullah Omar to return to Afghanistan for the sake of \"peace\". But as Tariq Ali bluntly clarifies in his new book The Duel: Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power (Simon &amp; Schuster), the post-9/11 project of \"nation-building\" in Afghanistan, which prioritised western interests over all others, was always doomed. It was \"a top-down process\", trying to create \"an army constituted not to defend the nation but to impose order on its own people, on behalf of outside powers; a civil administration that will have no control over planning, health, education etc, all of which will be run by NGOs, whose employees will be far better paid than the locals, and answerable not to the population but to their overseas sponsors; and a government whose foreign policy is identical to Washington's.\"</p> <p>American bombing raids, which have killed hundreds of civilians in Afghanistan, further unite fractious Afghans against foreign usurpers. Tariq Ali correctly prescribes scepticism against strategists and journalists who blame Pakistan for increasing attacks on western forces in Afghanistan while disregarding the fact that \"many Afghans who detest the Taliban are so angered by the failures of Nato and the behaviour of its troops that they will support any opposition.\"</p> <p>In Pakistan, too, public anger against the US is fuelled largely by the \"knowledge that Washington has backed every military dictator who has squatted on top of the country\". Contemptuously dismissing the alarmist clich\u00e9 that jihadis are very close to getting their grubby fingers on the country's nuclear button, Ali points to the deep and persistent unpopularity of religious parties in Pakistan. The jihadis would only get that far, he asserts, if \"the army wanted them to\", which is virtually impossible unless, as may be beginning to happen now, American assaults on the country's hard-won sovereignty causes deep ideological ruptures within the country's strongest institution.</p> <p>Filkins doesn't set out any future trajectory for the venture in Iraq. He reported from the country for the New York Times, but the first-person narrator of The Forever War is less a journalist than an existential hero, eloquent with the pathos of Sisyphean striving, impotence and failure. Composed in short, often lyrical, sections, Filkins's book often seems aimed at literary posterity, where it would join such modern classics of war literature as Ernst Junger's Storm of Steel, Andr\u00e9 Malraux's La Condition Humaine and Michael Herr's Dispatches</p> <p>Unlike the war in Vietnam, which exercised some of the keenest literary sensibilities in America (Norman Mailer, Mary McCarthy, Susan Sontag), the entanglement in Iraq and Afghanistan has produced, so far at least, a meagre crop of quality journalism. The Forever War, which generally eschews historical overviews and extended analysis, succeeds more than most recent books in making cinematically vivid and imaginatively coherent the many places of horror and bewilderment that Americans have stumbled into during the \"war on terror\". This is what it is like - its brief confessions of doubt, confusion, panic and weariness seem to say - for an American young man witnessing the terrible violence of places such as Iraq and Afghanistan. </p> <p>Filkins has the exasperation of the well-travelled and atrocity-hardened journalist with his sheltered compatriots back home. The attack on the twin towers in New York makes him think that \"I was back in the third world ... My countrymen are going to think this is the end of the world, the worst thing that ever happened. In the third world this sort of thing happens every day.\" After the cyclone in Orissa, Filkins writes, \"the dead were piled so high and for so long that the dogs couldn't eat any more\". But as he strives to share with us the cruelty and tragedy of the world outside the west, he inadvertently reveals his historical innocence as well as hinting at a wider incomprehension of the postcolonial world and the decolonised mind. </p> <p>\"Do Americans imagine,\" Jonathan Schell once wrote, \"that the people of the world, having overthrown the territorial empires, are ready to bend the knee to an American overlord in the 21st?\" Even at his most tormented, Filkins doesn't really ask this crucial question, though he cannot help but be aware of the Iraqi people's eagerness to see the back of their \"liberators\" - to \"tell the Americans what they want to hear and they will go away, and we can carry on the way we want\". In a brilliantly paced account of Falluja, Filkins describes Iraqi children recoiling from American candy as if it were \"radioactive\" and remarks that the city \"was like that from the start, even before the big battle in November 2004. Anything the Americans tried there turned to dust.\" This may convey well to an American audience the frustration of their do-gooding representatives in Iraq who alternate bombs with candy. But Filkins would have advanced a greater appreciation of national or tribal feeling in Iraq if he had explained that residents of Falluja were equally intransigent in 1920, when the British imperial army had to destroy the city in order to save it. </p> <p>As perplexed as the British once were about Iraq (\"so complex, its ways so labyrinthine\"), Filkins writes with obvious fascination about Ahmed Chalabi, the Iraqi expatriate who managed to deceive some of the shrewdest politicians and journalists in America. In many ways, Chalabi, a chronic conspirator with mysterious allies in Iran, vindicates John Quincy Adams's warning to his young nation in 1821 against European-style imperialist adventures: by going \"abroad\", Adams wrote, \"in search of monsters to destroy\", America would \"involve herself beyond the power of extraction in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy and ambition\". But Chalabi, for Filkins, embodies Iraq's vexations rather than American blundering. \"When I looked,\" he writes, \"into Chalabi's eyes and saw the mirrors and doors closing, I knew that I was seeing not just the essence of the man but of the country to which he'd returned. L'etat c'est lui. Chalabi was Iraq.\" </p> <p>Whatever may be said about this amiable fraud, he was certainly not Iraq - the country he had barely set foot in for more than 40 years before the US invasion. Though easily the most original and intense American book yet on the war in Iraq, The Forever War is far from matching the stupendous achievement of Neil Sheehan's A Bright Shining Lie, which expresses more resonantly the American reporter's angst while ruthlessly investigating specific national flaws - racism, cold war paranoia, belief in technology - that entrapped the US in Vietnam. By abandoning the tasks of analysis and introspection, Filkins's book makes us suspect that the \"forever war\" might make a new generation of can-do Americans weary, but not wiser. </p> <p>\"I'd gotten caught up,\" he writes at one point, \"in the trappings and the pronouncements of officialdom, Iraqi and American.\" It is an admirably honest confession, but not one that the best US journalists covering their country's last big war would have made. Arriving in Vietnam in the early 1960s to report what was then a covert US operation, Homer Bigart, David Halberstam, Charley Mohr and Sheehan spent only a few weeks in the fog of official bluster. Their boldness was especially remarkable because the US media in the 1950s had largely shared a consensus about the dangers of communism with the White House and State Department, which regarded even newspapers such as the New York Times as extensions of foreign policy. </p> <p>Ignoring the adversarial standard set by Halberstam and Sheehan, many US journalists and commentators in the post-cold-war era have been too eager to uphold their government's claims. It is not clear if Filkins was one of the liberal interventionists with a naive faith in the Bush administration's promise to promote democracy through war. Certainly his frequent laments about the inept handling of the invasion and occupation of Iraq do not lead him to conclude that an intrinsically bad idea could have been handled much differently. He can also permit himself the belief that \"perhaps in the hideous present some larger good was being born\".</p> <p>This has the unfortunate echo of Condoleezza Rice's assertion, as Israel devastated Lebanon in 2006, that we were witnessing the \"birth pangs of a new Middle East\": that is, the Lebanese, bombed into a revolt against Hizbullah, would make their country safe for pro-Israeli and pro-American democracy. Totalitarian regimes and terrorist groups commonly use violence as a means to large-scale political engineering; it is more remarkable when democratic countries such as Israel and America do so, usually in flagrant disregard of the lessons of contemporary history. In A Choice of Enemies: America Confronts the Middle East (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson), Lawrence Freedman describes in detail the awful results - the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees, the rise of Hizbullah - of Israel's previous attempt in 1982 to redraw the map of the Middle East by assaulting Lebanon. </p> <p>It is one thing for a small country with a perennial existential crisis to believe that, as the Israeli general Moshe Dayan once put it, \"it was in our power to set a high price on our blood, a price too high for the Arab community, the Arab army or the Arab governments to think it worth paying\". But how did the US let its foreign policy become hostage to a strategy of pre-emptive war and brutal retaliation? \"How,\" Freedman asks, \"had the United States gotten itself in this position, entangled in the confusing and often violent geopolitics of the Middle East and beset by enemies on all sides.\"</p> <p>This is a bigger story than anyone can tell in one book, and the 600 pages of A Choice of Enemies cover only US foreign policy decisions from 1979, with the Islamic revolution in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Freedman is forced to skim some important details of the relationship between the US and Israel, whose continuing expansion into the occupied West Bank is probably the greatest source of the so-called Arab rage. The State Department in 1948 argued passionately against supporting a Jewish state in Palestine. The Eisenhower administration, which saw Israel as an irritant, undermining the US alliance with anti-Soviet regimes in the Middle East, ensured that the joint Anglo-French-Israeli attack on Egypt would fail. John F Kennedy sent feelers to Egypt's fiercely anti-Zionist president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Lyndon B Johnson was the first US president to manipulate foreign policy in order to bolster Jewish-American support for the Democratic party; but even he was not able to build his \"special relationship\" with Israel without encountering strong opposition from American diplomats. </p> <p>\"I could not believe what I was hearing,\" Jimmy Carter wrote in his diary after Menachem Begin confided in him his desire to reduce Palestinians on the West Bank to a minority. Even Ronald Reagan, who believed that God fixed the Middle East as the site of Armageddon, stuck to a cold war policy of close relations with reliably anti-Soviet and oil-rich Arab regimes. Friendly to Saudi Arabia, Bush Sr was actively hostile to Israeli expansionism. His secretary of state, James Baker, had only blunt wisdom (\"Forswear annexation. Stop settlement activity. Reach out to Palestinians as neighbours who deserve political rights\") to impart to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the powerful lobbying outfit for Israel, to which even Obama must now genuflect.</p> <p>Israel played a very small role in the blunders US administrations made in the late 1970s: to support the Shah of Iran long after his rule became widely despised and unsustainable, and, more fatefully, to mobilise a global Islamic jihad against Soviet communism. Trying to turn Afghanistan, as Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, exulted, into the \"Soviet Union's own Vietnam\", the CIA chose Pakistan as a logistical base for its anti-communist jihad. It funnelled money and arms to the ISI, which in turn passed on some of them to its own Islamist prot\u00e9g\u00e9s (some of whom are now fighting US and Nato troops in Afghanistan). Radicals from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria and other Arab countries flocked to Pakistan to contribute to the holy war against atheistic communism. Freedman's statistics are a grim reminder of how the blowback from this first global jihad wrecked Pakistan long before it crashed into the west on September 11 2001. Pakistan, which had 900 religious schools in 1971, had \"about 8,000 official and as many as 25,000 unregistered madrassas\" by 1988. </p> <p>But if US officials noticed their indirect sponsorship of radical Islam, they did not care. As Freedman writes, \"the Reagan administration associated terrorism with leftist, secular groups linked to nationalist movements, whether the Irish, Basques or Palestinians ... Arab militants coming to support the jihad were seen at most as the equivalent of the idealists of the 1930s who joined the International Brigades during the Spanish civil war.\" </p> <p>Freedman recalls, too, some of the other political machinations that have come to haunt present generations: US support for Iraq in the latter's long war against Iran, which emboldened Saddam Hussein all through the 1980s, and the deliberate indifference to the victims of Iraq's chemical warfare. At least in these and other cynical moves, the US could claim the sanction of realpolitik. Great powers often have to make unpleasant choices to protect their interests; they have also been known occasionally to thrash (Reagan in Grenada, Putin in Georgia) a pesky neighbour or two. What is startlingly new is the Bush administration's experiment of intimidating entire peoples as well as governments in the Middle East into accepting America's worldwide hegemony. </p> <p>Seven years on, hundreds of thousands are dead, and millions of refugees on the move, while the US seems only to have boosted its old enemies in Afghanistan, Iran and Lebanon, and created formidable new ones in Iraq and Pakistan. In The War Within, Woodward shows the US president slipping deeper into his own world. \"We're killin' 'em! We're killin' 'em all!\" But not even the Bush administration, which has proved ready to do unspeakable things to its perceived enemies, can kill them all. It can continue to stage elaborate shock-and-awe spectacles, but if, as is increasingly evident, the target audience refuses to be impressed by them, they are rendered utterly futile - even dangerously counterproductive. \"Force,\" as James Baldwin pointed out in the early 1970s during the US bombing of Indochina, \"does not work the way its advocates seem to think it does. It does not, for instance, reveal to the victim the strength of his adversary. On the contrary, it reveals the weakness, even the panic of his adversary and this revelation invests the victim with patience.\"</p> <p>Apparently routed by heavy B-52 bombing in 2001, the Taliban are resurgent, straining the military resources of the US and Nato in Afghanistan to the limit. In Iraq the strategy based on overwhelming force has proved to be a catastrophic failure, and had to be replaced by General David Petraeus's new counter-insurgency doctrine that emphasises political over military tactics. Nevertheless, McCain pledges \"victory\" in Iraq, whatever that takes, including a 100-year-long military presence in the country; threatening Russia, he also seems ready to bomb Iran. Obama, though keen to withdraw troops from Iraq, upholds the complacently bipartisan consensus about Afghanistan. But more US troops in the Pashtun heartland may merely underscore the lesson learned at a terrible cost by the British army in 1839-42 and 1878-80, and the Soviet army in 1979-89. \"A troop increase,\" Rory Stewart recently reiterated in Time magazine, \"is likely to inflame Afghan nationalism because Afghans are more anti-foreign than we acknowledge, and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining.\" The violation of Pakistan's sovereignty threatens to be the most calamitous of recent US misadventures. </p> <p>A gracious acceptance of the limits of US firepower may not be forthcoming from the next administration, which will face the hard choice to get out or fight on. Indeed, failure may make it even more determined to maintain the pride of US arms and the image of the mightiest power on earth. The prospect of humiliation in Vietnam was what prompted Nixon's devastation of Cambodia, setting the stage for the genocidal Pol Pot. As Hannah Arendt wrote, \"when all signs pointed to defeat\", the goal was \"no longer one of avoiding humiliating defeat but of finding ways and means to avoid admitting it and 'save face'.\" </p> <p>Could smashing up Iran or invading Pakistan become the face-saving formula for the exponents of \"shock and awe\"? Certainly, they see US force impressing the Persian and the Pakistani mind as it apparently has the Arab mind. And such is the crazy logic of a wounded militarism that, notwithstanding its battered economy, the US may soon be embattled on many more fronts in what is already its most damaging war.</p>",
  "<p>The US government is cutting its funding for the supply of contraceptives to family planning clinics run by Marie Stopes International in Africa, alleging that it condones forced abortions in China.</p> <p>MSI has categorically denied that it supports forced abortions or coercive sterilisation in China or anywhere else in the world, and says that the actions of the Bush government will result in more abortions in Africa, as women will be unable to get contraceptives and will end up with unwanted pregnancies.</p> <p>One of George Bush's first acts after becoming president was to stop all US funds to foreign organisations that helped women in any way to get an abortion, including providing advice. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) lost $34m that Congress had appropriated for it in 2002.</p> <p>In a letter to Dana Hovig, chief executive officer of MSI, based in London, the assistant administrator for global health at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Kent Hill, noted that MSI did not currently receive any funds from the US government.</p> <p>\"However, we understand that in some countries, MSI receives USAID-funded contraceptives and/or condoms from host country governments that receive them from USAID,\" he wrote on September 26. In view of MSI's work as the main implementing agency for UNFPA's work in China - \"which supports the Chinese national family planning programme\" - USAID is telling its missions \"to work with these governments to ensure that no such USAID-funded commodities are distributed to MSI at this time\".</p> <p>MSI says the USAID edict will seriously hamper its work in at least six African countries - Ghana, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. USAID is the biggest supplier of contraceptives in many African countries. </p> <p>According to MSI, the inevitable consequence will be more abortions. It estimates that it will lose $1.5m worth of supplies in the next year, resulting in 325,000 extra unwanted pregnancies in the six African countries and 65,000 abortions.</p> <p>\"At a time when governments have pledged to increase their commitment to improving the health of women, only the Bush administration could find logic in the idea that they can reduce abortion and promote choice for women in China by causing more abortion,\" said Hovig.</p>",

  "<p>When Xabi Alonso first arrived in Liverpool he remembers being surprised by the number of his new team-mates who lived outside the city. Alonso wanted to be in the heart of Liverpool, somewhere where he could walk around and soak in the atmosphere, immerse himself in the culture of a new city. He was drawn to the waterfront and the sense of history around the Albert Dock, with its Grade I listed buildings, the bars and galleries, and the sweeping views of the Mersey.</p> <p>He has lived here for four years now. Him, his girlfriend, Nagore, and their seven-month-old son, Jon. It is a nice life. People wave at him in his car. Ma\u00eetre d's insist he always gets a nice table. Schoolchildren send him letters of charming clumsiness. There are even times when the players run out at Anfield and his name is sung before Steven Gerrard's. Alonso has become an honorary scouser, and it is easy to understand why he talks with such a strong affinity for his adopted city. \"It's a unique place,\" he says.</p> <p>These, however, are strange times for the man whose perceptive range of passing makes him the brains of Liverpool's midfield. \"There has been a lot of uncertainty,\" he acknowledges, reflecting on the wild graph of highs and lows that has formed his summer and, in particular, the knowledge that his time on Merseyside could easily have come to an abrupt, and wholly unsatisfactory, end.</p> <p>The highs have been exhilarating, the lows excruciating. While Alonso was helping Spain win the European Championship, he was also coming to terms with the fact that his employers were trying to sell him against his wishes. As Spain's open-top bus inched its way through the centre of Madrid - \"you had to be there to understand what those celebrations were really like,\" he says with a smile - there was always that nagging thought that Rafael Ben\u00edtez wanted to replace him with Gareth Barry. One question kept popping up in Alonso's mind: why?</p> <p>\"It was a new situation for me, something I had never experienced before,\" he says. \"I came back to the club not knowing where my future was and there was a lot of talk that I would be leaving. That was the feedback I got - that other clubs were interested in me. I'm just glad that, in the end, nothing came of it because it wasn't something I ever asked for.\"</p> <p>He could be forgiven if he feels harshly treated given his importance to the team since his \u00a310.6m signing from Real Sociedad in 2004. \"I certainly don't see myself as having anything to prove,\" he says. \"Everyone should know my quality and what I bring to the team.\"</p> <p>Yet the Spaniard is philosophical, too. \"I just have to accept that is football and this is the kind of thing that can happen. It is a fact for any footballer - you can be really happy, but if the club don't want you, you have to accept it. It's the business we're in. It is not always easy to detach yourself from things like that, but I don't want to keep looking back at how I was treated. It's part of football and the main thing is that it was all resolved and I am now playing regularly.\"</p> <p>All of which will go down well with those supporters who had taken advantage of Liverpool's pre-season game against Lazio to make it clear what they thought about losing such a popular player, repeatedly chanting his name and imploring Ben\u00edtez to change his mind. \"That meant so much to me,\" said Alonso at the launch of Fifa 09 from EA Sports. \"It was an emotional moment for me and, if I had any doubts about staying, they disappeared that night. It was the supporters' way of showing that they wanted me to stay and that they appreciated loyalty from players. Not just the local boys like Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher but foreign players like Dietmar Hamann and Sami Hyypia, and Jan Molby before them.</p> <p>\"They couldn't have done more to show me how they felt. And it was the same whenever I went into the centre of Liverpool. If I went out for lunch or a coffee, there was always someone who would come over and say, 'We'd love you to stay'. I got a few letters as well and they were all really appreciated.\"</p> <p>The fact, however, is that Alonso would have been sold if Juventus or Arsenal had come up with Liverpool's \u00a318m asking price, and there will probably always be unanswered questions about how it has affected his relationship with Ben\u00edtez. \"Professional,\" is the word Alonso uses. He also says, more than once, that there has been \"no confrontation\" and that he does not bear a grudge because \"that's not my personality\". </p> <p>Yet there are glimpses of hurt. He is asked whether, at any stage, he felt let down by his manager and his reply speaks volumes. \"You always want to feel important at wherever you are at,\" he says.</p> <p>He is also alarmed by the suggestion that Ben\u00edtez was affronted by him missing a Champions League tie against Internazionale in March to attend the birth of his son. \"I had to be with my partner,\" he explains. \"It was such a special, important moment that I took the decision that I needed to be there. Some things are more important than football and I had the full support of the club. The manager understood my decision.\"</p> <p>The impressive - and surprising - thing is that the last few months does not seem to have rocked Alonso's confidence. It cannot be very nice, in any work environment, finding out that your boss does not rate you as highly as you thought. Yet Alonso has started this season impressively. \"I feel settled again,\" he says. \"I have just concentrated on giving 100 per cent in every game.\"</p> <p>He has been influential in Liverpool's unbeaten start to the season, yet Alonso also remembers them having a good opening to last season. \"The problem was we could not sustain it,\" he says. \"We fell behind and never recovered. This time, if we want to challenge for the title, we cannot afford to have a bad month. We are going to have to be so consistent, so strong, and maintain our current form for the rest of the campaign. The first objective is to go into the Christmas programme still in contention. If you are eight or nine points adrift at that stage, as we were last season then you are out of it, and we don't want a repeat of that.\"</p> <p>They play at Manchester City tomorrow and Alonso is intrigued by his first look at the Premier League's nouveau riche billionaires. \"It's strange because you know that it could be unfair in some ways. I don't know if it needs to be regulated. Otherwise the clubs owned by billionaires will be here [he points upwards] and the ones owned by millionaires will be several levels below.\" It is an interesting take, although Alonso is aware that Liverpool also have wealthy admirers. \"I wouldn't be surprised,\" he says, \"if something happens in the future here too.\"</p> <p>If so, he would like to be there to experience it, although he is understandably wary about looking too far ahead. \"I could see myself staying here a lot more years, but maybe this summer something might happen again. You have to be happy at the club but the club has to be happy with you too. All I can say is that I'm really happy here. There are not many better clubs to play football for than Liverpool.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair was once asked why he persisted in keeping such a divisive figure as Peter Mandelson at his elbow. Blair explained that in a major crisis (there certainly is one now) most colleagues would say: \"What shall we do?\" \"Peter would say: 'We must do this, this and this.' \"</p> <p>Back in the early 1990s, when Blair, Mandelson and Gordon Brown were battling to create what became New Labour's winning formula, Brown knew that too. Alastair Campbell's diaries describe a triangular relationship of almost sexual intensity between the three arch-modernisers.</p> <p>But Mandelson's decision to back Blair to succeed John Smith when the then Labour leader died in 1994 created a powerful enmity. Mandelson had always been a convenient hate figure for many Labour MPs and activists. Brown was now on his case, too. </p> <p>The Brownites meant to do him harm, though Mandelson helped. His own behaviour brought him down, over his secret \u00a3373,000 loan (1998), if not the Hinduja passport resignation (2001). That sacking was unfair: Blair panicked.</p> <p>Why has Brown changed his mind? Labour MPs were divided yesterday, a typical Mandelson effect. Some were appalled at a \"desperate\" move. Others proclaimed a masterstroke, proof that Brown retains the will to survive, to be unexpectedly bold and fight back against the Cameron tide. </p> <p>The Tories will make \"back to the future\" jokes, but the Prince of Darkness has always frightened them. The bookies' election odds will change. </p> <p>With hindsight, there have been signs of a rapprochement. In 2007 Brown came in declaring he would correct his own defects as well as Blair's, his \"government of all the talents\" phase which fizzled out with the aborted election. As the Tories roared ahead Blair, Campbell and Mandelson were being consulted again. This summer Mandelson decided that Labour should stick with Brown - and that he should rally to his stricken party.</p> <p>Attempts to kickstart the No 10 machine had failed. In the government's twin crises - global economics and domestic politics - heavyweight experience suddenly looked attractive.</p> <p>But his re-emergence is bound to be divisive. It already is. The leftwing MP, John McDonnell, protested yesterday that Mandelson was a bad administrator as well as bad politician, a symbol of \"failed\" Blairism.</p> <p>Understandable, but wrong: he was rated as trade secretary (1999-2001) and - though controversial as ever - as an anti-protectionist in Brussels. His global contacts and business cred may help boost confidence. Does the arch-Blairite's return prove that Brown's running feud with Blair - Mandelson shot in the crossfire - was entirely about personal ambition, not political differences? Up to a point. They were modernisers, impatient with failed nostrums of the left. But Brown was always more statist, less impressed by market solutions although it suited him to tax City excesses rather than curb them.</p> <p>Even before his Manchester conference speech, which trimmed David Cameron's 20% poll lead, Brown has seemed cheerier to many who see him up close. The financial crisis has snapped him out of his gloom, given him renewed purpose and a glimpse of a pathway out of defeat. The prodigal Mandelson will now be part of it.</p> <p>It may all end in recrimination again. But like Cameron, Brown is a \"man with a plan\" too. \"Third time lucky,\" said Mandelson as he returned to No 10.</p>",
  "<p>A week in, there seems to be consensus over what Joe Kinnear can hope to bring to Newcastle United during his six-game spell of New Deal Senior Jobseeker workplace experience. \"Joe can give us a thing or two,\" Michael Owen said. \"The first thing I would suggest is confidence.\" For Harry Redknapp \"self-belief is the key\" and \"one thing Joe is good at is motivating players\". So there you have it. Much like the violently convulsing global economy, it's all about confidence. Newcastle don't have any. Can Kinnear get them some? And if so, how quickly?</p> <p>This is a question football has wrestled with for some time, usually in relation to scoring goals. The most common theory is that a player low on confidence \"just needs one to go in off his backside\". The mechanics of this are not entirely clear. Neurological research has suggested sudden impact to the backside may affect the part of the brain that controls the vital weak-dink-at-the-keeper reflex. Others maintain this is a purely sensual response to the comforting slap of ball on buttock.</p> <p>There are also complications. We are told that success breeds confidence. At the same time, confidence breeds success. Confidence also breeds confidence. And of course, nothing breeds success like success. In football circles this kind of reasoning is usually described as ontologically reductive - or, in plain philosophy-speak, a right load of tosh. For the time being, Kinnear simply doesn't have time to unravel these kind of semantic conundrums. </p> <p>Luckily, some believe confidence can be produced in other ways - mainly by employing a \"big personality\". </p> <p>Managers with big personalities radiate confidence. Terry Venables can \"lift a club just by walking through the door\", smiling, waving and wearing a tracksuit. Graham Taylor did it by appearing on the touchline, revolving his arms and blowing out his chest like an excited gorilla. The results spoke for themselves. </p> <p>Does Kinnear have a big personality? At Wimbledon he found a niche as a straight-talking, get-it-in-the-mixer-early-doors sergeant major type. Almost a decade on, it's hard to remember specifically what brand of edgy, maverick charisma he might bring to the St James' Park dressing room. </p> <p>In the interests of journalistic rigour, then, a cursory flick through Hunter Davies's 1972 book The Glory Game, in which Kinnear appears as a Tottenham player, provides the following profile. His interests were \"tennis, clothes and pop music\". His pre-match superstition involved not putting his shorts on until the last moment - \"until then I walk around in my jock strap\". And after retiring he thought he might do \"something in fashion\". </p> <p>Plenty to work on there, you'd have thought. And if, on this occasion, getting someone in to stroll about in his jockstrap, listening to Rod Stewart, waving a tennis racket and talking about opening a boutique doesn't quite do the job confidence-wise, the club can always fall back on the emergency tactic currently being put to good use by the convulsing global economy: the massive, non-refundable cash injection. </p> <p>Come to think of it, maybe it would be best just to have a check of the exact figures with those Nigerian chaps.</p>",

We put the money on deposit to generate interest and help pay the rent on a new place. I can afford much more space for the same money renting than I would have done if I'd bought. Initially the money was all with one institution. But after Northern Rock last year I decided it would be better to spread it out between different accounts. The other reason renting can be a good idea is that you save a fortune on repairs to boilers, walls, roofs and the like.</p> <p><strong>Regrets?</strong><br>No. Apart from the \u00a3750 I spent fixing my car, a Skoda Octavia, which I bought because I thought it would have a reliable VW engine. I suppose it was a worthwhile investment. But spending the money felt horrible.</p> <p><strong>Top tip?</strong><br>If it were last year - and this is just a personal view - I would have said sell your house, put your money on deposit and rent for a while. Apart from the safety, the psychological benefit of having money on deposit is huge. You are also much more flexible if you need to move. But my top investment tip is actually rather boring. Pay off your debts. It's one of very few investments that is totally tax exempt and you also get a guaranteed rate of return.</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get?</strong><br>Why bad? If you're talking about unemployment, that's bad - the most devastating thing that can happen to you financially, apart from divorce or serious illness. But if you stay in work, there are lots of things that are good financially. House prices are coming down. That's good for anyone who either has never been able to afford one or who wants to trade up. It's only bad for those who've been wrongly relying on their house price as an index of wealth. Where else do we talk about prices coming down as \"bad\"? Clothes are getting cheaper, so's technology. And with the slowdown now underway across the world, petrol should get cheaper. On the other hand, taxes may have to go up sharply to pay for tax credits for all those people who are going to become reliant on them to get by.

Having bought a new property last summer, I could fret about the fact that prices have been on the decline since, but I'm actually very happy with the purchase as a home for the long term. The fact that I was a seller too meant I also sold at the top of the market, and any equity gain on the sale was shifted into the purchase.</p> <p><strong>Top tip?</strong><br>Make sure you shop across the mortgage market and if possible reduce your mortgage debt rather than increase it.

I've had the same bank account for 23 years! However, I think the government should do exactly what the Irish government has done for their banks and announce that all deposits in all major UK banks are underwritten. People say this would cost trillions but the reality is that it would cost nothing.

And with that, things will continue moving. Is it going to get worse? I think if everybody can be a bit more sensible and grown-up, then it should not last too long. It's not as bad as everyone says. People are still buying things in shops. Are the bars empty because everyone is broke? No. We were in a period of unsustainable gluttony, and now is a much more realistic place to be.</p> <h2>Mark Dampier - Head of research at IFA firm Hargreaves Lansdown</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338260808\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/02/07/Mark-Dampier220.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Dampier of Hargreaves Lansdown\" width=\"220\" height=\"180\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What are you doing?</strong><br>I am now in my early 50s so pension planning has become a big focus for me. In fact, savings generally has, and I use an Isa and Sipp (self-invested personal pension) for this. I am highly geared to the market because, first, I work in financial services, so my salary comes directly from this. And second, I have a large part of my wealth tied up in Hargreaves Lansdown shares, which means I am very geared to the stock market. Therefore within both my Sipp and Isa I have become gradually more defensive. However there are some exceptions to this!</p> <p><strong>Regrets?</strong><br>Given the state of the stockmarket, I suppose any regret might be that I invested any money at all. Even in corporate bonds there have been disappointments because, despite the fund managers suggesting there was such compelling value in financials, corporate bonds have, with the exception of M&amp;G Optimal - which I have in my portfolio - done poorly. The risk-reward characteristics have been turned on their head, as high yield has done better than investment-grade corporate bonds because they have no exposure to financials. Other than that, I have been placing more money into Neptune Russia as the stockmarket there has continued to fall. Frankly, on about four times earnings, it looks the cheapest market in the world. I have also placed more money in our own HL Income and Growth Portfolio. Despite the performance of UK income funds in 2007 and early 2008, with yields of between 4% and 6% net and my view that interest rates are going to fall extremely sharply, I think this is one sector of the market that is well worth accumulating on the poor days. </p> <p><strong>Top tip?</strong><br>The repayment of debt is the major one. I think we will see a very different environment whereby people won't instantly be able to get what they want and will now have to save up for it. I would also suggest that people build up an emergency fund of money. I am amazed at how few people have three to six months salary behind them. Apart from cash, I believe regular savings plans into pensions and Isas should be continued and increased, allowing investors to pick up cheap units and iron out the market moves.</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get?</strong><br>I do think you need to divorce the stockmarket from the economy. The stockmarket is a discounting mechanism, so will bottom well before the economy. When I look at the FTSE, there is certainly plenty of good value at a level between 4000 and 5000. At around 4800 the FTSE is yielding more than the 10-year gilt and below 4500 will be yielding more than cash. While I know there will be dividend cuts, I do believe good fund managers will avoid the worst of these. The economy, on the other hand, looks dreadful and I see 2009 being a recessionary year. House prices will continue to fall with a total drop in excess of 25% and unemployment will continue to rise. The deleveraging process will be painful and consumer spending will be drastically reduced, but savings rates will at last increase.</p> <h2>Martin Lewis - Financial expert and founder of <a href=\"http://MoneySavingExpert.com\">MoneySavingExpert.com</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338261334\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/06/12/MartinLewis.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Lewis, the money saving expert\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Nell Freeman</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nell Freeman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What are you doing?</strong><br>My \"savings safety\" article has been read 800,000 times in the last fortnight.

I tend to practise what I preach. Before I buy anything, I always ask myself: 1) will I use it? 2) is it worth it? 3) can I find it cheaper anywhere else? When it comes to investing, the nature of my job means I don't invest in any individual shares because I don't feel it's appropriate with what I do.

Simply take a day at a weekend to systematically work through your finances. The average person in the UK is throwing away 20% of their salary by spending too much on products.</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get?</strong><br>At this time, the vote in the US hasn't happened yet. For me, that is a defining moment of our financial generation. If the bail-out happens, I think we will have a recession, with unemployment rising up to the two million level and house prices continuing to drop, and a period of substantial belt-tightening. If they don't vote in favour of the bail-out, then I think we will have a recession that makes the early 80s look like a walk in the park.</p> <h2>Deborah Hargreaves - Business editor, the Guardian</h2> <p><strong>What are you doing? </strong><br>I have recently topped up my savings in the Post Office Instant Saver account which is run by Bank of Ireland and so now benefits from a blanket guarantee for two years.</p> <p><strong>Regrets? </strong><br>At the beginning of this year, I sold half of my shares in Pearson that I had accumulated from previous share savings schemes. I should have sold them all. I invested my pension AVC in a balanced half-shares, half-bond fund when I should have opted for the safer all bonds and cash option.</p> <p><strong>Top tip?</strong><br>I always give people the same advice. The only safe investments are National Savings - I have saved for all of my children's university fees through their products. Of course, Northern Rock is now protected too. I have been arguing with friends about why buy-to-let is not a great option for years.</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get? </strong><br>I am worried that it could get a lot worse.

What crystallised the problems that had been below the surface was a fall in house prices in the US, and so house prices need to stabilise for the situation to improve significantly. How quickly that happens will depend to a large extent on government action. The situation in the UK could nevertheless be helped by decisive government action rather than dithering most of the time. For example, I suspect the flow of funds to Irish banks will before long force the government to offer a 100% guarantee on UK bank deposits. However, I think UK house prices will stabilise by the middle of next year on the back of sharply lower interest rates.</p> <h2>Ian Marsh - Professor of finance, Cass Business School</h2> <p><strong>What are you doing?</strong><br>Cash holdings diversified across banks and currencies.

Most people I talk to have a vague idea of their savings - the \u00a335,000 guaranteed limit is not that much for some people. Make sure you are taking advantage of the insurance out there. You are paying for it because the government will use taxes if necessary to fund this. Also, be very careful with big payments. Should you by some miracle sell your house, the cash you deposit is not covered.</p> <p><strong>How bad will it get?</strong><br>Potentially way worse. All this has been caused by losses in the subprime US housing market. Had you heard of that market three years ago? Me neither.

Following the philosophy of \"wild planting in a tight design\", he has explored naturalistic planting for 30-plus years. Piet Oudolf is undoubtedly more commercially savvy, having turned these ideas into a global brand, but Gerritsen can take credit for pushing at the edges and developing a new approach.</p> <p>Priona, in Schuinesloot, was started in 1978 with Anton Schlepers. Gerritsen describes the design principle simply: \"What is straight should be curved, what is curved should be straight.\" So in a garden where the walls or fences are straight, the paths and other landscaping should be erratic, with sloping paths, curved hedges and arcing borders. Conversely, in a shapeless garden, straight lines are needed.</p> <p>Gerritsen's philosophy is to respect the full cycle of life, allowing wild and cultivated plants to grow side by side in natural-looking environments. Weeds and pests are tolerated as essential parts of the beauty of the garden. His work always has an unexpected element to it.

  "<p>Stephen Hammond, a Conservative transport spokesman, says his party has spent a year \"working\" on its plan for a London-Manchester-Leeds rail link as a substitute for a third runway at Heathrow (Report, October 2). Has he read the plan? Does he realise that its claim that this high-speed route could replace 66,500 flights a year is an uncritical lift from the anti-Heathrow campaign group, Hacan? Half an hour on Google could have told him that there are 10,000 flights a year between Heathrow and Manchester and 3,000 between Heathrow and Leeds-Bradford.</p> <p>Take away all those and the \"saving\" in Heathrow's runway capacity is less than 3% - under a fifth of the Conservatives' claim - and even that's not till 2027. Does Mr Hammond also realise that his plan's claim for CO2 emissions savings is an uncritical lift from the train manufacturer, Alstom? According to Alstom, rail travel is 70 times cleaner than flying. According to the Commission for Integrated Transport, rail's advantage is 2.3 times. Given this quality of research, what has the Conservative transport team been doing for a year? I think party funders should be told. High-speed rail and runway expansion are not alternatives. The UK's national hub needs both. An absence of serious policy analysis is a betrayal of all transport users.<br><strong>Willie Walsh</strong><br>British Airways </p> <p>The reaction of the airline industry to the Conservative party's proposal to scrap plans for a third runway at Heathrow is predictable but flawed. BAA and British Airways are bound to lobby on behalf of their own interests, but their economic arguments don't add up. The evidence is now clear that the prosperity of the entire UK economy does not hinge on the expansion of one airport in south-east England. Over the past decade, as other European airports have expanded more quickly than Heathrow, business has come to London in record numbers. </p> <p>Hundreds of flights leave Heathrow every day for cities like Paris, Manchester, and Brussels, and these could easily be cut if our railways were improved across the board. The experience of countries such as France shows that a sensibly priced, high-speed rail system does attract a significant number of air passengers. The Conservatives are right to expect something similar would happen at Heathrow, negating any need for a third runway. The government's job is to put the UK's long-term interests first. In years to come, David Cameron's decision will be seen as a moment when our political leaders faced up to the urgency of action on climate change.<br><strong>John Stewart</strong>, Hacan, <strong>Tim Johnson</strong>, Aviation Environment Federation, <strong>Stephen Joseph</strong>, Campaign for Better Transport, <strong>Stephen Hale</strong>, Green Alliance, <strong>John Sauven</strong>, Greenpeace, <strong>Benedict Southwark</strong>, World Develoment Movement, <strong>David Norman</strong>, WWF-UK.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday's decision to create a government department for energy and climate change is a key move to help the UK switch to renewables. The new minister, Ed Miliband, is charged with establishing what energy the country needs and the most environmentally sound way of getting it.</p> <p>Though this is a new political imperative after Brown made the promotion of energy efficiency a part of his leadership relaunch in September, he is thought to have considered creating the department when he first became prime minister.</p> <p>Now he has finally done it and given a platform to an ally and rising star. Although it is Miliband's first frontline job, as a former Treasury adviser he will bring clout. A senior government source said the department had been created for three reasons. He said: \"Higher global energy prices mean reducing demand for energy is now as central to energy policy as its supply: these have to be integrated. </p> <p>\"The climate change bill imposes legally binding carbon budgets on the whole of government - the department responsible for managing them needs to be able to deliver them. And the need for an international climate agreement next year has put this high up the government's diplomatic agenda.\" The move was broadly welcomed by green lobby groups. \"Ed Miliband's in-tray is piled high with issues that the old structure did not resolve,\" says Stephen Hale, director of Green Alliance. A former adviser to Margaret Beckett when she was environment minister, he recalled the ideological clash between the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, and the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The former would tell the government the targets that needed to be met, while the latter ran the strategy for delivery. \"Now the people who make these assumptions will be sitting next to the people whose job it is to think about climate change,\" said Hale.</p> <p>Top of Miliband's in-tray is whether to halt plans for the construction at Kingsnorth in Kent of the UK's first coal-fired power station for 30 years. His brother, foreign secretary David Miliband, has been arguing that no new coal-fired power station should be built.</p> <p>At the Labour conference, former industry secretary John Hutton made a speech in favour of Kingsnorth and the next day Gordon Brown used part of his speech as leader to argue for clean coal.</p> <p>Miliband will also have to decide whether to allow his department officials to continue lobbying to change the EU's commitment on renewables. At the moment, the UK is trying to remove aviation emissions from the targets but again, last week's speech indicated the department may be pushing at an open door since Brown also pledged to ask the climate change committee to consider raising the target for a reduction in carbon emissions to 80% from 60%.</p> <p>Again, when he was environment secretary, David Miliband championed the idea of personal carbon allowances. It will be interesting to see whether his brother pushes through similarly radical ideas.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown yesterday created a new 19-strong national economic council as he effectively put the government on an economic war footing. </p> <p>He has added muscle to his team with the appointment of Paul Myners, chairman of the Guardian Media Group and a former chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, as City spokesman. </p> <p>Stephen Carter, Brown's former strategy adviser at No 10 and now communications minister, will also sit on the council.</p> <p>Myners and Carter will be made peers, alongside Peter Mandelson, the new business secretary. </p> <p>The economic sub-committee is expected to meet twice a week and act as the focus of the government's effort to stave off recession, the global crisis in the financial markets and volatile prices.</p> <p>The move may clip the wings of the Treasury, which will have to share much of the key economic analysis with the Cabinet Office. </p> <p>But Brown said he was seeking \"to reconstruct the way we govern to meet the new challenges coming from financial instability, oil price rises, food shortages and by making the right investments in science and technology. We need to have a sharper focus on all these areas.\" </p> <p>He predicted that every government would reconstruct their ways of working in a similar fashion over the next few months.</p> <p>\"The new problems have completely changed, so it is not just what the Treasury does, but also energy, food and housing,\" the prime minister said.</p> <p>The new committee has already been dubbed an economic version of the exisiting Cobra emergency committee.</p> <p>Lady Vadera, the minister for economic competitiveness and small business, and a close ally of Brown's, will also attend. </p> <p>Margaret Beckett, the former foreign secretary, who has been appointed housing minister, will also be there. </p> <p>Brown knows that the state of the mortgage market will be one of the key determinants of the next election. </p> <p>He will chair the committee that will be attended by all the main economic departments, including the Treasury, business, the Foreign Office, energy and climate change, innovation and skills, communities and local government. </p> <p>In a further sign of the committee's importance, Ed Balls, the children, schools and families secretary, and a former chief economic adviser to the Treasury, will also attend. </p> <p>Downing Street also announced that a working group of senior officials, to be chaired by the cabinet secretary, Sir Gus O'Donnell, and the permanent secretary at the Treasury, Nicholas Macpherson, will meet regularly with the permanent secretaries of all departments whose ministers serve on the national economic council.</p> <p>The council will meet for the first time on Monday ahead of a statement in the Commons by the chancellor, Alistair Darling . </p> <p>A network of business ambassadors will also be established to support the government overseas. </p> <p>Among the appointments are Sir John Bond, chairman of Vodafone, Lord Browne, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering and former BP boss, Marcus Agius, chairman of Barclays, and Sir Victor Blank, chairman of Lloyds TSB.</p> <h2>Profile: Paul Myners</h2> <p>Paul Myners has risen from inner city schoolteacher to become one of the City grandees called upon by the government when economic disaster strikes.

  "<h2>Retail</h2> <p>The scale of the problem facing the UK's shopkeepers was underlined yesterday by middle England's favourite department store chain, John Lewis: its sales last week were down 8% on 12 months ago - a grim figure, but actually boosted by the still-growing John Lewis online operation and its Oxford Street flagship store. Strip them out and the position in the group's city centre and retail mall locations is far more gloomy. In most of its stores sales were down more than 16%. Some were far worse.</p> <p>M&amp;S boss Sir Stuart Rose summed up the problem when he unveiled his own dire sales performance last week: shoppers, he said, are worried about inflation, interest rates, house prices, their jobs and \"the safety of their money in their banks\".</p> <p>The number of shoppers visiting out-of-town shopping centres, such as Bluewater and Cribbs Causeway, has declined dramatically. Those that do venture out are searching for bargains. Sales of organic food and premium products have ground to a halt and the fastest growing supermarkets are now Aldi, Lidl and Iceland. </p> <p>A number of retailers have already collapsed into administration in recent months and more will follow. The auditors to the 400-strong JJB chain have warned that it may not survive.</p> <p>Car dealers have been suffering almost as much as estate agents. August sales of new cars were down 19% and, according to the Pendragon car dealership group, which operates more than 330 Stratstone and Evans Halshaw outlets, the price of used cars is falling fast and has \"some way to go\". September's new car sales figures are due on Monday and are expected to be even worse.</p> <p>How much worse? Well, yesterday there was more evidence that the squeeze on spending will continue: over the past three months housing equity withdrawal - where homebuyers increase the size of their mortgage, usually to pay for big purchases like cars, holidays and home improvements - has stopped dead. It is a stark contrast to the \u00a35bn of housing equity withdrawn in the previous three months - and the \u00a310bn withdrawn in the same three months of last year.</p> <p>October to December is the \"golden season\" for retail. Some stores, including book and music stores and jewellers, do the bulk of their business in the weeks before Christmas. But, according to one of the City's leading retail analysts, the UK is heading for its worst festive season in 30 years.</p> <h2>Houses</h2> <p>The average value of a home, according to the Nationwide, is down \u00a323,000 from its peak last year. Property values are down 12.4% on a year ago, the largest annual fall ever recorded by the mortgage lender.</p> <p>There is plenty of evidence, however, that in some places, prices have fallen far more dramatically. A City housing analyst last week said he had toured developments in northern cities and discovered \"carnage beyond even our most bearish expectations\". </p> <p>Prices of city centre apartments, he said, were down by up to 50% and there were still no buyers. He described the market for apartments in central Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and Sheffield as \"a near-apocalyptic landscape\". </p> <p>The mortgage market has changed beyond recognition. Loans are more expensive and buyers need sizeable deposits. Even then they may not get a loan because some lenders are valuing homes on what they might be worth in three months' time.</p> <p>How low are prices going?There is plenty of room for more falls. Property prices are still more than 60% higher in real terms than they were at the start of the decade. The gloomiest predictions are for houses to lose 35% from their peak, which means another \u00a340,000 could be wiped off the average house price. </p> <h2>Banks</h2> <p>So far the world's banks have reported mortgage-related losses of $500bn (\u00a3280bn). But that won't be the end of it. The final bill for the sub-prime scandal, it is reckoned by the IMF, might be $900bn - or even up to $1,600bn.</p> <p>Jobs have gone at every investment bank in the City and the clearout is just beginning. The Hay Group is forecasting more than 100,000 City job losses.</p> <p>Now, however, the banking crisis has widened to the high street banks, and there will be many thousands more redundancies across the UK, as ordinary tellers pay the price for highly-paid traders' losses.</p> <p>Two thousand staff have been axed at Northern Rock and many thousands more will go at Bradford &amp; Bingley, Alliance &amp; Leicester and as a result of the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>The look of the UK's high streets will change. Instead of multiple bank branches there will be just four big players, lending less money and being far more choosy about who they do business with. </p> <p>There will be less competition and current accounts will become more expensive.</p> <h2>Stockmarket</h2> <p>The FTSE 100 has fallen 25% in the last year - that qualifies as a bear market if you use the usual rule-of-thumb of a 20% fall from the peak and is bad news for anyone with a pension or an ISA.</p> <p>The banks, and their cousins the property companies, have suffered some of the most spectacular falls. </p> <p>Tumbles among housebuilders and estate agents are also not so surprising.</p> <p>But more recent falls illustrate how the stockmarket is starting to price in the possibility of a global recession. The least-publicised crash in share prices can be seen in the mining sector. Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Xstrata - four of the world's biggest commodity companies - have seen their stockmarket values roughly halve in the past four months.</p> <p>This is because the prices of almost all industrial metals are falling.

On the narrow \"claimant count\" measure, unemployment jumped 32,500 in August from July, the biggest rise since December 1992 - during the last recession - and the seventh increase in a row. </p> <p>On the wider Labour Force Survey measure, joblessness rose 81,000 to 1.72 million between May and July, the highest level since 1999. The data also showed a 71,000 jump in the number who had left the workforce because they could not find a job.</p> <p>Those numbers don't even include job losses in the City, which will take a few more months to hit the figures, or in construction, which is a sector in meltdown.</p> <p>How many more will be visiting the Job Centre soon? Predictions are for another 300,000 - to 2 million - by Christmas, after what one expert called an \"avalanche\" of autumn job losses.</p> <p>That number could well rise sharply through next year and could even approach the 3 million jobless total which was seen in the last recession during the early 1990s.</p> <h2>Inflation</h2> <p>The nightmare for the Bank of England would be that the high inflation of recent months, caused by previous rises in oil and commodity prices, pushes through into wage inflation, making it difficult for it to cut interest rates to ward off recession. Fortunately, so far there is little sign of that happening. Wage growth has been very benign as inflation has risen and experts say it will be pressured downwards by rising joblessness in the coming months.</p> <p>Also, oil prices are down to $93 a barrel from a July record of $147 a barrel. </p> <p>The world economy is slowing rapidly, putting downward pressure on commodity price inflation. Inflation hit 4.7% in August and is likely to peak at around 4.8% for September before falling fast. Even the Bank of England has projected that inflation will be back below its 2% target in two years' time - but some economists think it could be closer to zero.</p> <h2>Manufacturing</h2> <p>For the past year or so the Bank of England has been hoping that industry would take over from the flagging consumer as the main driver of the economy. </p> <p>After all, the pound was sliding, making firms' goods cheaper in foreign markets and the eurozone, our main export market, was growing healthily.</p> <p>But, as so often with new dawns for manufacturing, it has turned out to be a false dawn. </p> <p>The eurozone looks headed into recession as fast as Britain and this week's CIPS survey of the sector slumped to a record low, with export orders their weakest in six years. </p> <p>With manufacturing having shed a million jobs in the past 10 years and with its output having not grown in all that time, it now only accounts for around 14% of the economy so even if it recovered strongly, there are limits to how far it could counterbalance recession in the far larger services sector, which accounts for more like 70% of economic output. </p> <p>Manufacturing, far from helping the economy recover, has tumbled back into recession, soon to be joined by retailing, the services sector and construction.</p> <p>Land Rover have put staff on a four-day week and Ford said this week it was doing the same at its Transit van production plant in Southampton.

McAllister, who was part of the Network Rail bid team which took Railtrack out of administration in 2002, will step down at the annual meeting next July. Network Rail said Henderson, who has been with the company since October 2002, has decided to retire but will stay to ensure a smooth handover to his successor.

Russian Machines, part of the billionaire's Basic Element, bought the stake last year in a $1.5bn (\u00a3850m) deal. It was one of his biggest overseas investments at the time, and involved putting up the Magna stock as collateral. Magna said that the unnamed Russian Machines creditor would dispose of the shares at its discretion.

The further reductions came a day after UBS said it had made a \"small\" profit in the third quarter, its first for more than a year. The investment bank, the source of toxic investments that sullied UBS's reputation for prudence, is to see activities such as most commodities trading, real estate and securitisation operations, closed or curtailed. The latest cutbacks will reduce headcount at the investment banking arm to 17,000. <br><strong>David Gow in Brussels</strong></p>",
  "<p>What's green, economical and reduces congestion? The answer is cyber hitching \u2013 websites, such as <a href=\"http://www.carshare.com\">carshare.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.liftshare.org\">liftshare.org</a>, that put travellers in touch with car drivers to share journeys and petrol costs. And in these times of financial uncertainty, they are racking up a huge global following. </p> <p>Hitchhiking has long been a cheap but unreliable mode of travel, but the advantage of finding a lift online is that, rather than just sticking out your thumb and hoping for the best, you can find out about your driver in advance, consider compatibility, and check references left by other travellers. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.Avego.com\">Avego.com</a> is the latest site to emerge and looks set to be the most hi-tech. Their service, which is currently recruiting beta testers, allows drivers to use GPS-enabled Apple iPhones to register their location/destination and be matched with like-minded passengers, who can use any \"common cell phone\" to send lift requests via text. </p> <p>Traditional hitching also appears to be undergoing an internet-fuelled revival. This month, <a href=\"http://www.Hitchwiki.org\">Hitchwiki.org</a> \u2013 an open, wiki site that enables hitchers to post their own tips and features \u2013 celebrates reaching 1,000 articles. </p> <p>\"I'd be cautious of recommending off-the-cuff hitching to travellers,\" says Sally Broom, founder of travel network <a href=\"http://www.YourSafePlanet.com\">YourSafePlanet.com</a>. \"However, the online sites offer a system that has some backup, a sort of paper trail that you can trace back. With a little planning, travellers should be able to share lifts safely, rather than taking the chance of traditional hitchhiking.\"</p> <p>Broom recommends asking for references, swapping identity documents before getting in the car, and adds, \"If a situation feels wrong, don't get in.\" </p> <p>The current rising star in online ridesharing is <a href=\"http://www.PickupPal.com\">PickupPal.com</a>, described by its founders as an \"eBay for transportation\", where passengers request a lift and drivers set a fee. Founded in January, it now has 100,000 members worldwide and the original 7% commission charge has now been scrapped, leaving it free to join, like most of the others. </p> <p>Co-founder Eric Dewhirst says he has noticed a significant increase in new sign-ups since mid-September, when the world flew into financial turmoil. \"The only thing that we can attribute this to is our members looking at ways to weather this economic storm by doing more with the resources they have,\" he says.</p> <p>Ironically, the founders hit a hurdle in their home province of Ontario, where a bizarre transport law has deemed it <a href=\"http://save.pickuppal.com/\">illegal</a>. </p> <p>They are hoping to convince authorities to overturn this legislation at an October 15 hearing, so PickupPal can keep on trucking.

  "<p>I first heard about the principles of what is now called the \"cloud\" but was then called \"network computing\" at a talk given many years ago by Larry Ellison. Ellison's fortune (he is one of the richest men on the planet) came from Oracle, a leading database and \"enterprise\" computing company. Enterprise software and computing can be thought of as a kind of proactive intranet, a closed system that \"powers\" (don't you just hate the current use of that verb?) everything from business databases to the corporate accounts of BlackBerry users. </p> <p>Enterprise systems will tend to hold applications and files on servers. A server is a dedicated storage and processing computer designed transparently to handle tasks for a network of individual \"client\" computers, the ones humans actually use. Think of client computers as having screens and keyboards, while servers are stored in racks. The old model of computing required applications to be installed on desk/laptops, each machine an autonomous island. Bridges were built between them by disk-swapping and LAN connection. Even today, most of us will use our computers this way, but now with memory sticks instead of floppies and the internet instead of LAN. People often save data online in the ether or \"cloud\" simply by keeping it on their gmail or hotmail folders. How many times have you sent yourself a photo just so you can have a copy of it online? But many of us are beginning to dabble in true online applications and storage, in cloud computing. The advantage is that files can be created, stored and accessed from any online computer in the world. The network holds not only your files, but the applications that create them, while your computer is, as in the early days, little more than a dumb terminal. A stolen laptop becomes a nuisance like a lost chequebook - a bit of password changing and ringing round, perhaps, but the valuable data is stored elsewhere. We save to the cloud and only back up to our computer.</p> <p>If you want to put a head in the clouds, I recommend a number of services. Google has a full online office suite, but if you feel that the big G is powerful enough, thank you, then <a href=\"http://www.zoho.com\">zoho.com</a> offers a similar, if not even richer, range. Web applications can now mimic desktop software, so the kinds of keyboard shortcuts used on your desktop spreadsheet programme, for example, are now possible on the web equivalent. For those too bohemian to be attracted by anything smelling of an office, there is <a href=\"http://www.jooce.com\">jooce.com</a>, which gives users a customisable desktop and Instant Messaging tools - worth a look just to show you how far the online virtual desktop environment can go.</p> <p>Apple's .Mac service allowed online storage for years in the shape of a virtual \"iDisk\" before it was recently rebranded as MobileMe (Mac or PC), which horrible name was attended by a spectacularly flaky launch. The service, now stable and working, allows contacts and calendar information as well as email to be \"pushed\" - in other words, arrive without you having to collect it. My PA and I each have my diary on our iPhones. When we amend an entry, the alteration more or less instantly appears on the other's phone as well as on the MobileMe online web apps and all computers logged into the same account. There are problems: full synchronisation with Google's more function-rich calendar relies on third-party utilities; alterations and additions are not \"flagged\"; the push sometimes needs a push itself in the form of a manual synchronisation, but it points to how things will be.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.SugarSync.com\">SugarSync.com</a> is an online file-storage service that comes with excellent applications for iPhone, Windows Mobile, BlackBerry and, shortly no doubt, Google Android. If you have coverage, you can access all the files on all your computers. They don't even need to be online, for all is on the server, all is in the cloud.</p> <p>Google, Zoho and Jooce cost nothing. MobileMe and SugarSync charge, so I suggest taking advantage of their free trial offers. Security? Ah, well, that's a whole other ball of wax. Are your jewels safer at home or in someone else's safety deposit box? Questions don't get mooter.</p> <h2>Initials of the week</h2> <p><strong>LAN</strong> Local area network.

  "<p>Taylor Wimpey, the debt-laden housebuilder, warned yesterday that talks to renegotiate its borrowing agreements would take longer than expected.</p> <p>The group, which had net debt of \u00a31.7bn at the end of June, said it expected to have a revised covenant structure by early next year. It had previously anticipated this would be achieved by the end of this year. News of the delay saw Taylor Wimpey shares fall by more than 3% to a low of 31.5p, before closing up 0.25p at 34.75p.</p> <p>Taylor Wimpey said the hold-up was a result of the decision to include eurobond holders in the negotiations.</p> <p>In a statement it said discussions to amend the provisions governing its existing borrowings were \"continuing on a constructive basis\". </p> <p>It added: \"The co-ordinating banks have indicated it is their intention to agree to replace the covenants with a revised set ... which are more appropriate to the current market environment.\"</p> <p>In August, at its interim results, Taylor Wimpey said it was in full compliance with its borrowing covenants but warned it was likely to breach them over the full year.</p> <p>Yesterday it said: \"The recent unprecedented events in world financial markets have reinforced the board's cautious view of the short-term outlook for UK housing.</p> <p>\"In the current environment, securing a comprehensive financing structure that is robust under all reasonable downside scenarios is essential.</p> <p>\"To that end the board has decided to extend discussions with debt providers to include applicable eurobond holders, which will prolong the negotiation process. The group remains in compliance with its existing covenant package and has adequate facilities.\"</p> <p>One analyst, who declined to be named, said that, should Taylor Wimpey breach its bank debt conditions or its US private placement debt conditions, bondholders could \"cry default\" and press for early redemption of their \u00a3450m in debt. The analyst added that the extension of the discussions brought eurobond holders into the main arena and was \"recognition of the presence of the threat [of default]\". </p> <p>The problems facing the UK housing market were underlined by Nationwide this week. The building society reported that house prices fell 1.7% in September, an 11th successive monthly decline. </p> <p>Average prices have tumbled by \u00a323,000 since their peak last October, while the 12.4% annual rate of decline is the largest since the Nationwide first published its monthly snapshot in the early 1990s.</p>",
  "<p>The government last night announced dramatic action to ease the credit crunch when it raised the guarantee on savings to \u00a350,000 and took steps to thaw the freeze on business financing.</p> <p>Amid fresh signs that the economy is on the brink of recession, the Financial Services Authority said it would increase the security on deposits from \u00a335,000 with effect from Tuesday and would consider a further rise if it proved necessary.</p> <p>After the US House of Representatives last night narrowly agreed to the $700bn bail-out of toxic mortgages, British authorities hope that confidence will begin to return to the global financial system and ease the pressures on UK banks. Government sources said, however, that ministers were planning for \"all contingencies\", including the need to take an equity stake in banks in severe trouble. They stressed that this was not an option currently being pursued.</p> <p>Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, said \"extraordinary market conditions\" had forced Threadneedle Street to heed calls from banks to ease pressures in the money markets. The cost of three-month borrowing for banks reached 6.27% this week - higher than when the credit crunch began in August last year. Banks' reluctance to lend to each other had resulted in problems for companies seeking to raise money.</p> <p>The Bank will now accept a wider range of collateral from banks in exchange for \u00a340bn in fresh funds aimed at helping businesses keep operating in the economic downturn. The government is concerned that the dearth of loans for big business will intensify the downturn, with evidence this week that investors no longer want to own corporate debt and are instead seeking the safe haven of government bonds. As a result, the authorities were yesterday forced to release more gilts into the market.</p> <p>The flurry of announcements came as the latest snapshot of the service sector yesterday showed the weakest performance in at least 12 years and led to forecasts of a cut in interest rates on Thursday.</p> <p>The Bank released figures showing that far from withdrawing equity from their homes, consumers were responding to the plunge in the property market by paying back money to lenders - the first time this has occurred in 10 years. The investment bank Credit Suisse said 540 mortgage products had been pulled from the market this week alone largely as a result of the nationalisation on Monday of the buy-to-let lender Bradford &amp; Bingley. It warned of \"continued restrictive lending practices\" from mortgage lenders.</p> <p>Nick Parsons, head of analysis at NAB Capital, said: \"The economic news has been dire this week and will get worse. There is no prospect of any improvement in the economic data between now and Easter, let alone Christmas, apart from the fact that inflation will be coming down.\"</p> <p>King, who until recently opposed easier borrowing terms for banks, said Threadneedle Street would \"take all actions necessary to ensure that the banking system has access to sufficient liquidity\".</p> <p>The banks have been lobbying hard for action to end the paralysis in the money markets and this week lobbied Alistair Darling. Bank sources said conditions in the markets had changed dramatically since the collapse of Lehman Brothers three weeks ago and the Bank was responding to the \"dislocation\".</p> <p>Yesterday's increase in the guarantee for savings was rushed in by the FSA after the decision by Ireland on Monday to offer total security to customers of its banks for two years. </p> <p>A similar pledge in the UK would cost \u00a39tn and is considered unfeasible given London's position as an international financial centre. But by hinting that \u00a350,000 may not be enough to restore confidence in the system, the authorities were again trying to show that they will consider all steps to tackle the crisis.</p> <p>The FSA is also considering whether to amend the complex system which means the compensation limit may apply to accounts held in several banks which are owned by one group.</p>",
  "<h2>Jon Henley</h2> <p>I don't know where she is now, Lorna Sanders, or what she's doing, but it's fair to say that without her, this whole relationship would never have got off the ground. \"You were,\" says my mum, whose memories of the occasion are somewhat sharper than my own, \"three days old. Lorna was a member of the Pinner Occasional Players, of which your father was at that time one of the leading lights. She was your first visitor. He was your first gift.\"</p> <p>I can't imagine I took much notice of Blue Ted when he first arrived. I take my mother's word for it that he was an unusually handsome bear, beady-eyed, solidly stuffed, and - as the name might imply - bright blue. But as a host of other rivals for my affections gradually appeared on the scene, I religiously spurned them all, until by the time I was walking, Blue Ted and I were, indisputably, an item. </p> <p>There exists an embarrassing series of black-and-white photographs of me gambolling in a park in about 1962, Blue Ted clamped firmly under one arm as if no force on earth could ever pry him loose. \"You were absolutely inseparable,\" says Mum. \"You carried him everywhere. Along with an empty jar of Marmite. You loved that, too. You wouldn't go anywhere without them.\"</p> <p>We've had our ups and downs since those heady early days, Blue Ted and I, as is the nature of all relationships. Our moments of complicity, and of seeming indifference. For some time, I'm told, a small plastic tortoise supplanted him in my heart and hot little hand, followed by a succession of Dinky and Corgi toys (including that gold Aston Martin DB5 with the pop-out machine guns, spring-up bullet-proof rear window shield and ejector seat).</p> <p>But Blue Ted must have been special. You only have to look at him now - limp, threadbare, battered, darned, the stuffing literally knocked right out of him, to see how much he must have been hugged. The spark went out of our physical relations, I would imagine, some time in the mid-60s, but Blue Ted continued to sit somewhere in my bedroom throughout my childhood and adolescence, a largely forgotten but still comforting presence amid the hormonal turmoil. An emblem of innocence, perhaps, as I set resolutely about the business of losing mine. </p> <p>We grew ever more distant with adulthood. Still, Blue Ted came with me - albeit, as far as I can remember, in a shoebox - to university. He accompanied me on a 20-year European tour that took in Amsterdam, Helsinki and Paris. Intriguingly, around the time I had children of my own, he seems to have emerged from his hibernation. In fact he's lying in a corner of the bedroom now, though not so as anyone would ever notice him. </p> <p>I haven't a clue what all this says about me, of course; this must be the first time I've consciously devoted more than about two seconds' thought to the scraggy old bugger in about 45 years. But Blue Ted is the only object from my earliest childhood that I still possess. He's still there, and that is, undeniably, a thought that kind of pleases me. So, um, thanks, Lorna. </p> <h2>William Leith</h2> <p>When I was asked if I had a childhood teddy bear, I began to feel distinctly odd. Well, yes, I did have a teddy bear. And this bear was in a cupboard in my house. On a shelf, actually, behind some bags of stuff that I want to sort through, but never do. I knew where the bear was. I had not thrown the bear away. But it was definitely out of sight, and when somebody asked me about the bear, I felt very slightly queasy.</p> <p>What was the bear called? I also felt strange thinking about this. The bear was - or, rather, had been - called Ted. For a while, after my little brother got a smaller bear, my bear was Big Ted, and my brother's was Little Ted. At primary school, my brother was asked to write a story about his teddy bear. This story, it turned out, was some of the most potent ammunition I ever had in my armoury. Just mentioning it - or, in the end, anything to do with it - would draw unimaginable amounts of shame and embarrassment. </p> <p>\"Hey, what was that you wrote about your teddy bear?\"</p> <p>And: \"Don't worry, mate - there's nothing weird or strange about a guy who writes about his teddy bear.\"</p> <p>And: \"If you feel that strongly about it.\"</p> <p>And: \"No, I'm just saying.\"</p> <p>And: \"Ow!\"</p> <p>And: \"Mum, he's out of control!\"</p> <p>And now it's my turn, I suppose. It's all because of Sebastian Flyte and his bear in Brideshead Revisited. Now, I do have a theory about this. But first: taking your teddy bear to university? Dear me. I wouldn't have even taken mine to school. I slept in a dormitory with loads of other boys and a bear would have signalled vulnerability. A bear would have been a sign saying \"hit me\". Anyway, Flyte's bear was Evelyn Waugh's symbolism at work. Flyte would not let go of his bear because he did not want to let go of his childhood; he was the aristocracy on its last legs, not wanting the future to happen.</p> <p>So: my bear. It was given to my mother, by the members of a class she was teaching, when she went on maternity leave. It's a nice story. I've heard it told many times. It's the sort of story that gets told again and again - the sort of heart-warming story that, somehow, becomes hard to listen to. I heard it again, quite recently, after I had had my son. The bear resurfaced. My mother suggested that I give it to my son. I felt conflicted. Why? I'm sure a psychiatrist could unravel the whole thing - the fact that I hate, and yet am drawn to, sentimentality, my relationships with the bear, the dormitory, my empty bedroom with the bear in it, and so on.</p> <p>So I gave the bear to my son. I said, \"Do you want it?\"</p> <p>\"No,\" he said. \"I want the other bears.\"</p> <p>\"Right,\" I said, relieved. That's when I put the bear in the cupboard.</p> <h2>Andrew Martin </h2> <p>I can't remember when or where I came by The Panda. I've just always had him. I never went so far as to name him, but a strong bond was formed between us when he survived a terrible attack.</p> <p>When I was a boy, it was the task of whoever made my bed (which was certainly not me) to prop The Panda on top of the pillows. One day, when I was nine, a friend of mine - a rather rough friend - came up into my bedroom. The first thing he did was to pick my goldfish out of its bowl, saying he wanted to \"stroke\" him. Lobbing the fish back into the water, he then turned his attentions towards my bed, and a moment later he was holding The Panda in one hand and a purple marker pen, snatched from my desk, in the other. As I hurled myself at him, he scrawled a drawing of a stick man on The Panda's chest, which was at that time coloured white. </p> <p>It was class war. I was being punished for a) having a panda and b) having a desk, with pens neatly arrayed. I was angry rather than upset at this, but when I saw that my mother was upset, I became likewise. It was impossible to clean off the drawing; I would have to banish The Panda, otherwise I would be reminded of his assailant every time I looked at him. But then my mother set about sowing a black patch over The Panda's white chest. The sheer brilliance of this solution left me stunned: the only requirement of a panda was that it be black and white; it didn't matter which bits were black or white.</p> <p>I also had a golliwog (but we won't talk about him), and a long-snouted Clanger that was made of an old brown sock, as indeed, as far as I could see, were the ones in the animated television series that popularised these creatures. This pair fell by the wayside during my itinerant 20s, but I've always found house room for The Panda in memory of my mother, who died about a year after performing that rescue operation.</p> <p>The Panda is accommodated in my youngest son's bedroom, where for years he's been kept out of the fray, sitting on top of a bookshelf. My son, a dutiful host but not emotionally involved, recently reported that The Panda's black patch is beginning to come off, and I'm still furious when I peek at the stick man lurking underneath. I will not let the patch fall off entirely and, since it sends all the wrong signals for a man to ask his wife to repair his teddy bear, I suppose I will have to sew it back on myself.</p> <p>\u2022 How To Get Things Really Flat: A Man's Guide to Ironing, Dusting and Other Household Arts by Andrew Martin is published this week by Short Books, priced \u00a312.99</p> <h2>Guy Browning</h2> <p>We call them cuddlies in our house. I believe the proper word for them is familiars but to my mind that doesn't really communicate our intense feelings for them. We have five cuddlies in our household. My wife has a panda called Nosewhiskers, a name that may sound cute when you're a child but begins to sound quite unpleasant when you're a middle-aged man. My eldest daughter has a sleepy rabbit called Snoozly, my eldest son a dog called Dougie and my youngest son a rabbit with unusually erect ears called Real Rabbit. It's called that because one night, when we'd searched for him for about 17 hours, we tried to palm our son off with another similar rabbit with floppy ears. He knew immediately that this was an imposter, and when we eventually found the genuine article (stuffed in the back of a lorry like an illegal immigrant rabbit) he became Real Rabbit so we wouldn't be confused in future. </p> <p>My cuddly is a donkey called Burro. He's from El Salvador, which is where I was when I was a baby and in need of something cuddly to alleviate possible home sickness. Sadly, cuddly toys didn't exist in El Salvador in those days, and the closest thing to it was Burro, a rather touristy donkey sold in airports to desperate business travellers wanting last-minute gifts for home. Without wishing to be in any way disloyal, Burro is not cuddly. As he is made out of some kind of industrial-strength sacking material, I would have to say that he is actually quite rough. </p> <p>In his defence, Burro is a donkey and is therefore a hardworking beast of burden. Although he wasn't terribly good in the cuddling department, he did have saddlebags on either side of his sturdy little body. In these bags you could stow things of vital importance to a young boy, principally pieces of biscuit and the key to my secret treasure chest. In the treasure chest were things of absolutely vitally vital importance, such as Opal Fruits. </p> <p>A brilliant design feature on Burro is that you could adjust the whites of his eyes. If you rotate them to the top of his eyes he looks rather happy, as if you'd just relieved him of a great burden. My favourite position is one eye up and one eye down, which makes little Burro look like the Mad Donkey of the Pampas. </p> <p>The other good thing about Burro is that he stood on his own four legs. This means he is rubbish in bed because he won't lie down, but it does mean he can tirelessly stand guard on my bedside table. One of the reasons I still have Burro is because he isn't very cuddly, so, like a prickly old aunt, he suffered very little in the way of emotional wear and tear. He still stands guard with his mad eyes and I find that comfortingly familiar. </p> <h2>Oliver James</h2> <p>Whether I chose Koaly, my koala, I do not know. I suspect that he (for it is a he, I feel sure, absence of genitalia notwithstanding) was a present from a relative at a loss for something better to give. </p> <p>I think his principal role for me was as a mummy substitute. I can distinctly recall clinging on to him and feeling safer as a result. This is interesting in theoretical and personal terms.</p> <p>Both my parents were psychoanalysts who were quite close friends with Donald Winnicott, the creator of the concept of the transitional object. By this he meant the infant or toddler's \"first possession\", an object that could be experienced at times as being part of me; at others, not part of me. He maintained that it was able to occupy the space between me and not-me where play occurs, where we are neither trying to impose ourselves on our environment, nor being dictated by it. Play is not goal-directed or purposeful, not about trying to fulfil an instinct, as in sexual intercourse (versus flirting). Rather, like much of art or sport or fun, it is done for its own sake. </p> <p>Winnicott argued that infants do not start life with very clear boundaries between inner and outer. They use transitional objects to play with this distinction, so that if you observe infants with their object they will sometimes treat it as a separate entity to be bossed about or stroked, and sometimes cling to it, as part of themselves.</p> <p>One of Winnicott's key points was that the transitional object is not a mummy substitute or what his contemporary, John Bowlby, would have called an attachment figure. That is why I find it interesting to reflect that my Koaly was both a transitional object and could stand in for my mum. While I definitely played with him (probably incredibly violent games in which he destroyed other soft toys), he was also my safe haven when the ghouls and wolves gathered after the lights went out.</p> <p>As the third of four children under five, I definitely needed something. My mum was run off her feet, having had a pretty tricky childhood herself. Now a parent myself, I can see all too clearly how helpful soft toys are for keeping wolves at the door as well as for helping us to enter imaginary worlds. </p> <p>\u2022 See <a href=\"http://www.selfishcapitalist.com\">selfishcapitalist.com</a> for Oliver James's writings and broadcasting</p> <h2>Will Self</h2> <p>My children ask me about the toys I had when I was a child all the time - the subject fascinates them. They never tire of hearing about the Secret Sam briefcase, complete with automatic pistol, and the Moon Probe (I was eight in 1969 and moon toys were in vogue). But these hi-tech toys, while lusted after, were never much played with. </p> <p>What I tend to be a little quieter about - at least with the boys - is the extent to which I adored cuddly toys. I had bears I hung on to until they rotted and the amount of imaginative effort I put into giving them interior lives far surpasses anything I've ever done with the characters in my books. </p> <p>There were glove puppets that wouldn't leave my hand for weeks at a time, as they developed sinister sub-personalities of their own. </p> <p>I do 'fess up to the cuddly toys with my daughter - since she's had the same passion. Together we've visited \"bear factories\", and acquired bears you can put in the microwave and ones that have artificial voice boxes on which you can record your own voice (her bear speaks in my angry tones, saying, \"Buck up, Maddie!\"); but while I've brought her bears back from as far afield as Los Angeles and Lima, the sad fact is that she - unlike me - has outgrown them. There they sit, abandoned in her bedroom, and if it wasn't for me going in from time to time to give them a cuddle, I think they might pine away altogether.</p> <p>\u2022 Liver, by Will Self, is published by Viking at \u00a318.99</p> <p>\u2022 Brideshead Revisited (12A) is now on general release</p>",
  "<p>The thing about Dr Stephen Briers, a child psychologist, is that he really wants us to become child psychologists too. \"It's not a mystical art,\" he says. \"A lot of people could have a stab at it.\" Moreover, it's important we have a go, he says, and not just because the statistics are so alarming - 10% of children under the age of 16 have a diagnosable mental health disorder. Rather, psychology is the key to good parenting. That is why he's written Superpowers for Parents: The Psychology of Great Parenting and Happy Children, a handy guide to therapy techniques. If you understand your children and, most importantly, if your children understand themselves, they will grow up to be happy, well-adjusted adults, says Briers. \"We've got very obsessed with the idea that the hallmark of excellent parenting is to have immaculately behaved children,\" he says. \"We've forgotten that one of the points of being a parent is to try and equip your children for life and give them the skills they need.\" </p> <p>Aimed at parents with children of any age, his book tells you how to become an \"emotional coach\" and not let sentences such as \"Because I say so, that's why,\" fall from your lips. It advises you to draw stick figures with thought bubbles to show the connection between thought and feelings and tells you what to do if your child has a 3am freak out about their piano exam. (Probe their anxiety about failure with questions such as \"What would be the worst thing about that?\") But best of all it doesn't mention the naughty step. Or not much. Because if you use Briers' techniques, the need for the naughty step won't arise in the first place. </p> <p>Briers, 43, lives in Brighton with his wife, Melanie, a former midwife and now school nurse, and his two sons, aged 12 and eight. An English and theology graduate from Cambridge University, Briers came to mental health via a PhD in the sociology of religion. He now works for a private practice in Brighton doing a mixture of clinical work with children and adults and \"dabbles\" in the media. \"I want to shift the parenting agenda away from control,\" he says, firing a broadside against Gina Ford, the author of childcare books based on strict routine. \"We are very influenced by the behaviourist tradition,\" he explains. This is the theory that goes back to the 1930s and John Watson, the American baby expert who believed that parents should break the spirit of their infants in the same way trainers tame a horse. Claire Verity's series Bringing Up Baby for Channel 4, with her ration of 10 minutes of cuddling per day, followed the same model. \"The idea is that by reinforcing behaviours you want and producing an aversive condition in response to behaviour you don't want (the naughty step), you shape what happens.\" Behaviourism has a place, he says, \"but I think there's a lot more to children than that, and more to parenting, too\". </p> <p>Briers' priority is \"emotional intelligence\": \"Children who are emotionally literate, who demonstrate a high capacity for empathy and have social problem-solving skills, tend to be protected from all manner of mental health problems,\" he says. Moreover, he believes that emotional intelligence isn't only the key to future happiness, it's as important as intellectual attainment. So a parent's job isn't just to teach children how to say \"please\" and \"thank you\", and to know their multiplication tables, they must also expand their child's emotional vocabulary. \"Read to your child and discuss how characters might be feeling,\" says Briers. \"Do you think he's feeling scared/cross/happy/upset?\" He also recommends that parents teach their children about famously altruistic people such as Mother Teresa and Martin Luther King and ensure they become proficient at interpreting body language. It's all fascinating, not least because it all goes against our buttoned-up national psyche. But isn't it all a bit wet? \"It is very un-British,\" Briers admits. \"The danger is that because of that stereotype, people see the opposite as being rather touchy-feely, liberal wishy-washy,\" he says. \"The irony is that if you have an emotionally literate, skilled child they are much less likely to get beaten up in the playground and have problems. </p> <p>\"To be a kind person doesn't mean you have to be a pushover and if we think about what we actually value in people we love, it's not normally their incomes or their IQs.\"</p> <p>The purpose of getting your child to be more in touch with their emotions (and those of others) is to help them manage them. Briers takes the view (as do those who subscribe to this cognitive behavioural approach) that there is a connection between thoughts, feelings and behaviour. \"Scratch below the surface of a badly behaved child's defiance and we probably find ... a soul in some degree of torment,\" he writes. \"Behaviour will at some level be a communication,\" he explains, \"it has meaning, it has context.\" A parent's job is to show the child how to join the dots. \"How you interpret a situation is going to determine how you feel about it and what you do about it,\" he explains. </p> <p>Shakespeare subscribed to something similar: \"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so\" (Hamlet, act II, scene II). And pointing out unhelpful ways of thinking -\"think traps\", says Briers - is something you can teach children from a young age. For instance, next time your child gets something wrong in class and comes home saying, \"I've made a complete fool of myself. I won't ever be able to show my face in there again ...\" you'll be able to point out that she is \"catastrophising\" - assuming the worst and seeing the consequences as more terrible than they need be. </p> <p>But helping your child to maintain healthy mental habits is a rather long-winded process, not least because it involves asking so many questions, such as \"Why do you think ...?\" and \"How did that make you/him feel?\" Do we have time for this? \"This is about developing a different kind of relationship with your child that is integrated into your daily interactions,\" says Briers. \"If we don't invest the time and energy we have only ourselves to blame if we produce a generation of children who are struggling and prone to problems.\" </p> <p>In fact, he says, if there's one thing we can all do to make a difference, it's to listen. \"Spending time really listening to children helps develop their capacity for empathy, makes them feel contained and supported and puts them in a good place.\" In the book, Briers even gives tips on how to be a good listener: \"Maintain a good level of eye contact - usually a third of the time, as a rough guide.\" </p> <p>Showing attentiveness bordering on suffocation isn't the answer. Neither is \"blanket praise\", telling your children you love every painting they have ever done. \"Praise can easily become devalued if children just feel you are paying lip-service,\" Briers warns. Be specific: \"I love the way you made that girl look as though she's running.\"</p> <p>Clearly, it's all a fine balancing act. Not least in the way you approach meaningful conversations in the first place. Leaning forward and saying, \"So, tell me how you feel,\" will make a child recoil. \"The emphasis needs to be on making these conversations spontaneous,\" says Briers, who often talks to his younger son when he's putting him to bed, whereas his older son is happier to chat over the crossword. </p> <p>Briers' methods also expect high levels of self-control from parents. \"Children will take their cues as much from what they observe in your behaviour as from the content of your words,\" he cautions. This requires you not to yell at your child to calm down when you are evidently not calm yourself. As a result, says Briers, you should probably be the one who goes to your room and only come back when you're feeling better. </p> <p>But there is something else eating at Briers. One gets the sense that he is not a big fan of the modern world. Behind his enthusiasm for stamp collecting (encourages absorption and focus) and assembling a special box of treasures, plus his horrified acknowledgement that growing numbers of children just want to be celebrities, there is another subject skulking away: \"The pace of life is phenomenally fast and children now have many opportunities for rapid gratification through computer games. My instincts tell me that our environment a few decades ago, when there were fewer distractions, less stimulus, required people to develop a different consciousness and I suspect there was something a lot healthier about that.\" </p> <p>Moreover, Briers may be the first psychologist in a long while whose aim is to write himself out of a job. What happens if parents become so expert they no longer need him? \"Frankly, who cares,\" he says. \"If psychologists become redundant that is an index of positive social change and I would be very happy to retrain as a carpenter.\" </p> <p>\u2022 Superpowers for Parents: The Psychology of Great Parenting and Happy Children by Stephen Briers is published by Prentice Hall Life, \u00a39.99</p>",
  "<p>I first saw Liverpool from the middle seat of a tandem in 1950. An eccentric way to approach the city even then, but every Sunday if the weather looked fine my parents would take the tandem from its shed at our home 30 miles to the east across Lancashire and we'd set off, with my older brother on his bike acting as an outrider. I remember green tramcars grinding smoothly through Liverpool's suburbs, my father shouting to my brother to watch out for his front wheel in the tramlines, and then sitting on a Mersey ferry where seagulls perched on the rail and I had a coughing fit because some crumbs from a roast beef sandwich had stuck in my throat. </p> <p>A whole day's excursion preserved in two scenes. Was there talk of Liverpool's bomb damage? Probably. Did we see ships? Certainly. But the grand narrative of the day has been lost. Departure, interesting incident, arrival, return: to make the picture more complete all these would need to draw on memories of other days out, or be invented. </p> <p>This is what fiction usually does. One of the persuasive hallmarks of Terence Davies's films is that they recreate childhood as adults remember it, as sweet and occasionally sour fragments of a departed life. His best known, Distant Voices, Still Lives, evoked his own boyhood in Liverpool as the youngest in a working-class Catholic family of 10 children. It was made in 1988 and won all kinds of awards including the International Critics Prize at Cannes. But Davies made only three feature-length films in the subsequent 20 years. He became a \"whatever-happened-to?\" conversation piece rather than a working director, until this year, when Of Time and the City, his first film in eight years, was shown at Cannes. It was hailed as a great work of cinema, it made people cry, and it has re-established Davies's reputation as one of the handful of British directors with a singular and easily recognisable vision, in other words an auteur. From October 31 it can be seen at art-house screens all over the country. </p> <p>It will be a success, perhaps even a small commercial triumph if audiences heed critics as they once did. Few people could have expected this. The film was made on a budget of \u00a3250,000, pulled together from various sources and dispensed by a committee organised under the flag of Liverpool's year as European City of Culture. Its description as \"a documentary about Liverpool\" hardly guarantees crowds beyond the city. To say that it re-creates an epoch of British history gets us nowhere at all, because that's what the British film and television industry does again and again. What makes Of Time and the City spectacularly different is the way it makes beauty out of our everyday pasts, so that what could have been easily been nostalgia or comedy or social history becomes an elegy for the way so much of Britain - not just Liverpool - was to our parents or ourselves. </p> <p>In one way, its approach is as old as the British documentary movement itself: cinematic poems to working-class life began in the 1930s, and Davies credits Humphrey Jennings' wartime Listen to Britain as a particular inspiration. But Davies shot only a small proportion of his film - the scenes of modern Liverpool. Visually, it mainly represents a triumph of editing other people's work made over the past 60 years in streets, docksides, restaurants, trains. </p> <p>Aurally, in its music and Davies's words, it rejects all the recent conventions that have governed how northern England is seen. </p> <p>Once industrial cities have ceased to be generally important to the world - once their old purpose has gone - they often survive as a self-conscious parody; a two-dimensional cut-out assembled from football scarves, an intensified devotion to the local accent, cultural strategies and heritage trails, all in the name of identity and difference, and with an eye to tourism. In Newcastle upon Tyne, big men in black and white shirts sit in the stadium to tell us they are Geordies; in Liverpool, You'll Never Walk Alone, professional Scousers, The Beatles. From the moment Davies begins to read his script, you understand that these crude encapsulations are to be broken. He sounds like dons and actors used to sound - a grave voice, sometimes sardonic and at other times theatrical with loss. No trace of accent, other than RP. How could a poor little Liverpudlian grow up to sound like this? Soon, the question is shaming. How far are we imprisoned by modish ideas of \"identity\" even to ask it? </p> <p>Then there are the words. A good deal of uncredited TS Eliot - mainly drawn from the Four Quartets and matched to pictures of all kinds of unlikely things, such as the Liverpool Overhead Railway and tugboats. But not only Eliot. Many half-remembered verses by other poets and from the Bible in a script cut and mixed as sharply as the footage it accompanies. Over modern scenes of girls lurching about outside a bar, Davies reads Walter Raleigh rather savagely: \"Thy gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of roses/Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies/ Soon break, soon wither - soon forgotten/In folly ripe, in reason rotten.\"</p> <p>Not least, there is the music. Davies, who left school at 16, was working as a young shipping clerk when The Beatles began. He devotes only a few seconds to them, mourning the departure of the '\"witty lyric and the well-crafted love song\" as he turns instead to Sibelius, Bruckner and '\"every over-wrought note\" of Mahler. Great music can give almost any scene the pathos or majesty that intrinsically it may not deserve - Woody Allen called it \"borrowed grandeur\" - but Davies often uses it to forgivable effect. To an aria by the Romanian composer Popescu Branesti, he cuts nearly 20 scenes of domestic life in the terraced streets of 1940s Liverpool. A boy delivers milk on a bike; a woman lights a coal fire; a girl combs her hair; a man shaves; a housewife scrubs her front step; children rush towards a playground maypole ... and all these small acts are invested with a dignity that honours the people who performed them. </p> <p>The mood changes with the coming of the municipal tower block and the dole. \"We had hoped for paradise,\" Davies says. \"We got the anus mundi.\" And then it changes again with the present, where floodlights play on the Liver Building and deconsecrated churches have been made into restaurants \"as chic as anything abroad\". He wonders, \"Is this happiness? Is this perfection?\"- questions that will now need to be supplemented with \"And in any case, how is it afforded and how long can it last?\" </p> <p>It isn't a perfect film. It declines, I think, whenever the lens leaves Liverpool. Scenes from the Korean war are matched heavy handedly (and given Davies's tastes, peculiarly) with The Hollies and \"He's not heavy, he's my brother.\" The Queen Elizabeth's coronation prompts some political sentiment about rich and poor, but when Davis calls it \"the Betty Windsor show\" it could be Kenneth Williams having a try at republicanism. Williams was one of Davies's heroes, when, as a boy filled with homosexual longing, he turned on a radio \"as small and brown as Hovis\" to hear all that Julian and Sandy palaver on Round the Horne. </p> <p>But if these are flaws, they should be forgiven. Davies has elevated the common British working-class experience out of folksiness, sociological inquiry and football and given it a proper send-off with TS Eliot, Mahler and all. It became history in my lifetime. Watching the film, seeing from above crowds pour off the ferries like purposeful black insects, it was strange to think that as a small boy, the same age as Davies, I had been part of all this one Sunday, before we turned the bikes round for home.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown is good at shock, if not awe. What a coup de theatre! Bringing back Mandelson is his Sarah Palin moment, or maybe a reprise of his Digby Jones moment of madness: now he is swapping his goats - government of all the talents - for the old goats, with Lord Mandelson in ermine, Nick Brown as chief whip (again) and Margaret Beckett back from retirement.</p> <p>Brown gets 10 out of 10 for astonishing the headline writers, but few points for renewed sense of political direction or purpose. It's back, not forward, zigzagging to nowhere much. When lost for ideas, let's replay the glory days - never mind the utterly changed political landscape. This is a 1997 tribute band, out of tune with these transformed times. Mandelson's famous praise for the \"filthy rich\" couldn't strike a worse note now. Does he know other songs? We shall see.</p> <p>Here is a government already suffering an inability to reinvent itself. The one chance Labour had for renewal was when Brown promised change 27 times in one speech, but never delivered. The promised ring-binder of new ideas he had brooded over all these years never existed. Ten years in the Treasury dulled the senses and taught only excessive caution. Instead of change, here he is, heading back to the tropes of 1997, which were, in truth, a bit dog-eared even then, forged in 1994. </p> <p>The Progress group, founded by Mandelson, keeps nostalgically rewriting 1997, the Milburns and the Clarkes calling for more outdated government-shrinking \"reform\", privatisings, co-payments and outsourcings at a time when the importance of government has never been more evident. They conveniently forget that the 1997 manifesto was also more radical than anything Labour dares do now. A \u00a35bn windfall on utilities? A minimum wage in the teeth of the CBI's direst warnings? Will Mandelson defy them now? Fresh thinkers are needed, not the stuckists of more than a decade ago steeped in market idolatry.</p> <p>There were rumours Jon Cruddas would be brought in as housing minister. Wisely, when sounded out, he backed off, unwilling to be a neutered trophy goat. He has been protesting that when 250,000 new homes are needed just to keep up each year, only 75,000 will be built this year and fewer next, with a 5m shortage by 2015. If banks need bailing out, so councils need money to buy every repossessed home to stop yet more homelessness - and money to build and build throughout a recession. Cruddas was not willing to take responsibility without power, but Beckett will rock no boats.</p> <p>While reshuffle showmanship stole the limelight, out in the real world the banks teetered on the very edge again. The Bank of England's governor was forced against all his instincts to pour shedloads more cash into bank loans, with much more to flow. We are witnessing in Robert Peston's words, \"nationalisation of the banks by stealth\". The firestorm rages, and wise heads say we have seen little yet of the hard times to come. Not just stockmarkets, pensions, retail, and housebuilders, but other sectors are now hit. Housing associations are in crisis, their financial calculations awry. The voluntary sector has been hit as donations have dried up, down by a third even before many pockets are badly hit yet: just one example is hospices, which draw two-thirds of their income from legacies and bequeathed homes. Full ramifications everywhere are beginning to dawn, and this is when unemployment is only just starting to rise.</p> <p>\"Don't panic!\" is the necessary message from any government, but the cabinet are prone to believe their own reassurances. Boasting that the storm would pass us over, and we'd be shielded from a bump no worse than dotcom was plain wrong, alas. Politically, Labour seems still unprepared for seismic shifts in action. Where is the plan? How do we adapt? There is no big picture to help voters understand what's happening, or what has to be done from now on and why. Both the Brown and Cameron conference speeches will be looked back on as notably failing to grasp this turning of the tides - no Roosevelt, they.</p> <p>If lacking grand strategy, still Brown and Darling have learned to man the fire extinguishers competently. The Guardian's ICM poll today shows 55% of voters think Brown has handled crisis well. Bad times prove good for him, rescued by flood, terror attacks and now the great bank crash. However, Cameron's team still scores higher on trust to get through this crisis. One of Cameron's more deadly jibes may stick: \"We have experienced his experience\". </p> <p>The Tories' post-conference boost puts them back 12 points ahead, enough to win with a 60-seat majority. Voters are still less likely to give Labour a fourth win now than when Blair was turfed out for dropping to 32%. But Labour is closing in: there was a 20% gap in June. It can only hope that as the crisis continues, so will the gap narrow. However, as recession or even depression drags on through next year, it's unclear if Labour will be seen as saviour or villain. The global tendency is to blame governments.</p> <p>As for the \"all hands on deck\" reshuffle, don't hold your breath for harmony. Nick Brown, one of team Brown's rottweilers, has been re-elevated to chief whip, though another beast, Damian McBride has been removed: the poison briefings, leakings and threats of tabloid exposure that have been a Brown regime hallmark will not abate. Nor will the cabinet be a poison-free zone, with many scarred by Mandelson's lasceratingly arrogant tongue. Fascinating and dangerous, he risks casting greyer colleagues into the shadows. Has this bought Blairite loyalty? No leader commands loyalty if they still look like losing the next election badly. </p> <p>This week Cameron revealed his classic Conservative core. Though more eloquently framed, his policies are print-outs of his predecessors' manifestos. Stripped of his green, compassionate disguise, here was duller dress in an all-too-familiar blue. While Tories promise council and corporation tax cuts, Labour ideas should own these political times - but not with the mantras of 1997. It's never too late: ministers' conference speeches were good reminders of their best progressive programmes. If Mandelson's return reminds how much radicalism was stamped out of New Labour at birth, the hurricane of current events may yet force Labour into new directions.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Every morning I click on <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/TheNote/story?id=156238\">ABC's The Note</a> for a near-killer dose of right-leaning conventional political wisdom written with enough cutesy faux-clever asides to choke a horny corndog, or something. In any case, here's what I learned <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=3105288\">this morning</a> about last night's vice-presidential debate:</p> <blockquote> <p>Take that, Tina Fey: You betcha Gov Sarah Palin is back - darn right (wink) - and it might matter yet. She may not have been a clear winner Thursday night, but the McCain ticket has got a different story to shout out on Friday - even if all Palin did was square-dance over the bar she had lowered herself. She did more than that, actually, and that gives Sen John McCain the narrowest of openings.</p> </blockquote> <p>I don't mean to pick on The Note in particular. It's just that every so often I imagine trying to explain our country to a proverbial Martian or some genius with a time machine from another century, and I say: \"Yes, believe it or not, these are the criteria our gatekeepers employ to give people the knowledge to pick the people who will plan our wars, manage our economy, protect our ecosystem and if they deem it necessary, begin a nuclear war.\"</p> <p>I'll admit it: That Palin woman is awfully cute. I don't think I'm going too far out on a limb by arguing she's just about the cutest governor any state in America has ever had. Perky too. And while it could be annoying, the overall effect is actually quite enjoyable. She kind of reminds me of a grown-up <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Temple\">Shirley Temple</a>, who, we note, ran unsuccessfully for Congress against retired Korean war veteran Pete McCloskey in 1967. She ran on a platform supporting America's involvement in the Vietnam war and went on to hold several diplomatic posts, serving as the US delegate to many international conferences and summits and, eventually, US ambassador to Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>And if Czechoslovakia were still and existence and did not require much in the way of diplomatic expertise from its ambassador, I'd recommend Palin for that post in a minute. I was in a room of liberal fellow-travellers last night, and everybody kind of liked her. One person suggested she'd make a great press secretary for President Obama. I might be willing to go as far as UN representative, provided that she were joined by some Richard Holbrooke-type who would do the actual work.</p> <p>But vice-president to a 72-year-old man with a history of cancer who refuses to release his medical records? Are we insane? </p> <p>In a word, yes. Here's how The Note evaluates her qualifications:</p> <blockquote> <p>Maybe she doesn't want to talk more about global warming, or about what vice-presidents do, or about who's commanding US troops in Afghanistan. Perhaps she isn't entirely clear on where her running mate is on everything (it's only been, like, five weeks). Maybe (definitely) she really, really wants us to think she and McCain are \"mavericks.\" But Palin returned to the source of her popularity Thursday night at Washington University in St Louis - the folksy, aw-shucks, look-who's-running-for-vice-president appeal that reminds us that shortly before she was a drag on the ticket she was a phenom in her own right. </p> </blockquote> <p>Feel better now? Again, it's not The Note's fault. Everywhere you turn, the people paid to keep track of our political system devote themselves to exactly the same irrelevant, indeed, nonsensical criteria: </p> <p>\u2022 Palin was \"poised and confident, speaking colloquially in a way that could appeal to independents,\" <a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/politics/story/D798D030168942E5862574D700134895?OpenDocument\">Bill Lambrecht writes in the St Louis Post-Dispatch</a>. \"She was fluent, if not brilliant, on foreign policy. And even if she didn't actually answer some of moderator Gwen Ifill's questions, many voters may not have noticed and others probably won't hold it against her.\"</p> <p>\u2022 On style, <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/10/stephanopoulo-2.html\">ABC's George Stephanopoulos</a> gives Palin an A and Biden an A-. Both get Bs on accuracy. \"She beat expectations and she stopped the slide,\" Stephanopoulos said Friday on Good Morning America. \"I think the race probably solidified where it was. If you came in liking Biden, you voted for him [in post-debate polls] and if you liked McCain-Palin you probably voted for them. But that's the problem for the McCain campaign.\" </p> <p>\u2022 \"The pit bull is back, and she can still bite,\" write <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/10/02/2008-10-02_sarah_palin_didnt_lose_debate_debut_but_.html\">Michael Saul and David Saltonstall of the New York Daily News</a>. \"Palin spoke in mostly complete sentences, unlike her performance in a string of recent TV appearances.\" </p> <p>\u2022 \"The politics of spunk\", reads <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-assess3-2008oct03,0,2949181.story\">the Los Angeles Times headline</a>.

Wearing a glittery flag pin on her jacket, she blew a kiss toward the audience.

In polling by both CNN and CBS after the debate, all that ignorance mixed with spunkiness failed to impress. CBS had it 51-36 for Biden while CBS's undecided voters gave it to the Delware senator by a margin of 46-21. </p> <p>Having a debate - even a good one - I might add is a silly way to pick a president in the first place. You can make wise, prudent, well-informed, even bold decisions in the White House without having the qualities necessary to win one of these silly contests. But when the judges are giving you points for not spontaneously speaking in tongues - it is, again, hard to believe we are even serious about this election.</p> <p>Face it: Joe Biden is eminently qualified for the office he is seeking, and his views are deeply within the mainstream of American political discourse. Sarah Palin is not only nowhere near qualified, but she has to play all these games in order to hide her views, which, like those of George Bush, are those of the repudiated Republican right-wing. Perky or pesty, why do we need to discuss anything else?</p>",

  "<p>Gordon Brown has convened an economic war cabinet to bolster Britain against the increasingly turbulent conditions in world markets and appointed Paul Myners, chairman of Land Securities and Guardian Media Group, as City minister.</p> <p>\"Quite simply, the new era that we have entered requires new ways of governing,\" Brown explained of the creation of the National Economic Council (NEC). \"We don't just need to change policies to deal with the new financial difficulties but the way we take decisions, the way we govern, has got to change as well.\"</p> <p>The creation of the council is one of several changes wrought by Brown in order to deal with the fall-out from the past three weeks which have seen the world's credit markets seize up, investment banks collapse, the effective nationalisation of Bradford &amp; Bingley and the government forced to guarantee personal savings deposits of up to \u00a350,000 amid fears that even more high street banks could fail.</p> <p>The NEC was immediately branded by the City as an economic war cabinet. </p> <p>\"Call it what you will,\" Brown responded. \"The important thing to say is that we are taking all the action that is necessary and we will do whatever it takes to ensure not just the stability of the economy \u2026 but also that we get the economy onto a path of growth, where people can see we are being fair in the way we deliver prosperity for the future.\"</p> <p>\"These are new times. The global economy will never be the same again. Huge changes are taking place. We have to deal with it in a new way.\" </p> <p>Myners, who will be given a peerage in order to take up his post, will resign from his commercial posts - and even his post as chair of the trustees of the Tate gallery - and sell any shares he owns.</p> <p>He is not taking a salary from his new ministerial post and City sources estimate that he is giving up at least \u00a31m a year by resigning from his various corporate jobs. He is also losing more than \u00a33m worth of shares in hedge fund GLG, where he is currently a director, a post he will also quit.</p> <p>\"There is a serious job to be done,\" Myners said. \"And I look forward to working with the Chancellor but I have nothing else to say at this stage as my focus is getting to grips with my new job.\"</p> <p>He is allowed to retain his charity positions so he will remain a trustee of Glyndebourne and the Smith Institute, an independent think tank which looks at equality and enterprise. He will, however, hve to resign his chairmanship of the Low Pay Commission.</p> <p>The former Marks &amp; Spencer chairman will join the rest of the NEC at its first meeting on Monday morning after which Alistair Darling will make a statement to the House of Commons about the economic crisis.</p> <p>Also round the table will be the chancellor, the foreign secretary, David Miliband, new business secretary, Peter Mandelson and eight other Cabinet ministers, as well as new science minister Lord Drayson, and another new face, Stephen Carter.</p> <p>The former chief executive of Ofcom, who left the regulator to work at City PR firm Brunswick before joining Brown as his strategy chief, has been made junior minister for communications, technology and broadcasting. He will also receive a peerage.</p> <p>The NEC will coordinate \"efforts to help families deal with higher food and energy prices\", according to a statement, and \"provide the forum on how to equip the country for the future by making the right investments in education, skills, science and infrastructure\".</p> <p>The Council will also have responsibilities to promote the development of sustainable and secure energy supplies; to tackle barriers to entrepreneurship and small business growth; and to address the UK's housing and planning needs.</p> <p>Brown has also drafted in a legion of City grandees to act as business ambassadors who will promote UK trade overseas. The ambassadors are Barclays chairman Marcus Agius, Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Victor Blank, Vodafone's chairman and former HSBC boss Sir John Bond, former BP boss Lord John Browne, Sir Terence Conran, chairman of Standard Chartered bank Mervyn Davies, chairman of the London Stock Exchange Chris Gibson-Smith, UCL provost Malcolm Grant, Sainsbury's chairman Sir Philip Hampton, Oxford University vice-chancellor Dr John Hood, Lord Digby Jones, Anna Mann from MWM Consulting, BAE Systems chairman Dick Olver, Cambridge University vice-chancellor Professor Alison Richard, architect Lord Richard Rogers, chairman of Rio Tinto Paul Skinner and chief executive of GKN Sir Kevin Smith.</p>",
  "<p>Stephen Carter, the prime minister's strategy chief, has been appointed as a junior minister of communications, technology and broadcasting as part of today's cabinet reshuffle. </p> <p>Carter, a former chief executive of media regulator Ofcom and ad agency JWT, has also been given a peerage in order to take up his new role in the House of Lords.</p> <p>\"Given the global financial challenges, the communications sector has never been more important to our economy,\" said Carter. \"This role is an opportunity to make a contribution to the growth of this key sector, and I look forward to working closely with Peter Mandelson and Andy Burnham.\"</p> <p>His remit will be split between the department for culture, media and sport under secretary of state Andy Burnham, and Peter Mandelson at the department for business, enterprise and regulatory reform.</p> <p>Carter, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jan/08/uk.gordonbrown\">left his role as chief executive of PR agency Brunswick in January to join Downing Street</a>, had reportedly threatened to resign at the end of this year.

  "<p>Gordon Brown today explained his astonishing decision to bring his bitter rival Peter Mandelson back into the cabinet as business secretary, saying: \"Serious people are needed for serious times.\"</p> <p>At a press conference in Downing Street, the prime minister said he was appointing Mandelson, who in the past has twice resigned from cabinet posts in controversial circumstances, because he needed \"the best team\" to help Britain through the global economic crisis.</p> <p>Speaking before going into Downing Street this afternoon, Mandelson said that he had had his \"ups and downs\" with Brown but that he now got on \"fine\" with the prime minister. </p> <p>\"We have also known each other for 20 years and originally we worked very well together. I'm proud to have been invited to serve his government,\" Mandelson said. </p> <p>\"Our economy, like other other, is facing very hard challenges as a result of the global financial crisis and in a sense it's all hands to the deck. I will be working, along with the rest of the government, as hard as I can to protect our economy and pull us through it.\" </p> <p>Unveiling a series of changes to the structure of government, including the creation of a national economic council, Brown said that problems such as the credit crunch and rising food and fuel prices meant he \"wanted to reconstruct the way that we govern to meet these challenges\".</p> <p>As well as the return of Mandelson, Brown pointed to the appointment of senior business figures such as Lord Drayson, who is rejoining the government as science minister, and Paul Myners, the outgoing chairman of the Guardian Media Group who has become City minister, as evidence of the fact that he was compiling a heavyweight team.</p> <p>Some Labour figures welcomed the return of Mandelson, one of the key architects of New Labour. But leftwingers were horrified and the Tories condemned the appointment as a \"stunning failure of judgment\". </p> <p>Asked at the news conference why he was appointing Mandelson, Brown said: \"Serious people are needed for serious times. He has got unrivalled experience as trade commissioner of the European Commission. Everybody around the world has said that he's done a superb job.\"</p> <p>Brown went on: \"We are bringing together the best team possible to deal with the difficulties [that we face].\"</p> <p>In Brown's first major reshuffle as prime minister, Mandelson will replace John Hutton, who becomes defence secretary. Des Browne, who had combined defence with the post of Scottish secretary, is stepping down from the government.</p> <p>Geoff Hoon, the chief whip, is replacing Ruth Kelly as transport secretary. His job goes to Nick Brown, the deputy chief whip and a key ally of the prime minister's. </p> <p>Hilary Benn stays in the cabinet as environment secretary. But Ed Miliband, one of the prime minister's most trusted allies, is promoted to take charge of a new department for climate change and energy that will take some responsibilities from the environment department and some from the business department.</p> <p>Liam Byrne takes Miliband's old job at the Cabinet Office. He will attend cabinet meetings, but not as a full member. There is also a promotion for Jim Murphy, who will replace Browne as Scottish secretary.</p> <p>Murphy's post of Europe minister will be taken by Caroline Flint, who will attend cabinet meetings when Europe is on the agenda, but not as a full member. Margaret Beckett, the former foreign secretary, will rejoin the government as housing minister, replacing Flint. Like Byrne, she will attend cabinet meetings, but not as a full member.</p> <p>Tony McNulty, the policing minister, has been promoted to employment minister and Drayson, the former defence minister, rejoins the government as science minister. McNulty and Drayson will be cabinet attendees.</p> <p>Stephen Carter, Brown's chief of staff, and Myners are both joining the government as ministers in the Lords. Carter will be minister for communications, technology and broadcasting and Myners, who is stepping down from his Guardian post, will be City minister.</p> <p>Jan Royall, the chief whip in the Lords, will join the cabinet as leader of the Lords. She will replace Lady Ashton, who is leaving the government to replace Mandelson as the UK's commissioner in Brussels.</p> <p>Other cabinet ministers, including Alistair Darling, David Miliband, Ed Balls, James Purnell, Jacqui Smith and John Denham are staying in their current jobs.</p> <p>Brown will chair the new national economic council, which will have 10 other cabinet ministers and five junior ministers as members. It will meet twice a week, starting on Monday, to \"provide a new approach to coordinating economic policies across government\".</p> <p>Downing Street also announced the appointment of 17 \"business ambassadors\", including Sir Victor Blank, the chairman of Lloyds TSB, and Sir John Bond, the chairman of Vodafone, to support the work of the national economic council.</p> <p>Brown said: \"My sense is that in a few months' time all governments around the world will be taking similar action to the action that we are taking today.\"</p> <p>The reshuffle will also see Damian McBride, the prime minister's political spin doctor, moving into a backroom role. McBride, a former Treasury civil servant who became a partisan special adviser, is a key member of the Brown team, but he has also been increasingly criticised by Labour MPs who believe that Downing Street has been engaged in too much negative briefing.</p> <p>McBride's job as Brown's political press secretary is expected to be taken by Justin Forsyth, a special adviser working on international development issues in Downing Street. </p> <p>The appointment of Mandelson represents a bold gamble for Brown. Last year the new prime minister was applauded for inviting non-Labour figures into his \"government of all the talents\" and, given the longstanding nature of his feud with Mandelson, the move could quash claims that he is a factional politician incapable of working with others in the national interest.</p> <p>Mandelson is also credited, even by many of his enemies, with being an exceptionally able politician who is an expert at presentation \u2013 an area where Brown has been weak.</p> <p>But Mandelson is also a divisive figure who is unpopular within the Labour party and in the country at large. He also has many enemies in the media who resent the heavy-handed tactics he used when he was Labour's chief spin doctor in the late 1980s and 1990s. </p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, William Hague, said: \"In bringing back Peter Mandelson \u2013 the man who created Labour spin \u2013 [Brown] has broken his promise to govern in an honest and open way. You can only conclude that his appointment was designed to distract from the changes he should have made.<br> \"By leaving in place a chancellor who has failed and a foreign secretary who has undermined him at every opportunity Gordon Brown has also been exposed as weak. \"With this bizarre reshuffle the prime minister has achieved the impossible and made the government even more dysfunctional.\"</p> <p>John McDonnell, the leftwing Labour MP who stood unsuccessfully for the leadership last year, expressed alarm at the appointment. He said: \"The whole Labour movement will be utterly perplexed at what the prime minister's motives are.</p> <p>\"This is an extraordinary step backwards into the worst elements of the Blair era, to reinstate possibly the most divisive figure in Labour's recent history.\"</p> <p>But David Blunkett, the former home secretary, welcomed the move. \"It is a masterstroke in the sense that Peter was an excellent secretary of state for trade and industry but more importantly the connections he has built up as trade commissioner in Europe will be invaluable to the UK,\" Blunkett told Sky News.</p> <p>\"Of course it is a political stroke as well because it is inclusive and brings back someone who could be described as nothing else but an arch-Blairite.\"<br> Although Brown conducted a long-running feud with Mandelson \u2013 at one stage they were barely speaking to each other, although they were supposed to be jointly running Labour's election campaign \u2013 Brown has been trying to repair their relationship over the last few months.</p> <p>The pair have had a series of meetings and have often spoken on the phone.</p> <p>This is Mandelson's second return to government. The former Northern Ireland secretary and trade secretary previously resigned twice from the cabinet.</p> <p>Mandelson, who is a European commissioner and not currently an MP, is expected to be made a peer to enable him to rejoin the government.</p> <p>Derek Draper, a former adviser to Mandelson who has recently returned to work for the Labour party, said: \"I think Peter will prove to be a pretty formidable secretary of state, a really brilliant contributor to the strategy of the government and the presentation of the government and people will look at Peter and think: 'You know what, we misjudge Peter Mandelson sometimes,' and actually the strengths of Peter and the good side of Peter will come through now.</p> <p>\"As someone who knows him and has had my issues with him, I think he deserves this and I think he will prove to people why he deserves that place at the top table of British politics.\"</p> <p>Another former aide, <a href=\"http://wpbenjamin.livejournal.com/\">Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, wrote on his blog</a> that Mandelson was \"one of the few class acts in British politics\" and revealed that in recent months Brown has \"sought to re-establish his links with Peter through a series of strategy meetings and many phone calls\".</p> <p>But he added: \"It was a reflection on the prime minister's perilous position that he sought advice from someone who he pursued a vendetta against for more than a decade following his failure to replace John Smith as leader of the Labour party in 1994. In that time Gordon Brown's acolytes have held no one in greater contempt than Peter. Their reaction to this news, as with most things that they say to the press, is probably unprintable.\" </p> <p>The appointment of Mandelson will reassure those in the Labour party who have been worried about the Brown government becoming too factional. Last week Blairites were warning that making Nick Brown chief whip would cause a backlash, but with Mandelson back in government the Blairites will not be in a position to complain about their allies being sidelined.</p>",
  "<p>Despite further signs of just how bad the credit crunch has become, the stock market's mood has been surprisingly buoyant ahead of the crucial US vote on the $700bn banking bail out.</p> <p>The US non-farm payroll figures were worse than expected, but analysts said that merely put more pressure on congress to approve the banking rescue plan. News that Wells Fargo had stepped in to buy banking group Wachovia, trumping a previous agreement with Citigroup, also helped sentiment.</p> <p>By the time London closed, Wall Street was around 240 points higher, and the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 109.9 points up at 4980.3. So - in a week which started with Bradford &amp; Bingley being nationalised and US Congress initially rejecting the $700bn US deal and is ending with Gordon Brown calling for \"new ways of governing\" to cope with the financial crisis - the index is down a mere 100 points or so.</p> <p>But you do not need to look far to see several signs of just how serious the situation has become. These included the Financial Services Authority raising the deposit protection threshold to \u00a350,000 and the Bank of England suddenly <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/marketnotice081003.pdf\">deciding to accept</a> a wider range of collateral from stressed out banks in exchange for funding, including asset-backed securities backed by the likes of student loans, consumer loans, auto loans and equipment leases.</p> <p>Investors in banks decided to see all this as a positive sign. <strong>HBOS</strong> rose 30.4p to 200.5p, <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong> climbed 28.25p to 290.25p, <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> rose 10.2p to 186.2p and <strong>Barclays</strong> added 30p to 368p.</p> <p>But <strong>British Airways</strong> fell 12.7p to 165.4p after poor September passenger figures. Software group <strong>Autonomy</strong> lost 39.5p to 890.5p despite saying third quarter results would be well ahead of expectations. In a sell note, George O'Connor of Panmure Gordon said: \"In a difficult spending environment we expect Autonomy to face increased competitive pressure. We remind investors about our concerns over Autonomy's valuation and the emerging disconnect between operational performance and share price performance.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere, it's been another bad week for Mike Ashley. The Newcastle owner is currently scouring the world for a buyer for the struggling club, having underwhelmed everyone with the appointment of the Joe Kinnear as its new manager.</p> <p>This morning the papers were full of Kinnear's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/oct/03/newcastleunited.premierleague\">four-letter word tirade</a> against journalists, and on top of that, Ashley has seen a slump in the value of some of his key shareholdings.</p> <p><strong>Sports Direct International </strong>fell 1.45% to a new low of 51p following news that <strong>Blacks Leisure</strong>, the outdoor clothing retailer where Ashley's company paid around 400p a share for a 29.4% stake, had issued its third profit warning this year. Blacks, down 12p to 77.5p , said it expected to make a \u00a34.5m loss for the first half after difficult trading in August.</p> <p>Ashley's rival <strong>JJB Sports</strong> was also hit, down 5.25p to 36.25p. A week ago there were concerns about JJB's banking covenants, but today there was vague talk the company was considering some disposals. It is not clear how crucial its fitness clubs, for example, are to the rest of the business.</p> <p>JJB is also linked to the problems in Iceland, in the sense that chief executive Chris Ronnie bought his 29.9% stake in the company in tandem with Icelandic financial group Exista. It also announced a \u00a320m bridging loan from another Icelandic bank, Kaupthing. There are growing fears about the state of the country's economy, with several of its banks coming under pressure.</p> <p><strong>Regal Petroleum</strong> jumped 42p to 125p despite denying reports it had received a $1.2bn bid approach from <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong>, up 45p to \u00a316.28. Analysts at Fox-Davies Capital, who have a 370p a share price target on Regal, said: \"We believe that at the current price at which the stock trades, the company is a very attractive target. It would be a material addition to a large independent or even a major.\" Indeed there was some late talk in the market that Russia's Lukoil could be interested.</p> <p><strong>John Menzies</strong>, the newspaper distribution and aviation services business, slumped 40.75p to 229.25p. The company said its aviation division would not meet forecasts following cutbacks in passenger and cargo flights.</p> <p>Shore Capital cut its recommendation from hold to sell and said: \"The marked deterioration in trading over the past six weeks leaves us concerned about the outlook for the group. Our concern is that further significant airline capacity cuts and falling cargo volumes appear likely, which could lead to further downgrades for Menzies Aviation.\"</p>",
  "<p>One presidency was never going to be enough for a man of Nicolas Sarkozy's prodigious energy. The hyperactive French leader has seized France's <a href=\" http://ue2008.fr/PFUE/lang/fr\">six month turn</a> at the helm of the European Union with both hands and steered his own course.</p> <p>Whether he is steering in the right direction, and whether he has anyone on board with him, are of course quite separate questions. But there is no denying that he has invested the notion of the European presidency \u2013 often considered little more than a half-yearly turn to host exhibitions and cocktail parties \u2013 with real significance. Whether it collectively likes it or not, Europe has played a uncharacteristically dynamic role in world affairs since Sarkozy took over in July.</p> <p>The question at tomorrow's <a href=\"http://www.inthenews.co.uk/news/autocodes/countries/france/eu-summit-confirmed-amid-financial-turmoil-$1243175.htm\">Paris summit</a> is whether that same dynamism can produce a common response to the threat of a global financial meltdown. The signs are not good. Ireland and now Greece have taken unilateral action to prop up their banks by guaranteeing savings, sending capital sloshing wildly around Europe and making it harder for Sarkozy to broker a set of shared rules and a level playing field.</p> <p>Leaked reports of a supposed \u20ac300bn rescue package Sarkozy was said to be proposing have also soured the mood before the summit gets off the ground. The Germans rejected it before Paris had the chance to disown it. It now seems more likely Sarkozy will try to convince his counterparts from Britain, Germany and Italy to set aside 3% of GDP to help in Europe-wide firefighting.</p> <p>There is no guarantee that Sarkozy will achieve any of this at the Elysee Palace session, breaking the first rule of conventional summit diplomacy \u2013 make sure the deal is done before you meet. But Sarkozy is an unconventional statesman and a natural risk-taker.</p> <p>The risks have so far paid off, more or less. <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/12/europe/13georgia.php\">Sarkozy flew to Moscow</a> in August at the height of the Russian-Georgian conflict without knowing a ceasefire could be achieved. But he managed to stop the fighting and made the EU the principal broker in the region. Little more than a month later, European monitors are busy putting themselves between Russian and Georgian forces.</p> <p>Sarkozy has been much criticised for negotiating a vague truce that allowed Russia to exploit its huge loopholes. But it did stop the march towards Tbilisi long enough for the adversaries to draw breath. Russian officials have since said that the French president's intervention was what stopped the advance on the Georgian capital. By keeping a negotiation channel open, Sarkozy also stopped the chain of events being driven by old cold war reflexes in Moscow, Washington and London.</p> <p>The Georgian intervention, however, was a one-man act. He created a European policy through action. Tomorrow, in Paris, he will need to bring his fellow leaders with him, rather than wait for them to catch up. It will be more difficult and far riskier. Given the precarious state of Europe's financial institutions right now, to meet and fail will be worse than not meeting at all.</p>",
  "<p>A furious bust-up broke out between several of America's biggest high-street banks today as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/citigroup\">Citigroup</a> threatened to sue its west coast rival Wells Fargo for muscling in on an agreed takeover of the struggling financial services group Wachovia.</p> <p>Angry and humiliated Citigroup executives woke up to the news that their government-backed $2.16bn (\u00a31.21bn) buyout of Wachovia's retail banking network had been trumped by a broader deal in which Wells Fargo is paying $15bn for the entirety of Wachovia.</p> <p>The new deal, which requires no support from taxpayers, includes both Wachovia's high-street operations and its asset management and brokerage arms. It puts Wachovia at the centre of an unlikely tug-of-war between two potential saviours. The North Carolina-based firm has been struggling to stay afloat because of its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">vast exposure to sub-prime mortgages</a>.</p> <p>Wachovia's chief executive, Robert Steel, said he had \"great admiration and respect\" for Wells Fargo: \"We are extremely pleased to join forces with this outstanding company.\"</p> <p>Steel said the new arrangement would keep Wachovia intact, avoiding the disruption of breaking up the bank.</p> <p>But the bid came as a complete surprise to Citigroup, which has been providing liquidity support to Wachovia since agreeing on the principles of a deal to buy the struggling bank's 4,800-strong retail chain on Monday, a tie-up aided by a guarantee from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).</p> <p>In a strongly worded statement, Citigroup said it had an exclusivity agreement with Wachovia and that Wells Fargo's involvement constituted \"tortious interference\".</p> <p>Citigroup complained that it had negotiated in good faith and had almost completed a definitive deal. It said: \"Citi has demanded that Wachovia and Wells Fargo terminate and not proceed with any proposed transaction, any conduct in furtherance thereof, or any other act in violation of the exclusivity agreement.\"</p> <p>The row means that in a matter of days, Wachovia has gone from an unloved institution with a bombed out share price and a dubious balance sheet to hot property for two of America's best known names in financial services.</p> <p>Banking shares surged as investors enjoyed fresh burst of confidence that the industry was capable of absorbing its own stragglers without aid from the public purse. Wachovia's stock leapt by $2.67 to $6.58 and bankrupt Washington Mutual jumped by 12% on hopes that its rescue by JP Morgan could be similarly trumped. But Citigroup's stock slumped by nearly 10%.<br><strong><br>West coast meets south east</strong></p> <p>The debacle is a blow for Citigroup's chief executive Vikram Pandit who saw an acquisition of Wachovia as an opportunity to make his mark by creating America's biggest network of high-street branches, a move towards his goal of a \"global universal\" bank. Citigroup had planned to raise $10bn to finance the deal.</p> <p>\"Citigroup loses an attractive, accretive deal,\" said David Trone, a banking analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton, in a research note. \"One silver lining is that Citi can refocus on its own operational problems.\"</p> <p>For regulators, the involvement of Wells Fargo is likely to be a relief as it gets a potential liability off the books of the FDIC which has already seen its funds stretched by the failure of 14 regional banks in the US this year.</p> <p>Under the original buyout, Citigroup was due to accept the first $30bn of any losses from Wachovia's $312bn of mortgage assets but the FDIC swallow any further defaults.</p> <p>In a carefully worded statement, the FDIC's chairman, Sheila Bair, said her authority \"stands behind\" its deal with Citigroup but added that it would be working with other regulators to \"pursue a resolution that serves the public interest\".</p> <p>For Wells Fargo, a takeover builds on its strength on the west coast of the US by adding Wachovia's heartland of the south east. Between them, the two banks have $1.42 trillion in assets, 280,000 staff, 10,700 branches and $787bn in deposits.</p> <p>\"It makes compelling business and strategic sense and is simply an incredible fit,\" said Wells Fargo's chairman, Dick Kovacevich.</p> <p>In common with several of its struggling rivals, Wachovia has been sucked into difficulties by its large portfolio of loans known as \"option ARMs\" which allow borrowers flexibility to set rock-bottom repayment rates. Although popular at the height of the US housing boom, these have proven enormous liabilities since property prices began to slump.</p>",
  "<p>I just watched a beautiful and very powerful <a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/1709110?pg=embed&amp;sec=1709110\">short film about climate change</a>, written and animated by Leo Murray. It's left me with a strong sense that we need to do something really big in response to this threat. So of course that translates into writing a blog. But a blog about a big idea at least. </p> <p>Pretty much everyone seems to be in agreement that the UN meeting of parties to discuss climate change, in Copenhagen in 2009, is the last chance saloon. If the world can't agree to a global deal to bend the curve in global emissions at this meeting, then we may as well just man the metaphorical life rafts and start preparing for the worst. </p> <p>But what might a deal in Copenhagen look like? What should we be calling for? It has to have all the key countries involved \u2013 it can't go backwards from where we are now, with most developed countries (with one notable exception) now accepting a cap on their emissions. And must actually deliver something on the ground. </p> <p>My favourite idea is something I was discussing with Ann Pettifor over coffee the other day. Ann ran the Jubilee 2000 campaign and whilst she is still doing amazing work on the issue of international finance and debt, she has also now turned her attention to the problem of climate change and has kindly agreed to act as an adviser to the <a href=\"http://sandbag.org.uk/\">Sandbag</a> campaign. </p> <p>We discussed the possibility of establishing a global cap on emissions from the power sector. I mentioned a great project called <a href=\"http://carma.org/\">Carma</a> which had already done a lot of the leg work of gathering together data about the world's power stations and making them available on a searchable map. Together, the 50,000 or so stations owned by 4,000 companies documented by Carma, account for around 30% of global emissions of C02. If we could get them under control we would stand a chance of halting the increase in global emissions. The main countries that would need to be included are those with a sizeable fossil-based power sector so \u2013 US, Europe, China, Japan, India, South Africa and so on. </p> <p>Capping a single sector in this way, rather than a country's total emissions, may be more palatable for those still nervous about capping their whole economy. And the power sector is a great place to start \u2013 proven and cost effective lower carbon technologies already exist, the companies don't have to compete on a global market and the stations themselves are big enough and ugly enough to be easily regulated. Satellite technology could even help with the verification process. </p> <p>Obviously it won't be straightforward working out who gets what once the cap is set, but if we can get agreement to the principle, and set the level of the total cap in Copenhagen, then subsequent meetings can thrash out the detail. <br>This shouldn't be the only thing agreed in Copenhagen by any means, but it would be a tangible outcome, provide a truly global framework on which to build, drive investment in the right direction and reduce global emissions. </p> <p>\u0095 Bryony Worthington is the founder of the website <a href=\"http://sandbag.org.uk/\">Sandbag</a> a not-for-profit website that allows its members to buy up carbon emissions trading permits</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown's response to the global financial crisis has been to tinker with the cabinet, rather than launch a more wide-ranging reconstruction of his government. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/03/labour.gordonbrown\">Peter Mandelson's return</a> and changes in departmental organisation have little resemblance to the impact of the Wall Street crash on Labour's 1929-31 administration. </p> <p>In 1931, the global financial crisis split the Labour party in half. Orthodoxy demanded massive public expenditure cuts and no one told <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7278809.stm\">Philip Snowdon</a>, the chancellor that he could abandon the gold standard for public services. The left, especially <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ernest-Bevin-Alan-Bullock/dp/1902301854\">Ernest Bevin</a>, presented many alternative ideas, then and through the 1930s, but orthodoxy reigned. </p> <p>The cabinet created by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_MacDonald\">Ramsey Macdonald</a> contained many of the political heavy weights of the time but it was not a planned response to events, placing the best qualified people into the best positions, but rather a solution driven by political necessity. The only time we have had a planned response to events <a href=\"http://www.information-britain.co.uk/famdates.php?id=354\">was in 1940</a> when the war time coalition was created. That went rather well. </p> <p>Brown's reshuffle is a minor exercise in bringing the best people for the job into the front line but is extremely limited in scope and ambition. The idea of bringing in a group of businessmen to advise the government during the financial crisis will look good but will they have any real power to influence decisions? The creation of the national economic committee and the other changes to departmental roles are also positive moves in managing the crisis. </p> <p>Peter Mandelson's return brings a political heavyweight back into the government and appears to unify Brownites and Blairites. He is back less for his knowledge of world markets, than for his ability to bring discipline to the government's presentation and silence the rebels. In the weeks to come this might make more difference than anything else in restoring some confidence in the financial markets. Alastair Campbell's presence as adviser might also help to steady the ship and organise the message better. </p> <p>Has the threat of an invasion been powerful enough to bring about a grand coalition in this country? There was a time when the ideological divide was such that you could see why only the worst possible crisis would result in a national government. In peace time that is probably right. In Labour terms we now know just how bad the prime minster thinks the financial crisis is: we have a grand coalition running the Labour party.</p>",
  "<p>I've just ripped up this week's post to start again upon hearing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/03/labour.gordonbrown\">news of today's reshuffle</a>. <br><br>Recent political events have been almost entirely overshadowed by the enormous and potentially catastrophic changes in the global economy in the last few weeks. People rightly want our political leaders \u2013 on all sides - to concentrate on minimising the damage to jobs, living standards and our savings from the banking crisis.</p> <p>These seismic events even led <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">David Cameron to scrap his own conference programme</a> in an attempt to show that he understood the public's anxiety.</p> <p>So, it was widely expected that today's reshuffle would be fairly minimal and businesslike, strengthening the government's focus on tackling the economic crisis. But this morning we hear that Peter Mandelson is to return to the cabinet as business secretary in much wider than expected moves at the top of government.</p> <p>Bringing back Mandelson is a shrewd and bold move. He's a figure \u2013 a bit like Marmite \u2013 either loved or loathed. But even those who dislike him or his politics respect his abilities and talent. Crucially, at this critical period for the British and global economy, he is very well-respected in the business community and internationally, and he has the experience and strength to help steer us through these difficult times.</p> <p>It seems that already this appointment is being savaged by some on the left, characterising it as one that will cause division and anger among the ranks of the Labour party. I don't agree. Over recent weeks and months the overwhelming feedback from party members in my constituency has been one of frustration and concern at our poor showing in the polls and worry that we're losing the political agenda. </p> <p>Indeed, at a party meeting last night with the very capable finance minister, Kitty Ussher, the biggest round of applause went to a contribution from a party member calling for the return of an Alastair Campbell-type to communicate the Labour story, past, present and future. If the changes today can help us to get the government back on track, they will be welcomed by the party and, indeed, our supporters.</p> <p>The wider shake-up of government shows that Gordon Brown is determined to use all the talents of the Labour party, and those outside through a number of business appointments. There is indication that the No 10 operation is also being transformed. </p> <p>All in all, on first impressions, the reshuffle shows that on the back of a successful conference season, Gordon Brown is prepared to make bold decisions in the interests of better government in the interests of the country.</p> <p>In contrast, David Cameron had little to offer this week, other than personal anecdotes and a promise of a return to a Thatcher-style approach.</p> <p>Over time, these few weeks may not only be remembered as one of major historical events in the global economy, but also a period when Gordon Brown and the Labour government regained the political agenda.</p>",
  "<p>The UK's independent climate change committee is expected to recommend next week that the government sets a binding target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050, campaigners say.</p> <p>The increase in the target from 60%, hinted at by the prime minister, Gordon Brown, in his party conference speech last month, would bring the UK in line with several other governments including Germany, France and California, although the British target would have the strongest enforcement.</p> <p>The campaign group Friends of the Earth (FoE) said the government will announce whether it will follow the advice of the independent committee of MPs after it publishes its findings on Wednesday. </p> <p>FoE's executive director, Andy Atkins, said: \"The science could not be clearer. The climate change committee can only come to one possible conclusion - the UK can and must cut its carbon dioxide emissions by at least 80% by 2050.<br> \"This is not an issue open for debate or political horse trading - the government must make this commitment to avoid catastrophic climate change.  \"The debate will not be over on Wednesday. The government has yet to explain its decision to leave emissions from planes and ships out of the climate change law \u2013 but the public won't be fooled. \"Hundreds of thousands of people have demanded a strong law that covers all the UK's emissions - they expect their MPs and this Government to deliver.\"</p> <p>Some critics have dismissed the notion of higher targets when they claim government is doing too little to make even lower cuts at present. </p> <p>The announcement will also be closely scrutinised to see whether the government will accept emissions from the aviation and shipping industries as part of the target.</p> <p>But Martyn Williams, climate change campaigner for FoE, said the higher ambition would be likely to lead to tougher interim targets, including 2020.</p> <p>\"It's like me saying I'm [going] for a meeting and I'll try to get there for 10.30 or 11.30; I might be 10 minutes late for either but I'll be there earlier if I aim for 10.30,\" added Williams, who helped lead a major FoE campaign for the climate change bill which introduced the landmark targets.</p> <p>The United Nations' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ipcc\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> has recommended a 50% cut in global emissions by the middle of the century, including reductions of 80-95% by the richest and most polluting nations, including the UK.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the Met Office Hadley Centre <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/01/climatechange.carbonemissions1\">warned</a> global emissions must peak in two years in order to reach the 50% target and avoid the greatest risk of runaway climate change.</p>",
  "<p>Margaret Beckett's remarkable return to government as housing minister shows Gordon Brown means business in imposing discipline in the cabinet. At the age of 65, when many people would be happy to don carpet slippers and flop out, she will be thrilled to rejoin the political fray.</p> <p>Beckett, who will attend cabinet, replaces Caroline Flint, who becomes Europe minister.</p> <p>Gordon Brown asked her to rejoin the government alongside Peter Mandelson as part of a twin-track approach to strengthen the government's economic team.</p> <p>The prime minister wants an experienced politician to handle the present crisis in housing as prices plummet and repossessions soar. Beckett is expected to head a revival of social housing, including the building of more council homes, as part of a government strategy to tackle the crisis.</p> <p>An ultra-loyalist in public who can be scathing about colleagues in private, this long-serving Labour minister has held ministerial and shadow ministerial posts almost continuously for 34 years, ever since Harold Wilson gave her a job as a government whip in 1975. </p> <p>Originally on the left of the party, she got into parliament in October 1974, narrowly defeating dissident ex-Labour MP Dick Taverne. Apart from four years between her defeat in 1979 and her re-election as MP for Derby South in 1983, she has been in parliament ever since. </p> <p>She supported Tony Benn in his failed deputy leadership bid and famously accused Neil Kinnock of being a \"Judas\" for not supporting him. But she backed Kinnock for the Labour leadership in 1983 and has been conspicuously loyal ever since.</p> <p>She was elected deputy leader of the Labour party in 1992 under John Smith. When Smith died in 1994 she became, temporarily, the leader of the party and gave a moving Commons tribute to Smith. She stood for both leader and deputy leader of Labour. Brown backed her for deputy leader but she lost out to John Prescott. </p> <p>Since 1997 she has been president of the Board of Trade, leader of the Commons, environment secretary and foreign secretary. She was devastated to be sacked by Brown last year as he sought to freshen up his team. But her \"big beast\" presence was missed. </p> <p>Brown appointed her to the prestigious backbench role of chair of the intelligence and security committee, one of the most sensitive and secretive committees in parliament. </p> <p>Under Blair she was regarded as one of the safest pair of hands and popped up regularly to defend the government during media firestorms. </p> <p>Her office had a rare panic in 1997 when she was president of the Board of Trade and the US companies were trying to get into the British gas market. </p> <p>The Guardian obtained documents from the US under the Freedom of Information Act about her meetings in the US. It was not the official words that worried her, but the fact that some of the documents could have contained her doodles of the US characters she was meeting, plus her acerbic comments about them.</p> <p>Luckily for her the US kept them to themselves, avoiding a major diplomatic incident. According to her loyal husband of 29 years, Leo, who acts as her office manager, her doodling is quite extensive, including at cabinet meetings. </p> <p>Perhaps when she finally retires a retrospective exhibition at the Cartoonists' Gallery might be appropriate. That day now seems a little further off.</p>",
  "<p>William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, today claimed that the appointment of Peter Mandelson was said a \"stunning failure of judgment\" by Brown.</p> <p>\"In bringing back Peter Mandelson - the man who created Labour spin - he has broken his promise to govern in an honest and open way,\" he said.</p> <p>\"You can only conclude that his appointment was designed to distract from the changes he should have made.</p> <p>\"By leaving in place a chancellor who has failed and a foreign secretary who has undermined him at every opportunity, Gordon Brown has also been exposed as weak.</p> <p>\"With this bizarre reshuffle the prime minister has achieved the impossible and made the government even more dysfunctional.\"</p> <p>But other reaction to Mandelson's appointment was more mixed.</p> <h2>Labour</h2> <p>Ex-Labour MP Tam Dalyell, the former father of the Commons, said: \"I am absolutely delighted. Peter Mandelson was a very effective cabinet minister, both in Northern Ireland and other portfolios. On top of that, he has unique experience in Europe and I think this is a superb appointment. I am 100% delighted.</p> <p>\"I have this volcanic reaction partly because he knows a heck of a lot about it and partly because he will carry great weight with the prime minister. All the old baggage is past history.\"</p> <p>But Peter Kilfoye, the Labour former minister, said: \"I fully support the principle of reshuffling cabinet in order to make it better prepared to meet the needs of the forthcoming election.</p> <p>\"However, I believe that the recall of twice-disgraced former MP Peter Mandelson is a thoroughly retrograde step which will do nothing to promote unity within the Labour party.</p> <p>\"On the contrary, the appointment is highly divisive, and he remains a highly divisive figure within the Labour movement.\"</p> <p>John McDonnell, the Labour leftwinger who ran for leader last year, said he was \"absolutely gobsmacked\" at Mandelson's return to the cabinet, adding: \"The whole Labour movement will be utterly perplexed at what the prime minister's motives are.</p> <p>\"This is an extraordinary step backwards into the worst elements of the Blair era, to reinstate possibly the most divisive figure in Labour's recent history.\"</p> <p>But David Blunkett, the former home secretary, who also quit the government twice, described Mandelson's appointment as a \"masterstroke\".</p> <p>He told Sky News: \"It is a masterstroke in the sense that Peter was an excellent secretary of state for trade and industry but more importantly the connections he has built up as trade commissioner in Europe will be invaluable to the UK.</p> <p>\"Of course it is a political stroke as well because it is inclusive and brings back someone who could be described as nothing else but an arch-Blairite.\"</p> <h2>Unions</h2> <p>The Communication Workers' Union said Mandelson was an experienced politician who had steered through legislation on the postal industry during his previous time at the Department for Trade and Industry Department.</p> <p>\"He again faces many big challenges and we look forward to working with him,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>Several union officials asked for their reaction said they \"too shocked\" to comment.</p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>Business groups welcomed Mandelson's appointment.</p> <p>John Cridland, the deputy director-general of the CBI, said: \"John Hutton has succeeded in giving the new Department for Business a sense of mission and drive that was lacking at its predecessor, the DTI. In particular, he has taken decisive action to try to deliver energy security of supply in the future.</p> <p>\"The Department for Business must have a heavyweight political big hitter at the cabinet table, and we are encouraged that Peter Mandelson is returning to this role.\"</p> <p>John Wright, the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"This shock return is no surprise to us, given Mr Mandelson's previous tenure at the DTI and his current position as Britain's European commissioner for trade.</p> <p>\"Mr Mandelson's experience will mean that he can do away with the probationary period and get straight into the business of dealing with the current credit crunch.</p> <p>\"We will be seeking an early meeting with him in order to convey some very easy-to-implement measures to safeguard the future of small businesses during these difficult times.\"</p> <p>Martin Temple, the chairman of the Engineering Employers' Federation, said: \"John Hutton was a good advocate fighting for business across Whitehall and it was important that they replaced him with a big hitter - which Mr Mandelson certainly is.</p> <p>\"His experience as EU trade commissioner, and having previously been at the old DTI, should be invaluable in ensuring that business continues to have a strong voice at the cabinet table.\"</p> <p>David Frost, the director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Peter Mandelson did a good job at the DTI and clearly understands business.</p> <p>\"His work in Europe and involvement in global trade discussions also mean that he knows where the UK fits within the international context. We look forward to working with him in these challenging economic times.\"</p> <h2>Liberal Democrats</h2> <p>Danny Alexander, Lib Dem leadr Nick Clegg's chief of staff, said: \"Gordon Brown is deluded if he thinks that Peter Mandelson can help him convince the British people that his party still has what it takes to govern this country.</p> <p>\"Resurrecting ex-ministers from the political graveyard is not going to breathe new life into Gordon Brown's zombie government.\"</p> <p>Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker (Lewes) said: \"It is astonishing to see Peter Mandelson back in government yet again. It seems no matter how many times he is wrapped in chains and thrown to the bottom of the Volga, up he pops again.</p> <p>\"True to form, he is attempting to gain power again and, this time, without any accountability to the electorate.</p> <p>\"As a member of the House of Lords, he will not be subject to the usual scrutiny in the House of Commons at question time.\"</p>",
  "<p>Every school child in Scotland aged between 5 and 8 will be given a free lunch each day in an attempt to improve the nation's poor diet and health.</p> <p>The initiative was announced by the Scottish education minister Fiona Hyslop yesterday after a series of pilot projects in primary schools found that the take-up of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/schoolmeals/\">school meals</a> increased by up to 32% when they were free.</p> <p>Ministers estimate the programme, which will be underpinned by new legislation, will cost Scotland's 32 local councils about \u00a330m to implement, but they faced criticism from opposition parties for failing to give councils extra money to fund the initiative.</p> <p>Labour MSPs claimed it was an \"election bribe without the cash\" because Hyslop unveiled the initiative in Fife, where the SNP and Labour are locked in a battle to win the Glenrothes byelection, expected to take place on November 6.</p> <p>Labour MSPs in Fife have formally protested to the head of the Scottish civil service, claiming that ministers broke parliamentary protocol by failing to give them advance notice of Ms Hyslop's visit to their area.</p> <p>The new programme, which is due to begin in August 2010 for all children in primary 1, 2 and 3, was welcomed by Cosla, the Scottish local government association. It rejected Labour's claims it was unfunded and said all Scotland's councils had agreed to fund the project in a local government funding settlement earlier this year.</p> <p>A Cosla spokesman said: \"Local authorities will be in the front line to ensure successful delivery of these important Concordat commitments which will have a positive impact on the health and wellbeing of our children.\"</p> <p>However, that claim was challenged by senior councillors from Inverclyde, Angus, Highland, East Dunbartonshire and North Lanarkshire, who said it was \"extremely difficult\" to pay for. </p> <p>Stephen McCabe, leader of Inverclyde council, said: \"Local authorities across the country are facing severe financial pressures due to rising costs and the impact of the current global credit crunch. </p> <p>\"Unless the Scottish government provides additional funding it is simply a fact of life that other council services will have to be cut to pay for this policy.''</p> <p>Jim Logue, education convenor for North Lanarkshire council, said it would cost his authority \u00a31m to fund, leading to cuts in other services. \"We may have to consider axing its breakfast clubs to pay for the SNP's policy. This will deny some of the poorest children in North Lanarkshire access to the most important meal of the day. </p> <p>\"I am calling on the Scottish government to meet the full cost of this policy if they want to see it delivered. It's simply not good enough to put the burden on local government.\"</p> <p>The pilots involved 35,000 children in West Dunbartonshire, the Borders, Fife, Glasgow and East Ayrshire. The average take-up of the school meals for children not already registered for free meals increased from 41% to 69%. The price per meal was as high as \u00a34.65 a head in the Borders.</p> <p>With Scotland facing rising obesity and deep-seated problems with diet-related diseases, the programme is intended to ensure children are given nutritious and varied diets, with a greater proportion of freshly cooked foods, fruit and vegetables. </p> <p>The Scottish Tories' shadow minister for children, Liz Smith, said it was still unclear whether the most at-risk children would benefit and said councils were under intense financial pressure \u2013 raising further doubts about how successful the programme would be. </p>",

  "<p>Investor panic following <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9806/23/russia/\">Russia's default on its sovereign debt</a> in 1998 led to a stampede by foreign investors to Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport and ultimately delayed the country's integration into the global economy.</p> <p>Wind the clocks forward a decade and Russia is again in the grips of a deepening financial crisis precipitated by the US banking collapse.</p> <p>Ten years ago, millions of Russians had their savings wiped out and many of the leading banks disappeared. The government fell on its sword, accepted culpability and went cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p> <p>Today, there are no queues around the block to empty deposit accounts and life is carrying on per usual, apart from grumbles about rising inflation hitting the cost of bread and other staples.</p> <p>The government is in a different position too as it squats upon $574bn (\u00a3325bn) of foreign currency reserves and $175bn in two oil stabilization funds.</p> <p>Yet Russia has been one of the biggest losers in global markets this summer with stock indices tumbling by over 50% and capital flight leading to an exodus of $57bn since August 8. A rapidly deteriorating financing environment is now showing signs of pricking Moscow's hot property bubble.</p> <p>This frustration led prime minister Putin on Wednesday to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/putin-turns-on-us-irresponsibility-948577.html\">blame US \"irresponsibility\"</a> for failing to deal with the financial crisis affecting the global economy.</p> <p>Putin is partly right pinning the blame on the US but can't attribute all of his country's economic woes to the captains of Wall Street. Russian markets have been pistol-whipped by the international credit crisis but also domestically by its five-day war in Georgia, Russo-centric<br>corpoate flare-ups and Putin's own allegations of <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/07/25/business/steel.php\">price-fixing at miner Mechel</a>.</p> <p>Putin's outburst at a cabinet meeting reflects the frustration of Russian businessmen who see a disconnect between the financial markets and the fundamentals.</p> <p>Russia has a growth rate of 7.6%, a huge current account surplus, a budget surplus from high commodity prices and a booming consumer sector.</p> <p>Yet domestic stock markets have spiralled downwards and lurched wildly out of synch with global trends. The regulator has had to step in three times during the past fortnight to suspend trading on both <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/30/business/EU-Russia-Markets.php\">Moscow's exchanges</a>.</p> <p>Putin has responded to the crisis by pledging $150bn of funds to shore up confidence in the banks while the central bank said it would provide loans without collateral.</p> <p>The credit squeeze has already led Russia's largest broker Renaissance Capital to sell 50% of its shares to billionaire oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov while KIT Finance has ended up in the clutches of Leader, energy giant Gazprom's pension fund manager.</p> <p>More emergency sales and collapses are likely but a systemic failure of 1998 proportions is out of the question.</p> <p>While the credibility of transforming Moscow into a financial hub to rival London, New York or Frankfurt has been dented by recent trials and tribulations, it could provide the wake-up call for wholesale reform of institutions and pensions needed to match that ambition.</p>",

  "<p>Another tidbit from the transcript, apropos nothing but interesting. On climate change, Palin said:</p> <blockquote> <p>I'm not one to attribute every man -- activity of man to the changes in the climate. There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our plane</p> </blockquote> <p>t.</p> <p>This is the second time she has meant to acknowledge that some human activity contributes to global warming but has instead said that <em>every </em>activity of man contributes to global warming. Playing the violin, carving wood, closing the window, you name it. That's a far greater admission that even the most rabid environmental group could have hoped for.<br></p>",
  "<p>Bubbling through the summer, the debate in Camp Brown has seen two opposing viewpoints: should the prime minister extend the hand of friendship to old foes, in a bid to heal the growing rifts within the Labour party? Or should he face down his own version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk\">John Major's \"bastards</a>\", demoting those he suspected of disloyalty, and surrounding himself with close allies.</p> <p>The latter strategy would have seen demotion or the sack for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/johnhutton\">John Hutton</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/hazelblears\">Hazel Blears</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidmiliband\">David Miliband</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jacquismith\">Jacqui Smith</a> and the replacement of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a> with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edballs\">Ed Balls</a> as chancellor (this was under serious consideration).</p> <p>Luckily, Gordon Brown has realised that the only way for Labour to recover is for the factions to unite.</p> <p>Before this reshuffle, ministers were complaining that Brown seemed prepared to undermine even his good friends \u2013 like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/douglasalexander\">Douglas Alexander</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/desbrowne\">Des Browne</a> and Alistair Darling, all of whom have been briefed against in the press. Now the message being sent out from No 10 is that Brown is prepared to forgive, and work with, his oldest enemies. If he can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/03/labour.gordonbrown\">work with Peter Mandelson</a>, one minister told me today, he can work with anyone.</p> <p>The falling out between Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson was personal more than political. Brown felt utterly betrayed when Mandelson backed Tony Blair for the leadership, rather than Brown, after John Smith died. There was talk of Brown exacting his revenge by depriving Mandelson of a second term as European commissioner, a job he enjoyed. But the scent of a big Labour defeat at the next election has brought the two men together. Like his former colleague Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson has had the prime minister's ear in recent months, and has been keen to give advice.</p> <p>At the Labour conference in Manchester last week, Mandelson was much in evidence. He made a very public departure from the conference hotel ahead of Brown's speech, prompting diary items saying that he was deliberately snubbing the prime minister by not waiting to hear the speech. But one No 10 insider told me the diarists were way off mark: in fact Mandelson and Brown have been getting on extremely well.</p> <p>For all its symbolism \u2013 the end of the Blair\u2013Brown feud \u2013 the appointment remains risky. Tony Blair never did get the Labour party, let alone the country, to love Peter Mandelson, and the twice-resigned former minister is certainly not everyone's cup of tea. But there's no doubt that his strategic and communication talents are much needed in a government which has been unable to coordinate its message in recent month.</p> <p>That failure to show a clear direction and get ministers singing from the same hymn sheet is the reason why Damian McBride, Brown's controversial spin doctor, will be taking a back seat. It's a sensible move, though Brown will have to do still more to ensure that his close allies stop their self-destructive habit of briefing against members of the cabinet.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/03/labour.gordonbrown1\">The reshuffle</a> brings intelligent promotions for the best of the old guard \u2013 <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/person/0,,-319,00.html\">Margaret Beckett</a> (who should never have been sacked last year) and the new \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband\">Ed Miliband</a> deserves his new portfolio at Energy and Environment, and now has the chance to prove that he can match his more famous brother.</p> <p>At one point, Gordon Brown considered calling off the reshuffle altogether \u2013 fearing that any attempts to move ministers could prompt his detractors into outright rebellion. But the combination of a successful conference and his handling of the financial crisis have left the prime minister stronger. He needed to make some headlines, and the appointment of Peter Mandelson will certainly do that.</p> <p>But he also needed to show that he can bind the party together. It is to his credit that those who wanted to \"take out\" Brown's enemies were overruled, and good sense has prevailed.</p>",
  "<p>He may be the younger brother of leadership pretender and foreign secretary David Miliband, but Ed Miliband is also a key ally of the prime minister's. </p> <p>He has had a meteoric rise in government, appointed to the cabinet last year after being an MP for just two years. Now, after 15 months as minister for the Cabinet Office, he has the big policy portfolio he craves in a new department of climate change and energy. </p> <p>He is taking on part of the policy portfolio his elder brother David had when he was environment secretary under Tony Blair. </p> <p>Ed, junior to David by three and a half years, is considered by some Westminster observers to have even more talent than his brother. He teases David that he is both the \"good-looking\" and the \"clever\" Miliband.</p> <p>Ed Miliband has been working for Labour since Harriet Harman first headhunted him in 1993 when he was working for Channel 4's Week in Politics show. She was so impressed by the briefing notes he had prepared for an interview with her she decided to poach him. He moved to work for Brown in 1994.</p> <p>Miliband sprang to prominence as the chancellor's special adviser after Labour's 1997 election victory, when he worked across a range of economic and social policy areas, including taxation, public spending and labour market issues. He went on to become chair of the Treasury's council of economic advisers, assisting Brown in the development of long-term policy.</p> <p>But he resigned from the Treasury in 2005 and was elected as MP for Doncaster North in May that year.</p> <p>After just 12 months Tony Blair made him a junior Cabinet Office minister.</p> <p>In government, Miliband remained a close Brown confidant. When the relationship between No 10 and No 11 deteriorated, Ed Miliband was one of the few people who remained on reasonable terms with both camps. </p> <p>Along with Ed Balls, Miliband was reportedly involved in many of the discussions between the Blair and Brown camps as to how the succession should be conducted.</p> <p>The 38-year-old has maintained a relatively low profile as chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.</p> <p>Prior to this he was minister for the third sector, which consists of non-governmental organisations such as voluntary groups and charities.<br> Miliband lives in north London with his girlfriend, Justine, an environmental lawyer.</p> <p>He said after Brown's Labour conference speech in Manchester last week: \"It's one of the best speeches Gordon Brown has ever made \u2013 and the one I had least involvement in.\"</p>",
  "<p>Business leaders have welcomed Peter Mandelson's return to the political fold, characterising the incoming business secretary as just the sort of \"big hitter\" needed during the current economic instability.</p> <p>Mandelson's surprise return comes as Gordon Brown prepares to announce the appointment of a number of senior City figures as \"business ambassadors\" who will champion the country as a place to do business.</p> <p>They are understand to include the Vodafone chairman and former HSBC boss Sir John Bond, the Lloyds TSB chairman, Sir Victor Blank, the Sainsbury's chairman and former Lloyds TSB finance director, Sir Philip Hampton, the Barclays chairman, Marcus Agius, and Mervyn Davis, the chairman of Standard Chartered and a non-executive director of Tesco.</p> <p>Business leaders are expected to call for an early meeting with Geoff Hoon, the chief whip, once he takes up his new post as transport secretary, replacing Ruth Kelly. There will be a new department for climate change and energy, headed by Ed Miliband.</p> <p>\"Mr Mandelson's experience will mean that he can do away with the probationary period and get straight into the business of dealing with the current credit crunch,\" said John Wright, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses.</p> <p>John Cridland, the deputy director-general of the CBI, praised John Hutton, whom Mandelson replaces, for \"giving the new department for business a sense of mission and drive that was lacking at its predecessor, the DTI\".</p> <p>\"The department for business must have a heavyweight political big hitter at the cabinet table, and we are encouraged that Peter Mandelson is returning to this role,\" he said.</p> <p>Martin Temple, chairman of the Engineering Employers Federation, was complimentary about Mandelson's predecessor, who is becoming defence secretary, describing him as \"a good advocate fighting for business across Whitehall\".</p> <p>\"It was important that they replaced him with a big hitter - which Mr Mandelson certainly is,\" he said. \"His experience as EU trade commissioner, and having previously been at the old DTI, should be invaluable in ensuring that business continues to have a strong voice at the Cabinet table.\"</p> <p>David Frost, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said Mandelson \"clearly understands business\".</p> <p>\"His work in Europe and involvement in global trade discussions also mean that he knows where the UK fits within the international context. We look forward to working with him in these challenging economic times.\"</p>",

Photograph: Channel 4</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'm baffled as to why <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/video/jamies-ministry-of-food/catchup.html\">Jamie's new series</a> is called Ministry of Food, as opposed to 'Jamie goes oop north to tell the feckless working classes to get fucking cooking'. Jamie claims to be inspired by the original Ministry of Food which successfully encouraged Britons to eat healthy local food during the second world war. It specialised in tactics that would now be deemed as unacceptably nanny state, even patronising, and send politicians of all creeds running for cover. </p> <p>The Ministry of Food exhorted the nation to up its intake of vegetables using cartoon characters like <a href=\"http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;q=%22Potato+Pete%22&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=title\">Potato Pete</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/woolner/2812824706/\">Dr Carrot</a>. It advocated the delights of <a href=\"http://www.homesweethomefront.co.uk/web_pages/hshf_recipe_woolton_pie_pg.htm\">Woolton Pie</a>, a thrifty concoction of root veg and oatmeal, and the 'National Loaf' made with unprecedented amounts of wholemeal flour. That's pretty much the last time that the British state took a heavily interventionist, hands-on role in improving what we eat, rather than talking about it endlessly while doing bugger all.<br><br>And this is what is so wrong about Jamie's self-appointed Ministry of Food. So far, his subjects - some would say victims - are individuals. That ghastly phrase \"It's all about YOU\" was never so apt. It's as if eating well was exclusively about personal responsibility, a condition best achieved by self-help survivor groups and viral word of mouth. Perish the thought that the state should have a central role in creating an over-arching environment where most people have half a chance of eating well. </p> <p>Watching Jamie, it's almost as if the very concept of a Ministry of Food has become redundant, yet a top-down interventionist approach to improving what we eat is more needed than ever it was. It powers the thinking of the Scottish government which has just announced that it will make <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7646898.stm\">school meals free for all Scottish children</a> in the first three years of school.</p> <p>Jamie puts the wrong people under the grill and his targets are soft. There are a couple of token men, but otherwise it's those familiar magnets for bile - young working class mothers - who get it in the neck. </p> <p>This focus is distorted on two counts. First, it overlooks the fact that Britain's cooking skills deficit also afflicts more affluent classes. The difference is that they are living on Tesco's Finest and M&amp;S ready meals, not takeway kebabs. Second, it fails to recognise how brilliantly well lots of women living on inadequate wages and benefits manage their unacceptably low budgets. Give them a pat on the back for that, not a ticking off.</p> <p>No, the people who really need to be grilled here and told to mend their ways are government ministers. I'd like to see them carpeted, not the teen mums with overdue electricity bills in their hands and kids at their ankles. And here's a preliminary list of questions for Jamie to put to them (perhaps you'd like to suggest a few of your own):</p> <p>\"Why despite all the brouhaha around school meals, are most councils still serving embarrassingly bad food produced on a pitiful budget?\"</p> <p>\"Why, if cooking skills are so endangered, haven't you made cookery lessons a core, compulsory part of the school curriculum?\"</p> <p>\"Why is it that in British hospitals, if your illness doesn't kill you, the hospital food probably will?\"</p> <p>\"Do you think it's acceptable that sports centres throughout the UK sell only fizzy drinks and sweets?\"</p> <p>\"Are you going to hold an enquiry into why fruit and vegetables seem so inexplicably expensive in UK supermarkets?\"</p> <p>Once Jamie has popped these questions, I might, just might be able to watch him encouraging Rotherhamites to cook without being overcome by that queasy, voyeuristic feeling engendered by reality TV shows where smugness-inducing light entertainment masquerades as a campaign for social change.</p>",
  "<p>In the parallel universe in which I obviously live, much of what I am reading in the Guardian is not making much sense to me. Apparently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference\">Labour had a good conference</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/28/davidcameron.toryconference1\">Tories had a bad one</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/29/economy.wall.street.bailout\">capitalism has collapsed</a>. So presumably I won't be getting get paid for this piece with actual money but by some sort of barter system? Perhaps the editor of Cif could just come round and do my garden?</p> <p>When people don't know what is happening to them they turn to the experts and when the \"experts\" don't know they revert back to ideological, almost faith, driven assumptions. A prominent Tory told me the other night he had known about the impending collapse for three years, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2008/sep/12/vince.cable\">Vince Cable</a> has been banging on about it for at least seven and Brown with his supposedly massive intellect ... well what did he know? Why did no one act?</p> <p>A week or so ago we had meltdown conjured as the collapse of mammon. A kind of three cheers and I told you so of attitude. Capitalism was always crap, we always said so and now we were being proved right. How satisfying. The fact that many people other than easily-despised bankers will lose their jobs, not be able to eat organic or care much about the planet as they can't pay for the basics doesn't seem to have bothered us unduly. Austerity as the answer to turbo-capitalism? Great if it just means one less holiday a year. Yet this is all wrong surely? The idea that we <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/oct/01/manufacturing.manufacturingdata\"> don't manufacture anything anymore</a> should possibly be of concern to those who profess themselves to be on the side of the working classes?</p> <p>But no, we are living in a weird bubble because the left (or what is said to constitute it) has no alternative to capitalism. It now stands simply for \"slightly more caring\", ie more regulated, forms of it. Yet so does David Cameron, and that is why I found the party conferences so at odds with the way they were reported. </p> <p>Labour was a success because Brown got his wife out and she seems quite nice? No one stabbed Brown to death on stage or even during the collective binge drinking sessions? David Miliband didn't have a Hestletine moment or much of a moment at all? So all good then.</p> <p>The Tories apparently were over shadowed by events and Cameron's speech was overlong, dull and a return to much traditional Tory territory?</p> <p>That's not how I saw it at all. The special effect of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/25/women.gordonbrown\">Sarah Brown</a> being used to humanise her dejected husband has a limited time span and is a totally retrograde step. It kept the lobby boys who work in a pack happy. I thought it rather desperate. </p> <p>The Daily Mailness of Cameron's speech? Again there was more going on than that. Sure there were the Obama-lite meaningless passages about change but there is no doubt he pushes buttons beyond that of traditional Conservative votes. Cameron can deliver a speech because he bothers to talk directly to people and explain what he is about. You may not agree. You may not like it but Brown and those around him talk down to us as though we are rather annoying children. We shouldn't bother our heads with this economic business. Let them sort it out as they know what they are doing.</p> <p>Clearly they don't. No one does. So do you go with the personable financial advisor who sold you a dodgy insurance policy but waves and smiles every time he sees you or the grizzled, bad-tempered workaholic bank manager who you can never get through to on the phone anyway? </p> <p>Global crisis means that the experience Brown claims or the change Cameron promises don't amount to much. What is really being offered is simply different styles of management.</p> <p>Times really are a changing. Does \"the left\" now champion the nationalisation of just about everything or does it applaud the fundamentally democratic instincts of the many Americans who do not want government to bail out big business? Whose side are you on boys? As far I can see a lot of people are playing fantasy politics, circa 1984. Fiddling while Rome burns?

  "<p>Ed Miliband, the younger brother of the foreign secretary David Miliband, is to lead a newly created department of energy and climate in a move that signals a major rethink of the government's environment policy and reflects the rise of climate change to the top of the national and international environment agendas.</p> <p>With the move of John Hutton, the government's leading advocate of new coal-fired power stations and nuclear power, to the position of defence secretary, the government has paved the way for more integrated energy and environment policy. </p> <p>Industry and environment departments have long been at odds with each other, leading to political embarrassments and charges that different parts of government were pulling in different directions. </p> <p>Government insiders said the department was restructured because of the rising political importance of energy prices and efficiency, the need for one department to take the lead in negotiations for a new international climate treaty next year, and to take lead responsibility for delivering a new emissions reduction target, expected to be announced next week. The new department will have control over nearly two thirds of UK carbon emissions which come from energy for electricity and heat. The remainder is from transport and agriculture.</p> <p>The move was today welcomed by green groups. \"For the last 10 years this government has dithered on climate change, offering us inspiring rhetoric but little in the way of real action. Bringing energy and climate together at last reflects the urgency of the threat we face from climate change,\" said John Sauven, head of Greenpeace. </p> <p>\"Hopefully Ed Miliband will champion efforts to boost renewable energy and energy efficiency, as part of a plan to create the green collar jobs that Britain has so far lost to our European neighbours.\"</p> <p>Other groups were quick to welcome the new department. \"WWF welcomes the government's decision to create a new climate change and energy department - it shows a clear recognition that the UK's chances of hitting its climate targets are inextricably linked to its energy policies,\" said David Norman, head of campaigns at WWF.</p> <p>The first test of Miliband's credibility will be whether he will put a stop to plans for the construction of the UK's first new coal-fired power station in over 30 years at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorth\">Kingsnorth</a> in Kent. This decision has been delayed for months and is proving a deep embarrassment at cabinet level with Ed Miliband's brother, former environment secretary David, arguing that no unabated coal stations should be built. </p> <p>A senior government source played down hopes that the new climate and energy secretary would immediately scrap controversial projects such as Kingsnorth and new nuclear power stations, saying: \"It's not the take over of one by the other, it's really the integration. We still have to keep the lights on [and] we're anxious about the security implications of being very dependent on gas, so these are really hard issues.\"</p> <p>However a source close to Ed Miliband said the two brothers were personally very close: \"They are both intellectual leftists from a tradition of thinking about what it means to be on the left, they are both young and the younger generation tend to see the environment as part of the left. Ed, who's very committed to social justice, will try to find a way of making that part of the environment brief, and want to integrate this issue into Labour thinking and give us definition.\"</p> <p>But Ed Miliband will also have to decide whether to allow department officials to continue lobbying to change the EU's commitment on renewables. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/26/biofuels.climatechange\">Leaked papers</a> show Britain is exerting strong pressure to remove aviation from renewable energy targets.</p> <p>Commentators were today waiting to see how the moves would affect the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which has traditionally led the government on climate change. </p> <p>The independent Sustainable Development Commission (SDC) , which advises government on environment and development, and has often been highly critical of energy policies, said the move was welcome.</p> <p>\"Combining energy and climate change policy under one secretary of state is a welcome move, and one the Sustainable Development Commission has been keen to see for some time. This change will make it far easier to make joined-up decisions in an area which is crucial for the UK and the world,\" said Rebecca Willis, vice-chair, SDC. </p> <p>\"By making the right sustainable energy choices, we can tackle energy security and climate change together, and we look forward to working with Ed Miliband to this happen,\" she said.</p> <p>Business reacted positively: \"Both climate change and energy security are vital national interests that need the government's fullest attention and urgent action. Combining them may help identify both synergies and trade-offs, but we must avoid either one becoming subordinate to the other\", said Neil Bentley, the director of business environment at the CBI.</p> <p>International development groups, now pressing strongly for climate change emissions, struck a note of caution. Liz Gallagher, climate change policy researcher at the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development, struck a note of caution: \"Just setting up a department is not enough. People living in poverty in the developing world are being hit first and hardest by climate change. We hope this means the government will put poor people at the centre of UK climate change policy.\"</p> <p>Many renewable energy organisations said that the new department should be a major boost for the sector. \"Miliband faces a critical need to stabilise the conventional energy sector and to address the UK's need for firm electricity capacity, while avoiding dangerous gas dependency. </p> <p>\"Sentimental support for renewables is counterproductive to this need, as well as being, paradoxically, harmful to climate change policy\", said John Constable, of the Renewable Energy Foundation. </p> <p>Lord Stern, who authored the government's major report on the economics of climate change in 2006, welcomed the new department: \"It shows an understanding of the importance of the subject which requires strong focus and organisation. At the same time it will have to be something that cuts across the whole of government because everything is about reducing emissions, and the consequences.\"</p> <p>The reshuffle comes as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/03/climatechange.ipcc\">campaigners claimed</a> that the government's climate change committee is poised to recommend next week that the government set a binding target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050.</p>",
  "<p>China is now the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, decades earlier than many predicted. Chinese emissions are often viewed as a Chinese production problem, but the role of spiraling consumption in rich nations should not be underestimated. One third of China's territorial emissions come from producing exports.</p> <p>A closer look at China's emissions from 2002\u20132005 shows that half their growth was due to export production. A further third of the growth came from capital investments, with a significant share of this in export industries. Indeed, only 15 per cent of the emissions growth from 2002\u20132005 was due to household and government consumption.</p> <p>By the same argument, emissions in some developed countries have not stabilised if imports are included. In the UK, for example, emissions associated with consumption have increased 18 per cent since 1992 \u2014 even though emissions reported to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have declined.</p> <p><strong>Protectionism is not the answer</strong></p> <p>In many developed countries, industries with vested interests point to China's growing emissions and blame its weak environmental legislation, which they say gives Chinese producers an unfair advantage. These industries argue that they \u2014 and the environment \u2014 need protection in the form of subsidies, free carbon permits or border tax adjustments. They also argue that such protectionist measures will coerce China and other developing countries into taking quantifiable action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions when the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ends in 2012.</p> <p>But ignoring the developed world's share of responsibility for Chinese emissions could put post-2012 debates on a negative and protectionist footing, with serious consequences for world trade. In the words of Ma Kai, the chairman of China's chief economic planning agency, \"the ramifications of limiting the development of developing countries would be even more serious than those from climate change\".<br><strong><br>Linking climate and trade policies</strong></p> <p>Given the importance of trade to many countries' emissions profiles, one would expect it to be an important part of climate policy. Yet the UNFCCC treats countries' emissions as disconnected units, even though trade creates a strong link between them. A clear first step for policymakers is to ensure that climate and trade policies work together.</p> <p>Emissions from China's export industry need not present a problem to the global trading system \u2014 there will always be emissions associated with producing traded goods. The problem lies in China's less than carbon efficient production systems and electricity generation.</p> <p>Internally, China must ensure that new installations use the latest clean technologies. As China rapidly increases its capacity, there is no reason why it cannot become a world leader in developing and using clean technologies. Using the latest technologies now will greatly reduce mitigation costs later, as will investing in urban planning and infrastructure that moves China away from a fossil-fuelled future.</p> <p>And China's exports are so important to global climate that its international trade should play a key role in post-2012 climate policy. Such policy should take advantage of China's huge production capacity and use it to help solve environmental problems by specialising in the products needed in a low-carbon future.</p> <p>But for China to play an active role in post-2012 climate policy, solutions must come from both inside and outside the country. Rich nations can make a first step by replacing rhetoric with action \u2014 for example, by encouraging China to mass produce cheap wind turbines rather than cheap disposable products. The international community must place strict efficiency standards on the use of products. Encouraging China to focus mass production on clean technologies will drive down production costs and speed up global diffusion of technologies such as low-carbon cars, wind turbines and solar panels.</p> <p><strong>Unforseen opportunities</strong></p> <p>These solutions offer the promise of increased production and trade as an incentive for China to invest in clean technologies. But to continue receiving these benefits, China must agree to use a share of the proceeds to clean up its own economy. Global agreements can monitor the country's progress. In the short-term Chinese emissions will continue to increase, but in this case it will be to climate policy's benefit.</p> <p>Rapidly developing countries have the opportunity to lead the world in a low-carbon future. They are expanding at a rate that allows large-scale installation of and experimentation with tomorrow's technologies. By contrast, rich nations suffer from deep sunk costs and entrenched vested interests. Developing countries have the chance to step forward and revolutionise the world in a way no-one thought possible until now.</p> <p>\u0095 Glen Peters is a senior research fellow at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, Norway</p>",

  "<p></p> <p><strong>By David Kaplan</strong></p> <p>Even if the <strong>Department of Justice</strong> says <strong>Google</strong>'s (<a href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=GOOG\">NSDQ: GOOG</a>) search ad pact with <strong>Yahoo</strong> (<a href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=YHOO\">NSDQ: YHOO</a>) clears its antitrust hurdles, <strong>Sen. Herb Kohl</strong> (D-Wisconsin), chair of the antitrust subcommittee, says that it will still require close monitoring to ensure it doesn't threaten the online ad industry, <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/technology-media-telco-SP/idUKN0229193320081002?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technology-media-telco-SP\"><strong>Reuters</strong> reported</a>. By not specifically saying that the deal should be prevented from going forward, Kohl is either giving his tacit assent to the deal or at least resigning himself to its ultimate approval by the DOJ.<br><br>His comment suggest he's certainly looking ahead. While saying Google and Yahoo didn't supply the subcommittee with all the information it would have liked to make a full decision, Kohl encouraged the DOJ to be prepared to act down the road if \"Google is gaining a dominant market position as a result of the Google-Yahoo agreement.\" Since Google already has a dominant position in search, it's hard to discern what Kohl means specifically. He did hint that a red flag should be raised if online ad prices rise significantly as a result of Google/Yahoo, and if Yahoo is either decisively strengthened or weakened.</p> <p>\u2022 Google to start advertising itself?: As the Capitol Hill debate over Google/Yahoo goes on, a different debate is going on internally among the search giant's executives. After avoiding advertisements for itself, some within Google feel the time has come for the company to launch a traditionally-styled ad campaign to promote the brand, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB122299236642900625-lMyQjAxMDI4MjAyMjkwOTIyWj.html\">WSJ reports</a>. While Google founders <strong>Sergey Brin</strong> and <strong>Larry Page</strong> beat back a proposal for a big TV campaign during the Olympics, the company is currently talking to ad shop <strong>Wieden + Kennedy</strong>, which crafted some ads for Google in Japan in August, and a smaller agency, Taxi New York, about doing a campaign around some of its products. Although known better for search and its <strong>AdSense</strong> products, Google has spent about $20 million a year on offline ads, according to TNS Media Intelligence. And with a new G1 phone to promote with <strong>T-Mobile</strong>, it seems Google may be warming up to the idea of a wider offline branding effort.</p> <p><strong>From <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org\">paidContent</a>:</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-revolution-health-waterfront-media-plan-merger-to-compete-with-webmd/\">Revolution Health, Waterfront Media plan merger to compete with WebMD</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-ad-industry-roundup-microsoft-msnbc-local-ads-chevrolet/\">Ad industry roundup: Microsoft; MSNBC; local ads; Chevrolet</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-digital-music-forum-west-state-of-the-digital-union-not-strong-or-sound/\">@ Digital Music Forum west: state of the digital union not strong or sound; changes afoot</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-skypes-china-jv-partner-tom-online-monitoring-and-storing-chats/\">Skype's China JV partner Tom online monitoring and storing chats</a>&lt;<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-newspaper-roundup-spokesman-review/\">Newspaper roundup: NAA; Fairfax; Star-Ledger; Spokesman-Review</a></p> <p><strong>From <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/\">paidContent:UK</a>:</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-nokia-remix-video-interview-mads-winblad-nokia-vp-on-comes-with-music/\">@ Nokia Remix: video interview: Mads Winblad, Nokia VP on Comes With Music</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-sony-has-it-all-now-acquisition-of-bertelsmanns-50-percent-stake-in-son/\">Sony has it all now: acquisition of Bertelsmann's 50% stake in Sony BMG done, BMG dropped</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-thomsonreuters-maintains-outlook-despite-economic-deterioration/\">ThomsonReuters maintains outlook despite economic deterioration</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-nokia-remix-live-first-touch-screen-comes-with-music-emi-on-board-plect/\">@ Nokia Remix live: first touch-screen, comes with music, EMI on board, plectrum included</a></p>",

Economists forecast 100,000 jobs were lost last month, up from 84,000 jobs in August.</p> <p>\"There are plenty of reasons for people not to have bets on the table ahead of the weekend,\" said Jeremy Batstone-Carr at Charles Stanley stockbrokers. \"The markets are going to be treacherous. We are close to two big hurdles, the last of which [the bail-out vote] is after markets in Europe close. So it will take a tenacious investor to make an investment on a day like today.\"<br> Swiss bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ubs\">UBS</a> confirmed today that it would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/03/ubs.creditcrunch\">lay off a further 2,000 people</a> in its troubled investment bank and close most of its commodities business. The job losses come on top of 4,100 UBS investment banking jobs cut in the past year. The new cuts will fall mainly in the US and Britain, but also in Asia and Switzerland.</p> <p>Britain's services sector, which makes up three-quarters of the economy, contracted last month at the sharpest rate since records began 12 years ago, a survey showed today. Weakness in the financial services industry drove activity sharply lower, suggesting the economy is already in recession, its first since 1991, according to economists. The figures, which came after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/02/recession.interestrates\">gloomy manufacturing and construction data</a> this week, bolster the case for an interest rate cut next week.</p> <p>The picture on the high street is also bleak: John Lewis today reported an 8.3% drop in weekly sales at its department stores. \"A combination of unseasonably sunny, warm weather and a huge amount of coverage of the global economic situation added together to give a very tough trading week,\" the retailer said.</p> <p>The US House of Representatives votes on the bail-out package for the second time later today and the outcome is still uncertain. The Senate overwhelmingly voted in favour of the amended bill on Wednesday after the House rejected the original plan on Monday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would not schedule the floor debate until she thought there were enough votes in hand to pass it. </p> <p>Trichet urged lawmakers to pass the bill, which was drawn up by US treasury secretary Henry Paulson. \"Paulson's plan obviously must be passed. It must be. It is necessary,\" he told Europe 1 radio this morning.</p> <p>Grim figures on US factory orders and a surge in claims for US unemployment benefit sent the Dow Jones industrial average down by 348 points to 10,482 yesterday, a fall of 3.2%, putting it on track for its worst week in seven years.</p> <p>\"The bail-out could move us toward a solution, but there are many unresolved issues,\" said Tim Rocks, Asia strategist at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong. </p> <p>Nearly all Asian stockmarkets were in the red. Japan's benchmark Nikkei closed down 1.9% at 10,938, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slid 2.4% to 17,769. Japanese carmakers slumped for a second day after the plunge in factory orders in America - their biggest overseas market.</p> <p>Growing fears over the state of the world economy drove oil prices lower for the third day in a row. New York crude for November delivery fell more than $1 to below $93 a barrel. In London, Brent crude dropped below $90 a barrel for the first time since mid-September. Gold, regarded as a safe-haven investment in turbulent times, rose to $840.40 an ounce.</p> <p>The dollar edged up to \u00a5105.23 from \u00a5104.97 last night in New York. The euro climbed to $1.3862.</p> <p>The dollar has gained 3.9% against a basket of six major currencies so far this week, its biggest weekly rise in 16 years. Banks and other financial institutions have scrambled to buy the US currency after being locked out of frozen money markets.</p> <p>Market players said the severe squeeze in lending between banks - which has driven three-month dollar Libor rates up a full percentage point in two weeks to stand at more than double the Federal Reserve's 2% rate target - was a major factor behind the dollar's gains. \"It's all about fear, the next shoe to drop, and it looks like it's going to be in Europe,\" a senior currency trader at a US investment bank in Hong Kong told Reuters. \"Europeans are paying a dear price to fund themselves in dollars, and that's behind the dollar's rise.\" </p> <p>In last night's vice-presidential debate in the US, Democratic nominee Joe Biden and Republican Sarah Palin both said the financial crisis reflected a failure of oversight but then sparred over responsibility for the mess. \"There was greed and there is corruption on Wall Street. And we need to stop that,\" said Palin, the governor of Alaska. Senator Biden of Delaware said: \"If you need any more proof positive of how bad the economic theories have been, this excessive deregulation, the failure to oversee what was going on, letting Wall Street run wild, I don't think you needed any more evidence than what you see now.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US is slowly but surely being ravaged by demons of its own design. Unlike Britain at the height of its powers, America does not export people or capital. It imports them. </p> <p>Driven by a deep sense of insularity, Washington has attempted to shape the world to suit its interests without ever leaving home \u2013 unless fully armed. The contradiction is that the US has been a military hegemon without being a financial one. Since the second world war, the country has looked instead to others to carry the heavy burden of producing cheap goods and inexpensive services while it made profits.</p> <p>First <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/marshall/\">Europe was rebuilt</a> by exporting to the US, then <a href=\"http://www.jref.com/society/japan_postwar_economic_miracle.shtml\">Japan</a>, then south-east Asia, then China and more recently India. Although Chinese manufacturing workers have improved their lot in the last 15 years, real income was effectively transferred to American consumers. Indian software companies were the beneficiaries of the distribution of American outsourcing, but the American companies took home the real money.</p> <p>The US has been gobbling up the world's resources \u2013 be it labour, capital or minerals \u2013 so that Americans can live beyond their means. That these might run out has never bothered US leaders.</p> <p>The unshakeable belief in the march of science to solve any problem, no matter how big, is an essential part of the American dream. This is why the credit crunch is such a blow. The finance sector was at the heart of the US economy \u2013 its profits accounted for 40% of all private companies, and top workers earned wages beyond the dreams of ordinary workers. Yet all those high-powered Phds could not say what their firms had been trading in, what their bankers were doing, what the risks were and how many bombs were ticking in the basement.</p> <p>The first went off in Bear Stearns. The rest have blown up most of Wall Street in a chain reaction that shows no sign of stopping. The events of the last few weeks also call into question the country's financial sophistication \u2013 its ability to raise cash from taxpayers and borrow from investors. After all if the fact that Lehman Brothers was short by hundreds of billions of dollars slipped past regulators, what else might they have missed in the national accounts?</p> <p>The perception that America remains an exceptional country has blinded many. For too long the world has seen America as the consumer of last resort. China has been its mirror image: the producer of first resort. Beijing has fulfilled this role by manipulating its currency so that its exports remain cheap \u2013 leading to a trillion-dollar cushion of reserves. Others did the same: India has reserves of $300bn. The consequence is that the world has allowed America to borrow egregiously and excessively in its own currency. Any other nation would have been put on bankruptcy alert by the international watchdogs such as the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>This runaway behaviour has fuelled American consumption well beyond reasonable levels. Americans need to stop buying so much and saving too little. There has to be some public acceptance that <a href=\"http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/business/story.html?id=075556bc-511b-4699-a500-5503714b9b85\">government borrowing</a> today implies cuts in spending or increases in tax in the future.</p> <p>What has not been fully recognised is that amidst the wreckage, growth in India and China has dropped but it remains high \u2013 at about 8% a year. The centre of global economic gravity is still shifting away from the west to the east. Percy Mistry, one of India's best known investment bankers, points out that in little over a decade there are likely to be two <a href=\"http://www.indianexpress.com/news/are-we-prepared-to-lose-30-per-cent-of-gdp-to-save-3-per-cent-because.../363921/\">new global currencies</a> that will change the rules of the game: the Chinese yuan and the Indian rupee.</p> <p>There is a difference in perception between these two Asian giants, as Mistry is quick to acknowledge. \"China is seen by the world and treated by it as a majestic tiger; India is more like a Labrador intent more on scratching its itches than on going anywhere.\" Despite the contrasting image of and propaganda issued by these neighbours, both are on a high-growth trajectory with prospects in India appearing even more rosy than in China. Mistry's logic is compelling. If they become the biggest economies in the world, then how long will developed countries allow them to gain from undervalued exchange rates? With protectionist pressures building in the US \u2013 Clinton's Labour secretary Robert Reich is already calling for an era of <a href=\"http://robertreich.blogspot.com/2008/10/new-deal-and-era-of-angry-populism.html\">angry populism</a> \u2013 it cannot be long before the yuan and rupee will be valued by the money markets. This will subject the policies of those ruling these vast populous countries where per capita incomes remain low to an unprecedented degree of scrutiny.</p> <p>Should we not expect the same of the richest among us? The answer is certainly yes. Although the presidential candidates in the US have talked about change, they have not spelt out what that change should be. There is still a perception of prosperity round the corner. Even climate change is being sold, by none other than <a href=\"http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/bookshelf/hot-flat-and-crowded\">Thomas Friedman</a>, as a great new way of exporting American technological breakthroughs to the rest of world. No one is being honest enough to say what is really required: to put the American way of life up for negotiation.</p> <p><em>To keep up with Randeep Ramesh's blog from India, <a href=\"http://www.randeepramesh.blogspot.com/\">go here</a>.</em></p>",
  "<p>Cattlemen and meat packers in the US are ramping up the production of hormone-free beef to sell in the UK and throughout Europe.</p> <p>The singlemindedness of British and European meat eaters has all but ended the longstanding beef war between the US and the EU - even if lawyers for the two sides don't realise it yet.</p> <p>US beef producers acknowledge that even if the country's government prevails in its decade-old case against an EU ban on US beef at the World Trade Organisation, carnivores on this side of the Atlantic will not eat meat produced with growth-enhancing hormones.</p> <p>But emboldened by a growing domestic market for hormone-free beef, cattle farmers across the US are switching to rearing cattle without growth promotants and are <a href=\"http://www.usmef.org/TradeLibrary/News08_0825a.asp\">eyeing Europe as an emerging market</a>. </p> <p>Statistics <a href=\"http://www.usmef.org/TradeLibrary/files/June%202008%201.pdf \">confirm their optimism (pdf)</a>. In the first half of this year the EU imported 7,761 tonnes of US beef, a 179% increase from 2,786 tonnes in 2007.</p> <p>Those figures came from the <a href=\"http://www.usmef.org/\">US Meat Export Federation (USMEF)</a>, a government-sponsored trade association responsible for developing international markets for the red meat industry.</p> <p>Europe, hit by BSE, is being seen as a prime market for beef-exporting countries such as Argentina, Australia Canada as well as the US. </p> <p>\"Within three to five years Europe will be the second or third meat importing market in the world,\" the USMEF vice-president, Thad Lively, said.</p> <p>While the competition will be intense in the UK, US producers believe their grain-fed cattle will be more attractive to customers than grass-fed products from elsewhere in the world. </p> <p>Grain-fed livestock produce a marbled meat with fat interspersed among the muscle tissues, which results in a juicier and more flavoursome food.</p> <p>For US cattle producers and meat packers, entering the EU market requires much more commitment than simply attesting that their beef is hormone free. </p> <p>The EU requires third party verification of all claims, as well as identification and traceability standards and an annual audit.</p> <p>Leann Saunders, the president of third party verification company, IMI Global said EU standards were the toughest in the world but the European market was still attractive to producers already in compliance with the US Department of Agriculture's non hormone-treated cattle standard.</p> <p>Almost 180 of the mainly larger cattle producers and packers have been certified, up more than 100 since the spring. \"The cow calf producers have gone through this intensive process so they could approve cattle for the EU and now they were very excited about it,\" Saunders said.</p> <p>Part of that excitement comes from the fact that Britons and, to some extent, Europeans will buy cuts of beef unpopular with Americans, which means more money to be made per carcass for producers and the packers. </p> <p>Americans prefer fast food such as minced meat hamburgers and steaks, and producers believe European consumer will prefer hindquarter cuts that are better suited for roasting.</p> <p>However, there is no indication that beef will become cheaper in Britain because an EU regulation - the informally named Hilton quota - allows only 58,000 tonnes of beef to be imported from the US, Argentina and other countries before tariffs kick in.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's services sector contracted last month at the fastest rate since records began 12 years ago, fuelling fears that the economy is already in recession. </p> <p>Today's figures, which were driven by a weak financial sector, come after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/02/recession.interestrates\">week of gloomy economic data</a> on the manufacturing and construction sectors, and boosted expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates next week. Some economists are wondering whether the increasingly bleak picture will prompt a half-point cut from 5%, rather than the usual quarter-point move.</p> <p>Nick Kounis at Fortis said the data added to the \"now overwhelming evidence suggesting that the economy is in recession\". \"This report should help to swing a majority in favour of a rate cut at next week's monetary policy committee meeting,\" he said.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply/Markit's purchasing managers' index for services companies dropped to 46 last month from 49.2 in August. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction.</p> <p>\"Following on from the shocking manufacturing figures and a further considerable reduction in construction sector output for September, the services data provide more evidence of rapidly deteriorating activity in the real economy,\" said Paul Smith, senior economist at Markit Economics.</p> <p>Services, manufacturing and construction taken together in a single index has slumped to its lowest level on record, indicating the economy is \"close to, if not in recession\", Smith said.</p> <p>The services sector, which spans banking to cafes and makes up around three-quarters of the British economy, has been shrinking since May. The survey pointed to \"particular weakness\" in the financial services industry.</p> <p>The sharp drop in activity came in a month when the global financial crisis deteriorated sharply, with a number of banking collapses and emergency bail-outs around the world. \"Market conditions were widely reported to be extremely difficult during September as economic uncertainties related to the ongoing financial crisis continued to dominate decision making,\" the survey said.</p> <p>Sharp drops in new and outstanding business prompted employers to lay off more people. The employment index fell to 47.3 from 47.9.</p> <p>At the same time, inflationary pressures weakened. An index measuring firms' costs fell to 65.2, its lowest level since January, while the prices charged index stood at 54.5, the lowest since December.</p>",
  "<p>The recent electoral success of the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1c810cc0-8e87-11dd-9b46-0000779fd18c.html\">far-right parties</a> in Austria and the detention of the alleged Holocaust denier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/02/secondworldwar.australia\">Gerald T\u00f6ben</a> in Britain together raise some awkward questions. How should liberal, democratic societies deal with those who espouse antisemitism and racism, who deny the systematic mass murder of the Jews by the Nazis, and who pour vitriol on Muslims and gay people?</p> <p>Despite decades of \"Holocaust education\" and the building of Holocaust memorials, 29% of Austrian voters cast their ballot for the heirs and admirers of National Socialism. Although the Austrian government is a member of an intergovernmental taskforce dedicated to promoting memory of the Holocaust and its grim lessons worldwide, at home it cannot even convince its own population to stay away from the suit-wearing inheritors of Hitler's toxic ideology.</p> <p>And notwithstanding the metastasisation of antisemitism on the web and state promotion of Holocaust denial, most openly and notoriously by Iran, there are many people in this country who denounce the process that will enable Germany to extradite and prosecute T\u00f6ben. They argue that Britain has a reputation for freedom of speech and has long given asylum to those persecuted for their views. Britain, therefore, should be a haven for such as him even though his utterances are despicable.</p> <p>Something is going wrong here. First, \"Holocaust education\" is bouncing off the far right. Although its advocates claimed that it would help to blunt racism in general and encourage acceptance of difference, it seems that to the target audience not all difference is the same. It has become common for extreme rightwingers to malign Islam or Gypsies, while at the same time averring philo-semitism. The <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1915484/Rome's-new-mayor-promises-purge-of-migrants.html\">new mayor of Rome</a> is a case in point.</p> <p>Second, liberal society's abhorrence of neo-Nazi ideology commingles with a frisson of pleasure, not to say envy, at their naughtiness, taboo-breaking, and defiance of conventional wisdom. At one extreme the defenders of what was once unacceptable come from the swollen ranks of those attracted to \"counterknowledge\", the internet bred and fed millions who believe anything generated by the \"establishment\" must be a half truth or a lie.</p> <p>What links these two phenomena is the insidious claim that there is a \"Holocaust industry\" and that everything from historical research to raising \"Holocaust awareness\" is a ramp to benefit Jewish interests and Israel.</p> <p>Then there are those who deplore Islamophobia, antisemitism, racism and homophobia who simultaneously defend the right of creative figures, and logically anyone else, to cause offence. It would be nice to call this a \"principled\" stand but it is precisely the lack of any aesthetic principle by which creativity can be judged that has reduced the benchmark of appreciation to breaking taboos and upsetting people.</p> <p>These attitudes create a penumbra in which T\u00f6ben and his ilk can operate with impunity. Or not. Because the German authorities see things differently and now have the legal mechanisms to act even if a person alleged to have broken their laws is on UK territory. Yet his case has triggered alarm calls here from those who argue that democracy and tolerance are robust enough not to need laws for their defence. But how would it look if the far right in the UK started taking 5 or 10 or 20% of the vote in local and national elections? If they took power at some level?</p> <p>In countries with a memory of how fragile democracy can be, the fractional loss of liberty entailed in penalising the expression of neo-Nazi views or Holocaust denial seems a small price to pay compared to what can follow if the far right is shielded all the way into power. By contrast we in Britain tend to take the robustness of our democracy for granted. We forget that for much of the last century, democracy was a rare and vulnerable species of political culture, easily rendered extinct. The plight of democracy in most post-communist countries ought to be a reminder that not so much has changed in that respect.</p> <p>With a global recession on the horizon, possibly bringing with it mass unemployment, homelessness, poverty, and cuts in government budgets for welfare, who would like to bank on democracy staying in robust good health? In a few years time, the extradition of T\u00f6ben might look like a smart move if it sends a message to the far right in Austria, not to mention our own breed, that those who incite hatred and seek to undermine liberty will not be given sanctuary.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>10am:</strong> With Alistair Darling and David Miliband and other senior cabinet ministers retaining their jobs, I came into work this morning expecting to write a piece about how this was going to be one of the most boring reshuffles on record. And now Sky is reporting that Peter Mandelson is going to join the government as business secretary! Downing Street sources say they're \"not knocking it down\", which is usually code for it being true.</p> <p>I'll be updating this blog throughout the day as we learn more about the reshuffle. It should be riveting (the reshuffle, I mean, not the blog \u2013 though I hope the blog will be okay too).</p> <p><strong>10.05am:</strong> Derek Draper is on Sky saying \"the whole Labour party is really, really please to have Peter back\". I'm not sure whether that's true. We'll find out in due course. But he's making the point that Mandelson is a \"pretty formidable\" politician, which is undoubtedly true, and that the government needs some PR expertise, which is also undeniable. Draper, of course, used to work for Mandelson but then fell out with him.</p> <p>John Hutton now seems likely to be going to defence. Not sure what's happening to Des Browne yet.</p> <p>A colleague says that John Denham has gone to ground. So he could be on the move.</p> <p><strong>10.15am:</strong> Adam Boulton on Sky says Geoff Hoon, the chief whip, is going to replace Ruth Kelly at transport. He also says that Damian McBride, Brown's political spin doctor, will be moving into a different role.</p> <p>The BBC says Margaret Beckett is tipped for a return. Boulton doesn't know about that, but wonders whether she might replace Mandelson as the UK's European commissioner. As a former foreign secretary she would be well qualified for the role. But there would have to be a byelection. What's her majority? Only 5,657. So maybe not.</p> <p><strong>10.20am:</strong> Des Browne is leaving the government, says Sky. Apparently he was offered another job but refused. So, with Kelly going, too, that's two prominent Catholics leaving the government. At least Browne won't have to take responsibility for the Glenrothes byelection.</p> <p><strong>10.30am:</strong> Nick Brown, the deputy chief whip, is moving up to replace Hoon, according to <a href=\"http://broganblog.dailymail.co.uk/2008/10/mandelson-in-mc.html\">Ben Brogan</a>. That could cause trouble. The Blairites were warning last week that a promotion for Brown could <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/26/labourleadership.gordonbrown\">cause a backlash</a>. But he's been running a parallel whips operation for some time, so I'm not sure how much difference this will make.</p> <p><strong>10.40am: </strong>A colleague points out that it will be Lord Mandelson rejoining the cabinet, because he will have to take a peerage. I'm sure that'll go down well with Labour MPs. I've got to update our story now.</p> <p><strong>11am:</strong> Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, the former Downing Street strategy chief and also a former Mandelson aide, has posted a perceptive analysis of his old boss's return to cabinet <a href=\"http://wpbenjamin.livejournal.com/\">on his blog</a>. Here's the key passage:</p> <blockquote> <p>Last summer Gordon Brown cited the appointments of a collection of minor figures as a evidence that his was a \"government of all the talents\". Like so much over the past 12 months this turned out to be nothing but words. </p> <p>Today Gordon Brown might actually mean it. In returning Peter Mandelson to his rightful place at the heart of government he has drawn to an end a saga which started with a passport application and ended with one of New Labour's creators being jettisoned from office for no obvious reason. </p> <p>Peter Mandelson is one of the few class acts in British politics. His loyalty to the Labour party is without question (though returning to Whitehall was not a straightforward decision for him) and his leadership qualities have never been in doubt. He also now has a wealth of experience at the highest level in global politics have represented Europe in trade talks with heads of government and the WTO. </p> <p>In recent months Gordon Brown sought to re-establish his links with Peter through a series of strategy meetings and many phone calls. It was a reflection on the prime minister's perilous position that he sought advice from someone who he pursued a vendetta against for more than a decade following his failure to replace John Smith as leader of the Labour party in 1994. In that time Gordon Brown's acolytes have held no one in greater contempt than Peter; their reaction to this news, as with most things that they say to the press, is probably unprintable.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wegg-Prosser says he's not sure whether Mandelson can turn things around for Brown, but he says anyone who supports Labour should welcome the appointment.</p> <p><strong>11.15am:</strong> Some new info just in:</p> <p>Hilary Benn's department, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, is being split up. Benn will stay in charge of a slimmed-down department for food. </p> <p>There will be a new department for climate change and energy, headed by Ed Miliband. </p> <p>And Miliband's job as Cabinet Office minister is going to Liam Byrne.</p> <p>The left are already complaining about Mandelson. John McDonnell has said:</p> <blockquote> <p>This is an extraordinary step backwards into the worst elements of the Blair era, to reinstate possibly the most divisive figure in Labour's recent history.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Blair used to operate on the basis that the more unpopular a move was with the left, the better. On that basis, Brown has secured a triumph.</p> <p><strong>11.25am:</strong> Brown is in Luton unveiling a police memorial. We've just seen in on Sky. So is the reshuffle over? Or on hold? Or is someone else running it? </p> <p>McBride is definitely moving into a backroom role, we're told. The FT says he's going to be replaced by Justin Forsyth, an international development special adviser in Downing Street and, <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2008/10/gordons-new-spin-doctor/\">as the FT says</a>, \"a very nice fellow\".</p> <p><strong>11.50am:</strong> Here's some reaction from the blogosphere to the Mandelson appointment. Martin Bright at the <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/martin-bright/2008/10/peter-mandelson-gordon-news\">New Statesman</a> says it's \"great news for British journalism\". Sunder Katwala from the <a href=\"http://nextleft2.blogspot.com/2008/10/mandelsons-return.html\">Fabian Society</a> says this could increase the importance of Europe as an issue, and as a dividing line between the parties. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.order-order.com/2008/10/whatever-happened-to-end-to-spin.html\">Guido Fawkes</a> says it's Brown's attempt to ensure that he's no longer the most unpopular member of the cabinet. Daniel Finkelstein at <a href=\"http://timesonline.typepad.com/comment/2008/10/help-wanted-are.html\">Comment Central</a> wants to know if there's any precedent for someone making a second cabinet comeback. And Philip Johnston at the <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/philip_johnston/blog/2008/10/03/peter_mandelson_return_is_a_sign_of_weakness\">Telegraph</a> says the appointment is a sign of Brown's weakness.</p> <p><strong>12.15pm:</strong> The BBC have been tipping Margaret Beckett for the Cabinet Office \"enforcer\" role. I'm told that's wrong. She is joining the government, but not at the Cabinet Office, where Byrne is heading.</p> <p>So where is she going. Housing? (Not, technically, a cabinet post - Caroline Flint only attends the cabinet. She doesn't belong to it.)</p> <p><strong>12.20pm:</strong> There are two names being mentioned as in the frame for Mandelson's job: Patricia Scotland, the attorney general, and Cathy Ashton. They are both in the Lords (Ashton is the leader of the Lords), so there would not have to be a byelection.</p> <p>Alternatively, will Brown appoint a Tory? That would reinforce his credentials as a pluralist. But I expect Ken Clarke would rather hold on for a cabinet job in a David Cameron government. There's been speculation that he could become leader of the Commons.</p> <p>Will the new UK commissioner get to keep the powerful trade portfolio? I'm told that when a commissioner steps down mid-term, the national replacement normally inherits the job. But the commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, has the final say and he can reshuffle jobs if he wants to. It has happened before.</p> <p><strong>12.35pm:</strong> The Lib Dems have issued a press notice saying: \"Resurrecting ex-ministers from the political graveyard is not going to breathe new life into Gordon Brown's zombie government.\" William Hague is about to issue his own statement on behalf of the Conservatives describing the appointment as \"an act of desperation\". Apparently they've also been compiling a list of all the things Brown and Mandelson have said about each other in the past, which should be fun.</p> <p>But should the Tories really be so confident that this appointment will backfire? I've just spoken to one of Cameron's lieutenants who says he's \"genuinely bemused\" by what Brown's done and who can't work out how Brown can benefit from the appointment of someone unpopular with the public. But Mandelson was getting a bad press even in 1997, and his relationship with Brown in those days was truly dire. That did not stop the two men masterminding an election campaign that kneecapped the Conservative party. I suspect that, in private, some Tories won't quite be so confident.</p> <p>Latest rumour: Margaret Beckett for leader of the Lords.</p> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> Adam Boulton says the former Sun editor, David Yelland, is going to Downing Street to revamp Brown's communications operation. I'm off to refresh our news stories, but I'll be back here soon.</p> <p><strong>2.10pm: </strong>I was away from the desk for a moment, but I gather that Sky are now saying that Yelland won't be going to Downing Street.</p> <p>Boulton's now tipping Beckett for housing. So where's Flint going?</p> <p>Mandelson, apparently, will be doing an interview outside No 10 at about 2.45pm.</p> <p><strong>2.25pm: </strong>This is from <a href=\"http://blogs.independent.co.uk/openhouse/2008/10/return-of-the-j.html\">John Rentoul's blog:</a> \"Peter Mandelson, back in the cabinet? Even Jesus had only two comings.\" It's a neat joke, but \"two comings\" is a bit indelicate for my taste. How about: \"Even Jesus only had one resurrection.\"</p> <p>Nick Robinson, as usual, has a good summary of what's going on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/\">on his blog</a>. His conclusion:</p> <blockquote> <p>So, what's behind Gordon Brown's moves? The economic challenge, the strategic challenge and the threat to his position.</p> <p>Downing Street are presenting this as a strengthening of the cabinet to face the economic crisis - drawing on Peter Mandelson's global experience and contacts whilst creating a new department to handle energy.</p> <p>It's also clear that the PM wants political ballast - Mandelson brings huge strategic and presentational experience whilst Margaret Beckett has long experience of government and the stature to knock ministerial heads together.</p> <p>Finally, and crucially, Brown is trying to shore up his position in the Labour party. The message to the plotters is, in effect, if Mandelson is on my side, isn't it time you were? The people that founded New Labour - Brown, Blair (who's in regular contact with him), Mandelson and Alastair Campbell - are said to have put aside their differences to work together again.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> He's back. Mandelson's just walked into Downing Street, having done a brief doorstep with the TV crews, wearing on his face the most enormous grin you've ever seen. \"Like the cat that's got the cream,\" according to the BBC's James Landale. </p> <p>Mandelson said he had had his \"ups and downs\" with Brown, that he had not expected to be appointed, but that he was glad to serve. \"It's all hands to the deck.\"</p> <p>Sky are saying that Jan Royall will be the new leader of the Lords. She had been chief whip in the Lords, but now she's heading for the cabinet. She was a longstanding Kinnock aide. Mandelson first made his name in that era too. The return of the Kinnockites?</p> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> I've just come out of the Downing Street briefing and we've got the full list of the cabinet. It's as we've been reporting. Here are the points that are new, or that we could not confirm as fact earlier:</p> <p>Jan Royall becomes leader of the Lords.</p> <p>Jim Murphy becomes Scottish secretary.</p> <p>Nick Brown is chief whip, but not in cabinet. He will attend instead without full membership.</p> <p>Margaret Beckett replaces Caroline Flint as housing minister. She will attend cabinet, but not as a full member.</p> <p>Caroline Flint replaces Murphy as Europe minister, attending cabinet when Europe is discussed.</p> <p>Tony McNulty becomes employment minister, attending cabinet but not as a full member.</p> <p>Stephen Carter, Brown's chief of staff, is becoming a minister for communications, technology and broadcasting in the Lords.</p> <p>Paul Myners, chairman of the Guardian Media Group, is becoming a City minister.</p> <p>And Lord Drayson is rejoining the government as science minister.</p> <p>Brown is doing a press conference with Alistair Darling in Downing Street shortly.</p> <p><strong>4.50pm:</strong> The press conference is over. Asked why he was appointing Mandelson, Brown said: \"Serious people are needed for serious times.\" When Brown told the Labour conference that it was \"no time for a novice\" I thought that was a cheap conference slogan. But I now realise it's a strategy.</p> <p>Barry Gardiner, one of the Labour MPs calling for a leadership election before the conference, has just been on News 24 and his reaction was very significant. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>This is the Gordon Brown that many of us have wanted to see for about a year. It shows decisiveness, it shows leadership and being able to put aside personal animosity in the way that he has been able to do with Peter Mandelson is immensely good.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>5.20pm:</strong> There's an interesting summary of views from the Times' commentariat on <a href=\"http://timesonline.typepad.com/comment/2008/10/phil-collins-if.html\">Daniel Finkelstein's blog</a>, which is worth a read if you're still trying to make sense of this all. The general consensus seems to be that it's a brilliant short-term move, but that in the long-run it will fail.</p> <p>If there are points in politics for originality, then Brown has triumphed. I started working in the lobby in 1994 and I can't remember a government appointment that came as such a surprise, with such game-changing potential. Patrick Wintour wrote about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/02/davidcameron.toryconference\">\"Hail Mary\" pass</a> the other day. If you're looking for a good example of one, this is it.</p> <p>Nick Robinson suggested Brown was in effect forming an economic war cabinet. Another colleague mentioned the Ramsay MacDonald coalition government. But will the voters be impressed? And will Brown and Mandelson (and their allies) manage to stop feuding? Who knows? I really have no idea.</p> <p>Still, you never get bored in this job.</p> <p>I've got to wind up now. Thanks for reading and for the comments.</p>",
  "<p>Is journalism the reason that people are buying fewer newspapers? And, by implication, are journalists therefore to blame for the crisis facing the press? My unhesitating answer to both questions: no.</p> <p>I have not made that clear enough in what I have written previously while documenting the decline of newsprint newspapers. So, prompted by an excellent analysis in the latest <a href=\"http://www.ajr.org/\">American Journalism Review</a>, let me put that right.</p> <p>There cannot be any doubt that journalists themselves - the reporters, sub-editors, photographers, feature writers, columnists, page designers - cannot be held responsible for either the financial woes of the industry nor for the public turning its back on the \"products\" that contain their work.</p> <p>Even if we concede that <em>some</em> journalists lived high on the hog in past times and that, through the <a href=\"http://www.nuj.org.uk/\">National Union of Journalists</a> in <em>some</em> papers, they defended overmanning and were guilty of low output, they are still blameless. In general, as providers of the basic content, they have performed their tasks in good faith and with a dedication that marked them out from every other newspaper employee (and some employers). </p> <p>This is as true of journalists in Britain's nationals as it is of those working for regional daily and local weekly papers. It is also true of broadcasting journalists and those who work on magazines. We, the infantry, the people who create the raw material, have no reason to feel guilty.</p> <p>It is important to say this - to say it to ourselves, and to say it to the public (the people we seek to serve) - as we record the gradual demise of newspapers and the weekly roll-call of redundancies. It isn't our fault.</p> <p>The truth is that we are being assailed by revolutionary technological forces completely outside of our control. To make it worse, the wider global financial crisis means that we are caught up in something of a perfect storm. It is wrecking the business models of newspapers and overturning all the old certainties. </p> <p>We journalists are <em><strong>not</strong></em> paying the price for our own (alleged) failures. Whether your are an enthusiastic supporter of the digital age as it heralds the replacement of top-down journalism with bottom-up journalism, or whether you remain a stubborn believer in the virtues of journalists as information gatekeepers, you are not the cause of the current calamity. </p> <p>Both digital revolutionaries and dinosaurs face the same sad situation because the economic catastrophe has robbed media companies of the chance to make a smooth transition from one platform to another.</p> <p>It was always going to be difficult to effect the switch of advertising from print to online. We also recognised that website revenue would never achieve the volumes enjoyed by print. But that already rocky road has now been struck by an earthquake. Collapse is imminent. </p> <p>Writing from a US perspective, <strong>Washington Post</strong> reporter <strong>Paul Farhi</strong> points out in his AJR article, <a href=\"http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4623\">Don't blame the journalism</a>, that the long-run cycle of newspaper decline is not due to newspapers (and journalists) but is \"everything to do with the newspaper business.\" He writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Even a paper stocked with the world's finest editorial minds wouldn't have a fighting chance against the economic and technological forces arrayed against the business. The critics have it exactly backward: journalists and journalism are the victims, not the cause, of the industry's shaken state.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, we British journalists do tend to believe that American journalism is boring and unreadable. But the interesting fact - <em>FACT</em> - is that the declining sales and declining profits of US and UK newspapers are roughly similar in scale despite the differences between their journalism and our journalism. Here's Farhi again:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The problem has little to do with the reporting, packaging and selling of information. It's much bigger than that. The gravest threats include the flight of classified advertisers, the deterioration of retail advertising and the indebtedness of newspaper owners. </p> <p>\"Wrap all these factors together and you've set in motion the kind of slash-and-burn tactics that will hasten, not forestall, the end.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And then he moves on to the digital revolution's major effect on the business:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The real revelation of the internet is not what it has done to newspaper readership \u2013 it has in fact expanded it \u2013 but how it has sapped newspapers' economic lifeblood. The most serious erosion has occurred in classified advertising, which once made up more than 40% of a newspaper's revenues and more than half its profits. </p> <p>\"Classified advertisers didn't desert newspapers because they disliked our political coverage or our sports sections, but because they had alternatives.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There's more to appreciate in his lengthy piece too. Despite its American specificity, it applies to Britain. But where do we go from here? If large media companies do collapse will the journalism of the future be a vocational activity? Now there's a question.</p>",
  "<p>No one needs to be reminded that Britain's housebuilders are facing a tough time. Yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/03/banking.bankofengland\">Nationwide survey </a>showing a 12.4% annual decline in prices was just the latest in a string of grim statistics, which also included Dresdner Kleinwort's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2008/sep/30/housingmarket.barrattdevelopments\">apocalyptic note </a>on the sector after a whistlestop tour of some of the country's housing developments.</p> <p>As a result investors have become increasingly concerned about the builders' funding situation. <strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong>, for example, had already announced it was in talks with some of its lenders about amending borrowing agreements on its \u00a31.7bn of debt. Today the company announced its lenders had agreed to relax the loan covenants, but it has now decided to extend the talks to include Eurobond holders. This means the revised borrowing agreement will not be completed until early next year.</p> <p>The company, not surprisingly, repeated its \"cautious\" view of the outlook for the UK housing market. \"In the current environment, securing a comprehensive financing structure that is robust under all reasonable downside scenarios is essential,\" it said.</p> <p>It was also at pains to make clear it was still in compliance with its existing covenants, and had enough cash to keep going.</p> <p>Other housebuilders have seen the cost of servicing their debt increase by around two percentage points in recent weeks, showing the depth of the problem.</p> <p>Today's announcement has seen Taylor's shares slip 1.5p to 33p while <strong>Barratt Developments</strong> is down 2p at 108p and <strong>Persimmon</strong> has fallen 2.5p to 390.75p.</p> <p>Overall the market is biding its time before two key US events, the non-farm payroll figures due this afternoon and, inevitably, the second vote by Congress on the $700bn bail out plan for the banking system.</p> <p>Andrew Turnbull at spread better ODL Securities said: \"There is a possibility that the forthcoming events of today could dictate the direction of our economy in a significant way.

In light of the financial market turbulence of recent weeks, we would be surprised if this has improved.\"</p> <p>Several brokers have cut their price targets for <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> after yesterday's trading update, while at the same time keeping their recommendations. UBS retained its neutral rating, while Bernstein stayed at market perform. Cazenove and JP Morgan both lifted their recommendations slightly.</p> <p>But in the wake of a second week of poor sales from John Lewis, Seymour Pierce was less generous.</p> <p>\"We continue to have a sell recommendation on M&amp;S,\" said analyst Freddie George, \"which I see has been upgraded by a number of brokers and would sell the stock into strength.

  "<p>There was understandable pride this week in Spain as the media revelled in the fact that the Financial Times <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1f50c5d4-8e65-11dd-9b46-0000779fd18c.html\">had suggested</a> the world's central bankers \"take Spanish lessons\".</p> <p>In the UK, the contrast between hapless British banking and the smooth-operating Spaniards looks striking: Spain's largest bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/santander\">Santander</a> swooped in to pick up the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/28/bradfordbingley.banking2\">best assets of Bradford &amp; Bingley</a>, having already added its red flame logo to Abbey National branches up and down the country after buying that high street name four years ago. Is Santander evidence Spanish banks will strut and swagger their way through the global downturn, as other banks are felled by the fallout from the US subprime crisis and its ensuing credit crunch?</p> <p>Santander has been partly shielded from global turmoil <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/30/santander.bradfordbingley\">through tougher regulation</a> in its home country. The Bank of Spain is especially prudent on risk after a Spanish banking crisis in the 1970s and, consequently, hasn't allowed bankers to take huge amounts of risky mortgages off their books by repackaging them as fancy investment vehicles, which have plummeted in value. The lessons? It sometime pays for small countries to buck global trends and national banks should be involved in regulation.</p> <p>It's tempting to see Spanish banks as the champions of the best forms of risk assessment. However, it is still unclear whether more prudent regulation will help the country's banks weather the current financial storm better than their peers in other countries. Part of Santander's success, after all, lies in its expansion abroad, away from its home country, which has entered a sharp economic downturn. There, Santander bank branch managers are now competing for deposits from increasingly cash-strapped Spaniards, 2.6 million of whom are now jobless.</p> <p>Santander, the Eurozone's largest bank, is in a stronger position than its national competitors, unlike many Spanish banks, aggressively offering \"no fee\" accounts to customers who deposit their wages with it. But analysts fear the future of smaller peers is less buoyant, as they are more vulnerable to liquidity tightening globally. Back in February, Santander's chief financial officer said its short-term liquidity position was very strong, but added. \"In the medium-to long-term, what we have is access to wholesale funding markets that are asking premiums few banks are prepared to pay at the moment.\" </p> <p>While many of Spain's <em>cajas</em>, the smaller savings banks, have, like the UK's building societies, thrived for the last decade by supplying enthusiastic homebuyers with competitive mortgages, they are now vulnerable. As the country's housing bubble has burst and fewer customers want or can afford to buy, bread-and-butter mortgage business is harder to come by. Businesses that took out loans with banks are also facing tougher times, particularly in the construction sector where they are laying off thousands of workers rather than approaching their local branch manager for loans to expand. </p> <p>Spanish bankers, like those in the rest of the world, will doubtlessly be keen to draw their own lessons before they take up teaching others.</p>",

Only this time something's different. Can you feel it in the atmosphere -- that tingling sensation that absolutely anything could happen tonight, and that what does happen might be quite excruciating and/or of high comedic value? Sarah Palin and Joe Biden have arrived in St Louis, Missouri, for what may well turn out to be the most consequential vice-presidential debate since vice-presidential debates began in 1976, and I'll be liveblogging it here from around <strong>8.45pm eastern time</strong> (<strong>1.45am UK time</strong> \u2014 you can watch the debate live on BBC News Channel, Freeview 080). The debate itself begins at <strong>9pm/2am</strong> and lasts 90 minutes. We'll try to find you some interesting things to say about it all, and we'll bring 'em to ya!</p> <p>Following a week of embarrassing interview clips, and polls that look bad for McCain and <a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10535499http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10535499\">for Palin specifically,</a> expectations for the Republican running-mate seem so low that she has a serious chance of pulling off a victory of sorts tonight. On the other hand, various Alaskan politicians and others have been busy pointing our that, in the past, Palin has tended to do much better in debates than in other public-speaking contexts. Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe pushed this notion as far as it would go today, <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/plouffe_palin_is_one_of_the_be.php\">drawing gales of laughter from the press corps</a> when he claimed Palin was \"one of the best debaters in American politics.\" But this isn't all one giant Machiavellian game of expectations management. The McCain campaign's nervousness has been too acute and voluminous not to be real, and there's no denying that the stakes tonight for Palin <a href=\"http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/whats-at-stake-in-tonights-debate/?ref=opinion\">are enormously high</a>. </p> <p>In recent hours, the McCain campaign has been sounding increasingly optimistic: their hopes seem high that Palin will come into her own, hammering Obama and Biden hard in almost every response she gives, including on the topic of <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14220.html\">Biden's \"foreign policy blunders\"</a> -- which is certainly what you might call audacious, in the circumstances. Biden faces serious challenges of his own: he must avoid his tendency to ramble and to exaggerate; he'll focus his attacks on McCain, and must avoid the merest hint of condescension. Things that Biden should avoid saying tonight include \"why don't you let me answer this one, sweetheart?\" and \"don't you worry your pretty little head about that.\"</p> <p>The <strong>moderator</strong> of tonight's debate is the PBS news broadcaster Gwen Ifill, who'll arrive on a wheelchair after breaking her ankle earlier this week. Ifill has been the <a href=\"http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/zontv/2008/10/debate_moderator_gwen_ifill_at.html\">target of conservative rage</a> this week because of a book she'll be releasing on Inauguration Day about the \"age of Obama.\" (As an even-handed member of the Liberal Media Elite, I'll concede that this doesn't look great, since she'll presumably sell more copies if Obama wins. But of course this hardly means she'll be biased against Palin in her questioning: it's surely more likely that she'll be so acutely aware of that risk that she'll go too far in the other direction.) The <strong>format</strong> is less freeform than last week's presidential debate: Ifill will ask a question, each candidate will have 90 seconds to answer, and then there'll be a follow-up period of just two minutes. This tighter structure came at the request of the Republicans \u2014 in return, they agreed to a Democratic demand to have the candidates debate at lecterns, not seated at a table. </p> <p>Tonight's <strong>drinking game</strong>, which for me will involve <a href=\"http://beerbloggyblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/east-india-pale-ale-by-brooklyn-brewery.html\">Brooklyn Brewery India Pale Ale</a>, is simple. One drink (shot/gulp/whatever) every time Biden refers to his fondness for travelling on Amtrak trains, or to being downed in a helicopter in the mountains of Afghanistan, and one drink when Palin refers to herself as a \"Joe Sixpack American\" or \"regular maverick outsider reformer maverick\". One drink whenever you happen to remember the phrase \"a heartbeat away from the presidency.\" And in the interests of balance: a drink, too, whenever Palin makes a well-argued, semantically intact, logical and lucid argument -- or WASILLA for short. Join me shortly! (Meanwhile, don't forget <a href=\"http://interviewpalin.com/\">Interview Sarah Palin</a>, where you can generate your own random Palin quotes to pass the time...) </p> <p><strong>8.52pm</strong>: (all times eastern): I'm reminded by <a href=\"http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2008/10/the-expectation.html\">Majikthise</a> of an expectations-management maneouevre even more comical than Plouffe's \u2014 the 2004 attempt by a Bush campaign strategist to claim that John Kerry was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34246-2004Sep19.html\">a better debater than Cicero</a>. </p> <p><strong>8.55pm</strong>: OK, Gwen Ifill's on stage now. So far, she hasn't done a twinkly, homespun little introduction like Jim Lehrer did last Friday, asking everybody to turn their mobile phones off.</p> <p><strong>9.00pm</strong>: Here we go. Ifill sets out the format, telling us the questions are all hers, not cleared with either campaign or the debates commission etc. The candidates shake hands, a little awkwardly. \"Nice to meet you!\" Palin says, audibly. \"Can I call you Joe?\" I think he said yes.</p> <p><strong>9.02pm</strong>: A question, first to Biden, on the last few days of the financial crisis. He gallops through a list of Obama policy proposals. Palin's answer: go to \"a kids' soccer game on a Saturday\" and ask them how the soccer moms feel, and \"you betcha\" they'll be afraid. She's looking directly at the camera, which Biden didn't, and answering perfectly coherently, though she probably shouldn't have reminded everyone about John McCain's \"campaign-suspension\" antics of last week, since, well, he didn't really suspend his campaigning. Biden brings it back around to McCain's \"fundamentals are strong\", to which Palin's response seems much less good. She's part of \"team of mavericks\", she explains: time for a drink! \"I do respect your years in the US Senate, but I think Americans are craving something different.\"</p> <p><strong>9.12pm</strong>: A spectacular explosion of populist folksiness from Palin in response a question about who should be blamed for the subprime mortgage crisis. We're less than 10 minutes in and we have soccer moms and now \"Joe Sixpack\": DRINK! Oh dear, I'm going to be intoxicated very soon indeed. Biden repeats his \"John McCain is a good man, but wrong\" line, and brings up McCain's recent article that seemed to call for deregulation of the health industry, following the example of the banking industry. \"I was recently at my local gas station,\" he begins. Biden can play the folksiness game, too.</p> <p><strong>9.15pm</strong>: Palin is sticking <em>hard</em> to her talking points, including a now-notorious (and false) charge about Obama having voted to raise taxes on families -- as opposed to individuals -- earning more than $42,000. Biden comes back strongly, and with his emerging basic attack on Palin, which is that she isn't answering any of the questions. \"I'm still on the tax thing,\" Palin responds -- \"I may not answer the questions the way you or the moderator want to hear, but I'm going to talk to the American people.\" Wow! Biden, who has the best cosmetic dentistry in America, despite having no money, can only grin broadly (condescendingly?) in response. </p> <p><strong>9.20pm</strong>: This tactic of not even really pretending to answer the question might prove to be very clever indeed. Palin's back onto Biden's statement about paying taxes being patriotic. No, Palin says \u2014 \"Patriotic is saying: 'Government, you know, you're not always the solution, sometimes you're the problem.'\" Biden can only grin as she now says (did she really just say this?) that tax breaks don't cost the government money. \"Gwen, I don't know where to start,\" Biden says, and goes on to hammer McCain's healthcare funding proposals, under which, Biden says, 20m people would lose their coverage. \"I call that the ultimate Bridge to Nowhere,\" he says, and looks across at Palin. The audience \u2014 instructed to keep quiet \u2014 laughs loudly.</p> <p><strong>9.24pm</strong>: \"What promises will your campaign not be able to keep because of the bailout?\" Palin spins off into how she broke the power of oil companies in Alaska while Obama supported tax breaks for them, which has nothing to do with the question. She talks about companies and governments like they are little children. \"The oil companies, bless their hearts, are doing what they need to do...\" Ifill picks her up on -- did I mention this? -- totally failing to answer the question.</p> <p><strong>9.28pm</strong>: Now we're arguing about who predicted the subprime mortgage first. Oh no, we're not! \"I just want to talk about energy,\" says Palin, midway through a segment on bankruptcy. Energy independence! Now she's on solid ground. \"Energy independence is the key to this nation's future.\" Ifill picks up the energy theme and moves to climate change: what is true and what is false about the cause of climate change? \"I'm not one to attribute every activity of man to changes in the climate,\" Palin says. And who could argue with that? I made spaghetti bolognese for dinner last night, and I can confirm that it wasn't because of changes in the climate. Biden: \"If you don't understand what the cause is, it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution.\"</p> <p><strong>9.35pm</strong>: \"Drill, baby, drill!\" says Palin -- a drink, I think, even though I didn't specify this one earlier. Palin hits Biden on his opposition to offshore drilling and his earlier remarks about clean coal. Biden is carefully refering to Palin as \"the governor\" and McCain as \"John\", treating Palin with respect and McCain as if he were a dear friend who'd tragically gone off the rails. Which is, perhaps, exactly how Biden sees it.</p> <p><strong>9.37pm</strong>: \"Do you support granting same-sex benefits to couples?\" Biden is unequivocal, and vigorously so: yes. \"Not if it goes closer and closer to redefining the traditional definition of marriage,\" Palin says. But she would be \"tolerant of adults in American choosing their partners.\" So that's all right! But she does want to stress her \"non-support for anything but a traditional definition of marriage.\" </p> <p><strong>9.40pm</strong>: Foreign policy. Here we go. Palin praises the surge in Iraq and repeats what sounds like a well-memorised line about how Biden was right to criticise Obama's position on the surge. \"We cannot afford to lose,\" Palin says, though she offers no plan whatsoever, as Biden points out. CNN's strange live monitoring opinion-o-meter, measuring responses to the debate among uncommitted voters in Ohio, shoots up to its highest level so far when Biden sets out the Obama withdrawal plan, though I suspect the CNN device is a bit meaningless, really. \"Your plan is a white flag of surrender in Iraq,\" Palin says in reply.</p> <p><strong>9.45pm</strong>: Which is more dangerous \u2014 a nuclear Iran or an unstable Pakistan? Neither candidate is going to pick one over the other. Palin hammers away at how Obama might meet with Ahmedinejad. \"That is beyond bad judgment \u2014 that is dangerous.\" Last week at the UN, \"Henry Kissinger shared with me his passion for diplomacy,\" she says, which for some reason I can't quite put my finger on sounds very odd. Perhaps because of Henry Kissinger's passion for carpet-bombing. </p> <p>Biden reminds everyone of John McCain's bizarre Spain gaffe. Bizarre Spain Gaffe might be quite a good name for a short-lived, overintellectual indie band, now I come to think of it.</p> <p><strong>9.52pm</strong>: Israel. Everyone loves Israel! \"I'm so encouraged to know that we both love Israel,\" Palin says, then randomly swerves into accusing Biden of \"too much fingerpointing\" in looking backwards at the Bush administration. Biden looks amused. \"John McCain has been the maverick,\" Palin says. Drink! \"I know, senator Biden, that you respect that, and I respect you for that.\" </p> <p>Palin's decision to criticise Biden for dwelling too much on Bush's mistakes is an open door for Biden, who replies with his strongest passage yet, listing all the ways in which he doesn't see how McCain/Palin would be different to the Bush administration. You know one way in which Palin is <em>exactly</em> like Bush? She says \"nucular\". Also, she smiles strangely. This in itself is not a disqualification from the vice-presidency, I suppose.</p> <p><strong>10.00pm</strong>: When Biden is listing facts, Palin smiles indulgently, as if he were being naughty. \"It's so obvious that I'm a Washington outsider, and I'm not used to how you guys operate,\" she says, in ultra-aw-shucks mode, responding to Biden's comments on why he voted to authorise military action in Iraq. </p> <p><strong>10.07pm</strong>: It's the heartbeat-away-from-a-presidency question. Pretty tough to ask the candidates to speculate on the possibility of their running-mates' deaths; Biden handles it in the most obvious fashion by saying he'd implement Obama's policies -- which enables him to reel off a long list of Obama's policies. The CNN dial-twiddlers love this speech. Palin: \"As for disagreeing with John McCain... what do you expect? A team of mavericks! We're not going to agree on everything.\" She winks at the camera: seriously. If McCain died, Palin would bring \"wisdom from Wasilla Main Street to Washington.\" Sorry, but there's really no distinction at this point between Palin and Tina Fey's impersonation of Palin.</p> <p><strong>10.12pm</strong>: If you want to know what the middle classes are feeling about getting the short end of the economic stick, Biden says, \"come to Home Depot, where I spend a lot of time.\" Doing what? Looking at drill bits, maybe. </p> <p><strong>10.13pm</strong>: Let the record show that Sarah Palin just said \"doggone it\", as part of an excruciating schoolteacherly telling-off of Biden for mentioning the failings of the Bush administration. Then a shoutout to the school where one of her family members teaches. The debate-as-local-radio-phone-in.</p> <p><strong>10.15pm</strong>: In answering a question on the role of the vice-presidency, Palin appears to call for an increase in the power of the vice-presidency. Er \u2014 how about no? She also backs Dick Cheney's radical and controversial view that the vice-presidency is neither part of the executive nor the legislature. She says \"also\" a lot, also.</p> <p><strong>10.18pm</strong>: What is your Achilles heel, Ifill asks the candidates \u2014 first, Sarah Palin, whose perceived weakness is her lack of experience. Palin's answer lands many hundreds of miles from Ifill's question \u2014 she's talking about her strengths, without even paying lip-service to the question. Brilliant, in a mad and appalling way. Biden at least answers the question, though he too turns it into self-aggrandisement. Fair enough \u2014 they're politicians.</p> <p><strong>10.22pm</strong>: Talking of his children and the car accident that killed his wife and daughter, Biden chokes up. (This is extremely popular with CNN's Ohio voters.)</p> <p><strong>10.24pm</strong>: Palin just said \"maverick\" three times, I think, in the space of a few seconds. This is, in itself, maverick. \"Let's talk about the maverick John McCain,\" Biden intervenes, hilariously. \"He's not been a maverick in providing healthcare for people... He's not been a maverick on the war... He's not been a maverick on virtually any of the things people talk about around their kitchen table... Maverick he is not.\"</p> <p><strong>10.26pm</strong>: Final question: \"Can you think of a single policy issue where you were forced to change a long-held view in order to accommodate changed circumstances?\" Biden gives a mildly obscure answer about changing his view about the importance of taking into account the judicial philosophies of court appointees. Palin says she might have \"quasi-caved-in\" by not vetoing budgets in Alaska. \"But on the major principle things, no... we've always seemed to find a way to work together up there in Alaska.\" And now a discussion on how completely excellent bipartisanship is.</p> <p><strong>10.29pm</strong>: Closing statements. \"I like being able to answer these tough questions without the filter of the mainstream media telling people what they've just heard,\" Palin says. Now she's talking about how important it is to keep fighting for freedom. \"There's only one man who has ever fought for you, and that's John McCain.\" Biden: We won't measure change by how much we deregulate and give perks to \"the Exxon Mobils of the world.\" \"My dad used to have an expression, he'd say, champ, when you get knocked down, get up. Well, it's time for America to get up together.\"</p> <p>That's it. The families flood the stage, including Sarah Palin's monumentally large number of children. </p> <p>Well \u2014 no major gaffes on either side. This debate, I suspect, won't be much of a \"game-changer\" in either direction, though of course all polls will prove me decisively wrong over the next 24 hours, as they did last time. Biden gave the far superior debate performance by any objective standard, of course; far superior to pretty much any recent debate I can call to mind. (He largely kept his critical focus on McCain, not Palin, and came off as amply respectful, too -- perhaps even a little admiring of Palin's spiritedness.) But of course all that may not be the relevant point: Palin didn't fall apart, and until discussion moved to foreign policy, at any rate, her relentless strategy of talking only about tax cuts and energy policy, peppering her lines with plenty of folksiness, seemed to serve her well. From the Iraq section onwards, she sometimes seemed to be clinging on by her fingertips. But she did cling on. </p> <p><strong>11pm</strong>: A few final thoughts, having consumed more punditry: might Palin's reference to having been in the job for only about five weeks have been a bad miscalculation? CNN's voter focus group seemed to think so. Palin meant it as a boast, of course -- but there's outsiderhood, and then there's outsiderhood. Also (to use Palin's favourite word), also: how wise was it to attack Biden for focusing on the Bush administration's errors, rather than putting distance between McCain/Palin and Bush? ...And how much will it matter who looked the more \"presidential\", given that this isn't a presidential debate? If it does matter, again, Biden will win without question. But I can't help thinking there's a conservative Republican base that's feeling fairly happy tonight, if only due to relief.
