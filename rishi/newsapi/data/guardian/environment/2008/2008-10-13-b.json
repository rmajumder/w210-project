  "<p>England will press the International Cricket Council to prove today that it retains credibility as the game's governing body by curbing the excesses of the Indian Premier League and imposing the official policy that Test cricket remains of paramount importance.</p> <p>It has not been a good month for naked capitalism but it continues unchecked as far as Indian cricket is concerned, as the IPL increasingly enforces divisive deals that could have huge repercussions for the game.</p> <p>Giles Clarke, the England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, is expected to use the ICC board meeting in Dubai to condemn Indian behind-the-scenes manoeuvrings which have left England's officially sanctioned Test series against Sri Lanka next May on the point of collapse and could force the total abandonment of May international cricket in England.</p> <p>The feeling in England is that if the ICC does not regain control of the game by enforcing an international calendar to suit all then, rather than make an impending move into luxurious new offices in Dubai's sports city, it might as well just turn out the lights.</p> <p>The ambition of Lalit Modi, the chairman of the IPL, has been underlined by confidential negotiations with Sri Lanka's sports ministry which, if confirmed, would virtually give the IPL a controlling stake in Sri Lanka cricket affairs. Discussions have centred upon a $70m (\u00a340m) guarantee to Sri Lanka Cricket over the next 10 years if they offer unconditional support for India's Twenty20 plans for the next decade - whatever they may be.</p> <p>That would make inevitable the growing likelihood that Sri Lanka's tour of England will be scrapped - even though Sri Lanka have signed a tour agreement and the ECB has received no official admission from Sri Lanka Cricket that the tour is off. Compensation is the least that the ECB would expect, but that does not address the issue of who runs the international game.</p> <p>England - for reasons not just of their own financial health, but the future integrity of the game - have refused to bow to India's every unpredictable whim, seemingly unlike Australia who have abandoned their oft-stated suspicion of Twenty20 and are now waving begging bowls with much enthusiasm. For the ECB it is a principled but lonely position.</p> <p>That leaves David Morgan, the ICC president and a former ECB chairman, facing the most daunting test of his administrative career today. For once, he has abandoned his emollient tone and condemned the IPL's proposed deal with Sri Lanka Cricket as \"quite unacceptable behaviour against the background of Sri Lanka's signed agreement with the ECB.\"</p> <p>Haroon Lorgat, the ICC's chief executive, has insisted upon \"Test cricket's primacy\". To date, however, both have been unable to exert control.</p> <p>One problem for the ECB is that it is not only the 13 Sri Lankan players who want to play IPL. Privately, several England players will be hoping that next summer's Sri Lanka tour collapses. Modi's aggressive scheduling of the IPL to clash with England's May Test series has also prevented sought-after England cricketers such as the captain, Kevin Pietersen, from maximising their IPL earnings.</p> <p>Although some England players expect to play in the IPL next spring, they will be allowed a fortnight at best in a competition that runs from April 10 to May 25. Tests against Sri Lanka are theoretically scheduled for May 7-11 at Lord's and May 15-19 at Chester-le-Street, followed by a three-match ODI series from May 24-30. </p> <p>Such is the financial glut in Indian cricket that there are no signs so far that the global crisis is about to affect them. The deal being discussed with Sri Lanka could soon be offered to Pakistan. The likely outcome therefore is that the ICC's Future Tours programme will be designed around whatever extravaganzas that India wants. If they are denied an official window in the international calendar they will just build a house of their own. </p> <p>Indian talk of ICC irrelevance is often followed by assertions that English cricket no longer matters. The way to change that perception is for England to soundly beat India this autumn and create a few superstars in the process. Never has success been more sorely needed.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday October 14 2008. Homophone corner: 'Clarke seeks to reign in Indian influence as ICC meets'. That should have been 'rein'. This has been changed.</p>",
  "<p>Retail sales in the UK fell for the sixth month in a row in September as consumers continued to tighten their belts in the midst of the credit crunch.</p> <p>The British Retail Consortium said like-for-like sales dropped 1.5% in the year to September, with furniture retailers suffering their worst performance for eight years despite continued discounts and promotions. </p> <p>Stephen Robertson, director general of the BRC, said: \"The financial turmoil has further undermined consumer confidence with like-for-like sales now down in six of the last seven months. Food and drink sales grew, with hard-pressed families focusing on value ranges.\" </p> <p>He said impulse buying was disappearing as people considered purchases carefully and sought out promotions. </p> <p>High-street retailers have had a difficult month. The sports chain JJB warned it could not guarantee its survival; the furnishing retailer Rosebys collapsed into administration, and John Lewis announced it was experiencing poor sales as a result of the economic crisis. </p> <p>The outlook is equally grim. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at the consultants Global Insight, said people had to cope with high food prices, rising utility bills and accelerating unemployment. \"Consumers will continue to face serious pressures for an extended period. In particular, the rise in unemployment looks set to accelerate, while the very sharp fall in equity prices will hit people's wealth and their pensions,\" he added. </p> <p>Food and drink was the only sector to show sales significantly up on a year ago. Clothing sales were down but furniture and home accessories were the worst sufferers. </p> <p>The real test for retail sales will be over the next few months, especially during the run-up to Christmas. </p> <p>\"Retailers will be hoping customers are willing and able to spend for Christmas as an antidote to the gloom,\" said Robertson. However, if the City's leading retail analysts are to be believed, the UK high street is heading for its worst festive season in 30 years.</p>",
  "<p>Bold and unprecedented bail-out plans for banks in Britain, Europe and the US brought markets back from the brink yesterday, after last week's turmoil knocked a fifth off the value of stockmarkets.</p> <p>Share prices rebounded around the world and frozen interbank lending markets showed some signs of thawing. The FTSE 100 recovered almost half of last week's losses to close 8.3% higher, up 325 points at 4,256.9. It was its second-biggest one-day percentage rise ever.</p> <p>The Dow Jones in New York closed up 11%, the largest daily jump in percentage terms since 1933 and the largest ever in terms of points, as dealers on both sides of the Atlantic said the financial world had stepped back from the brink of disaster - for now at least. \"It's not as if we've waved a magic wand, but we're on the road to building a greater period of stability,\" said Robert Talbut, chief investment officer of Royal London Asset Management.</p> <p>The resurgence in the markets followed the release in London and Europe of details of the multinational attempt to refloat the crippled banking system.</p> <p>The 15 members of the eurozone, led by Germany and France, unveiled large, coordinated plans along British lines to provide their banks with capital funding and guarantees to get them lending again and shore up investor confidence. The overall bill for the various national schemes across the EU could reach \u20ac2tn.</p> <p>In London, the government confirmed that RBS, HBOS, and Lloyds TSB will be partially nationalised after historic rescue agreements were hammered out with officials from the Treasury and FSA in the early hours of Monday morning. Gordon Brown promised that \u00a337bn of taxpayer funds being ploughed into the troubled banks would act as \"a rock of stability\", as he pledged a crackdown on City pay, and won assurances that none of the banks being rescued would pay bonuses to their bosses this year. \"In extraordinary times, with financial markets ceasing to work, the government cannot just leave people on their own to be buffeted about,\" Brown said. \"For savers, for small businesses, and for homeowners, we must, in an uncertain and unstable world, be the rock of stability on which the British people can depend.\"</p> <p>Five top bankers are leaving as a result of the taxpayer rescue, including HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby and Sir Fred Goodwin, the RBS chief executive. RBS, which is taking \u00a320bn from the government, is expected to be radically restructured.</p> <p>The taxpayer could end up owning nearly 60% of RBS and more than 43% of Lloyds TSB after its takeover of HBOS, but Alistair Darling insisted the government did not want to be \"in the business of running banks, we are in the business of stabilising banks - that is our purpose\".</p> <p>But the chancellor issued a wider attack on the quality of boardroom supervision saying: \"It is really quite extraordinary that boards themselves did not more fully understand what risks they were allowing their banks to become exposed to. The first line of defence, not just for shareholders but for everyone else, is to make sure boards are up to the job.\"</p> <p>Sentiment was helped by signs of coordinated action to ease the global crisis. Brown claimed Britain was the international leader: \"This is the first government to do what a large number of governments are going to do over the next few days\" .</p> <p>The three banks that are accepting the government handouts were among only six companies in the index to end lower on the day.</p> <p>In the US, where the government's original $700bn bail-out plan had failed to stabilise financial markets, treasury secretary Henry Paulson summoned the bosses of America's biggest banks to a meeting to discuss ways of the government taking stakes in troubled financial firms.</p> <p>But despite the calmer atmosphere in stockmarkets there were growing signs that the credit crisis has already damaged the UK economy. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reports today that the number of housing transactions has fallen to an all-time low, while the British Retail Consortium says shop sales have tumbled to their lowest for six months.</p> <p>Nationwide raised some of its mortgage rates in spite of the Bank of England's half-point interest rate cut last week.</p> <p>Opposition parties drew a line under their temporary support for the government's handling of the economic crisis. Amid warnings from experts that the national debt could quadruple as a result of the bank rescue, shadow chancellor George Osborne said the taxpayer was taking on debt equivalent to \u00a311,000 for every British family. \"It is the British people who have now been landed with the bill for the boom that turned to bust. Paid for by the biggest increase in debt by any peacetime government,\" he said.</p> <p>The UK Shareholders Association, a small shareholder body, also attacked the government. It said: \"This is a socialist leftwing agenda to get hold of the banks without paying anything like a realistic price for them.\"</p> <p>The Treasury is to set up a company to run RBS, Lloyds TSB and HBOS \"at arm's length\" from the government, with ministers not involved in day-to-day decisions. But it will appoint three directors to the RBS board and two to Lloyds TSB once it has taken over HBOS. Even so, the banks insisted that they would still make decisions \"on commercial terms\", despite making promises to keep lending to small businesses and homeowners.</p> <p>Unions doubted that government promises to clamp down on pay would be effective. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: \"We take the rather old-fashioned view that bankers, like the vast majority of people at work, should be paid a proper wage for doing a good job, and should not require bonuses to get up in the morning.\"</p>",
  "<p>Richard Murphy and John Christensen (The threat lying offshore, October 10) blame the global financial crisis on offshore financial centres, but their ritualistic sticking of pins in the voodoo doll they have fashioned to represent these centres is a triumph of superstition over reality. While inconvenient to Murphy and Christiansen, it is a matter of public record that reputable international financial centres such as the Cayman Islands uphold global standards on regulation, transparency and cross-border cooperation, and are able and reliable partners in the fight against financial crime.</p> <p>The repeated allegations of secrecy and lax regulation contribute nothing to the objective analysis of the root causes of, and solutions to, the current global financial turmoil. It is particularly odious for Murphy and Christiansen to suggest that \"tax havens\" revel in global instability and uncertainty, and are intent on thwarting and sabotaging efforts to restore order and confidence in the financial markets.</p> <p>The global community is rightly engaged in a review of the regulatory underpinnings of the financial markets, to ensure sound support for sustainable economic prosperity, security and stability. Reputable offshore financial centres, such as the Cayman Islands, have contributed to those objectives in the past and will do so for the future, in whatever shape that takes. <br><strong>Alden M McLaughlin </strong><br>Minister for international financial services policy, Cayman Islands government </p> <p>Roy Hattersley's memories of cod war negotiations in Reykjavik in 1975 (Comment, October 11) do not offer a satisfactory synopsis. The Icelanders who tried to negotiate with Hattersley found him overbearing, arrogant and threatening. The US ambassador in Reykjavik who watched the talks closely regarded him as \"a pompous, arrogant man perhaps eager for a fight\". So, perhaps Hattersley is not the best judge of why he failed to reach a satisfactory compromise with the Icelanders during the cod war - just as Gordon Brown will not be the best man to explain why he invoked anti-terrorist laws against Iceland. Maybe he was just also eager for a fight? If so, he chose a better moment than Hattersley. <br><strong>Gudni J\u00f3hannesson</strong><br>Reykjavik University </p> <p>Douglas Alexander should be congratulated for staring down the US in the tussle over the appointment of the presidency of the World Bank. It is unjustifiable that the job of running one of the world's most important global institutions should be in the gift of just one country. But this reform is just the beginning of making the bank fit for the modern world. The more important step is to reform the voting shares, so that developing countries which are most affected by the bank's policies have as much decision-making power as the rich countries that have traditionally dominated it.<br><strong>Dr Claire Melamed</strong><br>ActionAid UK</p>",
  "<p>Your article highlights the downside of single-mindedly pursuing the highest financial return (Lost in Iceland: \u00a31bn from councils, charities and police, October 10). For charities, in particular, this is an opportune time to re-examine the accepted wisdom of segregating the pursuit of charitable objectives from the management of financial assets. </p> <p>Instead of charities depositing their cash in a bank because it offers a titillating interest rate, what if they used their cash to also meet their charitable objectives? It is possible to earn a healthy interest rate by depositing funds in a bank with a capital adequacy ratio nearly double the mandatory minimum, with the knowledge (through full transparency) that deposits are only lent to organisations delivering positive social and environmental change. Now is the time for charities and foundations to demand more from their investment advisers, and make their money work harder by delivering social good as well as financial return. <br><strong>Whitni Thomas</strong><br>Investment manager, Triodos Bank </p> <p>Now that the government is set to take a controlling stake in RBS, it must ensure that some form of environmental as well as financial regulation takes place, and curb the billions of pounds that the bank has channelled into coal, oil and gas across the globe. RBS, which up until very recently styled itself as \"the oil and gas bank\", is the UK bank with the most emissions-intensive investment portfolio. Rather than simply writing a blank cheque, this bail-out should be conditional upon those banks which have benefited making a full disclosure of their fossil-fuel financing, as well as making a commitment to cap and reduce the carbon emissions embedded in their investments and loans. We have seen what happens when financial risks are concealed from the market. We must ensure that carbon risks are open and accountable.</p> <p>For the first time in living memory, the government has the potential to have a direct say in the lending behaviour of banks like RBS, and that opportunity should be used to take us down the path of climate as well as economic stability.<br><strong>Duncan McLaren </strong>Friends of the Earth Scotland, <strong>Mel Evans </strong>Platform, <strong>Bronwen Smith-Thomas</strong> People &amp; Planet, <strong>Jeni Mackay </strong>Scottish Education and Action for Development, <strong>Johan Frijns</strong> BankTrack, <strong>Geoff Nettleton </strong>Indigenous People's Links</p> <p>Yesterday's meeting between Iraq's oil minister, Hussain al-Shahristani, and oil giants Shell, BP and ExxonMobil (Report, October 13) should be a timely warning to all those who opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Backed by the occupying powers, big oil has long been pushing hard for highly exploitative contracts that would cede them extensive control over the future of Iraq's oil.</p> <p>In 2002, future Iraqi oil minister Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum enthusiastically described the then looming occupation as both a \"sort of life insurance for continuing the social and political changes\" and \"a great incentive for attracting the international oil companies\". And so it has proved to be. On the one hand, the occupation helps the US to shape Iraqi politics in its own interests, especially on oil policy. On the other, the oil companies want US forces to remain to defend their operations. The anti-war movement should take action now to help ensure that no long-term contracts are signed while Iraq remains under foreign occupation.<br><strong>Gabriel Carlyle</strong><br>Voices UK</p> <p>I thought we might have a chance of survival yesterday, that it might be Gordon Brown's Churchillian moment, and he might lead us and the world out of this crisis with social democracy and sensible regulation of power.

  "<p>A year after Fiona Sellers, 39, sold her headhunting business she decided she wanted to retrain as an interior designer. \"I've always been addicted to interiors magazines and part of me wanted to do something creative,\" she says.</p> <p>Sellers, from Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, needed to study design, but with two young children, she decided to look into distance learning. \"I spent a while doing internet research, and came across Inchbald school. I was impressed by the website - it was well designed, with plenty of interaction,\" she says.</p> <p>Sellers signed up to a two-year \"fast track\" interior design online course.

  "<h2>Out of Dragons' Den, into the tycoon academy</h2> <p>Peter Jones is still sounding as excited as - well, as a contestant who has just coaxed serious cash out of him or one of his fellow judges on Dragons' Den.</p> <p>The Learning and Skills Council has just officially approved his proposal for the first national enterprise academy.</p> <p>Passing on the secrets of his success had become almost an obsession for a number of years before the government began talking about skills academies.</p> <p>\"It was when I started writing a book four years ago about my own goals and aspirations that I realised I wanted to open a 'tycoon academy',\" he says.</p> <p>There are plans to open two enterprise academies next September; one in Buckinghamshire, one in Manchester. </p> <p>But Jones doesn't want to wait a year. Next month he is launching a \"pilot\" academy for 35 16- to 19-year-olds at Amersham College, which will open in January and run for six months. Applications for the pilot academy can be made now via www.peterjones.tv.</p> <p>For the past four months, Jones has been relentlessly writing a curriculum for the academies, which he says is nearly ready. He is determined that it will be taught by real entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Upwards of 200 students will be signed up for the 12-month courses at the two premises next September. </p> <p>They will come out with a qualification of enterprise, which he hopes will be a valuable currency. They will also get the chance of industry experience.</p> <p>\"And those who manage to get distinctions are likely to get funding to start their own business.\"</p> <p>There will be no tuition fees to pay, as more than \u00a335m has been raised for the venture. Jones accepts that for youngsters far from Buckinghamshire or Manchester, attending either is quite an undertaking. That is partly the reason for rolling out the course for other institutions to teach across the country. </p> <p>\"Over the next three to five years, we will have reached some 13,000 young people.\"</p> <h2>Harry Potter and the revival of Latin</h2> <p>Has someone cast a spell that can bring dead languages back to life? The number of schools offering Latin as an option has more than doubled in Britain in the past three years. And now Latin is making a surprise resurgence in American schools too. </p> <p>Over the past 10 years the number of students taking America's national Latin exam has increased by a third, while the number taking the advanced placement test (at sixth form level) in the subject has nearly doubled. The growth has happened in remote parts of the US such as Vermont, Alaska and New Mexico, as well as across New York city, where Latin is now taught in more than 30 schools. The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages predicts it may overtake German as the third most popular language after Spanish and French. So why are so many opting to learn a language that won't help you order paella or croissants?</p> <p>\"There are a few reasons,\" says Mark McWilliams, who teaches Latin at Isaac E Young middle school in New Rochelle, New York. \"Some academically advanced students want a challenge, to take the most difficult classes; some like learning the culture, mythology and religion, which are a part of the curriculum; some students don't do so well with the spoken part of modern languages, so with Latin they can learn a language without having to do that. Others just think it's different, and why not?\"</p> <p>One school of thought suggests that the rise of Latin in popular culture - Harry Potter's spells, films like Troy and Gladiator - prompts students to take it up. McWilliams agrees that this \"gives a brief uptick in interest\". But he thinks this \"only plays a minor part\". Megan Thomas, a 13-year-old Harry Potter fan who's had after-school Latin classes for a year, disagrees. \"It's kinda nice to understand the spells - she puts jokes in them,\" she says of JK Rowling's incantations. </p> <p>McWilliams sees other reasons for starting Latin. \"It's a solid foundation for most languages, and it gives you a rigorous grasp of grammar now English is not taught as formally as it used to be. And if any Latin students want to study something else later, they'll begin with a solid foundation in how a language works.\"<br><strong>Ravi Somaiya</strong></p> <h2>What we have learned this week</h2> <p>Confidence in British universities wobbled slightly last week as shares and markets crashed around us, although they still look a good investment - but will taxpayers keep investing in them? The Times Higher/QS global league showed that 22 of the 29 British universities in the top 200 in the world have moved down the table in the past year, but that still leaves 17 UK institutions in the top 100. Compare that with Germany's three or France's two (though Switzerland, with three, and the Netherlands, with four, do better in a table the compilers admit is biased towards academic publication in English). </p> <p>Both the Russell Group of big research-led institutions and the University and College Union used the results to remind the government about the need to match growing overseas competition when it comes to funding higher education. The fact that Hong Kong has three universities in the top 50 and Singapore two is a portent of things to come. </p> <p>There was to be no second chance for the Rev Tim Hastie-Smith, the public-school head who gave a second chance to a teacher by employing him even though it was known that he had secretly filmed a pupil having sex. First came the announcement from Kettering academy, the state school Hastie-Smith was about to take charge of amid considerable fanfare, that the offer was withdrawn. Then came the news that he had resigned as chair of the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) - the club of leading independent schools - and then quit early as master of Dean Close school, Cheltenham. It was a spectacular fall from grace. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Oxford and Cambridge took their rivalry into iTunesU, the academic section of the online music store. By Friday, Oxford's release of Joseph Stiglitz's topical and catchy explanation of the credit crunch was up there in the top 20. Cambridge is hitting back with a weekly radio show from Chris Smith and the Naked Scientists.<br><strong>Donald MacLeod</strong></p>",
  "<p>Alistair Darling was reportedly furious when he woke from a rare full night's sleep two weeks ago to hear that while he had been dreaming, Ireland had guaranteed deposits in all its six banks. The chancellor phoned Brian Lenihan, Ireland's finance minister, to ask why he hadn't been told. After a night in which he had rung his cabinet ministers between 1.30am and 2am and squeezed in two hours' sleep before then phoning EU financiers at dawn, Lenihan reportedly explained there had been no time.</p> <p>We can safely assume that \"I didn't want to disturb your beauty sleep\" was not part of Lenihan's explanation. It is not jobs, merchant banks or Iceland that have been the first casualties of the economic turmoil; it is sleep. Darling has enjoyed less than most. After last Tuesday's all-nighter with at least 30 Treasury officials, during which he grabbed some sleep between 1.40am and 4.50am, he was in Washington over the weekend to meet the G7 and the IMF, adding jetlag to sleep deprivation when he flew back to attend another banking bailout emergency meeting at the Treasury that ended at 2am yesterday. It is not just politicians who are suffering: Tom Scholar, a senior Treasury civil servant, reportedly managed to fit in only two hours' sleep in a 48-hour period ahead of last week's bailout meeting.</p> <p>This lack of sleep demonstrates the magnitude of the crisis, and to have people talking about it is useful for politicians as a demonstration of their determination and dedication. Many of the meetings have been held through the night because measures had to be devised, agreed upon and announced in the window between the UK stock market closing and opening, in an attempt to minimise volatility and panic selling. This is a global crisis and the markets never sleep, observers nod sagely. And at the moment, their masters must not either.</p> <p>Some might grumble that late-night meetings may show inefficient succombing to an old-fashioned macho working culture. But, in this crisis, putting work before sleep is logical, and according to the experts, logic is not something that disappears from the minds of the sleep-deprived. Working on an all-night session, people can still think logically, says Professor Jim Horne, director of the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University, but they are unable to sustain more high-level thinking, such as being able to deal with the unexpected, respond creatively and flexibly to new situations and come up with innovative solutions - exactly what you might assume this unprecedented economic turmoil would require. Without any sleep, people are also more likely to unthinkingly comply - hence the all-night meetings of management versus unions of old - and also take risks. \"Part of the brain that tells you to be careful is knocked out. That may be why casinos stay open all night. People's ability to perceive risk is ignored,\" he says.</p> <p>Everyone knows that if we don't get enough sleep we make mistakes. More people are killed on Britain's roads through sleep-related accidents than alcohol-related accidents. Tired people make tragic mistakes. The Chernobyl nuclear accident, the space shuttle Challenger disaster, the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the Selby rail crash have all been attributed to human errors in which sleep deprivation played a part.</p> <p>Scientific experiments have shown that sleep- deprived drivers underestimate their degree of sleepiness - believing they are more awake than they actually are when put in a stimulating situation. In this way, says Colin Espie, director of the University of Glasgow Sleep Centre, our judgment is clouded and we overestimate our ability to get things done. Sleep-deprived people may believe they are working effectively because they feel they are putting in so much effort, but in reality they are putting more effort in precisely because they are sleep-deprived and their brains are not functioning so effectively. As Espie points out, working on an all-nighter decreases efficiency not just through sleep deprivation but by forcing us to be awake at a time when our bodies are shutting down and our circadian rhythms (or body clock) are telling us we should be asleep.</p> <p>From the late-night sessions in the House of Commons to Winston Churchill's five hours a night - topped up with a daily nap - there is a long tradition of sleeplessness in politics. Margaret Thatcher famously claimed to thrive on four hours a night. Gordon Brown does much the same even when not beset by a global slump. The No 10 press officer gave the irritable response of the sleep-deprived to my inquiries - clearly seeing sleep as a frivolous matter - but insiders say the prime minister goes to bed around 11.30pm on a normal night and rises to begin firing off emails around 4.30am. It is said he finds this the most productive time of the day, not least because he is not usually disturbed by officials. (If he was to sleep in any longer he would in any case still get woken up before 6am, which is when his two-year-old son, Fraser, currently rises in the Brown household.)</p> <p>This may not be a recipe for catastrophically impaired decision-making and is at least better than staying up all night. \"If Gordon Brown is doing that he is a very sensible man,\" says Horne. \"If his officials are up all night they are more likely to be making mistakes.\"</p> <p>The notion of a solid eight hours' sleep a night is a relatively recent western construct and before the 19th century there is evidence that we slept in two short shifts, divided by a period of wakeful thinking time around 1am. Horne gives short shrift to the idea that 24/7 capitalism is suffering a crisis of sleeplessness and we are all getting less than we used to: the working classes got far less in the Victorian era of 14-hour days and sharing beds in overcrowded and noisy conditions, he argues. The notion that we all need a solid eight hours' sleep is also simplistic: children and young people need more; many older people need less, and sleep requirements are often a personal thing.</p> <p>But the 21st-century response to lack of sleep is often to seek to master it with technology - propping ourselves up with artificial stimulants such as coffee or exercise, which only defer the need for sleep. One banker embroiled in the crisis meetings says he has been staying awake with weak tea. But caffeine is not fuel for the mind. Nor, for the record, is the karahi lamb and aloo gobi personally ordered by Darling from his favourite curry house during last week's epic bailout meeting.</p> <p>\"The ability of coffee to overcome those more subtle effects of a lack of sleep is limited,\" says Horne. \"There is no substitute for sleep.\" Unlike physical muscles, the brain cannot be refreshed and recharged through rest; it requires sleep and Horne's research shows that without at least four hours' sleep, the frontal area of the brain that looks after those complex executive functions such as responding creatively to unexpected circumstances is unable to function effectively.</p> <p>\"Daytime meetings would seem to be advisable for dealing with international crises,\" says Colin Espie. Failing that, politicians should at least be trying to catch up on their sleep with a power nap: even 30 minutes can make a difference, and naps are particularly effective because they can recharge the brain with the most useful kind of deep sleep we only usually experience for a portion of an ordinary night. Unfortunately, Churchill apart, napping in the office tends to be frowned upon and is still seen as an admission weakness.</p> <p>\"We're very familiar with the public health message - eat well, exercise, everything in moderation - and we seem to have forgotten that sleep is the primary factor that delivers quality of life. It's the one thing you can't do without,\" says Espie. \"The danger is we treat sleep as a commodity that you spend when you like, but it doesn't work that way. We're not in charge of it.\"</p> <p>As Espie explains, sleep deprivation is often defined by its consequences. But maybe it's too hopeful to think the current turmoil and our apparent inability to control it could all be sorted out with a good night's kip.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 24 December 2008 to correct the homophone; \"Without any sleep, people are also more likely to unthinkingly comply - hence the all-night meetings of management verses unions of old - and also take risks\".</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown certainly thinks so. Yesterday it was reported that the prime minister will shortly be moving his team into 12 Downing Street, where there is room to create a large shared space that will reflect his famously relaxed personality and laid-back working style.</p> <p>The idea of putting staff together in one big room is as old as the office itself. Certainly it seems to be the way that most journalists, for example, have always worked. The concept of providing non-allocated desks, however, is much more modern, with roots in Europe in the 1970s. Also known as \"hotdesking\", the practice is now common in Scandinavia.</p> <p>But could such an open working environment help to improve a flagging government's performance? \"Absolutely, yes,\" says Alex Redgrave, head of consulting at HOK, a design firm that has helped the Guardian, among others, to plan its new office. \"It's all to do with trying to persuade people to move around the office, meet colleagues and exchange ideas. You'd have thought No 10 would have done that a long time ago to cut out all the little secret phone calls that must go on.\"</p> <p>Even so, senior staff who have been turfed out of their offices can be slow to adjust to perching on a stool with their laptop. And with this in mind, Brown himself must take the lead. \"It is normally important,\" says Richard Leyland, head of knowledge at the Cordless Group, a workplace consultancy, \"that the guy at the top is also seen to be working in these flexible spaces, because employees are hypersensitive to this idea that they're losing their status.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, for more delicate tasks, Brown will need at least one private meeting room he can call on. \"You don't hire and fire in an environment where other people can hear the conversation,\" says Leyland bluntly. The next reshuffle should be fun.</p>",
  "<p>The Sandinista government has launched a sweeping crackdown on non-governmental organisations, including Oxfam, prompting concerns about freedom of speech and democratic rights. </p> <p>Police raided the offices of two pressure groups, carting away computers and files, and a further 15 organisations are under investigation for alleged money-laundering and subversion.</p> <p>Critics condemned the move as a further sign of intolerance and authoritarianism by President Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista leader who was feted as a hero in the country's 1980s revolution.</p> <p>Several European governments are preparing to axe tens of millions of dollars in aid in protest, a sign of how much international support Ortega has lost since his return to power last year. \"It's a response to the deteriorating democratic environment,\" said one diplomat in the capital, Managua.</p> <p>Last month the government launched Operation No More Lies against NGOs it accused of embezzlement, money-laundering and subversion. Their promotion of human rights, gender equality and poverty reduction were \"modern-day trojan horses\" and a rightwing plot to destabilise the administration, it said. The interior ministry followed up with an inquiry into 17 groups, including Oxfam GB, the British branch of the aid agency. It is one of the biggest NGOs in Nicaragua and runs several programmes as well as distributing donor funds to local NGOs. </p> <p>A judicial order to confiscate documents and equipment, which the Guardian has seen, names Oxfam as one of the groups to be raided. The agency pre-empted the raid by handing over material before police broke in.</p> <p>\"We are surprised and concerned by the allegations that have appeared in the media about Oxfam's operations in Nicaragua,\" said Barbara Stocking, the group's chief executive. \"For over 30 years we have respected Nicaraguan law, and carried out our work to overcome poverty and suffering in a transparent, accountable and non-partisan way.\" Oxfam would cooperate with any investigation, she added.</p> <p>Privately, officials from several other aid agencies questioned whether they could work in the western hemisphere's second-poorest country after Haiti. </p> <p>The government has defended its actions as a lawful attempt to control murky funding for opposition-linked local NGOs. Officials did not return calls.</p> <p>Ortega paved his return to power by endorsing a ban on abortion, which appeased the Catholic church, and neutralising conservative foes with a pact.</p> <p>Some of his most vocal critics have been former supporters who accused him of betraying Sandinista principles, a chorus which swelled as the president clashed with writers, poets and artists who had championed the movement during its war against US-backed Contra rebels. </p> <p>Violent attacks by pro-government supporters on recent opposition rallies have further dented the president's image.</p> <p>The focus of the crackdown is the Centre of Media Investigations (Cinco) and its head, Carlos Fernando Chamorro, a high-profile journalist and son of a former president, Violeta Chamorro. His investigations into alleged corruption in Sandinista land deals infuriated the government.</p> <p>The other group raided was the Autonomous Movement for Women (Mam), which has criticised the treatment of women.</p> <p>\"The administrative and judicial harassment of Cinco and Mam is an outrage,\" said the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders. Courts were being used to settle scores and attack civil society, it said.</p>",
  "<p>The users' forum on the Betfair betting exchange is not to everyone's taste. If some internet racing forums resemble a genteel discussion of matters of state in a Victorian drawing room, Betfair's can be more like a riot in the Coliseum. Some contributors like to think of themselves as Caesar, while others never tire of adding their voice to the raucous background noise. More tender souls, meanwhile, could well end up as lion food. </p> <p>But the Betfair forum is also by far the largest and most lively aggregation of racing fans and gamblers anywhere on the web. It has been an important part of the exchange's appeal almost from its launch eight years ago, a way to advertise the person-to-person basis of the site and increase the sense of community. </p> <p>Like any community, of course, it has its share of members with personality disorders: the bullies, the fantasists and barefaced liars, and the ones with such deep-seated anger-management issues that they should probably be under lock and key. But there are many others, too, who just want to talk punting with like-minded souls, and to do so in a forum where an honest opinion can be expressed, and even the odd insult hurled, without the sky falling in. </p> <p>That, at least, is how it has always been, and those who didn't like it could easily surf off elsewhere. As of yesterday, though, the barbed wire may have started to fence off the wild frontier. </p> <p>In a move which screams \"float\" even more plainly than the recent imposition of \"premium charges\" for some of its most successful clients, the responsibility for Betfair's forum has been hived off to a different part of the group - TSE Global Limited - with some important new procedures in place for forum users. </p> <p>In particular, it will now be much easier to \"report\" other users (or at any rate, it will when the new forum actually works, since yesterday's launch survived for barely an hour before it crashed). This can only lead to the fairly rapid sanitisation of the entire forum. </p> <p>Which is no bad thing, many would say. For anyone who has watched and admired Betfair's growth into a betting phenomenon, though, it follows the premium charge as the latest sign of the exchange's rapid corporatisation. </p> <p>The punters who came together to make Betfair what it is are now just a means to an end, specifically a chunky share price when it floats. The forum, meanwhile, is a bit of an embarrassment. </p> <p>Even Ben &amp; Jerry sold out in the end, so the clear urge of Betfair's founders to spend more time with their money is both understandable and thoroughly well-earned. But when they are gone, what will remain? </p> <p>This is surely the most intriguing question of all for punters who love the value and flexibility that exchange betting provides. Betfair's premium charge, remember, was apparently introduced because a small number of winners were felt to be draining too much money from the site's losers. Despite the dreadful PR, the money was required to keep the losers coming. </p> <p>There must have been some good reason to allow their few rivals, along with many of their own customers, to kick them all over the park, and this one seems as plausible as any. </p> <p>If Betfair had had a worthwhile competitor in the marketplace, though, it would never have dared to risk the loss of its precious liquidity. This, in turn, implies that its long-term viability may depend on the preservation of its effective monopoly in the market. </p> <p>Now try this for a leap of logic. If a business model requires a monopoly to stop its customers eating it from within, then it is possible to argue that in the long term, it is a business model that doesn't work - which would be a good reason to cash in right now. </p> <p>The graphs and projections at Betfair HQ no doubt suggest otherwise. It is arguable too that at some point in its expansion, it was inevitable that Betfair would want to draw a line under its humble beginnings and stride on into a shiny new profit-maximising future. Sadly, an edgy, rough-house internet forum probably has no place in that.</p>",
  "<p>Apprenticeships are no longer a model for vocational education and training, but have become just another scheme for meeting government targets for stay-on rates and qualifications, according to a study funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. </p> <p>Like the new diplomas, apprenticeships are viewed by the government as a high-quality vocational option for all 14- to 19-year-olds in school, college or the workplace. It boldly announced, earlier this year, that numbers in England would be boosted from 243,000 to 400,000 by 2010. The figure would include 30,000 extra places for adults aged over 25.</p> <p>However, Professors Alison Fuller of Southampton University and Lorna Unwin of the Institute of Education warn that such expansion is of little value unless ministers stop interfering with the design and content of apprenticeships and adopt a more realistic partnership approach with employers and training providers. </p> <p>They say the central problem is that apprenticeships in England are a government-led model that started out with the best of intentions but has resulted in an increasingly narrow education and training offer for young people and adults seeking improvement.</p> <p>Their analysis is challenged by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Dius), whose spokesperson said that top-quality apprenticeships would be available to all who want them. </p> <p>According to Fuller and Unwin's research, carried out for the Teaching and Learning Research Programme, politicians have been distorting apprenticeships to meet short-term policy objectives ever since the Conservatives created modern apprenticeships (MA) in 1993.</p> <p>In their report, Towards Expansive Apprenticeships: A Commentary by the Teaching and Learning Research Programme, Fuller and Unwin say the best UK apprenticeships mirror the approach of the dual system in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. But, too often, they are just another scheme for meeting government targets. \"In recent years, apprenticeships' core identity as a model for learning has been replaced by that of a policy instrument. In that sense, apprenticeship is currently government owned and directed. This change has to be reversed.\"</p> <h2>Dual status</h2> <p>The researchers reckoned the best apprenticeships offered trainees dual status - of worker and learner, with access to a range of company departments, planned time off for college attendance and a clear career pathway. </p> <p>Since 1993, when MAs were created as A-level equivalent qualifications, they have been regarded positively by Ofsted. But inspectors have had concerns, such as the lack of a standard number of years for training apprentices, and the failure to guarantee time off the job for wider vocational education.</p> <p>In 2001, Labour introduced foundation and advanced apprenticeships with many elements of the German and other dual schemes. A technical certificate replaced the NVQ. However, five years later, the government removed this \"fundamental principle\", says the report. Apprenticeships no longer had to include a technical certificate or to guarantee any off-the-job training. </p> <p>Apprenticeships have not changed gender recruitment stereotypes, according to the research, or raised achievement levels in the traditional trades. Though apprenticeships in new technical and IT trades, accountancy and other professions can be A-level equivalent and higher, study for traditional trades such as construction and hairdressing is pitched largely at GCSE-equivalent qualifications.</p> <p>Dius points out that demand from young people for apprenticeships is increasing. \"Last year, 184,000 people started an apprenticeship, up from 75,000 in 1997, with completion rates at an all time high,\" said the spokesperson.</p> <p>Payment by results within a rigid time scale leaves little incentive for employers or training organisations to go beyond offering youngsters an NVQ and what are now called \"key\" or \"functional\" skills, say Unwin and Fuller. \"The attainment of specific and controversial qualification outcomes takes precedence over everything else, minimising the much more important process elements of an apprenticeship programme.\"</p> <p>The people involved in organising and teaching apprenticeships are not sufficiently involved in decisions about the \"apprenticeship blueprint\" that outlines details of each training programme, says the report. \"In our view this has prevented the creation of a model which has vocational learning at its heart.\"</p> <h2>Apprenticeship review</h2> <p>Unwin and Fuller believe that the apprenticeship review carried out this year goes some way to extending the scope of the blueprint. \"But it emerged from government without the involvement of providers, employers and awarding bodies.\"</p> <p>Their report recommends there should be an apprenticeship blueprint that is legally underpinned, and more investment in vocational education. Qualifications should extend from GCSE to degree level and apprenticeships should be in the Ucas system for university admissions. Careers staff should be given training so they understand apprenticeships better. And employers should provide properly monitored quality education and training and make sure apprentices maintain the dual identity of worker and learner.</p> <p>\"We are committed to ensuring that apprenticeships remain attractive, flexible and of high quality, which is precisely why we continue to work with employers in areas such as the accreditation of their own qualifications and reducing bureaucracy,\" says the Dius spokesperson. \"Our draft apprenticeships bill will take this work further with a new National Apprenticeship Service working with employers to further expand and improve opportunities.</p> <p>\"Our policy on apprenticeships is driven by our long-term aims to boost the skills of the nation's workforce in order to ensure we stay economically successful in an increasingly competitive global market.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Simon Richards <br>Teacher, south Wales </h2> <p>I don't think it's surprising that a new survey shows boys do better with male primary teachers. I've worked in primary schools that have no male teachers at all, but a lot of boys do seem to behave better with a male teacher. I'm not sure of the reasons. Maybe they come from backgrounds with no male role model, or simply feel they can connect better; it's important to have someone to talk to. This isn't just about getting more men to train. When they finish, there are very few jobs in certain areas. That's a major barrier. Also, a primary school is seen as a very feminine environment. Perhaps men feel they wouldn't have the disciplinary control that they would have at secondary level. And then there's the pay: if you were in charge of 30 people elsewhere, you'd earn a lot more than you do as a primary school teacher. Parents' attitudes also have to change. I've taught in nursery and reception, and I think parents feel a little uneasy about having a man teaching their children when they're very young.</p> <h2>TJ Taylor <br>Aged 16, Barnsley </h2> <p>When I was at primary school, we didn't have any male teachers, but we did have a semi-permanent one who came in when teachers were away, and everyone looked forward to him coming into the classroom. I think it's incredibly important to have male teachers, as boys appreciate having a man around. Men have authority over boys, especially rougher boys, and boys need role models in primary school, rather than all the male teachers being in secondary schools. A few months ago, I went back to help out at my primary school because my mum works there. They have a male teacher now and all the pupils look up to him so much, which was interesting. Last year, I helped out at the after-school club and I think the boys related to me more than to my mum. Teaching appeals to me and if I went in for it, I might go for primary teaching, but I'd be specialising in drama so I might be better off at secondary level. I went in to help with a primary school production and it was very satisfying, but I think it might have been even more so with older pupils.</p> <h2>Michele Harrison <br>Parent, London</h2> <p>I definitely think it's important to have male teachers at primary level. My son's primary has quite a few, he's lucky - over the past two or three years the numbers have been creeping up. But my older son, who's just moved on to secondary, never had a male teacher. He says he wishes he had, because they're easier to talk to. He really enjoyed having a male teaching assistant. He says that men are good role models; his words, not mine. He also says that more male primary teachers would encourage more boys into teaching. From the sports point of view, men tend to be the ones who will play football and do fun things with the boys. My son's primary has just set up a tag rugby team, which he thinks is great. The school has become more sporty, and I don't know if it's coincidence, but it has happened since more male teachers came in. How to encourage more men into primary teaching is a really hard question. I think it has to be an education process whereby men need to feel that what they're doing is worthwhile and can really make a difference. They need to be told that boys really need them, and that they are good role models for girls too.</p>",
  "<p>As the all-conquering prime minister arrived at Canary Wharf to address the City, the great glass towers of finance had stopped shaking in fear and all eyes were on the electronic ticker, watching every share rise up, up, up. How did it feel to be proclaimed saviour of the world? Wellington at Waterloo, Churchill on VE day? </p> <p>Later the wires blazed that Paul Krugman, New York Times economist, anti-Bush whistleblower on this bubble, had won the Nobel economics prize. What had he written yesterday? \"Gordon Does Good\" in a paean of surprised praise. This is about as good as it gets for a prime minister, so savour the day. Brown may yet win his niche in history as chancellor to the world.</p> <p>But before it goes to his head, winning back hearts and minds at home in the long, unhappy recession ahead is still to be done. Blogs and emails hiss with more fury at past errors than praise for his financial and political acumen now. Exactly a year ago Brown was addressing these same Canary Wharf City folk, introducing Alan Greenspan with effulgent and obsequious admiration, though already by then the laissez-faire former Federal Reserve chairman was widely fingered as the man responsible for the credit crisis. </p> <p>Remember when Warren Buffet, George Soros and Felix Rohatyn, the world's canniest investors, warned against derivatives as \"hydrogen bombs\"? Greenspan defended them against all scrutiny, calling them \"an extraordinarily useful vehicle to transfer risk\". As yesterday's Herald Tribune recalls, he claimed financial institutions were now \"less vulnerable to shocks from underlying risk factors\" because the whole financial system \"has become more resilient\". Only a year ago Gordon Brown listed Greenspan as a mentor.</p> <p>The trouble for Brown is that a year may be an eternity in politics, but in the real world people have longer memories. As recession bites, they will, for example, point to his adulatory Mansion House speech to the City last year, laced with hyperbole that must make him blush now: \"I congratulate you on these remarkable achievements, an era that history will record as the beginning of a new golden age for the City of London ... I believe it will be said of this age, the first decades of the 21st century, that out of the greatest restructuring of the global economy, perhaps even greater than the industrial revolution, a new world order was created.\" </p> <p>Yes indeed it was a new world order. It began with Margaret Thatcher's big bang deregulation and now it has nearly brought the world's economy crashing to destruction. It was a new world order of ballooning borrowing beyond the wildest imaginings of any previous era. Under Brown's stewardship, British citizens were allowed to over-borrow more than anyone in the world, more even than Americans, in a house price and credit card bubble of horrifying dimensions. This is no revelation, no secret. Many, many were the unheeded Cassandras calling out warnings.</p> <p>But because there can always be redemption, he can recover from that ill-judged infatuation with airy financial constructs built on under-taxed greed. He may be the hero of this hour but ultimately that redemption depends on how \"saved\" the economy really is. Brown's defibrillator worked, but a couple of grim years in intensive care lie ahead, with more shocks to come as more toxic debts still lurk. </p> <p>Yesterday in forceful terms Brown spelled out his reforms - no bank bonuses this year, no dividends while the government holds shares, an attempt at global regulation of cash and risk flowing across borders. Crucially, banks must lend at 2007 levels. But here's the key sentence: \"It has always been said of the City 'My word is my bond'. And that is the trust that must underpin everything we do in future.\"</p> <p>Brown himself can only regain lost trust if he realises quite what a monumental task that is, for him as well as for finance. That means far more than simply getting the City back on its feet, dusting down its worst excrescences and lopping off a few bank managers' heads (with their multimillion pensions intact). It will take more radical action and more resonant language.</p> <p>Alas, his committee of advisers consists of the City people who got us into this: the takers of the fattest pay, the sitters on each others' boards. Paul Myners, late of the Guardian, will be no radical steam cleaner as City minister, more of a feather duster. Brown needs a severe committee of those economists who were right when he was wrong - people to frighten the City, not to soothe its frightened feathers. Appoint the Richard Murphys, Will Huttons and Larry Elliotts not as City tsars but as City Savonarolas to flush out tax avoidance and evasion, to close down tax havens, to appoint honest non-executives to company boardrooms and institute a regime built on public trust. Corporate social responsibility will always be a sham for as long as share price is companies' only measure of success.</p> <p>Public trust is hard to earn and it takes bold gestures of honesty: start by driving large donations out of politics. Trust can be built by restraining obscene pay, when some predict 2 million unemployed by Christmas. Today's Incomes Data Services annual review finds directors' pay \"continues to defy gravity\". FTSE 100 CEOs' pay rose 11.5% this year, averaging \u00a33.5m, unabashed by share price falls. Even FTSE mid-250 CEOs earned \u00a31.5m, a 10.4% increase \"as more and more employees risk losing their jobs\". In a chastened City, it's time to abolish bonuses altogether, not just this year. Trust depends on Gordon Brown changing that culture, but when I asked him yesterday, his reforms sounded modest. But this is the one great chance to cleanse Britain's reputations as Europe's offshore haven with its wink-and-a-nod approach to greed and borderline tax dodging. The boot is at last on the government's foot and this is a once-in-a-century chance to restore \"My word is my bond\" trust.</p> <p>Remorse is too much to ask, but Brown has the chance to redeem himself on every front now. He, the eurosceptic who shunned the public signing of the Lisbon treaty, must be first to call for EU harmonisation of a minimum corporation tax to stop the race to the bottom started by Ireland to steal companies from each other. He who under-taxed the top must be first to say the richest 1% must pay towards easing hardship in this crisis. Trust is earned through bravery - and now we shall see if Brown has found the courage he has often lacked.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>This is nothing. Well, nothing by comparison to what's coming. The financial crisis for which we must now pay so heavily prefigures the real collapse, when humanity bumps against its ecological limits.</p> <p>As we goggle at the fluttering financial figures, a different set of numbers passes us by. On Friday, Pavan Sukhdev, the Deutsche Bank economist leading a European study on ecosystems, reported that we are losing natural capital worth between $2 trillion and $5 trillion every year as a result of deforestation alone. The losses incurred so far by the financial sector amount to between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion. Sukhdev arrived at his figure by estimating the value of the services - such as locking up carbon and providing fresh water - that forests perform, and calculating the cost of either replacing them or living without them. The credit crunch is petty when compared to the nature crunch.</p> <p>The two crises have the same cause. In both cases, those who exploit the resource have demanded impossible rates of return and invoked debts that can never be repaid. In both cases we denied the likely consequences. I used to believe that collective denial was peculiar to climate change. Now I know that it's the first response to every impending dislocation.</p> <p>Gordon Brown, for instance, was as much in denial about financial realities as any toxic debt trader. In June last year, during his Mansion House speech, he boasted that 40% of the world's foreign equities are now traded here. The financial sector's success had come about, he said, partly because the government had taken \"a risk-based regulatory approach\". In the same hall three years before, he pledged that \"in budget after budget I want us to do even more to encourage the risk takers\". Can anyone, surveying this mess, now doubt the value of the precautionary principle?</p> <p>Ecology and economy are both derived from the Greek word oikos - a house or dwelling. Our survival depends on the rational management of this home: the space in which life can be sustained. The rules are the same in both cases. If you extract resources at a rate beyond the level of replenishment, your stock will collapse. That's another noun which reminds us of the connection. The Oxford English Dictionary gives 69 definitions of \"stock\". When it means a fund or store, the word evokes the trunk - or stock - of a tree, \"from which the gains are an outgrowth\". Collapse occurs when you prune the tree so heavily that it dies. Ecology is the stock from which all wealth grows.</p> <p>The two crises feed each other. As a result of Iceland's financial collapse, it is now contemplating joining the European Union, which means surrendering its fishing grounds to the common fisheries policy. Already the prime minister, Geir Haarde, has suggested that his countrymen concentrate on exploiting the ocean. The economic disaster will cause an ecological disaster.</p> <p>Normally it's the other way around. In his book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, Jared Diamond shows how ecological crisis is often the prelude to social catatrosphe. The obvious example is Easter Island, where society disintegrated soon after the population reached its highest historical numbers, the last trees were cut down and the construction of stone monuments peaked. The island chiefs had competed to erect ever bigger statues. These required wood and rope (made from bark) for transport, and extra food for the labourers. As the trees and soils on which the islanders depended disappeared, the population crashed and the survivors turned to cannibalism. Diamond wonders what the Easter islander who cut down the last palm tree might have thought. \"Like modern loggers, did he shout 'Jobs, not trees!'? Or: 'Technology will solve our problems, never fear, we'll find a substitute for wood.'? Or: 'We don't have proof that there aren't palms somewhere else on Easter ... your proposed ban on logging is premature and driven by fear-mongering'?\".</p> <p>Ecological collapse, Diamond shows, is as likely to be the result of economic success as of economic failure. The Maya of Central America, for instance, were among the most advanced and successful people of their time. But a combination of population growth, extravagant construction projects and poor land management wiped out between 90% and 99% of the population. The Mayan collapse was accelerated by \"the competition among kings and nobles that led to a chronic emphasis on war and erecting monuments rather than on solving underlying problems\". (Does any of this sound familiar?) Again, the largest monuments were erected just before the ecosystem crashed. Again, this extravagance was partly responsible for the collapse: trees were used for making plaster with which to decorate their temples. The plaster became thicker and thicker as the kings sought to outdo each other's conspicuous consumption.</p> <p>Here are some of the reasons why people fail to prevent ecological collapse. Their resources appear at first to be inexhaustible; a long-term trend of depletion is concealed by short-term fluctuations; small numbers of powerful people advance their interests by damaging those of everyone else; short-term profits trump long-term survival. The same, in all cases, can be said of the collapse of financial systems. Is this how human beings are destined to behave? If we cannot act until stocks - of either kind - start sliding towards oblivion, we're knackered.</p> <p>But one of the benefits of modernity is our ability to spot trends and predict results. If fish in a depleted ecosystem grow by 5% a year and the catch expands by 10% a year, the fishery will collapse. If the global economy keeps growing at 3% a year (or 1,700% a century), it too will hit the wall.</p> <p>Iam not going to suggest, as some scoundrel who shares a name with me did on these pages last year, that we should welcome a recession. But the financial crisis provides us with an opportunity to rethink this trajectory; an opportunity that is not available during periods of economic success. Governments restructuring their economies should read Herman Daly's book Steady-State Economics.</p> <p>As usual I haven't left enough space to discuss this, so the details will have to wait for another column. Or you can read the summary published by the Sustainable Development Commission (all references are on my website). But what Daly suggests is that nations which are already rich should replace growth - \"more of the same stuff\" - with development - \"the same amount of better stuff\". A steady-state economy has a constant stock of capital that is maintained by a rate of throughput no higher than the ecosystem can absorb. The use of resources is capped and the right to exploit them is auctioned. Poverty is addressed through the redistribution of wealth. The banks can lend only as much money as they possess.</p> <p>Alternatively, we can persist in the magical thinking whose results have just come crashing home. The financial crisis shows what happens when we try to make the facts fit our desires. Now we must learn to live in the real world.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\"><br>www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The big supermarkets and food manufacturers were told by ministers yesterday to speed up payments to their suppliers to help them survive the credit crisis. </p> <p>Hilary Benn, the environment secretary, met leaders of the main food chains to emphasise that small businesses were far more dependent on the timing of payments than larger companies.</p> <p>\"A single late payment can be the difference between survival and collapse. That will be truer now more than ever in the coming weeks and months,\" Benn said after the meeting in London. Small businesses and farmers were the lifeblood of the food industry and should be helped through \"turbulent times\".</p> <p>The government has already promised it will work to help get payments to small business suppliers more promptly. It recognises that contracts are a commercial matter for supermarkets, suppliers and producers but has become concerned that small companies will be more reliant than ever on prompt payment.</p> <p>The Federation of Small Businesses welcomed Benn's intervention. Major companies should pay \"not only on time but well before time\", given the service they received from suppliers and producers, said a spokesman. </p> <p>\"It would be criminal if supermarkets improved their cash flow on the backs of small suppliers,\" he said. </p> <p>The National Farmers' Union (NFU)said anything Benn could do to ensure prompter payments would help. \"It would also be welcome if ministers emphasised the importance of sourcing food from Britain rather than abroad,\" said Lee Woodger, head of NFU's food chain unit.</p>",
  "<p>A hidden catastrophe is unfolding off the coasts of Britain which could leave our seas filled with only algae and jellyfish, a leading conservation organisation warns today. The Marine Conservation Society says severe overfishing is the biggest environmental threat facing Britain and is having a profound effect on marine ecosystems. The warning comes in Silent Seas, a report released as the government prepares its marine bill for parliament. </p> <p>The report comes the day after the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, which advises Europe's politicians on fish stocks, warned that parts of the North Sea should be closed to mackerel fishing because stocks of the species could be on the brink of collapse. </p> <p>Simon Brockington, head of conservation at the MCS, said: \"There's a moral imperative: we simply shouldn't be living in such a way that drives species to extinction.\"</p> <p>The MCS is calling on the government to introduce an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management and to move away from quotas, which it says lead to fisherman dumping stocks overboard. It also urges temporary closures of sea areas to encourage the regeneration of fish stocks. Willie Mackenzie, fisheries campaigner for Greenpeace, said: \"Fishing is the biggest threat after climate change. It has removed many of the bigger and now second-tier fish.\"</p> <p>The report said the rate of loss of fish in British seas was accelerating, with formerly abundant species such as the common skate appearing on lists of endangered species. Only eight of the total of 47 fish stocks found around the British Isles remain in a healthy state, the report says, adding that the size and quality of the fish is falling as younger fish are taken out of the sea: \"A hundred years ago a large plaice had to be 50-60cm long and weigh 1.5-2kg to be considered big. Today plaice fillets are sold as 'large' when they weigh just 125g. Fish this size have never had a chance to breed.\"</p> <p>Almost half of all fish eaten is farm-raised, but that does not guarantee sustainability, the MCS says. \"Carnivorous fish such as salmon and farmed crustaceans, such as warm water prawn, rely on wild fish to make their feed. At the moment it can take an average 3kg of wild fish to produce 1kg of farmed salmon.\"</p> <p>Prince Charles, who is president of the MCS, said it was a \"wake-up call\" that British seas were in need of urgent help. \"There is simply nowhere in Britain's seas where marine life is effectively protected from human impacts,\" he said. \"Never has it been so important to take immediate action to protect marine life.\"</p> <p>The Sea Fish Industry Authority said the UK fishing industry was a world leader in responsible sourcing and management of stocks. Its director, Jon Harman, said: \"Along with factors such as population change and widespread pollution, we now have stresses caused by climate change. However, we are proud of how our fishing fleets have responded to increased understanding of their impact on the environment and their cooperation both in terms of voluntary action and investment in new technology.\"</p>",
  "<p>Keith Harris, the man tasked with the responsibility of finding a buyer for Newcastle United, has imposed no deadlines on potential purchasers but hopes that a deal will be well under way by late November.</p> <p>\"We don't have, and never have had, any deadlines by which time bids must be submitted but we do have a 'hopeline' for the sale of Newcastle,\" said Harris yesterday. \"Our wish is that something can be in place before November ends which would give the new owner time to appoint a manager and be in a position to make new signings when the January transfer window opens.\"</p> <p>As the chairman of Seymour Pierce, the investment bank, Harris boasts a convincing record when it comes to brokering changes of ownership at Premier League clubs but, nonetheless, selling Newcastle amid the current global economic turmoil is proving a challenge. </p> <p>\"Things are very choppy in the financial world at the moment,\" admitted Harris, who was given the job of selling the club by Mike Ashley, Newcastle's owner, after the Sports Direct owner failed to find a buyer himself.</p> <p>Joe Kinnear, Newcastle's interim manager, last week claimed that six consortiums were interested in the club and that all bids had to be in by this Friday but it appears his information was inaccurate.</p> <p>Even if an offer were accepted in principle this week it would, realistically, be mid-November at the earliest before a sale could be regarded as close to completion. Once Ashley agrees a price, Seymour Pierce must confirm the prospective purchaser possesses the necessary funds and that its money is \"clean\". Meanwhile the would-be new owner is almost certain to want to perform due diligence on the club's finances, a process which could take up to a month.</p> <p>Should Christmas arrive with Newcastle still on Ashley's hands, the current owner may be faced with a choice of investing in the transfer market or contemplating a potential relegation fight. Ashley has previously insisted that he will not spend any more money on players if the club is not offloaded by January but could be forced to alter that stance.</p> <p>Kinnear is well aware that Newcastle's squad remains thin and has scoured lists of free agents. So far none has appealed and it seems unlikely that there will be any new arrivals at St James' Park during the remainder of 2008.</p>",
  "<p>Leading shares bounced back from last week's 20% slump, thanks to the government's \u00a337bn bank bail-out and signs, finally, of a concerted global effort to tackle the financial crisis.</p> <p>With Wall Street up more than 500 points by the time London closed, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> regained much of Friday's hefty falls and ended 324.8 points higher at 4256.9. The 8.26% rise is the second-best performance in percentage terms on record, after the 8.84% jump on September 19 this year, the day that City regulators banned short-selling in UK financial shares.</p> <p>Sentiment was also helped by news yesterday that Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ had sealed a deal to buy 21% of the US investment bank Morgan Stanley, albeit on slightly different terms than planned. And a dip in three-month Libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other - suggested central banks' actions to pump money into the system might be starting to have an effect. UK banking shares fell into two categories. Those taking the government money headed south, because existing investors would see their stakes diluted and would have to miss out on dividends for the foreseeable future. The other banks, which in effect plan to go it alone, moved sharply higher. So <strong>HBOS</strong> fell 34.2p to 90p; <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong> lost 27.4p to 162p, and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> dropped 6p to 65.7p.

Miners followed metal prices higher, with <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> closing 74p better at 408.5p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rising 373p to \u00a327.97.</p> <p><strong>Tui Travel</strong>, the First Choice holiday company, leapt 40.25p to 232.25p after the parent group Tui sold its container shipping business for \u20ac4.45bn (\u00a33.5bn) including debt. Tui indicated one use of the proceeds could be to buy the 49% of Tui Travel it does not own. <strong>Premier Foods</strong>, the Mr Kipling and Branston pickle business, added 3.75p to 61p after it confirmed reports it was in talks with a number of parties about cutting its \u00a31.8bn debt. The aero-engine maker <strong>Rolls-Royce</strong> rose 12.25p to 282.25p after a buy note from RBS analysts.</p> <p>The housebuilder <strong>Taylor Wimpey, </strong>which is in the middle of renegotiating banking covenants, dropped 3p to 17.75p as hedge fund Toscafund cut its stake from 10% to below the disclosable 3%.</p> <p>The Aim-listed <strong>Immunodiagnostic Systems</strong>, which produces diagnostic test kits, jumped 31p to 230p after it said first-half sales were up 84.5% compared with the same period last year.</p> <p>If Philip Green is considering buying some debt in Baugur - thus controlling some of the Icelandic group's high-street names - does this mean Marks &amp; Spencer is off his agenda?</p>",
  "<p>China is planning to build a string of new dams in southern Tibet to boost its electricity supply, the region's chief of water resources told the Guardian.</p> <p>Hundreds of millions of people across Asia depend on rivers that originate in Tibet, and previous hydroelectric proposals have proved controversial because of their impact on the environment, local people and communities downstream.</p> <p>But officials in Lhasa argue the dams are the least damaging way of providing power and raising living standards in the region. \"Tibet is rich in water resources and has good potential for setting up more hydropower stations and dams,\" said Baima Wangdui, director of the region's water resources department. \"With the economic development of Tibet we need more resources. We will take great care in protecting Tibet's natural life and consider the [impact] on society.\"</p> <p>They add that hydropower is cleaner and more efficient than coal, oil, gas or nuclear power stations to generate electricity. A 2003 study by the ministry of water suggested it could generate 1,800bn kilowatt hours a year in Tibet.</p> <p>The director said he did not know exactly how many dams would be built in the next decade because there was no detailed planning as yet. But he added that experts were considering sites.</p> <p>\"We haven't got any hydropower stations set up along big rivers like the Brahmaputra, but in the future we will consider setting them up on these sites,\" he said. \"The upper reaches of the rivers it is forbidden to develop; the middle reaches [in places like Lhasa and Xigatze] are more populated and can have limited development under certain conditions and can keep the balance with environmental protection; the lower reaches of those rivers in the deep valleys and some remote areas are the main part we are developing.\"</p> <p>Zhuang Hongxiang, an official at Tibet's environment bureau, added: \"We are trying to solve the electricity shortage and do the least damage to our environment.\" She argued that environmental impact assessments at the planning stage and careful supervision would ensure that the projects did not cause damage, particularly given that exploitation of Tibet's rich water resources was low to date.</p> <p>But Tashi Tsering, a researcher on Tibetan water resources at the University of British Columbia, warned that assessments did not recognise the full impact of damming. While they consider local biodiversity, they frequently failed to consider water quality and roles played by free-flowing rivers such as nutrient recycling.</p> <p>\"The rivers and mountains where these dams will be built and new reservoirs will inundate are often considered sacred. </p> <p>\"Resettlement and compensation cannot solve the issue,\" added Tsering, at the Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability. He said the government shelved a hydropower project at a sacred lake in east Tibet two years ago after opposition. \"It's not that the Chinese government's policies are immovable, but it requires strategic planning and campaigning from local people, journalists and environmental groups,\" he said.</p> <p>Aviva Imhof, campaign director at the International Rivers Federation, said: \"The headwaters of most of the major rivers of Asia are in Tibet, so damming them could have implications downstream.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Women's Institute (WI) has released a video sex guide that provides advice on how to perk up your sex life. What a fabulous idea, and what perfect timing. Here we are, fuel and transport bills soaring, on the brink of recession, the cost of gym membership prohibitive, pensions shrinking: sex is the only free, warming and fun pastime available to many of us. And such good exercise. Apparently doing it fairly energetically uses up the number of calories in a slice of chocolate cake. Have sex, eat cakes and stay slim. That employs the baking skills as well. </p> <p>I suppose the more prune-faced traditionalist WI members are not all that pleased, but watching the video is not mandatory. No one will be strapped down with their eyelids pinned open. And anyway, sex is only one of six topics on it. It also features gardening, IT, home management ... yawn. I can't even be bothered to write down the others. It's the sex most people are gripped by, and the new saucy face of the WI, with its cheeky calendars, burlesque dancing, touring brothels and interest in willies: watching them as puppets, drawing them in life classes, and now learning to love them and get them going.</p> <p>I personally won't be watching the video. If I want to warm up I prefer to just sit on the sofa under a pile of dogs. But I wouldn't want to hold anyone else back. If you feel the need to enhance your sex life, then the WI video could be vital. It advises on the use of sex aids and the most suitable sexual positions for arthritis, or post-heart attack. How anti-ageist and helpful. Often, one is nervous of asking about such things, in case it seems that you are a ravening beast who cannot give your poor sick husband/wife a moment's respite. </p> <p>Yes there are still - despite the world being saturated with sex - grown-ups who know little about it and need guidance. At antenatal classes we were told tragic stories of people who hadn't quite got the hang of things. One husband avoided sex while his wife was pregnant because he thought the baby might bite. If only the new WI video had been around to calm him. Broaden your horizons, it seems to be saying. Do it all over the house, in the kitchen, or in the garden, provided, of course, that nobody's looking. Why not, if that's what you fancy? Why not over the car bonnet on the open road, in the larder covered in condiments, and - if you're retired - at any time of the day or night? Happiness at last, even for those of us on a mini-pension. A hard time is sometimes good to find, so thank you, WI.</p> <p><strong>Rosemary and I were trying to get to grips with the</strong> world financial meltdown last week, but found that we understood barely a word of it - even the basics, like \"bank runs\" or the \"buyout market\", never mind \"sovereign credit default swaps\". Then Rosemary listened to Any Questions and heard that everything financial was \"illusory\", which made things a little clearer. Or at least explained why nothing was clear: because nothing is really there. Where are all the wads of banknotes or gold bars now? Do they even exist? Where are all the hundreds of billions of pounds that are going to bail out the banks? Who decides what has lost value? Why is something worth \u00a3100 today and tuppence tomorrow? How do you sell a debt? Who wants to buy one and what do you do with it? </p> <p>Everything's gone a bit too virtual. I prefer it when things are concrete. When I go shopping, I like a bag of coins, or notes, that I can hold in my hand. Then I can give them to the shop person, and carry my purchase home. </p> <p>I don't like to ring some anonymous creature and give them my bank details so that my money starts floating about somewhere and I can't really be sure where it's going to land, or whether some trickster is going to grab it on its way through space (which they did a few months ago, and spent my money on virtual bingo). I can manage a cheque for larger purchases, but even that's a bit nebulous for me. </p> <p>But I'm out of luck, because the whole world is going virtual. This text will float away to another screen, or to nowhere if I press the wrong button. I talk to virtual voices on the phone, I transfer money through the air. The Daughter and her friends live on Facebook and float their lives in cyberspace; and real people live through Second Life, \"a 3-D virtual world created by its Residents\" where \"you can create anything you can imagine ... using geometric primitives and a simple, intuitive interface\". What? Mavis's friend's husband is glued to Second Life. It's done his marriage no favours. What was wrong with his real life? Did he think he could fix it by sitting like a glomp in front of his computer forever having a pretend one? Second Life even has its own marketplace, with its own virtual currency, \"which can be converted to US dollars\". But even those don't seem to be real any more either. And Iceland is melting. </p> <p>Each night I stare at the TV news, trying my best to work things out and hear that \"the authorities may or may not know what is going on\". They're not the only ones.</p> <p><strong>This week Michele read</strong> Death Dyed Blonde, by Stanley Reynolds: \"A subtly complex mystery, funny, with terrific dialogue and minutely observed, charmingly oddball New England characters.\" <strong>She also saw Ivanov</strong>, by Chekhov: \"Brilliant acting, loads of emotion, depression, misunderstanding and screaming.

  "<p>The injection of \u00a337bn of taxpayers' money into the capital base of three British banks is the gravest event in the modern financial history of the UK. Without it, the financial system would have disintegrated and the economy imploded into depression. This brute reality is tribute not just to the powerful global forces destabilising western banking systems but also to breathtaking business misjudgment, epic regulatory failure and a 20-year indulgence of now-defunct \"free market\" principles.</p> <p>The scale of the response was required by the scale of the debacle. The banks had accumulated trillions of pounds of assets essentially built on \"securitisation\" - bundling up streams of income, insuring them, and selling them as securities to investors - whose value had been imperilled not only by the crisis in property markets but by recession generally. The buyers and insurers of these instruments have fled the markets. The banks are left with depreciating assets that have to be funded as they mature, and have no way of creating new ones. Paralysis has settled on the entire financial system.</p> <p>As a result the banks needed \u00a337bn of capital just to support the level of advances they had made, absorb write-offs and begin to make new loans. They also need the \u00a3250bn loan guarantees and \u00a3200bn of liquidity from the Bank of England. It is incredible that they could have arrived at this position while distributing huge dividends to their shareholders and vast bonuses to staff in their investment and security trading arms. They were running unsustainable businesses. Small wonder that one source close to the talks over the weekend told me the men running the most unsustainable bank, RBS, were \" broken\".</p> <p>Which is why there can only be a qualified sigh of relief at what has happened. It is good that they have much more solid balance sheets; good that Germany and the US seem set to follow. The market response in Europe and the US yesterday was heartening. But this is only the end of the beginning.</p> <p>The banks' business model has to be reconceived. It is all very well the government demanding and the banks accepting as part of the deal that they will return to the lending levels of 2007. But how? Lending in 2007 reached a climax as savings from Asia and the oil-producing states were recycled to Britain via New York. We sold the Asians those \"securitised\" income streams, insured via credit derivatives, with management teams incentivised by what everyone now agrees were recklessly high bonuses. The proceeds buoyed up the property market with familiar results. All is history.</p> <p>Chief secretary to the Treasury Yvette Cooper says the government is not in the business of running banks. But it is. The banks raise savings and lend alike in conditions determined by government. It will now have to decide on how to re-open and regulate the securitisation and credit-default swaps markets as part of the larger reform of the international financial system that Gordon Brown promises. It will also have to stimulate demand for the offers of loans it wants the banks to make. And it could, if it chose, deploy its ownership of the banks to insist they build a new business model on supporting innovation and long-term investment. This will require able men and women - the best. And they will expect good rewards.</p> <p>It is a critical time. Depression may have been avoided, but how the financial system is managed now will determine how severe the recession is and the future character of British capitalism. The government is now necessarily in the banking business, and must confront its new responsibilities.</p> <p>\u2022 Will Hutton is executive vice-chair of the Work Foundation <a href=\"mailto:will.hutton@observer.co.uk\">will.hutton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>John Duffey shakes his head as he recalls bruising racial encounters with his fellow Americans. From morning to night since May he has been working the phones on behalf of Barack Obama.</p> <p>\"People say, 'I like the guy. I like what he stands for. I like his plans, vision, but I am still undecided.' That has to be the race issue,\" says Duffey. </p> <p>Others say outright they will not vote for a black man.</p> <p>Duffey, an official with the Construction Workers' Union, works alongside his wife, daughter and two nephews at a phone bank in the headquarters of the United Steelworkers of America, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. An African-American, he said: \"It is actually a hurtful feeling that in 2008 people can't get over the race issue.\"</p> <p>In another room Kaitlin Decero, a 22-year-old intern from Indiana, is also on the phone on behalf of Obama. The team she works with averages about 300 calls an hour and race comes up a lot. </p> <p>People who have voted Democrat in the past tell her they will not be doing so this time. \"Some people will say openly, 'he is a black', 'I do not trust him', 'he is an Arab', 'he is a Muslim', 'he was not born in America'. They use the 'n-word'. We just hang up.\" Decero puts the ratio of bad calls to good at about 1 in 20.</p> <p>The impact of race is the big unknown in this election. The lingering fear among Democrats is that 2008 will be a repeat of 1982 - and subsequent races involving black candidates - when Tom Bradley lost the California governor's contest in spite of polls suggesting he had a lead of between 9% and 22%. White voters had lied in huge numbers to pollsters about their real feelings.</p> <p>Pollsters now believe the so-called \"Bradley effect\" has largely disappeared, partly because polling techniques are better at detecting racism and partly because of a cultural change in America, with those under the ago of 50 less concerned about race than their parents.</p> <p>Scott Keeter, of the Washington-based Pew Research Centre for the People and the Press, which conducts regular surveys on cultural attitudes, said: \"I would not say that the [Bradley] effect is gone completely, but I think it will be substantially smaller than in the past, if it appears at all. [But] I think it's prudent to acknowledge that we are at least partially in uncharted waters ... this is our first general election with an African-American nominee.\"</p> <p>There was serious concern among the Obama campaign a month ago that, with polls showing him in a dead heat with his Republican opponent John McCain, lack of enthusiasm on the part of blue-collar white voters in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Michigan might cost him the election. That concern has since diminished because of the economic crisis that is pushing undecideds behind Obama.</p> <p>Mike Harms, an Amalgamated Transit Union official and one of the organisers of the phone banks in Pittsburgh, said: \"I do believe people are beginning to see that the only colour that matters in this election is green [the dollar]. When it comes to pocketbook issues, people will put race behind them.\"</p> <p>Canvassers in Pittsburgh's working-class neighbourhoods - which have been among the most resistant to Obama - confirm that while there are still a lot of undecideds, support for him is on the rise. But, as in other states with big concentrations of blue-collar white workers, this is more a vote against the Republicans than a vote for Obama.</p> <p>As those campaigners who have been targeting union members elsewhere in the US have found, supporters leafleting outside the Anchor Hocking Glass Company in Beaver Falls, outside Pittsburgh, at 6am, encountered a sullen response, not entirely due to the early hour.</p> <p>Their leaflet directly confronted concerns about Obama, saying the election was about economic issues, health and union rights and \"not about fear ... anti-American, black, celebrity, elitist, Muslim, terrorist\". Many of the glass workers refused to take a leaflet. Some screwed up their faces when they saw the canvassers' Obama T-shirts. </p> <p>Leading the canvassers was Jason Altmire, a Democratic congressman for the district who is up for re-election on November 4. </p> <p>He described the first hour outside the gate as \"the worst response we have seen in a long time\". Having Obama on the ticket did not help him in the district, he said, adding he was concerned about the impact of canvassing alongside people in Obama T-shirts.</p> <p>Wayne Boyer, a 54-year-old African-American salesman and an Obama supporter, said racism was evident in the way that white Americans clung to their wallets when they saw him walking down the street. The fear among them, he said, was that, as president, Obama \"is going to push black values\".</p> <p>Obama's inner circle plays down race, apart from when it was forced to deal with the Reverend Jeremiah Wright row earlier this year. Talking about race, they believe, will cost Obama votes. They also hope the number of people who will vote against him because he is black will be outweighed by young and African-American voters. </p> <p>But Claire McCaskill, the Missouri senator who has been with Obama from the start, admitted last week: \"You can't be involved in this election without feeling unease about race in this country.\"</p> <p>Racism in northern cities and rural areas can be as virulent as in the south. Tom Tuttle, 60, a white security guard and Vietnam veteran who is undecided, told canvassers in Brookline, a working-class area in Pittsburgh, that racism was common in the city. \"It is an underlying racism. At least down south you knew they hated them. Here people have to do it behind their backs ... I think seriously someone will kill the man.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is not clear whether sparring with paparazzi, haranguing referees or expressing outrage at a pay packet of \u00a355,000 a week will be rewarded.

But CyberSports chief executive Malcolm Clark said he was banking on Football Superstars being a much more realistic experience, with players socialising and training in the in-game world as well as playing matches.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Financial stability</strong></p> <p>The Treasury says the bank bail-out plan is driven by three priorities: \"To support stability in the financial system; to protect ordinary savers, depositors, businesses and borrowers; and to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer.\" Shareholders do not figure on the list.</p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> stockmarkets bounced in London, Europe and beyond in response to the Treasury's move and similar measures from other governments. The FTSE 100 index closed up more than 8%. Meanwhile, the credit derivatives market, the best barometer of bank solvency concerns, also showed investors were increasingly confident that the prospect of bank failures was receding. </p> <p>At an operational level, however, bold moves by the Treasury to kickstart the interbank lending market did not have the hoped-for immediate impact on one of the biggest stress points within the banking system. The interbank cost of borrowing, Libor, reached almost unprecedented highs last week and remains disturbingly above central bank base rates throughout the western world. This means banks are still tending to hoard cash and liquid assets, unwilling to lend them to rivals.</p> <p>More optimistic analysts believe the latest initiatives from governments round the world will show through in Libor rates soon. \"It's enough to get these money markets up and running again,\" said David Keeble, head of rates strategy at French investment bank Calyon. \"But it might take a few weeks to filter through.\"</p> <p><strong>Banks' financial strength</strong></p> <p>The Treasury is to inject up to \u00a337bn into new shares in RBS and a merged HBOS and Lloyds TSB. It insists that after these measures - and independent capital-raising moves by banks - these institutions will each have capital cushions capable of absorbing the heaviest losses imaginable. These solvency buffers will be \"well above international minimum standards and at a level that should put them on a strong footing for the future\". </p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> IMF data shows British and European banks have about half the capital cushions of their US counterparts, so measures bolstering these positions will be widely welcomed. </p> <p>Nic Clarke, an analyst at brokerage Charles Stanley, said: \"The regulators have made it clear to UK banks that, whatever the cost to shareholders, they have to have a warchest of capital to see them through a serious downturn. In recent years banks have been running 'capital lite' models to maximise return on capital.\"</p> <p><strong>Dividends</strong></p> <p>Mindful of public unease at the level of profits made by banks in recent years, the Treasury claims to have won commitments on the distribution of future profits to shareholders. Its hand is strengthened by holding preference shares, which will absorb the bulk of surplus profits in the form of interest payments ahead of ordinary shareholders.</p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> among the few shares that did not rally on the London Stock Exchange yesterday were the three banks pursuing government-backed cash-calls. Lloyds TSB, RBS and HBOS closed down 14.5%, 8.3% and 27.5% respectively. These bank shares have in recent years been popular with many income-focused investors, including most pension funds, because of their dividend policies. Many of these investors will be ditching these shares now the government is attempting to curb payouts. More than two million private shareholders in HBOS will be hit. Richard Hunter of stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown said: \"Dividend payouts are going to be depressed. You could well see bank stocks being pretty dour for the foreseeable future.\"</p> <p><strong>Treatment of borrowers</strong></p> <p>The government imposed conditions on mortgage activities and lending to small businesses as part of the deal. For three years, the Treasury is insisting, banks in which the taxpayer is invested must keep the mortgage market open and competitively priced \"at 2007 levels\". The banks must also provide \"support for schemes to help people struggling with mortgage payments to stay in their homes\".</p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> these are warm words that many small businesses and homeowners will cling to. But it remains to be seen how they will be interpreted by the arm's-length body charged with overseeing the government's bank stakes on \"a commercial basis\". Lloyds has already revealed as part of its pact with government it will publish in its annual report details of small business loans, overdrafts and foreclosures. Others are likely to follow suit.</p> <p><strong>Curbing executive pay</strong></p> <p>Another condition wrung out of banks seeking taxpayer cash is a commitment to keep executive pay in check. The government expects no bonuses to be paid to boardroom directors in 2008. It also claims to have extracted promises that future bonus schemes will be linked to \"long-term value creation\" and will take account of risk. The kind of pay packages that allow highly incentivised executives to still keep hold of so-called \"payments for failure\" will be consigned to history, the Treasury said.</p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> the FSA has written to 30 banks warning them it will require them to hold more capital if it sees pay policies deemed to be encouraging excessive risk-taking. This is a strong shot over the bows, but the regulator does not have many powers to enforce its preferred pay schemes. Now the government is to hold shares in the banks, its mind may be more focused on ensuring key jobs are given to the best people money can hire. Gary Hoffman, poached from Barclays to lead nationalised mortgage bank Northern Rock, will be paid \u00a32m over two years, making him Britain's best-paid civil servant.</p> <h2>What are the dangers?</h2> <p><strong>1 Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> If its share price stays well below the 65p the government will pay for its 60% stake, it could signal investors believe the plan will fail. Ditto Lloyds TSB and HBOS.</p> <p><strong>2 Barclays</strong> The bank is going it alone. Failure to raise capital in the markets would send it back to be offered worse terms.</p> <p><strong>3 Libor</strong> The interbank lending rate is a barometer of confidence; any increase is bad. It fell yesterday. </p> <p><strong>4 Wall Street</strong> A repeat of wobbles last week over Morgan Stanley could start a new round of global sell-offs.</p> <p><strong>5 Recession</strong> Falling growth, employment and house prices indicate this will be the biggest hurdle.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday October 15 2008.

  "<p>The Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov last night said that he had no intention of selling his stake in Arsenal despite the global economic crisis, and compared his love for the club under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to that of a \"man for a woman\".</p> <p>Usmanov said it was \"inconceivable\" that he would sell his 24% holding in Arsenal. He declared he wanted to increase his stake to 25% - an \"objective\" that he said he announced last year. </p> <p>\"When a man loves a woman he can't conceivably sell that love. I'm in love with Arsenal. I have no intention of selling it [my stake],\" he told the Guardian yesterday. </p> <p>He added: \"That may be possible at some point in time when I know that Arsenal hates me. I will make sure this doesn't happen. I have not lost one single share.\" </p> <p>He added: \"As long as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is manager that's not going to happen.\"</p> <p>Usmanov's forthright comments came after a survey suggested that he and other Russian billionaires - including the Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich - had collectively lost $230bn (\u00a3130bn) over the past five months. According to the financial news service Bloomberg, Abramovich - Russia's third richest man and the owner of Chelsea FC - has seen his fortune plummet by $20.3bn (\u00a311.75bn). Usmanov has lost $11.7bn (\u00a36.7bn), the survey claims.</p> <p>It estimates that Russia's richest 25 individuals have suffered unprecedented losses since May, with the country's stock market falling 62% since then. The global financial crisis has largely caused the decline but it has been exacerbated by Russia's August invasion of Georgia, which saw foreign investors flee.</p> <p>Last night Usmanov insisted it was \"absolutely inconceivable I could have lost that kind of money\". He said that he had used some of the equity from his iron ore and metal firm Metalloinvest to prop up other parts of his business empire. But he said he had lost \"zero shares\" in other investments, which include a 1.5% stake in the state gas giant Gazprom and 4.9% in the metals firm Norilsk Nickel.</p> <p>In May Forbes Russia magazine estimated Abramovich's wealth at $24.3bn. Usmanov, Russia's 19th richest man, had $9.5bn, it suggested. Yesterday, however, Abramovich's spokesman John Mann also disputed Bloomberg's figures and said the Chelsea owner's losses from the economic crash had been far more modest.</p> <p>\"These are merely paper losses,\" he said. \"These figures [in the Bloomberg survey] are arbitrary. They are just as arbitrary as the ones in the Forbes list.\" </p> <p>The losses were not significant since Abramovich did not intend to sell either of his two major assets - his investments in the steel and mining company Evraz and Highland Gold, Russia's fourth largest gold producer, Mann said. Evraz's value has fallen by 88% since May. Highland Gold has lost 80% since March. It is so far not clear what impact, if any, the crash will have on the day-to-day running or future possible ownership of Chelsea and Arsenal. Last week Chelsea's chairman, Bruce Buck, conceded that the downturn would negatively affect the club, admitting Chelsea would have to \"deal with it\".</p> <p>\"The credit crunch will definitely have an impact on Chelsea Football Club, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. But we have to keep it in mind,\" Buck said. He added: \"It is quite likely that less shirts will be sold, [and] people may think twice about renewing their season tickets.\" </p> <p>Analysts agree that Abramovich is probably better placed to ride out the financial storm than several of his fellow oligarchs, who have leveraged their companies by taking out vast loans against the sinking value of their shares. Abramovich sold his company, the oil giant Sibneft, in 2004. </p> <p>Over the past week Russia's richest man Oleg Deripaska has been forced to sell his holding in the German construction company Hochtief as well as a $1.4bn stake in a Canadian auto parts company, Magna. Other cash-strapped oligarchs have also sold off assets.</p>",
  "<p>The government must allow companies to build offshore wind farms much closer to shore, as part of a series of measures to revitalise a sector that has almost stalled due to insufficient support, competitive pressures and rising costs, an authoritative report warns today.</p> <p>\"Without urgent action there is a risk that little additional offshore wind power will be built by 2020 beyond the eight gigawatts already planned or in operation,\" says the report from the Carbon Trust, an organisation established by the government to help build a greener future.</p> <p>It estimates that operators could save up to \u00a316bn if they were allowed to site turbines in shallower waters, and argues that it would be possible to take a further \u00a314bn off the estimated \u00a375bn investment needed if more funding were given to research and development.</p> <p>The trust argues that the government's incentives mechanism, the Renewables Obligation, needs to be made more attractive, and hopes that establishing a Department of Energy and Climate Change will herald a new beginning for wind power. </p> <p>Without such measures, Britain will fail to meet the climate change targets it has pledged to the European Union at a time when companies such as Shell are pulling out of offshore schemes in pursuit of cheaper onshore wind opportunities in the US, it says.</p> <p>Tom Delay, the trust's chief executive, said: \"We need something similar to the [1990s'] 'Dash for Gas' if offshore wind is to play the role expected of it. Industry costs have become very, very expensive, and both government and companies need to work hard to tackle this.\" </p> <p>He stressed that wind farms nearer to shore need not be in sight of beaches, just closer than areas such as the Dogger Bank, which is 60 nautical miles away. Inshore areas have calmer weather and permit smaller, lighter structures, making them cheaper to build and operate.</p> <p>The government said last night that the trust report highlighted interesting savings but was cautious about the demands for shallower waters to be opened up. Mike O'Brien, energy and climate change minister, said: \"The issues of fairness and cost-effectiveness, along with impacts on the environment and on other users of the sea, will be considered carefully in the lead-up to our renewable-energy strategy to be published next spring.\"</p> <p>In its report, the trust argues that the UK will need at least 29GW of offshore wind power by 2020 to hit the EU's renewable goals but only less than a third is in the pipeline, partly because steel and other construction materials have tripled in price since 2005.</p> <p>\"Currently the risk/return balance for offshore wind is not sufficiently attractive, and regulatory barriers would delay delivery well beyond 2020,\" says the report, put together with input from industry and government. </p> <p>Delay said the 29GW target by 2020 was a \"significant challenge\" but realisable. Technology costs needed to fall but \u00a3600m of public money plus \u00a31.2bn of private funding could bring breakthroughs that could cut the overall bill by \u00a314bn. </p> <p>The government introduced policies this summer that will kickstart the wider renewable sector, the trust accepts, but it says the incentive scheme needed to be expanded and extended: \"The required adjustments to the Renewable Obligation will in any case bring it closer to a feed-in tariff [an above-market return for feeding green electricity to the grid]. The government should choose the option that minimises disruption for industry.\"</p> <p>The trust also believes the government must reform regulations to make planning easier, and update National Grid transmission lines. These measures could create 70,000 jobs in Britain and \u00a38bn of annual revenues here and abroad, it says.</p> <p>Nick Rau, renewables campaigner at Friends of the Earth, expressed caution at siting turbines too near the shoreline, and said each project needed to be assessed on its merits. \"But we accept there are huge costs involved in offshore wind, and they are escalating. We need some kind of government intervention if we are to overcome these hurdles; all the evidence is that a feed-in tariff would help.\"</p> <p>John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said: \"We need to promote a massive redirection of investment away from the speculation that caused the bursting financial and housing bubbles and into green industries and job-creating programmes that will help us tackle climate change. Offshore wind could be a huge business opportunity for Britain.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/houseprices\">House prices</a> are continuing to tumble, with the number of sales for each estate agent falling to a record low of less than one a week, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says today. </p> <p>The latest Rics monthly snapshot of the market shows that a balance of 84% of surveyors saw falling rather than rising prices in September. The new number is worse than August's balance - when 82% more surveyors saw prices falling than rising - and reverses small improvements in the number in recent months.</p> <p>Rics' spokesman, Jeremy Leaf, said: \"The recent turmoil in the financial markets has dented confidence further but yesterday's announcement by the government that the recapitalisation of banks will be accompanied by increased lending to homeowners raises the possibility that the lack of mortgage finance that has so damaged the housing market might be eased.\" </p> <p>But Howard Archer, an economist at Global Insight, said: \"House prices seem poised to fall substantially further as the fundamentals remain largely negative even though tracker mortgage rates have fallen following the Bank of England's 50-basis point interest rate cut. </p> <p>\"Even if the bold government measures to tackle the financial crisis work, it will undoubtedly take time for confidence to improve and mortgage lending to pick up significantly. Meanwhile, demand for mortgages is likely to remain muted for some considerable time.\" </p> <p>The average number of transactions per surveyor over the past three months was 11.5, the lowest figure since the survey began in 1978. London is the worst-hit region, with only eight sales on average over the past three months. </p> <p>London also suffered a sharp fall in the prices balance, as did Wales, the north, the north-west and the east Midlands. By contrast the south-west, west Midlands and East Anglia saw a slight improvement, while other areas saw little change.</p> <p>\"As it stands, only those with significant finances are in a position to access the market,\" Leaf said. \"The housing market continues to hold its breath and unless mortgage liquidity improves, the market is likely to remain a dormant beast for some time to come.\"</p> <p>Recent Bank of England figures showed that mortgage lending fell by 95% in August from July, with net mortgage lending down to \u00a3143m from \u00a33bn in July and the lowest level since records began in April 1993. The number of mortgages approved for house purchases tumbled 70% in the year to August to 32,000. </p> <p>Nationwide, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, announced it was raising its tracker rates for new borrowers yesterday, despite last week's interest rate cut. \"The changes we are making will allow us to maintain control of the volume of business the society is attracting, and continue lending in a prudent and responsible way,\" said Matthew Carter, divisional director for mortgages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338567621\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/10/14/HOUSING_MARKET_1410.jpg\" alt=\"Graphic - housing market\" width=\"461\" height=\"505\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown yesterday conjured up the spirit of Roosevelt and Churchill as he called for a meeting of world leaders within a fortnight to agree a new financial architecture to replace the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, which has formed the basis of post-war international cooperation. </p> <p>Brown discussed his plan for a meeting of world leaders with President Bush on Sunday night, after returning from addressing the eurozone summit in Paris. The meeting might occur at the level of the G8 industrialised nations, but could involve a wider body. The proposal will be discussed at a two-day meeting of EU heads of government in Brussels, which begins tomorrow. </p> <p>Brown is treading carefully, since the US has long been wary of international regulation and is only now belatedly reforming its own domestic regulation system. </p> <p>Brown and his chancellor, Alistair Darling, also disclosed they were going to demand tighter supervision by boards of banks. They will also develop a counter-cyclical regulatory system of the kind expounded by Charles Goodhart, professor of banking at the LSE, intended to prevent extreme boom and bust conditions.</p> <p>In a speech to the City explaining why Britain had invested \u00a337bn in three banks, Brown said yesterday: \"In extraordinary times, with financial markets ceasing to work, the government cannot just leave people on their own to be buffeted about.</p> <p>\"We must, in an uncertain and unstable world, be the rock of stability on which the British people can depend. To let the chips fall where they may would be the height of irresponsibility.\"</p> <p>He insisted that even European-wide solutions were inadequate: \"Sometimes it takes a crisis for people to agree that what is obvious and should have been done years ago can no longer be postponed. We must create a new financial architecture for the global age.</p> <p>\"During the second world war, far-sighted leaders like Roosevelt and Churchill were already thinking about the framework that would be needed for the future - whilst in the heat of battle taking steps to forge the reconstruction and peace that was to come.\" </p> <p>Brown has been calling for a restructuring of the international regulation of capitalism for a decade, but believes he will get a fresh hearing as his standing has risen internationally in the past fortnight. Leading EU countries yesterday followed the British example in state-sponsored recapitalisation of banks, and the US treasury also disclosed it was amending bail-out plans along the lines of the Brown plan. </p> <p>Brown was yesterday widely praised for his recent leadership, with the new Nobel prize winning economist, Paul Krugman, identifying him as the man who may have saved the international financial system. </p> <p>But George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, asserted: \"This is no moment of triumph for the government.\" He said Britons \"want to know how their money is going to be protected, how quickly they can get it back, and how they ended up footing the bill for this painful end to the age of irresponsibility\".</p>",
  "<h2>New UN academy set up to fight corruption</h2> <p>Interpol and the UN crime agency set up a special academy yesterday to teach up to 1,000 officials a year how to fight corruption, a \u00a3570bn a year drain on the global economy. Authorities said the International Anti-Corruption Academy would open next autumn in Laxenburg, Vienna. As a result of the recent economic crisis \"resources will become more scarce\" and foreign aid would dwindle, said Interpol secretary-general Ronald Noble, who came up with the idea. He said many courses will last only a week to three weeks, with senior officials taught to pass on their training. <br><strong>Associated Press in Vienna</strong></p> <h2>Bruni-Sarkozy visits sick ex-Red Brigade member</h2> <p>Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has become personally involved in the case of a former Red Brigades member, visiting the woman in hospital, France's president said yesterday.

Petrella has been in France since the 1990s, and was jailed last year. But a French court ordered in August that she be freed after she was diagnosed with severe depression. Nicolas Sarkozy has told Italy he will not extradite her. <br><strong>Associated Press in Paris</strong></p>",
  "<p>Phyllis Dimond, who has died aged 96, belonged to the remarkable group of women artists who worked during the second world war for Recording Britain, an ambitious project set up to record aspects of British life and heritage under threat from bombing or invasion. Altogether 97 artists produced more than 1,500 watercolours and drawings, which, after the war, were collected in a four-volume book, Recording Britain (1946-49).</p> <p>This project was partly funded by the Pilgrim Trust, which had been established in 1930 with a bequest from the US anglophile Edward Harkness. In 1942, with the encouragement of the historian Kenneth Clark (later Lord Clark), the National Gallery mounted an exhibition to publicise the project. Dimond was among the visitors and was inspired to apply to Arnold Palmer, the coordinator, to take part. She began work that September and contributed 12 pictures in total. Her close scrutiny of the lodges and shelters of London's royal parks and Bloomsbury squares exemplified one of the project's ambitions, to celebrate minor and previously overlooked corners of London. Other subjects included the Bluecoat school, Caxton Street, SW1, and interiors of the Geffrye Museum in the East End. </p> <p>The scheme was intended to employ those unlikely to be appointed official war artists - either through age or unfitness for military service. Some were amateurs who have slipped into obscurity. Colin Wheeler, reviewing Recording Britain: A Pictorial Domesday of Prewar Britain, a 1990 revival exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, wrote that \"many of the lesser known artists have exactly the right combination of sureness of drawing and design and feeling for place which is essential for pictures that also function as a record\". </p> <p>Unfortunately local authorities to which the drawings were entrusted in 1949 did not always look after them well: some faded, or were lost, in their care. The surviving work may be seen, by appointment, in the prints and drawings room of the V&amp;A. </p> <p>Dimond was born one of three daughters and a son in St Marylebone, London. Her father came from a family of Somerset butchers, and had served in the Army Service Corps during the Boer war, and later in the Royal Naval Air Service in the first world war. His civilian jobs included caretaking and chauffeuring. </p> <p>The course of her life changed when, aged 10, she contracted Sydenham's chorea (the disease once known as St Vitus' dance). She was discouraged from working at \"academic\" subjects or applying to grammar school, but she had always liked drawing and so, at 14, she enrolled at the Hammersmith School of Art.</p> <p>The family lived in Chelsea, west London, from where Phyllis would walk to the V&amp;A to look at prints and drawings. She was particularly attracted to old buildings, and when the family moved to Hammersmith, and then to Chiswick, she counted it as \"out of London\", missing the urban landscape. </p> <p>She was accepted in 1931 by the Royal College of Art, where her tutors included Edward Bawden and Eric Ravilious. She was then a part-time student at Bolt Court, near St Paul's Cathedral, a more practically focused environment where workers could learn photo-engraving and lithography. Concurrently, she worked in animation and freelance design. </p> <p>By the time war broke out, her parents were working for the Dewar whisky family in Belgrave Square, and she painted a picture in the basement of their recently evacuated house. She explained how carefully she depicted every grain of the panelled wooden store cupboard, inspired by the house's echoing abandonment. It proved \"a very good place not to be disturbed\".</p> <p>In 1947 Dimond's depiction of The Goat Tavern, Stafford Street, off Bond Street, was included in Alan Bott's book, The Londoner's England: Contemporary Water-Colours and Drawings of London and the Home Counties. In 1958 the Royal Academy first showed her work, and in the mid-1960s examples were entered for the Lord Mayor's awards. In 1966 she took part in a Westminster artists' exhibition, and she continued to show still-life watercolours at St John's Wood church Christian Aid exhibitions until the end of the 1990s. </p> <p>Her reputation grew mainly through word of mouth, and commissions increased - one Mrs Ahern saw a painting in Miss James's antique shop in St Christopher's Place and, through her enthusiasm, a group of 16 watercolours and drawings were presented to the St Marylebone library. They included Dimond's London Tradesmen series from 1933, Welbeck Street, view of the rooftops of the Russian Chapel (1959) the Western General Dispensary, Cosway Street (1959) Bloomsbury County Court (1960) and views of St Christopher's Place (1966). </p> <p>In 1971 Dimond completed an ambitious study of the Samaritan hospital on Marylebone Road. She avoids the use of white paint, and each of the hundreds of individual panes of glass is a tiny piece of the original paper peeping through. Her practised observation was aided by a sense of humour and lightness of touch: a drawing of Portman Square ignores the grand entrances of the terrace, focusing instead on the disused gates and a modern brick wall, with workmen's signs and a brash yellow car acting as a foil to the neo-classical motifs and empty apses. Her portrait of the handsome No 10 Wimpole Street (1962) does the terrace justice but also includes the precise number of new doorbells, and crooked rooftiles to remind viewers of the reality of ageing buildings. </p> <p>St Marylebone remained one of Phyllis's favourite areas, and she and her daughter, Frances, for many years lived within walking distance of Barrett Street, where Phyllis had been born. Frances survives her.</p> <p>\u2022 Phyllis Irene Dimond, artist, born October 20 1911; died September 25 2008</p>",

Morgan Stanley said it had $900bn of assets, down from $987bn at the end of August.</p> <p>Insiders at Morgan Stanley said the bank would have no immediate need to tap the US treasury for funds under an expected government initiative to recapitalise the banking sector.

The financier George Soros appealed to the US treasury to help, writing in the Financial Times that Morgan Stanley \"urgently needs rescue\".</p>",
  "<p>The US government summoned banking bosses to Washington yesterday to put the finishing touches to a plan to pump billions of dollars into the financial industry, sparking frenzied anticipation of a rescue that sent shares on Wall Street flying.</p> <p>Anxious to avoid lagging behind Europe in supporting troubled institutions, the US treasury said it was moving \"quickly but methodically\" towards an initiative that is likely to include guaranteeing inter-bank lending and taking equity stakes in leading banks.</p> <p>Encouraged by the prospect of bail-outs on both sides of the Atlantic, buyers returned to the US stockmarket. During the morning session in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average surged by as much as 578 points to 9,029 - the biggest intra-day rise on record - in the first sustained sign of a bounce in the blue-chip index after eight days of decline.</p> <p>After initially planning simply to clean up banks' balance sheet by buying distressed assets, the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, has accepted that far more radical aid is necessary, in spite of the Bush administration's deep aversion to government intervention in private enterprise.</p> <p>Top Wall Street names including the chief executives of Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan were invited to discuss details of rescue proposals at a mid-afternoon meeting with Paulson. A treasury spokeswoman said the get-together was to \"finalise details on a financial market stabilisation initiative\".</p> <p>The US treasury official in charge of restoring financial stability, Neel Kashkari, said in a speech that officials were working \"around the clock\" to establish a framework for action. The department has set up seven policy teams to deal with different aspects of a bail-out, including equity purchases, loan purchases, keeping homeowners in their properties and adjusting Wall Street pay packages.</p> <p>\"We are moving quickly but methodically, and I am confident we are building the foundation for a strong, decisive and effective programme,\" said Kashkari.</p> <p>He revealed that 70 firms had applied for a role as \"master custodian\" in managing the US government's banking investments. The list has been whittled down to three, with the winner to be announced within 24 hours.</p> <p>On Wall Street, the mood was cheered by confirmation of a $9bn (\u00a35.2bn) investment by Japan's Mitsubishi USJ into the troubled bank Morgan Stanley and by news of merger talks to combine forces among Detroit's struggling \"big three\" carmakers: General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.</p> <p>\"Everybody knew that we were going to have an up day eventually,\" said Dave Rovelli, managing director of US equity trading at Canaccord Adams. Prior to yesterday, the Dow Jones index was yet to finish a day in positive territory since the beginning of October.</p> <p>Many leading high-street banks in the United States remain in a sickly condition. One of the strugglers, the Philadelphia-based Sovereign Bancorp, which has 750 branches nationwide and 12,000 staff, revealed it was in talks about a possible takeover by Spain's Banco Santander, which already owns a 25% stake.</p> <p>The prospect of government investment has been welcomed by US banks as it could help to restore trust and confidence, reigniting lending between institutions. </p> <p>The treasury has stressed that any programme of equity investments will be voluntary and that \"healthy\" firms will be eligible, in an attempt to avert any stigma attached to government aid that could drive down the stocks of participating banks even further. </p> <p>At the White House, President Bush made a joint appearance with the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, to offer reassurance on efforts to combat the financial crisis.</p> <p>\"These are tough times for our economies,\" said Bush. \"Yet we can be confident that we can work our way through these challenges. And America will continue to work closely with the other [G7] nations to coordinate our response to this global financial crisis.\"</p>",
  "<p>The governments of Europe yesterday embarked on their biggest financial gamble since the launch of the euro single currency with the boldest financial rescue scheme ever seen. They are pledging to buy up tottering banks, underwrite their lending, and flood the markets with liquidity in a package that could run to a staggering \u20ac2tn in total across the EU.</p> <p>In a closely coordinated rash of announcements and observing the same rules and similar conditions, Germany, France, Austria, and Spain unveiled packages worth hundreds of billions of euros aimed at shoring up their banks and financial systems, while Italy, Sweden, Poland, and Norway prepared parallel action.</p> <p>The radical and risky moves followed an emergency summit of the 15 single currency countries in Paris on Sunday night which agreed a set of rules and instruments for the unprecedented state interventions modelled on the British government's triple-pronged strategy unveiled last week.</p> <p>The scale, ambition and potential costs of the programmes announced yesterday suggested that European leaders such as Gordon Brown, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, were determined to rise to the challenge of the financial crisis through concerted action, displaying a degree of leadership that put Washington, the global economic leader, in the shade.</p> <p>\"United Europe has pledged more than the US,\" said Sarkozy, chairing the EU, as he announced a \u20ac360bn package for France. \"European policymakers are racing ahead of the US in their efforts to solve the crisis,\" said Italy's Unicredit bank.</p> <p>Shortly after Brown explained his bailout of British banks and called for an overhaul of the global financial system, Merkel announced a \u20ac500bn rescue plan for Germany. Sarkozy followed suit. The Austrian and Spanish governments each revealed plans to make \u20ac100bn available for bank buyouts, interbank lending and bank bond issuance guarantees.</p> <p>Across the 15-country eurozone, the overall bill for the various national schemes operated according to a transnational rulebook could top a trillion euros. Factoring in Britain's estimated \u00a3500bn package as well as parallel plans in parts of Scandinavia and central Europe outside the eurozone, could take the cost for the EU's 27 states to \u20ac2tn.</p> <p>With the European taxpayer being asked to step up to the plate at a time of looming recession, and with the rescue packages signifying severe potential stress on national budgets, debt ratios, and public spending plans, it appeared that European leaders were betting their political careers on the attempt to calm and restore confidence in the financial markets.</p> <p>For the first time in weeks of panic and meltdown, there was an air of cautious optimism that Europe's response, after weeks of dithering and incohesive rhetoric, offered the best chance of stabilising a financial system careering out of control.</p> <p>\"After a haphazard start, Europe is finally getting its act together,\" said Bank of America. \"The size and nature of the national plans suggest that they could finally make a difference.\"</p> <p>Announcing a \"financial market stabilisation fund\", Merkel indicated that she was abandoning her aim of balancing Germany's budget by 2011. The German finance ministry put the scale of the German scheme at \u20ac500bn, with the bulk, as everywhere else, being earmarked to guarantee medium-term bank lending to try to jolt the banks out of their sclerosis and banish fear and suspicion. Some \u20ac70bn - with the option to top that up by \u20ac10bn - could be used to recapitalise troubled financial institutions.</p> <p>A bill implementing the plan is to be rushed through the German parliament by Friday.</p> <p>The German fund is the near-equivalent of an annual budget and comes just when the country is recovering from the mammoth costs of financing German unification over the past 15 years.</p> <p>As decided on Sunday, the loan guarantees would run until the end of next year, in Germany as well as everywhere else in the eurozone. A summit of the EU-27 tomorrow in Brussels is expected to adopt Sunday's blueprint for the entire EU. Finance ministers are to take part in the summit which will also be addressed by Jean-Claude Trichet, the head of the European central bank.</p> <p>Unlike Brown and Sarkozy who have been keen to launch the series of coordinated national rescue schemes, Merkel has been sceptical for the past week. Her rhetoric on the bailouts is markedly different from the urgency being advocated by Brown and Sarkozy.</p> <p>Austria announced a \u20ac100bn scheme, of which 85% will be used to underwrite bank lending if necessary. Spain offered an identical fund to guarantee bank bond issuance, but said there was no need yet to make money available for banks recapitalisation. Italy's central bank offered to buy bank debt to the tune of \u20ac40bn.</p> <p>The banking sectors in Spain and France are believed to be the healthiest in Europe at the moment, requiring less intervention. Nonetheless, Sarkozy proposed legislation to be pushed through parliament this week allocating \u20ac360bn, \u20ac40bn of which could be used to buy up bits of ailing banks.</p>",
  "<p>A revolutionary multibillion-pound fund should be set up to pay the owners of the world's rainforests not to cut them down, a report to the prime minister will say today. The report by special adviser John Eliasch says the scheme would be a comparatively cheap way to reduce climate change emissions and would also inject vital funds into developing countries to help alleviate poverty. </p> <p>The report says that a global carbon market could pay the tropical rainforests' owners, or people living in, them to save and maintain the trees, which store carbon dioxide - the main contributor to climate change. In addition, saving the rainforests would help to control global rainfall patterns. They are also home to more than half the world's species.</p> <p>The World Bank has estimated the cost of reducing deforestation by one fifth at $2bn-$20bn (\u00a31.15bn-\u00a311.5bn) a year, leading campaigners to calculate that halting the problem would cost up to $100bn a year. </p> <p>But the Eliasch review claims countries without forests could also benefit from a global forest emission trading system, which would be relatively cheap compared with saving emissions at home. </p> <p>\"Integrating forests within a global cap and trade system would create opportunities to tackle a large part of current CO2 emissions while at the same time delivering substantial finance to forest conservation and sustainable forest management,\" says the report. \"Forest carbon finance could also make a significant impact on reducing poverty through increased financial flows to developing countries.\"</p> <p>The report marks a significant shift in the debate about saving rainforests, which has until now been dominated by charities and rich individuals - including Eliasch and the Cool Earth group he helped to set up - raising funds to buy forests, provoking outrage from some governments and local communities. </p> <p>The new model has been supported by some environmental campaigners and by the government of Guyana, which last year offered to save its rainforests in return for payments from Britain. But others warn that it would allow developed countries to avoid tackling their own emissions. </p> <p>\"These proposals offer countries the chance to buy their way out of reducing emissions through forest protection,\" said Greenpeace's head of biodiversity, Andy Tait. </p> <p>\"If relatively cheap forest credits were easily traded with other carbon units, they could 'flood' or otherwise destabilise the markets. This is likely to bring the price of carbon crashing down, reducing incentives to invest in clean and renewable energy technologies in donor countries.\"</p> <p>The Eliasch review says new research forecasts that without action to stop deforestation the problem would, by itself, generate enough carbon dioxide emissions to tip the planet over the level considered crucial to avoid more than 2C of warming. \"Consequently ... forests will need to form a central part of any global climate change deal,\" it says.</p> <p>Deforestation contributes about 17% of global carbon emissions, the third biggest source behind power generation and industry, and bigger than either China or the United States, says the report. It forecasts the pressure on forests will increase as world population grows by more than 2.5 billion people in the next 40 years.</p> <p>\"Rainforests [are] like a giant global utility right now, like a water utility or a power station, that's providing a service we're not paying for,\" said Andrew Mitchell, director of the Global Canopy Programme. \"When you don't pay your electricity bill, you get cut off. We should recognise these countries shouldn't provide us with a service [for] free.\"</p> <p>Mitchell added: \"We're saying we need to build carbon capture and storage to take the carbon out of the atmosphere and forgetting about the plants taking it out for free. We have to do both.\"</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday October 14 2008 to include comments by Andrew Mitchell, director of the Global Canopy Programme.</p>",
  "<p>He might have <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canadavotes/story/2008/09/30/rae-harper.html?ref=rss\">plagiarised a speech</a> from the former prime minister of Australia, but Stephen Harper still has a long way to go before he becomes Canada's equivalent to John Howard. The recent news that Harper copied a speech written for Howard on the eve of the Iraq war was more than a superficial political gaffe: it was a reminder of how Howard's 11 years in power <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/11/australia.barbaramcmahon\">almost destroyed Australia's reputation</a> as a progressive nation \u2013 and that Harper could do the same if his Conservative party is elected to a majority tomorrow.</p> <p>Thankfully, it doesn't look like this will be happening any time soon. Widely expected to win a majority when he <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canadavotes/story/2008/09/07/parties-campaigns.html?ref=rss\">announced the election five weeks ago</a>, the most recent national polls are now showing that Harper will return to parliament with only another minority government. Polls published today in the Globe &amp; Mail newspaper show that <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081013.welectionpolls13/BNStory/Front\">Harper's party is down three points from its popular vote in 2006</a>, and that, unlike the election two years ago, this time voters who favour the NDP and Green party are more likely to stick to these preferences than they were in 2006.</p> <p>The leader of the rival Liberal party <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/FederalElection/article/516369\">recently branded Harper a \"quitter\"</a>, but the Liberals themselves are faring little better. Most polls are placing their support at around 26% or 27%, and far fewer NDP and Green party supporters have shifted to the Liberals in the closing days of the election than were expected. With no sudden surge in support for the Bloc Quebecois, the NDP or the Liberals, it almost seems as though Canadians are voting for the party they dislike the least, giving no party a real mandate to lead.</p> <p>So what happened to Harper's assured majority? At first glance, the economy is the obvious answer. The Economist magazine argued last week that, while Canada has been protected from the worst of the economic crisis so far, fears in the country have been overblown by <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=12380857\">Canada's exposure to America's alarmist media</a>, which Stephan Dion, the Liberal leader, has harnessed to create a kind of meta-economic crisis in the absence of a real one.</p> <p>The Economist is unduly dismissive of Canadian concerns. <a href=\"http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/business/story.html?id=87587bd1-bbeb-4840-b74f-b1eff72b54a3\">Economic worries are certainly very real to many Canadians</a>, particularly outside of Alberta. Rising food prices and declining access to credit have hit hard, as they have elsewhere, in addition to problems caused by the strong Canadian dollar last year, which damaged trade with the US, the country that buys the vast majority of Canadian exports. The idea that Canadians have concerns about their economy because of their overexposure to American media, and not because of their country's dependency on trade with the US, is a dubious thesis at best.</p> <p>But although Canadians' economic concerns are real, they don't fully account for Harper's declining support before the election. With the Greens the only party very visibly making gains, the most recent polls suggest a nation that doesn't want to give Harper any more power but hasn't yet forgiven <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/29/international/americas/29canada.html\">the corruption of the Liberals</a> in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Perhaps some Canadian citizens even enjoy having a minority government, a less extreme form of co-habitation like in France, where the downside of gridlock is countered by the advantage that no one party can effect too much damaging change because they can effect little change at all.</p> <p>This belies Harper's own record as minority prime minister, where, despite his precarious position in parliament, he <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070622/harper_kyoto_070622/20070622?hub=Politics\">managed to renege on the Kyoto agreement and commit Canadian troops to Afghanistan</a> for an additional two years, to 2011. With another minority government, he could doubtless continue his incremental infringement on civil liberties and environmental issues, but he won't have sufficient clout to be a full-blown John Howard, at least.</p> <p>There is, of course, a temptation to see tomorrow's vote as a test case for the November 4 election in the US, a temptation which runs the risk of dismissing Canada as a practice-America, but which can't be avoided altogether either. Even many Canadian news outlets are devoting as much time to the Obama-McCain race and the economic crisis as they are to covering their own election, and it will be the first western post-economic crisis election of 2008, unless you count Austria, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/30/austria\">recent votes for right-wing extremists</a> are simply too alarming to contemplate, and too country-specific to extrapolate any general post-economic crisis voting patterns.</p> <p>If Harper doesn't win a majority, is this an indicator that Americans will vote against conservatives and an unregulated economy on November 4 as well? Perhaps, but it ignores the domestic dynamics of the main Canadian parties and the specifics of Harper's and Dion's campaign mistakes. If he only attains a minority government tomorrow, the economic crisis will likely be Harper's justification for his low levels of support, but the cracks were there long before the talk of global economic downturn. Either way, after tomorrow, the rest of Canada will at least have one less thing to furtively worry over as they read their morning newspapers: two elections and a global crisis are just too much to keep up with at once.</p>",
  "<p>We meet at a moment of great uncertainty for America. The economic crisis we face is the worst since the Great Depression. Markets across the globe have become increasingly unstable, and millions of Americans will open up their 401(k) statements this week and see that so much of their hard-earned savings have disappeared. </p> <p>The credit crisis has left businesses large and small unable to get loans, which means they can't buy new equipment, or hire new workers, or even make payroll for the workers they have. You've got auto plants right here in Ohio that have been around for decades closing their doors and laying off workers who've never known another job in their entire life. </p> <p>760,000 workers have lost their jobs this year. Unemployment here in Ohio is up 85% over the last eight years, which is the highest it's been in sixteen years. You've lost one of every four manufacturing jobs, the typical Ohio family has seen their income fall $2,500, and it's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage, or fill up your gas tank, or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month. At this rate, the question isn't just \"are you better off than you were four years ago?\", it's \"are you better off than you were four weeks ago?\" </p> <p>I know these are difficult times. I know folks are worried. But I also know this \u2013 we can steer ourselves out of this crisis. Because we are the United States of America. We are the country that has faced down war and depression, great challenges and great threats. And at each and every moment, we have risen to meet these challenges \u2013 not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans. </p> <p> We still have the most talented, most productive workers of any country on Earth. We're still home to innovation and technology, colleges and universities that are the envy of the world. Some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities. It won't be easy, but there's no reason we can't make this century another American century. </p> <p>But it will take a new direction. It will take new leadership in Washington. It will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years. And that's why I'm running for president of the United States of America. </p> <p>My opponent has made his choice. Last week, Senator McCain's campaign announced that they were going to \"turn the page\" on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead. His campaign actually said, and I quote, \"if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose\". Well Senator McCain may be worried about losing an election, but I'm worried about Americans who are losing their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings. They can't afford four more years of the economic theory that says we should give more and more to millionaires and billionaires and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. We've seen where that's led us and we're not going back. It's time to turn the page.</p> <p> Over the course of this campaign, I've laid out a set of policies that will grow our middle-class and strengthen our economy in the long-term. I'll reform our tax code so that 95% of workers and their families get a tax cut, and eliminate income taxes for seniors making under $50,000. I'll bring down the cost of health care for families and businesses by investing in preventative care, new technology, and giving every American the chance to get the same kind of health insurance that members of Congress give themselves. We'll ensure every child can compete in the global economy by recruiting an army of new teachers and making college affordable for anyone who wants to go. We'll create five million new, high-wage jobs by investing in the renewable sources of energy that will eliminate the oil we currently import from the Middle East in ten years, and we'll create two million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads, schools and bridges. </p> <p>But that's a long-term strategy for growth. Right now, we face an immediate economic emergency that requires urgent action. We can't wait to help workers and families and communities who are struggling right now \u2013 who don't know if their job or their retirement will be there tomorrow, who don't know if next week's paycheck will cover this month's bills. We need to pass an economic rescue plan for the middle-class and we need to do it now. Today I'm proposing a number of steps that we should take immediately to stabilise our financial system, provide relief to families and communities, and help struggling homeowners. It's a plan that begins with one word that's on everyone's mind, and it's spelled J-O-B-S. </p> <p>We've already lost three-quarters of a million jobs this year, and some experts say that unemployment may rise to 8% by the end of next year. We can't wait until then to start creating new jobs. That's why I'm proposing to give our businesses a new American jobs tax credit for each new employee they hire here in the United States over the next two years. </p> <p>To fuel the real engine of job creation in this country, I've also proposed eliminating all capital gains taxes on investments in small businesses and start-up companies, and I've proposed an additional tax incentive through next year to encourage new small business investment. It is time to protect the jobs we have and to create the jobs of tomorrow by unlocking the drive, and ingenuity, and innovation of the American people. And we should fast track the loan guarantees we passed for our auto industry and provide more as needed so that they can build the energy-efficient cars America needs to end our dependence on foreign oil. </p> <p>We will also save one million jobs by creating a jobs and growth fund that will provide money to states and local communities so that they can move forward with projects to rebuild and repair our roads, our bridges and our schools. A lot of these projects and these jobs are at risk right now because of budget shortfalls, but this fund will make sure they continue. </p> <p>The second part of my rescue plan is to provide immediate relief to families who are watching their paycheck shrink and their jobs and life savings disappear. I've already proposed a middle-class tax cut for 95% of workers and their families, but today I'm calling on Congress to pass a plan so that the IRS will mail out the first round of those tax cuts as soon as possible. We should also extend and expand unemployment benefits to those Americans who have lost their jobs and are having a harder time finding new ones in this weak economy. And we should stop making them pay taxes on those unemployment insurance benefits as well. </p> <p>At a time when the ups and downs of the stock market have rarely been so unpredictable and dramatic, we also need to give families and retirees more flexibility and security when it comes to their retirement savings. </p> <p>I welcome Senator McCain's proposal to waive the rules that currently force our seniors to withdraw from their 401(k)s even when the market is bad. I think that's a good idea, but I think we need to do even more. Since so many Americans will be struggling to pay the bills over the next year, I propose that we allow every family to withdraw up to 15% from their IRA or 401(k) \u2013 up to a maximum of $10,000 \u2013 without any fine or penalty throughout 2009. This will help families get through this crisis without being forced to make painful choices like selling their homes or not sending their kids to college.</p> <p>The third part of my rescue plan is to provide relief for homeowners who are watching their home values decline while their property taxes go up. Earlier this year I pushed for legislation that would help homeowners stay in their homes by working to modify their mortgages. When Secretary Paulson proposed his original financial rescue plan it included nothing for homeowners. When Senator McCain was silent on the issue, I insisted that it include protections for homeowners. Now the Treasury must use the authority its been granted and move aggressively to help people avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes. We don't need a new law or a new $300bn giveaway to banks like Senator McCain has proposed, we just need to act quickly and decisively.</p> <p>I've already proposed a mortgage tax credit for struggling homeowners worth 10% of the interest you pay on your mortgage and we should move quickly to pass it. We should also change the unfair bankruptcy laws that allow judges to write down your mortgage if you own six or seven homes, but not if you have only one. And for all those cities and small towns that are facing a choice between cutting services like healthcare and education or raising property taxes, we will provide the funding to prevent those tax hikes from happening. We cannot allow homeowners and small towns to suffer because of the mess made by Wall Street and Washington. </p> <p>For those Americans in danger of losing their homes, today I'm also proposing a three-month moratorium on foreclosures. If you are a bank or lender that is getting money from the rescue plan that passed Congress, and your customers are making a good-faith effort to make their mortgage payments and renegotiate their mortgages, you will not be able to foreclose on their home for three months. We need to give people the breathing room they need to get back on their feet. </p> <p>Finally, this crisis has taught us that we cannot have a sound economy with a dysfunctional financial system. We passed a financial rescue plan that has the promise to help stabilise the financial system, but only if we act quickly, effectively and aggressively. The Treasury Department must move quickly with their plan to put more money into struggling banks so they have enough to lend, and they should do it in a way that protects taxpayers instead of enriching CEOs. There was a report yesterday that some financial institutions participating in this rescue plan are still trying to avoid restraints on CEO pay. That's not just wrong, it's an outrage to every American whose tax dollars have been put at risk. No major investor would ever make an investment if they didn't think the corporation was being prudent and responsible, and we shouldn't expect taxpayers to think any differently. We should also be prepared to extend broader guarantees if it becomes necessary to stabilise our financial system.</p> <p> I also believe that [the] Treasury should not limit itself to purchasing mortgage-backed securities \u2013 it should help unfreeze markets for individual mortgages, student loans, car loans, and credit card loans. And I think we need to do even more to make loans available in two very important areas of our economy: small businesses and communities. </p> <p>On Friday, I proposed [a] small business rescue plan that would create an emergency lending fund to lend money directly to small businesses that need cash for their payroll or to buy inventory. It's what we did after 9/11, and it allowed us to get low-cost loans out to tens of thousands of small businesses. We'll also make it easier for private lenders to make small business loans by expanding the Small Business Administration's loan guarantee program. By temporarily eliminating fees for borrowers and lenders, we can unlock the credit that small firms need to pay their workers and keep their doors open. And today, I'm also proposing that we maintain the ability of states and local communities that are struggling to maintain basic services without raising taxes to continue to get the credit they need. </p> <p>Congress should pass this emergency rescue plan as soon as possible. If Washington can move quickly to pass a rescue plan for our financial system, there's no reason we can't move just as quickly to pass a rescue plan for our middle-class that will create jobs, provide relief, and help homeowners. And if Congress does not act in the coming months, it will be one of the first things I do as president of the United States. Because we can't wait any longer to start creating new jobs, to help struggling communities and homeowners, and to provide real and immediate relief to families who are worried not only about this month's bills, but their entire life savings. This plan will help ease those anxieties, and along with the other economic policies I've proposed, it will begin to create new jobs, grow family incomes, and put us back on the path to prosperity. </p> <p>I won't pretend this will be easy or come without cost. We'll have to set priorities as never before, and stick to them. That means pursuing investments in areas such as energy, education and health care that bear directly on our economic future, while deferring other things we can afford to do without. It means scouring the federal budget, line-by-line, ending programs that we don't need and making the ones we do work more efficiently and cost less. </p> <p>It also means promoting a new ethic of responsibility. Part of the reason this crisis occurred is that everyone was living beyond their means \u2013 from Wall Street to Washington to even some on Main Street. CEOs got greedy. Politicians spent money they didn't have. Lenders tricked people into buying home they couldn't afford and some folks knew they couldn't afford them and bought them anyway. <br>We've lived through an era of easy money, in which we were allowed and even encouraged to spend without limits, to borrow instead of save.</p> <p>Now, I know that in an age of declining wages and skyrocketing costs, for many folks this was not a choice but a necessity. People have been forced to turn to credit cards and home equity loans to keep up, just like our government has borrowed from China and other creditors to help pay its bills.</p> <p>But we now know how dangerous that can be. Once we get past the present emergency, which requires immediate new investments, we have to break that cycle of debt. Our long-term future requires that we do what's necessary to scale down our deficits, grow wages and encourage personal savings again.</p> <p>It's a serious challenge. But we can do it if we act now, and if we act as one nation. We can bring a new era of responsibility and accountability to Wall Street and to Washington. We can put in place common-sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again. We can make investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the 21st century. We can restore a sense of fairness and balance that will give ever American a fair shot at the American dream. And above all, we can restore confidence \u2013 confidence in America, confidence in our economy, and confidence in ourselves. </p> <p>This country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in nearly a century. And future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test. Will they say that this was a time when America lost its way and its purpose? When we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession? </p> <p>Or will they say that this was another one of those moments when America overcame? When we battled back from adversity by recognising that common stake that we have in each other's success? </p> <p>This is one of those moments. I realise you're cynical and fed up with politics. I understand that you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders. You have every right to be. But despite all of this, I ask of you what's been asked of the American people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history. I ask you to believe \u2013 to believe in yourselves, in each other, and in the future we can build together. </p> <p>Together, we cannot fail. Not now. Not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save. Not when there are so many Americans without jobs and without homes. Not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor, or send their child to college, or pay their bills at the end of the month. Not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves. </p> <p>We can do this. Americans have done this before. Some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe I can't go to college but my child can, maybe I can't have my own business but my child can. I may have to rent, but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own. I may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for Senate. I might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the United States of America. </p> <p>Now it falls to us. Together, we cannot fail. Together, we can overcome the broken policies and divided politics of the last eight years. Together, we can renew an economy that rewards work and rebuilds the middle class. Together, we can create millions of new jobs, and deliver on the promise of healthcare you can afford and education that helps your kids compete.

  "<p>The US government summoned banking bosses to Washington today to put the finishing touches to a plan to pump billions of dollars into the financial industry, sparking frenzied anticipation of a rescue which sent shares on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/13/wall-street-crisis-rodrik\">Wall Street </a>flying.</p> <p>Anxious to avoid lagging behind Europe in supporting troubled institutions, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US treasury</a> said it was moving \"quickly but methodically\" towards an initiative which is likely to include guaranteeing interbank lending and taking equity stakes in leading banks.</p> <p>Encouraged by the prospect of bail-outs on both sides of the Atlantic, buyers returned to the US stockmarket. The Dow Industrial Average soared 936 points closing at 9387, which was the biggest daily point gain in history.</p> <p>After initially planning simply to clean up banks' balance sheets by buying distressed assets, the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, has accepted that far more radical aid is necessary in spite of the Bush administration's deep aversion to government intervention in private enterprise.</p> <p>Top Wall Street names including the chief executives of Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan were invited to discuss details of rescue proposals at a mid-afternoon meeting with Paulson. A treasury spokeswoman said the get-together was to \"finalise details on a financial market stabilisation initiative\".</p> <p>The US treasury official in charge of restoring financial stability, Neel Kashkari, said officials were working \"around the clock\" to establish a framework for action. The department has set up seven policy teams to deal with different aspects of a bail-out including equity purchases, loan purchases, keeping homeowners in their properties and adjusting Wall Street pay packages.</p> <p>\"We are moving quickly - but methodically - and I am confident we are building the foundation for a strong, decisive and effective programme,\" said Kashkari.</p> <p>He said 70 firms had applied for a role as \"master custodian\" in managing the US government's banking investments. The list has been whittled down to three, with the winner to be announced within 24 hours.</p> <p>On Wall Street, the mood was cheered by confirmation of a $9bn investment by Japan's Mitsubishi in the troubled bank Morgan Stanley and by news of merger talks to combine forces among Detroit's struggling \"big three\" carmakers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.</p> <p>\"Everybody knew that we were going to have an up day eventually,\" said Dave Rovelli, the managing director of US equity trading at Canaccord Adams. </p> <p>Many leading high-street banks in the US remain in a sickly condition. One of the strugglers, Philadelphia-based Sovereign Bancorp, which has 750 branches and 12,000 staff, revealed it was in talks about a possible takeover by Spain's Banco Santander, which already owns a 25% stake.</p> <p>The prospect of government investment has been welcomed by US banks because it could help to restore trust and confidence, re-igniting lending between institutions. </p> <p>The treasury has stressed that any programme of equity investments would be voluntary and that \"healthy\" firms would be eligible \u2013 an attempt to avert any stigma attached to government aid which could drive down the stocks of participating banks even further. </p> <p>In Washington, the Democratic speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called for a fresh economic stimulus package to follow up on millions of tax rebate cheques sent out earlier in the year.</p> <p>\"The country is at a very challenging moment,\" said Pelosi before hosting a forum for economists. \"We need to address the fragility of our markets.\"</p> <p>At the White House, Bush made a joint appearance with the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, to offer reassurance on efforts to combat the financial crisis.</p> <p>\"These are tough times for our economies,\" said Bush. \"Yet we can be confident that we can work our way through these challenges. And America will continue to work closely with the other [G7] nations to coordinate our response to this global financial crisis.\"</p>",
  "<p>The London stockmarket posted its second highest daily rise ever today, after the <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">UK government unveiled an injection</a> of \u00a337bn into Britain's biggest high street banks and eurozone leaders announced a rescue plan overnight.</p> <p>Wall Street also rallied, with the Dow Jones jumping more than 580 points by 1pm EDT as US treasury secretary Hank Paulson prepared to meet US banking bosses amid speculation that a UK-style recapitalisation programme is imminent. With stockmarkets around the world staging rallies after days of nervous trading, the FTSE 100 led the way - closing 324.8 points or 8.26% higher at 4256.9. </p> <p>This beats the 7.89% bounceback on October 21 1987 following the Black Monday crash. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/table/2008/sep/19/ftse100.best.days\">highest ever rise, 8.84%,</a> was recorded just last month after the $700bn (\u00a3380bn) Wall Street bail-out was first announced.</p> <p>There were also sharp gains in the rest of Europe, with Germany's Dax and France's CAC both closing 11% higher. Asian markets bounced back after enduring their worst week for more than 20 years. The Wall Street rally came ahead of a summit between Paulson and the heads of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other major US banks that could see the Treasury follow the example of the UK and other European countries in investing billions of dollars of state funds in beleaguered institutions.</p> <p>Despite speculation that UK banking shares might be suspended, they traded as usual today. Shares in Barclays, which said it would seek to raise \u00a39.5bn of fresh capital from investors without government help, closed 3.7% higher at 215.25p. HSBC, which is not involved in the capital injection, gained 7.5% to 849.25p. </p> <p>But the three banks that will receive government funding fell. After an early rally Lloyds TSB shares fell 14.5% to 162p, Royal Bank of Scotland lost 8.3% to 66p, and HBOS, the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 today, slumped 27.5% to 90p.</p> <p>The UK government confirmed this morning that it will pump up to \u00a337bn into RBS, Lloyds and HBOS in an attempt to prevent the country's banking sector from melting down. </p> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/12/banking-economy\">a weekend of negotiations</a> which continued through Sunday night, the Treasury announced the unprecedented rescue plan under which bank bosses <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/banking-executivesalaries\">face a crackdown on pay and bonuses</a>, and shareholder dividends will be axed.</p> <p>This came after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/12/banking-europe\">leaders of the 15 eurozone countries unveiled a rescue plan</a> for their troubled banking systems at an emergency summit in Paris last night. The summit followed a frenetic weekend of activity in Washington, in which the IMF, the World Bank, the G7 club of rich western nations and the broader G20 group all called for urgent and coordinated action.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business+world/iceland\">Iceland stock exchange</a> remained closed today. Retail magnate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/retail-iceland\">Sir Philip Green</a> jetted to Iceland at the weekend to negotiate a deal with the stricken investment group Baugur to buy up to \u00a31bn of its debts. The billionaire was back in London today but talks continued. The move would give him huge influence over Baugur's fashion chains, such as House of Fraser, Oasis and Karen Millen. </p> <p>The Russian stock exchange was suspended again after steep falls when it resumed trading this morning. When trading was halted at 2.30pm BST, the benchmark RTS index was down 6.3% at 791.2 points. </p> <p>Russia's London-traded shares soared 16% this morning as oil prices bounced back and the country's parliament approved an $86bn (\u00a350bn) financial sector rescue plan. <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">Oil</a> climbed by more than $4 to rise above $80 a barrel this morning, after falling nearly $9 to hit the lowest level in over a year on Friday. US crude for November delivery rose $4.28 to $81.98 a barrel. In London, Brent crude gained $3.97 to $78.06 a barrel. </p> <p>The Tokyo stockmarket, which plunged nearly 10% on Friday to end its worst week in history, was closed for a public holiday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 10.2% to 16312 today after losing more than 7% on Friday. The South Korean stockmarket rose 3.8% to 1288 and Singapore's Straits Times was up 6.6% at 2076. </p> <p>In India, the Bombay stock exchange gained 7.6% to 11332 after the Indian finance minister said the government was working on more measures to improve liquidity.</p> <p>Australia's main index recovered from an 8% plunge on Friday to rise 4.7% as investors responded positively to a government pledge to guarantee bank and other lender deposits for three years.</p> <p>Only stockmarkets in Taiwan and New Zealand were down again.</p>",
  "<p>The governments of Europe today embarked on their biggest financial gamble since the launch of the euro single currency by pledging to buy tottering banks, underwrite their lending and flood the markets with liquidity in a package that could cost up to \u20ac2trillion (\u00a31.5trillion) across the EU.</p> <p>In a closely coordinated rash of announcements, Germany, France, Austria and Spain unveiled packages worth hundreds of billions of euros aimed at shoring up their banks and financial systems, while Italy, Sweden, Poland and Norway prepared parallel action. </p> <p>The radical and risky moves followed an emergency summit of the 15 single currency countries in Paris on Sunday night which agreed a set of rules and instruments for the unprecedented state interventions modelled on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2008/oct/13/europeanbanks-europe\">British government's triple-whammy strategy</a> unveiled last week.</p> <p>The scale, ambition and potential costs of the programmes suggested European leaders were determined to rise to the challenge of the financial crisis through concerted action, displaying a degree of leadership that put Washington, the global economic leader, in the shade.</p> <p>\"United Europe has pledged more than the US,\" said Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president and current chairman of the EU, as he announced a \u20ac360bn package for France.</p> <p>The day began with Gordon Brown explaining his bail-out of British banks and calling for an overhaul of the global financial system. Then the German chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/germany-banks-europe\">Angela Merkel</a>, announced a \u20ac500bn rescue plan for Germany, and Sarkozy made his announcement. The Austrian and Spanish governments revealed plans to each make \u20ac100bn available for bank buyouts, interbank lending and bank bond issuance guarantees.</p> <p>Across the 15-country eurozone, the overall bill for the various national schemes could top a trillion euros. Factoring in Britain's package, estimated to cost \u00a3500bn as well as parallel plans in the parts of Scandinavia and central Europe outside the eurozone, the cost to the 27 countries of the EU could soar to \u20ac2trillion.</p> <p>It appears that European leaders are betting their political careers on the attempt to calm and restore confidence in the financial markets. For the first time in weeks of panic and meltdown, there was an air of cautious optimism that Europe's response, after weeks of dithering and incohesive rhetoric, offered the best chance of stabilising a financial system careering out of control.</p> <p>\"European policymakers are now racing ahead of the US in their efforts to solve the crisis,\" said the Italian Unicredit bank, while the Bank of America said: \"After a haphazard start, Europe is finally getting its act together. The size and nature of the national plans suggest that they could finally make a difference.\"</p> <p>Announcing a \"financial market stabilisation fund\", Merkel indicated she was abandoning her aim of balancing Germany's budget by 2011. The German finance ministry put the scale of the German scheme at \u20ac500bn, with the bulk, as everywhere else, being earmarked to guarantee medium-term bank lending to try to jolt the banks out of their sclerosis and banish fear and suspicion. About \u20ac70bn, with the option to top that up by \u20ac10bn, could be used to recapitalise troubled financial institutions. A bill implementing the plan is to be rushed through the German parliament by Friday.</p> <p>The German fund is the near-equivalent of its annual budget and comes just when the country is recovering from the mammoth costs of financing German unification over the past 15 years.</p> <p>As decided on Sunday, the loan guarantees would run until the end of next year, in Germany as well as everywhere else in the eurozone. </p> <p>A summit of the EU-27 on Wednesday in Brussels is expected to adopt Sunday's blueprint for the entire EU. Finance ministers are to take part in the summit which will be addressed by Jean-Claude Trichet, the head of the European Central Bank.</p> <p>Unlike Brown and Sarkozy, who have been keen to launch the series of coordinated national rescue schemes, Merkel has been sceptical for the past week. Her rhetoric on the bail-outs is markedly different from the urgency being advocated by Brown and Sarkozy.</p> <p>Austria announced a \u20ac100bn scheme, 85% of it to be used to underwrite bank lending if necessary. Spain offered an identical fund to guarantee bank bond issuance but said there was no need yet to make money available for banks' recapitalisation. Italy's central bank offered to buy bank debt to the tune of \u20ac40bn.</p> <p>The banking sectors in Spain and France are believed to be the healthiest in Europe, requiring less intervention. Nonetheless, Sarkozy proposed legislation to be pushed through parliament this week allocating \u20ac360bn of which \u20ac40bn could be used to buy parts of ailing banks.</p>",
  "<p>After last week's tumultuous 20% slump, leading shares have bounced back following the government's \u00a337bn bank bail out and signs - finally - of a concerted global effort to tackle the current financial crisis.</p> <p>With Wall Street up more than 500 points by the time London closed, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> regained 324.8 points to 4256.9. The 8.26% rise is the second best performance in percentage terms on record, after the 8.84% jump on Freaky Friday, September 19 this year. That was the day the City regulator, the FSA, announced its ban on short selling UK financial shares.</p> <p>Sentiment was also helped by news that Japan's Mitsubishi had sealed a deal to buy 21% of US investment bank Morgan Stanley, albeit on slightly different terms that originally planned. And a dip in three month libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other - suggested that central banks' actions to pump money into the system might be starting to have an effect.</p> <p>UK banking shares fell, broadly, into two categories. Those taking the government money headed south, on the basis that existing shareholders would see their stakes diluted and would have to forgo their dividends for the foreseeable future. The other banks, who plan to effectively go it alone, moved sharply higher. So <strong>HBOS</strong> fell 34.2p to 90p, <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong> lost 27.4p to 162p and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> dropped 6p to 65.7p. But <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> added 200.5p to \u00a312, <strong>Barclays</strong> was 7.75p better at 215.25p and<strong> HSBC</strong> closed 59.25p higher at 849.25p.</p> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Great Portland Estates</strong> dipped 14p to 280p on talk that its chief executive Toby Courtauld could be in the frame to join British Land to replace Stephen Hester, who has agreed to take over from Fred Goodwin at RBS.</p> <p>Miners followed metal prices higher, on hopes that the economic slowdown might not be as bad as feared. Copper rose around 5%, additionally helped by news that Chile's Escondida, the world's biggest copper mine, was forced to shut down part of its operations. So <strong>Kazakhmys </strong>closed 74p higher at 408.5p and<strong> Rio Tinto</strong> rose 373p to \u00a327.97.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Tui Travel</strong> - the First Choice holiday company - jumped 40.25p to 232.25p on bid hopes after its parent group Tui AG sold its container shipping business for \u20ac4.45bn including debt. Tui AG indicated one use of the proceeds could be to buy the 49% of Tui Travel it does not already own.</p> <p><strong>Premier Foods</strong>, the Mr Kipling and Branston pickle business, added 3.75p to 61p after it confirmed reports it was in talks with a number of parties about cutting its \u00a31.8bn debt. The talks were said to be with private equity groups, and analysts at Citigroup said if Premier's shares fell much further, they would not be surprised to see a full bid rather than just an injection of capital.</p> <p>Aero-engine maker <strong>Rolls-Royce</strong> rose 12.25p to 282.25p after a buy note from Royal Bank of Scotland analysts. They said: \"Once fire-fighting of the credit crunch finishes and the market becomes more forward-looking, we believe some companies, such as Rolls-Royce, will be seen as the victors. After all, we saw Rolls-Royce weather the storm in 2002 and 2003 with some aplomb when it had a much weaker standing in the market and a weaker financial position. Then followed a rewarding period of share price performance. We think at least the same can happen again.\"</p> <p>Hotel and restaurants group <strong>Whitbread</strong>, which reports half year results tomorrow, rose 77.5p to 969.5p on talk that entrepreneur Robert Tchenguiz had sold his 3% stake in the business last week.</p> <p>But housebuilder <strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong> - which is in the middle of renegotiating its banking covenants - dropped 3p to 17.75p as hedge fund Toscafund cut its stake from 10% to below the disclosable 3% level.</p> <p>Finally Aim listed <strong>Immunodiagnostic Systems</strong>, which produces diagnostic testing kits, jumped 31p to 230p after it said first half sales were up 84.5% compared to the same period last year. House broker Oriel Securities said: \"Amidst turbulent markets, we take the opportunity to pare back our target price to 300p but with this still representing more than 50% upside on the current share price we remain buyers.\"</p>",

  "<p>Nearly 40% of people believe their cash would be best stashed under their beds rather than invested in the stockmarket, according to a poll conducted by theguardian.com. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/poll/2008/oct/10/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">The poll</a>, carried out by the business section over the past three days, showed that a large number of people have been put off buying shares amid growing fears of global recession. </p> <p>Of the 1,014 people who voted, 379 (37.4%) said they were not buying shares but hiding their money under the mattress. However, a larger proportion - 51.4% - said they were putting their money back into the market, seeing the steep price falls as a buying opportunity. </p> <p>Those who are buying are following the lead of the so-called Sage of Omaha, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/warrenbuffett\">Warren Buffett</a>. The legendary American investor put $5bn of his money in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a> in September and a further $3bn in General Electric. Both investments are down but Buffett is renowned for taking a long-term view. </p> <p>The move gave Goldman Sachs a strong vote of confidence and fuelled a surge in banking shares on Wall Street when it was announced. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2008/oct/10/warrenbuffett-richlists\">Buffett</a>, who is widely admired for his astute, common sense approach to investments, has taken his place at the top of America's rich list again after the financial crisis has rattled the wealth of many American billionaires. </p> <p>In the New York Daily News, Peter Siris, an investment manager at Guerrilla Capital, said people needed to feel confident enough to spend and invest if economies were to recover from the crisis. Hiding money under mattresses would only worsen the turmoil and freeze the economy up, he said. </p> <p>\"If we are willing to buy a car or a house, at a discounted value, the economy will stabilise,\" he wrote. \"If we do not panic, we will be able to muddle through. It will not be a boom, but it will be better than the fear the markets reflect.\" </p> <p>Many analysts are urging investors to take a long-term view when considering whether to buy or sell. </p> <p>\"Investors need to look at what's happening and determine whether we're really heading for Armageddon,\" said Justin Urquhart Stewart, analyst at Seven Investment Management. </p> <p>\"Likelihood is that things will be a bit better in five years' time and this is the long-term view that needs to be taken. Now is the worst time to sell off; investors shouldn't look at the short term.\" </p> <p>The Guardian poll showed that about 11% of those who voted were putting their money in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/commodities.marketturmoil\">gold</a>. The precious metal is traditionally seen as a safe haven asset during times of economic uncertainty. </p> <p>The stockmarket recovery today pushed gold prices down by 2% to $828.75 (\u00a3475) per ounce. Gold futures shed 4% to trade at $824.5 an ounce. However, last week it was trading as high as $911 an ounce. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/poll/2008/oct/13/banking-creditcrunch\">separate poll</a>, many people are confident the rescue package announced by the government will save the banking sector, with more than 66% of those who have voted so far saying they believe the bail-out plan will work. </p> <p>Many economists seemed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/banks-experts\">optimistic</a> following the latest Treasury action. While taking a broadly positive view, however, they stressed that investors should not expect an overnight turnaround as it will take several weeks for the plans to take effect. </p> <p>\"The Brown plan should be supported wholeheartedly as there is no plan B,\" said David Buik at BGC Partners. \"It looks like the end of the world has been postponed but that doesn't mean we won't see some wild volatility.\" </p> <p>Other analysts expressed concerns that the rescue package increased the risk for taxpayers and the country's already dire public finances.</p>",
  "<p>A material that promises to turn heat into electricity more efficiently than anything possible today has been developed by scientists. The discovery could be used to turn the waste heat from a variety of sources, such as a car's exhaust pipe or a power station, into useful power.</p> <p>The technology, known as thermoelectrics, is already used today but is restricted to niche refrigeration and cooling devices. This is because of the cost of the materials and their relatively low efficiency, usually converting only 5% of the heat input into electricity.</p> <p>In the new research, scientists found that adding antimony and lead to a well-known semiconductor, lead telluride, produced a highly efficient thermoelectric material that worked even at relatively high temperatures. </p> <p>Mercouri Kanatzidis, a professor of chemistry at Northwestern University in Illinois who led the research, said that his new material could be used to produce a new generation of devices that were up to 14% efficient. He said a longer-term efficiency goal for his work was around 20%.</p> <p>\"We cannot explain [the effect] 100%, but it gives us a new mechanism, and probably new science, to focus on as we try to raise the efficiency of thermoelectrics,\" Kanatzidis said of his research, which is published in the latest online edition of the international chemistry journal Angewandte Chemie.</p> <p>Thermoelectric materials convert heat into electricity by exploiting the difference in temperature across the different sides of a device. Electrons move from the hotter side of the material to the colder side, creating a voltage. </p> <p>The potential applications are wide. A device made from thermoelectric material could, for example, be attached to a car's exaust pipe, said Kanatzidis. The side in contact with the hot exhaust would push electrons to the colder side of the thermoelectric device, which would be exposed to the air. The electricity generated could be sent back to the engine to help drive the car or charge a battery. </p> <p>Since the majority of the energy in vehicle fuel is wasted as heat after being burned in an internal combustion engine, even clawing some of this back into useful power would be useful. The researchers say it could be possible to raise the reduce fuel consumption by up to 10% using an appropriate thermoelectric device. Other researchers are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/27/alternativeenergy.energy\">using steam to harness waste heat from engines</a>. </p> <p>Elizabeth Milsom, environment and energy policy manager at the Royal Society of Chemistry, pointed out its potential uses in large-scale applications. \"You've got combined heat and power stations and that's good if the community lives close by, but you could have a nuclear power station that is far away from communities \u2014 if you could turn that waste heat into more electricity, that will be a good thing.\"</p> <p>She added that because research into thermoelectrics was a relatively new area, there would still be many applications yet to be discovered. \"The question is whether the materials will be available for that to happen on a commercially viable scale.\"</p>",

  "<p>Toy shop Hamleys and department store House of Fraser stressed their independence today, despite being partially owned by stricken Icelandic investment group Baugur, which is being stalked by British retail tycoon Sir Philip Green.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/retail-iceland\">Green jetted to Iceland at the weekend</a> to negotiate a deal with Baugur to buy up to \u00a31bn of its debts. The billionaire was back in London today but talks continued. The move would give him influence over Baugur's investments, which include fashion chains Oasis, Karen Millen, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/debenhams\">Debenhams</a> and Moss Bros. </p> <p>Hamleys, which is 65%-owned by Baugur, said it \"would like to clarify that it is a standalone, independent British company. Hamleys has Icelandic shareholders but is a separate legal entity and is not a subsidiary of Baugur.\"</p> <p>It added: \"Any change in the ownership structure of shareholders has no direct impact on Hamleys' ability to trade effectively. Hamleys has no current or future funding requirement from its shareholders. Furthermore, Hamleys has no banking, funding or other ties with any Icelandic banks; Hamleys banking is solely with a major UK bank.\"</p> <p>Hamleys also said that it has not had its assets frozen, despite media speculation, and continues to perform strongly, with positive year-on-year growth.</p> <p>The global financial crisis has thrown <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business+world/iceland\">Iceland into turmoil</a>. Iceland has brought much its banking sector under state control in recent days, and the country's stock exchange remained closed today.</p> <p>House of Fraser, which is 35%-owned by Baugur, also distanced itself from the economic crisis in Iceland. Its chairman, Don McCarthy, said: \"There is no doubt that Baugur is facing a difficult period, as they have been unwillingly drawn into the Icelandic banking crisis and the unfortunate political repercussions between the Icelandic and UK governments. </p> <p>\"While we remain positive that the situation will be resolved, it is important to understand our distance from these events. House of Fraser is very confident of its broad and supportive shareholder structure and also of its debt position.\"</p> <p>He added that House of Fraser's funding is \"supplied through a group of international banks, led by HBOS and with whom we have a strong relationship and we have repaid and/or cancelled over \u00a3110m of the debt as a result of the financial strength of the company and its ability to generate strong cash flows\".</p> <p>That means that House of Fraser is not part of the dialogue between Green and Baugur.</p>",

  "<p>The Wall Street bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/morganstanley\">Morgan Stanley</a> gave itself vital breathing space today by closing a deal to secure $9bn (\u00a35.18bn) of funding from Japan's Mitsubishi after sweetening the terms to reflect a recent collapse in its share price.</p> <p>After a frantic weekend of negotiations, Morgan Stanley secured the investment in return for preference shares equivalent to a 21% stake but which will give Mitsubishi a relatively high return through a 10% annual dividend.</p> <p>Within moments of the opening bell on Wall Street, shares in Morgan Stanley rocketed by 56% to $15.14. The stock lost more than half its value last week on rumours that the Mitsubishi deal was on the rocks \u2013 and on speculation, hotly denied by Morgan Stanley, that the US bank's financial position was weakening.</p> <p>In a memo to staff, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, John Mack, acknowledged the scale of the scare which has gripped the 73-year-old Wall Street institution.</p> <p>\"These are truly unprecedented times, and I know the last few weeks have been difficult for all of you,\" said Mack. \"Tough times like this test people, and the people of Morgan Stanley have risen to the challenge.\"</p> <p>Terms of the deal were amended to give Mitsubishi more preference shares and to take out a tranche of common stock, given the diminution in the value of ordinary shares. Mitsubishi will get a seat on Morgan Stanley's board.</p> <p>The US bank said the money would bring its ratio of capital to assets to 15.5%, well above the 6% required by the Federal Reserve. Morgan Stanley said it has $900bn of assets, down from $987bn at the end of August.</p> <p>The US government has been closely following Morgan Stanley's progress. The treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, has made it clear that he will not allow another major Wall Street firm to follow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a> into bankruptcy.</p> <p>There was no explicit guarantee from the US authorities attached to Mitsubishi's investment. Morgan Stanley insiders say the firm is now well capitalised and is unlikely to seek an equity investment from the US treasury under an imminent program by the government to buy stakes in tottering banks.</p> <p>With $1.1 trillion in bank deposits, Mitsubishi provides critical cash credibility to back Morgan Stanley. The Japanese bank's president, Nobuo Kuroyanagi, said: \"Despite a very challenging environment, MUFG [Mistubishi] and Morgan Stanley have demonstrated our mutual commitment to this strategic alliance and have revised the terms of our investment in the best interests of both companies and our shareholders.\"</p> <p>Morgan Stanley employs 48,000 people at 600 offices in 35 countries. Battered by recent events, it recently joined Goldman Sachs in converting from a standalone investment bank to a commercial banking group, accepting regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission in return for a licence to accept deposits from the public.</p> <p>The credit rating agency Moody's added fuel to nerves about Morgan Stanley's position last week by putting the bank on watch for a potential downgrade in its credit worthiness.</p> <p>Insiders at Morgan Stanley have blamed short sellers for taking advantage of panic on the stockmarket to drive down the bank's stock for quick profits.</p>",

  "<p>The government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">emergency \u00a337bn recapitalisation of the UK banking sector</a> will mean widespread, fundamental changes at Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and Lloyds TSB. Barclays, Santander and Nationwide are also acting now to increase their capital bases.</p> <h2>RBS</h2> <p>The sheer speed of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup\">RBS's decline</a> is as dramatic as the parlous state it now finds itself in. Just a year after leading the \u20ac71bn (\u00a356bn) acquisition of ABN Amro, the bank will be majority-owned by the UK government in return for up to \u00a320bn of fresh capital. Chief executive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/18/royalbankofscotlandgroup.banking2\">Sir Fred Goodwin</a> is carrying the can, leaving shortly and being replaced by Stephen Hester. The chairman, Sir Tom McKillop, will retire next April.</p> <p>RBS will raise \u00a35bn from the government by issuing preference shares (which are higher priority than standard shares and provide a protected dividend). These will yield 12% a year. It is also issuing \u00a315bn of new ordinary shares at 65.5p each, which will be underwritten by the government. If the government takes up the full allocation, as expected, it will own around 60% of RBS.</p> <p>RBS also admitted that it expects to suffer impairment charges and further asset write-downs in the fourth quarter of this year. Shareholders will not receive a dividend until the government's preference shares have been repaid.</p> <p>It has also yielded to the government's call for an end to excessive pay. The board will not receive a bonus this year, and any bonuses earned in 2009 will be paid in shares. </p> <p>Board members who are dismissed will receive a severance package which is \"reasonable and perceived as fair\", it added, suggesting that existing contractual obligations will no longer carry much weight.</p> <p>Shares in RBS have slumped by 85% in the last year. Having changed hands for 450p a year ago, they fell to below 60p this morning.</p> <h2>Lloyds TSB</h2> <p>The \u00a35.5bn capital injection into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lloydstsbgroup\">Lloyds TSB</a> is tied into its takeover of HBOS. The government had agreed buy \u00a31bn of preference shares, and Lloyds will also raise \u00a34.5bn through a rights issue at 173.3p a share which is underwritten by the government.</p> <p>Lloyds has also forced HBOS to accept a lower price. It will now pay 0.605 Lloyds shares for each HBOS share, down from 0.833 shares each. This values HBOS at around \u00a36.9bn, although the value of the all-share offer will continue to change in the current volatile markets. Unless other investors step in, the goverment will be left owning 43.5% of the enlarged bank. Existing Lloyds shareholders will own 36.5%.</p> <p>It pledged to continue using HBOS's site on The Mound as its Scottish Headquarters, to keep holding its AGM in Scotland and to continue to print Bank of Scotland notes.</p> <p>Directors have been asked to take this year's bonus in shares rather than cash. Lloyds also warned that any board member that loses the confidence of the board will be dismissed \"at a cost that is reasonable and perceived as fair\".</p> <p>Shares in Lloyds TSB have fallen around 63% in the last 12 months, down from 550p a year ago to just over 200p today. </p> <h2>HBOS</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/hbos\">HBOS</a> had little choice but to accept a lower offer from Lloyds TSB, having seen its shares plunge as much as 40% on a single day last week.</p> <p>It will receive \u00a311.5bn from the government - \u00a33bn in preference shares that will yield 12% a year, and \u00a38.5bn through a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/rightsissues\">rights issue</a> at 113.6p a share. The government's preference shares will be converted into Lloyds TSB shares once the merger goes through.</p> <p>Britain's biggest mortgage lender also admitted that market conditions have deteriorated significantly in recent weeks. It blamed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/housingmarket\">falling house prices</a> and the problems in the credit market, warning that underlying results for 2008 will be significantly lower than previously thought.</p> <p>The chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/29/hbosbusiness.banking2\">Andy Hornby</a>, and chairman, Dennis Stevenson, will both quit when the Lloyds takeover goes through, ending speculation over their futures. Both had been blamed for HBOS's demise. </p> <p>Shares in HBOS have nosedived by 90% in the last year, from 880p each to just 85p today.</p> <h2>Barclays</h2> <p>The Treasury had been expected to take a stake in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay\">Barclays</a>. However, the bank said today it hopes to raise \u00a39.5bn in fresh capital from investors without government help.</p> <p>Under a plan that has been approved by the FSA, Barclays wants to raise more than \u00a36.5bn through a series of new share issues, underwritten by the government, and at least a further \u00a33.5bn through scrapping its dividend and other measures.</p> <p>The bank said that an \"existing shareholder\" had agreed in principle to take up \u00a31bn of shares, but if the rest of the issue is not taken up then the burden is likely to fall on the taxpayer.</p> <p>In a blow to shareholders, Barclays is axing its annual dividend for this year, which would have been payable in April 2009, saving \u00a32bn. It intends to resume dividend payments in the second half of next year. The bank will save another \u00a31.5bn through \"balance sheet management\" and \"operational efficiencies\".</p> <p>If Barclays fails to raise capital from investors, it can call on the government for funding. The terms would be negotiated at the time and could be \"less favourable\" than those made available to other banks today, Barclays said.</p> <p>Barclays also reported that it had traded \"satisfactorily\" in July and August. In September, profit before tax \"very significantly\" exceeded the monthly run rate for the first half of the year, thanks to strong contributions from global retail, commercial banking and investment banking, and strong inflows of new customers and customer deposits. </p> <p>Shares in Barclays, which peaked at 769.36p in February 2007, have dropped more than 60% over the past 12 months. At the start of the year, they were worth 490.83p; this morning, they traded at 232p.</p> <h2>Alliance &amp; Leicester/Abbey</h2> <p>Although it is not part of the UK government's rescue bid, Spanish bank Santander has agreed to invest \u00a31bn in its UK operations. It owns Abbey and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/allianceleicester\">Alliance &amp; Leicester</a>, which were previously estimated to have a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/glossary.tier.one\">Tier 1 ratio - a measure of capital strength</a> - of 8% at the end of the year. The injection will improve the ratios by 1.25 percentage points. Santander also recently agreed to buy Bradford &amp; Bingley's branches and deposits.</p> <h2>HSBC</h2> <p>HSBC said it would not be seeking government help as it had strengthened its capital base last week with an equity injection of \u00a3750m. The injection, funded through the group's own resources, represented 1% of the total shareholder equity of the HSBC group. </p> <p>\"This fulfilled the bank's agreed commitment under the UK government scheme,\" said a spokesman. \"We have no plans to utilise the capital being made available by the UK government.\" However, HSBC welcomed the government's efforts to \"support the UK banking sector and restore confidence\". It added that it is doing its bit to stabilise the financial markets by providing \"significant amounts of liquidity\" to the London sterling interbank market \u00ad\u2014 lending around \u00a34bn of three-month and six-month money to other banks \u2014 and said it hoped others would follow suit.</p> <h2>Standard Chartered</h2> <p>Standard Chartered bank also announced that it had met the capital requirements set out in last week's scheme and said it would continue to do so. Like HSBC, it welcomed today's deal but declined to opt into the government's recapitalisation scheme. \"The group is well capitalised and highly liquid,\" it said in a statement. \"We will continue to manage our capital proactively, raising capital when and where necessary, consistent with regulatory requirements and the growth and needs of the business.</p> <h2>Nationwide</h2> <p>Nationwide is also not turning to the government for help. Britain's biggest building society insisted today that is has no need for additional funds, but has agreed to support the government's plan by raising \u00a3500m in fresh capital.</p> <p>\"This is a prudent step which reflects unprecedented market conditions,\" said Nationwide, adding that it would raise this additional capital \"through normal market channels between now and our financial year end.\"</p>",
  "<p>Today at 5.30pm, environmental activists, in Edwardian costume, will throng Parliament Square \u2013 and we are all invited to join them, dressed as we are. Taking inspiration from the suffragettes' \"parliament rush\" of 1908, the <a href=\"http://www.climaterush.co.uk/\">Climate Rush</a>, a legal demonstration in which some MPs will participate, seeks to press the urgency of climate change, at a time when it seems to take second place in government policy to short-term economic calculations.</p> <p>For while Gordon Brown in 2007 staked Britain's claim to <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/19/europe/EU-POL-Britain-Climate-Change.php\">world leadership</a> on climate change, describing it as \"the great project of this generation\", his government's actions are less impressive. While the climate change bill moves slowly through parliament, we have last Thursday's decision for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/stansted.airport.expansion.capacity\">extension</a> of Stansted airport after lobbying from BAA, approval for new runways at Heathrow and City airports, and hinted plans to build a new generation of coal-fired electricity plants. At the same time, the British government has made no response to either the offer by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/opinion/24sat4.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">Guyana</a> (where I was born) of trusteeship over 40m acres of virgin rain forest in exchange for modest development assistance or Ecuador's request for help so it can afford not to allow oil extraction in its corner of the Amazon.</p> <p>The irony of the proposed new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorth\">coal-fired power station</a> in Kent is that it lies in a region which will be invaded by the ocean if sea levels rise as high as feared. Few serious scientists have any doubt that burning coal and oil over three centuries drove rises in carbon dioxide levels, and with it climate change, and that we are at the brink of catastrophic change. At the poles, in the Maldives, on the coasts of England itself, the evidence is before our eyes. And the British public is aware of this: Defra's 2007 survey showed public opinion viewed the environment as among the five most urgent matters \u2013 above taxes, immigration, and pensions.</p> <p>But public opinion has long come last in state decisions \u2013 and this why the Climate Rush has chosen to wear the red suffragette sash. One hundred years on, we may all have the vote, but almost all are still among the politically excluded. The climate activists are mainly people in their 20s who marched against an attack on Iraq in 2002 and 2003, and were ignored by the majority in parliament. They have seen, most recently at the Climate Camp in August, how the \"anti-terrorism\" and \"serious crime\" legislation passed in haste in 2000 and 2005 have been used against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/kingsnorthclimatecamp.climatechange\">peaceful protest</a>, and to distance parliament from the people. We should all share their impatience that this government, elected only by scarcely more than one-fifth of the eligible population, answer to the public on climate change.</p> <p>The tragedy of the Labour governments of 1997-2008 is that they kept the old Fabian arrogance about governing on behalf of the people, while having lost the confidence of the Webbs and Shaws, and the heroic generation of 1945, that public interest should prevail over private. For whether it is stopping the prosecution of corruption \"on the grounds of national security\" on behalf of the arms industry, linking aid to Africa to the privatisation of utilities to the benefit of water companies, or overruling planners to allow airport expansion on behalf of the aviation lobby, New Labour rarely finds a principle which it won't bend on behalf of a British corporation. In part this is because of their supine posture towards the tarnished marketist idols of the 1980s. But it is also our fault: while corporations press their interests, most citizens accept elections every few years as a substitute for democracy. Our passivity in front of parliament has made this possible.</p> <p>The Climate Rush is at once an explicit call for Britain to meet its promise to lead the global fight against climate change, and an implicit demand for the renewal of British democracy, for a parliament closer to the people. It might even be seen as in invitation for the Labour party to return to its Edwardian roots.

See you in Westminster.</p>",
  "<p>For me and for many a library has been, to use the phrase of surely one of the greatest Conservative thinkers, TS Eliot, a \"still point in the turning world.\" And now <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/oct/12/1\">Andy Burnham wants to invade them with all the twittering of the world outside</a>, in spite of the protestations of what are now termed \"traditionalists\".</p> <p>I'm sorry, but if valuing the deep thought that is done best in silence, and undisturbed absorption in a subject is traditionalist, and if proper learning and study is traditional - whether it be of bee-keeping, cooking or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B\">linear B</a> - then I am unapologetically a traditionalist. Moreover, I am a traditionalist in order to safeguard the progression of our future.<br> The culture secretary's suggestion is far more damaging than merely destroying the few sanctuaries of quiet left in this twittering world (though that is bad enough), it is in essence undermining the necessity of deep and complex thought that requires peace and quiet. It places day-to-day \"chatter\" above what current experts and generations of great thinkers down the ages have to offer us. It is an affront to expertise, to history and the value of history. It is being offered a lift on to the shoulders of giants, and saying: \"No thanks, I'm staying down here, and mine's a medium latte.\" Don't get me wrong, I love a medium latte. I also enjoy chattering away to my friends for hours on end. Interacting with other people in our immediate environment is one sort of learning; it teaches you about the here and now. Direct access through reading to what generations before us took their entire lifetimes to learn on a subject is another, and equally valuable. As Ziggy Marley warns Tomorrow People: \"If you don't know your past, you don't know your future.\" Concentrated reading (whether on screen or paper) is different from watching a TV documentary. Both have their merits, and we should value them both. But we must be aware of their differences. Text can be pondered and torn apart, while television concentrates on the experience rather than the analysis and has probably already raced onto the commercial break as you internally argue the last point. The tragedy of all this is that the \"chatter\" that Burnham wants to bring into our libraries is already available in coffee shops and in many bookshops. There has been a proliferation of places which encourage web browsing and reading in a chatty environment; there is no need for libraries to replicate this. By all means, let libraries have a cafe attached where books can be taken off the shelves and read. But there is no reason for Burnham to deny people the space for quiet thought. This is social discrimination. The well-off will still be able to access silence \u2013 for example in a room of their spacious detached house, or their country escape. My local libraries in Bristol are often peopled with GCSE students who can't find a quiet place at home to work. These are often students living in the smallest houses, from the least well-off backgrounds. Denying these children the space and silence to study and contemplate the past that the better-off may be able to find in a spare room of their house is nothing short of social discrimination at its worst. Silent libraries will become the preserve of top universities only. Burnham will be dragging us back to before the age of improvement, to a time when only the elite could afford silence. Burnham's declaration of war on silence and history is also a veiled insult to the public, who, he assumes, have somehow become terminally incapable of accessing or understanding the kind of material their parents were able to understand, and can only digest chatter and entertainment-learning.  I have news for you, Mr Burnham. People are as intelligent as ever. Depriving the public of the space and silence to digest the thoughts of others who lived and learned before us is an insult to the public and a despicable attempt to dumb down our nation. The true progressive fights to protect the right of the public to the space for thought and understanding of things specialised and things past, in order to build a truly informed, enlightened, progressive future.</p>",

  "<p>Last month, Rwanda achieved something no other country had ever done before: produce a legislature in which <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7620816.stm\">women outnumber men</a>. The results of last month's parliamentary elections gave women 45 out of the 80 seats in the chamber of deputies, or <a href=\"http://www.unifem.org/news_events/story_detail.php?StoryID=736\">56%</a>. This surpasses Rwandan women's near parity in the outgoing parliament, already the highest proportion in the world. Rwandan President Paul Kagame praised the election results, saying that a <a href=\" http://www.nation.co.ke/News/africa/-/1066/477882/-/148sb2oz/-/\">female majority in parliament</a> \"emphasises the fact that the country's future is being shaped by women\".</p> <p>Only 14 years after the 1994 genocide, Rwanda has risen from the ashes to become a gender-equality trailblazer. Women enjoy many rights previously denied to them, including the right to own land, to open a bank account and to start a business. The government see women as critical partners to alleviate rural poverty and diversify the economy, moving from dependence on agriculture to a more knowledge-based one. To promote the role of women in politics, the constitution reserves 30% of the seats in parliament for women. The ruling party (Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF) placed many women at the top of its <a href=\"http://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2003/issue4/0403p25.asp\">lists of candidates</a>. It has also appointed numerous women to senior government posts. By March of this year, women held eight of 20 cabinet seats, including the foreign affairs portfolio. </p> <p>However, a sombre second look at the politics of Rwanda's gender revolution reveals a less optimistic interpretation of the election results. First, the vote may have been quite free (on election day), but the elections were hardly fair. Only the ruling party, its coalition partners and two other pro-RPF parties ran in the elections. No one actually ran against the government. The government had previously banned credible opposition parties and jailed, exiled or even killed many of their leaders. The buried story of the elections is how undemocratic they actually were. </p> <p>Second, even as women's visibility in politics is at an all-time high, their ability to shape the future of the country, ironically, has not improved. Rwanda's parliament has limited influence. Power is heavily concentrated in the hands of President Kagame and his close advisors. Parliamentarians \u2013 be they male or female \u2013 actually have very little power to legislate on behalf of their constituents. They have little room to develop policy or even to debate openly; space for free and open political expression is limited. </p> <p>Third, female political representation and more progressive laws have not translated into a significant improvement in the lives of the poor. Some 90% of Rwandan women are peasants who rely on subsistence agriculture. Few have benefited from the country's progressive gender policies or relatively high rates of economic growth. The gap between the living standards of some wealthy urbanites and most rural dwellers is actually increasing. Post-genocide policies favour the urban elite, many of whom are Tutsi who returned to live in Rwanda after the genocide. The vast majority of Rwandan women (and men) who survived the genocide remain extremely poor, politically marginal and, in many cases, traumatised by what they lived through. Increasing levels of authoritarianism actually stifle any attempts to address growing inequalities. </p> <p>This leads to a final point: female parliamentarians and cabinet ministers do not function independently of party politics. They do not, by virtue of their sex, automatically prioritise gender equality over the ruling party's political agenda. Rwanda's post-genocide government understandably seeks to maintain peace and security. It does so in part through a policy of national unity and reconciliation. It has banned references to ethnicity from public discourse: Rwanda is a land of all Rwandans and there no longer are any Hutu, Tutsi or Twa. Though these are arguably laudable objectives, the government uses this policy as a tool to suppress dissent and silence criticism. The RPF expects parliamentarians and other public figures to toe the party line. Those who do not are accused of \"ethnic divisionism\" or promoting \"an ideology of genocide\" and relegated to the sidelines or worse, jailed or \"disappeared\". Even aid donors are loth to criticise the government, which does not hesitate to play the genocide guilt card against them.</p> <p>The Rwandan government, representatives of the United Nations, western donors and feminist organisations celebrate Rwanda's milestone in women's parliamentary representation, claiming it is the result of enlightened attitudes and great vision. Such accounts gloss over these women's very limited role in policymaking, the continued marginalisation of the vast majority of Rwandan women, and the government's superficial commitment to democratic governance. In many ways, Rwanda's \"gender revolution\" serves as a smokescreen to distract critics from other pressing issues facing Rwandans. We should not confuse the largely symbolic achievements of gender equality with concrete progress in most women's lives, nor allow a gender lens to obscure recognition of the growing social and political inequalities in Rwanda under an often authoritarian and repressive government. The international community uncritically supported Rwanda's ethnic chauvinist government throughout the 1980s and early 1990s \u2013 with tragic results. It should not allow seemingly progressive gender policies to make it complicit in Rwanda's new politics of exclusion.</p> <p><em>Erin Baines is an assistant professor at the Liu Institute for Global Issues, University of British Columbia.

  "<p>Today in the House of Lords <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/13/terrorism-gordonbrown\">I shall vote against the government's proposal</a> to increase the maximum period of pre-charge detention to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/13/uksecurity-labour\">42 days</a>, for exactly the same reasons that I voted against its previous proposal to increase it to 90 days. Since that vote my views have been strengthened, for reasons that I will explain.</p> <p>In 1974, I commanded my regiment on the streets of West Belfast, when internment without trial was still in existence. All internal security operations depend on intelligence, not least low-level or what is called human intelligence that results from contact with ordinary citizens. Because of internment, this was almost impossible to obtain, and we operated in an atmosphere that was hostile both to us and what we were there to do.</p> <p>In 1978, I returned to Belfast to command the brigade there, by which time internment had been lifted. The contrast in atmosphere and relationships with ordinary citizens could not have been greater. There was far greater understanding of what we were there to do, and it was possible to hold meetings with local people who mattered in some degree of normality. True, women banged dustbin lids on the pavements on the night of August 9, to remind everyone that that was the date when internment was introduced in 1971, but progress was possible without that impediment.</p> <p>To me, 42 days represents internment without trial and, having experienced the difficulties it causes to the forces of law and order, in internal security operations, I could not vote to impose similar difficulties on those who have that role on our streets today.</p> <p>I am sure that many people will have read <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141030432\">The Islamist</a> by Ed Husain, which describes very vividly how difficult life is for young Muslims in Britain today. The proposed legislation has its roots in acts of terrorism perpetrated by young Muslims, resulting in an increasingly hostile public attitude towards them.</p> <p>Earlier in the year, I attended a lecture entitled <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/events-calendar/2008-events-archive/april-2008/discussion-meeting-maajid-nawaz/\">Deflating Global Islamism</a> by Maajid Nawaz, a long-time friend and university colleague of Ed Husain who, like him, had been recruited by Hizb ut-Tahrir, (the Liberation party) an extremist Islamist organisation. He had become a national speaker and international recruiter, exporting its ideology to Pakistan and then Denmark. In 2002, immediately after 9/11, he was arrested in Egypt and sentenced to five years' imprisonment for belonging to the organisation.</p> <p>On release, he and Husain resigned from Hizb ut-Tahrir and began to write and give lectures on their ideological objections to Islamism in general and the organisation in particular, launching the <a href=\"http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/\">Quilliam Foundation</a> to further that work. After his lecture, I asked Nawaz about the impact of the 42-day proposal on young, impressionable Muslims and on organisations like Hizb ut-Tahrir. \"It's the best recruiting sergeant they could get,\" was his reply.</p> <p>So why, when it is essential to do all that we can to integrate all those who successfully apply for British citizenship into our society, should we deliberately take an unnecessary step that is likely to cause, rather than solve, the very difficulties we are trying to avoid? I am delighted that current experts such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliza_Manningham-Buller\">Lady Manningham-Buller</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/peer/lord_dear\">Lord Dear</a> and, most recently, the former assistant commissioner Andy Hayman, have commented that the proposals in the bill, especially the 42-day extension, are not fit for purpose. It is absolutely true. I can only suppose that those responsible for the proposal have not thought through the practical implications for those whose job it is to maintain law and order, or for members of the public with whom, to keep that order, they must maintain good relationships.</p>",

Brown said pay and bonus policies should not reward \"short-term irresponsibility\".</p> <p>Third, bankers had to accept greater responsibility. \"We must ensure that all board members have the competence and expertise to manage the risks and so effectively supervise their institutions\".</p> <p>Fourth, rules relating to solvency and liquidity needed to reformed to ensure that banks could survive shocks to the system.</p> <p>And, fifth, a new settlement was needed to replace Bretton Woods, the system set up during the second world war that has governed financial relations between the world's major countries ever since.</p> <p>Brown went on: \"If we can coordinate national action around the principles I have set out today, then I believe we can come through these difficult times and be stronger for it \u2013 both as individual nations and as a global community.\"</p>",

  "<p>You don't have to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/weekinreview/12leonhardt.html\">break a sweat</a> to be a financial sceptic <a href=\"http://voanews.com/english/2008-10-12-voa18.cfm\">these days</a>. So let's remind ourselves how compelling the logic of the financial innovation that led us to our current predicament seemed not too long ago.</p> <p>Who wouldn't want credit markets to serve the cause of home ownership? So we start by introducing some real competition into the mortgage lending business. We allow non-banks to make home loans and let them offer creative, more affordable mortgages to prospective homeowners not well served by conventional lenders.</p> <p>Then we enable these loans to be pooled and packaged into securities that can be sold to investors, reducing risk in the process. We divvy up the stream of payments on these home loans further into tranches of varying risk, compensating holders of the riskier kind with higher interest rates.</p> <p>We then call on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating_agency\">credit rating agencies</a> to certify that the less risky of these mortgage-backed securities are safe enough for pension funds and insurance companies to invest in. In case anyone is still nervous, we create derivatives that allow investors to purchase insurance against default by issuers of those securities.</p> <p>If you wanted to showcase the benefits of financial innovation, you could not have come up with better arrangements. Thanks to them, millions of poorer and hitherto excluded families became homeowners, investors made high returns, and financial intermediaries pocketed the fees and commissions.</p> <p>It might have worked like a dream - and until about a year and a half ago, many financiers, economists, and policymakers thought that it did.</p> <p>Then it all came crashing down. The crisis that engulfed financial markets in recent months has buried Wall Street and humbled the United States.</p> <p>The near $1 trillion bailout of troubled financial institutions that the US treasury has had to mount makes emerging-market meltdowns - such as <a href=\"http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/mexico95.htm\">Mexico's peso crisis</a> in 1994 or the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/External/np/exr/facts/asia.htm\">Asian financial crisis</a> of 1997-1998 - look like footnotes by comparison.</p> <p>But where did it all go wrong? If our remedies do not target the true underlying sources of the crisis, our newfound regulatory zeal might end up killing useful sorts of financial innovation, along with the toxic kind.</p> <p>The trouble is that there is no shortage of suspects. Was the problem unscrupulous mortgage lenders who devised credit terms - such as \"teaser\" interest rates and prepayment penalties - that led unsuspecting borrowers into a debt trap?</p> <p>Perhaps, but these strategies would not have made sense for lenders unless they believed that house prices would continue to rise.</p> <p>So maybe the culprit is the housing bubble that developed in the late 1990s, and the reluctance of <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/11/greenspans-bubbles/?scp=2&amp;sq=greenspan&amp;st=cse\">Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve</a> to deflate it. Even so, the explosion in the quantity of collateralised debt obligations and similar securities went far beyond what was needed to sustain mortgage lending.</p> <p>That was also true of credit default swaps, which became an instrument of speculation instead of insurance and reached an astounding $62tn in volume.</p> <p>So the crisis might not have reached the scale that it did without financial institutions of all types leveraging themselves to the hilt in pursuit of higher returns.</p> <p>But what, then, were the credit rating agencies doing? Had they done their job properly and issued timely warnings about the risks, these markets would not have sucked in nearly as many investors as they eventually did. Isn't this the crux of the matter?</p> <p>Or perhaps the true culprits lie halfway around the world. High-saving Asian households and dollar-hoarding foreign central banks produced a global savings \"glut\", which pushed real interest rates into negative territory, in turn stoking the US housing bubble while sending financiers on ever-riskier ventures with borrowed money.</p> <p>Macroeconomic policymakers could have gotten their act together and acted in time to unwind those large and unsustainable current-account imbalances. Then there would not have been so much liquidity sloshing around waiting for an accident to happen.</p> <p>But perhaps what really got us into the mess is that the US treasury played its hand poorly as the crisis unfolded. As bad as things were, what caused credit markets to seize up was treasury secretary Henry Paulson's <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/BUSINESS/09/15/lehman.merrill.stocks.turmoil/index.html\">refusal to bail out the investment bank Lehman Brothers</a>.</p> <p>Immediately after that decision, short-term funding for even the best capitalised firms virtually collapsed and the entire financial system simply became dysfunctional.</p> <p>In view of what was about to happen, it might have been better for Paulson to hold his nose and do with Lehman what he had already done with Bear Stearns and would have had to do in a few days with AIG: save them with taxpayer money. Wall Street might have survived, and US taxpayers might have been <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21cong.html\">spared even larger bills</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps it is futile to look for the single cause without which the financial system would not have blown up in our faces. A comforting thought - if you still want to believe in financial sanity - is that this was a case of a \"perfect storm,\" a rare failure that required a large number of stars to be in alignment simultaneously.</p> <p>So what will the post-mortem on Wall Street show? That it was a case of suicide? Murder? Accidental death? Or was it a rare instance of generalized organ failure? We will likely never know.</p> <p>The regulations and precautions that lawmakers will enact to prevent its recurrence will therefore necessarily remain blunt and of uncertain effectiveness.</p> <p>That is why you can be sure that we will have another major financial crisis sometime in the future, once this one has disappeared into the recesses of our memory. You can bet your life savings on it. In fact, you probably will.</p> <p><em>In cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</em></p>",

  "<p>Sterling enjoyed a rally against the dollar today after the British government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">ramped up efforts</a> to cure the beleaguered financial sector by pumping capital into the country's biggest banks. </p> <p>Analysts said the positive response from the pound and UK stocks, both enjoying a slight bounceback after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2008/oct/10/marketturmoil\">hefty falls</a> to five-year lows last week, reflected an easing in extreme risk aversion. </p> <p>However, they warned any respite would be brief and investors should brace themselves for more volatility in coming weeks until the Treasury action takes effect. </p> <p>\"There's a little bit of risk back on the table but it is tentative. As we've seen in the past, there can be initial positive reaction to news like this, but very little patience about whether it works or not,\" said Daragh Mahe, deputy head of global FX research at Calyon. </p> <p>\"The UK plan addresses one of the issues banks are facing at the moment and that's capitalisation. The markets will hope that liquidity and the interbank aspects of life will improve as well,\" he added. </p> <p>At noon, sterling was up 0.84% at $1.73, while the euro was up against the pound at 79.48 pence. European governments also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/12/banking-europe\">agreed to provide capital</a> for banks short of funds due to a freeze-up in money markets - a move that helped the single currency gain ground against the pound. </p> <p>While markets were concentrating on news from the banking sector, the real economy is taking its lead from economic data out this week with inflation being the main focus. Unemployment figures, out on Wednesday, are expected to paint an increasingly bleak picture of the UK. However, the fall in oil prices is hoped to ease inflation.</p>",
  "<p>The government thinks that your time is worth nothing. At least, that's the implication of this written answer in the Commons last week.</p> <p>The UKip MP, Dr Bob Spink, <a href=\" http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2008-10-09a.224311.h&amp;s=speaker:11245+section:wrans#g224311.q0\">asked the environment secretary</a> \"what estimate he has made of the average time per year spent by a household in sorting and recycling rubbish.\" An important question of course, for that time spent sorting items to be recycled is obviously a cost of such recycling schemes. The answer came back from Jane Kennedy, minister of state in the department, \"No such estimate has been made\".</p> <p>An answer that means that, quite simply, we do not know whether recycling is a good idea or not. For we don't in fact know whether it costs us more to do it than we save by doing it ... for those who have imposed it upon us have not considered one of the major costs associated with doing it.</p> <p>Starting from the very beginning: your time has a value. This isn't restricted to your working hours either: the time you spend cuddling your inamorata, building a model railway or in contemplation of a pint of Old Wallop has a value to you. That is why you do these things, because you value them. If, by law, we are going to insist that you give up some of that time, to do something we tell you to do, we need to value the time you're being forced to give up. Quite what value we can put on it is a little fraught. It might be that \u00a310 an hour, something like the average wage across the country, is the right number. It might be \u00a35.73 an hour, for that is the minimum wage, the figure below which it is illegal for you to sell your time. But it is some cash amount per hour, for you yourself have already decided that you'd prefer the cuddling, modelling or contemplation rather than working that extra hour for such a sum.</p> <p>We'd also like to know how many hours you are being asked to give up to aid in the recycling effort, thus the question asked above. I've received a similar response when asking the same department directly: they don't know because they've never bothered to consider the point. There's almost no academic research on this either, the amount of time it takes to prepare to recycle. The best I've been able to find is something <a href=\" http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/006/603wxcce.asp?pg=2\">from Seattle</a>, showing that it takes a household 16 minutes per week for a simple programme and 45 minutes for one including food and garden waste. We have some 24 million households in the UK, so for a simple system we're asking everyone to give up 6 million hours a week or around 300 million a year. At minimum wage this is a \u00a31.8bn minimum cost of such a system. At the longer estimate of hours for a more complex system and using the average wage, we have a cost of \u00a39bn. These are the numbers we now need to plug into our cost benefit analysis of whether we should in fact be recycling.</p> <p>Now don't get me wrong, I'm not against all recycling: no one who has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/timworstall\">bought and sold scrap metal</a> for a living would be so stupid as to say that none of it makes sense. But we do need distinguish between things it is sensible to recycle and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/26/oilandgascompanies.taxandspending\">things that it is not</a>. Steel, aluminium, copper, yes, clearly so, these make profits even when all of the costs are included and profit is the market's way of working out whether you are in fact adding value in a process. There are also other factors that we might want to include on our benefits side, things that aren't taken account of in market pricing. Say, perhaps, the methane given off from landfills, even the aesthetics of landfills themselves. Fine, add away: then we can work out whether recycling a particular product in a particular way actually makes sense or not. We assign values to all of the costs and to all of the benefits, tot them up and if B is higher than C then it's a good idea. If C is higher than B then it's a bad one for it makes us poorer by doing it.</p> <p>It's also true that wittering on about \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/10/economics.climatechange\">saving resources</a>\" doesn't get around this point. For time itself is a resource, one with a value as above. Indeed, it's not a difficult argument to make that time is the only truly non-renewable resource that we have and thus one that we really don't want to waste.</p> <p>Now I agree that there's a little of tilting at windmills to all of this. Our targets for recycling aren't actually something in the power of our own government to alter. They are fed to us from Brussels, for matters environmental are a sole competence of the European Union. Local councils will be fined if they don't meet the targets and there's an end to the matter. </p> <p>However, a few more numbers. We were told in the <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/ENVIRONMENT/WASTE/strategy/review/index.htm\">Waste Not, Want Not report</a> that waste disposal was costing us \u00a31.6bn a year and that if we didn't do something this could rise to \u00a33.2bn. We thus needed to recycle more and reduce this cost \u2026 but hang on; recycling more also imposes this huge cost of our time. So are we in fact saving resources at all by pushing out our plans to recycle ever more of our waste? Or are we in fact consuming more resources than we're saving?</p> <p>Here at Cif there are enough environmental and green type authors whose knowledge and brains we can pick. I'm perfectly happy to agree that the numbers I've used for the valuation of our time are back-of-the envelope stuff: however, they're the only attempt so far that anyone has made at all for the UK, as above, even the government hasn't tried to calculate them. So the labour cost alone of a simple recycling scheme is some \u00a31.8bn a year and of a more extensive one, of the type being rolled out, is perhaps \u00a39bn a year. I would say that this is vastly more than any benefits that we receive from that process. It's greater than the resources saved, it's greater than any environmental benefit, greater than any reduction in transport or emissions, greater than any rational calculation of what we get back for what we're being forced to put in.</p> <p>So how about it? Caroline Lucas, George Monbiot, Oliver Tickell, Mark Lynas, Tony Juniper \u2013 there are enough people around here who should be able to prove me wrong. How much time is required to recycle, how should that time be valued, what are the benefits (valued in money please, so that we can compare costs with benefits), whether those benefits are environmental or more direct and, finally, show us that the benefits are greater than the costs. Please do add in CO2 savings for example, using the Stern review's estimate of social cost.</p> <p>And no, saying that we've a new state religion and that we should all be required to worship Gaia for an appropriate time each week won't cut it. Anyway, it should be easy to provide these numbers \u2013 even though the government clearly hasn't done a proper cost benefit analysis, surely those urging us all to recycle more will have done so \u2013 won't they?</p>",
  "<p>Nick Clegg today warned of an \"an economic 9/11\" as he suggested that the crisis in the financial markets could breed conflict, instability and nationalism. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader called on the EU to \"step up to the plate\" as he criticised European governments for being slow to produce coordinated action amid a crisis whose risks were \"borderless and global\".</p> <p>Recalling the Great Depression of the 1930s, which created the conditions for the resurgence of fascism and the outbreak of the second world war, Clegg said that he was infuriated that the generation of leaders now running Europe failed to understand that nationalism and protectionism fuelled instability.</p> <p>Extremists might find sympathy among groups who felt themselves victims of \"economic injustice\", the former MEP warned.</p> <p>In a speech made hours after the British government announced a \u00a337bn bail-out of the banking sector, and following a weekend in which European governments agreed a coordinated package of measures to deal with the financial crisis, Clegg said the financial collapse could become the \"engine of global insecurity\" in the months and years ahead. </p> <p>Clegg told an event organised by the Institute for Public Policy Research that united efforts to stabilise the global economy would prevent a gap opening up in which \"extremists can compete\".</p> <p>\"In our world, economic strength is power,\" said Clegg. \"We do not yet know, when the dust settles from this crisis, where the power will lie. The financial collapse we are caught in may prove to be an economic 9/11.</p> <p>\"9/11 was a security crisis, with security implications. This is an economic crisis, but its economic and social-security implications are potentially no less profound.\"</p> <p>Clegg said that the British bank bail-out announcement earlier today, which will see the government take a controlling stake of up to 60% in the Royal Bank of Scotland, in return for up to \u00a320bn from the taxpayer, would hopefully begin to stabilise the market.</p> <p>But he called for a greater \"political will\" within the European Union to provide supranational responses to a supranational crisis. </p> <p>Germany, France, Italy and a further 12 European countries in the eurozone last night unveiled a comprehensive plan for salvaging their banking systems from potential ruin.</p> <p>Clegg said today that the coordinated action at EU level, which he said had been \"slow in coming\", would have to be followed by more radical action, such as interest-rate cuts and more aggressive intervention, to remove the \"massive toxic liabilities\" at the heart of the banking system. </p> <p>\"We have seen European leaders agree to work together with their counterparts one day, only to take unilateral action the next,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Eurosceptics have argued, and will continue to argue, that Europe has little to offer at this time of financial crisis, that this is an Anglo-American problem that needs an Anglo-American solution. They are wrong.\"</p> <p>Outlining a five-point multilateral approach to tackling the crisis, Clegg said that European countries ought to work to tackle inequality to avoid extremism.</p> <p>\"Extremists target vulnerable and marginalised groups,\" he said.</p> <p>\"They will only find sympathy for their cause if disaffected groups feel that economic injustice has pushed them right to the edge.\"</p> <p>He rounded on European heads of government such as Brown, Angela Merkel, Silvio Berlusconi, and Nicolas Sarkozy, who he said did not \"instinctively\" share the values that European cooperation was built on.</p> <p>\"Their predecessors, the architects of the European Community, were driven by the traumas of world war two,\" said Clegg.</p> <p>\"They understood the need for national sacrifice for the wider ideals of peace, prosperity and democracy. </p> <p>\"They knew only too well that nationalism and protectionism fuel instability. But their successors need to learn these lessons anew. No one more so than Gordon Brown. Yes, he is calling for a unified European response to the crisis now and I support that, but it shouldn't have taken disaster to convince him that European coordinated action can be the only way forward. It infuriates me, as a politician with a lifelong commitment to Europe.\"</p> <p>Clegg also warned that America's \"enemies\" might seek to capitalise on the superpower's economic woes.</p> <p>The country had already lost its moral credibility due to the war in Iraq, he said. Now it risked losing its economic credibility too.</p> <p>Listing North Korea, Russia and Venezuela, Clegg said that the American \"empire\" had many enemies waiting at its gate who \"may seek to capitalise on the present upheaval\".</p> <p>Other proposals outlined by Clegg today as part of his five-point plan to restore economic security across the globe included overhauling global financial structures, such as the World Bank, building a green economy across Europe, a clear EU decision to avoid the lure of economic protectionism in response to the current turmoil, and a new regulatory framework for financial institutions across Europe.</p>",
  "<p>I hope George Osborne was watching <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/oct/13/economy-gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling's Downing Street press conference</a> this morning. In complaining that Brown ought to be blamed for his part in the global financial crisis, the shadow chancellor seems, for once, to be missing the point. Think Port Stanley, George, think Falkland Islands circa 1982. Margaret Thatcher was much to blame for that crisis, but she emerged much stronger for it. <br><br>I'll come back to that. The test of the Downing Street duo's performance this morning and, as the crisis deepened over the past few days, is whether people watching got the message. To judge by the instant response, the BBC's James Landale, and the FTSE \u2013 which dipped slightly after rising 256 points on opening \u2013 they did.</p> <p>Brown is well aware that taxpayers resent bailing out bankers who they knew were greedy but now realise were also incompetent. The American backlash hasn't materialised here yet \u2013 they do populism more readily than we do \u2013 but it could.</p> <p>So he and Darling kept stressing that, while they don't want to run the banks - \"we want to appoint directors who understand banking, not civil servants,\" said the chancellor \u2013 they do intend to curb bonuses and impose tighter regulation.</p> <p>Good, but more important still, Brown focused on banks as a necessity of life \u2013 a \"lifeline\" to small businesses and home owners - not some \"abstraction\" or luxury which can be allowed to rot. Regrettably, this is true; they're like the utilities \u2013 water, electricity, gas or, more appropriate, sewage \u2013 I suggested here the other day. We have to keep the shit flowing.</p> <p>Brown, of course, was in his element, like a pig in the aforementioned. All those dull speeches he has made down the years about greater international regulation are suddenly relevant; he was making another later today. And the three-point Brown-Darling plan to stabilise the system looks - looks - as if it will be a model for wider international action. </p> <p>Fresh from their weekend visits to Paris (eurozone) and Washington (IMF) the duo were suitably modest about that too; if you want influence you should never claim credit. </p> <p>In any case ministers are still paddling furiously under the water, their plans to curb bonuses, take ordinary shares instead of preference shares and to appoint directors all markedly different from the tone last week. But, as Darling pointed out, with the bankers now asking for so much money \u2013 \"nationalise us, please, oh please\" \u2013 it could be counterproductive to confine the option to non-voting preference shares.</p> <p>Semi-publicly, as hinted at in No 10, ministers think the taxpayers' money may yield a profit for the taxpayer in the long run. That's far too speculative a calculation. We have horrors to get through yet, including a looming recession of uncertain length. </p> <p>But Brown-Darling (Brarling?) even managed to sound optimistic about the medium-term future. Darling actually chuckled on Radio 4's Today when referring to what history might say. Hindsight is a handy gift, he admitted. </p> <p>During the No 10 press conference he also fielded questions without waiting for the prime minister's nod, always a good sign. Brown mostly looked grim, but grim is the new black at present, so that's OK.</p> <p>\"Cometh the hour, cometh the man,\" some ministers are saying. Well, that's cheeky, since some of them wanted him fired a month ago and nothing has really changed, it has merely become obvious, even to ostriches.</p> <p>Which brings me back to <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23571855-details/The+job+needs+doing++-++but+this+bail-out+is+no+triumph/article.do\">George Osborne's complaint in today's London Evening Standard</a>, that we can't blame the crisis entirely on the reckless US sub-prime housing crisis and the credit crunch it precipitated. Brown screwed up too.</p> <p>True enough. Brown rode along with City bonanza further than he should have done (so did the Tories); he also failed to keep public borrowing down in the good years, though he did \u2013 as he said again today \u2013 pay off \u00a3100bn worth of long-term public debt early on after 1997 when he was under pressure to spend it.</p> <p>But a fellow grandfather, waiting with the kids in the dodgem queue at our local fair on Saturday, got the point better. \"That bugger Brown has got away with it,\" he protested before reeling off the then-chancellor's mistakes. True, too, but so may be the \"got away with it\" verdict.</p> <p>Osborne was looking forward to his 11th birthday \u2013 just weeks away \u2013 when the blood-stained Argentine junta seized the Falkland Islands on April 2 1982. At Westminster British ministers prevaricated until after the Commons had risen, then owned up. I remember it all well.</p> <p>After the emergency Saturday debate - a shambles all round - Lord Carrington insisted on resigning as foreign secretary and the 40,000-strong Task Force was hastily assembled and sailed 8,000 miles south into winter storms just 400 miles from the enemy mainland. Disaster was widely predicted and only narrowly averted.</p> <p>But Britain prevailed and got the Falklands back. The long-suffering Argentine people got their government back. So, inevitably, did we get ours. Watching it all from the press gallery I never shared the view that Labour would have won in 1983 but for the Falklands war. Michael Foot's recent \"I was right\" on the 2008 bank nationalisation suggests he still hasn't got what was happening, bless his literary cotton socks. Labour had made itself unelectable.</p> <p>But Jim Callaghan and Denis Healey \u2013 the Brown and Darlings of the moment \u2013 were right to protest repeatedly that government inattention, cuts and complacency had allowed the invasion to happen. In the defence cuts of that winter, HMS Endurance, the navy's \"trip wire\" vessel in the region, was withdrawn, leaving just 50 squaddies at Port Stanley - who duly surrendered when faced with overwhelming odds.</p> <p>Worse, in the run-up to April 2, Callaghan, his ex-foreign secretary turned SDP defector David Owen, and the old imperial warhorse Sir Julian Amery kept warning Thatcher and her ministers in the Commons that the junta of General Leopold Galtieri was planning an invasion. They were brushed aside.</p> <p>The junta had taken the Endurance decision as a green light. There would be a brief fuss and Britain would acquiesce. The Argentine public would forgive their mass slaughter of Peronists and leftwingers. They had captured las Malvinas from the gringos!! The anti-colonial UN would forgive.</p> <p>Truly, as Jorge Luis Borges remarked, this was like two bald men fighting for a comb. But our bald Boudicca won and became the Iron Lady. Lord Franks investigated, rightly found fault, but exonerated the government in the famous last three paragraphs of his report. History is usually written by the winners. It was then.</p> <p>I realise that blog wits have made the connection and are busy writing up Brown as Galtieri. They may be proved right, but their predecessors in the letters columns said much the same of Thatcher. So did Galtieri. Fortune favours the bold, and events have forced Brown to be bold. Others are following London's lead. It may end in tears. It may save Brown. We shall see.</p>",

  "<p>The thought preoccupies me more and more as each day passes: \"What on earth should I do with all the banks that I now own?\" As the global financial crisis accelerates and deepens and I assume ownership of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">ever-longer list of banks and building societies</a>, the question has grown in urgency.</p> <p>Matters are not made easier by the fact that I am not completely sure how many banking institutions I actually do own just now. I also have an uneasy feeling that whatever answer I come up with, it will be utterly out of date by the middle of this week. It is quite possible that the majority of the key British banks will shortly be transferred to me.</p> <p>Now at this point pedants will object that, in reality, I share the privileges of bank ownership with the rest of the British people. This is perfectly true. But the government repeatedly stresses the importance of strengthening \"responsible\" share ownership and ministers have been publicly critical of the failure of existing shareholders to hold their overpaid and incompetent managers sufficiently to account. So, naturally, I want to be sure that I can live up to my new responsibilities as a very modest stakeholder in the new publicly-owned banks.</p> <p>Others will object, in an irritating, worldly-wise fashion, that the nationalisation of the banks is not really \"public\" ownership at all. They will point out that the government's nationalisation of the banks is only a form of temporary state ownership intended to save the bacon of the very rich people who until now have owned and (mis)managed these institutions so that they can be handed back to them or to their like once the public has paid for the whole, vast mess to be cleared up.</p> <p>This, I acknowledge, may well prove to be the case. But for now (and that \"now\" may prove longer lasting given the global nature of the crisis than the government would like to believe), we have to make public ownership of the banks a success. Which is why the more we, the public owners of the banks, can agree on what our banks should not be permitted to do in future and what they should be required to do, the better.</p> <p>Let us start with a few immediate, practical steps. We should require all the chairpersons and the principal executives of the failed banks and other financial institutions to resign \u2013 now. There should be no question of \"golden parachutes\" either. Moreover, parliament should immediately set up an emergency standing committee to interrogate the bankers and financiers involved in this crisis about how it was that they brought us to the brink of an economic catastrophe. Criminal investigations should also begin into those bankers and financiers suspected of fraud or other forms of malfeasance \u2013 including culpable neglect. Where the evidence exists, the bankers should be brought before the courts. Where proved guilty their assets should be seized to help pay for the astronomic losses their actions have caused.</p> <p>Now some may think these proposals a little harsh \u2013 or they may even suspect some subversive, anti-capitalist ideological motivation. I would only point out that all of the above steps have already been <a href=\"http://www.citywire.co.uk/professional/-/news/other/content.aspx?ID=315293\">urged</a> by Republicans and Democrats of impeccably pro-capitalist lineage in the US. Indeed, in many cases this kind of action \u2013 including FBI investigations \u2013 has already begun. Surely New Labour would not like to be thought less publicly-minded than the Bush administration in ensuring that those responsible for this worldwide disaster are brought to account?</p> <p>It should not be difficult to agree on what our publicly owned banks should be prevented from doing in future. This should include not trading in derivatives and other \"financial products\" about which none of them have the remotest understanding. Obviously the network of public financial regulation should be stretched to cover all financial institutions as well as all their activities on and off their balance sheets.</p> <p>We should not be too negative in devising a new approach for our banks. It is clear that banks will have to work \u2013 for the foreseeable future \u2013 in a very different environment to that in which deregulated, \"smash and grab\", short-term priorities provided the golden rules for the God-like City bankers. Our banks should rather be obliged to support the very different kind of sustainable economic development which will now be essential.</p> <p>The global society's new economic priorities should, for example, also mean that our banks give far higher priority to supporting the not-for-profit or \"third sector\" enterprises which have grown up both at home and abroad in recent decades. Our banks must also give priority to supporting enlightened forms of international economic development \u2013 such as <a href=\"http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/\">Fair Trade</a>, which may well come to play an increasingly important role in future.</p> <p>In addition, the publicly owned banks could be instructed to use their influence with those they do business with to encourage, not discourage, trade union membership and enlightened equal opportunities policies. Apart from anything else, workers are an invaluable source of expert intelligence on how their enterprises are being managed, something which our publicly owned banks will be able to benefit from now.</p> <p>Ultimately, it would not be surprising if some important banks were not so much \"nationalised\" as \"internationalised\", especially where support for the crisis-hit financial sector crosses national borders in the European Union. This could turn out to be a very fruitful form of European public ownership. It should encourage we, the owners, together with the trade unions and other civil society interests, to hammer out a longer term sustainable economic and social strategy across Europe and \u2013 maybe sooner rather than later \u2013 the world as a whole.</p>",
  "<p>UK advertisers slashed marketing budgets more savagely in the third quarter of 2008 than at any time since the IPA's Bellwether report was launched nearly a decade ago.</p> <p>The latest Bellwether report - a key indicator of the health of the UK marketing industry - was published today for the three months to the end of September. </p> <p>It found that even internet ad budgets - a perennial star performer in the survey in recent years - came under pressure during a period that began with fears that the UK was sliding into recession and ended with a global financial crisis.</p> <p>Advertisers elected to hold internet ad budgets steady in the third quarter, the weakest growth rate seen in seven years, \"contrasting with the robust growth seen in previous quarters\", the report said.</p> <p>Overall, the report found that only 12% of UK companies reported an upward revision of marketing budgets in the third quarter, while 35% reduced ad spend.</p> <p>This was the fourth successive quarterly reduction in UK ad spend recorded by the Bellwether report and \"points to a marked deterioration in business conditions since the summer\", it said.</p> <p>Hardest hit were budgets for \"main media advertising\", including TV, radio and press advertising.</p> <p>Bellwether's \"all other\" category, which includes PR, events sponsorship and market research, also saw record downward revisions.</p> <p>\"I doubt these gloomy results will come as a surprise to anyone,\" said Moray MacLennan, the president of ad agency trade body the IPA.</p> <p>\"In light of current headlines, the biggest surprise may well be that 12% of companies' budgets were revised upwards.\"</p> <p>Companies attributed the cutting of budgets to lower-than-anticipated sales and profits - in turn reflecting weaker consumer and corporate demand - as well as growing concerns about the economy.</p> <p>The latest downward revision in the Bellwether report indicates that UK companies are having a crisis of confidence in the state of the economy - unsurprising given the ever deepening financial crisis engulfing Europe and the US.</p> <p>Just 8% of companies were more optimistic about prospects for the UK advertising industry than they were three months ago, compared with 69% that are now less optimistic.</p> <p>When asked about the prospects for their own companies, 13% cited greater confidence in performance than three months ago, against 54% who are now less confident in the outlook.</p> <p>\"The slump in the Bellwether marketing budget and financial prospects data indicate a severe worsening of business confidence,\" said Chris Williamson, the chief economist at business information company Markit, which produces the report for the IPA. </p> <p>\"[It also shows] the rising impact of the credit crunch on the real economy, as companies rein in spending in the face of poor sales and growing fears over the economy.\"</p> <p>Williamson added that the Bellwether report was consistent with other data showing the UK economy contracting in the third quarter \"raising the possibility of the UK falling into recession\".</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>The Bank of England was given more leeway to cut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">interest rates</a> today as producer prices continued to fall in September, indicating that factory gate inflation may have peaked.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said that producer output prices fell 0.3% in the month to September after dropping 0.7% in August. They fell to 8.5% in the year to September from 9.1% in August and a peak of 10% in July. </p> <p>\"The further retreat in producer output and input prices in September reinforces belief that underlying inflationary pressures have peaked even though annual consumer price inflation could well have climbed to 5.0% in September,\" said Howard Archer at consultants Global Insight.</p> <p>Producer prices are seen as an early warning signal of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">inflationary pressure</a> in the shops.</p> <p>\"The softer producer price data will facilitate further interest rate cuts by the Bank of England, although the timing and extent of these will be heavily influenced by financial crisis developments and the extent to which these are feeding through to hit economic activity.

We currently forecast interest rates to fall to 3% on 2009, but they could well come down further still,\" added Archer. </p> <p>The Bank slashed 50 basis points off rates last week in its first emergency cut since the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, leaving them at 4.5%.<br></p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a> today said British taxpayers would benefit from the government's decision to pump up to \u00a337bn into the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup\">Royal Bank of Scotland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lloydstsbgroup\">Lloyds TSB</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/hbos\">HBOS</a> in an attempt to prevent UK <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">banking</a> meltdown.</p> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/12/banking-economy\">weekend negotiations</a>, which continued through last night, the Treasury unveiled an unprecedented banking rescue plan earlier today.</p> <p>The scheme will see bank bosses facing a crackdown on pay and bonuses, and shareholder dividends will be frozen. </p> <p>The government will take a controlling stake in RBS in return for up to \u00a320bn from the taxpayer. </p> <p>Alistair Darling told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that total ownership in RBS, through a combination of ordinary and preference shares, would be 60%, with the figure for HBOS 40%.</p> <p>The chancellor refused to speculate on how long the state ownership of bank shares would continue, but insisted the move to stabilise banks was an investment that would benefit the taxpayer.</p> <p>\"There is every reason to be confident that, as we go through this, the British taxpayer will get his money back,\" he told the BBC. </p> <p>\"There is a distinction between what we have done here and the borrowing that governments incur on a day-to-day basis. </p> <p>\"These conditions just now are exceptional and extraordinary and it is right that the government supports the economy ... but I am very mindful of the fact that the government needs to keep lending under control.\"</p> <p>Asked when the state shares would be refloated, he said he did not think it \"would be wise to speculate on when this is going to happen\".</p> <p>\"We will do whatever it takes for as long as it takes,\" he added. \"Ultimately, we want to return the banks to private sector because I don't think the government can run them in the long run.\"</p> <p>Questioned on whether nationalisation meant all deposits would be protected, Darling said: \"Given the stakehold we have in this bank, that sends a pretty clear message.\"</p> <p>He said RBS and HBOS would continue to be run on a commercial basis and at arms' length from the government. </p> <p>The government had been forced to act because the banks had no other way to get the money they needed to stay afloat, he added.<br> \"Our intention is stabilisation and reconstruction,\" he said. \"That is the objective, and that is what I intend to see through.\"</p> <p>Darling said other countries should take similar measures to deal with what was a \"truly global problem\".</p> <p>\"We are living in extraordinarily turbulent times,\" he said. </p> <p>\"As long as governments the world over are prepared to take decisive action ... I think there are good reasons to believe that this will be seen as a very significant step along the way to getting through this.\" </p> <p>He admitted that lessons needed to be learned on both domestic regulation and the international stage.</p> <p>\"The regulation system needs to face up to the global consequences,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Normally, Proceeding and Unrestricted With Without Title 2008, by Gelitin<br>Psycho Buildings, Hayward Gallery, London</strong></p> <p>For many the concept of a boating lake in an art gallery is obscene: galleries are a place for quiet contemplation. Yet the hour-long queue to board a boat at the Hayward shows otherwise - even those accustomed only to painting and sculpture seemed to have embraced Gelitin's perplexingly named installation art.</p> <p>An unstable set of stairs leads you up to an equally rudimentary platform: the marina. Plywood is stuck together with Polyfilla and foam-filled water cooler bottles amazingly providing suitable flotation. The boats are also made from simple, \"found\" materials, perhaps harking back to the arte povera movement of the 1960s, and feel as though they could have been knocked up in a few Sunday afternoons by father and son.</p> <p>From the filled-in tray of an outside sculpture gallery, we have a view of London. The four boats are sandwiched between the Festival Hall, the Shell building and the rest of the Hayward, many feel not the most attractive of buildings (although like a small minority I feel that the Hayward is not a brutalist monster but a building of beauty). Gelitin, the Austrian arts four-piece, have made this with parodic intent, intending to bring a tranquil lake to the hubbub of the city, and it most certainly juxtaposes with the buildings around: the distant soundtrack of trains chugging and car horns beeping only adds to the effect.</p> <p>They have brought with them one of the romantic lakes of their home country and placed it in the centre of London. Yet one feels as though there is more to Gelitin's typically humorous work than just combining surreal serenity with aggressive architecture. They have singled out art's famous lakes; Seurat's Bathers at Asni\u00e8res, Dal\u00ed's Metamorphosis of Narcissus. Or perhaps the floods have finally come to London and we are trying to escape; global warming has taken its toll and we have to frantically row away.</p>",
  "<p>Have you ever thought you'd like to help young women free themselves from all that male-driven cultural conditioning, and instead learn to love themselves for the people they are inside? <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0937748/\">Fred Wolf</a>, the father of two girls, has let it be known that he harboured just this ambition. So he was knocked out when Columbia Pictures offered him the chance to fulfil it.</p> <p>His was to be the privilege of directing <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0852713/\">The House Bunny</a>, a wacky but heart-warming comedy about an alumna of the <a href=\"http://www.playboy.com/worldofplayboy/hmh/mansion/\">Playboy Mansion</a> who finds fulfilment through self-realisation in the world beyond its walls. Her journey, Wolf hoped, might inspire his own beloved daughters.</p> <p>Not, of course, that there's anything wrong with life as a bunny-girl, at least in this film. The Mansion depicted in The House Bunny is a near-paradise of camaraderie, fun, joy and love. A former inmate, <a href=\"http://www.izabellastjames.com/\">Izabella St James</a>, provided a less favourable account of life inside (complete with curfews and weekly assessments) in a book called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Bunny-Tales-Izabella-St-James/dp/0762427396\">Bunny Tales</a>, published in 2006. Nonetheless, we shouldn't be too surprised that the film paints a somewhat rosier picture.</p> <p>For Columbia and the Playboy guys came to an understanding. The film-makers were provided with access to the real Playboy Mansion, even to the very tabernacle that is bunnymaster <a href=\"http://uk.askmen.com/celebs/men/feb00/12_hugh_hefner.html\">Hugh Hefner</a>'s bedroom. The octogenarian Hefner, who's shown as treating his charges with unfailing warmth and concern, is played by Hefner himself. Fortunately, he manages to bring to the role all the charm, benignity and compassion that it seems to require.</p> <p>Understandably, the film's heroine, Shelley (played by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0267506/\">Anna Faris</a>), is having the time of her life in his temple of bliss. Nonetheless, Wolf's mission cannot allow her to remain in thrall to male desire, however benignly it's manifested. So he plucks her from the Mansion's bosom and flings her onto the path to self-discovery in our own less cloistered world.</p> <p>Almost immediately, she stumbles into what's effectively a mirror-image of the Playboy Mansion. It's a sorority house peopled by ugly, nerdy and grimly unsexy bluestockings. The film's central contrivance is that she'll teach them how to scrub up and get laid, while they'll teach her how to find her inner self. Unfortunately, the former exercise proves more persuasive than the latter. The ugly ducklings do indeed take wing under Shelley's tutelage; but her own reward for spiritual metamorphosis turns out to be the heart of a care home manager so dreary and right-minded that even the wizened, spectral Hef begins to seem attractive in comparison.</p> <p>In the end, the Playboy Mansion's undiminished allure far outshines the dubious appeal of the brutish world beyond its bounds. On the latter's mean campuses, women may indeed create their own essence, but it's far from clear that the effort involved is worth the price it exacts.</p> <p>Well, you have to hand it to Hef. He knows a thing or two about publicity. There's already a hit reality-TV show called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fujy5iVQYJU\">The Girls of the Playboy Mansion</a>, and a biopic is on the way. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?xml=/portal/2008/09/21/st_hughhefner.xml\">According to Hefner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000375/\">Robert Downey Jr</a> is interested in playing him, whatever Hollywood's normally sanctimonious elite may think of his line of business. </p> <p>Believe it or not, the arrangement that brought us The House Bunny required Columbia to pay Playboy, rather than the other way round (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/series/betweenthelines\">Between the Lines</a> can exclusively reveal). Hef was paid a further sum for his admittedly passable acting. </p> <p>Let's hope that the director's daughters do indeed find the film that's resulted instructive. Sadly, however, it may impress the little Wolflettes less with the desirability of female empowerment than with the power of product placement.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>8:59am:</strong> On The Week in Westminster on Saturday Jackie Ashley suggested a good way of judging how serious the financial crisis is: how happy does Gordon Brown look? Like other commentators, she was making the point that as the crisis has got worse and worse, Brown has appeared more and more confident.</p> <p>Well, we'll see what he looks like this morning because he's about to give a press conference in Downing Street. He's just spent \u00a337bn on buying up stakes in two banks (more than was anticipated last week), so in one respect things look pretty grim. But, as I write, the markets are going up, which is good for the economy. So maybe he won't be quite that perky after all.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>9:05am:</strong> I've just had a quick look at the <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_105_08.htm\">Treasury statement about the bail-out</a>. I expect there will be huge interest in the issue of bonuses, but the statement suggests that the \"no bonuses this year\" policy only applies to board members. What about everyone else who may or may not have contributed to the banks' plight? And it says \"no cash bonuses\". That sounds to me like a loophole.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>9:08am:</strong> Robert Peston's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2008/10/momentous_monday.html\">Momentous Monday</a> blog is worth a read.</p> <p>Brown is here now. He says he's implementing the plan he announced yesterday.</p> <p>In \"extraordinary times ... the government cannot just leave people on their own to be buffeted about\".</p> <p>There are two announcements today, Brown says.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>9:08am:</strong> First, British banks are being strengthened by the injection of almost \u00a350bn of new capital. (The government is investing \u00a337bn, but Barclays has agreed to raise money privately to recapitalise.)</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>9:09am:</strong> As part of the plan, there will be conditions. The government is \"bringing an end to rewards for failure\".</p> <p>Four senior board members are leaving their posts today.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>9:09am:</strong> The government's ideal is fair reward for hard work, not incentives for risk-taking.</p> <p>No dividends will be paid until the government has received its dividend payments.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>9:10am:</strong> And the banks will have to carry on lending to home-buyers and small businesses.</p> <p>Second, the Treasury is announcing details of the guarantees that will underwrite inter-bank lending.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>9:13am:</strong> Brown says he \"warmly welcomes\" the fact that the eurozone economies are taking action to strengthen their banks.</p> <p>\"I believe that only by global action .. can we fully restore confidence.\"</p> <p>Brown will be unveiling details of his plans to strengthen the international banking system in a speech he's giving this morning at 10.30am.</p> <p>He says that banking is not a luxury. It's essential for ordinary people.</p> <p>The most important asset is confidence.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>9:14am:</strong> Darling is talking now. He's summarising the announcement the Treasury made earlier.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>9:16am:</strong> Across the world, governments are ready to do \"whatever it takes\".</p> <p>Nick Robinson of the BBC says that nationalisation was seen as a bad thing in the past. How will Brown ensure that these nationalisations are not bad for the economy?</p> <p>Brown's not looking that cheerful this morning. So, according to the Ashley test, things are probably looking up for the economy.</p> <p>In his response to Robinson, Brown stresses that the government's holdings in the banks will be \"temporary\". He says he thinks \"a large number\" of other governments will follow the UK's lead.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>9:17am:</strong> Darling says the banks will be run at \"arm's length\" from government. Ministers will not be taking day-to-day decisions. \"We don't want to be in the business of running banks.\"</p> <p>Adam Boulton of Sky News asks where the \u00a337bn is coming from, and what the implications are for government borrowing.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>9:18am:</strong> And he asks for more detail about dividend payments.</p> <p>Brown says he thinks the value of the shares the government is buying will grow.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9:19am:</strong> In the pre-budget report the government will reveal what the implications are for debt. But the government has cut debt in the past, which has put it in a strong position.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9:19am:</strong> The conditions are designed to satisfy the public in relation to the concerns people have about the way banks have behaved.</p> <p>Darling says there is a distinction to be made between this sort of investment, where the taxpayer will get his or her money back, and general government borrowing.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9:20am:</strong> If the government did not act, the consequences would be worse.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>9:21am:</strong> Darling says most of the RBS and Lloyds TSB/HBOS shares are ordinary shares, not preference shares. The Treasury will be holding a technical briefing later.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>9:22am:</strong> A journalist asks Brown if he can understand why people will be \"aghast\" when they see the figures.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>9:23am:</strong> Brown says there will be no cash bonuses this year. Next year, bonuses will have be paid as a reward for hard work. So the government is taking \"tough action\".</p> <p>\"We believe that these are investments made at the bottom of the market that will yield returns in future.\"</p> <p>On Iceland, Darling said he met the Icelandic finance minister at the weekend in Washington.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>9:24am:</strong> The Icelandic government is reflecting on what it needs to do.</p> <p>There will be an announcement about Landsbanki soon, he says. In the meantime he will do \"everything\" to protect UK interests.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>9:25am:</strong> Brown says that if there are grounds for an investigation, they will happen (which seems to be a way of ducking the question).</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>9:27am:</strong> Jon Snow of Channel 4 News asks Brown if he knows what he's buying into.</p> <p>Brown says that's why it's important to strengthen the banks. The Treasury has been looking at these issues (presumably the extent of toxic debt). But the key thing is to have strong banks.</p> <p>Darling says he has \"quite deliberately taken a cautious approach\" in assessing the banks' capital requirement (ie the amount of capital they are required to hold by regulators to cover the risks).</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>9:28am:</strong> Andrew Porter from the Daily Telegraph asks who the government-nominated independent directors will be. And he also asks about the departure of Sir Fred Goodwin from RBS, pointing out that Brown and Darling claimed last week that Goodwin's removal was not a condition of RBS getting support.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>9:30am:</strong> Darling says the RBS board dealt with Goodwin's departure.</p> <p>And he says that the government-nominated directors will be banking experts.</p> <p>Graeme Wilson from the Sun asks if the bonus ban only applies to board members.</p> <p>Darling says that he does not want people lower down the organisation not to be rewarded for doing good things. But he expects that, nearer the top of the banks, the bonus ban could also apply.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>9:31am:</strong> Brown says that in future bonuses should only be paid as a reward for hard work.</p> <p>Change of subject. James Landale asks Brown what he will do if the Lords votes down 42 days.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>9:34am:</strong> Brown says the Lords should follow the lead of the Commons, but that he won't \"presume\" what might happen if they don't.</p> <p>James Lyons from the Mirror asks about the pay-offs that departing directors may receive.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>9:37am:</strong> Brown says Sir Fred Goodwin has decided not to accept a pay-off. But he doesn't say anything about the other three directors leaving their posts.</p> <p>William Green from the Newcastle Journal asks Brown what he thinks about councils that have invested in Icelandic banks.</p> <p>Brown passes the question onto Darling, who says he has taken steps to freeze Lansbanki assets in the UK. He will continue to discuss the problem with local authorities.</p> <p>A Bloomberg journalist asks if it is \"prudent\" for the banks to continue with 2007 lending policies, given that that was the year when the problems started.</p> <p>Darling says these policies were agreed by the banks, and that they would not have signed up to the policy if they did not think it was sensible.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>9:37am:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/deborahsummers\">Deborah Summers</a> from the Guardian asks Brown if he thinks the public are on his side.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>9:40am:</strong> Brown says people are worried. He wants to assure people he's stabilising the system. People want to know this is not at the expense of spending on schools etc (which, he implies, it isn't). And businesses want to know that they will be able to borrow again. Today's package will address this.</p> <p>Ben Brogan of the Daily Mail asks Brown if he accepts that the regulatory regime he set up has failed.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>9:41am:</strong> Brown says we've had a situation where a lot of bank liabilities were not on balance sheet. (Interestingly, this is one of the charges against Brown: the Tories claim that PFI liabilities aren't included in the national accounts.) On Northern Rock, Brown says that the Financial Services Authority has accepted it made mistakes.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>9:42am:</strong> Darling says that before the FSA was set up on 1997 there were too many regulators and the system was fragmented. The Americans are now following the UK single regulator model, he says.</p> <p>But there has been too much risk-taking by banks, he accepts.</p> <p>The UK needs a robust regulatory system. But it also needs a system that takes account of the way banks relate to each other internationally. International supervision needs to be \"very significantly strengthened\".</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>9:45am:</strong> Joe Murphy from the London Evening Standard asks if this will be the \"last call\" on the taxpayer. And what happens if other countries don't follow the UK's lead?</p> <p>Brown says he will do \"whatever it takes\". \"This is the first financial crisis of the global age,\" he says. The oil crisis is part of this \"remaking of the world on a global basis\". He needs international cooperation, because there is a limit to what the UK can do on its own. </p> <p>\"The more international cooperation, the better ... This is not just the time to stabilise the system, it's the time to sort it out.\"</p> <p>Gary Gibbon picks up on the \"first financial crisis of the global age\" quote - a powerful one - and asks Brown what banking will look like in the future.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>9:46am:</strong> Brown says the long-term prospects are good. The global economy will double in the next 20 years. And that means there will be a demand for banking.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>9:46am:</strong> \"Once we deal with these problems, you can see the huge opportunities available for British business and British talent in years to come,\" Brown says.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>9:48am:</strong> The principle of reward for hard work - ie his new bonus policy for the City - is the basis for business success in the future.</p> <p>Darling says the opportunities in the future are tremendous.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>9:48am:</strong> As for how long the government will carry on owning bank shares, Darling says \"as long as it takes\". But he also says that the government does not want to be in the business of running banks.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>9:49am:</strong> <a href=\"http:www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour\">Patrick Wintour</a> from the Guardian asks if there is a case for an official inquiry into what went wrong. And why did Brown make Alan Greenspan his official adviser when he's now being blamed for the crisis. (There's an argument that he kept interest rates too low for too long.)</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>9:50am:</strong> Brown defends his chum Greenspan. He says he was the first to spot the problems.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>9:52am:</strong> As for an inquiry, he says his priority is to deal with the problem. He says that \"articles will be written\", but it sounds like he's not very keen at all on one (although he didn't categorically rule one out).</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>9:53am:</strong> With that, the press conference ends.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Instant summary</strong></p> <p><strong>Persuading the public:</strong> After Brown announced the outline of his bail-out package last week, the reaction at Westminster was almost universally positive. But Downing Street quickly picked up evidence suggesting that the public at large was far less impressed by the prospect of so much taxpayers' money being shelled out on the banks. Today Brown was trying hard to persuade people that the package really is essential. Banks were a \"lifeline\", he said.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>Bonuses: </strong>Promising a clampdown on bonuses is an essential part of this strategy. Brown was more explicit on this than he was last week, and he repeatedly called for a new approach to bonuses. But, when questioned about this, Darling confirmed that the \"no cash bonus\" policy for a nationalised bank like RBS will only apply to board members, and that more junior bankers could still be allowed to pocket large sums. </p> <p>Brown was also evasive when asked about pay-offs to executives who are leaving. He said Sir Fred Goodwin, the RBS chief executive, won't be walking off with a golden parachute, but he did not rule out other executives receiving enormous pay-offs. There's considerable anger in parliament and among the public at large at the prospect of bankers being \"rewarded for failure\", and it's not clear yet whether the Brown conditions will be enough to assuage this.</p> <p><strong>The future's bright:</strong> In some ways, Brown's most interesting comments were the ones he made about the long-term future of the economy. He said that with the global economy set to double in size over the next 20 years, there's going to be a lot of banking business that could come to London. It's a bold argument to make on a day like this, but Brown understands global finance better than most of us and it will be interesting to see whether people believe him.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Rock of stability:</strong> This was the phrase Brown used to describe the role of government at a time of financial instability. Perhaps it's not the best phrase. \"Northern Rock of stability\", a colleague joked.</p>",
  "<p>At a <a href=\"http://www.reform.co.uk/\">Reform</a> roundtable breakfast last week, Vince Cable MP, the prolific and much-revered Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, warned of a new wave of economic nationalism arising in response to the current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">economic crisis</a>. People are rediscovering government, he suggested, but not in a good way \u2013 instead of looking for creative and innovative leadership, there is increasing demand for state intervention and a danger of returning to 1930s protectionism.</p> <p>Particularly over the last week, a number of governments have demonstrated signs of this \"every man for himself\" attitude, not least in Europe. Wednesday's coordinated interest rate cut was a welcome exception to this, but it isn't enough.</p> <p>This isn't a British crisis, it isn't a European crisis, it isn't even an American crisis \u2013 this is a global crisis and, despite unique causes, circumstances and events in each country, our response will be stronger and more effective if we work in concert with other leading economies.</p> <p>The growing clamour for state intervention \u2013 in the markets, in banking, in every aspect of our economic wellbeing \u2013 is both understandable and, perhaps, overstated; <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/peter_riddell/article4908816.ece\">Peter Riddell</a> pointed out in the Times that \"comparisons with past Labour commitments to nationalisation are alluring but misleading since ministers will not run the banks\". But there are some extremely important issues around regulation and protecting the taxpayer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/borisjohnson/3097594/Tory-party-conference-Boris-Johnson-freezes-London-council-tax-precept.html\">Boris Johnson</a> came under fire last week for saying that \"you cannot regulate your way out of a recession\". He's right, of course, but the political situation is such that the public demand for assurances that this won't happen again needs to be heeded. Whatever decisions are made over the coming weeks and months, it is essential the government doesn't use the crisis, intentionally or inadvertently, to stifle the prospects of a bounceback in the financial sector's health.</p> <p>Similarly, with the taxpayer spending \u00a325bn to \u00a3500bn (depending on how you count it) on Britain's banks, it is important this public investment is protected. The initial omens look good \u2013 indeed, with luck, there is every chance the taxpayer could make a profit. But in finalising the details of the agreement, it is essential that the public purse is protected. </p> <p>Whatever the short-term implications for debt, tax and spending, it is crucial that we do not allow a quick fix to turn into a financial hangover that will plague the next generation.</p>",
  "<h2>The Film</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/78178/breakfast.at.tiffany.s\">Breakfast at Tiffany's</a> (1961) is a film by Blake Edwards from a story by Truman Capote. The film is remembered as providing a signature role for Audrey Hepburn, along with Roman Holiday (1953) rather than, say, The Nun's Story (1959). Henry Mancini's song, Moon River, performed by Hepburn, was awarded an Oscar.</p> <p>The film has proved enduringly popular. The story of Holly Golightly combines romantic comedy with the polished sophistication of New York's upper east side. The relaxed nonchalance of the main characters exemplifies the style of New York as the centre of a chic, cocktail-hour glamour. This was perfectly in tune, at the beginning of the 1960s, with the kinds of images being produced by NYC's Madison Avenue advertising creatives to support the emergence of a credit-fuelled form of leisure society based on aspiration-driven consumption.</p> <p>Accordingly, the figure of Holly Golightly may be understood as an enduringly powerful cipher for this kind of benign social mobility.</p> <h2>The Girl</h2> <p>Fashion is, nowadays, probably the most highly developed branch of popular semiotics. A raft of magazines provides clues, on a monthly and weekly basis, as to the cultural value of certain shoes, bags and frocks.</p> <p>Back in the 1950s, before Breakfast, the fashion system was basically a couture industry that supplied hand-made garments for the social and aristocratic elite. The ready-to-wear retail phenomenon was unknown. The conservative fashion press in America chose its models from the eastern seaboard WASP elite. The daughters of European aristocracy were especially favoured for modelling with their old world and old money associations.</p> <p>The photo shoots were studio based, static affairs, which showed these exquisite girls in ball gowns and cocktail dresses. The elaboration of a consumer society with a mass-market fashion system would require, it was clear to strategists, a different kind of model and a different kind of dress. The new woman would by dynamic, autonomous and relaxed.</p> <p>Within the film and fashion system, Audrey Hepburn was positioned as a kind of mid-point transition between the cool, aristocratic, sophistication of Grace Kelly and down-home, keen-as-mustard charm of Doris Day.</p> <p>In this context, it's worth itemising the Audrey Hepburn look in detail</p> <p><strong>The LBD:</strong> The classic little black dress by French couture house Givenchy was the pass partout of cocktail sophistication. Its relative simplicity gave it practical convenience that allowed women to move effortlessly between the different dress codes of work and evening wear.</p> <p><strong>The Rocks:</strong> The eponymous Tiffany and Co. supplied the jewellery. Tiffany's are part of the mythology of the aspirational American dream, supplying diamonds, silverware and engagement presents to the American elite since the 1850s. Beyond the jewels, their store, located on Fifth Avenue, with their distinctive pale blue wrapping has become synonymous with American retail sophistication.</p> <p><strong>The Shoes:</strong> Audrey Hepburn was a great shoe model who popularised the kitten heel. This shoe, like the LBD, allowed the easy transition from statuesque glamour to dynamic action. The shoe had just enough heel height to be both practical and elegant.</p> <p><strong>The Cigarette Holder:</strong> Probably the only item that, some fifty years later, is questionable. Back in the 1960s, the cigarette companies were still able to promote their products as sophisticated by association with Hollywood.</p> <p>Together these elements combine, in a powerful and compounded form of signification and around the screen personality of Audrey Hepburn, to provide a dynamic and relaxed re-invention of the It Girl for 1960s Madison Avenue.</p> <h2>The City</h2> <p>The relatively small island of Manhattan provides for a wide variety of social geographies. The Little Italy, Chinatown and Hell's Kitchen areas are well known to cinema audiences. More recently, the upper east, and west, sides have become a staple of Woody Allen's neuroses-driven plot lines.</p> <p>Breakfast inhabits the same social geography, but without the therapy. The film and its protagonists are untroubled by the pathology of excessive consumption that has characterised Fifth Avenue in last couple of decades.</p> <h2>Sex and the City</h2> <p>It's pretty obvious from what I've said that Breakfast can be understood as a prototype for the hugely successful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/124001/sex.and.the.city\">Sex and the City</a>. Indeed, Audrey Hepburn's position as poster girl for the SATC generation has become secure.</p> <p>It's no coincidence then, that as the SATC franchise has developed, the fashion press have relentlessly promoted Hepburn as a role model and style icon.</p> <h2>The Poster</h2> <p>The minimalist design of the Breakfast poster effectively concentrates attention on the semiotic construction of Holly Golightly's screen persona. Only the cat and the rain soaked clinch allude to anything beyond a round of cocktail parties.</p> <p>In recent years, this poster has become a staple of vintage film poster auctions. Apart from the obvious attractions of Hepburn, the popularity of the poster rests entirely on it expressing, some fifty years later and across a global mass market, the zeitgeist of a consumer-driven pursuit of material sophistication.</p> <h2>Audrey Hepburn</h2> <p>It's worth pointing out that Hepburn was an actress and that the role of Holly Golightly didn't necessarily reflect her own personality and taste.</p> <p>Hepburn was born in Belgium and was connected to minor European aristocracy. Her experiences during WW2 gave her a sense of perspective from which to judge the fashion and film industries. From the mid-1950s onwards, she was an effective ambassador for the UNICEF.</p>",
  "<p>With continuing exceptional instability in the global financial markets, the government is today taking decisive action, by implementing the comprehensive set of measures it announced on October 8, to make commercial investments in UK banks and building societies to help stabilise their position and support the long-term strength of the economy.</p> <p>The overall aim of these measures is to support stability in the financial system; to protect ordinary savers, depositors, businesses and borrowers; and to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer. In summary, the measures intend to:</p> <p>\u2022 provide sufficient liquidity in the short term;</p> <p>\u2022 make available new tier 1 capital to UK banks and building societies to strengthen their resources permitting them to restructure their finances, while maintaining their support for the real economy, through the recapitalisation scheme which has been made available to eligible institutions; and</p> <p>\u2022 ensure that the banking system has the funds necessary to maintain lending in the medium term through the credit guarantee scheme available to eligible institutions in relation to new short and medium term debt issuance.</p> <p>The authorities have continued their detailed discussions with the institutions who confirmed their participation in the recapitalisation scheme last week. These institutions committed in aggregate to increase their total tier 1 capital, either through their own actions or, where requested, through support from the Government's recapitalisation scheme in the form of preference and ordinary share capital. </p> <p>The government is making capital investments to RBS, and upon successful merger, HBOS and Lloyds TSB, totaling \u00a337bn.</p> <p>Following the completion of these capital investments, each of the above institutions will have a Tier 1 capital ratio in excess of 9%, well above international minimum standards and at a level that should put them on a strong footing for the future.</p> <p>All participating institutions are eligible to take advantage of the government's credit guarantee scheme. The Debt Management Office is today announcing the general arrangements for operating the scheme. Further details relating to fees, the period under which guarantees will be issued and the application process can be found in the Market Notice which is being published by DMO at: <a href=\"http://www.dmo.gov.uk\">www.dmo.gov.uk</a>.</p> <p>As part of its investment, the government has agreed with the banks supported by the recapitalisation scheme a range of commitments covering:</p> <p>\u2022 maintaining, over the next three years, the availability and active marketing of competitively priced lending to homeowners and to small businesses at 2007 levels;</p> <p>\u2022 support for schemes to help people struggling with mortgage payments to stay in their homes, and to support the expansion of financial capability initiatives;</p> <p>\u2022 remuneration of senior executives - both for 2008 (when the government expects no cash bonuses to be paid to board members) and for remuneration policy going forward (where incentive schemes will be reviewed and linked to long-term value creation, taking account of risk; and restricting the potential for 'rewards for failure');</p> <p>\u2022 the right for the government to agree with boards the appointment of new independent non-executive directors; and</p> <p>\u2022 dividend policy.</p> <p>The recapitalisations are designed to enable participating banks to achieve prudent but efficient capital structures. The government intends to create a new arms length body to manage the government's shareholdings in recapitalised institutions on a professional and wholly commercial basis, and seek to effectively realise value to the taxpayer. Transparent arrangements will be put in place to ensure that any role for the government in relation to investment decision-making is clearly defined. The government is not a permanent investor in UK banks. Its intention, over time, is to dispose of all the investments it is making as part of this scheme in an orderly way. To reflect the implementation of the scheme, the government will tomorrow announce a revised debt remit for the Debt Management Office. Further information is available at: <a href=\"http://www.dmo.gov.uk\">www.dmo.gov.uk</a>. </p> <p>The measures the government is announcing today support stability in the wider financial system, and protect the interest of taxpayers, depositors and savers.</p> <p>The government has informed the European commission of the schemes. The government stands ready to provide support through the schemes to all eligible institutions, on the basis of the conditions set out in its announcement last week.</p> <p>The government is continuing to collaborate internationally to stabilise and strengthen the global financial system, following the meetings of G7 and G20 finance ministers and the IMF on Friday and Saturday. Other countries have announced measures to stabilise their own financial systems.</p> <p>In parallel with other central banks, the Bank of England is today announcing expanded swap lines with the US Federal Reserve and that the Bank will supply dollar liquidity to the banking system against collateral at a pre-set price with no fixed limit on the amount. The Bank will continue to take all actions necessary to ensure that the banking system has access to sufficient liquidity.</p> <p>With the first successful implementation of the schemes announced last week now completed, the government has taken decisive and extraordinary action to support the banking system during this period of exceptional financial turbulence, and to strengthen the system for the future as markets stabilise.</p>",
  "<p>Further to my posting on the gloomy set of September circulation figures for national newspapers, I am now able to cast some light on the marketing side. I mentioned that <strong>News International's</strong> titles were doing better than their rivals, but I was unable to obtain information about comparative marketing spends by the groups.</p> <p>Well, I still haven't been able to do that with any accuracy. However, in making the attempt, I did turn up some facts that are certainly worth noting.</p> <p>Newspapers' television marketing spend in September was way down on what it was in the same month in 2007. The daily titles enjoyed boosts from only eight major TV promotions compared to 13 last year, while the Sundays had to make do with 13 TV promotions compared to 19 the year before. Several papers had no promotional support of any kind. </p> <p>Owners have always been sceptical about the enormous sums required for marketing, especially the cost of TV advertising. The cost of securing sales spikes is often - very often - disproportionate to the outlay. </p> <p>But the gradual retreat by some groups from TV to support promotions is also counter-productive. There is, after all, little point in a paper giving away DVDs and CDs unless people outside the title's core audience know about them. </p> <p>And all this before the real effects of the global financial crisis kick in. Though people are anxious to know what is happening to the banks, and their own money, there is little sign of them buying more newsprint. Television and the net appears to be the media of first choice.</p>",
  "<p>Riding with us in our RV near his office in Culver City last week, a silver-haired <a href=\"http://www.tomhayden.com/\">Tom Hayden</a> says with a hint of irony, but not a trace of resignation - \"I am just an old politician.\"</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338523504\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1851740570_Tom-Hayden.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Forty years ago, Hayden stood as the voice of youth. He was a founder of Students for a Democratic Society, participated in the civil rights movement, and became a leading anti-war activist, traveling to North Vietnam with his future wife, Jane Fonda. He was one of the Chicago Eight, charged with inciting riot at the 1968 Democratic Convention (where I and another reporter had the dubious honor of bailing him out of jail). </p> <p>Unlike some other young revolutionaries of his generation, Hayden didn't turn into a cynic or a conservative when the radical agenda of the 1960s and 70s gave way to the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s. Instead, he participated in progressive politics in Southern California, serving the state assembly and senate for nearly twenty years and working with local grassroots groups. </p> <p>Hayden believes that the 2008 presidential election is far more than just another horse race between two men, or even two parties. </p> <p>\"The movement for Barack Obama is a genuine social movement inside the trappings of a presidential campaign,\" he says. \"I think the Obama movement will produce the next wave of social activism in America for the next 20 or 30 years, whether he wins or loses.\" </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-hayden/an-endorsement-of-the-mov_b_83478.html\">an essay endorsing Obama in the California primary last January</a>, Hayden wrote: \"Today I see across the generational divide the spirit, excitement, energy and creativity of a new generation bidding to displace the old ways. Obama's moment is their moment, and I pray that they succeed without the sufferings and betrayals my generation went through.\" </p> <p>In a sense, Hayden tells us, both Sarah Palin's and Barack Obama's candidacies represent different apocalyptic visions of the future. For Palin and her followers, the rapture will be their reward when Christ returns to earth to gather up the faithful. For Obama's youthful supporters, a grimmer fate awaits them, with no money for college, no decent jobs, no rights, and a world brought to \"the edge of extinction\" by global warming - unless we change course now. </p> <p>Hayden thinks that African Americans never believed whites would vote for a black man - and now that they have, many fear that Obama will be killed. </p> <p>\"We have to elect him and we have to protect him ... I have no doubt there are a lot of people in this country who are planning to shoot him, and there is a climate being generated to whip them up ... But he's got tools as well. He's got protection. He's got grace.\" </p> <p>And Hayden himself is looking toward the day when this historic campaign achieves its goal.</p> <p>\"I'd like to see those Obama girls playing on the White House lawn,\" he says.</p>"
