  "<p><strong>Name your three desert island must-have ingredients</strong></p> <p>I couldn't go anywhere without cheese. If I could only take one with me it would probably be Beenleigh Blue - it's the best sheep's milk cheese in the world. I'd have to have a glass of wine, so I would say an Aloxe-Corton - I'd have a bottle of that. I'm not going to last very long on this desert island, am I? I'd take a pig with me, because I'd feel pretty confident making some ham, and a bit of pancetta and some bacon, so that would keep me going.</p> <p><strong>What would you have for your last supper? </strong></p> <p>I'd probably have an absolutely perfectly fresh <em>mozzarella di buffalo</em>. It would have to be flown in, having been made the day before. I would just have the merest drizzle of olive oil around the edge of the plate. I wouldn't have any tomatoes, I'd just have a big round ball that I would slice up and enjoy. </p> <p>Then I'd have a dish that I found a long time ago in one of Delia Smith's early books, a pheasant pot-roasted in cider with Cox's apples. It's a meal that my wife and I cook every two or three weeks during pheasant season. It's just an incredible meal. I'd have it with the most wonderful new potatoes and runner beans that are coming out of our garden at the moment.</p> <p>I'd finish with a plate of Beenleigh Blue and an absolutely ripe pear.</p> <p><strong>What foodstuff would you put in Room 101? </strong></p> <p>Celery. I love celeriac, but I can't stand celery. It makes me shudder - I hate it. </p> <p>And liver, which is a great shame. It's the result of being fed the most appalling liver at school, immediately after the second world war. As soon as I achieved sufficient independence I said \"Right, no more liver\". My wife tends to order it quite often when we eat out, and I sometimes taste it, but I still don't like it. Yet I love fois gras - but that's very politically incorrect now.</p> <p><strong>What's your favourite table? </strong></p> <p>I really do enjoy the food at Arbutus in Frith Street, because it's a nice twist on a lot of good, traditional English meats that you don't often see. They will sell you a small carafe of any of the wines they have, which means you can grace really good food with a really good wine. These days, I can't manage half a bottle of wine at lunchtime - I'd go to sleep in the afternoon. Here, you can have a glass-and-a-half each of really good wine - you don't have to stomach appalling house wine. If there's one gripe I've got, it's that too many restaurants still have the most appalling house wine.</p> <p><strong>What's your poison? </strong></p> <p>I enjoy wine enormously. My wife and I have a bottle every night of our lives. The only other alcoholic drink that we really indulge in - besides champagne \u2013 is averna, which is an amaro. We particularly like the one from Sicily. We call it Night Nurse, because it's a <em>digestivo</em>, and if you've eaten late, this settles your tummy and you have a really good night's sleep. It's beautiful. You must only have one, though - on holiday I had two and woke up with a rotten head. </p> <p><strong>Which book gets you cooking? </strong></p> <p>Delia Smith. I found myself a bachelor again in 1983, after I'd been horribly spoiled and lost the habit of cooking. I got a Delia book \u2013 she looks extraordinarily young on the front cover \u2013 and it's still on our shelf in the kitchen. She's got some really good traditional recipes, often with her own little twist. It's proper cooking.</p> <p><strong>What's your dream dinner party line-up? </strong></p> <p>I would have enjoyed the company of Noel Coward, because when the conversation lulled he could tell you the most fabulous stories about the people he's mixed with. An astronaut who'd walked on the moon would be brilliant. Sir Winston Churchill would be a fabulous dinner guest, and there'd be none of this modern-day nonsense about abusing alcohol, he'd just be encouraging us to have another glass of wine. I'm tempted to say Margaret Thatcher - I know that I'd end up having a flaming row with her, but it would be extraordinarily interesting. I really would loved to have met Marilyn Monroe. And, of course, my wife and I. </p> <p><strong>What was your childhood teatime treat? </strong></p> <p>Anything fresh from our garden. It set the pattern for my life, because my father always grew vegetables, and I learned from him. His asparagus bed was his pride and joy. If you've ever eaten asparagus a quarter of an hour after it's been cut from the asparagus bed, I tell you what - you lived. Seasonality is again terribly fashionable, but I have never, ever lost it. I have never wanted to have a strawberry out of the season. </p> <p>It's the same for my grandson and granddaughter, who are only six and four. The other day I whacked the fork into the ground and out came these wrinkly pink fir apple potatoes - they laughed like drains. Their sheer joy took me back 55 years. Kids of that age love vegetables as long as they actually taste of something. </p> <p><strong>What would you cook to impress a date? </strong></p> <p>I guess I'd go back to the pheasant, because I feel so confident doing it. I'm pretty damn sure that unless the person was vegetarian, they'd say: \"Wow, that's incredible\". </p> <p><strong>What was your most memorable meal? </strong></p> <p>I used to love Chez Nico at the Dorchester. I probably had my most memorable meal there with Glynn Christian. Nico came out and I said to him: \"That was just the best meal ever\". I can't remember what we had, because we proceeded to have rather too much wine, but I remember thinking how good it was.</p> <p><strong>What was your biggest food disaster? </strong></p> <p>Years ago I was trying to impress somebody, and I paid a lot of money for some very good steaks. I should have let the steaks speak for themselves, but I decided to go all arty-farty and created a sauce. The lady scraped all the sauce off and ate the steak without it - I took one bite and did the same.</p> <p><strong>What's the worst meal you've ever had? </strong></p> <p>A lamb shank in a hotel in Essex about ten years ago. I'd had a god-awful journey driving over there from Dorset. The lamb had clearly been pre-cooked by some wholesaler, and some chap had just rammed it into the microwave. It was just so unbelievably bad. It was the perfect example of what's wrong in the kitchen at so many hotels in this country: it's just recycled rubbish.</p> <p><strong>What's the most outlandish thing you've ever eaten? </strong></p> <p>In Egypt, we had spatch-cocked pigeons, which isn't in itself terribly unusual \u2013 other than the fact that there were no knives and forks. We were expected to pick it up and eat the lot, including the bone. It wasn't a pleasant sensation, crunching through bone. </p> <p><strong>Who's your food hero/food villain? </strong></p> <p>My food hero is currently Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. I think the guy deserves a knighthood for what he's doing. He's almost the only one who has not sold out to the supermarkets one iota. Yes, he wants to pay his mortgage and earn a living, but he's doing it without selling his soul in the way that almost all the others have.</p> <p>My villain is Sir Terry Leahy of Tesco, because he's single-handedly persuaded the British public that food should be cheap, and that we should spend the lowest percentage of our disposable household income of any European nation on food. We value what we put inside our bodies less than our plasma televisions, and it breaks my heart.</p> <p><strong>Nigella or Delia? </strong></p> <p>Delia before her last little thing, her How to Cheat.</p> <p><strong>Vegetarians: genius or madness? </strong></p> <p>Madness.</p> <p><strong>Starter or pudding? </strong></p> <p>Starter. But I love a cheeseboard - if it's not coming straight from the fridge, like most restaurants do.</p> <p><strong>Fusion food or Best of British? </strong></p> <p>That's an interesting one. I think I would go for fusion, only because there are big chunks of our so-called British heritage that I just don't enjoy that much: things like stews, Lancashire hotpots ... They work a lot better with the introduction of a couple of spices, which the traditional recipes wouldn't have.</p> <p><strong>What's the best/worst thing about the British food scene? </strong></p> <p>The worst is the celebrity chef culture, which is based on show business rather than trying to help people understand the basics of good food ingredients. Chefs should do so much more in teaching people how to source - not just saying \"Take a breast of chicken; take a leg of lamb\". They should be telling them that this dish works better if you buy a free-range chicken that's lived for 93 days, all that kind of stuff. </p> <p>The best thing is the vast numbers of the population that have been switched on to local food.</p> <p><strong>What's the next big thing? </strong></p> <p>It's already happening: people want to know provenance. How much it's happening in metropolitan areas I don't know, but around here [Devon] people want to know the farm where the meat comes from, they really do, and that's doing great things for the local farmshops. Thirteen years ago, our local butcher used to go up to Smithfields [market in London] and buy a hell of a lot. You walk in his shop now and he listing every single farm that he buys his pork, lamb and beef from. </p> <p>People are deeply worried about the fact that British farming is being decimated. We've lost half our dairy farmers; we're losing pig farmers by the drove. If that continues, everything will be imported, which, the way global warming is going, is not a very healthy place to be. I honestly think that the next big thing will be people saying: \"Where did that come from? Who made that?\" </p> <p>It will give the anonymity of supermarket own-label a kick up the backside, because they don't tell you anything - you've no idea where that stuff's made. They can cheat to their hearts content - they can even lie by telling you it's produced in Britain when all of the ingredients have come from abroad. If we could force them to name the producer, that would be good news.</p> <p><strong>Make a wish</strong></p> <p>I would love us to someone to wave a magic wand and make us adopt the Mediterranean approach to food, so lunch is resurrected and we don't eat as much in the evenings. The older I get, the more I realise that having the largest meal of the day in the evening is not good for us. In Spain, they'll start work at eight, finish at 3, have a big meal, and then they'll maybe just have a boiled egg or something before they go to bed. People who do that don't have problems with obesity. It'll never happen, but I think we'd all be a lot healthier and not quite as tubby. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><a href=\"http://www.finefoodworld.co.uk\">The Guild of Fine Food</a> organises the annual Great Taste Awards, known as the Oscars of the food industry.

  "<p>Greenpeace climate change activists who scaled one of Britain's tallest power station chimneys, causing \u00a330,000 damage, were accused in court yesterday of crossing the line of acceptable protest. </p> <p>Five activists, with food and water to stay four days, climbed the 200-metre chimney at Kingsnorth coal-fired power station near Hoo, Kent, last October. They had planned to daub \"Gordon, bin it\" on the outside of the chimney, but only got as far as painting the name \"Gordon\" before they came down after 30 hours, a jury at Maidstone crown court heard yesterday.</p> <p>Huw Williams, 41, from Nottingham; Ben Stewart, 34, from Lyminge, Kent; Kevin Drake, 44, from Westbury, Wiltshire; Will Rose, 29, from London; and Emily Hall, 34, from New Zealand are all charged with criminal damage to the chimney. Tim Hewke, 48, from Ulcombe, Kent, who the prosecution says helped organise the protest from the ground, is also charged with criminal damage. None of them deny causing the damage and they also accept the estimated costs of repairing the damage. </p> <p>The legality of causing the damage in the first place would be the central issue of the case, said John Price, prosecuting. \"These defendants maintain that they had a lawful excuse for damaging the chimney for the protection of other property. Other property, you will hear, in Kent and all around the world. Property said to be at the risk of more serious damage threatened by climate change which is caused by the substantial increase in greenhouse gases of which it is said coal-burning power stations make a large contribution.\" </p> <p>But he said the acts committed by the protesters were \"not capable of being lawful\". He told the jury of nine men and three women that the case was not a prosecution of free speech or legitimate political protest but a prosecution for crossing the line of acceptable protest. </p> <p>\"There are things you can lawfully do in making a protest, but there's a line which has to be drawn,\" he said. </p> <p>The activists, who begin their defence today, are expected to argue that they acted to prevent lives being lost and damage being done to properties around the world by global warming. It will be the first time that such a climate change defence has been used in a British court.</p> <p>The environment group is expected to call leading international climate change academics, researchers and environmentalists as witnesses.</p> <p>Greenpeace was in a similar situation in 1999 when Lord Melchett, its director at the time, along with others destroyed a field of GM crops in Norfolk. They said in court they were acting to prevent wider environmental damage. The not guilty verdict sent a message to environmental activists that they would not necessarily be punished under the law if they caused damage to property.</p> <p>The case, which is expected to run a further five days, has extra significance because of public opposition to Kingsnorth power station, and many people have pledged to disobey the law if a coal-fired station is built. More than 2,500 people demonstrated against it last month. </p> <p>Gordon Brown is expected to give approval to Kingsnorth in the next few months, making it the first new coal-fired station for 30 years. The case continues.</p>",
  "<p>Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone company, will launch an all-out assault on Apple's iPhone today with a new range of phones that will give music lovers access to an unlimited service.</p> <p>Anyone willing buy a Nokia Comes With Music pre-pay phone will be able to download up to 2.1m music tracks - about a quarter of the number available from Apple's iTunes - onto their computer for no extra charge for 12 months.</p> <p>Those tracks can be loaded onto the Nokia phone and after a year users will need to buy a new device in order to continue downloading new releases. In contrast to other so-called unlimited music services, however, if they choose not to buy a new device, they can keep all the tracks they have already downloaded. </p> <p>They will still play on the user's computer and handset, which will also still be able to send texts and make calls.</p> <p>Nokia, which is hoping the phone will be popular this Christmas with parents seeking to make their children's music file sharing legal, will today announce that the UK will be the first market to get Comes With Music.</p> <p>The first phone will be its 5310 handset, although at least one more device will be announced in time for Christmas.</p> <p>The company has signed up Carphone Warehouse, which has more than 800 shops, to stock the phone. Carphone Warehouse is also Apple's sole independent stockist of the iPhone.</p> <p>Nokia's UK managing director Simon Ainslie believes the Nokia Comes With Music range will be \"the number one selling product at Christmas\". </p> <p>\"This is a unique proposition. Nobody has launched an unlimited music service that allows you to keep your music with no catches,\" said Ainslie. \"What we are trying to do is bring back some value to the music industry from people who are not paying for music. There are a lot of parents who would like to legitimise their children's purchasing of music.\"</p> <p>Already some internet service providers (ISPs) have sent letters to persistent illegal file sharers warning them that their activities have been noticed, having reached a deal with industry body the BPI. For many parents this will be the first indication that their children are doing anything illicit on the internet.</p> <p>Nokia Comes With Music, which was first mooted last year, is a gamble for the Finnish handset maker, which supplies four out of every 10 phones sold worldwide. It risks further damaging Nokia's already fraught relationship with many of the major mobile phone companies. Last year it provoked their ire by announcing its own suite of mobile services - under the Ovi brand - which operators saw as a direct attempt to undercut their relationship with mobile phone users.</p> <p>In fact, Nokia does not yet have a mobile phone partner for Comes With Music. As a result anyone buying the phone will have to put their existing SIM card into it or sign up for a SIM-only deal such as O2's Simplicity.</p> <p>All five UK networks have held talks with Nokia about Comes With Music but none has found the service attractive - or lucrative - enough to sign up. All the operators have their music download services and see no reason to subsidise a handset that connects users with Nokia's own music store rather than their own. But Nokia still hopes to persuade an operator to subsidise the cost of the phone, which is why it will not set the price of the first handset until next month. It is expected to cost somewhere between \u00a3100 and \u00a3300.</p> <p>Nokia has decided to press on with its unlimited service because of the threat posed to its dominance of the industry by Apple, according to mobile industry insiders. Sales of the iPhone are still small - with analysts forecasting 45m will be sold by next year compared with a global market of about 1bn handsets - it could soon be made available on more networks as the original exclusive network deals it signed in the UK, France, Germany and the US come up for renewal over the next few years.</p> <p>Nokia will pay the music companies a licence fee to make their catalogues available to customers and for the three major labels that have already signed up - SonyBMG, Universal and Warner Music - the service is another attempt to try and claw some revenue back from the illegal file sharers. But Nokia has yet to reach a deal with the UK's host of independent music labels or EMI.</p> <p>\"Comes With Music is a way for Nokia to add extra value to its handsets and generate more stickiness for its brand,\" said Carolina Milanesi, research director at Gartner. But Nokia has tailored the service to the economic downturn in its major European markets.</p> <p>\"The 5310 handset is definitely more aimed at the mid-tier of the market - this is not the high-end device that people were expecting to see for Comes With Music,\" she added. \"They are responding to the trend we are beginning to see in Europe of people switching towards the mid-tier because of the economic climate.\"</p> <h2>Explainer: Music unlimited</h2> <p>Nokia Comes With Music is the latest attempt to make <strong>digital music </strong>pay by bundling the cost together with another service or product - in this case the cost of the handset. There are already numerous subscription-based unlimited music services such as <strong>Napster </strong>and <strong>MusicStation</strong>; even Apple is rumoured to be working on one for <strong>iTunes</strong>. Rather than charging a separate subscription, the Danish internet firm TDC has bundled the cost of unlimited music with its broadband service. <strong>BSkyB </strong>recently signed a deal with Universal that could lead to a similar service in the UK. In France, <strong>Orange </strong>has launched MusiqueMax, which allows users to download up to 500 tracks a month for \u20ac12 and keep them as long as they like. All these services have some sort of <strong>digital rights management </strong>(DRM) software that prevents tracks being played after a subscription expires or means they can only be transferred to certain devices. Nokia Comes With Music uses <strong>Microsoft DRM </strong>technology, so downloaded tracks cannot be played on an iPod. Others in the music industry believe the future of digital music lies in offering DRM-free tracks that can be played on any device. Such tracks are already sold by iTunes, Amazon and handset maker Sony Ericsson in the Nordic region.</p>",
  "<p>The German energy company RWE, owner of npower, said yesterday it was spending \u00a36m on a minority stake in the British wind turbine maker Quiet Revolution.</p> <p>Quiet Revolution specialises in small-scale, vertical-axis turbines that are more suitable for use in built-up areas than more conventional turbines. The company's flagship product, the QR5, can produce up to six kilowatts of power. The triple-helix-shaped wind turbines are five metres high and just over three metres wide.</p> <p>\"The local supply of electric power to individual buildings from renewable energy will become increasingly significant,\" said Fritz Vahrenholt, the head of the RWE subsidiary RWE Innogy. \"Small windpower units on roofs can make a major contribution to this goal - especially in places with insufficient sunshine, so that photovoltaics would not be efficient enough.\"</p> <p>RWE said it wanted to help take the QR5 to mass production so that it would become commercially viable. About 30 of the turbines have been produced and installed around Britain, and a further 45 have been sold and are at the manufacturing or installation stages.</p> <p>Robert Webb, the chief executive of Quiet Revolution, said: \"We are delighted to be working with RWE Innogy to deliver efficient local wind energy. </p> <p>\"This investment will allow us to rapidly expand our production capacity to meet demand, and develop a range of new products to satisfy needs in a global marketplace.\"</p> <p>Micro wind turbines have had a chequered record in Britain, because many have failed to live up to their manufacturers' promises in terms of the power they have delivered. </p> <p>Small ones tend to work badly in built-up areas because buildings break up wind flows - but this is the problem that Quiet Revolution says it has solved with its new designs.</p>",
  "<h2>Stay at home</h2> <p>Estelle Morris's article on going away to university (Everyone needs the chance to leave home to study, August 26) is symptomatic of this country's myopic view of higher education. It's myopic in the assumption that the British way is the norm. In fact, around the world, it is the norm to study at your home university. And it's myopic in its ignorance of the effects on: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> the environment: does it really make sense to have hundreds of thousands of students traversing the country six times a year? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> housing: the majority of those going away are privately housed, so what should be first homes for families are turned into second homes for students; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> cohesion: the impact of student colonies is devastating for communities in the shadow of the ivory tower; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> access: what does more to perpetuate HE as a middle-class enclave than the boarding-school model of attendance? </p> <p>Access to HE will be equitable only when \"going away\" is ditched. <br><strong>Dr Richard Tyler</strong>, Houses in Multiple Occupation lobby, Leeds. <br><a href=\"http://hmolobby.org.uk/index.htm\">http://hmolobby.org.uk/index.htm</a></p> <h2>All you need is love</h2> <p>I do not know if inequality is worse than ever elsewhere with respect to GCSE results (Is inequality worse than ever? August 26).

In addition, the best improvements have generally been seen in those schools in the poorest parts of the city, where - surprise, surprise - the local authority focused more of its support. <br><strong>Cllr Paul Clein</strong>, cabinet member for education, Liverpool City Council </p> <p>While Michael Gove and Ruth Lupton may disagree over details, the realities of social inequality remain. Successive governments have failed to stem a \"Matthew principle\" whereby the rich get richer and the poor don't. </p> <p>The marketisation of education fits within this dominant paradigm.

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday September 3 2008 </strong></p> <p> In the article below, a rating outlook for the Nationwide Building Society that we attributed to Fitch was in fact carried out by Moody's.</p> <p> </p> <p>Bradford &amp; Bingley is parting company with its first board member since the arrival of new chief executive Richard Pym two weeks ago.</p> <p>Sales director Mark Stevens quit yesterday after five years on the day the troubled buy-to-let specialist suffered a fresh blow from the credit-rating agencies.</p> <p>Despite the recent \u00a3400m rights issue, Fitch cut its rating because of the bank's plunge into the red in the first six months of the year.</p> <p>Fitch said: \"The weaker revenues driven by narrowing interest spreads and a shrinking loan book coincided with worsening bad debts\".</p> <p>B&amp;B reported losses of \u00a326.7m in the six months to the end of June last week, and admitted that mortgage arrears were rising and that savers had withdrawn deposits amid its fundraising. Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas yesterday described the rise in arrears as \"alarming\".</p> <p>Fitch also admitted it was concerned about its rating of Nationwide. Though the rating of the country's biggest building society was not downgraded, Fitch gave it a \"negative outlook\" because of its challenges in the deteriorating economic environment in the UK. Nationwide's acquisition of Portman Building Society increased its exposure to buy-to-let and self-certification mortgages, Fitch noted, which could prove more problematic than its traditional customer base.</p> <p>However, the agency noted that Nationwide's loan book has been performing above the average and that it would withstand the downturn better than its rivals.</p> <p>On B&amp;B, Fitch said the outlook was negative as it downgraded the long-term issue default rating to BBB+. However, the agency welcomed the completion of the rights issue - which has left six high street banks with stakes in the lender - and the arrival of Pym as chief executive.</p> <p>Pym said he wanted Stevens, who joined from Apax partners in 2003 and earned \u00a3350,000 last year, to remain. \"I had wanted Mark to stay but he has made a personal decision to leave us,\" Pym said.</p> <p>B&amp;B's shares remained below the 55p at which the rights issue was priced to close 2.25p lower at 46.75p.</p> <p>B&amp;B admitted last week it was being hit by fraud that had come to light as house prices fell. </p> <p>It stressed its experiences were in line with the wider industry, which yesterday, through the Council of Mortgage Lenders, introduced new measures to improve conveyancing and valuation processes of newly built properties.</p>",
  "<p>Last year's Venice film festival hit new highs, with a superb programme that ranged from Michael Clayton and The Assassination of Jesse James to Lust, Caution and Couscous. Perhaps it's inevitable, then, that there is a real down feeling here this year. There are also suggestions that Venice is taking a hammering from Toronto, which starts just as Venice is winding up, and provides a soft landing for films looking to enter the US market.</p> <p>But actually, it's more likely that we are at a quietish moment in cinema's evolution. Apart from the Coen brothers, whose Burn After Reading opened the festival with a suitably hysterical dose of red-carpet razzle-dazzle (courtesy of Brad Pitt and George Clooney), the films have been solid rather than spectacular. Though many of the higher-brow critics were sniffy about Burn, it is a cracking comedy, its laughs laced with that creeping sense of menace the Coens do so well. It is also self-consciously throwaway, but that only adds to the fun.</p> <p>It is certainly a lot less portentous and self-important than Guillermo Arriaga's directorial debut, The Burning Plain, which was the only other film to get the paparazzi hot under the collar. Although The Burning Plain retains Arriaga's trademark time-shift jigsaw puzzle of a narrative, his directorial manner can best be described as plodding. </p> <p>Behind this surface flash, the rest of the Venice programme seemed like plain porridge without sugar, comprising the sort of names that make a splash at festivals without necessarily troubling the outside world too much. I made a mistake in opting to see the new Abbas Kiarostami film, Shirin, rather than the new Takeshi Kitano, Achilles and the Tortoise, but I still can't work out whether Shirin was fascinating or awful. Maybe it was fascinatingly awful?</p> <p>Shirin is comprised entirely of individual head-and-shoulder shots of Iranian women in a cinema audience. We only hear the film they are watching, an adaptation of the classical Persian fable Khosrow and Shirin. The reactions of the women are, of course, the main focus, and the unseen film itself remains of considerable interest, but Kiarostami has pushed audiences a little too far. He no longer appears all that interested in cinema, seemingly reinventing himself as an installation-type-artist-cum-film-maker. In contrast, Hayao Miyazaki's new anime, Ponyo On the Cliff By the Sea, proved a kiddie-friendly crowd-pleaser. While it is no Spirited Away, this adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid was easy on the eye and fun to watch - and it is a vast improvement on his last film that was released in the UK, the lumbering Howl's Moving Castle.</p> <p>There was very little British interest - most of the Film Council's efforts seem to be directed at getting movies into Toronto. Apart from the Coen film, which was produced by Working Title, the only other Brit iron in the fire was Vinyan, part-financed by Film Four. Vinyan is directed by Fabrice du Welz, who made such a splash with Calvaire, his Deliverance-style ordeal movie set in Belgium. But it's a real mess. Using Apocalypse Now as its model, it has a European couple (Emmanuelle B\u00e9art and Rufus Sewell) going up-river into Burma in search of their lost son, previously thought drowned in the tsunami. While Du Welz shows a precocious visual sense, and makes decent use of his jungle locations, very little feeling of menace is generated, and the script's machinations seem absurd rather than nightmarish. </p> <p>The new film from Turkish-Italian director Ferzan Ozpetek is a gruesome story of domestic abuse and killing called, with readily apparent irony, A Perfect Day, in which a cop terrorises his ex-wife then kidnaps their two children. No prizes for guessing it all ends badly. I found it gripping, but I suspect it will show only at festivals in the UK, if at all.</p> <p>But it was another homegrown talent, one from a considerably more successful generation, that provided my most enjoyable experience. Venice still dines out on the great postwar clutch of gifted Italian film-makers - Rossellini, Fellini, Visconti - and arguably the most extraordinary was accorded a special screening of a documentary made in 1962. </p> <p>Pier Paolo Pasolini was murdered in 1975, but he left behind a remarkable body of work, now under the curatorship of Giuseppe Bertolucci, the brother of another Italian film-making legend. La Rabbia (The Anger) was a film essay commissioned by the owner of a newsreel company, who provided his archive for Pasolini to edit. But after getting cold feet, the producer removed a large chunk of Pasolini's film and replaced it with one by a popular rightwing journalist. Pasolini, a committed Marxist, eventually acquiesced, but Bertolucci has returned to Pasolini's original notes and created a reconstruction of what the master had planned.</p> <p>La Rabbia is a fascinating film, in which Pasolini correctly identified decolonised nations as the new source of global power. Pasolini appears to have become a secular saint, with Bertolucci's film receiving a rapturous reception. Some things end happily after all.</p>",
  "<p>Hurricanes draw their power from the warm waters of the tropics, and although they can reach category five at sea, with winds exceeding 155mph, it is rare for them to hit land with such destructive force. Last year, Hurricane Dean became only the fourth category five storm to reach land. Gustav has been downgraded twice from category four in recent days, once after it passed Cuba, and yesterday as it approached Louisiana. Winds from the category two storm are still expected to reach 110mph.</p> <p>Sea surface temperatures have to be at least 26.5C for a hurricane to form. If the winds are calm, the heat can build up to form an intense low pressure weather system, which causes winds to spiral round and suck up water vapour. As the warm vapour rises in the core of the hurricane, it cools and condenses to form rain, dumping energy into the storm and helping it to grow. The most ferocious winds are whipped up in the hurricane's \"eyewall\", off to the side of the eye, which itself can be completely calm.</p> <p>Hurricanes typically lose power as they make landfall because their fuel supply is cut off. Even if the land surface is warm, they are unable to draw enough water vapour up to sustain their power.</p> <p>Some scientists believe global warming is making hurricanes more intense by heating up the world's oceans, although others believe it is hard to rule out natural variation in hurricane cycles.</p>",
  "<p>Sterling tumbled to a record low against the euro yesterday and to its weakest level against the dollar for over two years after Alistair Darling's weekend comments about the economy facing its biggest challenge for 60 years.</p> <p>Although Treasury officials stressed that the chancellor was talking about the credit crunch and high oil and food prices facing the world economy more generally, traders sold the pound heavily, pushing it to less than $1.80 at one point and to 81.4p to the euro.</p> <p>A month ago the pound would buy $2 and a euro could be bought for 78p. Bank of England data show that sterling has fallen almost 5% in the past month against a basket of major currencies, pummelled by a string of weak economic data, suggesting growth had ground to a halt in the second quarter of the year. The pound fell 8.6% against the dollar in August, its worst monthly performance since October 1992, when it came out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.</p> <p>Figures yesterday from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply showed that the manufacturing sector had suffered its fourth monthly output decline in August. Along with further weakness in mortgage approvals, the data seemed to back up what Darling had been talking about and reinforced the selling of sterling. \"Investors saw it as an easy opportunity to have a go at a wounded animal,\" said Maurice Pomery, senior strategist at IDEAglobal.</p> <p>Royal Bank of Scotland analyst Paul Robson said: \"The data shows no sign of improving and while that continues people will bring forward the possible timing of the first Bank of England rate cut.\"</p> <p>The Bank of England has left interest rates steady at 5% despite the deteriorating economic outlook because it is concerned about rising inflation, which is at 4.4%, the highest for 16 years and more than double the Bank's government-set target of 2%.</p> <p>The fall in the value of the pound, stressed Stephen Lewis, economist at Insinger de Beaufort, should be good news for the ailing British economy.</p> <p>\"Sterling's slide will boost UK import costs but should improve UK exporters' international competitiveness,\" he said. \"It is a development that should help the re-balancing of the UK economy towards exports, provided the Bank of England and the Treasury keep tight control over domestic demand.\"</p> <p>Oil prices also fell sharply yesterday, dropping more than $4 a barrel to a four-month low of $110.60 for US light crude futures after it became apparent that the Gulf storm would cause less damage than expected. Fears that the credit crisis is damaging growth across the world and thereby hampering global demand for crude are also holding back oil prices.</p> <p>\"Worries about an economic slowdown spreading to the eurozone and worries that oil demand growth in emerging markets may slow later this year are creating the bearish sentiment in the oil market,\" Singapore-based energy analyst Victor Shum said.</p> <p>Falling oil prices also weighed on leading shares, dragging the FTSE 100 down 34 points, or 0.6%, to close at 5,602.8. Cairn Energy, Tullow Oil, BG Group and Royal Dutch Shell all shed between 2% and 5.6%. Mining stocks such as Anglo American and BHP Billiton fell between 4% and 6%.</p>",
  "<p>Vivendi cheered investors yesterday with a rise in second-quarter profits thanks to strong growth at its videogame and pay-TV businesses, and news that it will not be launching a refinancing to fund a recent spate of deals.</p> <p>But Universal Music, the world's largest music company and part of the Paris-based Vivendi empire, saw revenues decline 5.3% and profits drop 9.2% in the three months to the end of June, as CD sales continued to slide and revenues from digital downloads failed to plug the gap.</p> <p>Chairman Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy said that despite \"a tighter economic environment\" the company would stick to its forecast of profit growth similar to last year.</p> <p>The company had shown \"very good resistance to this slightly tense economic situation\", he said, although analysts admitted they still had reservations about the potential impact of a prolonged period of economic downturn on the company.</p> <p>Vivendi has been beefing itself up through acquisitions this year. In April it spent \u20ac4.5bn (\u00a33.6bn) buying out Neuf Cegetel, the French fixed-line telecoms company, so it could add residential broadband services to the portfolio of products offered by its SFR mobile phone unit.</p> <p>Vodafone has a 44% stake in SFR and has long wanted full control, as France is the only major western economy in which it does not own a mobile phone business. Vivendi, however, also wants control of the business.</p> <p>In July Vivendi merged its computer games business, the creator of the world's most popular online role-playing game World of Warcraft, with its US rival Activision, owner of the popular Guitar Hero franchise, to create Activision Blizzard.</p> <p>Vivendi had suggested it would finance these two deals through a rights issue of as much as \u20ac2bn. But yesterday Levy said: \"We are today in a position to affirm that we won't need to call on the market to finance these acquisitions.\" </p> <p>The company is not, however, looking for any more acquisitions.</p> <p>The Cegetel and Activision deals helped boost Vivendi's second-quarter results. SFR saw sales increase by a third to just under \u20ac3bn, but profits before financial charges were roughly flat at \u20ac716m as a result of the cost of integrating the Neuf Cegetel business. Vivendi's computer games business saw revenues rise 6.7% to \u20ac223m with profits of \u20ac42m. Its French pay-TV business Canal Plus increased revenues by almost 5% to just over \u20ac1.1bn, with profits up 31% at \u20ac181m. Last year it snapped up Television Par Satellite. </p> <p>But Universal Music, which recently signed a deal with the Rolling Stones, snatching the band from EMI, saw revenues ease 5.3% to just over \u20ac1bn and profits drop 9.2% to \u20ac148m.</p> <p>Overall Vivendi yesterday reported a 15.1% increase in revenues to just under \u20ac6bn for the three months to the end of June, and a 3.2% increase in profits to \u20ac1.36bn.</p>",
  "<p>Can money buy equality? For the thousands of sixth-formers hoping to make their way from state school to the universities of Oxford or Cambridge next year, the question is far from rhetorical. As they rush to tackle Ucas forms that have to be completed by October 15 (well before those of non-Oxbridge candidates), quite a few must wonder how good their chances of success really are. </p> <p>There have certainly been unprecedented efforts to make them apply. Oxford and Cambridge last year alone were involved in hundreds of different initiatives under headings such as widening participation, outreach or access. In addition, individual colleges often run separate schemes with the help of paid staff and student volunteers. Downing College, Cambridge, has a full-time school liaison officer targeting the south-west, as well as its own open days, summer school, school visits and prospectus. </p> <p>The cost is substantial. Downing, a small college with 400 undergraduates, spent \u00a330,000 in the academic year 2007-08 on widening participation, while Cambridge spent \u00a33m and Oxford around \u00a31.8m. </p> <p>However, while such spending is now firmly part of university budgets, the outcome has been disappointing. At Oxbridge only 10% of students, the lowest figure in the UK, still come from the lowest income groups and the general proportion of state school students (who make up over 90% of the school population) has actually slipped: it was 53.7% at Oxford in 2007, but now stands at 53%. At Cambridge it is 57.7%, slightly down from 57.9%. One in three privately educated applicants gets in compared to one in four state-school students. </p> <h2>Lack of key subjects</h2> <p>Geoff Parks, director of undergraduate admissions at Cambridge, explains these outcomes by saying that applicants often did not take key subjects such as maths, chemistry, physics and languages, needed for many Cambridge (and Oxford) courses. The introduction of tuition fees also caused more students to pick a university near home. Oxbridge widening participation schemes are said to have raised young people's aspirations in general, as well as increasing student diversity at Cambridge. While in 1989 barely 5% of UK undergraduates at Cambridge were from ethnic minorities, that figure is now over 14% - though this may include many privately educated Asian students.</p> <p>What this is likely to mean is that over 3,000 state-school students can still expect to enter Oxbridge next year. However, the two universities' admission procedures have also been tweaked in order to raise this figure. One recent change is the abolition of the special Oxford or Cambridge application form, which should make applying less scary. </p> <p>Bridging workshops, too, are now in place so that students can catch up, especially in maths. In addition, Oxford plans to identify disadvantaged applicants by the postcode of their neighbourhood and guarantee them an interview at least. </p> <p>Since the interview is often the main stumbling block, Oxbridge interviewers also receive increasingly detailed guidance. While it was once acceptable for dons to provoke a student in order to extract an original reply, they must now adopt a friendly style. </p> <p>As a mentor working with a number of state schools, I believe this is an important change, but also one that may still need to bed in. Last December, one applicant I know found the formal interview deeply unsettling and was rejected by the college. What rescued the student was a further change in the admissions process: Oxford candidates are now normally seen by two colleges. At the second one, more skilled interviewers managed to connect and the timid youngster did well enough to be offered a place. </p> <p>The use of academic interview language, which many students can only hope to acquire at university, is another ongoing concern. Written tests, almost unknown a decade ago, are being used more, partly to counter this point. Initially welcomed by comprehensive school teachers, some have now been panned for over-complex wording, too many Latinate terms and a lack of clarity about their precise weight. A test result of well above 90%, it seems, cannot always compensate for a nervous student's poor interview performance. </p> <p>Prospectuses, arguably, have improved most, and the 2008 ones at last offer the kind of details that help to balance the scale between privileged and disadvantaged groups. This is not to say they are perfect or free of misinformation: both universities badly understate the amount of focused preparation students from ordinary schools may need in order to impress. </p> <p>The Oxford prospectus also advises students \"not to worry too much about choosing a college\", as this is mainly about \"your living environment\". To the uninitiated, this could suggest that the size of the snooker table in the common room is all you should care about. In fact, interviews at top-ranked colleges tend to be very much harder. </p> <h2>Phantom applicants</h2> <p>Since Oxbridge dons are expected to provide tuition, lecture, run seminars, research and, somehow, also publish academic papers to world-class standards, many admit they dread any further addition to their workload. Due to what academics everywhere describe as a yawning gap between secondary and higher education, too many students already arrive lacking essay skills, numeracy or practice in theoretical thinking. While most do catch up, some interviewers must be tempted to look for phantom applicants, disadvantaged yet well informed, educated at ordinary schools yet exceptionally articulate and equipped with just the right qualifications. </p> <p>This can greatly advantage some state schools over others, as shown by a 2008 case study called \"Primed for Success\", by the Institute of Education. Its researchers found that the state school that gained the highest proportion of Oxbridge places in their sample was not the one whose students had the highest grades. Instead, it had the most highly educated parents. Many retained personal links to Oxbridge and could offer academic help, subject talks and mock interviews. Teachers would draw on this, in addition to sending students on widening participation schemes. </p> <p>Given this imperfect state of affairs, you might expect institutional intervention. In fact, the Office of Fair Access (Offa) merely encourages Oxbridge \"to seek to increase the proportion of suitably qualified students from under-represented groups\", without a precise target. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), which has allocated Oxford and Cambridge just over \u00a3200,000 of Access cash each for 2008-09, says this is not directly linked to the number of students from state schools. </p> <p>More changes in the admissions process are likely to come, if only due to growing pressure from parents, teachers and politicians. Among the options already discussed is an expansion of bridging workshops. More four-year (rather than three-year) degree courses in subjects for which state-school students are under-prepared might also be introduced. Written tests may be refined so they cannot be affected by cramming but will identify students capable of catching up fast. </p> <h2>Lottery for places</h2> <p>A more general (and far cheaper) solution was put to me, off the record, by one of the few comprehensive-educated admissions tutors at Oxbridge. What might work best, he believes, is for each college to pick the most outstanding students among its candidates, then conduct a lottery for places among the next-best group. This would, he feels, give especially bright working-class students a better chance than they stand now. </p> <p>However, with none of these changes about to happen quite yet, this year's state-school candidates just have to work on meeting their chosen university's expectations. Since there is no proof that a student's academic ability equals parental ability to pay school fees, both Oxford and Cambridge will undoubtedly want a fair proportion of them to succeed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Elfi Pallis is the author of Oxbridge Entrance, the Real Rules (Tell Books)</p>",
  "<p>Falling mining and energy stocks weighed down the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> yesterday on a day of light trading, with Wall Street closed for business on Labor Day.</p> <p>The blue-chip index lost 33.8 points to close at 5602.8, ending a three-day winning streak. The list of fallers was dominated by mining and energy stocks, which were pulled down by the declining cost of commodities. Specifically, the downgrading of Hurricane Gustav to category two helped to weaken the oil price.</p> <p>Mining group <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> saw shares fall 219p to \u00a350.10 as the president of Chinese aluminium maker Chinalco said it could increase its stake in the company, given the right market conditions.

  "<h2>Thomas MacKay <br>Aged 15, from Bristol </h2> <p>It's got loads of after-school clubs - sports, knitting, cookery classes. In the morning there's a breakfast club. I don't do any of them because I have a different after-school club that isn't at school: it's a youth club, on a Thursday. It's mostly outside activities, so we'll play around, and we do stuff like fire-making and cooking. I love going, it's one of my favourite things to do in the week and Thursday is a day I look forward to. I don't think I would like to be in school from 8am to 6pm - I'd prefer maybe a few days a week with normal hours so I can go to after-school youth clubs and stuff. The idea is all right so long as it's not compulsory or every day. </p> <h2>Chris Gillard <br>Parent, Humberside</h2> <p>We're just going down the road of setting up an after-school club. If you are a working parent, it's about knowing that your children are in a safe environment and are being looked after. Where we live there's plenty to do from, say, 3.30pm to 4.30pm, from chess to cheerleading, but there isn't so much in the way of after-school care up to 6pm, which is what parents need. Sometimes there's stuff for younger children, but not so much for older ones. We're looking for start-up funding, and we will be the hub for all our partner primaries. After-school clubs can come and go and the most important thing is to do what the children actually want. Some kids like to chill out, listen to music; others want to do more. We already do archery, gymnastics and music in our youth club.</p> <h2>Ralph Surman <br>Teacher, Nottingham </h2> <p>Extended care is different from after-school clubs. Where children are staying for a music club, an art club, the enrichment of the curriculum, that is very valuable indeed. Poor examples are where after-school clubs are used as dumping grounds, as a childcare substitute. I think the difference has been blurred by the government. We have polled parents and there's very little demand for childcare, as there is adequate childcare around us and offering it would put us into competition with private providers. Opening the school doors for free until 6pm would put them out of business. I'm not against extending the school day: it's about schools making decisions that are right for their communities. It could work if there was a childcare gap and a private provider was brought into a school to use the premises.</p>",
  "<p>Bad news for those desperate for the day that Richard Branson's flowing locks disappear into the sunset on his Caribbean island of Necker: there is more than one heir to that hair.</p> <p>The multibillionaire's two children have been gossip-column fodder ever since they began flirting with celebrities and royals at polo contests. Now his youngest, Sam, has sacrificed his hectic portfolio career as a part-time model and student of music and cooking to start the serious business of emulating his father's publicity-seeking style.</p> <p>\"I've felt a fraud because I haven't done anything,\" said Sam, 23, recently. So he is currently on a kayaking trip to the North Pole to warn us all of global warming shortly after another three-month jaunt to the Arctic and last year's publication - by Virgin Books - of a diary about his journey.</p> <p>When he's finished saving the world, Sam intends to join his father's Virgin empire and, presumably, keep his planes trailing that nice, warming CO2 through the sky. \"He'd like me to fill his shoes one day,\" he said.</p> <p>Sam is often called the Branson heir but his older sister, Holly, 26, also has the Branson hair and grin.

  "<p>Never fans of understatement, the presenters of Top Gear yesterday charged across London's Tower Bridge in a stretched version of an armoured personnel carrier to launch a \u00a320m world tour that will act as a template for other BBC \"superbrands\" to be taken on the road. </p> <p>After recently agreeing pay deals tying them to the programme for years to come, Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May will present their live show in London and Birmingham from October before taking it around the world. </p> <p>But the announcement comes at a sensitive time for the BBC's commercial arm, with its increasingly vociferous band of critics bound to say their choice of PR stunt is all too appropriate as they complain of the corporation's determination to park its tanks on their lawn.</p> <p>Domestic fans will pay up to \u00a3105 to see the 75-minute live show, where the presenters will play host to up to 16 \"segments\" including a live Top Gear lap challenge - where a member of the audience will race around a purpose-built track - and lead the debate over which cars should make it on to Clarkson's \"cool wall\". </p> <p>Top Gear is the first of up to 20 global \"superbrands\" that BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm, has targeted as potential revenue-generating machines across television, the internet, publishing and live events. </p> <p>The live show will visit 10 cities in its first year, including Johannesburg, Sydney, Auckland and Hong Kong. Each location will host at least 10 shows, with Top Gear Live playing to a total of more than 300,000 people. Deals for a second series of dates, including appearances in Moscow, Stuttgart and Abu Dhabi, are on the verge of being signed. </p> <p>Clarkson said the idea for a live tour was born last year when the presenters were performing in South Africa. \"There was a huge demand from all over the world for us to go and perform. This is an opportunity to come and watch us three cocking about,\" he said. </p> <p>Hammond said he wanted to \"push the boundaries of cocking about in the show\". He added: \"I've had a brilliant idea. It must be possible for us to build a hovercraft. We will also be playing football on the grandest scale, with cars.\"</p> <p>The motoring programme already has a substantial global fanbase after being sold to more than 100 countries. The brand has also been applied to everything from magazines to children's books and toys, and CDs to video games. Now there are plans to turbocharge its growth, establishing a global online presence with the relaunch of its web portal next month and doing deals to make localised versions around the world. </p> <p>But BBC Worldwide has increasingly come under fire from rivals as it has been reorganised to achieve ambitious targets and started acquiring stakes in independent production companies around the world. </p> <p>Tony Elliott, founder of the listings magazine Time Out, has reported it to the Office of Fair Trading over its \u00a375m acquisition of a majority stake in the guide book publisher Lonely Planet, and Alex Graham, chief executive of Wall to Wall Media, producer of Who Do You Think You Are?, accused it of practising a \"cultural version of sub-prime lending\".</p> <p>BBC Worldwide this year unveiled record profits of \u00a3117.7m and its chief executive, John Smith, has embarked on an ambitious expansion plan. But executives argue that it has been charged by the government with exploiting the BBC's assets abroad in order to return profits to the public service arm and that its contribution will become ever more important as the licence fee comes under pressure.</p> <p>Adam Waddell, managing director of Top Gear for BBC Worldwide, said the priority was to maintain its integrity and it had turned down many approaches that he felt would have compromised the brand.</p> <p>He insisted there was no conflict between the BBC2 show, funded by the licence fee, and the commercial exploitation of the brand overseas. He said the global tour would take place during a gap in filming and confirmed that the three presenters had a financial stake in its success.</p>",
  "<p>Children are more likely to experience psychiatric difficulties during their school years if they are underweight at birth, scientists have found.</p> <p>Psychiatrists assessed more than 800 children at regular intervals until the age of 17 and found that those with a birth weight of less than 2.5kg (5lbs 8oz) were more susceptible to anxiety, depression and being withdrawn at school, and likely to have a history of aggressive outbursts.</p> <p>Children who were underweight babies also appeared to have worse attention spans, but only if there were born in an inner city environment, the study found.</p> <p>The findings, published in the US journal Archives of General Psychiatry yesterday, build on previous studies linking low birth weight to medical problems including a greater risk of adult diabetes.</p> <p>The UK has the highest incidence of low birth weight babies in northern Europe. According to a report last year from the Fabian Society, a left-leaning thinktank, 78 of every 1,000 babies born in the UK in 2006 were underweight compared with 67 out of every 1,000 babies in 1989. </p> <p>Naomi Breslau, who led the study at Michigan State University, said underweight children should be given extra help to minimise the impact psychiatric problems could have on their education.</p> <p>The researchers assessed 413 children from a deprived area of inner city Detroit and a further 410 middle class children from a suburb of the city at the ages of six, 11 and 17. Among the oldest inner-city children, 24% of those who were underweight babies scored highly on aggressive behaviour compared with 15% of normal-weight babies. Of the older suburban children, 12.7% scored highly on aggression, compared with 9.4% of normal weight babies. </p> <p>The scientists said the greatest concern was the effect of low birth weight on the attention spans of children born in urban centres. These children were three times more likely to have attention problems at school than children who were born in the suburbs. </p> <p>In a separate study in the same journal, researchers from Sweden reported that children born to older fathers were more at risk of developing bipolar disorder, or manic depression. Researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm said the effect appeared when fathers were older than 29, and increased with age. Children fathered by men aged 55 and older were 1.37 times as likely to be diagnosed with manic depressive disorder as those whose fathers were aged 20 to 24.</p>",
  "<p>Frank Lampard has appealed to England's supporters for patience and vocal backing when they play Andorra on Saturday. The trip to Barcelona for the opening World Cup qualifier, the first competitive tie of Fabio Capello's England's reign, will stir uncomfortable memories, not least for Lampard. </p> <p>The Chelsea midfielder did not play on the last occasion that England took on Andorra at the Olympic Stadium, during the qualifying campaign for Euro 2008, a wrist injury ruling him out. But he witnessed the vein-bulging fury that gripped sections of the travelling support as England, hard on the heels of the 0-0 away draw with Israel, laboured to half-time against their unheralded rivals with the scoreline blank.</p> <p>Steve McClaren, the then manager, heard sustained calls for his dismissal and Lampard, who has suffered at the hands of England's more acerbic followers since the World Cup finals in Germany, was also targeted in the stands. Steven Gerrard, the midfielder, called it \"one of the most difficult 45 minutes for England\" and although they ran out 3-0 winners, Gerrard scoring the first two goals, McClaren cut short his post-match press conference, telling reporters that they could write what they liked. </p> <p>\"It wasn't a good atmosphere, it's as simple as that. Anyone who was there will know that,\" said Lampard. \"We just hope the fans who travel there this time will be behind the team. Games like that can be frustrating because Andorra are just going to sit in and try to make the score as respectable as they can. </p> <p>\"You need the crowd with you because when you're trying to break a team down, sometimes you have to wait a bit longer than you expect. It was a difficult atmosphere. I don't know if it was as bad as I can remember but when you play for England, you have to be tough and be able to handle atmospheres like that and critics.\"</p> <p>Despite his best efforts, Lampard has suffered more than most in the claustrophobic environment of England games. He received a mixed reception from the Wembley crowd when his name was announced before the 2-2 friendly draw with the Czech Republic two weeks ago and he was roundly booed when he was substituted late on. He is sure, though, to be a pivotal figure against Andorra and then Croatia in Zagreb tomorrow week, particularly as Gerrard will miss both qualifying fixtures after undergoing groin surgery. </p> <p>\"I don't know if there will be more onus on me,\" Lampard said. \"The eyes are on all the team because we need to get results. It's not about individuals, the manager is very strong on that, it's about a team effort. We shouldn't single out any players. We have a big enough squad so that if anyone drops out, we should be able to cope. Let's hope we can. </p> <p>\"We are looking to prepare right for both games, we take them as a package and we want six points. We're expected to get three points against Andorra and quite rightly so but those games aren't that easy. Hopefully, we can score an early goal and then go on and get the comfortable result we want. But going into the 10 days, the onus is on trying to get six points.\" </p> <p>Croatia proved England's nemesis in Euro 2008 qualification, beating McClaren's team at home and away, with their 3-2 triumph at Wembley ending the nation's hopes in the final match. Luka Modric, who has since left Dinamo Zagreb for Tottenham Hotspur, was at the heart of Croatia's intelligent counter-attacking game and Lampard has warned of the need to monitor his threat. </p> <p>Lampard faced Modric at Stamford Bridge on Sunday and Tottenham's equaliser in the 1-1 draw came when he challenged him 35 yards from goal and watched the ball squirt off Modric to run through for Darren Bent. </p> <p>\"Modric tried to nutmeg me,\" said Lampard. \"I saw it coming but the ball deflected [into Bent's path], there's nothing you can do. I'm sure Modric will be a good signing for Tottenham. He's a very technical player and certainly one we will have to watch in Croatia.\"</p> <h2>When Harry met Fabio</h2> <p>The Portsmouth manager, Harry Redknapp, has backed Fabio Capello to lead England to the World Cup finals. Redknapp criticised England's tactics after their draw with the Czech Republic two weeks ago, which prompted Capello to seek out Redknapp after last Monday's defeat by Manchester United. \"Me and Fabio had a chat,\" said Redknapp. \"He just said if you can play [Sylvain] Distin at left-back I can play [Steven] Gerrard left wing. I said 'You're not wrong'. Things get blown up - I've met him on a few occasions and if he can't bring success to the team then I don't think anybody can.\"</p>",
  "<p><br>Manchester City have lived in the shadow of their bigger and wealthier neighbours for longer than they will care to remember, but that all changed yesterday with the arrival of the United Arab Emirates royal family and a multi-billionaire described as the Donald Trump of Abu Dhabi. </p> <p>This morning City find themselves not only the richest club in Manchester but perhaps the world. The announcement yesterday that Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister of Thailand, had sold the club to Abu Dhabi United Group (Adug) is expected to be followed by the biggest injection of cash into a football club since Roman Abramovich changed the face of the English game with his \u00a3600m-plus investment in Chelsea. </p> <p>Abramovich's wealth saw Chelsea overtake Manchester United and Real Madrid on the global rich list. Now City, a club that has been synonymous with glorious failure, can claim the title as their own, boasting the kind of wealth that led one source to say of the deal: \"Imagine Chelsea, then times it by at least 10.\" </p> <p>The club wasted little time in flexing their financial muscle yesterday, tabling almost \u00a3100m in bids for new players and clinching Real Madrid's Brazilian forward Robinho for a British record \u00a332.5m when he had seemed destined for Chelsea.</p> <p>Adug is fronted by Sulaiman al-Fahim, a 31-year-old businessman, property mogul and reality-television show host who is ranked 16th in Arabian Business Magazine's list of 100 most powerful Arabs, with a personal wealth said to be 10 times that of Abramovich. </p> <p>Last night he insisted he had not put up the money himself but was a figurehead for members of the UAE's royal family, whose riches are even greater, and that the aim was to establish City among the world's elite clubs. </p> <p>\"Our goal is very simple - to make Manchester City the biggest club in the Premier League,\" said Fahim.</p> <p>Fahim is chief executive of Hydra Properties, a company set up only two years ago but which has already signed more than \u00a31bn worth of contracts in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Mexico and around the world. Fahim, a flamboyant character, is regularly seen in Hollywood and was recently pictured with Leonardo di Caprio. </p> <p>Like Trump, he hosts his own reality show, The Hydra Executives, an Arabic version of The Apprentice, albeit on a rather more extravagant scale than the Sir Alan Sugar version. The prize: $1m (\u00a3550,000) to invest in property. The takeover has cost around \u00a3210m and clears all City's outstanding debts. Thaksin had run into financial problems after the Thai courts froze \u00a3800m of his assets; he may never recover that after fleeing his home country last month to avoid multimillion-pound corruption charges. Thaksin was deposed as prime minister in a 2006 coup and has been described as a \"human rights abuser of the worst kind\" by Amnesty International </p> <p>His trial is taking place in his absence and the authorities in Thailand are investigating whether he can be extradited from London, where he is living in exile. In the meantime, he will relinquish his chairman's role at City but stay on as honorary president, with a minor stake.</p> <p>The new owners do not have the same baggage although, for the time being, there is mystery as to precisely which members of the UAE royal family are involved.</p> <p>Fahim said they had been contacted three weeks ago by a \"mutual friend,\" having previously considered investing in three other Premier League clubs. </p> <p>\"We've received a lot of offers and have been made aware of the possibility of 10%, 20% or 25% investments in Newcastle United, Liverpool and Arsenal. But there have been no real discussions and those possibilities have never gone anywhere. </p> <p>\"The only team and offer that grabbed my mind was Manchester City.\"</p> <p>The talks concluded in Dubai on Sunday night when Thaksin signed off his stake. City had managed to keep the news out of the public domain although the club's executive chairman, Garry Cook, had said recently that Thaksin was looking to bring in investment from \"some very wealthy friends\".</p> <p> Cook predicted great things for City. \"Can we be as big, or bigger, than Manchester United? Yes. Can we win the Premier League? Yes. Can we win the Champions League? Yes. It might take 10 years, maybe even longer. But we will.\" The new owners believe it will be even quicker. \"We don't have a lot of time,\" said Fahim. \"The money is not a worry for my board.\"</p> <p>He said the new owners would take an active role in the club and would attend City's next game. That will be against Chelsea on September 13, when City's supporters are planning to celebrate the new-found wealth by wearing Arab headgear.</p>",
  "<p>Samsung has been showing off its forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/global/experience/ifa2008/ifapress/html/popup_notepc01.html\">X360 laptop</a> at the IFA exhibition in Berlin. At 1.27 kg, it's lighter than a MacBook Air at 1.36kg. (There are lighter machines such as the Toshiba Portege, but with 12.1inch instead of 13.3inch screens.)</p> <p>Samsung says: \"the X360 sets a completely new standard in mobile computing -- offering a comprehensive set of features unlike anything of its kind on the market.\"</p> <p>Well, it has more features and ports than the heavily compromised Air, including a 7-in-1 card reader, three USB ports, PCI Express Card Slot (34mm), HDMI, VGA, RJ45 (Ethernet) and a docking slot. You can also have either a Solid State Drive (64GB or 128GB) or a traditional 120GB drive. Other features include a fingerprint reader, webcam, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.</p> <p>Unlike the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=macbook+air+overheating\">sometimes-overheating Air</a>, the X360 also has a proper ULV (Ultra Low Voltage) processor -- probably not cheap -- and X4500 graphics. With an SSD and 6-cell battery, this enables Samsung to claim a battery life of \"up to 10 hours\", depending on use. But I'll be impressed if I get more than 5 or 6 hours.....</p> <p>From what I can see of the various IFA videos and <a href=\"http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/08/28/ifa_samsung_launches_x360/page2.html\">photos</a>, the battery projects at the back, like most 6-cell packs. This gives Samsung no hope of getting anywhere near the \"thinnest\" machine. The X360's thickness is 1.67-3.09cm, which compares with the MacBook Air's 0.4-1.94 cm. Not that it makes the slightest bit of difference in reality. (Well, not from the point of view of portability. Thinner is just worse -- less usable -- if it means giving up ports, expansion slots and a removable battery.)</p> <p>From the photos and videos, it also looks <em>extremely</em> glossy, which may not go down too well with the comfortably-matt ThinkPad crowd.</p> <p>The X360 is expected to reach Europe next month. Samsung hasn't stated a price. I reckon it's unlikely to cost less than \u00a31,200 with a hard drive, but it could be in the same ballpark as the Air.</p>",
  "<p>After a very public debate on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree+environment/climatechange\">Guardian website</a> over the past few weeks, we have learned some lessons. Here are a few that come to mind. First, even carefully-crafted prose can be misunderstood. Throwaway lines, even those inserted parenthetically, can carry as much weight as key sentences. Second, attributing motive is dangerous, distracting, and frequently wrong; it should be avoided, not only because it has consequences for us as individuals, but also because it easily distracts attention from the value of our analytical work.</p> <p>To the extent that we have both been guilty of imprecision and attribution of motive in the heat of this debate, we are happy to report that cooler heads have prevailed. We recognise that despite our differences in view, we respect each other's commitment to robust public debate informed by different perspectives. To that end we both have agreed to forswear recent comments, and to wipe the slate clean. With this essay we'd like to show how people who disagree on policy options can still agree to collaborate productively, even under the hot glare of the very public, and very political, debate over climate change.</p> <p>And so, we offer here a mutually accepted rehearsal of the major conclusions of the challenge paper on climate change from the <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Default.aspx?ID=788\">Copenhagen consensus</a>, a review of the outcome from the expert panel deliberations, and some insight into what each of us thinks that this all means for policy.</p> <p>We agree that global warming is real, important and something that needs to handled.</p> <p>We agree that the risks of climate change are felt unevenly across the globe and even within countries. It is clear to both of us that many of the world's most disadvantaged \u2013 many of whom face the stark ramifications of the other problems considered in the Copenhagen consensus exercise \u2013 will bear a disproportionate share of the burden of climate change even as others enjoy some benefits born from modest warming.</p> <p>Gary, along with three co-authors, produced the challenge paper on climate change for the Copenhagen consensus 2008, where some of the world's top economists, including five Nobel laureates, offered their opinions about how to allocate a fixed amount of money to best solve the world's biggest problems. After reviewing briefly the impacts of anticipated climate change over the next century, the authors of the challenge paper considered three alternative policy responses.</p> <p>The first, a constrained \"mitigation alone\" option, failed the cost-benefit test because discounted benefits fell short of discounted costs. In the authors' opinion, however, this failure could be traced to faulty design. Allowing for more efficient allocation of mitigation efforts over time (with the major part of a reduction in the second half of the century), recognising uncertainty (including emissions scenarios that were higher and lower than the baseline), and/or including more timely participation by rapidly developing economies like China and India (the authors assumed that only developed countries constrained emissions before 2100) all pushed estimated benefits significantly above cost.</p> <p>Authors of the challenge paper ultimately recommended a portfolio of policies that included mitigation, significant early investment in research and development (R&amp;D) designed to accelerate the development and diffusion of carbon-friendly energy technologies as well as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/carboncapturestorage\">carbon capture and sequestration</a>, and targeted adaptation in the health sector. This option produced discounted benefits that were 2.7 times higher than cost.</p> <p>The expert panel ranked all of these options at the bottom of their priority list. They did not, however, dismiss climate change as a problem. They inserted an R&amp;D-only option into the 14th spot, based on work by another climate economist, <a href=\"http://people.mcgill.ca/christopher.green/\">Chris Green</a> of McGill University. Here we do disagree about the relative weight of the solutions. The panel and Chris Green found that investing in energy R&amp;D would have much higher benefits, at possibly 11 times the cost. As Bjorn has emphasised many times, what matters is getting low-cost, low-carbon technology available faster. If R&amp;D would make the price of renewables drop below the cost of fossil fuels by the middle of the century, everyone \u2013 including the Chinese and the Indians \u2013 would switch.</p> <p>The authors of the challenge paper, however, were disappointed because, in their minds, R&amp;D as a stand-alone policy was inferior to the portfolio approach. Their work showed that the benefits of such a policy would depreciate over time if economic incentives to adopt new carbon-friendly energy sources were not forthcoming. Indeed, carbon capture alternatives would have no market value if carbon were to be priced at zero.</p> <p>As we have moved to common ground, we take these results, the expert panel's deliberations, and our different opinions as strong evidence that policy design matters. We therefore agree that economic analysis has a significant role to play in making it clearer what policies should be implemented in order to tackle global warming most efficiently. Which emphasis is more appropriate? We will only find out if we keep pushing the questions forward. In either case, we agree that adaptation, CO2-cuts and R&amp;D in some combination are <em>all</em> necessary to tackle global warming.</p> <p>And now, we turn to our \"throw-away lines\". We agree emphatically that there is no place for hyperbole or hysteria in discussions about climate policy; panic isn't helpful for choosing the best policy responses. Moreover, we both see no place for mindless repetitions of the contrarian rhetoric that humans are not to blame every time climate policy is discussed; we are beyond that point.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important lesson that we already knew but should not have forgotten is even more fundamental and can be simply stated. The climate debate \u2013 and indeed the entire Copenhagen Consensus exercise \u2013 is not about us. It is about the future of the planet.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337189321\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>New Orleans appeared today to have been narrowly spared a repeat of the devastation of Katrina three years ago when Hurricane Gustav weakened in power and veered away to the west of the city in a last-minute reprieve.</p> <p>The hurricane was categorised downwards from force three to two just before it hit land near Cocodrie, a thinly populated town west of New Orleans known for its fishing and oil industries. Dramatic television footage showed waves being forced by winds of up to 110 mph over the tops of the flood defences on the west side of the city, in a worrying echo of what happened in 2005.</p> <p>Power supplies were cut to large parts of New Orleans as falling trees downed electricity lines and flattened several homes.</p> <p>Crucially, though, sea level surges were this time mercifully limited to up to 9ft in some places, markedly less than the 27ft surges that were seen with Katrina.</p> <p>As New Orleans heaved a huge sigh of relief, towns to the west, such as Lafayette and Baton Rouge, remained imperilled. Bobby Jindal, Louisiana's governor, warned that cataclysmic flooding could still be brought by the tail end of the hurricane.</p> <p>While Gustav failed to live up to the terrifying standards set by<br>Katrina, it still succeeded in leaving both communal and political<br>chaos in its wake. Almost two million people fled the Gulf of Mexico, the largest evacuation of its kind, turning New Orleans and other communities along the coast into virtual ghost towns.</p> <p>The first day of the Republican Convention in St Paul, Minnesota, was also disrupted as John McCain and his advisers struggled to find the appropriate tone. They were acutely aware of the need to avoid any association with President Bush's handling of Katrina, which was criticised for being negligent and insensitive, yet with the threat of Gustav diminishing they were also under pressure to salvage the wreckage of their own convention.</p> <p>McCain switched his planned appearances to focus on disaster relief in Ohio and a visit to Mississippi. Bush cancelled his speech to the convention and travelled instead to Texas, from where he might still address delegates by satellite link.</p> <p>At an emergency centre in Austin Texas, he acknowledged that planning for Gustav marked an improvement over the events of 2005. \"The coordination on this storm is a lot better than on - than during Katrina,\" he said.</p> <p>McCain and Bush's absences left their spouses, Cindy and Laura respectively, as well as the newly appointed vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, to hold centre stage at the convention.</p> <p>About 1,600 died in Katrina when 90,000 square miles were flooded, including 80 per cent of New Orleans. The lack of advance planning in 2005, and the sluggish federal response by the Bush administration, has gone down in history as one of America's most shameful moments.</p> <p>By contrast, both federal and local governments were quick this year to put emergency plans in place. Fema, the federal emergency management agency that was heavily criticised over its handling of Katrina, this time effected a five-day plan under its current chief, the homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff, that saw almost 90% of the region evacuated.</p> <p>Locally, New Orleans enacted a dawn-to-dusk curfew designed to prevent the epidemic of looting that broke out in 2005. In further echoes of Katrina, the streets of the city were lined with heavily armed police officers - though this time they were spared scenes of lawlessness.</p> <p>As the storm passes over the area, and the threat recedes, questions are likely to follow over the extreme nature of the preparations. The mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, appeared to go beyond the measured reports of the hurricane forecasters in encouraging the city's residents to evacuate.</p> <p>On Sunday night, he called Gustav the \"mother of all storms\" and warned anyone who ignored the exhortations to flee that they would be \"on their own\".</p> <p>\"It was absolutely the right message to send,\" Nagin told ABC News on today in defence of his earlier remarks.</p> <p>Katrina strengthened as it came ashore into a category 4 hurricane, and did so towards the north and east, pushing the waves directly towards New Orleans and breaching the levees on the east of the city. </p> <p>Gustav swung to the northwest, putting New Orleans on the \"dirty\" side of the hurricane where rainfall is heavy but the storm surge is milder.</p> <p>It hit the levees on the west of the city, coming at an angle with lesser force. Though the waves were seen to be sloshing over the flood walls, the defences were expected to hold.</p> <p>\"The system is not inundated, it is not a breach. We are confident in<br>the stability of that wall,\" said a spokeswoman of the US Army Corps of Engineers.</p> <p>Though the levees looked likely to retain their integrity on this<br>occasion, there are also likely to be questions once the initial crisis<br>has passed about the pace of repairs to New Orleans' defences. The<br>eastern wall, breached in 2005, has been repaired by the army corps in a rebuilding programme scheduled to last until 2012, but the threatened western wall has yet to be reinforced as a result of on-going under-funding.</p> <p>With the frequency and force of hurricanes in the region of the Gulf of Mexico also appearing to be on the rise, some say as a result of global warming, there is bound to be renewed soul-searching over the long-term viability of a sub-sea level city such as New Orleans.</p>",
  "<p>The danger posed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricanegustav\">Hurricane Gustav</a> to the people in the heart of New Orleans is not as great as it was during Katrina, because the storm surge is coming from a different direction. But there is still danger. With no electricity, there are no services.</p> <p>Most people are frightened to death. Many left days before the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/us/31orleans.html?ref=todayspaper\">official evacuation</a> began Sunday morning. People know, down to the tiniest detail, the ramifications of catastrophic flooding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2008/sep/01/climatechange.hurricanegustav\">should the levees not hold</a>.</p> <p>My family evacuated to my sister-in-law's condo in Baton Rouge, driving from New Orleans on back roads to avoid the crowded interstate. For the time being, there is still electricity, though power is now out at my home in uptown New Orleans, in the university area.</p> <p>New Orleans residents have hope, but they also did all the things responsible people do: sharing contact information with family and friends, boarding up houses, paying bills, buying supplies for power outages, turning off the gas, completely emptying out their refrigerators and freezers, parking cars on high ground, putting valuables up high or on the second floor, packing for weeks instead of days. Folks have all known since Monday last week exactly where they would evacuate. It was the talk of the town.</p> <p>In the minds of New Orleanians, the tragedy of Katrina was not the failed response. The tragedy was how, when Katrina barrelled through, New Orleans was overly vulnerable to storm surge, and that should never have happened. </p> <p>What happened during Katrina was engineering failure, not natural disaster.</p> <p>New Orleanians are not afraid of Gustav. They fear the failure of the federal levees. And design and construction of the levees is - by federal mandate in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_Control_Act_of_1965\">Flood Control Act of 1965</a> - the sole responsibility of the US Army Corps of Engineers.</p>",
  "<p>Another Premier League season, another little heard of Arab takeover looms into view. In echoes of the protracted love triangle between Tom Hicks, George Gillette and DIC over the ownership and future of Liverpool, another rich consortium on the banks of the Persian Gulf has dipped its toe into the waters of Premiership club ownership. This time, though, the Abu Dhabi United Group for Investment and Development [Adug], has met with markedly less resistance.</p> <p>Thaksin Shinawatra, the controversial ex-PM of Thailand who has been at Manchester City's helm for little more than a year, clearly thought it in the best interests of his club to step aside. With $3bn worth of assets still frozen by the Thai government, anti-Thaksin protests crippling Bangkok and a member of the Man City board having to throw in the odd \u00a32m loan to make sure the tea lady got her wages on time, it was clear his financial muscle had been curtailed. This is not a problem that Adug is ever likely to experience if, as expected, Man City's accounts are in order and it takes control of the club in two weeks time. But what do we know about the new owners?</p> <p>Initially, it appeared that the bid came from an offshoot of Abu Dhabi's huge sovereign investment fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. The United Arab Emirates is made up of seven small emirates, each run by its own absolute monarch. But Abu Dhabi is the biggest and most powerful of the seven, bigger even than Dubai. It is the seat of power, the nation's capital and also the emirate where almost all of the country's vast oil reserves, estimated at almost 10% of known oil worldwide, resides. It is thought that the Emir, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan, owns the richest sovereign fund in the world. Yet the Adug consortium has initially denied that the deal is connected to the government. According to Sulaiman Al Fahim, who brokered the deal and sits on Adug's board, it is merely a group of \"prestigious businessmen\". But in a society where patronage and royal decree are the driving forces behind business success, those closer to the deal suspect differently.</p> <p>\"This is all the Abu Dhabi royal family,\" explained Anil Bhoyrul, the former Mirror journalist who broke the story for his Dubai-based magazine Arabian Business. \"This [Adug] is essentially an investment vehicle set up for Man City and funded by sheikhs in the royal family. It's not exactly clear which sheikhs it is yet but this is the Abu Dhabi royal family.\" It is no surprise either that the deal has followed on the heels of DIC's attempts to buy Liverpool. Since the country's creation in 1971 \u2013 a move driven by Sheikh Khalifa's father, the revered late Sheikh Zayed \u2013 Dubai and Abu Dhabi have competed against each other for the world's affections, a rivalry that has gone into overdrive since the turn of the century.</p> <p>When Dubai built its own seven-star hotel, the Burj Al Arab, Abu Dhabi responded with its own, the Emirates Palace. When Dubai embarked on huge, glamorous construction projects that stole headlines across the world, Abu Dhabi followed suit with plans to build a Guggenheim and a Louvre. Even sporting events have witnessed this economic one-upmanship, with Abu Dhabi setting up a rival to Dubai's PGA tour golf event and tennis tournament.<br>From the outside, it appeared that Abu Dhabi resented the success of its glamorous neighbour. Dubai's royal family had been so successful in branding the emirate that many assumed that it, and not Abu Dhabi, was the capital of the UAE. So when DIC, itself an investment arm of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's sovereign fund, tried and failed to buy a Premier League club, Abu Dhabi just had to keep up with the Joneses. Well, the Maktoums.</p> <p>\"DIC was actually looking at Man City, and then the Abu Dhabi people came in,\" explains Bhoyrul. \"Apparently they were told by Man City that they couldn't deal with them at first as they were already dealing with someone from Dubai! But that changed when they explained they were from Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi is competing with Dubai to be a global player. There is a huge rivalry between the two.\" Man City fans have already come to terms with the fast-paced life of being a petrodollar plaything: a top-four finish this season has been promised with Champions League football to follow. And if Dimitar Berbatov's move goes through before the deadline it will represent only the start of a huge recruitment drive. Already a list of six players has been drawn up to be targeted in the January transfer window. The list, Bhoyrul says, will \"make Berbatov's signing pale in comparison\".</p> <p>Of course, rich sugar daddies have come in before with their smooth moves, making grand promises and wooing us with some intoxicated lovelorn chat only to sneak out in the morning with the family silver while we're still sleeping. But there are signs that this investment has a stronger footing than, say, Hicks and Gillette's investment in Liverpool. The aim of any business is to turn a profit, but there are far more important forces at work. The motivation here has a tinge of nationalism. Buying Man City is as much about putting Abu Dhabi's flag in the sand. The emirate wants to be a global sports hub, and there's no better way of fast-tracking that than buying one of the grande dames of English football. It is also ample evidence that the world's financial power base is shifting eastwards. But more importantly than that, the capture of Man City gets one over on Abu Dhabi's glamorous neighbours over their Eastern border. And that, they will conclude, is worth any price.</p> <p><em>When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone (Mainstream), by James Montague, is out now</em></p>",

  "<p><strong>GREAT SHEIKHS?</strong></p> <p>There are many ways to trigger power shifts in football. There's the Real Madrid model, which entails harnessing the might and vanity of a fascist state; there's the Liverpool model, which involves abdicating from a position of dominance by appointing Graeme Souness as manager; there's the England model, which involves abdicating from a position of dominance by turning into a nation of fat brawlers and numb-brained wasters; and, of course, there's the most common model, the one pursued over the years, with varying degrees of success, by Woolwich Arsenal, Parma, Red Bull Salzburg, Nasty Leeds, Chelsea, Bad Boys Inc, Gretna, Hoffenheim and - now - Manchester City.</p> <p>City, of course, already had a tilt at this approach last season, when, like gold-digging floozies in a St Tropez clip joint, they allowed themselves to be groped and fondled by an ageing businessman who, it turned out, wasn't quite as flush as they'd hoped. Every cloud has a golden shower, however, and today it emerged that troubled Thai Thaksin Shinawatra has sold his stake in City to Arab sugar daddies who really do have more money than you could stick a sheik for.</p> <p>\"Manchester City can confirm that a Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the Abu Dhabi United Group [Adug] and Manchester City Football Club Limited,\" read a catchy club statement today, before adding excitingly: \"A period of due diligence for all parties, including the FA Premier League, has now been entered.\" Adug's top banana is Dr Sulaiman Al-Fahim, who has access to a fortune so big it can be seen from space.</p> <p>\"Our goal is very simple: to make Manchester City the biggest club in the Premier League, and to begin with to finish in the top four this season,\" bellowed Al-Fahim, as he playfully dunked Roman Abramovich's yacht into his bath tub. Just in case the fact that they waited until the day the transfer window closes to reveal the takeover provoked suspicions that they won't, in fact, be willing to bankroll the sort of lavish expenditure that makes fans obnoxious with triumphalism, the new owners today made a bold and highly amusing statement of intent: by attempting to blow neighbours Manchester United out of the water with a \u00a330m+ bid for Dimitar Berbatov. Reports claim Sir Alex Ferguson is green with envy, even though Berbatov is meeting with Man Utd suits as we type. Of course the Fiver remains doubtful that the Bulgarian will join City rather than United, or that Ferguson's pallor is any colour other than purple.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"We received a complaint from a member of the public during the Arsenal v Newcastle Premier League match. Following this complaint a man received words of advice for consuming alcohol in a prohibited area\" - the Metropolitan police issue a statement explaining how they dealt with Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, who was caught on camera necking a pint of beer in his seat at the Emirates on Saturday.

Watching Ian Payne and his stony-faced sidekick in action with the sound turned down this morning, you could be forgiven for assuming they were delivering a grim bulletin detailing genocide in Rwanda or the outbreak of a world war.

After tying up the remaining loose ends in their \u00a314m Roman Pavlyuchenko deal into a neat little bow, they peeled off another \u00a38.5m in tenners and gave it to Manchester City for Vedran Corluka. \"I am delighted,\" chirruped the Croatian defender at some passing Arabs on his way out of Eastlands. \"I am coming to a big club with great players, great ambition and also my best friend [Luka Modric] is here so it is a very happy day for me.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere, Scotland defender Steven Pressley prompted an unprecedented flurry of Googling when it was announced that he had shaken off his free agent status by signing for Randers FC. \"It's in Denmark,\" chorused thousands of harassed and hungover looking blokes wearing poorly-ironed shirts in offices everywhere. \"Oh and look ... it says here that Colin Todd is their manager.\" Of course while the Fiver could spend all afternoon wittering on about the rest of the big deadline day news - Nadir Belhadj to Portsmouth on loan, Steve Finnan to Espanyol, Jason Shacke ... <em>Steve Finnan to where?!?!?!?</em> - we've set up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/01/transferdeadlineday.live\">this doo-dah</a> instead, which should be fifth or sixth with all the latest transfer news.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>FANTASY FOOTBALL</strong></p> <p>Go on, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fantasyfootball\">play it</a>.</p> <p><strong>Guardian Pick the Score</strong></p> <p>Go on, <a href=\"http://guardian.pickthescore.co.uk/\">pick it</a>.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Today?

  "<p>Gordon Brown today brushed off speculation about the future of the chancellor, Alistair Darling, following his warning that the economy was facing possibly the worst downturn in 60 years.</p> <p>The prime minister insisted that ministers were \"getting on with the business of government\".</p> <p>Brown sought to allay concerns as the City reacted negatively to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/30/alistairdarling.economy\">comments made by Darling in a Guardian article</a> in which he said Britain's economic circumstances were \"arguably the worst they've been in 60 years \u2026 And I think it's going to be more profound and long-lasting than people thought.\"</p> <p>Darling's comments were seen to be at odds with Brown's claims that Britain is well-placed to face the economic downturn.</p> <p>The chancellor later sought to clarify his remarks by stressing that the downturn was a worldwide phenomenon. </p> <p>Brown sought to present a united front as Darling's remarks threatened to overshadow his autumn economic relaunch, which will start tomorrow with an announcement about housing.</p> <p>Speaking in Brussels, where he is attending the EU emergency summit on Georgia, Brown emphasised that the current economic difficulties were due to the \"unique circumstances\" of the trebling of world oil prices combined with the international credit crunch. He told reporters: \"We are getting on with the business of government.\"</p> <p>Brown added: \"We are showing that, unlike previous governments that could not manage a way through these difficulties successfully, that we are resilient in the way that we deal with these problems,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I think that you will find that the actions that we have taken and the actions that we are taking are actions that are designed to help the British people get through what is a difficult world economic downturn.\"</p> <p>Earlier today, the prime minister's spokesman insisted that it \"goes without saying\" that Brown has \"full confidence\" in his chancellor.</p> <p>Following Darling's comments, which were published on Saturday, the pound hit a record low against the euro when markets opened this morning. The FTSE 100 index also fell steadily today and was almost 1% lower by mid-afternoon.</p> <p>To add to the government's difficulties, figures published this morning showed the number of new mortgages being issued down 71% since July last year.</p> <p>David Cameron described Darling's remarks over the weekend as \"extraordinary\".</p> <p>The Tory leader told BBC Radio 4 Today programme earlier today: \"I think it's extraordinary that the chancellor said it, because \u2013 remember \u2013 a chancellor of the exchequer has got to think not only 'I must tell the truth at all times' but also 'I must use my words carefully, so that I don't actually create a situation that's even worse, that creates a crisis of confidence'.\"</p> <p>This morning some analysts were claiming that Darling's comments were responsible for the fall in the value of sterling. \"Most people believed that things were probably deteriorating faster in the UK than the government was admitting, but the fact that we've seen the chancellor come out and admit that things are far worse have put sterling under pressure,\" said Ian Stannard, a senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.</p> <p>Darling's frank remarks about the state of the economy, contrasting with the prime minister's mild language, have prompted Tory claims that the government is \"dysfunctional\".</p> <p>Downing Street and the Treasury have insisted that there is no tension between Brown and Darling, claiming they are focused on measures to help people struggling with the downturn. But <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4648993.ece\">today's Times reports that Brown is planning a cabinet reshuffle</a> - contradicting what Darling said in his Guardian interview. The paper also refers to speculation that Darling could be one of those moved.</p> <p>The controversy comes at a damaging time, because the government is about to make a series of economic-recovery announcements that ministers hope will restore Labour's fortunes. Some Labour MPs believe the measures represent Brown's \"last chance\", and that if they don't help to lift the party's standing in the polls he should be replaced as prime minister.</p> <p>The first initiative will be announced tomorrow, when the government unveils plans to help millions of less well-off people gain - or at least not lose - a place on the housing ladder. This is likely to include a \"shared equity\" plan in which local authorities and housing associations help borrowers in return for a stake in their homes. Next week ministers will unveil plans to help people with rising fuel bills when the first cabinet of the new season will be held in Birmingham. This is expected to include measures to improve energy efficiency.</p> <p>In a speech to the CBI on Thursday, Brown will underline the depth of the global economic problems, which demand a global response. \"The credit crunch has shown that while we now have a global economy that is more integrated than ever before, from which no national economy is insulated, we do not have adequate means of managing it other than as nations or regional entities,\" he will say.</p> <p>But Brown will say that Britain is well-placed to weather the downturn: \"In the next 20 years the world economy will double in its size and wealth and we have a great opportunity to win new business, new jobs and prosperity for Britain.\"</p> <p>Looking ahead to the expected announcements on housing and fuel, the PM's spokesman said: \"The way that the prime minister would characterise these announcements is that, clearly, we are facing a challenging international economic situation at the moment that is affecting the UK just as it is affecting other countries.</p> <p>\"We need to continue to work with our international partners to deal with the international issues around the credit crunch, global food prices and global commodity prices.</p> <p>\"But we also need to continue to look at what more we can do in order to help people in this country directly affected by these global challenges.</p> <p>\"We have already taken action in relation to housing and the mortgage market. We have already taken action in relation to helping people with their fuel bills. As the prime minister and other ministers have been saying in recent weeks, we want to continue to see what more we can do to help those affected.\"</p>",
  "<p>If one man stands between the EU and a lasting resolution of the Caucasus crisis, that man is Vladimir Putin. As Europe's leaders struggled to agree a response to Georgia's enforced partition ahead of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/01/russia.foreignpolicy\">today's emergency summit</a> in Brussels, Russia's <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/2658077/Vladimir-Putin-the-hero-saves-TV-crew-from-tiger-attack.html\">gun-toting prime minister</a> was pictured strutting across the Siberian taiga, wearing camouflage and a tough expression, doing his familiar \"Action Man\" impersonation.</p> <p>Putin's controlling hand has been in evidence since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">fighting erupted</a> last month. He flew immediately from Beijing to visit Russian invasion troops at staging areas on the Georgian border. It was Putin who muddied the waters with talk of legitimate Russian peacekeeping operations and unsubstantiated claims of genocide and \"ethnic cleansing\". It is Putin who now mocks talk of EU sanctions and hints at diverting Russian oil and gas from Europe to China.</p> <p>But for the most part Putin has used his hand-picked presidential successor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/03/russia\">Dmitri Medvedev</a>, as front man in fielding international outrage. While Medvedev dealt with French president Nicolas Sarkozy's frantic mediation efforts, fought the PR battle through stage-managed media interviews, and took the flak for Moscow's recognition of South Ossetian and Abkhazian independence, Putin deftly pulled the strings.</p> <p>Medvedev's stand-up role as a sort of home-grown \"useful idiot\" seems to have freed Putin from the constraints normally facing a head of state, allowing him greater freedom of action. Backroom manipulation appears to suit the former KGB spy. But he has developed a taste for personal headline-grabbing, too, as shown by his Siberian tiger shoot and his black arts propaganda skills in <a href=\"http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LT666072.htm\">turning the tables</a> on the Bush administration.</p> <p>\"We know there were a lot of US advisers in Georgia. But (they) should be on firing ranges and teaching centres \u2013 but where were they? They were in the zone of military operations,\" Putin told German television at the weekend. \"That pushes one to the conclusion that the US leadership knew about the action that was being prepared and morever probably took part in it.</p> <p>\"If the US leadership has sanctioned that, then I have the suspicion that it was done specially to organise a small victorious war. And if that didn't work, then to create from Russia the appearance of an enemy and unite the (US) electorate around one presidential candidate.\"</p> <p>Putin went on: \"In a significant way the crisis was provoked, including by our American friends in the course of the elections struggle \u2026 This was the use of administrative resources in a deplorable way to provide advantage to one of the candidates, in the current case from the ruling (Republican) party.\"</p> <p>That the man who between 2000 and 2008 emasculated Russia's democratic institutions, silenced media and business critics, and eradicated independent centres of political and civil power should complain about \"administrative abuses\" will strike many as ironic. But that is not the main point at issue.</p> <p>The idea that Washington neocon warriors were somehow responsible for a full-scale Russian military invasion by land, air and sea of a tiny neighbour appeals greatly to western apologists, whose voices have grown shrill in recent weeks. More generally it plays on anti-American sentiment in Europe. That was Putin's calculated aim.</p> <p>While there is no evidence to support such a convoluted conspiracy theory, his words sent a chill. They revealed how implacable his hostility has become to what he perceives as Washington's quasi-imperial unipolarism, expressed most obviously through Nato's eastwards expansion. Putin's utter determination, aggressive style and deep cynicism suggest a comfortable, or even a mutually tolerant relationship between Russia on the one hand and the US and European allies such as Britain on the other is improbable as long as he wields back-seat-driver power.</p> <p>This may come as no surprise to those, such as journalist Alan Cowell, who have followed Putin's rise and rise from the apartment block bombings and the second Chechen war in 1999 to the murder in London in 2006 of Kremlin foe Alexander Litvineneko. Cowell's new book about Litvinenko, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/30/crime\">The Terminal Spy</a>, is written against a backdrop of Putin's ruthless rise to an unassailable position at the head of a power structure he remodelled to suit himself.</p> <p>Putin would probably never have become a friend. But his enmity might have been avoided if western leaders had listened more carefully at the beginning. Speaking at the Genoa G8 summit in 2001, Putin said Russia would defend its strategic independence but neither did it pose a threat. He urged the US to maintain the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty and forego missile defence and cooperate instead on constructing new, post-cold war global security structures.</p> <p>Nato's expansion was fuelling insecurity on Europe's edges, he said. Specifically he called for a \"single security and defence space\" in Europe to be created either by replacing Nato or having Russia join it as a full member.</p> <p>He was ignored. And although this in theory is still Russia's position, with Putin and his US counterparts no longer on speaking terms and relations with the west under severe strain, the chance for collaboration has been missed. In Washington a new leader may bring a new approach. But Putin and Putinism, part Bush era collateral damage, part Russian dysfunction, seem set to go on indefinitely.</p>",
  "<p>One has to be careful when making jokes about the Republican presidential campaign. They may turn out to be true. </p> <p>A month ago I wrote a column saying that <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-&amp;-columns/op-eds-&amp;-columns/john-mccain-wants-to-drill-in-your-toilet/\">John McCain wants to drill in your toilet</a>. This comment was intended as a joke at the time, but it turns out to pretty much reflect the Republican position. The Republicans' most effective slogan for the fall election is \"drill here, drill now.\" It all depends on your definition of \"here\".</p> <p>The basic issue is straightforward. There is very little oil potentially available in the areas in which the Republicans are anxious to drill here and now. The <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/\">Energy Information Agency</a> (these are people who work for President Bush) estimates that the oil in the offshore protected areas will eventually add about 0.2% to world's daily oil output. This would be sufficient to lower the price of gas by 3-4 cents a gallon.</p> <p>Furthermore, even with the best efforts to drill here and now, it will <a href=\"http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/7/10/142042/915\">still take many years</a> to get any oil whatsoever from these protected areas. Regardless of how anxious McCain and the Republicans might be to damage the environment, oil companies will not just spend tens of millions of dollars blindly drilling deepwater wells. They first have to survey the terrain carefully and then dig test wells. The EIA projects that it will take 10 years before we get the first drops of oil from drilling in currently protected areas and close to 20 years before we get our full 3-4 cent a gallon savings. That won't do a lot of good for people trying to make ends meet this year.</p> <p>The remarkable story here is that the people who follow energy policy know these basic facts. Yet, the Republicans are pushing the drill here, drill now line because they are betting the public can be kept in the dark. Just as tens of millions of people supported the war in Iraq because they thought that Saddam Hussein was tied to the attack on the World Trade Center, the Republicans are betting that they gain votes in November because tens of millions of people will believe that they are offering a credible plan to substantially reduce gas prices in the new future.</p> <p>In this respect, they are counting on their allies in major national media outlets like CBS, NBC, NPR, the New York Times and Washington Post. The job of the media is to inform the public. If the media effectively informed the public on this issue, they would be telling people that the Republicans are proposing an energy policy that can at best have a very modest impact on oil prices in the distant future, and no impact whatsoever for the near-term future. The Republicans are betting that the media doesn't bust them and tell the public the truth on this one.</p> <p>So far, the Republican's faith has been rewarded. Few news stories have given the public the facts on the oil available in the offshore protected areas. As a result, polls show that the majority of voters believe that drilling in these areas can have a substantial impact on oil prices in the very near future. </p> <p>Perhaps we should introduce a system of merit pay for reporters and news producers in which their pay depends on their success in educating the public on key issues, just as many school districts make the pay of school teachers dependent on how well their students perform. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/25/AR2008082502215.html\">School teachers </a>whose students perform badly don't get raises and could even get fired. Imagine that we applied the same standards to CBS, NBC, NPR and the Washington Post. If their audience couldn't answer basic questions about important public policy issues then the reporters responsible get their pay cut. If the audiences are especially poorly informed, then the reporters get fired.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this sort of accountability in the media doesn't exist. Most political reporters sound like high school drama coaches as they spend their time talking about candidates' appearance and speaking mannerisms. They almost never bother to discuss the positions advocated by the candidates \u2013 that might require a few minutes of real work. </p> <p>Of course the candidates know that the reporters won't ever bother to verify the claims they make, which gives them incentive to make whatever outlandish claims are most convenient. This is why we have McCain promising to drill for oil in our toilets and most voters actually believing that this will lower the price of gas.</p>",
  "<p>Environmental protesters caused almost \u00a330,000 worth of damage after painting the name Gordon on a power station chimney, a court heard today.</p> <p>Five activists spent 30 hours at the top of the massive chimney after breaking into Kingsnorth power station near Hoo, Kent, in October last year.</p> <p>The environmentalists, some of whom were Greenpeace volunteers, were protesting about the re-development of the coal-burning power station.</p> <p>Maidstone crown court was told that the protesters had planned to daub \"Gordon, bin it\" on the outside of the chimney in a direct statement to the prime minister Gordon Brown.</p> <p>The defendants who scaled the chimney are Huw Williams, 41, from Nottingham; Ben Stewart, 34, from Lyminge, Kent; Kevin Drake, 44, from Westbury, Wiltshire; Will Rose, 29, from London and Emily Hall, 34, from New Zealand. They are all charged with criminal damage.</p> <p>Tim Hewke, 48, from Ulcombe, Kent, who the prosecution says helped organise the protest from the ground, is also charged with criminal damage.</p> <p>John Price, prosecuting, said the defendants had arrived at the power station at around 6.30am on October 8 dressed in orange boilersuits and white hard hats bearing the Greenpeace logo. They had headed straight for the chimney which dominates the site. Armed with bags containing abseiling gear, the five scaled the chimney.</p> <p>Price said they were persuaded to come down before they could finish their message after being threatened with a high court injunction.</p> <p>He told the jury of three men and nine women that the issue of damage being caused to the chimney was not to be disputed during the trial but that the legality of causing the damage in the first place would form the central issue of the case.</p> <p>The defendants, he said, all maintained that they were lawfully right to damage the power station as they believed doing so would prevent further damage to properties being caused around the world by global warming.</p> <p>But Mr Price said the acts committed by the protesters were \"not capable of being lawful\". He told the jury that the case was not a prosecution of free speech or legitimate political protest but a prosecution for crossing the line of acceptable protest.</p> <p>\"There are things you can lawfully do in making a protest but there's a line which has to be drawn.

  "<p>Georgia has admitted dropping cluster bombs during its attempt to regain control of its breakaway province of South Ossetia, a human rights group said today.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch said it had received a letter from the Georgian defence ministry acknowledging the use of M85 cluster bombs near the Roki tunnel that connects South Ossetia with Russia. </p> <p>Georgia launched its ill-fated campaign to retake South Ossetia last month, prompting Russia to invade Georgia and occupy Georgian territory. Human Rights Watch has <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/14/georgi19625.htm\">accused Russia of using cluster bombs</a> in populated areas in Georgia, killing at least 11 civilians and injuring dozens.</p> <p>The New York-based group last month called on Russia to immediately stop using cluster bombs, which 100 countries recently agreed to ban.</p> <p>\"Cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw. Russia's use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians, but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines,\" Marc Garlasco, a senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch, said recently.</p> <p>The South Ossetia conflict was the first time cluster bombs were deployed since the Lebanon war in 2006, when M85s were used extensively by Israel against Hizbullah.</p> <p>Cluster munitions, which contain dozens or hundreds of smaller submunitions or bomblets, have been condemned because of their capacity to kill and maim civilians. Many do not immediately explode, causing civilian casualties for months or years to come. </p> <p>In May, 107 nations agreed to a total ban on cluster munitions, but Russia did not take part in the talks. Russia was not part of the Oslo process launched in February 2007 to develop a new international treaty banning cluster munitions. </p> <p>The convention on cluster munitions agreed in May comprehensively bans the use, production, trade and stockpiling of the weapon. It will be open for signature in Oslo on December 3.</p>",
  "<h2>1. Climbing Huayna Potosi, Bolivia</h2> <p>Reality dawned as I tested boots, crampons, jumpsuits, ice axes and snow-goggles. This is serious, I thought, it's a proper mountain. Anxious, we wound our way out of the basin of La Paz and on to the surrounding plateau.</p> <p>Abandoned mines and multi-coloured lakes provided stunning views, while the numerous miners' graveyards proved sobering. Arriving at the refugio, built on the banks of a dammed lake of white blue water in the Zongo valley, we lunched, kitted up and headed out to the glacier for basic ice-climbing training. Swing axe, kick feet. Repeat. Easy. The beginner slopes were quickly scaled. The final wall proved tough. I managed it after a great deal of swearing and falling. Heading home in the dark I was scared about what the actual climb would be like. </p> <p>After gorging on breakfast, we hiked for three hours to base-camp before settling down to get some sleep before our departure. I failed miserably but nobody else slept either.</p> <p>2am. Coca tea and energy bars, then out into the inky blackness, head-torches glowing. The wind that had plagued our sleep was gone. It was still, clear and very cold. We donned our crampons, roped up and set off. </p> <p>After two hours of hiking we reached the first of our \"technical passes\", which wasn't too hard at all, 60 metres up in less than 10 minutes. I was feeling great, cold, but the body was ticking over nicely and I had a good rhythm going. On we plodded with the stars and an incredible electric storm on a distant range for company. The storm illuminated the clouds in deep, biblical reds and oranges as the lightning reflected off our glacier, while far off the lights of La Paz twinkled like a toytown. The cold set in, my feet were numb, my thumbs and arms were in agony and the ice axe grew very heavy. Two hours later, we arrived at the final pass, our route to the summit blocked by our first set back - we were early. To catch sunrise we would have to wait in the \u201320C temperature for 15 minutes. We waited five and decided to climb.</p> <p>Slowly I controlled my breathing, pushed my fear of falling away, and shuffled up the steep ice-face. About halfway up, dawn broke. I have never seen a sunrise like it. Sunlight shot out of the electrical storm and lit up the peak like a beacon. We sat, on top of the world, in silence, taking it all in. </p> <p>Abseiling was the only way down and it took us less than three hours, in the most stunning glacial surroundings under the glaring sun, to get back to the Refugio. We were dead on our feet. Back in La Paz I attempted to celebrate but dinner and a long sleep was the best I could manage.<br><strong>Matthew Harding, London</strong></p> <h2>2. Trekking the wild coast of South Africa</h2> <p>We were lucky, to be honest. As we set off for our two-week 200km trek along the wild coast of South Africa, we did not have a map. But we did not need one as all we needed to do was keep the ocean on our left, and keep moving forward. Having spent three months at university in Cape Town, I and three friends decided we wanted to experience something more of South Africa. We travelled to Durban, staying in a cockroach-ridden hostel, and caught a bus to the Wild Coast Casino. The easiest way to get as close to the coast as possible was with the Wild Coast Casino bus. When we arrived we were itching to get moving, as a casino was not our idea of an adventure.</p> <p>We got off the bus and started walking towards the ocean. That is how we started. Every day for six days we walked along the beach until we felt we couldn't anymore. The sun set disarmingly quickly and the first night left us in the dark before we could take off our boots. We built a fire next to a cliff, and from the edge of the light came two boys carrying fish strung together on a line. From the time we had left the casino, these were the first people we had seen. We greeted them in Xhosa and shared our pasta and beans as they turned their fish on the fire with their hands, jumping back and laughing at the sparks. We slept deeply.</p> <p>We came across hidden waterfalls, waded through rivers up to our shoulders with our backpacks on top of our heads, and walked through Xhosa villages as children yelled and women laughed in the doorways when we became frightened of the dogs barking after us. We stopped at the shop in a village and drank their last two-litre glass bottle of Coke, passing it around so that we could empty it and give it back. Women sold us avocados that were not ripe and we ate them anyway. We drank Xhosa beer. We turned a corner through a bit of brush and startled two zebras and their baby, as baboons galloped along in the distance and the dusk began to settle. </p> <p>On the sixth day we made it across the Umzimvubu river and to Port St Johns. Our time in Port St Johns (PSJ) was spent recovering at Jungle Monkey Backpackers, where we sat on the roof, ate toasties and marvelled that we had gotten this far. We would be travelling through Hluleka Nature Reserve for the next leg and needed a permit from the parks office, at Second Beach in PSJ, near to a caf\u00e9 set up in an old caravan called The Wood 'n' Spoon, where to my amazement they had fresh buffalo mozzarella.</p> <p>Never in my life have I come across such beauty and such kindness of people, and such incredible chance encounters. We were so lucky. <br><strong>Emily Cummings, London</strong></p> <h2>3. A Skye kayaking adventure</h2> <p>My Dad thinks he's a pirate. I've known that for a while, ever since he started wearing a bandana to protect his head from the sun. What I only realised this holiday was that he reckons he's a bullfighter too.</p> <p>This year was the Skye Kayaking Adventure (mark II). \"Would you describe yourself as a kayaker?\" I asked my brother halfway through the week, \"Nah,\" he answered, \"Well, maybe this week\u2026 but not for the rest of the year.\" That pretty much sums up our kayaking, we go once, maybe twice, a year (promising Mum that \"we won't fall in\"), escape disaster, and return home (assuring Mum that \"everything was fine\"). This year's trip was a week kayaking and wild camping around Skye and Soay. </p> <p>So we booked the kayaks, packed up the tents and stocked up on cheese in a tube. We wrapped everything in bin bags and plastered it in gaffer tape. When we arrived the sun was (almost) out and the midges were (definitely) out. Nevertheless, the initial views of the Scottish Highlands and sightings of wild deer meant spirits were high for our first night of camping.</p> <p>The next day the sea was flat and the Cullins appearing around the corner made the perfect backdrop to our kayaking. Moreover, we found an ideal camping spot: enough drift wood for a fire, but not too much to render it a rubbish tip; enough wind to keep the midges at bay, without bringing down the tents. Our own private paradise, and with each whisky the scene became ever more perfect. We all went to bed happy.</p> <p>At 7am an unexpected alarm clock sounded. The perfection crumbled as it dawned on us that we'd camped in the breakfast spot of a herd of wandering cows. We'd missed the vital clue: cow pats. I don't like big animals, especially cows. I'm scared that they may get spooked and stampede, or, even worse, realise that they're big and we're small. When I'm trapped in a tent with them outside, the fear increases 10-fold. When I realise there's a bull in the ranks, I run. </p> <p>Dad has a theory that bulls in a herd aren't any danger, provided you leave them be. We didn't stay to find out and retreated to the rocks. After three hours kept prisoner, just time for a bowl of porridge and a skinny-dip (as bully was holding the swimming gear hostage), I reluctantly agreed to test the theory. Under close surveillance from you-know-who, we began to de-camp. </p> <p>Dad's theory was right that time, (but are all bulls so complacent?), and for the rest of the week both the sea and the wildlife were good to us. We had some amazing paddles and camped in some spectacular places. For anyone planning a kayaking holiday I'd recommend Skye and the Small Isles \u2026 and, if you can find it, Bull Bay makes a great camping spot. Just remember to show the landlord some respect, and you'll be fine. <br><strong>Jenny Slater, Wakefield, West Yorkshire</strong></p> <h2>Hitching across Eastern Europe</h2> <p>Faced with a limited budget and a demanding itinerary, I decided that if I were to see Eastern Europe this year, then I would have to hitch. The journey would take me from Paris to Sofia, passing through Berlin, Wroclaw, Prague, Bratislava, Budapest, and Bucharest. This trip was to be a leap of faith \u2013 any chance of success would depend entirely on the arbitrary kindness of strangers. </p> <p>I began by using community wikis and satellite imaging to find the best hitching spots out of the cities I'd pass through. I learnt that, from a hitcher's perspective, a motorway toll is like a free, long-haul train service which departs every other minute. Border controls, service stations, lay-bys, and slip roads, are all viable, but slightly slower alternatives.</p> <p>Like most of the other travellers I met, I used hospitality exchange websites to find accommodation. Luckily, most of my hosts had time to introduce me to their friends or families. They took me to their favourite hang-outs, or to see the hidden and special places which are found only after months of living in a city. I stayed in a Christian commune in Nuremberg and a squatted slaughterhouse in Berlin. I met a Polish hairdresser and we took a train ride around Wroclaw. </p> <p>Of course, it was inevitable there would sometimes be problems. Come nightfall, I was either drinking a celebratory beer, or left stranded by the roadside. I slept in a car park in Germany, a farm trailer in Hungary, and in a field in Transylvania. Immersed in this itinerant lifestyle, I imagined that one could travel for years like this.</p> <p>It seemed paradoxical that such a transient travelling style could be so culturally immersive. So many times I was given a ride and then invited back for a family dinner. When I told people what I was doing, it made them want to help even more. This was the alchemist effect, the universal conspiracy to help me safely reach Sofia. </p> <p>I rode with a French priest on a pilgrimage, a Bulgarian celebrity vet, a pair of Greek CV enthusiasts, and an expectant mother called Marta. We talked together and the adventure became theirs as much as it was mine. 56 different rides and 4,000 kilometres later, I arrived in Sofia. For nothing more than a little faith in humanity, you can go as far as you need.<br><strong>Ric Bottomley, Settle, North Yorkshire</strong></p> <h2>5. Treehouses and leeches in India</h2> <p>Ernakulam station on a humid morning. We were travelling to the Wayanad area of Kerala to stay in a tree house and, possibly, just possibly, see a tiger, and we had elected to go by train instead of taking the road. </p> <p>As the Keralan landscape unfolded past the windows, a small girl stroked my arm and another young lady shyly tried out her English. The train pulled into a junction and suddenly filled with food vendors and the carriage became a microcosm of the sheer excitement and colour of India.</p> <p>Eventually, we reached Calicut - ahead lay a two-hour journey towards the hills. The lively towns and villages flashed by and brightly coloured lorries crawled along steep inclines, practically stopping as they negotiated the hairpin bends. The country became green and lush and we had arrived \u2013 nearly.</p> <p>We stopped to inquire the way at a village and could see heads being shaken and shoulders shrugged. Apparently our tree house had closed down\u2026<br>In view of subsequent events, that would probably have been an advantage. </p> <p>We were hailed by a young man from the other side of the road and it transpired that he was the guide that we needed. We climbed into a decrepit jeep and headed off road and on to a rough track that wound its way further into the hills. By now it was dark and all we could see \u2013 from the beam of the flickering headlights - was a tiny light in the distance, our destination. We asked about the treehouse. On went a searchlight and a huge tree came into view. The \"house\" was 100ft up and we were to be put into something that resembled a gibbet to be hauled up to our accommodation. </p> <p>The house had a bathroom, a bedroom and a sitting area. We were there till the morning with instructions to shout when we were ready for breakfast and we would be let down. Lights went out at 10pm to conserve energy and we snuggled into a surprisingly comfortable bed. Despite a conviction that we had not been alone overnight, we slept amazingly well.</p> <p>The next day we opted for a guided walk and set off to enjoy ourselves. Our guide was equipped with tissues and Dettol and we soon found out why. Leeches. My poor husband was soon bleeding profusely and had to spend the rest of the afternoon with one leg in the air. That evening there was a terrific storm \u2013 we were assured that the tree was safe but I was very glad to get down in the morning. And we didn't even see a tiger.<br><strong>Sally Brown, Kelvedon, Essex</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Down on 'the farm' in New Zealand</h2> <p>One\u2026 two\u2026 three\u2026 four... FIVE pukeko birds, dad! <br> Wow, five pukeko, I remark excitedly to James, my four-year-old son, as we circumnavigate another 180-degree bend, on New Zealand's Old Russell Road, which winds its way like an elaborate Maori tattoo around the Tutukaka coast. We are on our way to \"the farm\", a semi-mythical destination that holds the same allure to me \u2013 a 35-year-old \"parentpacker\" - as Alex Garland's The Beach did 12 years ago. </p> <p>The \"family friendly\" backpackers' place had been revealed to me, conspiratorially, by a Swedish backpacking parent with a combi van and two impossibly beautiful barefoot kids in a caf\u00e9 on the K Road, 24 hours after we'd touched down in Auckland. Observing my two charges jack-in-the-box around having been hemmed into a pressurised container for 28 hours, he handed me a crumpled hand-written map and said, \"I think they'd like this place\".</p> <p>Still clutching the map as the 100th pukeko of the journey is sighted, we drive up to the old homestead that is tucked neatly into undulating bush-clad hills and are greeted in spontaneous fashion by a charging sow and its piglets, two hyperactive farm dogs and a band of wild things in bare feet. Our two children are immediately involved in a frantic game of touch rugby orchestrated by Vinny, an Irish backpacker, who is WOOFing his way around New Zealand. </p> <p>It is difficult to leave behind the claustrophobic parenting conventions of the land of the low grey cloud, but \"the Farm\" is an uninhibited, unruly and unfettered place. A place where kids can run about in packs unpoliced until dark.<br><strong>Richard Clements, Pagham, West Sussex</strong></p> <h2>2. Summer in Salcombe</h2> <p>A family holiday is an oxymoron. So is a British summer. Thus, with little expectation of either fine dining or the sun shining, we planned our break. With two small children, the boot was full, the journey short. We were going from Somerset to Devon.</p> <p>For the second year running we had booked into The Crab Pot, an ex-fisherman's hut situated on South Sands beach near the mouth of the estuary about a mile from Salcombe. The cottage has everything we could need: the presence of frighteningly high bunks for the courageous three-year-old and the absence of (frighteningly high) stairs for the outrageous one-year-old. The d\u00e9cor is \"spartan-chic\", having been recently redecorated. </p> <p>Like the children, our holiday world is small. Besides the cottage, where time is spent being amused by the children and the view, the week is played out in three places: the beach, the nearby National Trust property and Salcombe. </p> <p>The beach is only a few steps (seven, to be exact) from the cottage. It has plenty of yellow sand, which responds well to childish manipulation \u2014 which, frankly, is all that matters to half the family. The kids prefer the rock pools. We all like the locally produced ice-cream sold in the boat house.</p> <p>The National Trust property nearby is Overbeck's Museum &amp; Garden, situated a 15-minute toddle away. It supplies all necessary aspects of family activity: a garden for running races, a tearoom for filling faces, and a museum for hiding spaces (in this instance, a children's secret passage). And back to the beach, it's all downhill. Which is more than can be said for the journey to Salcombe, the third pillar of our holiday experience.</p> <p>Salcombe is reached via hills, which on foot require mountaineering gear, and by car require first gear. If you prefer, a ferry service runs half-hourly from South Sands to the centre of Salcombe (adults \u00a32.70). Salcombe is a picturesque town overlooking a beautiful estuary. It appears to be populated by models from a Boden catalogue. Luckily, they must have an appetite, which is well served by numerous caf\u00e9s and ice-cream parlours. We like the Wardroom, which overlooks the water. For more space, the Marine Hotel has a fantastic view \u2014 and fantastically few visitors in the afternoon.</p> <p>We're going back to the same cottage next year, trusting that with slightly larger children the journey will be easier, the boot emptier. It will be family; it might even be a holiday.<br><strong>Tessa Dean, Taunton</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The Crab Pot cottage: from \u00a3795 per week, <a href=\"http://www.thecrabpot.co.uk\">thecrabpot.co.uk</a>.</p> <h2>3. The Isle of Arran</h2> <p>\"The seafood shack is down the hill if you fancy some lunch; you can leave your kids with us if you want.\" Cracking langoustine, sipping white wine and looking out over the Kilbrannan Sound to the Isle of Arran, we used this rare childless window to reflect on how nice it was to go away with the kids. PGL, famous for their children's activity breaks, also run Family Active breaks where, instead of Parents Get Lost, it's Parents Go 'Long. The field studies research centre in Lochranza on the Isle of Arran is almost too good a secret to share. Open just for the month of August, accommodation is in basic family rooms with baths; cooked breakfasts, buffet lunches and three-course dinners that punctuate days filled with activities. <br> In seven short days we played golf, boarded a paddle steamer, went pony trekking, fished, watched a falconry display, dug through seaweed looking for starfish while seals basked on the rocks around us and cycled to Skipness \u2013 and we were taking the easy options. Others climbed mountains, abseiled, went gorge walking and we all met in the evenings for family entertainment. While this may sound like a hectic schedule, you do have the option to drop in and out of activities to suit, and there are always at least three to choose from. Our family of two adults, a seven-year-old and an 18-month-old was at the younger end of those there for the week, but that didn't seem to matter. The kids all played together and often organised games tournaments and hide and seek to fill their few spare moments. Arran is the seventh largest of Scotland's 790-plus islands. Reached by ferry from Cloanaig or Ardrossan, it is described as \"Scotland in miniature\" with its lochs, mountains and stunning coast. What we liked most about it was the peace, quiet and security it offered. Walking to the pier, we were passed by a red deer ambling down the road. Browsing the local paper, the headline Bike Not Stolen jumped out at us (a man had reported his bike stolen but found it two days later). Our seven-year-old particularly loved the freedom that a holiday in such a safe environment provided. After every meal, he would grunt like a teenager, \"Off to the games room, all right?\" And we would gather him up later, sweating Iron Brew after two hours of frenzied table tennis. At the end of the week, exhausted, we watched the Highland Games before starting the long drive home. What we hope our children will remember is not the foul tempers of frazzled parents but maybe watching Mum bounce in last in the space hopper race or playing golf and chipping a sweet shot over the river while Dad's ball plopped irretrievably into the waters beneath. Our son's adventure log (only half filled in \u2013 so little time) reads \"Day 3: Golf \u2013 I was better than Dad.\" At least we're building confidence.<br><strong>Clare Haines, Bristol</strong></p> <h2>4. Paris camp</h2> <p>Family holidays are sometimes an uneasy compromise. Parents want to spend their hard-earned holiday seeing interesting parts of the world while their offspring's priorities are probably a swimming pool and the company of other children. A bijou campsite at Versailles perhaps offers the solution.</p> <p>A short stroll from a train station, which takes you into central Paris in 25 minutes, Huttopia Versailles is a leafy campsite within easy reach of the chateau. With a number of sites throughout France and Canada, the Huttopia campsite chain bills itself as an alternative to those that offer \"mobile home suburbia\". Instead, they offer a small-scale developments of chalets and camping pitches in beautiful settings.</p> <p>We stayed in a wooden roulotte. Its exterior gave it the romantic appearance a gypsy caravan; inside it featured the layout and mod cons of a luxury mobile home.</p> <p>And so we set out to explore Paris and Versailles. When you have children in tow, you get a fresh angle on city tourism. It was strangely liberating \u2013 we didn't feel under pressure to tick off \"must-see\" monuments and museums. Instead, we cherry-picked fun sights that we thought would be fun \u2013 the Eiffel Tower featured, of course, and the monumental kaleidoscope that is Saint Chapelle with its walls of stained glass, and also the Conciergerie with its gory history of housing candidates for the guillotine. We enjoyed crepes while marvelling at the gargoyles outside Notre Dame without feeling the need to join the long queues waiting to shuffle around the interior. </p> <p>Paris has a wealth of children-focused attractions running each summer. There were gaudy fairground attractions in the Tuileries; the annual Paris Plage converts the banks of the Seine into a beachside resort; and if I ever return to the Jardin du Luxembourg as an old woman, I know I will joyfully recall the memory of seeing my children float hired toy sail boats in the pond.</p> <p>We couldn't avoid Disneyland Resort Paris. Though it provided a great day of consumerist fun, I found myself smugly pitying the folks who spend an entire holiday in the overgrown shopping mall atmosphere of the resort.</p> <p>Our July visit coincided with the spectacular Grandes Eaux Musicales at Versailles at which the extravagant excess of fountains in the chateau gardens are transformed into an enchanting theatrical production with music, lights, steam, smoke, fireworks\u2026 and, to the children's particular delight, millions of bubbles.</p> <p>But we weren't lacking in opportunities for rest and relaxation. While my husband and son (aged eight) caught the finale of the Tour de France, I lounged by the campsite pool enjoying my book, while my five-year-old daughter splashed about. Other days we did little more than graze on goodies we found at the market situated just beside the campsite. </p> <p>So, more attractive and cheaper than your average French campsite, with easy access to some of the world's greatest cultural treasures, and the opportunity to enjoy cheap French wine from our balcony, Huttopia felt like Utopia to us. <br> <br><strong>Jane Scott, Edinburgh</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.huttopia.com/\">huttopia.com</a> From \u20ac79 per night.</p> <h2>5. The Costa Blanca, Spain</h2> <p>\"Not hot sand again!\" wails Sadie, screwing up her face in horror. The prospect of a second day at the beach has turned her face hot with fury. Luckily, she is pacified with the promise of another \u20ac3 ice-cream. Ed has escaped for a leisurely swim out to X\u00e0bia's diving platform. The water is crystal clear and entices elderly Spanish ladies and beautiful bronzed toddlers with downy necks. After two days, I relax, though the endless application of factor 30 to wriggling bodies is starting to wear thin. The Costa Blanca, though unfashionable, has transformed us into a Boden family of brightly coloured clothes and brighter smiles. Friends nodded sympathetically when we revealed our destination, but while Rock and Suffolk are soaked with rain, we sit happily under a beach umbrella.<br> <br>Thursday brings a trip inland in search of the mysterious Fonts d'Algar. We drive though valleys swathed in vast veils that protect the region's citrus crop. It's a vision of the Spanish countryside as imagined by Cristo. As we park the car, tinny music and a man carrying a huge paella seem to suggest that a celebration is taking place at one of the local restaurants. The children walk hugging the sides of the street to find some much needed shade as the temperature rises to 35 degrees. The fonts are breathtaking: we climb up rickety walkways and steps that weave in between waterfalls and shady pools. It's a race to put on our swimming costumes but only Ed is brave enough to plunge into the icy mountain water, the rest of us paddle and picnic under ancient trees.</p> <p>Back at the apartment, we long for the cool of the evening. For Alice it is the first taste of adult freedom as she accompanies us to candle-lit beach bars. Although very much a resort, X\u00e0bia is refreshingly free of tacky karaoke bars and it is possible to find good tapas and Valencian paella. The children discover the rare treat of churros (fried doughnut sticks) and hot chocolate for breakfast, they stay up late and sleep in every morning as we all agree that the Spanish pace of life is so much more civilised.</p> <p>After a couple of days at the pool we investigate neighbouring D\u00e8nia to compare the quality of its beach. D\u00e8nia is pleasant enough but we feel satisfied that our own golden crescent of sand is superior. What really impresses is the journey through the rocky Serra del Montg\u00f3 which towers above our beach resort. Montg\u00f3 stands at 753 metres and is said to resemble an elephant (if you happen to be looking at it in exactly the right way). On a clear day, you can see across the water to Ibiza, 100km away. It's hazy so we can't see the white isle, but the girls are amused by the sight of hardy cyclists attempting the tortuous climb. When it's time to leave, we wave goodbye with regret, making heartfelt promises to return.<br><strong>Melanie Seddon</strong></p>",
  "<p>The MDC's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/27/zimbabwe\">booing and jeering</a> of Robert Mugabe as he gave his opening address at parliament was ill-advised. Sure, it will have delighted the western media, but it made the MDC look like boozers' league rejects, rather than a supposed government-in-waiting.</p> <p>It could be argued that Mugabe has earned the right to his public barracking. But, as we watched the MDC performance, one thought ran through every Zimbabwean's mind; if this is how they behave now, what would they be like in power? Certainly, Mugabe was humiliated, but so too was the new speaker of the house of assembly, the MDC's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/zimbabwe\">Lovemore Moyo</a>, whose fundamental task is to preserve the dignity of parliament, and create an enabling environment for serious discussion.</p> <p>Tuesday's noise factory could have consequences. First, it will give plentiful ammunition to Zanu-PF hardliners. They have been insisting that Mugabe must retain executive power in any deal with the opposition MDC. Now they will be saying that the MDC is an immature opposition, and will pressure Mugabe to form a cabinet as quickly as possible. Second, it will give the hard men another excuse to crack down, and unleash the eager, voracious predators from within the war veterans, Central Intelligence Organisation, police and army. There will likely be a new wave of arrests and beatings as they try to avenge their humiliation, and prevent MDC MPs from taking their seats, particularly when there is debate over major legislation. Third, it will make the speaker's job that much harder. Zanu-PF will not believe that Moyo was not part of the heckling, and he will have a real task on his hands to maintain order in the house when parliament reconvenes in October.</p> <p>This parliament could be the most important since <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/12/98/zimbabwe/226542.stm\">independence</a>. The combination of the MDC's slight majority in the lower house and ownership of the speaker's chair, means that should Mugabe fully <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/27/zimbabwe1\">form a cabinet</a>, it will not be done with parliamentary approval, and it will be impossible for Zanu-PF, and President Mbeki, to \"sell\" any new cabinet as the legitimate representatives of the Zimbabwean people.</p> <p>But Zanu-PF will fire all manner of legal salvoes in its determination to retain legitimacy; and for the state, the much-abused constitution is always the heavy artillery. According to the constitution, 180 days is the maximum period allowed between official sittings of parliament \u2013 hence the reopening of parliament. Furthermore, once parliament is in session, a cabinet must be formed as soon as possible. Zanu-PF also insists that the <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200807230758.html\">memorandum of understanding</a>, which explicitly forbids the reconvening of parliament and the appointment of a new cabinet without the approval of all the negotiatory parties, is not a binding contract. The legal tussles between the parties will run and run. However, the perennial questions about MDC strategy remain: for them to petition Mbeki on the illegality of the current parliament, whilst participating in that same parliament, is nonsensical. You cannot have your <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadza\">sadza</a> and eat it. If they are really opposed to this sitting of parliament, then they should have boycotted the proceedings entirely.</p> <p>The real significance of this parliament is that it could revive the meaning of that institution. It usually rubber-stamps ruling-party legislation, but Zimbabwe's parliament is far from being a broken institution. Even post-2000, there have been serious legislative debates. The expectation is that, at the very least, the new parliament will provide a forum for robust debate, and reintroduce the principle of executive accountability. Having a speaker in the lower house will empower the MDC there; the senate president is from Zanu-PF, and it will dominate the upper house. So, there will likely be a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/zimbabwe.africanunion\">zero-sum game in parliament</a>, as each side tries to block the other. The great danger for the MDC is that it will be tempted to block everything. This would backfire, because Zanu-PF would retaliate in kind. The MDC must grasp, and quickly, that this is its chance to show that it is serious. If it wants to be seen as credible, then it must oppose the seductions of a perennial \"no\". Sometimes, it will need to flirt with \"yes\".</p> <p>Ultimately, the two sides will have to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/17/zimbabwe\">work together</a>. The constitution has been used and abused by Zanu-PF, and there have been highly repressive amendments and new bills passed. The opposition should scrutinise all legislation, but it should never forget its duty of care to the Zimbabwean people. Not all the legislation passed in parliament has been villainous, and whilst the MDC should oppose repressive legislation, it should work with Zanu-PF to pass constructive bills. The public finance management bill, the energy laws amendment bill, the older persons bill, the education bill; and the construction industry council bill, all of which are to be tabled in the new parliament, are actually of sound intent. These may be bills on which all sides can do business. The <a href=\"http://kubatana.net/html/archive/legisl/070925ieebamd.asp?sector=LEGISL&amp;year=0&amp;range_start=1\">national indigenisation and empowerment bill</a>, on the other hand, will be highly contentious. The ministerial budgets will become major battlegrounds, as will the constitution itself.</p> <p>There's the possibility that Mugabe may close parliament and rule by decree. Assuming that parliament does remain open for business, the danger is that it will become nihilistic, with no cooperation at all between the parties, and even the good legislation being buried along with the bad. If the political antagonists are mature, they will not allow the stalled political negotiations to contaminate parliament; indeed it is all the more imperative that parliament functions. The battles for power between and within Zanu-PF, and the two MDCs (and possible breakaway groups) will continue.</p> <p>There will be all kinds of political horse-trading, making and breaking of deals, and crossing the floor, in this session of parliament. That is to be expected; but millions of suffering Zimbabweans also expect results, and apart from being an arena of political jousting, parliament should now enable constructive legislation which benefits ordinary Zimbabweans. The MDC needs to drop its \"Parliament is illegal \u2013 we want no part of it\" whinging and get on with the job of delivering the constructive change they have promised. Zanu-PF also has to realise that the days of a rubber-stamp parliament and getting legislation passed through the back-door are over.</p>",
  "<p>Was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/aug/30/alistairdarling.economy\">Alistair Darling's frankness in his Guardian interview</a> a breath of frank fresh air, finally chiming with the expletive frustration of the everyday voter? Or was it the political cardinal sin of talking down the economy, kicking over any last vestige of confidence the markets may have had?<br> On the one hand, it is a relief to see Darling finally let the cat out of the bag and talk straight in an assessment of the economy that echoes some of the concern - and sometimes some of the language - out on the streets of constituencies such as Bristol North West up and down the country. Just what Labour needs, you might think. </p> <p>As I have argued before, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2008/jun/09/giveittousstraight\">people like to be treated as adults and get no comfort from politicians mechanically choking out the same automated voice announcements</a> - \"Britain is well-placed to meet this global economic downturn\" - when they know very well, as the OECD reported earlier this year, that we are uniquely vulnerable to the global economic downturn thanks to Gordon's uncharacteristically carefree attitude when it came to spending and borrowing during the sunny days.<br> On the other, simple <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=nTr6oLFHnK0\">doom-mongering</a>, which simply damages confidence in the economy further, can only make the economic picture worse. Cardinal sin to deflate confidence when it so needs to be boosted! Darling should know that, surely? So what on earth was going on?<br> Maybe if Darling thought that the automated economic announcements had actually contributed any confidence in the economy, such frankness wouldn't have been necessary. And as it happens, I 'm not sure his candid gloom - Private Frazer's \"We're all doomed\" - is very much less reassuring that the automated economic announcements - behind which, if you listen, you can hear the entire Labour government running around screaming \"<a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR6wok7g7do\">Don't panic, don't panic, Mr Mainwaring!</a>\"<br> But certainly the discrepancy in opinions between the chancellor and his leader do not inspire confidence. And there is always a healthy middle ground. The governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, often attains this quite well - a realistic assessment with a sturdy, forward-looking and challenging response. That's all people want from their leaders. The next Conservative government is going to have a tricky inheritance - particularly with Brown announcing this week that he is now out to buy electoral popularity on a credit card for which the Cameron government will probably have to foot the bill. But the real way to deal with tough times and inspire confidence is not to squeal and carry on borrowing and spending. It's through honesty, informed optimism and inspiring leadership. Between them, Brown and Darling have failed on all three counts. Reading the Darling interview, it struck me that it is often easy to sit back and criticise what seems like another's madness. If one lesson for politicians and aspiring politicians such as me emerges from all this, it's beware too much \"holiday perspective\". Holidays are essential. A healthy politics\u2013life balance is necessary, and maintaining perspective makes for better policy. But it's a balance. Had the Darling interview taken place in the cloisters of Westminster, where the revolution of politics has its own gravitational pull, and not in the remote highlands of Scotland with eagles soaring overhead, it is almost certain that Brown would have been spared this embarrassing week and Darling's blunt words. As the political machine begins to whirr up again in time for conference season, Brown might even be breathing a sigh of relief that more of his parliamentary colleagues didn't suffer from an overexuberant irreverence while feeling liberated on holiday. Ironic that the blow to kill Brown's relaunch next week should have come not from the simmering Blairites, but from one of the prime minister's only true friends in the cabinet. If we didn't now know Darling better, we could almost have thought it was another leadership bid. </p>",

  "<p>Shock horror. Politician tells it the way it is. Sterling tumbles to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/01/economy.alistairdarling\">12-year-low</a> against the euro after chancellor of the exchequer says that life is tough out there. Share prices fall because Alistair Darling says that voters are \"pissed off\" with the government. To paraphrase <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Fawlty\">Basil Fawlty</a>, all this is surely a statement of the bleedin' obvious.</p> <p>The problem here is not <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/01/currencies.economicgrowth\">what Darling said</a>, it's that our political culture militates against honesty. The cardinal sin for any politician is to commit a gaffe and it is considered a major gaffe for the chancellor to say that the difficulties for the economy are going to be more profound and last longer than people thought. Yet, this is hardly earth-shattering stuff. The International Monetary Fund has said the financial crisis is the worst since the 1930s. The deputy governor of the Bank of England, Charles Bean, told a conference in America last week that Britain was facing conditions just as challenging as those in the 1970s. House prices are falling, food bills are rising and it costs more to fill the car up with petrol than it did a year ago. So, self-evidently, the economy is not doing well. And, just as obviously, the downturn in the economy is taking its toll of support for the government.</p> <p>In part, that's inevitable. All governments suffer when the economic skies darken, and if the government has been in power for a long time the political cost of recession tends to be amplified by boredom.</p> <p>There is, though, more to it than that. Labour \u2013 and Gordon Brown in particular \u2013 have talked up the economy so much over the past decade that the government is now hideously exposed to the oncoming recession. Brown, who boasted frequently about how boom and bust was now history has spent the past year blaming all Britain's problems on global forces, while insisting that the country is well placed to weather the storm. As a political strategy, this has clearly been a total flop. Voters are not entirely stupid: they can sense that the economy has been kept going these past few years by the twin bubbles in the housing market and the City of London, and that both those bubbles have now popped.</p> <p>Darling has been pilloried for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/poll/2008/sep/01/alistairdarling.marketturmoil\">his candour</a>. Chancellors, according to the rules of the political game, are not supposed to say anything that might disturb the voters or scare the markets. They are supposed to answer questions with bland reassurance even if it means swearing blind that white is black and black is white. Yet, if things are so wonderful, why is the government planning to unveil a plan tomorrow to help prevent families from being thrown out of their home as a result of the credit crunch and the housing crash? Darling's words are at least consistent with Labour's actions. What's more, he has the decency to treat voters as grown-ups rather than as total idiots who can be gulled with a bit of political spin into believing that things are not as bad as they are.</p>",
  "<p>Investors today delivered a raspberry to Commerzbank's \u20ac9.8bn (\u00a37.955bn) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/01/banking.germany\">takeover of troubled German rival Dresdner</a>, sending its shares down 8.5% in morning trading.</p> <p>Martin Blessing, who will head Germany's second-biggest bank when the deal is complete in late 2009, insisted that the takeover would generate higher profits and held out the prospect of further acquisitions.</p> <p>But investors were unconvinced that the deal would deliver the promised \u20ac5bn in cost-savings by 2012 via 9000 job-cuts or that it would proceed as smoothly as executives suggested.</p> <p>It emerged at a news conference in Frankfurt that 70% of the job losses would occur in investment banking where restructuring costs, including generous payoffs, would cost around \u20ac900m. Only 10% will take place in retail banking.</p> <p>Blessing and Michael Diekmann, chief executive of insurer Allianz which has owned Dresdner for the past seven years, confirmed that around half of the 2,500 job losses outside Germany would be at Dresdner Kleinwort, the City-based investment bank that is to be drastically shrunk.</p> <p>Blessing, who said the deal would cost a net \u20ac8.8bn, hailed it as \"a unique opportunity for the German banking sector to become more competitive globally\" and would create higher earnings from 2011. The two-stage deal would produce a return on equity of at least 15%.</p> <p>He indicated that the new Commerzbank would secure future growth partly through acquisitions but refused to be drawn on any bid for Postbank, which Deutsche Post wants to offload in Germany's over-crowded retail banking market.</p> <p>The combined bank will eventually see the current 1,540 branches cut to 1,200, serving more than 11 million private customers in Germany. Blessing said more would be added: \"That's our goal; we want to grow.\"</p> <p>Diekmann, who will become deputy chairman, said the deal was urgently required in the current global financial crisis and would deliver greater stability to Germany's and Europe's banking sector.</p> <p>Allianz, which will acquire Commerzbank's asset management business Cominvest for \u20ac700m as part of the deal, will be the biggest shareholder in the combined bank with just under 30%. Generali, the Italian insurer that owns 8.8% of Commerz, indicated it would retain its holding.</p> <p>Allianz, which saw its shares drop around 1%, will gain exclusive access to Commerz customers for its insurance products and Diekmann said the deal would strengthen its position in bancassurance.</p> <p>Several German analysts questioned the wisdom of the deal, including the price, but others welcomed it. Citigroup analysts said: \"We think the key swing factor will be whether management can reduce the investment bank costs and assets as planned without unexpected obstacles or charges. If they can, they will have bought a powerful German retail/corporate franchise at an attractive price\"</p>",
  "<p>The vast Greenland ice sheet could begin to melt more rapidly than expected towards the end of the century, accelerating the rise in sea levels as a result of global warming, scientists warned yesterday.</p> <p>Water running off the ice sheet could triple the current rate of sea level rise to around 9mm a year, leading to a global rise of almost 1 metre per century, the researchers found.</p> <p>Sea levels are already on the rise as a result of increasing temperatures, because the oceans expand as they warm up, but until now scientists have had a poor understanding of how quickly ice sheets such as those in Greenland and Antarctica will begin to disappear.</p> <p>There are signs that the Greenland ice sheet, which covers 1.7 million square kilometres of land, has already begun to melt faster than expected. The reason is thought to be surface water on the ice sheet trickling down through fissures to the underlying bedrock, making the ice sheet less stable, and the loss of buttressing ice shelves along the coastline.</p> <p>Climate scientists are uncertain how susceptible ice sheets are to global warming, largely because they have never witnessed one disappear, so researchers led by Anders Carlson at the University of Wisconsin-Madison decided to look back to the end of the last ice age for clues.</p> <p>Around 20,000 years ago, when the last ice age was at its peak, a giant mass of frozen water called the Laurentide ice sheet covered much of what is now North America. The ice sheet, which was three miles thick in some places, had almost completely melted 6,500 years ago as the world warmed as part of its natural cycle. At the time, surface air temperatures were similar to those that climate scientists predict for 2100.</p> <p>The researchers used evidence in the geological record and computer simulations to reconstruct the demise of the Laurentide ice sheet, which was the last ice sheet to completely disappear in the northern hemisphere. </p> <p>They dated boulders and fossilised organisms left on fresh ground as the ice sheet retreated, and found that it went through two periods of rapid melting. Computer simulations revealed that around 9,000 years ago, water melting off the ice sheet caused sea levels to rise by about 7 metres at a rate of around 1.3cm a year. The second stage of rapid melting began 7,500 years ago, when sea levels rose by 5 metres at a rate of around 0.7cm a year.</p> <p>The reconstruction suggests that the Greenland ice sheet may melt in a similar fashion. \"We have never seen an ice sheet retreat significantly or even disappear before, yet this may happen for the Greenland ice sheet in the coming centuries to millenia,\" said Carlson, whose study appears in the journal Nature Geoscience.</p> <p>\"We're not talking about something catastrophic, but we could see a much bigger response in terms of sea level from the Greenland ice sheet over the next 100 years than what is currently predicted,\" Carlson added.</p> <p>The most recent report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that sea levels will have risen by around 10cm at most by 2100, but according to Carlson's analysis, rapid melting of the Greenland ice sheet could cause much greater rises. </p> <p>\"For planning purposes, we should see the IPCC projections as conservative,\" he said. \"We think this is a very low estimate of what the Greenland ice sheet will contribute to sea level.\"</p> <p>In an accompanying article, Mark Sidall at Bristol University describes how a 1 metre rise in sea level would submerge an estimated 2.2m square kilometres of land, largely in Asia, and displace around 145 million people at a global cost of $944 billion.</p> <p>He points out, though, that while the Laurentide ice sheet completely vanished at the end of the last ice age, the Greenland ice sheet remains, suggesting it is more resistant to warming. \"To what extent this dynamic response of the Laurentide ice sheet to past temperature change can be considered analagous to present and future reduction of the Greenland ice sheet remains unresolved,\" he writes. \"But [the researchers'] work suggests that future reductions of the Greenland ice sheet on the order of 1 metre per century are not out of the question.\"</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps by now, in this long election season, we should have learned to expect the unexpected. After all, an \"inevitable\" Democratic nominee has already lost out to a young African-American senator from Illinois. But when John McCain picked the virtually unknown Alaska governor Sarah Palin - literally unknown to 51% of Americans, according to a new poll - astonishment was still the dominant reaction. The astonishment had barely begun to subside when a second shock followed. In response to the imminent arrival of Hurricane Gustav on the gulf coast, the Republican convention was drastically scaled back: all today's political speeches have been cancelled. </p> <p>Whatever the motive, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the debacle could have some upsides for the Republicans. Since George Bush and Dick Cheney will be staying away, the party has avoided the biggest potential headache of the convention. And the weekend visit of McCain and Palin to assess Mississippi's disaster preparedness - an outing of questionable utility, surely, to Mississippi - could boost their image as non-partisan, responsive leaders.

  "<p>Despite the deep rift between many sections of the worldwide Muslim and Jewish communities, the two religions share a great deal, in terms of their joint heritage and approach to making the world a better place. The arena of altruism is a good example of the common ground between adherents of both faiths, with Jew and Muslim alike required to apportion significant amounts of their incomes to charitable causes. </p> <p>Jews are bound to <a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/tzedakah.htm\">donate</a> 10% of their earnings to help those less fortunate than themselves, whilst Muslims are compelled to give under a similar framework (<a href=\"http://www.brevardmasjid.com/zakat/index.html\">zakat</a>). With this in mind, a group of British Jews and Muslims have formed a joint venture, the Jerusalem interest-free microfinance fund (<a href=\"http://www.jerusalemmicrofinance.com\">JIMF</a>), with the intention of freeing both Jewish and Arab residents of the holy city from the shackles of poverty. </p> <p>On top of the immediate benefits to the recipients of the fund's no-interest loans, JIMF's trustees hope to make an impact on a larger scale in terms of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Those who receive JIMF's assistance will, it is hoped, be brought together by their common need, and \"realise that their common interests, such as feeding their families, are greater than the things that divide them\", according to trustee Michael Pollak. </p> <p>Loans of between $5,000 and $10,000 will be granted to suitable candidates, who are expected to come in the main from orthodox Jewish and Muslim communities; sectors of society prevented by religious law from entering into interest-paying contracts. The project is the brainchild of Pollak and his partner Donald Franklin, a British-Jewish academic who has been involved in cross-communal initiatives in the UK for several years. </p> <p>Another trustee is Liberal Democrat councillor <a href=\"http://fiyazmughal.org.uk/\">Fiyaz Mughal</a>, who spoke of his delight at the project's successful establishment. \"The fund is a really good idea, especially in an area which is usually portrayed in a very negative way\", he said. He pointed out that the fund will do its best to avoid granting loans in contentious circumstances where possible, such as supporting the creation of Jewish businesses in disputed areas across the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_(Israel)\">Green Line</a>. </p> <p>JIMF are taking this approach for pragmatic reasons as well as political, so as to avoid upsetting the sensibilities of potential donors. \"Muslims in the UK are not averse to helping Jews in general\", said Mughal, \"but it is more about which specific areas the money is going to\". He said that British Muslims are aware that \"they have to move beyond just supporting Arab communities\", and that there was a realisation that JIMF's work was a much-needed countering of the sectarian divisiveness so prevalent in the region. </p> <p>However, to date the only money raised has come from the Jewish community, who have contributed around $200,000 to the cause. Mughal hopes that Muslim donors will soon appear on the scene, but admitted that it could be \"a one to two year\" timescale on that front. At the same time, despite having raised a significant amount from British Jewry, Pollak remarked that there had been some heated opposition to the fund's work from within Jewish circles. </p> <p>\"People get very proprietorial when it comes to Israel\", he said. \"They think that it's 'our' money going to 'them', when they hear that we will be supporting Arab citizens in need\". He remains undeterred by the abuse, however, and strongly believes that JIMF's work will be to the benefit of all residents of the region. \"By helping these people start their own businesses and stand on their own two feet, we will help draw them into the democratic process\", he said. </p> <p>\"Once people own a stake in the economy, and once their businesses are up and running, they will have an interest in the stability of the country\", he explained, \"and be less likely to [become extremists]\". He hopes that those assisted by the fund will eventually come into contact with their fellow recipients from the other side of the societal divide, via joint training days run by JIMF to teach them the requisite skills to manage their own companies. </p> <p>JIMF has the ability to provide scores of families with a way out of poverty, and in a city with a large percentage of the population living below the poverty line, there will be no end of suitable contenders for their assistance. However, at the other end of the spectrum, there is the potential to encourage less insularity on the part of both Muslim and Jewish philanthropists. For all that charity is said to begin at home, such an approach does nothing to promote cross-communal awareness, nor build bridges between the two camps.</p> <p>That the likes of Pollak, Mughal, and their fellow trustees, are committed to causes beyond their immediate communities is a shot in the arm for anyone looking for a glimmer of hope in this troubled region. In the upper echelons of Israeli and Palestinian politics, stalemate is the order of the day, and has been for years. Down at street level, on the other hand, at least there are some pockets of resistance to the deadlock that has paralysed the two peoples for so long.</p>",

One hundred months from that date the risk of triggering runaway climate change goes, in effect, from amber to red.</p> <p>Now, 31 days later, we have 99 months to turn the tide. The time for excuses and evasions is over. We are entering, as Winston Churchill said in 1936, \"a period of consequences\". To help focus minds and catalyse action, we also launched a website: <a href=\"http://www.onehundredmonths.org\">www.onehundredmonths.org</a>. </p> <p>The response to both the article and site was immense. Two Nobel Prize winners, many churches and countless other groups rushed to endorse the initiative. Over 135,000 people from 130 countries signed up on the website to take actions, or were asked to do so by friends.</p> <p>So what happens now? Each month we will be promoting an action that will pave the way for the swiftest transition possible. But we won't come up with them all on our own. </p> <p>So, we want your suggestions: simple ones, bold ones, crazy but good ones - things that we can push for at all these levels - add them in the comments below. We'll keep a record of all your ideas. We'll highlight the best ones and the very best ones will be campaigned for by the OneHundredMonths initiative. </p> <p>How bold can we be in what we hope to achieve? Across the ocean, Al Gore has just challenged the whole of the United States to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/17/algore.energyefficiency\">unplug its oil and coal</a> dialysis machine. He wants the nation to become powered entirely by renewable energy within 10 years. Recent findings from the <a href=\"http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/\">Tyndall Centre </a>suggest that for the UK to play its part in an effective global deal, from 2012 we'll need to cut our emissions by up to 9% year after year for decades to come. So think big.</p> <p>But as a start, month 99 begins on our own doorsteps, putting our own homes in order. We can't tell people to stop smoking, if cigarettes are hanging from our mouths. We'll begin by taking our money away from the problem - the providers of dirty and dangerous fossil fuel energy, and putting it into the pockets of those providing the solution - clean and safe renewable energy.</p> <p>Lastly, in the messages we have had from people, there has been one big, unexpected, positive consequence. You worry that a challenge on this scale leaves people paralysed with worry and helplessness. But, in place of that, has been the realisation that now everything we do has meaning and matters. </p> <p>We need to make every month count.

  "<p>Youth violence is rarely out of the headlines at present. A stabbing last weekend brought the stabbing death toll in London alone to 50 this year. As exam results are published, including SATs results showing that 114,000 pupils are joining secondary school without basic literacy and fewer pupils are taking GCSEs, what does this mean for children's behaviour and youth violence? And what can schools do to combat this?</p> <p>In our current school system children are explicitly taught how to read and write in the early years. After that a certain level of literacy is taken for granted as we rush them through the prescribed curriculum, heading quickly towards the golden GCSE As to Cs and hoping for better league table results.</p> <p>This focus on exam results can leave a significant number of \"hopeless\" cases left behind. As the recent SATs result show, almost a fifth of students leave primary school without basic literacy. Allowing this number of children to slip through the net can have a detrimental effect on their behaviour in adolescence and through into adulthood.</p> <p>Youth crime has been strongly linked to illiteracy and truancy. Government figures for 2002 \u2013 2003 show 40% of young offenders entering prison were below level 1 (i.e. would not achieve a G at GCSE English). This is also true of adult offenders, with 80% having the writing skills of an 11 year old.</p> <p>This is not the only factor. There are often deeper language and communication difficulties which drastically limit an offender's ability to respond in emotionally laden situations, making it more likely that they will lash out and be violent.</p> <p>These individuals are also likely to have been the victims of abuse of violence themselves. For some children a group of their peers may provide more care and protection than can be found at home or school. For them it may be a rational choice to join a gang rather than be left out of one.</p> <p>The seminal report on schools, Fifteen Hundred Hours, found that while schools have the ability to establish an ethos that governs the behaviour of students in school that influence is not likely to stretch outside the school buildings. That helps us to understand how schools can be havens of calm in neighbourhoods that otherwise experience high levels of crime violence and delinquency.</p> <p>Maintaining this safe environment is fundamental. To ensure that routine and regulation remain, it is vital that school staff maintain strong leadership and a united front. Areas that need to be regulated most are the borders of schools, e.g. the school gate, or areas which are at times unpopulated; these are the boundaries which pupils may test. A simple way for schools to guarantee student safety is by meeting pupils at the gate and ensuring corridors are managed properly.</p> <p>While maintaining safety, schools need to implement teaching methods and a curriculum that will help the most disadvantaged pupils. Many schools are trying new ways of working with young people, such as providing an integrated curriculum at Year 7, allowing younger students to work in a topic based manner with a smaller number of teachers. As well as being more similar to the environment the students have been used to at primary school, it allows teaching staff to keep a closer eye on issues such as literacy and communication skills. Schools are also introducing the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) initiative that re-introduces many of the human relations and expressive practices, such as circle time, that were such an important aspect of secondary education before the introduction of the national curriculum.</p> <p>Perhaps most important of all is a shift to teaching styles that takes account of the poor literacy skills of many of our pupils. Most secondary curriculum design and textbook production is based on an assumption that the students have a reading age of nine years old or higher \u2013 roughly corresponding to the technical level of most tabloid newspapers. Yet many secondary teachers recognise that they have large numbers of children in their classrooms with reading ages below that. To work effectively with these young people we have to adopt a teaching methods that allow for much more talk in classrooms and give a heavy emphasis to decoding and understanding key words. In short, we need to use much more primary teaching technique in the secondary classroom.</p> <p>However, if we cannot escape the mindless tyranny of the league tables we will continue to sideline the young people who appear later in the headlines.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Bayley is appearing in Teaching with Bayley - Power to the pupils on Teachers TV at 5.30pm on Thursday September 4.

  "<p>Britain's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/manufacturingdata\">manufacturing sector</a> contracted for the fourth month in a row in August while inflationary pressures picked up, adding to signs that the economy is heading towards a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economicgrowth\">recession</a>.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply/Markit's monthly index measuring manufacturing activity hit 45.9 last month - below the 50 point that marks the cut-off between contraction and expansion. Although this is a slight improvement on July's downwardly revised 44.1, economists warned that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/manufacturing\">UK manufacturing sector</a> is still deteriorating.</p> <p>\"The downturn in manufacturing continued into August, as a lacklustre domestic market and high inflationary pressures eroded confidence at businesses and households alike,\" said Rob Dobson, an economist at Markit. \"These factors weighed heavily on order books, while the ensuing global economic slowdown meant there was no support from the external sector.\"</p> <p>Businesses' output was bolstered by work on old orders, rather than new business, with backlogs of work falling to a new series low. While the output index rose to 48.7 from 43.2 - still indicating contraction - the export orders measure stood at 46.4, little changed from July's six and a half-year low of 46.3.</p> <p>Companies passed on higher raw material costs to their customers, pushing up the output prices index to 64.5, a fresh record high. This adds to the Bank of England's dilemma in setting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">interest rates</a>. It is expected to keep rates unchanged at 5% this Thursday. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/12/inflation.creditcrunch\">Consumer price inflation has hit 4.4%</a>, way above the Bank's 2% target.</p> <p>\"While ongoing weak manufacturing activity in August heightens belief that the UK economy will contract in the third quarter and is well on its way into recession, the still rising prices charged index highlights the fact that there are still serious inflation risks that make it difficult for the Bank of England to cut interest rates in the near term,\" said Howard Archer at Global Insight.</p> <p>Manufacturers also laid off more workers last month, with the employment measure at 43.8, the second-lowest reading since late 2001.</p>",
  "<p>The number of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages\">mortgages</a> approved for house purchases fell to a record low in July and is down 71% on the same period last year, figures showed today.</p> <p>The Bank of England said 33,000 home loans were approved for purchases during the month, down from 35,000 in June and markedly below the previous six-month average of 55,000.</p> <p>This is the lowest level of purchase approvals recorded since comparable records began 25 years ago.</p> <p>The value of mortgages taken out to fund <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/property\">property</a> purchases plummeted over the three months to July, from \u00a37.5bn in April to just \u00a34.3bn.</p> <p>The number of remortgages also dropped from 80,000 in June to 69,000 in July. This figure is also below the previous six-month average of 96,000.</p> <p>According to the Bank's figures, a total of \u00a33.2bn of loans secured on properties was advanced during the month, slightly more than June's figure of \u00a33.1bn but still well below the \u00a39.3bn advanced in July 2007.</p> <p>Separate figures from the Building Societies Association (BSA) show the number of loans approved by societies reaching a new low in July.</p> <p>Building societies approved \u00a32.5bn worth of new mortgages over the month, compared with \u00a33.9bn in July 2007.</p> <p>While gross lending by societies totalled \u00a33.3bn, when repayments and mortgage redemptions were taken into account lending was -\u00a379m, compared with \u00a3506m last July.</p> <p>The BSA's director general, Adrian Coles, said both buyers and lenders were approaching the housing market with caution. </p> <p>\"Recent falls in house prices have been widely publicised, reducing potential buyers' confidence and keeping them out of the market,\" he said.</p> <p>\"And with societies seeking to maintain high quality loan books, societies have chosen to follow a policy of conservative lending that has further reduced the amount of mortgage business they have undertaken.\" </p> <h2>Ailing property market</h2> <p>The number of approvals for house purchases has been falling for 12 months, driven by a lack of availability of mortgages resulting from the credit crunch and buyers' concerns over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">house prices</a>.</p> <p>This morning, property company Hometrack said prices had fallen by 0.9% in August, and the further fall in demand for mortgages is likely to filter through to lower prices over the next few months.</p> <p>The Bank's figures give weight to calls for the government to step in to help the property market.</p> <p>This morning the Royal Insititution of Chartered Surveyors urged the government to take action to provide more funds to lenders and encourage more buyers into the market.</p> <p>Gordon Brown is expected to announce a package of measures to help homeowners and buyers later this week. </p> <p>However, Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, warned there may be little the government can do to prop up the market. </p> <p>\"We suspect that whatever measures the government announces to try to help the housing market, it will only have a very limited impact in stabilising the sector, particularly given current very negative housing market sentiment, likely extended weak economic activity, and rising unemployment,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Howl farewell to the dog days of August. They were mostly damp and drab, not to mention marking the beginning of a 100-month countdown to the world entering a new, more perilous phase of global warming. Not everything, though, can be blamed directly on climate change. For the record, weather varies enormously due to short-term atmospheric changes. The climate system, however, changes in response to the complex push and pull of many spheres, from solar radiation to ice cover and greenhouse gas levels. Weather is a subset of climate, whose long-term patterns will nevertheless change as the climate system alters.</p> <p>One month ago, writing in the Guardian, we said that the world had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/01/climatechange.carbonemissions\">100 months to go</a> before it stood to cross a threshold, after which we will all be playing a game of climate roulette. Runaway global warming is the bullet in the chamber. With all the work and words expended on the issue, still, we thought, a reality check was needed. Unlike other issues demanding a political solution, climate change is on a ticking clock. We either do, or we don't, avert runaway warming.</p> <p>The response to pointing this out was astonishing.</p> <p>In just the first three weeks, via <a href=\"http://www.onehundredmonths.org/\">the website</a>, more than 135,000 people from more than 130 countries signed either themselves up to take regular monthly actions on climate change, or were directly asked to do so by friends. One man in New Zealand printed out the Guardian article and posted it to all 121 members of his national parliament. Rap star P Diddy reportedly grounded his airplane, although, just possibly, this might have had something more to do with the cost of fuel.</p> <p>Many worried that in drawing attention to such a stark reality, the consequence would be a disabling sense of powerlessness. If you see someone crossing the road in front of a runaway truck, the balance has to be struck between shouting so loud that they freeze in their tracks, and closing your eyes to pretend it's not happening. Al Gore's team in the US has struggled with it. One of his campaign psychological advisors (this is the US, remember, they have such things) got in touch to say that the One Hundred Months initiative was just right, in terms of facing the inconvenient truth and leaving people with a sense that they can act to make every month count.</p> <p>The countdown also came to the attention of the world's most important figure on climate change, the Nobel Prize-winning chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, <a href=\"http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/ipcc-lecture_en.html\">R K Pachauri</a>. He wrote to us commenting that: \"It speaks highly of the effectiveness of this effort that so many people have signed themselves up for regular monthly campaigns over the next 100 months. This is most heartening, and it is efforts such as these that can make a difference to stabilize the earth's climate and in moving human society on the path of sustainable development.\"</p> <p>From the <a href=\"http://www.thewi.org.uk/\">Women's Institute</a> in the UK, to the Green Belt movement in Kenya (led by <a href=\"http://www.greenbeltmovement.org/w.php?id=3\">Wangari Maathai</a>, another Nobel Prize winner), groups have been signing up to push for accelerated action over the next 100 months.</p> <p>New research from the <a href=\"http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/\">Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research</a> at Manchester University added extra urgency in the last month. Targets for tackling global warming often leave out vital greenhouse gas emissions, such as those stemming from international transport and the environmental domino effects referred to by scientists as \"carbon cycle feedbacks\". Tyndall's research director, Kevin Anderson, concludes that when these things are taken into account, the UK's emissions must peak by the year 2012 and then decline by at least 6 to 9 per cent annually. It is misleading to talk, as the government does, about long-term targets for the year 2050, because what matters is how greenhouse gases accumulate on a yearly basis. Our only option, he says, it to \"radically and urgently curtail ... demand for energy\".</p> <p>The howling question then, with which to leave the British summer behind, is how to provide security to people in fuel poverty, and pay for the rapid transition to a low carbon economy?</p> <p>Step forward the suddenly popular <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree+politics/taxandspending\">windfall tax</a>. In October 2006, we proposed a recurrent additional tax on UK fossil fuel companies to pay into what we called an Oil Legacy Fund. It was to follow the fantastically successful Norwegian example which, over years, built up a financial safety net for future generations that was worth, at the last count, around 260bn euros (\u00a3198bn), or 75,000 euros (\u00a357,000) for every man, woman and child in the country.</p> <p>Revived by a combination of MPs, the regulator Ofgem and Labour activists in the Compass group, a powerful case is now being made in the face of high oil prices and Labour's current political difficulties.</p> <p>Just three companies \u2013 BP, Centrica and Shell \u2013 together made \u00a31,000 profit per second over the first six months of 2008. At the same time, every second, mankind overall is emitting 1,000 tonnes of CO2. As the climate clock keeps ticking, possibly the most important challenge is to end a system that allows vast profits to be made at the cost of undermining the climatic foundations of civilisation. A recurrent windfall tax would do that.</p> <p>As Winston Churchill said in parliament in November 1936, \"The era of procrastination, of half measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. In its place, we are entering a period of consequences ... I never would have believed that we should have been allowed to go on getting into this plight, month by month ...\"</p> <p>On the climate clock, it is now 99 months, and counting.</p> <p><em>To be part of the solution go to <a href=\"http://onehundredmonths.org/\">www.onehundredmonths.org</a> \u2013 and tell your friends.</em></p>",
  "<p>Artificial clouds to reflect away sunlight, creating colossal blooms of oceanic algae and the global use of synthetic carbon-neutral transport fuels are just three of the climate transforming technologies in need of urgent investigation, according to leading scientists. The eminent group argue that, with governments failing to grasp the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange2\">urgent need for measures to combat dangerous climate change</a>, radical \u2013 and possibly dangerous \u2013 solutions must now be seriously considered.</p> <p>The idea of engineering on a planetary scale in a bid to control climate has been around for more than 50 years but, to date, has remained on the fringes. The potential for dramatic and beneficial change has hitherto been outweighed by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange1\">risk of unexpected side-effects in the complex climate system, with global consequences</a>. Now, in a special edition of the journal <a href=\"http://publishing.royalsociety.org/\">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</a>, climate scientists and engineers have brought together the latest research and issued a call for a far-reaching assessment of a raft of geo-engineering techniques.</p> <p>\"We are now, or soon will be, confronting issues of whether, when and how to engineer a climate that is more to our liking,\" argues Ken Caldeira, a leading climate scientist based at the <a href=\"http://www.ciw.edu/\">Carnegie Institution</a> in Stanford, California. If a decision is made to move ahead with climate engineering, he says, then it will be essential to understand the point at which the risks and costs of geo-engineering outweigh the impacts of global warming. </p> <p>Not everyone is so unequivocally positive, however, including <a href=\"http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/\">Stephen Schneider of Stanford University</a>. In an overall assessment of the geo-engineering challenge, he notes that critics ask whether it is socially feasible to expect the many centuries of international political stability and co-operation that would be needed to operate global scale schemes. He adds that the potential also exists for conflicts between nations if geo-engineering projects go wrong. </p> <h2>Air</h2> <p>Some of the most extreme ideas for climate engineering involve reducing the sunlight falling on the Earth's surface, as a way to offset the increase in temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Caldeira calculates that reflecting just 2% of the Sun's light from the right places on Earth (mainly the Arctic) would be enough to counteract the warming effect from a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p> <p>One approach is to insert \"scatterers\" into the stratosphere. Caldeira cites an idea to deploy jumbo jets into the upper atmosphere and deposit clouds of tiny particles there, such as sulphur dioxide. Dispersing around 1m tonnes of sulphur dioxide per year across 10m square kilometres of the atmosphere would be enough to reflect away sufficient amounts of sunlight. </p> <p>In a separate study, <a href=\"http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/harvieb/salter.html\">Stephen Salter of the University of Edinburgh</a> proposes building 300-tonne ships that could spray micrometre-sized drops of seawater into the air under stratocumulus clouds. \"The method is not intended to make new clouds. It will just make existing clouds whiter,\" he wrote. The ships would drag turbines in their wake, which would provide the power needed to spray the water.</p> <h2>Ocean</h2> <p>The growth of marine algae and other phytoplankton captures vast quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but growth is often limited by a lack of essential nutrients. Adding such nutrients, such as iron or nitrates, to stimulate growth was studied by a team led by <a href=\"http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/obe/index.php?action=staff_entry&amp;SID=234\">Richard Lampitt of the National Oceanography Centre</a> in Southampton. The organisms incorporate atmospheric CO2 as they grow and, when they die, sink to the bottom of the ocean, taking the carbon with them.</p> <p>Lampitt argues for a large-scale experiments of an area of ocean measuring 100km by 100km and monitored by an independent team of scientists. \"Once this research has been carried out, it will be the responsibility of the science community to perform appropriate cost-benefit-risk analyses in order to inform policy.\"</p> <p>However, there is at present a moratorium around the world on iron-seeding experiments. \"The idea is unpopular with the public because it is perceived as meddling with nature,\" writes Victor Smetacek of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany and Wajih Naqvi of the National Institute of Oceanography in India. But they say rejecting seeding is premature as there have been no experiments to date that fully test the concept and the counter-arguments are based on worst-case scenarios.</p> <h2>Transport</h2> <p>More a fifth of the world's human-induced emissions of carbon dioxide come from transport. While technical fixes for these emissions might not count as geo-engineering by the strictest definition, their global effect means they can be considered alongside other options to reduce the CO2 in the atmosphere. In the long term, experts believe people should be driving electric or hydrogen-fueled cars but those technologies will take too long to arrive for Frank Zeman of Columbia University and David Keith of the University of Calgary. </p> <p>They propose the development of synthetic fuels called carbon-neutral hydrocarbons (CNHC) as a near-term alternative to petrol and diesel. Made by reacting together carbon dioxide and hydrogen, these fuels can be used in cars without the need for major modification of either vehicles or infrastructure. More importantly, burning them would not contribute to global warming, provided the component ingredients have been manufactured in a carbon-neutral way. The CO2 could come directly from the air, from plants or else from coal-fired power stations using carbon capture and storage technology (CCS). The latter method could also reduce the potential problems of the planned worldwide increase in the number of fossil-fuel power stations. The <a href=\"http://www.iea.org/\">International Energy Agency</a> predicts the world's use of power will increase by 50% by 2030, with 77% of that coming from fossil fuels; CCS holds the promise of preventing up to 90% of the carbon emissions from a power station escaping into the atmosphere.</p> <h2>Wild Card</h2> <p>Other ideas considered by scientists, though not in the papers published today, include scrubbing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. Klaus Lackner of Columbia University has designed a machine that could, if built to full scale, take up the CO2 emissions of 15,000 cars. With around 250,000 such machines, it would be possible to remove as much CO2 from the atmosphere as the world is currently pumping into it. The gas could then be stored underground or used in a manufacturing process.</p> <p>An idea further into the realms of the fantastic involves using shiny spacecraft to block sunlight. Scientists have suggested launching a constellation of free-flying craft that would sit between the Sun and Earth forming a cylindrical cloud around half the Earth's diameter and 10 times longer. \"Approximately 10% of the sunlight passing through the 60,000 mile length of the cloud, pointing lengthwise between the Earth and the Sun would be diverted away from the Earth, which would uniformly reduce sunlight over the planet by approximately 2%,\" writes Stephen Schneider of Stanford University. The cost would be a dazzling $100bn (\u00a355.5bn) a year.</p>",
  "<p>Some might call it a lesson in the law of unintended consequences. For others, however, the bitter aftertaste of Tony Blair's saccharine-coated \"<a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page1297\">doctrine of the international community</a>\" was all too obvious when he outlined it nearly a decade ago. </p> <p>The reheated cold warriors who've fulminated over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/georgia\">events in the Caucasus</a> this month would do well to go back to that speech at the Chicago Economics Club in 1999. <br> Nato bombs were raining on Belgrade, eviscerating TV make-up women and destroying civilian infrastructure. Shamelessly, Blair posed as the stoic British prime minister who had voyaged across the Atlantic to remind America of its world historic role at the hour of Europe's need. </p> <p>\"On its 50th birthday Nato must prevail,\" he said, \"Success is the only exit strategy I am prepared to consider.\"</p> <p>He went on to locate the Kosovo war in the context of the then fashionable cliches of globalising capitalism and the changing roles of states and international alliances. The war's salience lay in recognising that the advance of the global free market depended on the preparedness of an undefined \"international community\" to, as he would put it two years later, \"reorder this world\" by force when necessary. </p> <p>Thus, according to Blair in his address to Chicago neo-liberals, \"The most pressing foreign policy problem we face is to identify the circumstances in which we should get actively involved in other people's conflicts\".</p> <p>That meant riding roughshod over the doctrine of the sovereignty of nation states dating from the peace of Westphalia \u2013 clearly his urge to modernise outdated notions had burst beyond such trifles as the welfare state and the Labour party. </p> <p>Those of us who protested were castigated and calumniated against as the real dyed in the wool conservatives who had not understood that the world had moved on. In fact, our concern was that the Kosovo intervention and its justification were taking the world back. The sovereignty of nations was never an inviolable and faultless principle \u2013 and none of us on the left had said otherwise. But Blair's humanitarian interventionism, his 21st century civilising mission, was no advance on it. </p> <p>It was a throwback to the Gladstonian liberal imperialism of the 1880s, which also was born with ballyhoo about Balkan atrocities, at that time Bulgarian. Two consequences flowed at the end of the 19th century. </p> <p>First, peoples across the globe rapidly came to suffer murder and mayhem far worse and more extensive than any visited by one Balkan nationality upon another. The carnage in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australasia still evades the North American and European imaginations because, quite simply, the victims were not white and the perpetrators were. </p> <p>Second, as other states decided that they too had a duty to civilise, the scramble for Africa, China and elsewhere brought the European powers first into diplomatic conflict and skirmish, and then, when conquests in neither the east nor the west had filled their maw, into a cataclysmic clash on their own continent. </p> <p>It's worth recalling the scorn heaped on those of us who raised these points nine years ago, warning of the vicious circle interventionist wars would unleash, and then turning to events today in the Black Sea's own Balkans. </p> <p>Perhaps the mandarins of King Charles Street have a manual on how to hold a straight face and keep talking when all around are gasping incredulously. Maybe there's an <em>homage</em> to Kipling along those lines. Or maybe it's just the way our current foreign secretary is eerily adopting the tics and mannerisms of our former prime minister. Either way, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/davidmiliband.ukraine\">David Miliband's performance over Georgia</a> has been a spectacle to behold.</p> <p>There was the bluster about the territorial integrity of small nations \u2013 this from a government that had only months previously proclaimed its support for ripping out Kosovo from what is left of Yugoslavia. The recognition by Washington and London of Kosovo's secession prompted a warning from Moscow, which, thanks to many years of Russian weakness and US triumphalism, was predictably ignored. </p> <p>There are other nations besides Kosovo that might want to secede elsewhere and with greater claim, said the Kremlin, and if you recognise Kosovo against our wishes, don't be surprised if we end up recognising other secessionists against yours. </p> <p>The frothing from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/russia.georgia1\">Miliband</a> and Condoleezza Rice when Russia did just that exposes the hypocrisy at the heart of western policy as outlined by Blair. When it comes down to it, for all the talk of universal moral objectives in international affairs, the right to pursue them turns out not to be universal, but to be vested in particular powers, and, it seems, some nations' rights are more inviolable than others. </p> <p>They call it the international community, but it is not even the community of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, still less the UN General Assembly. It is, as with Kosovo, a community that is coterminous with the biggest military alliance on the planet, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which has strayed very far indeed from the Atlantic. </p> <p>For more than a decade, successive British and US governments could get away with this sleight of hand. Russia was enfeebled, robbed blind by foreign-domiciled billionaires. China was just a manufactured-in stamp piled high in the pound shop. </p> <p>Not now. The unipolar future turns out to have been a moment in the past. And that makes the hubris that led from Kosovo through Iraq to today's missile shields and Cold War rhetoric all the more dangerous. One of the \"collateral casualties\" of the Kosovo war was the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. The result of a similar air strike in \"rogue\" capitals today doesn't bear thinking about. Nor do the consequences that would have flowed had Georgia been a member of Nato with its mutual military obligations. </p> <p>The Russian action in Georgia has underscored the limits of US power, but Anglo-US arrogance is unabated. For the US \u2013 despite the dying days of the Bush administration \u2013 there is a logic. It is a global power, still the only true global power. However dangerous the game, it's not difficult to see why the US establishment, and not merely the Bush regime, plays it. </p> <p>But why should Britain? Maybe it was the gap between western bombast and Russian facts on the ground, but there was something truly ridiculous about Miliband travelling to Ukraine to shake his fist at the east. He preached extending Nato membership to a country where two thirds of the people are not in favour of it and which is already ruptured by east/west tensions and internal conflicts that make Georgia look like Switzerland. </p> <p>The Labour government in London again managed to outflank to the right Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel and even Silvio Berlusconi \u2013 but for what? To share this time not in foolish, short-lived triumph in the Middle East, but in Bush's humiliation. </p> <p>The world is at that most dangerous of places: where one way of ordering states and systems is giving way to another. That usually doesn't happen without some major rupture and frequently with attendant violence. The worst place to be in such circumstances is as some ersatz power, an imperial hangover not of yesterday, but of the last century, busy threatening rising or renewing powers with the armies belonging to an ailing one. </p> <p>Georgia's hapless president, the New York lawyer Mikheil Saakashvili, has just learnt what it means to plunge into dangerous waters on the ebb tide. It's a lesson that Britain's political elite would do well to heed.</p>",

There's going to pages and pages written about this, especially since the new investors seem to be the Adu Dhabi royal family, who are richer than Roman Abramovich. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/01/manchestercity.premierleague\">All the latest news is behind this (appropriately) blue text.</a></p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>12.25pm:</strong> \"Not that it is of any interest, so it will fit perfectly in the Mill,\" jibes Pascal Hofmann. \"But Ajax are not letting go of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. Not that anyone would table an offer, but still.\" Meanwhile, John Bains is not a Newcastle fan. \"RE: Xisco. How appropriate that the Barcodes should sign a player named after a wild west hero \u2013 when they sign his partner Pancho, it will complete the whole cowboy outfit.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>12.33pm: Jason Shackell moves to Wolves from Norwich.</strong> Should that be in bold text? Why not, even though it is subject to a medical. \"Have Middlesborough signed any fans yet?\" zings Gary Naylor.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>12.40pm: </strong>\"I signed Xisco in Football Manager and he was a very good player,\" insists Brendan McCarthy, who goes on to rather undermine his argument. \"Until he got upset that I was playing Bobby Zamora ahead of him.\"</p> <p>And Stefano Seedorf, baby cousin of big Clarence, has signed for FC Den Bosch, according to Dutch football email correspondent Pascal Hofmann.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>12.54pm: Frustrated Guardian.co.uk reporter bids \u00a31.50 for minute-by-minute application that doesn't break down every five minutes</strong><br>Bid is rejected.</p> <p>\"Why was the Man City deal done today?\" asks James Dann. \"Is there a rule that says that club transfers have to be done during the window? Or is Thaksin hoping that by selling today, the Thai police wont notice that he's left the building to start a peaceful new life as a ditch cleaner named Mitch?\" It's a theory, although it actually started with an article on arabianbusiness.com that came out today. There were even some photos of the investors holding up a Man City shirt with \"Abu Dhabi United\" written on the back.</p> <p>And this from the one-man Dutch football rumour mill Pascal Hofmann, whose missive is best read in a Steve McClaren accent: \"Rosenborg BK have beaten Arsenal and Man United to the signature of Ghanese toptalent Anthony Annan. IK Start is on the receiving end of 1.2 mln Euro for letting go of the 22 year old defensive midfielder. He's signed up till 2011.\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>1pm: </strong>Here's Les Roopanarine to put me out of my misery and to guide you through the afternoon. Thanks for your emails and keep them coming to Les. His address is up there, look.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>1.12pm: </strong>Greetings all, and welcome to phase two of this tortuous journey through the world of transfer mayhem. Let's start with Crispin Lake's admirably thorough response to Mark Eyeington's enquiry about Randers (<strong>11.21am</strong>). \"Randers are situated on the island of Jutland and have been in the Superliga for a few years now,\" says Crispin, who as a Brit living in Danish exile should know. \"They are managed by Colin Todd, and his assistant trainer is Stig Tofting (ex-Hamburg and Bolton). Their goalkeeper is Kevin Stuhr Ellegaard (he played a few games for Man City) and other has-beens include Carsten Fredgaard (Sunderland) and Marc Nygaard (QPR).\" How the not-so-mighty have fallen.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>1.23pm: </strong>I can confirm that Howard wasn't kidding when he said our minute-by-minute application gives up the ghost every few minutes. And Ajax technical manager Danny Blind can confirm Pascal Hofmann's suspicion (<strong>12.25pm</strong>) that Ajax striker Klaas Jan Huntelaar, who has been linked with Real Madrid, Arsenal and Tottenham, is going nowhere. \"Selling such an important player on the last day of the transfer window is impossible,\" said Blind in De Telegraaf. Although clearly less impossible than getting this report to work properly.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>1.42pm: </strong>Anyone who missed Howard's earlier reference to Manchester City's rumoured British transfer record bid for Dimitar Berbatov (<strong>11.40am</strong>) - yes, Mike Higgins, I'm talking to you - will want to know that Manchester City have apparently made a bid for United target Dimitar Berbatov. It's rumoured that the bid would be a British transfer record (\u00a337m, since you ask).</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>1.52pm: </strong>Midfielder Blerim Dzemaili, who made just one appearance for Bolton last season, will have to wait awhile before making another. Torino have signed the 22-year-old on a one-year loan deal. Meanwhile, Berbatov apparently legged it from Spurs training this morning - pausing only for a quick fag, one would imagine - to board a plane from Stansted to Manchester. But whereabouts in Manchester? Meanwhile, Arno Onink - who probably has to spell his name to people down the phone as frequently as yours truly - asks: \"Is that minute-by-minute application run by BAA?\" Very probably.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>2.02pm: </strong>West Ham defender George McCartney is having a medical at Sunderland. Meanwhile, Spurs boss Juande Ramos says of the Berbatov saga: \"One way or another, I hope it's finalised today.\" And so say all of us.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>2.06pm: </strong>\"A big good afternoon and welcome to you too, Les,\" says a cheery Hugh Watson. \"Or should it be Roop?\" No, Hugh, it most certainly should not. \"And if so, is that pronounced like Co-op?\" I have no idea. \"Why can't David Moyes get anyone to sign for Everton?\" asks Hugh, suddenly coming over all sensible. \"I mean, he must be a reasonably good manager because they're always finishing far higher than they deserve to, given their dreadfully thin squad. And they're not a small club, really \u2013 with a fair bit of tradition. You'd have thought there would be a queue half way up Gwladys Street. It's a mystery, that's what it is.\" Well Hugh, they signed Lars Christian Jacobsen and Segundo Castillo last week - the real problem seems to be finding quality. How Moyes could do with a marquee player to appease the fans.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>2.14pm: </strong>\"Wouldn't it be delicious,\" says Tom Hopkins, \"if - after all his whining about going to a bigger, better club in Manchester - Berbatov got shipped out to Man City? God surely does have a sense of humour after all.\" I'm saying nothing, Tom.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2.20pm: </strong>\"Julian Gray is apparently around the Fulham area having gone up for a medical ahead of a move,\" writes Donald Cox, kindly pointing me in the direction of <a href=\"http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/coventry-city-fc/coventry-city-fc-news/2008/09/01/julian-gray-set-to-join-fulham-92746-21649147/\">this</a> snippet from the Coventry Telegraph. \"As a Coventry fan, this makes me love Roy Hodgson even more than before,\" says Donald, shattering the fond illusions of Fulham fans everywhere.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>2.27pm: </strong>\"It would be all the more delicious,\" says Robert Jones in response to Tom Hopkins (<strong>2.14pm</strong>), \"if in addition to your Berbatov theory Wenger stepped in and took Robinho on loan.\" Now you're talking. Sadly, however, the reality is rather more mundane: Hull are hoping to seal a loan move for Rangers striker Daniel Cousin.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>2.32pm: </strong>The grinding of the Manchester rumour mill continues unabated. Mark Hughes has reportedly confirmed that City's bid for Dimitar Berbatov is genuine, and says that he is set to meet the broody Bulgarian for talks later today. What's more, he might even tear himself away from the golf course to do so.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>2.34pm: </strong>\"Is it me, or does Mark Hughes have a fantastic sense of humour?\" asks Gareth Bourne. \"His main activity today is scuppering his city rivals from getting the player they have coveted for a year. Berbatov won't want to go to City, though, because they are not in Big Cup - and Tottenham won't sell to United for a lesser amount if they have had a higher offer elsewhere.\" Fair point.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>2.39pm: </strong>\"Why do these super rich types only buy clubs who play in blue?\" muses Simon Martin. \"Is it that red was traditionally the colour of communists, and they are concerned that if they bought such a club their money could be used to purchase tractors which are then distributed to the poor of the parish?\" Any billionaires contemplating the bucking of that trend should address their enquiries to Mr R. Parry, Chief Executive, Anfield Road, Liverpool L4 0TH ...</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>2.45pm: </strong>While we're on the subject of Merseyside, Everton fans may be relieved to hear that Louis Saha has signed a two-year deal, with the option of a third, after passing his medical. Or they may not. Meanwhile, Stoke have apparently tabled a \u00a35m bid for Cardiff midfielder Joe Ledley. Tony Pulis also has a beady eye on Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant, who would command a similar price.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>2.54pm: </strong>\"Chelsea defender Paolo Ferreira is currently talking to West Ham about a move down the table but in the starting XI,\" writes Pascal Hofmann, thoughtfully saving me the bother.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>2.59pm: </strong>\"Wigan Athletic's third choice keeper, Carlo Nash, looks set to become Everton's second choice keeper if the Liverpool Daily Post is to be believed,\" points out Adam Leier, continuing the good work begun by Pascal while even going one better by pointing me in the direction of <a href=\"http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/everton-fc/everton-fc-news/2008/09/01/everton-on-verge-of-signing-carlo-nash-from-wigan-athletic-64375-21649152/\">this piece from the Liverpool Daily Post</a>.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>3.04pm: </strong>If you Google 'Victor Nsofor Obinna', the following Wikipedia link tops the list: \"Victor Roger Charlie Zulu Nsofor Obinna (born March 25, 1987 in Jos, Nigeria) is a Nigerian footballer who plays as a striker for Everton.\" He doesn't. And he won't. Obinna's work permit application has been declined, scuppering a projected loan move to Goodison Park.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>3.08pm: </strong>Alex Walsh wins the award for the afternoon's first Louis Saha gag: \"Apparently Saha has broken his wrist signing the Everton contract this afternoon. He is expected to be out for the next four weeks.\" If Saha weren't so injury prone, would United fans - given the speculation surrounding Berbatov - be ruing Fergie's decision to bundle the French striker off to Goodison?</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>3.17pm: </strong>Unsurprisingly, the transfer antics of a certain Bulgarian are dominating your email contributions right now. A selection: \"If Man City are to sign Berbatov, how much of his decision to eschew the bright lights of the other side of Manchester might be attributed to the presence (and presumably persuasion) of Martin Petrov?\" (Stewart Airey); \"Wouldn't Spurs be shooting themselves in the foot by selling Berbatov to City? After all, it's much more likely that City are going to be their closest rivals this year - for UEFA cup, league position etc\" (Ben Wilkie); \"As a Spurs fan I would like to see Berbs sod off, and it would be funny if he went to Man City. Not only would we get more money, but Man Utd wouldn't get him. As long as the sulker goes - we've all had enough\" (Will Bouma - presumably not the Aston Villa model).</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>3.26pm: </strong>Moving lightly on, Giles Page wants to know \"if any<br>kind billionaires have decided to take over another club in blue - chiefly, Brighton? Any more transfers?\" Sadly for Seagulls fans, no. But watch this space, Giles, because boss Micky Adams had this to say after Saturday's goalless draw with Leyton Orient: \"After performances like that you have to consider every option. Maybe we will sit down and have a little think about things.\" Best get a move on, Mr Adams.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>3.35pm: </strong> BREAKING NEWS!!!! Manchester City's bid for Dimitar Berbatov is \u00a334m - not \u00a337m, \u00a330m-plus, or even \u00a37m more than the offer tabled by United. You heard it here first. Meanwhile, Mark Hughes has had this to say: \"We've made an offer and now it's about the boy making a decision. We're very excited about what's going on.\" Well, there's no accounting for taste.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>3.39pm: </strong>Stoke have agreed a fee to re-sign Danny Higginbotham, who left the Britannia Stadium for Sunderland last summer. Meanwhile, this tantalising snippet from Stephen Connelly: \"My brother-in-law, who works in a supermarket in Airdrie, has just phoned to tell me that Wayne Bridge was in his shop looking for the Hoops. He duly showed him the aisle where the spaghetti hoops are kept, but it was the green and white hoops of Celtic he was after. A one-year loan deal, I'm reliably told by Meat Counter Manager Mick Cronin.\" Don't you just love transfer deadline day?</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>3.44pm: </strong>... and here's another transfer gem, this time from Nicholas Cendrowicz: \"Apparently Steve Finnan has been transferred to Espanyol. That's what Marca is saying!\" Heady times, Nicholas; heady times.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>3.49pm: </strong>After making just one appearance for Wigan since his arrival from Sparta Rotterdam last summer, Dutch winger Rachid Bouaouzan if off to warm the bench at Eredivisie side NEC Nijmegen instead. Meanwhile, some well-earned gloating from David Hendry: \"Remember at <strong>11.40</strong> when you (your colleague) called my Berbatov to City story \"right old Bunkum\"? Well look at you all now!!! Ahahahahaaahhhaaahahahaa (Evil Mr Burns-esque crazed laugh of power).\" Fair dos, David.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>3.55pm: </strong>\"Hey, Roop,\" writes Alan Cooper, continuing a disturbing trend, \"how can you have missed the utterly thrilling news that Ipswich have signed Jon Stead on loan from Sheffield Utd? At least it has actually happened (unlike the Berbatov nonsense).\" How indeed? For the record, the deal will run until January and a fee has already been agreed should Ipswich boss Jim Magilton see fit to make the move permanent.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>4.05pm: </strong>Berbatov? Pah! \"Miguel \u00c1ngel Llera to the MK Dons - wow!\" enthuses Michael Garton. The Spanish defender joins from Spanish Second Division side Hercules CF. At least he will if he can successfully negotiate the 6,497 roundabouts that stand between the M1 and stadium:mk. Meanwhile, Zenit St Petersburg have declared - categorically, finally and irrevocably - that Andrei Arshavin will not be moving in this transfer window. Don't rejoice too soon, though: it simply means we'll have to revisit the whole wretched saga again come January.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>4.10pm: </strong>Steve Finnan's move to Espanyol has been confirmed. You wonder how that will go down with Liverpool fans - is Arbeloa really a better bet for the right-back slot than the classy Republic of Ireland international?</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>4.20pm: </strong>Interesting question from Liam Walsh, who writes: \"I was just wondering if Manchester City can actually make any signings today. Are they not bound by the 'due diligence' stuff that happens when someone takes over a club? Or did I miss all of that?\" Good point, Liam. City will indeed be bound by due diligence, but presumably there's nothing to stop the new owners injecting cash into the club up-front should they so wish.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>4.22pm: </strong>This just in from the increasingly indispensable Pascal Hofmann: \"Collins John is joining Bouaouzan in moving to NEC Nijmegen. The 22-year-old is on a free transfer from Fulham, pending a medical.\"</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>4.29pm: </strong>Remember Arsenal? Christiaan Hartsuiker does. \"So far only uninteresting clubs have signed uninteresting players, and all the hype has made the Berbatov transfer saga equally uninteresting, so all that I can think of being interesting is the potential totally out-of-the-blue signing Arsene Wenger will make today,\" writes a clearly uninterested Christian. In more interesting news - well, marginally - Bristol City have signed John Akinde from Ebbsfleet (or Gravesend and Northfleet, as some of us traditionalists still prefer to think of them). Akinde's switch makes a little piece of transfer history: it's the first to be decided by a club's support. 82.3% of Ebbsfleet's owners, myfootballclub.co.uk, voted in favour of letting the 19-year-old head for Ashton Gate.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>4.36pm: </strong>Ye gods and little fishes, as my fearsome sixth-form teacher used to say in primary school, what is going on with this Berbatov transfer? Oh, sorry - I'm meant to be telling you, aren't I? Well, I can tell you this: Berbatov has apparently been spotted at Manchester United's Carrington training ground. Looks like Mark Hughes can remain focussed on his golf after all.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>4.41pm: </strong> Liverpool's car-boot sale continues as Andriy Voronin packs his lead-lined strikers' boots and heads back to the Bundesliga. Hertha Berlin have agreed to take the Ukrainian on a season-long loan.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>4.45pm: </strong>\"Yes! Great news for Liverpool fans!\" purrs Alistair Cubbon, happily conceding that his undisguised delight over Voronin's departure does \"nothing for Anglo-German relations.\" Meanwhile, Southampton manager Jan Poortvliet has signed 21-year old attacker Romain Gasmi from RC Strasbourg. \"The midfielder currently has a broken foot but should still be more useful than Rudi Skacel,\" sighs Tony Lehrle-Fry.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>4.50pm: </strong>BREAKING NEWS!!! Reports are emerging from Spain that Real Madrid have made a \u00a336.5m bid for - cue drum roll - Dimitar Berbatov.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>4.54pm: </strong>I'm still trying to get my head round the latest twist in the Berbatov story. Still, let's be grateful for small mercies: at least this stultifying saga - in it's latest, three-headed format, at any rate - has been compressed into a few hours. \"Howdy The Roop/Rooper/El Rooperino (if you're not into the whole brevity thing),\" writes Michael Friel - who, I would venture, is a good deal less amusing than he might imagine - \"with Madrid now sticking their oar in the question has to be asked - is Berbatov that good? I mean, REALLY?\"</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>5.04pm: </strong>\"This transfer window has been horrendous for us,\" writes Liverpool fan Chris Marshall, still reeling from the sale of Steve Finnan. \"We've wasted weeks chasing a midfielder who isn't better than we already have, miserably failed to strengthen properly by buying players we actually need - like wingers - spanked \u00a320m on a very over-rated Irishman, and now just got rid of a very under-rated Irishman for sod all. Rafa is really testing our faith.\" What is it they say up your way, Chris? In Rafa we trust? For the sake of a competitive league, if nothing else, let's hope Benitez is a man with a plan.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>5.09pm: </strong>Tottenham are set to replace Dimitar Berbatov with ... Emile Heskey!!! And in a further twist, Dr Sulaiman Al-Fahim, the prospective new owner of Manchester City, has apparently revealed that - never mind Berbatov - the club have registered bids for Valencia's David Villa and Stuttgart's Mario Gomez.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>5.15pm: </strong>Goalkeeper Mark Bunn has joined Blackburn from Northampton for an undisclosed fee. Bunn, who has signed a four-year deal, was apparently whisked out of the reckoning for Northampton's weekend clash with Tranmere Rovers and told to head for Lancashire pronto. \"I'm absolutely delighted to be here,\" said Bunn. \"It is a dream come true really.\" Meanwhile, apropos of Berbatov's alleged presence at Carrington, David Savage wants to know: \"Was this just before Elvis arrived, or just after?\"</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>5.25pm: </strong>David Hendry, who first opened the can of worms containing a certain Mr Berbatov at <strong>11.40</strong> this morning, has stuck his head gingerly above the parapet to plead for forgiveness. \"I agree with Michael,\" says David, \"he isn't that good, and I thoroughly regret bringing everyone's attention to the article in the first place. Apologies.\" No need to be sorry, David - particularly given that Tottenham have apparently accepted City's offer.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>5.33pm: </strong>\"Heskey to replace Berba?\" stammers an incredulous Andres Tomlin. \"Please say it ain't so!! Surely with the additional \u00a310m in euros being thrown in our lap we can afford to make Zenit an offer they'd be daft to refuse.\" Apparently not, Andres - word is Zenit won't be allowing Arshavin to move until January at the earliest (see below, <strong>4.05pm</strong>).</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>5.36pm: </strong>\"Best transfer window news for Southend fans, watch us take League One!\" enthuses Paul Napper after learning - from <a href=\"http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/latestsport/Freedman-verge-Shrimpers-switch/article-300489-detail/article.html\">the Croydon Advertiser, no less</a> - that Crystal Palace striker Dougie Freedman is set to sign a two-year deal with the Shrimpers.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>5.44pm: </strong> Liverpool have confirmed the signing of winger Albert Riera from Espanyol on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee. And Porto winger Ricardo Quaresma is now Inter Milan winger Ricardo Quaresma after signing a five-year deal with the Serie A champions; Pele - no, not that one - has headed in the opposite direction. \"Roopster,\" writes David Henry - whom I hold personally responsible for the fact that I've just received an email from a certain someone containing the words \"Roop-di-doo\" - \"does Mark Hughes know about any of <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_city/s/1064963_city_bid_for_villa_and_gomez\">this</a> or is he still playing golf?\" Who knows, Henry, who knows?</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>5.51pm: </strong>Liverpool fans may have their reservations about the Riera deal, but they aren't shared by Rafael Benitez. \"\"Riera has the qualities we were looking for,\" said Benitez following confirmation of the midfielder's arrival. \"He's a left footer who normally plays on the left wing, he's good in the air, strong, powerful and a good crosser of the ball. He's the kind of player we have been talking about. He can beat players and get good deliveries into the area for our strikers.\"</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>5.55pm: </strong>West Brom have confirmed the loan signing of Ryan Donk, the AZ Alkmaar defender. Joey Barton is apparently being pursued by a top-10 Premier League club. And Tom Soares, the Crystal Palace midfielder, is on his way to Stoke to discuss personal terms after the two clubs agreed a fee.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>6.04pm: </strong>Jonathan Grounds, the Middlesbrough defender, has joined Norwich on a three-month loan. Joel Shippey, however, has more pressing matters on his mind. \"Is no one else worried by Rafa's statement that Riera 'normally' plays on the left wing?\" he wonders. \"Given his track record recently, I expect to see Riera at right-back next week.\"</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>6.11pm: </strong>Marca claim that Diego Milito has returned to Genoa from Real Zaragoza, who have also reportedly signed Palermo's Bosko Jankovic on loan. Not that Paul Moser cares. \"In the absence of any top rated footballers here in Paris (including all of the PSG team), I've been reduced to looking up what 'roop' means. It is to make a hoarse sound. And 'narine' means nostril in French. Need I go on?\" Thanks all the same, Paul, but I think we'd best leave it there.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>6.18pm: </strong>\"For Berbatov, a fitness-test consists of visiting as many teams as possible in one day,\" quips Ian Copestake. Latest word is that Berbatov has met with Lord Fergie at Carrington - despite the fact that he doesn't have permission to do so, Tottenham having only agreed a fee with Man City.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>6.25pm: </strong>\"Liverpool are so desperate for a left-winger I'd be happy if they signed Michael Foot,\" sighs Nath Jones. Jonathan Norman, however, is more worried about Andriy Voronin's departure from Anfield. \"I don't see how getting rid of Voronin is a good thing for Liverpool if he isn't replaced,\" says Jonathan. \"He really wasn't that bad a backup and we now have only a 19-year-old Frenchman, barely out of his football diapers, as replacement for Torres, who is currently injured. I remain unconvinced.\"</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>6.34pm: </strong>It's not just Liverpool fans who are disillusioned with the day's transfer dealings. \"On Saturday's showing, Dougie Freedman would have to average three to four goals a game for us to stay up,\" laments Southend fan Bryan Pugs. \"And after the unbearable drabness of the summer transfer window, wouldn't it be better to condense the whole thing into one day?\" It feels like they did, Bryan.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>6.41pm: </strong>Birmingham midfielder Sone Aluko is heading north after Aberdeen secured a deal to bring the 19-year-old, who spent last season on loan at the club, back to Pittodrie. \"Hello there Roop Doggy-dog,\" writes Tim Travers, the latest man to push his luck when it comes to naming names. \"I see that after the City farce Thaksin Shinawatra is to remain at the club as honorary president.

The Swiss international has signed a contract extension with Udinese that should keep him at the club until the end of the 2012/13 campaign. \"I never had any doubts,\" said Inler. \"From the first day I was certain I would remain at Udinese.\" He might have said so sooner.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>7.10pm:</strong> As the technical gremlins with which we began this epic return, last word goes to Archi Campbell: \"We could call you Lord Rhoop, after the crazed Narnian nobleman found by the voyagers of the dawntreader in the land where nightmares come true.

Starting price \u00a325 million.\"</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>8.01pm</strong> It was a three-year contract for Riordan is anyone was wondering, someone must have been. \"Joey Barton is being pursued by a top 10 Premier League club (5.55pm) - Is it Arsenal, with big sticks?\" Arfs Hugh Macguire.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>8.04pm</strong> Guess who Man City have been linked with now? Robinho. You couldn't make it up, though Real Madrid mouthpiece Marca just have. No really, they are reporting it on Sky. Meanwhile the latest news on Berbatov (keep it on the hush hush) is that he is possibly unsettled at Spurs and may be considering a move.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>8.08pm</strong> \"Is Naylor just trying to take his mind off the fact that Man U had to get rid of Saha via Freecycle? 'Offered: one piece of striking furniture. Very elegant but possibly unreliable legs. New owner must collect,'\" writes Jack Lee. Is having a report at the Tottenham training ground really going to help Sky break any news on Berbatov at all? It is dark and everyone has clearly gone home. I have a feel Berbatov's not going to return there anytime soon.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>8.14pm</strong> Two potential deals for Hull today and here we go with confirmation on them ... Daniel Cousin has signed from Rangers on a three-year deal. As for Frazier Campbell, nothing as of yet but Wigan are considering a gazzumping.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>8.18pm</strong> In a far off land where the population aren't obsessed with a Bulgarian's movements around a cotton-trading town, Genoa have signed Real Zaragoza's Argentinian forward Diego Milito. Yes, signed him, actual news, I knew such a thing existed. \"As one person who was interested, thank you for the Riordan info,\" writes Derek Adamson. No worries Derek, all part of the service, anything else you wanted to discuss? \"Yes Josh, any news on Ashton to Villa though?\" Nope.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>8.22pm</strong> Burnley have signed Steve Thompson from Cardiff for free. Talking of cheap ... \"I've just transferred \u00a375 from my savings to my current account to see me through until my payday which is 2 weeks off,\" boom booms Kevin Rainey, who theguardian.com's Alan Gardner has just described as a frugal miser for such cheap living antics.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>8.25pm</strong> According to Sky Joey Barton is at St James' Park \"thrashing out his future\". Surely that is not the most responsible verb to use when discussing Barton.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>8.29pm</strong> If anyone is enjoying this wonderful day of dealing too much, then here is the email for you: \"Seems like the last days of Rome, what with a global economic crisis, the premier league are looking to collectively spank 100s of millions on overrated, overvalued ball-kickers - must make hard up fans really happy to hand over \u00a340 a match,\" writes Rich Holman over strains of Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>8.36pm</strong> NON-TRANSFER NEWS: Kevin Bond has been sacked by Bournmouth. But what does that mean for Dimitar Berbatov? Nothing. Meanwhile, Mark Hughes has spent his day playing golf while Alex Ferguson picked Berbatov up from the airport. I just can't work out who he is going to join. In class-war news, Kevin Rainey is not taking Alan Gardner's abuse lying down: \"Guilty as charged ... unfortunately I'm not paid the vast sums available to the sandle wearing brigade at Guardian Towers, meaning it beans on toast from here on out (thats baked beans not mung beans by the way),\" he writes. Gardner tells me that beans of toast (mung or otherwise) is his favourite meal and he even had it for lunch today. He also would like it made clear he went to a comprehensive and has never been in a Waitrose. In short, it's like working with Che Guevara here.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>8.43pm</strong> My favourite quote so far today comes from Espanyol sporting director Paco Herrera who has bigged up new signing Steve Finnan with the following: \"He is always worth a 'seven' in ratings.\" Another man who plays too much Championship Manager there.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>8.48pm</strong> A couple of ebay listings for a certain man: First up Mark Judd: \"For sale: One misunderstood, deep thinking European footballer, likes an occasional cigarette, no trouble once gets own way. Buy him now for \u00a334m or will swap for tricky Portuguese winger who also likes to try to get his own way. No time wasters\" while Peter Richards goes with: \"Bulgarian import, well rested, guaranteed to demand attention.\" I think we should call an end to this Berbatov chat, I hereby refuse to write his name again until something actually happens.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>8.55pm</strong> According to Sky's man on the ground the body language at the Britannia Stadium hints that they aren't signing Jermaine Pennant (no, I have no idea either). However, they are signing Danny Higginbottom and Tom Soares has just turned up. Meanwhile, the wonderful Plymouth Argyle are close to signing Glen Whelan from them. It's all gone there. And here is more news from Sky's man at the Britannia, Emile Heskey is possibly moving to Aston Villa (Once again, no, I have no idea either).</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>9pm</strong> Ok, Man City news. It's from good sources. Forget Villa and Gomez, they have not made bids for them. But a bid has been made for a certain Bulgarian and Robinho. Is that news? It'll have to be, it's all I have.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>9.05pm</strong> Many emails about when Berbatov Deadline Day actually ends. Jut to be clear it is midnight, when he will turn into a pumpkin, or perhaps sign for a Manchester club (perhaps not Stockport). One further complication: \"Do you realize that in some parts of the world it is tomorrow already and all this is over,\" writes Mark Judd. If any of you readers live in any of these places can you just email me to tell me where Berbatov went and then we can all go home. Cheers.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>9.07pm</strong> Apparently there are rumours now that Michael Owen is going to ... guess who? Manchester City. Well, after telling me that Sky have just told me it's rubbish. Why tell me in the first place then? In Heskey news, we are all still clueless. Clueless!</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>9.12pm</strong> Stoke have signed Danny Higginbottom. Confirmed. Pop those champagne corks Potters fans, it's all true. And here is some more news from a certain sport based TV channel, Martin O'Neill's phone is going straight to answer phone. No, really. What a day to forget to charge your mobile, nightmare. I can however confirm he is pushing through the Emile Heskey deal via Facebook chat.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>9.18pm</strong> Tony Pullis is going transfer mad, Joe Ledley hoping to become their 48th transfer of the day. Meanwhile there is a new face in the Berbatov race: \"We've had a whip-round in the lab,\" writes Dave Booth of the Derpartment of Physiology at the University of Liverpool (shouldn't he be doing some research or something). \"We've got a bid of 9.56 ... er ... pounds, 47 Polish Zlotys, half a pack of chocolate Hob-Nobs and a cactus named Rex. We're looking for a one-in one-out deal for our own eastern European who's no-so good in the air. Take it or leave it Spurs, the Hob-Nobs aren't getting any fresher.\" Well, I have heard Berbatov has been spotted in the north-west, that I can confirm. The plot thickens.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>9.27pm</strong> Everton have signed Carlo Nash. Message ends.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>9.32pm</strong> \"Surely Martin O'Neill's phone might just be engaged?\" Says Eddie Robson and he might be right. There is only one way to sort this out, does any have Martin O'Neill's number?</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>9.36pm</strong> Berbatov has arrived at Old Trafford, I think he might be about to sign for them. Maybe. \"Any fool knows that the real game is now called Football Manager after the makers of the original CM, SI Games lost the rights to the name. The game known as Championship Manager these days is but a pale imitation,\" writes Jeff Black. I gave up after the 97/98 version, Jeff. The pinnacle of management simulation and no transfer deadline until March in those days.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>9.45pm</strong> The next person who emails me to say they have seen Berbatov in an amusing place and that he is now signing for someone unlikely is going to get a strongly worded reply. Though a special mention for Stewart Harper for an excellent joke about Bulgarian cigarettes.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>9.51pm</strong> I will be honest, we are in a lull. Where is Tony Pullis when you need him? Nothing, absolutely nothing, is happening.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>9.53pm</strong> \"I recall that in CM 97/98 edition (I agree; undoubtedly the pinnacle of football management games) you could bid as much as you wanted for a player, then when the club inevitably accepted your \u00a320 million offer, you could revise it down to \u00a30 and get the player for free,\" writes Ed Bayling. \"Perhaps this is strategy Citeh are following today?\" We'll never know, it looks like they won't be signing anyone at this rate.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>10pm</strong> Just TWO HOURS to go now. And as we speak Sir Alex Ferguson and Dimitar Berbatov are in conversation, presumably about him signing for them but that is only speculation. But here we go, this is the big one, a deal has been AGREED for Robinho to move to Manchester City, \u00a332m. Wow, what you going to do about that Chelsea?</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>10.05pm</strong> So, the big news is Robinho is moving to Manchester City. The credit for this must go to the emaillers who all sent me the link to the Spanish site that reported this, sadly I can't speak Spanish so that is why i was a bit slow on the uptake.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>10.08pm</strong> To those that have asked for me to clear up the Berbatov cigarette joke from Stewart Harper earlier. I can't, it is not website-ready. It is very funny though. In terms of Championship Manager 97/98, the real story of the day, \"Two words. Ibrahima. Bakayoko,\" writes Paul Ansorge. \"It was always rumoured that Walter Smith only signed him because of how good he was in 97/98.\"</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>10.12pm</strong> There is a rumour that Frazier Campbell will be heading to Tottenham in part exchange for a certain person. Surely not. Meanwhile Stoke have upped their bid for for Joe Ledley to \u00a36m. That is a lot of honk for a Championship player.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>10.15pm</strong> Joey Barton is staying at Newcastle, his move to \"a top ten Premier League club\" fell at the final hurdle.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>10.17pm</strong> Richard Jeffries has sent me this brilliant link: <a href=\"http://www.manutd.com/publish.sps?pagegid=%7BFE60904B-C2A8-4E60-9B05-700DBBC29BBC%7D&amp;teamid=443&amp;section=playerProfile&amp;bioid=4130\">here</a></p> <p>I have no idea if it is fake? But I can confirm the big news, he will be wearing number nine.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>10.22pm</strong> More link fun, for those that requested a Spanish article on Robinho going to City, here you are: <a href=\"http://www.as.com/futbol/articulo/robinho-manchester-city/dasftb/20080901dasdasftb_28/Tes\">link</a></p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>10.25pm</strong> Don't forget that it is easy to fake these kind of <a href=\"http://www.manutd.com/publish.sps?pagegid=%7BFE60904B-C2A8-4E60-9B05-700DBBC29BBC%7D&amp;teamid=443&amp;section=playerProfile&amp;bioid=4299\">pages</a>. in conclusion we know no more than we did this morning. In other news Alexei Smertin has had his contract terminated with just 95 minutes to find a new club.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>10.30pm</strong> So it looks like that site was a fake then, how embarrassing. I have received around 400 emails of other examples of players there are pages for. My favourite, Marlon Brooms. He was excellent in Champ Man 97/98 coincidently.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>10.35pm</strong> For those questioning the Spanish link for the Robinho story, they are all over it on Sky Sports too. So believe. News from Richard Graveling, \"Norwich have signed Antoine Sibierski on loan from Wigan, it's on the club website. That's the big one! I can go to bed now,\" night Richard.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>10.39pm</strong> You know what I told you about Daniel Cousin moving to Hull earlier, it was true. All t's crossed and i's dotted etc. By the way, ignore that Spanish article, as has been pointed out by many, many, many people they still think Sven Goran-Eriksson is the Manchester City manager. Robinho is still City bound though.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>10.44pm</strong> \"If the link Spanish-speakers are sending is by notoriously unreliable AS newspaper, said news story says that he is going to Sven Goran Eriksson's City ... which I assume is Cancun, Mexico ... \" boom booms Duncan Bishop.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>10.49pm</strong> Joey Barton has apparently texted into Sky to say he wanted to stay at Newcastle all along. The age we live in, huh? I have yet to receive a text myself, but then he hasn't got my number.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>10.55pm</strong> Transfer news from Holland via Pascal Hofmann: \"Ooijer and AZ Alkmaar. Well, it's official, that deal is off. And, Danny Blind is keeping his (and my) word and will still not be selling Huntelaar, even though \"astronomic offers\" have been made, according to NOS.nl.\" See, I have contacts!</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>10.59pm</strong> \"Unattached players can be signed after the window closes so you needn't worry about Alexei Smertin, not that I suspect anyone was,\" writes James Hudson. Phew. So, only an hour left, what will happen?</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>11.02pm</strong> Julian Gray has moved from Coventry to Fulham. Elsewhere, fans ourside the City of Stadium are singing \"we've got Robinho, we've got Robinho etc\". That is evidence enough for me. As for Berbatov, it is just a matter of time as we all know.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>11.06pm</strong> News from Spain: \"Spanish TV have the Robinho story, to city for 40 million euros. And Calderon saying it is best for both the player and the club,\" writes Brad in Valencia. While Pablo Requejo writes: \"Real Madrid\u00b4s president is now speaking and he has said than Robinho has been sold to Manchester City. Transfer made by \u20ac42m. He said that Cristiano Ronaldo maybe could land in Real Madrid next year.\" Let's not even get into that one.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>11.10pm</strong> Robinho news: \"We have agreed to sell the player for human reasons, and for footballing reasons and for an important quantity of money,\" Real president Ramon Calderon told Spanish television station VEO. \"After consulting with the technical staff we have decided it was the best decision for the group and the club.\" But who has he been sold to?</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>11.12pm</strong> REAL MADRID HAVE CONFIRMED THEY HAVE AGREED TO SELL ROBINHO TO MAN CITY. I didn't think I'd be writing that when I woke up this morning.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>11.16pm</strong> Some more transfers not containing Robinho and Berbatov, a change is as good as a rest. \"Two Belgian sites are now saying it's a done deal for Fellaini to go to Goodison \u2013 The first decent bit of progress for us toffees all day,\" writes Hugh Watson, who loses marks for referring to me as Widdyroo. \"There are some rumours over here in Sweden that Ola Toivonens agent, former player Martin Dahlin, is closing in on transfer deal with Stoke,\" writes Go22at, which might not be his real name but an email pseudonym.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>11.19pm</strong> Berbatov will wear the number nine shirt, didn't I tell you.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>11.23pm</strong> Frazier Campbell is on his way to Spurs, so says <a href=\"http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/sportpreview/Breaking-news-Fraizer-Campbell-Tottenham-Hull-City/article-301068-detail/article.html\">this</a>. Thanks to Gary Robinson for that, excellent work.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>11.25pm</strong> Poor old Arsenal, Mike Johnson sums up the mood of the emails I have received from Gooners tonight: \"Why haven't you written anything about Arsenal signing anyone better than Abou Diaby. Why? I'm going to fly to London from Philadelphia and fight Arsene Wenger if nothing happens in the next 40 minutes.\" think about your carbon footprint Mike, it's not worth it.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>11.30pm</strong> News from Wolves, via the very helpful Tom Bason: \"Why no mention of the transfer goings on at Molineux? George Friend (there must be a pun in there for you somewhere!!) signs from Exeter and Matt Hill and Stephen Elliott switch clubs in two allegedly completely unrelated transfers. It's a hotbed of activity- how many other clubs have signed no fewer than three defenders today?\" And as I type that ROBINHO HAS SIGNED FOR MANCHESTER CITY.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>11.33pm</strong> \"Does nobody else realise that Police Academy 1 is on right now?\" Asks Anthony Browne.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>11.34pm</strong> In my attempts to make this website appeal to football fans from outside the Greater Manchester area, here is some news from Stoke. They probably won't get Joe Ledley, they might get Tom Soares or even Michael Tonge though. And ... and ... they may add Henry Camara to that. Come on Pullis, get a move on.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>11.39pm</strong> And not sure how true this is but it is a transfer free-for-all now in my email inbox. \"Aston Villa have sealed a deal with Swedish team Malmo FF over Ola Toivonen and the price is believed to be around 1.6\u00a3 million. They hijacked him in a last minute bid, infront of Stoke who have been interested. Ola Toivonen have played in the same clubs as the Swedish internationals Olof Mellberg (Degerfors)and Markus Allback (\u00d6rgryte)who probably have told him good things about the club. He have also for a few weeks ago expressed his dream to play in the Premier League,\" says my source ds22cp again.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>11.44pm</strong> \"Oh come on, surely all the stories involving Manchester Utd must appeal to the people outside of the Greater Manchester region? I'm loving all the Man City stories from out here in Sydney. What? Eh? Oh \u2026 \" writes Gavin Hudson, somewhat predictably. I'll be honest, we're playing out time now, time for one more big transfer?</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>11.48pm</strong> I'm waiting ... only 12 minutes to sign that deal</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>11.50pm:</strong> The latest Frazier Who? news: \"Despite the BBC having the Campbell to Spurs story as well (we had it first). Sky seem to think its Hull may still sign him. Mind you the reporter did start referring to Frazier Richardson halfway through his report. Is this Richardson any good? I've never<br>heard of him,\" writes Gary Robinson. I don't expect him to cause much of an impact Gary.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>11.53pm</strong> \"Reports on the radio here in Melbourne, that Everton have signed Green Gully (Australian A league) striker, John Markovski,\" writes Gavin Knight. I'll take your word for it Gavin.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>11.55pm</strong> Frazier Campbell is going nowhere now. Unless something changes in the next five minutes.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>11.57pm</strong> I think we might be done for the night, tick tock tick tock ...</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>12.00am</strong> My friends, it is all over. \"Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind? Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and auld lang syne?

You must keep posting until at least 4am,\" writes Alan Cooper. Oh. I'll be here until about 1am.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>12.10am</strong> Not much happening though.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>12.13am</strong> I'm just going to join Dimitar Berbatov in a cigarette for five minutes while everyone chews over these words from Mark Hughes: \"I am absolutely delighted to get the opportunity to work with such an incredible talent like Robinho. I have said that in order to compete with the best teams in the Premier League we have to be in the market for players of this calibre, and Robinho is undoubtedly one of the best players in the world. I am really looking forward to introducing him to the rest of the squad, and to the City fans at the earliest opportunity. This is a real statement of intent as to the ambitions of Manchester City Football Club\"</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>12.25am</strong> Me again. Just to confirm there is no actual statement on Berbatov, but we are pretty sure he has signed on the say so of people more in the know than us. And here is some news for Newcastle fans, striker Xisco has signed from Deportivo on a five-year deal. He's a Spanish under-21 striker for those who have never heard of him.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>12.30am</strong> Stoke have failed with Joe Ledley and Henri Camara but they have signed Tom Soares from Crystal Palace and Michael Tonge from Sheffield United. Not a bad hit rate, better than Chelsea's.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>12.36am</strong> Nothing official on Berbatov, but he has left in a car from Old Trafford and here is some news ... Frazier Campbell has gone to Spurs on a season-long loan and BERBATOV HAS SIGNED FOR MANCHESTER UNITED FOR \u00a330.7m. At last.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>12.40am</strong> And I think just about brings an end to this wonderful evening of gossip and dealing. Thank you for all your emails (a huge amount), sorry for the ones I couldn't use. Cheers.</p>",
  "<p>As the red carpet is readied for the 17th anniversary of Uzbekistan's independence from the Soviet Union on September 1, for the majority of the population the euphoria of the freedom celebrations is countered by the ruthless suppression of citizen and civil society freedoms.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.umid.uz/Main/Uzbekistan/Constitution/constitution.html\">constitution of Uzbekistan</a> emphatically guarantees citizens the right to engage in public life by holding rallies, meetings and demonstrations. In practice, however, any attempts by citizens to peacefully gather to express opinions on public affairs are consistently met with stiff official resistance and hurriedly dispersed by government troops. Democratic dissent is countered by official intimidation and harassment including arbitrary detention. Activist Mutabar Tojiboyeva, who was awarded this year's Martin Ennals award for human rights, was forced to spend nearly <a href=\"http://us.oneworld.net/article/release-ailing-uzbek-rights-activist-demanded\">three years in prison</a> because she dared to question the tragic <a href=\"http://www.iansa.org/regions/scasia/andijan.htm\">2005 massacre</a> of over 500 protestors by security forces in Andijan. To date, no officials have been held responsible for the widespread loss of life. Mutabar was providing support to the victims and their family members at the time of her arrest. She was ill-treated and subject to constant torture in prison. As a result, her health deteriorated significantly. Mutabar was finally released in March this year after considerable international pressure. Although she continues to serve a suspended sentence, she remains firm in her resolve to continue to speak out against official excesses. </p> <p>At the time of writing, another civil society voice, poet and thinker Yusuf Juma, who had the courage to protest peacefully against the controversial re-election of President Karimov in December 2007, is currently serving a four-year prison term. Juma's family alleges that he has been <a href=\"http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/node/1381\">tortured severely</a>. His 22-year-old son, who was also arrested by the authorities, is missing. The official version is that he escaped. The family fears much worse.<br> The extent of suppression of civil liberties in Uzbekistan can be gauged by the restrictive Rules of Holding Mass Events brought into force in 2003 to regulate the freedom of assembly. The rules avoid any mention of the constitutional freedom to organise street marches, pickets and demonstrations. Instead, the definition of mass events is limited to \"theatrical entertainment, concert, sport, advertising and other entertaining programmes, along with the celebration of national, religious and professional events\". As a result, the legislation fails to recognise legitimate forms of public protest that are both regionally and internationally accepted. In addition, organisers are required to obtain permission from the authorities to hold any event at least one month in advance. The application is then passed through various government departments in a complicated and time-consuming approval process. Even if an event is allowed, representatives from the secret service and the Ministry of the Interior then maintain constant surveillance during the proceedings for possible threats to \"social order and safety\". They are allowed to summarily call off an event at any time. Additionally, to keep public assemblies under constant surveillance, organisers of mass events are required to allocate a minimum of 10 seats in each section and a seat in each row for members of the territorial organs of the internal security services and the national security service. </p> <p>Moreover, there are severe restrictions on the freedom to associate and carry out civil society activities. NGOs must compulsorily register before being allowed to function. Permission to register is often subjectively denied, particularly to those organisations that are likely to offer independent views and legitimate criticism of official policies. For instance, pickets and demonstrations organised by the unregistered Human Rights Defenders Alliance of Uzbekistan in the last three years have been constantly disbanded by the police and national security service troops, followed by arrests and physical assaults on participants. After each weekly protest, these <a href=\"http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR620132005?open&amp;of=ENG-UZB\">human rights defenders</a> are detained for periods ranging from hours to several days. Their homes are under constant surveillance. Random searches and administrative penalties are routine occurrences. Aside from NGOs, faith-based groups and professional associations also undergo extensive scrutiny and harassment. Between 2003 to 2007, there were 300 confirmed <a href=\"http://www.groundreport.com/Arts_and_Culture/NGO-Numbers-Wane-in-Uzbekistan\">closures of civil society organisations</a>. </p> <p>Given the prevailing environment, independence day celebrations ring hollow. If freedom is to be truly realised, constitutional rights must be a living reality for the people and civil society of Uzbekistan, rather than mere promises on paper. </p> <p><em>Tanzilya Salimdjanova &amp; Mandeep Tiwana both work with Civicus: World Alliance for Citizen Participation.

However, the wider point is not the pros and cons of particular technologies, but that the scientific community is becoming so scared of our collective inability to tackle climate emissions that such outlandish schemes are being considered for serious study. We already have the technology and know-how to make dramatic cuts in global emissions - but it's not happening, and those closest to the climate science are coming near to pressing the panic button.</p> <p>Politically, the West needs to lead the climate fight. Most of our emissions come from fossil fuels used in the production of energy - but there should be no shortage of power. The amount of energy that the Sun beats down onto the Earth's surface each year is more than 10,000 times greater than our annual energy use. And we're not short on clean technology - solar photovoltaics, concentrated solar thermal power stations, wind, biomass and increasingly tidal technologies are all demonstrated and available. </p> <p>These could be deployed rapidly if we were able to muster the kind of political will and serious levels of finance that were necessary to perpetrate the Iraq war. So why do we find ourselves seeking geo-engineering solutions as some kind of magic bullet to counter the climate problem? <br> While signs of panic emerge from the science community, decisions are made in the UK that will entrench new greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come. Those who oppose these decisions face the wrath of a lethargic state. Over the summer a grassroots, climate camp protest about new coal-fired power stations saw as many police deployed as protestors. </p> <p>While the real climate solutions are blocked by vested interests seeking big bucks from coal, runways and forest destruction, our government tells us that it is taking \"tough decisions\" by cosying up to them. The scientist's focus on tinkering with our entire planetary system is not a dynamic new technological and scientific frontier, but an expression of political despair.</p> <p>\u00b7 Doug Parr is chief scientist for Greenpeace UK</p>",
  "<p>What are the planetary health risks of geo-engineering intervention? Nothing we do is likely to sterilise the Earth, but the consequences of planetary scale intervention could hugely affect humans. </p> <p>Putative geo-engineers are in a position similar to that of physicians before the 1940s. The author-physician Lewis Thomas remarkably described in his 1983 book, The Youngest Science, the practice of medicine before the Second World War. There were only five effective medicines available: morphine for pain, quinine for malaria, insulin for diabetes, digitalis for heart disease and aspirin for inflammation and very little was known of their mode of action. For almost all other ailments, there was nothing available but nostrums and comforting words. </p> <p>At that time, despite a well-founded science of physiology, we were still ignorant about the human body or the host\u2013parasite relationship it had with other organisms. Wise physicians knew that letting nature take its course without intervention would often allow natural self-regulation to make the cure. They were not averse to claiming credit for their skill when this happened. </p> <p>I think the same may be true about planetary medicine; our ignorance of the Earth system is overwhelming and intensified by the tendency to favour model simulations over experiments, observation and measurement. </p> <p>Global heating would not have happened but for the rapid expansion in numbers and wealth of humanity. Had we heeded Malthus's warning and kept the human population to less than one billion, we would not now be facing a torrid future. Whether or not we go for the recommendations for cutting back fossil fuel use discussed in <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_13/items/4049.php\">Bali in 2007 </a>or use geo-engineering, the planet is likely, massively and cruelly, to cull us, in the same merciless way that we have eliminated so many species by changing their environment into one where survival is difficult. </p> <p>Before we start geo-engineering we have to raise the following question: are we sufficiently talented to take on what might become the onerous permanent task of keeping the Earth in homeostasis? Consider what might happen if we start by using a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080217094602.htm\">stratospheric aerosol</a> to ameliorate global heating; even if it succeeds, it would not be long before we face the additional problem of ocean acidification. This would need another medicine, and so on. </p> <p>We could find ourselves enslaved in a Kafka-like world from which there is no escape. Sir Martin Rees in his 2003 book <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/martin_rees_asks_is_this_our_final_century.html\">The Final Century</a>, envisaged a similar but more technologically based fate brought on by our unbridled creativity. </p> <p>The alternative is the acceptance of a massive natural cull of humanity and a return to an Earth that freely regulates itself but in the hot state. Garrett Hardin foresaw consequences of this kind in his seminal 1968 essay <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\">The Tragedy of the Commons</a>.<br> Whatever we do is likely to lead to death on a scale that makes all previous wars, famines and disasters small. To continue business as usual will probably kill most of us during the century. Is there any reason to believe that fully implementing Bali, with sustainable development and the full use of renewable energy, would kill less? We have to consider seriously that as with nineteenth century medicine, the best option is often kind words and pain killers but otherwise do nothing and let Nature take its course.</p> <p>The usual response to such bitter realism is: then there is no hope for us, and we can do nothing to avoid our plight. This is far from true. We can adapt to climate change and this will allow us to make the best use of the refuge areas of the world that escape the worst heat and drought. We have to marshal our resources soon and if a safe form of geo-engineering buys us a little time then we must use it. </p> <p>Parts of the world such as oceanic islands, the Arctic basin and oases <br>on the continents will still be habitable in a hot world. We need to regard them as lifeboats and see that there are sufficient sources of food and energy to sustain us as a species. Physicians have the Hippocratic Oath; perhaps we need something similar for our practice of planetary medicine. </p> <p>During the global heating of the early <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene-Eocene_Thermal_Maximum\">Eocene</a>, there appears to have been no great extinction of species and this may have been because life had time to migrate to the cooler regions near the Arctic and Antarctic and remain there until the planet cooled again. This may happen again and humans, animals and plants are already migrating. Scandinavia and the oceanic parts of northern Europe such as the British Isles may be spared the worst of heat and drought that global heating brings. This puts a special responsibility upon us to stay civilized and give refuge to the unimaginably large influx of climate refugees. </p> <p>Perhaps the saddest thing is that if we fail and humans become extinct, the Earth System, Gaia, will lose as much as or more than we do. In human civilisation, the planet has a precious resource. We are not merely a disease; we are, through our intelligence and communication, the planetary equivalent of a nervous system. </p> <p>We should be the heart and mind of the Earth not its malady. Perhaps the greatest value of the Gaia concept lies in its metaphor of a living Earth, which reminds us that we are part of it and that our contract with Gaia is not about human rights alone, but includes human obligations. </p> <p>\u00b7 <a href=\"http://www.jameslovelock.org/page0.html\">James Lovelock</a> is an independent scientist, author, researcher, environmentalist.
