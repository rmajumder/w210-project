  "<p>Britain's biggest mortgage lender yesterday heightened growing recession fears when it revealed that the year-long credit crunch had wiped \u00a320,000 off the cost of a home in the biggest annual fall in property prices on record.</p> <p>On the day that rising inflation forced the Bank of England to leave interest rates unchanged at 5%, the Halifax said house prices last month were 11% down on a year earlier - the first double-digit decline since its monthly healthcheck of the market was first published 25 years ago. Prices in the past six months have been falling at an annual rate of 20%, but the Treasury sought last night to downplay the prospect of a stamp duty holiday for first-time buyers, saying it was only one of a number of options being considered for an autumn economic package.</p> <p>Business groups and City analysts warned that deep and rapid cuts in the cost of borrowing would be needed next year to pull Britain out of its first recession in more than 15 years. House prices are falling more rapidly than they were in the property crash of the late 1980s and early 1990s, while official figures released yesterday showed orders for housebuilding 33% down on a year ago and orders for commercial property down 38%.</p> <p>Fresh evidence of the impact of the global financial turmoil will emerge today when the Royal Bank of Scotland is expected to unveil losses of \u00a31.2bn - the biggest in British banking history. Barclays yesterday announced profits down by a third, warning that it saw no end to the tough conditions of the past 12 months.</p> <p>Despite mounting signs that the economy is entering its first recession since the early 1990s, Threadneedle Street left the cost of borrowing on hold for a fourth month yesterday. Inflation is running at almost double the government's 2% target and is predicted to rise to around 5% over the coming months as dearer domestic energy bills affect the cost of living.</p> <p>The Bank will use Wednesday's quarterly inflation report to disclose that growth will be lower and inflation higher than it expected three months ago, and while business leaders said last night they understood the constraint imposed on the Bank by a rising cost of living they urged it to act as soon as price pressures started to abate.</p> <p>Stewart Robertson, director general of the British Retail Consortium, said the downturn in the high street was deepening. \"To avoid turning the slowdown into a slump, as soon as conditions allow, the Bank's next rate move should be down.\"</p> <p>Roger Bootle, economic adviser to the consultants Deloitte, said: \"The longer inflation fears force the MPC to leave interest rates on hold at 5% the more severe the looming recession will be. Interest rates will, eventually, have to fall very far to lift the UK economy out of its current malaise.\" </p> <p>He saw house prices falling by a third and that falling inflation would prompt a series of rate cuts in 2009. \"Once interest rates start to fall I think that they will be cut rapidly, perhaps all the way to 3.5% by next summer, and perhaps even lower subsequently. However, this will come too late to prevent an outright recession later this year and a long period of very weak economic activity thereafter.\"</p> <p>The Halifax said house prices fell by 1.7% in July - the fifth successive fall of more than 1.5%. The average price of a home stood at \u00a3177,351 last month, down from \u00a3199,084 in July 2007. Suren Thiru, economist at the Halifax, said: \"Pressure on householders' income, together with a very significant reduction in mortgage finance due to the global financial crisis, is constraining potential house buyers' ability to enter the market. This is resulting in both lower prices and activity levels.\"</p> <p>Although falling house prices will eventually make property more affordable for first-time buyers, City analysts believe the decline is part of a wider malaise caused by weaker demand at home and abroad, and the difficulty in securing credit.</p> <p>RBS is expected today to announce a \u00a35.9bn writedown and a loss five times as high as that reported by Barclays during the early 1990s - the previous record. Yesterday Barclays said its profits were down 30% at \u00a32.75bn as the credit crunch forced it to take a writedown on investments that have turned toxic in the credit crunch. Chief executive John Varley said: \"It would be wrong to suggest that the market conditions over the foreseeable future will be anything other than tough.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Chinese demand for PCs boosts Lenovo profits</h2> <p>Lenovo, the world's fourth largest PC maker, said yesterday its quarterly profits rose 65% as strong sales in China and emerging economies offset weakness in the United States. Profit for the three months to June 30 was $110m (\u00a356.5m). Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's chairman, expressed confidence that the Beijing Olympics, which open today, will help the company's efforts to establish a global brand. Lenovo is supplying computer equipment and technicians to the games. China accounted for 41% of sales. Sales in the US and the rest of the Americas fell 4.8% to $1.1bn. <br><strong>Associated Press</strong></p> <h2>Liverpool firm Cains goes into administration</h2> <p>Liverpool brewery Cains, which makes own-label beers for supermarkets as well as its own brands, has been placed into administration. The company has struggled since its reverse takeover of Aim-listed pub group Honeycombe Leisure in June last year. The business came close to collapse in 1990 and 2002; on the second occasion it was rescued by brothers Sudarghara and Ajmail Dusanj. Cains' Stanhope Street brewery is a Liverpool landmark. Discussions between the Dusanj brothers and the Bank of Scotland broke down yesterday, forcing the firm to call in the administrators. <br><strong>Simon Bowers</strong></p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336340023\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The most lavish Olympic games of the modern era will get under way today in the spectacular Bird's Nest stadium, with more than 80 heads of state joining 91,000 spectators and 15,000 performers for an opening ceremony expected to attract a global television audience of more than 3bn people.</p> <p>Despite concerns over pollution, security and human rights, the organisers are promising a 16-day extravaganza of sport; their spokesman, Sun Weide, said: \"Of course, we hope that these will be a great games, even the greatest.\"</p> <p>It will certainly start with a bang as 35,000 fireworks illuminate the five-hour ceremony. The identity of the athlete who will light the torch has not been announced and the method that will be used to elevate the Olympic flame from the track to the cauldron suspended 350 feet above on the roof of the stadium remains shrouded in secrecy. </p> <p>Billions of dollars and seven years of planning have gone into preparing the city for these games, and last night the sense of expectation was palpable. The boundaries of the Olympic Green, the main sports thoroughfare, were thronged with sightseers drawn to the spectacular illuminations of the stadium and the Water Cube aquatic centre, pulsing a deep blue as night fell.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the organisers will be hoping for a change in the weather to disperse the smog that tends to hang over the national stadium. Beijing's air pollution index yesterday was recorded at 96 , which came close to exceeding the national level for acceptable air. Today's forecast is for overcast skies with a slight chance of showers in the afternoon; greater relief may come at the weekend, with a forecast of moderate rain that could help wash out pollutants.</p> <p>Another cloud on the horizon is the issue of drugs. Although there have been no positive tests out of more than 600 carried out in the past two weeks, John Fahey, the president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, warned yesterday that sport could not risk another big drugs scandal. \"If we don't [tackle doping], part of the world will leave us because the public will desert any sport, any time, if they are not satisfied it has integrity,\" he said.</p> <p>The significance of this moment for China and its relations with the rest of the world is clear from the most high-profile guestlist the Olympic movement has ever seen. For the Beijing regime, the opening ceremony is a political event as important as the sporting spectacular, and yesterday the country's president, Hu Jintao, held audiences with a dozen state leaders and royal family members. George Bush heads a list that includes the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, Israel's president, Shimon Peres, and his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy.</p> <p>Of the main developed nations, only Britain and Germany are not represented by their most senior politician, though Gordon Brown will attend the closing ceremony. His predecessor, Tony Blair, will be there, however, as will the Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, and sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe. </p> <p>London's mayor, Boris Johnson, is staying away until the end of the games when he will receive the Olympic flag from the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge. Ken Livingstone, the man he beat in June's election, is in Beijing as a guest of the city authorities.</p> <p>Those in attendance will witness an athletes' parade that has been touched by politics and will reflect the diplomatic tensions between the US and China that surfaced this week. A day after China revoked the visa of the 2002 speed-skating gold medallist Joey Cheek for fear that he would speak out against Beijing's support for the Sudanese regime accused of sponsoring genocide in Darfur, the US team announced that Lopez Lomong, a refugee from Sudan, would carry the stars and stripes at the head of the team.</p> <p>Rogge also announced yesterday that the North and South Korean teams will not be marching together as they did in Athens and Sydney. Instead, they will march in one after the other, with North Korea coming first, courtesy of the Mandarin alphabet used to decide the order. </p> <p>Rogge said he was convinced the games would be a positive step for China and its engagement with the rest of the world. \"The excitement I feel and the IOC feels is that of an athlete before a major competition,\" he said.</p> <p>\"As for the significance of these games, each games is important for the Olympic movement, and each has its own identity. Clearly in Greece the games was going back to its roots, to its birthplace in the home of classicism. China will be opening up the games to one fifth of mankind, and the next games in London will be in the country that invented modern sport and gave athleticism to the world.</p> <p>\"I think this will mean a lot for the perception of China. On the one hand for the rest of the world to discover China will be to discover a country that is for most of the world a bit mysterious. But they will find a country with 5,000 years of history, a fascinating country. I believe the spotlight on China will help the world to understand China, and it will also help China to understand the world.\"</p>",
  "<p>Parts of Britain suffered flooding yesterday after downpours from southern England to Scotland.</p> <p>The wettest weather was in Scotland, where 53mm of rain (just over two inches) fell at Edinburgh Airport in 24 hours.</p> <p>A number of roads in Edinburgh were closed because of the downpours. Around 10 houses in Brunstane Mill Road were flooded after the Figgate Burn burst its banks. Firefighters were using portable pumps to take water out of the houses. </p> <p>There were also fears of flooding in Renfrewshire, with concerns that a dam could burst.</p> <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) said there was one severe flood warning and six flood warnings in place across Scotland.</p> <p>Train services between Edinburgh and Glasgow Queen Street and from North Berwick to the Scottish capital were also disrupted, with warnings to expect cancellations and delays.</p> <p>Julian Mayes, senior forecaster with MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: \"We can expect more unsettled weather at the weekend, but it will be cooler and more breezy,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>That's the way to travel, with a letter of introduction to a Baltic baron and a copy of Horace. Serially expelled from every school he attended - once for falling in love with the greengrocer's daughter - Patrick Leigh Fermor, aged 18, set off in hob-nailed boots to walk to Constantinople. Fifty quid, he thought, should cover it. He was away six years. His mother's parting gift was, slightly surprisingly, a copy of Horace.</p> <p><strong>Travellers' Century</strong> (BBC4) threw open a window on a world that is no longer there. When Patrick (Paddy to his friends, and he made friends easily) started his walk, Europe was still dotted with little princelings, like chessmen on a board. All swept away now, though their sumptuous palaces, dripping with crystal, remain. On the other hand, The Red Ox in Heidelberg, a student-boozer barnacled with beer mugs, is exactly as he described it and is still run by the same family. It follows, therefore, that is it safer to be a publican than a prince. </p> <p>Benedict Allen said: \"With the help of his now-legendary magnetism he was passed from one grand castle to the next, adopted by retired archdukes, counts and countesses.\" Particularly, one suspects, countesses. When all his possessions were stolen, the Baltic baron (\"My dear boy!\") turned up trumps and even replaced his Horace. Remember Horace. I shall be asking questions.</p> <p>I'd say he worked at being welcome. Living with Hungarian swineherds, he learned their language. No joke, even for a good linguist. Working with Cretan partisans during the war, \"He slept with them. He ate what they ate. He put on their clothes. He drank with them (that was important). He became one of them.\" His mission was to kidnap General Kreipe, the German commandant in Crete, which he duly did by standing in the middle of the road and ordering his car to stop in German. </p> <p>Bundled into a cave by his captors, Kreipe greeted the dawn by quoting Horace. Leigh Fermor completed the quotation. \"And,\" he said, \"everything was very different afterwards.\"</p> <p>In an entertaining postscript to these stirring events, the two men met again in a Greek version of This Is Your Life. To say it was basic hardly covers its deficiencies decently. It was in black and white. The presenter, a dead ringer for Emo Philips, the dislocated comedian, had trouble pronouncing his name. Before our eyes, Patrick Leigh Fermor morphed from guest to host. He included everybody, translating fluently from German into Greek and back again, and giving the chaos a warm core. </p> <p>He didn't write the story of his journey for 50 years, and when he did it was entirely from memory. Which brings us back to Horace. I think if you learn great chunks of stuff by heart as a child, you probably develop a phenomenally muscled memory. He is 92 now, having outlived even the object of his journey, Constantinople. </p> <p><strong>Born to be Wild</strong> (BBC4) was about those who prefer to holiday modestly in Britain, doing their bit for wildlife. I was particularly taken by Bob Swann, an ornithologist engaged in mortal combat with a shag (\"a very aggressive bird\"). Scaling a cliff with a common-or-garden ladder, he lassooed the shag with a sort of fishing rod. The shag took it personally. \"They are fearsome fighters,\" said Bob, vanishing under an outraged onslaught of squawks and feathers. Shags are under attack from global warming. God help global warming. </p> <p>Vanessa-Mae's <strong>The Making of Me </strong>(BBC1) explored the roots of musical talent. Psychologists, of course, differed. One thought it was innate, one thought it was the product of practice (she had put in, she calculated, 7,107.5 hours) and one gave her a Cat scan with her violin. As there was no room for the bow, he asked her to play the violin with her left hand and then with her unpractised right hand. The first produced a few areas of intense activity; the second was much more diffuse and confused. Vanessa-Mae, surveying all this cerebral throbbing, said it put her off eating offal. </p> <p>She is a very vivid little person, assured and articulate.</p> <p>On this matter I stand shoulder to shoulder with Bertie Wooster, who said: \"When you've heard one violin solo, you've heard them all.\" You are either musical or not. And, if not, you'll get no sympathy. </p> <p>Anyone who positively prefers silence will get a good kicking for it. Edith Sitwell was black and blue by the end of Facade because Constant Lambert kicked her constantly (appropriately enough) to tell her where to come in. Jane Austen wrote: \"I have been listening to dreadful insanity. It is Mr H's firm belief that a person not musical is fit for every sort of wickedness. I ventured to assert a little on the other side but wished the cause in abler hands.\" By and large, if you think it sounds like a cat snagging nylon, just shut up about it. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>What did you think?

  "<p>'You feel bad. You don't want to take their wedding rings from them - that's their memories and everything,\" says Michael Bruce from behind a row of thick steel bars. \"But they need the money and that's what we are here for.\"</p> <p>Bruce holds out a black velvet jewellery tray. Each row holds a dozen wedding and engagement rings: big diamond, little diamond, stylish or gaudy, he has dozens. \"When they take the ring off their finger, they get all choked up. It's just something you got to deal with ... that's just the way the economy is - it's trash.\"</p> <p>Bruce, whom everyone here calls Junior, is the manager at a pawnshop on the outskirts of Hollywood, Florida, itself a diamond of a city in a perfect setting of Atlantic beaches. \"It is easier for them to pull a ring off their finger than to bring in a lawn mower\" to raise some cash, says Bruce, who every day sees Americans so desperate not to default on their mortgage payments that they come to his shop to sell \"everything from musical equipment to the gold teeth from their mouths\". </p> <p>No one seems to have cash, debts are piled high and even the banks appear to be running out of money, says Junior. \"Better to lose your ring than your house.\" </p> <p>Junior's pawnshop sits alongside a faceless strip mall, across the street from a cement fortress - the sheriff's office - 30km north of Miami's South Beach. Inside a steady stream of people come in to sell off their possessions. There's a stack of palmtop computers, brand new Bose speakers and so many Guess watches that Junior won't take them any more. \"I get the guy who drives up in the Bentley, and the people who walk in. No one has cash.\"</p> <p>Down the street at Circuit City, an electronics store, the 18-year-old sales clerk, Alex, agrees. \"Before, the economy was booming, the stock market was OK and people could spend. Now nothing is the same, a lot more people are struggling. There are more lower class than middle class,\" he says. \"Do you know how many foreclosures there are every day? My aunt sells real estate and every day she has new foreclosures [by banks]. People just don't have enough money.\" Alex says he is already planning to leave the US to look for work overseas. \"I don't think the country is going to go bankrupt, but if the next president can't get the economy going, I'm moving to Spain.\"</p> <p>The collapse of the local economy is obvious along the palm-shaded streets of Hollywood, Florida. Instead of \"Welcome to Hollywood\", the first sign a visitor now sees is a bright yellow sign stuck into the flowers. It reads: \"Sell Your House, Fast Ca$h 954-294-5420.\"</p> <p>Answering the phone at that number is Ricardo Morales, 39, who set up his own website, <a href=\"http://ricardobuyshouses.com\">ricardobuyshouses.com</a>, and has been scooping up properties for as little as 25% of their listed value. \"The banks have properties that are listed at $240,000 [\u00a3123,000], but now they are dumping them for $89,000 [\u00a346,000]. That seems to be their favourite price now - $89,000 and we are talking a three-bedroom, four-bath home in a nice area. The banks are dropping the prices like crazy.\" </p> <p>In 2007, Hollywood, Florida, was elected \"All America City\" by the National Civic League, a tribute to its sense of community and progressive social policies. Now it seems only to epitomise America's housing slump. Earlier this week, the government-sponsored mortgage giant Freddie Mac said that the country was facing the biggest decline in property values since the 1930s. In Hollywood, practically every street is packed with \"For Sale\" or \"Open House\" signs. On some streets five or six houses in a row are for sale, most with additional details like \"Price Reduced\" or \"Foreclosure\".</p> <p>In a normal economy, no neighbour would ever so publicly admit to running out of cash and finding their house seized. Today the front doors are plastered with notices like \"Sheriff's Notice\" and \"Final Notice of Eviction.\" </p> <p>Instead of signs for lost poodles and beagles, the telephone poles and traffic signs in Hollywood are plastered with handwritten signs pleading, \"Buy my home.\" One homeowner simply bought an \"Open House\" sign and scrawled in bad handwriting a single word: \"CHEAP.\"</p> <p>I follow the \"cheap\" trail and find a tired home, in a quiet neighbourhood, next to golf courses and a canal. The beach is quite close, about 15 blocks away. The owner is simply gone. He left the front and back doors open. </p> <p>A box of cockroach poison sits on the table next to a piece of paper with a cellphone number. The house is abandoned, wires coil from the walls, the plants are dead and it looks like the owner just simply gave up. I wait an hour, but no one appears.</p> <p>Pawning wedding rings and abandoning homes are just two small indications of the turbulence that is not only destabilising the US economy but also risks throwing the global economy into a stall. From 1995 to 2005, the US economy grew steadily. Housing prices in many areas trebled. Then in late 2005, the economy peaked. Housing prices slowed, went flat, and then started to fall. Prices for condominiums in the Hollywood area have fallen by approximately 40%. People who bought in 2005, 2006, or 2007 now owe the bank much more than their home is worth.</p> <p>Nowhere has the economy been more crushed than southern Florida, where Hollywood sits. As developers, speculators and investors saw year after year of 20%-plus gains in property prices, money poured in. Banks joined the party by offering a novel kind of loan - \"no documentation\". Applicants would simply be asked by a bank's loan officer, \"How much do you earn?\" and \"Have you ever been bankrupt?\" and most important \"How much money do you need?\" </p> <p>\"There was a lot of fraud. People would lie about how much they earned ... Whatever you put was true. You put down your salary and they gave you $1m and said, 'Go buy a house,'\" explains Carlos Justo, a broker who has worked in property for 30 years. \"I had a client - he's a banker - and he said, \"Carlos, my 13-year-old son could get a mortgage. He has a social-security number and a tax ID. If he had applied, he could have gotten $1m.\"</p> <p>As the banks made little effort to verify the information, \"credit-challenged\" applicants were often able to get the now notorious sub-prime loans - contracts that allowed for two or three years of minimal payments and then an increase of 500%, so that an $800 monthly payment suddenly balloons into $4,000 a month.</p> <p>\"You want to know how crazy it got?\" asks Katerina Brosda, a 28-year-old estate agent. \"At one point [in 2006] I was walking around with 57 cheques for $100,000 each in my pocketbook, for two weeks! Each one was a deposit for a new condo and I walked around with my purse like this ...\" She clutches her white Chanel purse close to her chest. \"I had a couple of associates who were sleeping out in a tent waiting to get into the sales office to buy a condo and I saw people fighting over units, hitting each other over who was going to get the last one.\" </p> <p>These days the locals are struggling to dig themselves out of debt. At the Hollywood public library, in the section where they sell off used or surplus books, the only empty shelf is the section on financial help. </p> <p>\"We can't keep that kind of book in stock. As soon as they come in, they go out,\" said Antoni, a grey-haired, bespectacled man in his 60s who is a library volunteer. \"People are just upping and leaving. For the middle class on down, it is going to be a heartache.\" </p> <p>With so much chaos in the economy, everyone you meet on the streets of Hollywood is either a property expert or a victim. \"It's all about greed,\" says a man in an SUV the size of a bus. \"George Bush spent a trillion dollars on this war in Iraq; what is that going to do to our grandchildren? He's going to cause another great depression.\" While he blocks the street and ignores cries to move his Chevrolet Excursion and let traffic through, he tells me that the meltdown has shaken his faith in America. \"I never thought that Americans could do this to Americans.\" </p> <p>Around the corner, standing outside his three-bedroom home, notionally worth $780,000 (\u00a3390,000), \"Jim Robinson\" - he refuses to give his real name - smokes a cigar and admits that if he wanted to sell, he would have to drop the price to about $600,000. But he sees the economic collapse as extending far wider than housing: \"This country is no longer an industrial power. We don't even manufacture steel, the Saudis own 30% of Wall Street and Dubai had to bail out Citibank.\"</p> <p>With his dense tattoos and tales of gunfights in the Sudan, Robinson is an ex-mercenary who has travelled widely in the developing world, in conditions of drought, starvation and war. Now he sees those same chaotic conditions engulfing his beloved Hollywood. \"These people are so clueless about what is happening beyond their compact little world, they are absolutely clueless as to what the potential [for economic meltdown] could be. You shut down the grocery store for a day and they panic. Look at what happens when we have a hurricane! People go to stores and fight over a loaf of bread.\"</p> <p>Bob Boynce, a south-Florida estate agent, also sees signs of panic. \"People are walking away from their homes,\" he says. \"We sold homes to young couples four years ago for $400,000. Now they could only sell for $275,000, so they are walking out and losing it all. This is happening in great numbers. You won't see that in the newspapers.\" He describes this new generation, known as \"the walkers\": \"Their [mortgage] payments may be $4,000 a month. They can rent a place for $1,700. They are cutting their payments in half. The only thing that can be done to them [for defaulting] is that their credit rating will be bad. They can't arrest you; it is not a crime. This is happening by the thousands; I have two close friends who have done this.\"</p> <p>\"Walking\" has become endemic in parts of urban America where house-price falls have been particularly steep, and the pattern is often the same. First the family move out their furniture. Then the car. Finally they post the keys back to the bank. In the morning, when the bank employees go to collect the day's mail, the box of letters often rattles, the sound of so many keys clanging together. This too has a name: \"jingle mail.\" </p> <p>But with the locals out of cash, who is buying? \"The foreigners are coming in droves: 80% of the people coming into our office are from England, France, Germany, Italy. Between the falling prices and falling dollar, they can buy here for practically nothing. Who wouldn't be here?\" says Paul Merlesena, a local estate agent who notes that some of the first homes at auction have just sold for $240,000. \"Last year they were selling for $660,000.\" Looking a bit sad, he says: \"If this was all reversed, America would be eating up Europe.\" Another group of buyers has started moving in at the luxury end of the market in parts of the Miami area - wealthy Russians. Fond of winter sunshine and gated security, Russians are picking up mansions whose price tags have become increasingly attractive thanks to the weak dollar.</p> <p>In the US media, the housing meltdown has been portrayed as a series of isolated events, rather than a connected body of evidence pointing to another great depression. Outside an office building in Hollywood, crates of unopened mail dumped in a skip give an indication of the breakdown that is occurring between ordinary Americans and the financial system.</p> <p>The first letter I pick up is dated March 25 and addressed to Isaac from Miami: \"Your debt to Land Rover Capital Group is still unpaid,\" it begins, offering him a simple form to fill out and mail back with a cheque for \"the balance in full\" - $13,540.76. As Isaac evidently does not open such mail, what is the chance that the money will be paid off?</p> <p>Another letter is chasing a debt of $88,000 owed by Uri of Miami. The lawyers from New York are making a once-only offer: if he will just put post a cheque for $35,000, the debt will be cleared. This is a 55% discount on the total actually owed. There are other letters for Uri, for other debts running to tens of thousands. One bank is offering to settle for 15 cents on the dollar - a $32,000 debt instantly chopped to barely $5,000. Judging from the letters in the skip, Uri alone owes close to $100,000, yet the people chasing that money seem unable to get him to even open the mail. Multiply Uri by a few million and you begin to understand the seriousness of this meltdown. It is not the kind of story that a generally patriotic American press likes to investigate. But in that one skip, in a small corner of a picture-perfect American city, all the evidence shows repayment claims from banks, car companies, credit-card providers, all turning into so much worthless paper.</p> <p>I stayed in Hollywood for only a week. I came to love the quiet streets where the screech of parrots was often the loudest sound around. The bike lanes were swept clean and the library, a huge building with 24 internet-ready computers, was free to the public. But I left haunted by that pawnshop, the wedding rings, the broken end of the American dream.</p> <p>Even Junior's takings have slumped. \"People come in here and want money. They are not spending anything,\" he says on my last visit. \"Our sales are completely down, except for one thing: golf stuff is selling. It's crazy. The stuff you think people will not want to go out and do! Obviously they are not working, so they go out to the range\".</p>",
  "<p>Toyota's powerful surge to the top of the global automotive industry rankings received a check yesterday when the car maker said net income in the three months to the end of June had tumbled 28%. </p> <p>The Japanese group, which has been running neck-and-neck all year with General Motors in the battle to become the world's biggest car maker, blamed a strengthening yen, rising raw material costs and sluggish markets in the US and western Europe.</p> <p>\"The financial results for this quarter were severe, due to our rapidly changing business environment,\" said Mitsuo Kinoshita, Toyota Motor Corporation's executive vice-president. </p> <p>Overall Toyota reported a 24,000 increase in the number of vehicles sold, to 2.19m. Net income fell to \u00a5353.5bn (\u00a31.7bn) from a record \u00a5491.5 bn in the same period last year. In North America, Toyota said sales in the quarter had fallen by 33,000 to 729,000. Toyota said it lifted its market share to 17.4%, but admitted it had been hurt by the market slowdown, a shift from higher value trucks to lower margin compact cars, higher bad debts and an increase in sales incentives.</p> <p>Toyota said it would \"take swift action in accordance with market changes by increasing the supply of models in high demand and launching new models\".</p> <p>Toyota reported higher sales in Japan, Australia and the Middle East as well as Russia and eastern Europe, but was affected by the slowdown in western Europe.</p> <p>The company said that it expected sales for its fiscal year, which runs to the end of March 2009, would be 8.7m vehicles. </p> <p>In a further sign of the pressure facing motor manufacturers, General Motors has asked its advertising agencies to share in its pain by cutting their fees for campaigns to lure car buyers into showrooms.</p> <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that GM has demanded price cuts of a fifth which would yield savings of more than $20m (\u00a310.2m) but could mean job losses at agencies such as McCann Erickson and Campbell-Ewald.</p> <p>A GM spokeswoman declined to comment on the size of the requested reductions but said: \"We have asked our advertising partners to work with us to eliminate low value work and to find creative solutions to go to market more efficiently.\"</p> <p>GM promotes brands such as Cadillac, Chevrolet and Hummer through advertising campaigns. The Detroit-based carmaker lost $15.5bn in the second quarter and its shares are trading at rock-bottom prices last seen in the 1950s. On Tuesday, the carmaker's board felt obliged to issue a statement affirming its confidence in its chief executive, Rick Wagoner.</p> <p>On a brighter note, BMW posted a 2.2% rise in group sales last month, helped by strong demand for the 1-Series coupe and cabrio as well as the full-size X5 and X6 offroaders. Sales of BMW's British made Mini rose 2.1% in July and are more than 15% up on the year to date. The Rolls-Royce division also reported strong growth, with more than 102 Phantoms being delivered in July, up by a fifth on the same month in 2007. In the first seven months of the year, overall deliveries of BMW marques rose by 4.4% to 890,699 vehicles.</p>",
  "<p>The artist Bartolomeu Cid dos Santos, who has died aged 76, first came to Britain in 1956 \"as a way of escaping the oppressive cultural desert that was then-fascist Portugal, where, as someone once said, 'What was not allowed was forbidden,' ideas included.\" London offered an environment where speech was free, where his teachers at the Slade School of Art were not his enemies, and where he could express his radical beliefs without risking imprisonment. Much of the rest of Dos Santos's life and career were divided between London and Portugal, where he was considered one of the country's major artists.</p> <p>He was immensely well-read, and his greatest work is the etched limestone panels he created for the murals in the atrium of the Lisbon underground station serving Portugal's National Library. The central section, covering 1,000 sq m, depicts an immense library containing the country's finest literature.</p> <p>Dos Santos was born in Lisbon into a family of doctors and art collectors. His grandfather took the young Barto around the galleries and museums of western Europe. Initially schooled in Strasbourg, from 1950 to 1956, Dos Santos studied at the Escola de Belas-Artes in Lisbon, where there was no library and discussion was discouraged. A book, Charme de Londres, with images by the Swiss photographer Isis, inspired him to move there. On the basis of a few watercolours and drawings, he was accepted at the Slade. His interview was conducted by Sir William Coldstream who, years later, said to him, \"I didn't understand a word you were saying when I interviewed you,\" to which Dos Santos replied, \"Neither did I understand your English.\" </p> <p>At the Slade neither of the two dominant styles of painting - one derived from David Bomberg, the other from the more cerebral Euston Road school - was sympathetic to his own ideas. However, his tutor, William Townsend, introduced him to the etcher Anthony Gross, who had studied in Paris and Madrid, had an understanding of European culture, and introduced Dos Santos to Goya's prints. The blackness - both literal and figurative - of Goya's etchings profoundly affected Dos Santos, who realised that the photographs of London by Isis which had initially excited him were not totally alien to Goya's vision. London, although still ravaged by wartime bombing, fascinated him, but he remained captivated by Lisbon, \"a Latin city of Mediterranean character ... which made me look introspectively into a more private, metaphysical world dominated by light, shadows and silences. These two parallel and apparently contradictory approaches have since then pervaded all my work.\"</p> <p>Primarily, Dos Santos was a printmaker, employing a combination of etching and aquatint (a process that he taught to fellow Portuguese artist Paula Rego). During the 1960s, when Portugal was in the midst of its colonial wars, he created a series of prints of bishops - petrified cadavers surveying putrefying ruins of its decaying empire. In the context of the time it was considered dangerously subversive. Later prints were full of rats triumphant in a world grown fat on its own pestilence. </p> <p>Between 1961 and 1996 Dos Santos taught printmaking at the Slade, eventually being elected a fellow of University College London and in 1996 emeritus professor in fine art of the University of London. A man of great charm, he was revered as a teacher and his MA course at the Slade attracted an international body of students. He believed that they should have as broad an education as possible - a trip to the British Museum was a vital part of their training. He held a number of visiting professorships abroad, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers in 1990.</p> <p>Dos Santos held 84 one-man shows in Europe, the far east and the Americas. Examples of his work can be found all over the world including the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert, Cambridge, the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris, the Museum of Modern Art, New York and the Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon. His murals include a chapel at S\u00e3o Pedro de Muel in Portugal and railway stations at Reboleira and Pragal, near Lisbon. Dos Santos also conceived and decorated the commemorative monument to Portugal's 1974 revolution in Gr\u00e3ndola. </p> <p>Dos Santos married twice: firstly to Susan Plant, by whom he had three daughters, and secondly to Fernanda Paix\u00e3o, all of whom survive him. An extrovert and optimist, Barto was a big man who, each year, on August 24 - a day in Portugal when traditionally the devil is said to walk abroad - held a birthday party in Sintra, where he had his Portuguese home. At its centre was a vast refectory table he had shipped out from University College for his friends to sit around, eat, drink and talk.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bartolomeu Cid dos Santos, artist and teacher, born August 24 1931; died May 21 2008</p>",
  "<p>There is a one in 17,000 chance of being born with epidermolysis bullosa. That statistic could make you feel special or unique, but it makes me feel a bit unlucky, because it is one of the most painful disabilities to have. I was born with EB in 1985, and there is no cure for it yet. It is a rare genetic condition where the skin and internal body linings blister at the slightest knock or rub, causing painful, open wounds. Neither of my parents had the condition, as they carried the gene recessively. </p> <p>Imagine a constant pain all over - a pain you are used to because it is all you have known, and you have it with you all the time, kind of like a friend. Parents of babies and children with EB can't hug them as they would like, as they would tear and damage their skin, and growing up with the difficulties the condition brings is hard. There is always some ache or twinge, and being entirely comfortable is a treat. Ordinary painkillers do very little, so many sufferers rely on stronger stuff such as morphine to help them cope with dressing changes, treatments and so on.</p> <p>Rough physical contact when I was a child was always a hazard, but school days were fun in other ways. Going into the \"big yard\" at primary school one lunch time, I got a football in the face, which made me phobic of all balls. As sports were a no-no, I read, used Play-Doh (which improves the dexterity of young EB sufferers) and was allocated a smaller play yard where ball games were banned and friends understood that they needed to be careful with me. But truly, my main passion started in the classroom when we got our first Apple Macintosh computer. I had never seen or used a computer before, but the teachers let me have a go, and I fell in love with technology. Today, I am a dabbler in gadgets, saving up for whatever shiny new tech takes my fancy. I am the go-to gal for computer problems and new mobile phone recommendations. But my flair for hardware is not without pitfalls. Buttons on remotes and phones can feel like pressing pebbles, switches can be tricky, and some handheld devices can be difficult. When playing Mario Galaxy on my Nintendo Wii, I hold the nunchuck between my left hand and knee, which makes me flail like a tangled puppet.</p> <p>Starting secondary school can bring on a fresh challenge for children with EB - a bigger and new environment, increased workload, and hundreds of people who don't know about your condition. Making friends and getting to know people can be difficult. You wonder if your condition puts them off from talking to you, and detaches you from the rest of the group, or perhaps you might not feel confident enough to talk to others in the first place. </p> <p>My mother died from cancer a few months before I started secondary school, which left me feeling uneasy and confused. A few years into secondary school I attended one of the discos. Why I went, I don't really know; I sat at the side. Nicky, a student from my form, sat next to me, and she too found the whole thing tiresome. We found ourselves laughing at the ridiculousness of it all. I had made a new friend, and I soon felt more confident.</p> <p>I had non-teaching assistants throughout school and college, and they helped me cope - opening doors, carrying bags and equipment, and writing. While I was at college, I decided I wanted to go to university. In recent years, because disabled support has improved, more smart and talented EB adults can now consider higher education. Some take the brave choice to move away from home, and then have carers help them with medical and domestic needs. Transport is a huge issue, as buses, tubes and trams can be busy and bumpy, and are best avoided. </p> <p>I was not ready to move from home, so I chose a university close to my home town of Rotherham. I got into Sheffield Hallam University to study media and journalism, and I went to lectures by taxi. At first, I thought I would need an assistant as I always had previously at school and college, but the environment was different. I was able to move around independently, and I would only carry with me what I needed. I also made another great friend, Charlie, whom I met on my nervous first day. She helped me if I felt tired, and listened to me moan if I didn't understand media theory.</p> <p>For people with EB, surgery on the hands is necessary every few years. The condition of the hands deteriorates, and the fingers no longer remain separate and straight, so surgery is required to improve the dexterity, and keep the fingers apart. A skin graft is taken from elsewhere on the body if available. This means trips to the hospital for many operations. As a child, I once had my hands operated on a couple of weeks before Christmas at Great Ormond Street Hospital, in London. I was not a cheery girl on Christmas morning, unable to open anything, with both hands bandaged. I cannot remember how I ate Christmas dinner that year.</p> <p>EB affects the sufferers internally, as well as their skin. While it is difficult enough to absorb any nutrition to grow, as it all goes to waste trying in vain to help the skin heal, problems with swallowing can make mealtimes hard. Many EB sufferers have a tube from their stomach that enables them to have nutritional feeds pumped into them overnight. I was given the option of having one of these tubes when I was younger but I declined, choosing instead to work hard, and eat all I could. I believe it was the right choice for me, as I love food, and there's nothing I like better than a good meal. Moving to London has meant that there is a whole world of food for me to explore. It's something I can get great pleasure out of, like anyone else.</p> <p>Because people with EB have difficulty getting enough nourishment, they can often be tired and anaemic, and need to take iron supplements or have infusions every so often. If someone has had a stressful time, been ill, or simply become weary because of extreme temperatures - summer can be particularly bad, as being covered in bandages does not help in keeping cool - blood transfusions or iron infusions are needed to perk them up, and the difference is briefly noticeable; you sleep and wake better, you have more energy, and you can walk more. My father recalls that, when I was little, I said I felt like skipping out of the hospital after an iron infusion. </p> <p>Because moving can be difficult, comfortable, stretchy clothes are necessary, and finding shoes is a task to dread. Cruel to myself, I swoon over mary-janes, wedges and all pretty, ladylike (and not-so-ladylike) shoes. Despite being limited in what I can wear, I love to browse stores, and unless I am having a particularly off-day, shopping is one of the few things I can do pretty well.</p> <p>While EB is a cruel condition that never gives the sufferer a break, the rippling effects of the condition touch the whole family. Parents and siblings transform into carers and nurses. Holidays take major planning, if they can be taken at all, as travel, particularly long-haul, is uncomfortable. Frequent hospital appointments with different departments that require endless examinations and tests are tiring and soul-destroying. The hours taken at home to change dressings cloud over the rest of the day, and leave you drained, emotionally and physically. The parent of a child or adult who has this condition feels sadness, and also a twinge of guilt in helping them in this pain-inflicting routine. As the individual with the condition, you feel bad - on top of the physical pain - that your parent or carer has to endure it with you, and that the burden is shared out to people you love. </p> <p>The same can be said for friends. EB tries hard to strip enjoyment out of whatever it can. Plans for days or evenings out are scuppered if you are having a particularly painful time, and some things, such as long walks or theme parks with rough rides, are out of the question. The combination of wanting to do the things everyone else can do, and the feeling of letting people down by not being able to join in, leaves a sad, heavy feeling inside.</p> <p>After hard times like those, I find it important to switch off and relax, just to separate myself from anything unpleasant I have felt. Everyone is different, and while it is technology and chocolate that helps me unwind, the hobbies and interests of others with EB are varied, from animals, cars or watching football, to meteorology. For EB sufferers, it is their passions and strong wills that keep them going.</p> <p>Today, I am living independently, enjoying what London has to offer. I have carers who visit me, help me get ready for the day and wind down in the evening. They help with any medical and dressing needs, and they clean my flat and do any other chores or cooking I require. I barely have a free week, with friends and family making good use of my sofa bed, to stay and enjoy the city with me. One of my favourite things to do is to stroll around Russell Square with my dad when he visits. I have friends here, and I am getting to know lots of people in my area, and establishing my local haunts. </p> <p>Sometimes I am asked what would be the first thing I would do if I became completely cured, be it through a medical advance or miracle. I always imagine the same thing. I go shopping, either with my friend Nicky or my sister Sally, and I can finally try on those shoes, or that skirt that won't reveal bandages any more. I would build up my energy and stamina, and walk everywhere around London. I would take up cooking lessons and some kind of physical activity - swimming, dancing, sumo wrestling, whatever. With a to-do list like that, I am optimistic and hopeful things will heal for real, some day.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday August 9 2008</strong></p> <p> Some confusion has arisen over our account of Neanderthals, which said at one point that they are thought to have died out 30,000 years ago, but at another that this happened 40,000 years ago. Our correspondent's best judgment now is that they disappeared somewhere between these two dates. As to their height, which has also been disputed, that seems usually to have been between 5ft 4in and 5ft 7in.</p> <p> </p> <p>Strands of DNA recovered from the fossilised leg bone of a Neanderthal have shed light on the fragility of the ancient population and pinpointed when they first split from what were to become modern humans. The 38,000-year-old bone was unearthed in a cave in Vindija in Croatia, and has since become part of a landmark project to read the entire genetic sequence of an ancient human ancestor, a feat scientists believe will help reveal how modern humans evolved into the world's dominant species.</p> <p>Researchers at the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, read the complete sequence of DNA held in tiny biological powerhouses called mitochondria, which provide energy for cells. The mitochondria are only passed down the female line, so can be used to trace the species back to an ancestral \"Eve\", the mother of all Neanderthals. The team analysed the DNA of 13 genes from the Neanderthal mitochondria and found they were distinctly different to modern humans, suggesting Neanderthals never, or rarely, interbred with early humans. The genetic material shows that a Neanderthal \"Eve\" lived around 660,000 years ago, when the species last shared a common ancestor with humans.</p> <p>Further tests on the DNA revealed surprisingly few evolutionary changes, which suggests that the Neanderthals may only ever have existed in relatively small numbers, with less than 10,000 alive at any one time.</p> <p>\"This has implications for our picture of Neanderthals and perhaps the reasons for their extinction. If the population was teetering on the brink for hundreds of thousands of years, it maybe changes our impression of what it would have taken to make them go extinct rather than if there were millions of them,\" said Adrian Briggs, a molecular biologist who co-authored a report on the work in the journal Cell.</p> <p>Theories of what drove the Neanderthals to extinction range from an inability to adapt to a quickly changing environment, to genocide by early humans. The species is though to have died out in Europe around 30,000 years ago, shortly after the arrival of early humans.</p> <p>Neanderthals were short and stocky and well adapted to a cold climate. The tallest male, found in a cave in France, was only 5ft 5in (1.71m). Despite having barrel chests, strong ridges above their eyes and a lack of chins, their brains were on average larger than those of modern humans. Some fossil evidence suggests that they were occasional cannibals, though more commonly hunted large animals including horses and mammoths. Remains of Neanderthals dating back 400,000 years suggest they crafted tools and weapons and buried their dead. The last Neanderthals died out nearly 40,000 years ago, as Homo sapiens migrated to, and eventually settled throughout, Europe.</p> <p>The Leipzig team has read 4% of the Neanderthal's entire genetic code and hopes to complete the full sequence by the end of the year. Comparing the Neanderthal genome with the human genetic sequence should highlight subtle genetic differences, such as genes for improved brain capacity and other traits that underpin what it means to be human.</p>",
  "<p>Climate scientists have issued a fresh warning over the future risk of flooding after research showed heavy rainstorms are likely to become even more intense than predicted.</p> <p>Rainfall is expected to increase with global warming because the atmosphere can hold more water as it heats up, but the extent to which rainfall patterns will change in the future has been unclear.</p> <p>Writing in the US journal Science, researchers warn regions that are already vulnerable to flooding will be hit hardest by rainstorms in the future, and that previous predictions may have underestimated how intense these rainstorms will be.</p> <p>Researchers from Reading and Miami Universities used satellite data from 1987 to 2004 to see how natural changes in surface and air temperatures caused by El Ni\u00f1o weather events influenced rainfall over the tropics. They found a clear link, with countries experiencing far more rainfall as temperatures rose.</p> <p>\"When we first looked, we saw that the warm periods were associated with the periods of heaviest rainfall, but when we looked more carefully, we found the models underestimated what the satellite data showed by a factor of two to three,\" said Richard Allan, who led the study.</p> <p>If other researchers are able to confirm the findings, it suggests areas already prone to flooding may experience far more problems as global temperatures rise.</p> <p>Yesterday one of the government's chief science advisers, Robert Watson, said the UK must prepare for a 4C rise in average temperatures, despite Europe's declared goal of no more than a 2C rise.</p>",
  "<p>&#xa0;</p> <p>Has George Monbiot sold out on his environmental credentials or is he suffering from amnesia? In his article on these pages last Tuesday he states that he has now reached the point where he no longer cares whether or not the answer to climate change is nuclear - let it happen, he says.</p> <p>Has he not read the evidence presented by environmentalists such as Tony Benn and me at the Windscale, Sizewell and Hinckley Point public inquiries? Is he unaware that nuclear-power generated electricity is the most expensive form of energy - 400% more expensive than coal - or that it received \u00a36bn in subsidies, with \u00a370bn to be paid by taxpayers in decommissioning costs? Is he unaware that there is no known way of disposing of nuclear waste, which will contaminate the planet for thousands of years? Has he forgotten the nuclear disasters at Windscale, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl?</p> <p>We are facing an economic and political crisis on a scale similar to the Wall Street crash in 1929, the mass unemployment which affected the UK and Europe in the 1930s and the energy crisis in the early 70s.</p> <p>We are facing a monumental energy crisis, yet we live on an island with more than 1,000 years of coal reserves from which we can provide all the electricity, oil, gas and petrochemicals that people need, without causing harm to the environment. Britain - despite its massive indigenous deep-mine coal reserves - has never had an integrated energy policy based on coal and renewables, and as a consequence we are now facing the worst energy crisis in our history.</p> <p>Since the end of the second world war, both Labour and Tory governments have sought to replace Britain's vast coal reserves with a false promise of \"cheap\" imported oil, \"cheap, safe\" nuclear energy and \"cheap\" natural gas - policies that have not only cost the British people billions of pounds, but resulted in the near-extinction of Britain's deep-mine coal industry, the virtual exhaustion of North Sea gas and oil, and massive economic costs and environmental problems associated with nuclear power.</p> <p>After the closure of 192 pits since 1980, the loss of 170,000 jobs and the closure or non-operation of nearly 70% of coal-fired power stations on the false premise that they were uneconomic and the worst polluter of carbon dioxide, it is reasonable to expect that there would have been a dramatic fall in CO2 emissions. But in fact CO2 emissions have actually increased - not that surprising, since more than 80% of CO2 emissions are produced by oil and gas from power stations, road transport, industry, shipping and domestic use. That fact alone should cause Monbiot to rethink.</p> <p>Britain needs an integrated energy policy that will produce 250m tonnes of indigenous deep-mine clean coal per year - from which could be extracted all the electricity, oil, gas and petrochemicals that our people need.</p> <p>All existing and new coal-fired power stations should be fitted with clean coal technology - including carbon capture that would remove all CO2 - and at the same time we should be developing a massive renewable energy policy based on wind, wave, tide, barrage, hydro, geothermal, solar power, together with insulation, conservation and reforestation.</p> <p>We must end the import of coal, (currently 43m tonnes a year) which is produced by subsidies, \"slave labour\" and child labour, and end the import of shale oil, tar sands and other so-called unconventional oils, which are the dirtiest fuels on the planet but are being used to produce electricity.</p> <p>We still do not know - because of the security and secrecy laws - the full extent of the disaster at Windscale (Sellafield) in 1957 or Three Mile Island in the US in 1979, but we do know that the incidence of cancer and leukaemia - particularly among children - is 10% higher in or around nuclear power stations, and we know from experts such as Robert Gale - who treated the victims at Chernobyl in 1986 - that more than 100,000 will die over a 30-year period.</p> <p>We need an end to all nuclear-powered electricity generation, the most dangerous and uneconomic method of producing electricity. We need an end to deforestation, which is the cause of 20% of CO2 emissions worldwide, and an end to biofuel development - which not only produces substantial CO2 emissions but is causing mass starvation and higher food prices throughout the world.</p> <p>Only by the introduction of a real integrated energy policy based on clean coal technology and renewable energies, can we begin to meet the needs of people in the UK and throughout the world.</p> <p>I challenge George Monbiot to test out which is the most dangerous fuel - coal or nuclear power. I am prepared to go into a room full of CO2 for two minutes, if he is prepared to go into a room full of radiation for two minutes.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Arthur Scargill is the leader of the Socialist Labour party.

  "<p>The air was muggy, and a haze hung over Beijing as if it was yet to wake up, although it was midday. I had decided months before that I would be there for the opening ceremony of the Olympics, and share the excitement. But as I drove in from the airport there were no welcome banners, no colourful flags on the lampposts, no billboards or Olympic posters. It was only three weeks till the big day, after seven years of waiting and meticulous preparations. It was to be the \"dream of a century\" for the Chinese. But the atmosphere was dead. </p> <p>The fast lane of the airport expressway and all the ring roads were marked with the five circles of the Olympic symbol. No cars dared to enter them. The traffic moved unusually freely, as half the city's 3.2m cars have been taken off the road to reduce congestion and help clean up the air. There were few foreign tourists either; the air hostess told me on the way over that Air China flights were being cut back as visas had been drastically restricted to keep out potential troublemakers. I got home in record time.</p> <p>I was startled to see a police car parked outside my apartment complex, and two volunteers in blue and white torch-bearer T-shirts standing at the crossroads. The porter was in military khaki. Instead of greeting me as he usually did, he demanded proof of my residence. I asked him the reason for this change: \"Don't you feel safer?\" he asked. </p> <p>Later I popped out to get the local papers and magazines, and they were full of alarm, bombs in Kunming, suspicious white powder on a plane, anti-aircraft missiles being installed by the Bird's Nest stadium ready for any attack. There were to be security checks on the Beijing underground, and checkpoints at frequent intervals on the highways into the city. \"Even if they dare to commit any crime during the Olympics, they won't be able to escape easily,\" the Beijing Evening News said. Where was the joy, the sense of celebration?</p> <p>I had last been here in early March, just before the demonstrations in Tibet and the violence at the torch relay around the world. The mood was boisterous then, with eager anticipation as the giant clock ticked away on Tiananmen Square counting down to the start. \"Give us 16 days of Olympics, and be rewarded with 5,000 years of our civilisation,\" was a slogan I remembered well. The only questions were: would the stadium and various other sites be finished on time, what about the traffic jams, how could the visitors be made to feel at home, would Chinese athletes collect more golds than America? Above all, how could our Olympic games become the most successful, the most memorable in history?</p> <p>Now the Olympics are here, but the buzz has gone. The only tangible reminder of it has been the torch relay inside China, in which the rest of the world was scarcely interested. Even that was highly staged, with a very visible police and security presence. The commentators on China Central Television even told their audiences to sit at home and watch it on television. A subdued nervousness permeates Beijing.</p> <p>Critics say the Chinese government is exaggerating the terror risk to extend its control. But is it really necessary to have this high security, I asked a Chinese friend, who is not very patriotic. \"Yes,\" she said. \"It is all the foreign devils. Better to have a safe games than a farce like the torch relays in London, Paris, and San Francisco. It was such a loss of face. We don't want it here on our soil.\" </p> <p>For the government too, the risk seems real. They started with \"One World, One Dream\": they believed that China would be welcomed on to the world stage and galvanised frenetic popular support. When the western media protested at the award of the Olympics to China, the government felt it would overcome its critics by dazzling the world with its brilliant display. They failed to appreciate the importance the world would attach to the pledges they had given on the environment, human rights and press freedom. Surely diplomacy means engaging with the world on the world's terms, not just on your terms? </p> <p>Then the protests against the torch relay produced a sea change. Fear of disruption, or worse, hostage-taking and killings like Munich in 1972, took over. The government's new line was only confirmed when 16 policemen were killed in an attack in Xinjiang, in western China, on Monday, just four days before the opening ceremony. A government spokesman said the attackers wanted to \"make 2008 a year of mourning for China\". Now a headline in the Beijing Evening News said it all: \"A safe Olympics is the most important gold medal.\" At any cost, even the jubilation of the whole country. </p> <p>I came back to England. If watching the Olympics on television is now the choice of the Chinese, I thought I would rather do it in London. But then I was overwhelmed by the avalanche of criticism in the British press and TV coverage: \"'Police-state wastes goodwill', says stadium designer\"; \"Beijing Olympics: the spying games\", \"Clegg urges PM: don't endorse these tainted Olympics\", \"Queasy rider - US cyclists combat pollution\", \"Britons arrested for flying pro-Tibet banners\", \"Tiananmen orchestra cannot drown out the chorus of protests\" - and many, many more, ranging from abhorring the \"hideous\" Bird's Nest, to accusations of exploiting the migrant workers who built it. This is not fact-finding but fault-finding. And now, at the eleventh hour, Bush has rasped at China's record on human rights and religious freedom, fanning the flames. </p> <p>China certainly has faults. But reading the papers and watching the news, you might think the country has nothing to take credit for. Do a billion Chinese not deserve their day in the limelight, their moment of rejoicing? The western press seems to equate the Olympics with the Chinese government, not the people - and the people must wonder what they have to do to win some approval.</p> <p>As a Chinese writer and film-maker, I have tried to tell the truth about China - most recently spending a year in Tibet, documenting the lives of ordinary Tibetans, their dreams and their frustrations. I know the problems all too well. But as the writer VS Pritchett once said, the only worthwhile criticism is \"lit with a gleam of sympathy\". The reforms that have produced China's vibrant cities, its new prosperity and new freedoms, only started 30 years ago in 1978. We still have a long way to go. But covering China with nothing but shame is not going to help us get there. As we Chinese say, you don't make a seedling grow faster by pulling it up and stretching it. </p> <p>We can expect more demonstrations in Beijing during the games, especially with the kind of encouragement given by the western press. The Chinese government would do well not to overreact to the protests or the criticism, with 25,000 foreign journalists focusing on them. They should be confident in the knowledge that the majority of the Chinese are behind them, at least on the games. I'm sure it will be a great and memorable - and safe - spectacle. I will be watching it, and so will half the world. But I shall be wishing that my countrymen and women were dancing in the streets.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sun Shuyun is the author of A Year in Tibet, and directed the BBC4 series of the same title <br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"><br>comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Andy Green has the aura of a man given a new lease of life. Last year he was preparing to quit BT after more than 20 years, to spend more time doing charity work, but now he's back running one of the biggest names in British IT.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336326322\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/07/andy220.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Green\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Green, chief executive of Logica. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Logica has gone through a torrid time since its forceful chief executive, Martin Read, who built the company into a major European player during his tenure, was ousted last year by irate shareholders following a spectacular profit warning.</p> <p>At the time, Green, whose short-sleeved shirt he sports in his interview cries out for a techie-style row of pens in the breast pocket, was settling down for his 22nd year at BT before cashing in and working for charities including Shelter.</p> <p>Having been allowed to take BT's ragbag of international assets and spend six years building them into a multibillion-pound international IT business, now called BT Global Services, the 52-year-old had taken a non-operational job as CEO of group strategy and operations as his swansong.</p> <p>The media painted Green as locked in a race with Ian Livingston for the top job at BT in the event of Ben Verwaayen's departure. Green, however, had his own exit strategy. The only problem was, it turned out to be a really bad idea.</p> <p>\"If you examined the BT report and accounts you would have seen that my [share options] packages ... were due to come to fruition all at once in 2009. I had concluded I was going to go and do some charity work and some non-executive things ... but three months into my new role, I realised I hated it and I really wanted to be an operating chief executive, which was a bit unfortunate,\" he chuckles.</p> <p>His fortunes changed when Logica approached him to rescue its shattered reputation with investors, with the incentive of a \u00a33.5m golden hello. He joined in January and in April unveiled his turnaround plan for the business. His idea is to improve the company's sales operation, double its offshore workforce and cut costs, including 1,300 jobs. From next year - which will mark Logica's 40th anniversary - it is supposed to result in market-beating revenue growth, sector-leading margins and thus higher dividends.<br><strong><br>Rocket science</strong></p> <p>Since April, Green has been taking \"The Logica Story\" - a 24-point distillation of the original 82-page presentation made to the City - to the firm's 39,000 employees. The plan itself is hardly rocket science, but the really difficult job will be changing the culture within the company, hence his going around like a door-to-door salesman with his pitch. Green, who grew up in Dorridge in the West Midlands, talks with candour - he booted his PR minder out of the interview, something that few senior businessmen would do these days - and it's a candour that he now needs from the employees he meets.</p> <p>Logica got into trouble last year because its UK business fell off a cliff when a key contract went awry. \"The centre was off buying businesses and they were relying on the margins from the UK to justify the whole thing and there was a lot of pressure in the organisation not to hear bad news,\" he says. </p> <p>Many in the City reckon Read was too domineering. Green demurs: \"Martin has many strengths strategically but I think there was a group of people who just thought: it's too hard to tell Martin this.\"</p> <p>Green has already taken one obvious step towards changing the culture of the company: dumping its long-held and rather moth-eaten London headquarters in favour of a new building in Reading. He has also dropped the CMG suffix from the company's name, a relic of its merger with its Dutch rival CMG in 2002. </p> <p>While the financial fruits of Green's labours will not appear until next year, half-year figures next Thursday should give a sign things are heading in the right direction. </p> <p>\"What we should be able to show in the figures are the milestones: have we built up more people offshore? How have orders been getting on? Have we recruited the people we said we would recruit in our high-growth areas? Do we have the sales people? Shareholders are interested ... mainly because they are looking for a company that says 'we are going to do this' and actually does it.\"</p> <p>His credibility was boosted last month when Logica won a slice of a lucrative contract with the French tyre-maker Michelin, rumoured to be worth \u20ac300m (\u00a3237m) over three years, but investors will be looking for reassurance that the downturn in Europe, where Logica makes 95% of its revenues, has not stalled progress. Results last month from its rivals CapGemini and Atos Origin were strong but suggested weakness in the UK market.</p> <p>Green shows little concern that clients may stop hiring his people. \"As companies face threats, they are increasingly turning to IT solutions to resolve their issues,\" he says. His ambition is to raise the size of Logica's average contract - about \u20ac10m a year - to more like \u20ac50m. So will the firm soon be snapping at the heels of BT? Possibly, but he says: \"I don't expect us to be directly competitive at least for another five years.\"</p> <p>If he succeeds it would be ironic, not least because he never thought he'd get to run BT Global Services at all. He was strategy director under the chief executive Peter Bonfield and chairman Sir Ian Vallance, who presided over a mammoth expansion plan that left the firm with such crippling debts that when the dotcom bubble burst both men got the boot. BT had to launch a \u00a36bn rescue rights issue and hand its mobile phone business - then called Cellnet but since rebranded as O2 - to shareholders for nothing.</p> <p>Green partly owes his survival to the fact that when boom turned to bust he was running BT's internet service provider business, BT Openworld. But he admits he thought he was for the chop when he went to Vallance's successor, Sir Christopher Bland, with his plan to turn the businesses he had bought into an IT services operation. \"It was a real mess and I went to pitch to Bland, assuming I was about to get shot and I think Christopher took me on assuming he was going to shoot me,\" Green remembers. He didn't and in the last three months the business Green created accounted for almost 40% of BT's total revenues of \u00a35.2bn. In contrast, analysts estimate Logica's half year revenues will be about \u00a31.67bn.</p> <p><strong>Buying bricks </strong></p> <p>Despite his new role at Logica, Green still has time for charity work. He is spending part of his summer holiday working with Abesu, a charity he helped found with his brother-in-law after his sister died from cancer in 2005. She had met a woman called Queenie while visiting a niece working for Oxfam in Africa, who was using any spare cash to buy bricks to build a home for her grandchildren. Green's sister always talked of starting a charity to help. With a local women's cooperative, Abesu has built 10 houses in the past year and installed vital infrastructure such as wells in rural Zambia.</p> <p>Green is also a fundraiser for Shelter, among whose trustees is Martin Read. He has been a supporter of the housing charity since he was at Leeds University, for which he dumped a place at Cambridge because its chemical engineering course was a year shorter and he was keen to get into business.</p> <p>\"I'm never quite sure how life would be different if I'd chosen differently,\" he says. \"There are so many accidents in life when you look back at it but I am glad it has turned out the way it has.\"</p> <h2>The CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> September 7 1955</p> <p><strong>Education </strong>King Edward's School, Edgbaston, Birmingham; Leeds University (BSc chemical engineering, first class hons)</p> <p><strong>Career</strong><br><strong>1976-82</strong> Shell, sales representative<br><strong>1982-84</strong> Shell, product manager<br><strong>1984-86</strong> Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, marketing consultant<br><strong>1986-87</strong> BT, manager IT marketing<br><strong>1987-88</strong> BT, general manager national payphone services<br><strong>1988-93</strong> BT, general manager then director network services<br><strong>1993-94</strong> BT, general manager customer services, then director UK customer field services<br><strong>1994-2000</strong> BT, group director strategy and development<br><strong>2000-01</strong> BT Openworld, chief executive<br><strong>2001-07</strong> BT Global Services, chief executive<br><strong>2007</strong> BT, chief executive group strategy and operations<br><strong>2008-</strong> Logica, chief executive</p> <p><strong>Family </strong>Married with three children</p>",
  "<p>It has been called An Inconvenient Truth for the economy. Instead of a former vice-president delivering a cinematic presentation on the perils of climate change, a documentary set for release at the end of this month aims to warn Americans of a different global horror: debt.</p> <p>IOUSA charts the role of debt in pushing the US economy towards the sort of cliffhanger ending beloved of movie makers. Like Al Gore's Oscar-winning documentary, it features an array of talking heads, whizz-bang graphics, pie charts and timelines. And like Gore's movie, it has been met with early acclaim, receiving a standing ovation at this year's Sundance festival.</p> <p>\"It is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in America don't understand what the problems are,\" the director, Patrick Creadon, said. Creadon previously made Wordplay, an acclaimed documentary about crosswords. </p> <p>Instead of Gore, his latest film features a former head of the US government accountability office, David Walker, as well as a supporting cast ranging from financial guru Warren Buffett to comedian Steve Martin. </p> <p>While many are used to living with a national deficit of $9.6tr, the documentary points out that once social security, healthcare and other obligations are accounted for, the debt is closer to $53tr. One estimate is that it rises by $1m every minute.</p> <p>Yet while the film and its makers counsel against debt - the core message is not to spend more than you have - IOUSA itself is the product of debt financing.</p> <p>Made in 2006, its dire warnings of a mortgage crisis and impending recession came true before the documentary was released. As it became necessary to embark on a costly re-editing of the film, it exceeded its $500,000 budget, lost its main financial backer and ended up being financed by a production company set up by a Baltimore financial newsletter.</p> <p>The film will open in 10 cities across the country on August 21. </p> <p>Whether moviegoers seeking escapism will flock to a film advertised by a poster bearing the image of a shuttered White House under the slogan \"For Sale. Foreclosure. Inquire within\" remains to be seen.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday August 11 2008.

  "<p>Smetana's The Two Widows is one of those fragile, rarefied gems of operatic literature that are treasured by people who collect such delights, but is otherwise little known outside the Czech Republic. All the more extraordinary, then, that Scottish Opera is poised to produce its second production of this piece within 40 years. I know because I directed the first, back in the 1970s - a co-production with another opera-collector's haven, the Wexford festival. </p> <p>The origins of the work are unique in Smetana's oeuvre. It derives from a relatively conventional French vaudeville by Jean Pierre F\u00e9licien Mallefille - eschewing for once both Smetana's traditional location in the Czech countryside and subject matter linked to Czech rural customs or ancient myths and traditions. In other words, for this opera Smetana separated himself from the apparatus of \"nationalism\" and chose subject matter that allowed him to concentrate on the intimate nuances of personal relationships - an area for which his heartfelt and subtle music was ideally suited. </p> <p>The issue of nationalism in opera has become an almost incomprehensible constellation of ideas and political emotions for modern ears. But in the age of empire it was through opera that struggling ethnic groups sought to establish and legitimise their identities. Under the Hapsburgs Hungarians, Czechs and Romanians all sought to establish their language and their individual ethnic cultures by representing them in opera. The Khedive of Egypt's commission of an opera from Verdi on an Egyptian subject was the crowning and most absurd example, though the result - Aida - was sublime. The construction of the Narodni Divadlo (National Theatre) in Prague - a gloriously imperial gold-leafed edifice that now seems identical to every other haute bourgeois temple of culture - was in fact an impassioned gesture of political independence, made possible by public subscription, and bore over its proscenium the words: N\u00e1rod Sob\u0115 - meaning a gift from the people to themselves. Nationalism, it is curious now to remember, was then a movement of the left, so that when Wagner wore his German beret it was a statement of radical leftwing nationalism, for which he was driven into exile.</p> <p>Prague in Smetana's time was a majority German-speaking city, and even had its own German opera house; the issue of the Czech language was controversial, just as it was in other imperial/ethnic conflicts, not least in Scotland where the Gaelic language and highland dress were likewise initially outlawed and subsequently \"sanitised\" - partially by the Anglo-German royal family.</p> <p>Smetana became the avowed embodiment in music of Czech national aspiration, to the absurd extent that musical taste divided between the apparently pure Czech Smetana and the Germanically corrupted Dvo\u0155\u0103k. </p> <p>The truth, however, was much more muddled. Smetana's first language was actually German, and he had to learn Czech specifically to be able to compose in that language - his early attempts were full of mistakes. Even more embarrassing was the fact that the librettist of The Bartered Bride - the piece that established Smetana's nationalist credentials - subsequently turned out to be a Hapsburg informer, though realist observers of the Czech political scene would know that almost nobody could expect to be successful in Czech society without collaborating with, initially, the Hapsburgs or, later, the Russians. Purity of political conscience is decidedly a luxury in a country that has endured over 300 years of almost unbroken occupation by others. </p> <p>Perhaps that explains the core of Smetana's music, which has little to do with political aspirations, but a lot to do with the secret working out of intimate problems, particularly problems to do with the repression of intimate feelings.</p> <p>The Two Widows belongs to a genre of Smetana's theatre works where a relatively simple plot is used as a vehicle for the exploration of the expression of repressed inner feelings. In this, there is a definite relationship between his comedies and Shakespeare's romances, and it is no accident that at the end of his life Smetana was working on a setting of Twelfth Night, to be called Viola. The romances, too, work on the basis that an emotional journey is the key to redemption, usually into some kind of hostile or asocial environment - in both A Midsummer Night's Dream and Love's Labour's Lost it is a \"wilderness\" or \"forest\" - not romantic destinations in Shakespeare's universe, but hostile, strange environments that nonetheless, by their very strangeness, stimulate the resolution of the emotional problems that remain locked up in normal social life. </p> <p>In Smetana's The Kiss, the characters are abandoned in the semi-criminal world of the forest to find their true emotional personalities; in The Secret it is a journey through a dark and secret tunnel that achieves the same object. In The Devil's Wall it is literally the bursting of a satanic dam that brings about resolution. The pitfalls placed in the path towards marriage and emotional fulfilment are, of course, the essential subject of comedy. </p> <p>In The Two Widows, Smetana does away with the need for such symbolic devices, and instead concentrates his psychologically apt and penetrating musical insights on the excruciating inability of human beings to communicate their most important feelings to each other. The humanity with which he observes Aneska and Ladislav's struggle to relate to one another is perhaps sharpened by the evident fragility of the plot that surrounds them. It is wafer-thin, but then this is no melodrama, but a touching comedy of everyday human emotional limitation, told with gentle humour and considerable compassion. No wonder that Richard Strauss, also a fond observer of the emotional frailties of women in particular, often expressed his love for this work. Strauss would also have appreciated, as an experienced theatre man, that the surrounding characters, though trivial, are deftly and expertly characterised, providing a frame of people who apparently find it easy to be happy - the \"gay\" sister Karolina and the two charming peasant lovers who come dancing in from some Czech operetta, as well as the conventional grumbling bass character, the gamekeeper Mumlal. </p> <p>The atmosphere is kept light, but the faint shadow of melancholy and loneliness is beautifully preserved to enhance our feeling of relief and shared happiness when the dam is finally broken. It takes a grumpy spirit indeed to remain immune to the delicate charm and particularly Bohemian note of sadness and lost opportunity that Smetana contrives. </p> <p>And this is, I suspect, is Smetana's natural world, rather than the assertive nationalist and historical label he was obliged to live up to. The Hapsburg monarchy is not a repressive state to be compared in any way with the communists, but nonetheless there is an evident element of personal repression in any situation of political occupation. This is the state of mind so brilliantly revealed in Orlando Figes' book The Whisperers, where repression enters every word of every intimate breakfast conversation. Perhaps Smetana's subtle depiction of lamed emotional interaction was also his way of summing up the personal consequences of an occupied society. There is, after all, some evidence of the potential negative consequences of this \"dam\" by observing the astounding outburst of creativity from Smetana's successor, Jan\u0103\u010dek, for whom the establishment of an independent Czech state was enough to inspire a lifetime of masterpieces in a bare decade. </p> <p>I am charmed to think that opera-goers in Scotland will once again have the chance to experience Smetana's gentle but touching minor masterpiece, and hope they may emerge into the bawdy Edinburgh night with a wry little smile on their lips, and an ephemeral tear in their eye.</p>",
  "<p>Beijing's final Foreign Language Activity Week took place in May. In the aftermath of the Sichuan earthquake, the activities were more sombre than the organisers had anticipated, but at the opening ceremony held in Chaoyang Park officials quietly declaimed their achievements. Five and a half million Beijingers could now speak a foreign language, up from just 3.2 million at the end of 2006, they said.</p> <p>The man behind it all is Liu Yang, the head of the Beijing Speaks Foreign Languages Committee, which was founded eight years ago and entrusted with the task of \"creating a good linguistic environment\" for the Olympic games.</p> <p>By the end of last year, the committee had organised six English language \"park celebrations\", 701 \"neighbourhood study spots\" and 433 \"English corners\" in which local students practised rote-learned phrases with one another. They staged foreign song contests, public speaking competitions and free tuition. </p> <p>The idea, said Liu, was to turn Beijing into the \"international city\" it was always supposed to be. Although the campaign was spurred on by the Olympic games, efforts would proceed well beyond 2008.</p> <p>The committee also helped to organise a foreign teacher recruitment drive. However, tough visa restrictions in the run-up to the games appear to have stifled those efforts. </p> <p>The Olympics won't create miracles, but enthusiasm is half the battle. The 17-day sporting extravaganza represents the culmination of three decades of Chinese efforts to reconnect with the world, and enthusiasm continues to run high. </p> <p>After the revolution of 1949, Esperanto was the ideal and Russian was positively encouraged, but English belonged to the imperialists. According to Bob Adamson, an expert with the Hong Kong Institute of Education, English was \"viewed by some national leaders as a useful tool for the development of the economy but a negative force culturally and politically.\"</p> <p>It was put back on the curriculum in the mid-50s, but students would be trained in a Pavlovian manner to recite slogans castigating US foreign policies and proclaiming the inevitable victory of the proletariat. Even Chairman Mao used to study English from the translations of President Liu Shaoqi's speeches. It was hardly the language of the Olympiad.</p> <p>Long before the Olympic torch was even a twinkle in the eye of China's leaders, learning English was already high on the agenda. The forces that have driven the country to the brink of its biggest international event in history have also driven its people to embrace English, the lingua franca of global culture and commerce. The education system, at least in the cities, has followed the economy along the capitalist road. </p> <p>But Liu has sought to target the sort of people who wouldn't know their Tefl from their elbow. Among them are the cabbies, who remain the most likely to find themselves in the company of foreigners during a 4km snarl-up on the Third Ring Road. </p> <p>Taxi driver Guo Jingsheng has already been given a special permit to wait outside Beijing's spanking new Olympic media centre to pick up any one of the several thousand bewildered foreign journalists here to report on the games.</p> <p>\"I can understand some English, but I respond pretty slowly,\" Guo said. \"I don't have much time to study. I think it is harder for Beijing people.\"</p> <p>At least as far as foreign languages are concerned, Beijing has fallen considerably behind the more cosmopolitan Shanghai. Although local polyglots were routinely arrested during the Cultural Revolution, Shanghai's attitude to foreign languages has rarely been hobbled by political prejudices. Its residents are more amenable to new phrasings: they have had to learn Mandarin on top of their own \u2014 rather distinct \u2014 local dialect.</p> <p>Beijing, on the other hand, is a city of monoglots. Even the Beijing accent \u2014 full of drawling elisions \u2014 seems to confound attempts to learn another tongue.</p> <p>It isn't that Guo hasn't been trying. His employer has been offering voluntary evening classes over the past year, and he has been attending when he can. </p> <p>\"They are not forcing us to do it. Most of us just want to do our bit and make some money. Learning English is a good thing to do anyway.\"</p> <p>Now in his 50s, Guo is a member of the lost generation. During the Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966, English classes were cancelled. In 1972, when they were begrudgingly reintroduced in the wake of Nixon's detente, Guo's textbooks would have been filled with passages about English being a tool of the class struggle.</p> <p>You still find people, in their late 50s, who know the English words for \"hammer\" and \"sickle\" but very little else. The former might finally have some use at one Olympic event. </p> <p>In recent weeks the press has been packed with stories about patriotic senior citizens, chefs and police officers learning their ABCs in the hope that they can do their bit for the games. Sixty-eight-year-old Auntie Ma told local reporters that learning English made her feel younger. Others said that they just wanted to help out. </p> <p>Liu is also a senior watchdog in the city's efforts to eliminate \"Chinglish\". The campaign has sought to remove anything that draws attention to the fact that Beijing is not really used to foreign company. The committee's website has avoided any potential embarrassment by remaining entirely in Chinese. </p> <p>Already the more notorious solecisms on menus, street signs and government leaflets \u2014 the staple of countless amused blogs and travelogs \u2014 have been replaced with standardised translations. There is still much work to do. In an online test, volunteers are asked to choose between \"staff only\" and \"client stop!\", and \"emergency exit\" and \"emergency out\". </p> <p>Chinglish, it seems, draws unwelcome attention to the sort of cultural rifts that the Olympic games were designed to smooth over. Foreigners will perhaps be disappointed by the elimination of gems like \"racist park\" or \"Careful Landslip Attention Security\". But above all else, Beijing wants to be taken seriously.</p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England left interest rates on hold at 5% yesterday as it battles the twin risks of spiralling inflation and the possibility of the UK entering recession for the first time since the early 1990s.</p> <p>Despite the mounting pile of gloomy data and pleas from hard-pressed businesses and households to cut rates, the prospect of inflation soaring to 5% has left the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) with little room for manoeuvre.</p> <p>Inflation is at a 10-year high of 3.8% - almost double the government's official target of 2% - and the Bank's governor, Mervyn King, has already had to write one letter to the chancellor this year explaining why inflation had exceeded its target. A leading thinktank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said last month that it expected King would have to write at least three more letters this year.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at the consultancy Global Insight, said: \"We believe the Bank of England really had little option [other than] to keep interest rates at 5%. </p> <p>\"The ever-growing likelihood of recession calls for lower interest rates, yet this is precluded by elevated inflation levels and risks. Elevated inflation levels and risks call for higher interest rates, yet this would increase the danger of a deeper, extended recession. Best therefore to sit tight for the time being. Nevertheless, there could well have been a three-way split in the vote again.\"</p> <p>The MPC was widely expected to keep rates on hold, but the committee will almost certainly have discussed a possibility of a rate rise as it did last month when committee member Tim Besley voted for an increase. Several analysts believe that he voted this way again yesterday and that other hawkish members may have joined him.</p> <p>However, the dovish member David Blanchflower is expected to have urged a cut in rates. He told the Guardian last month that the UK could be in for a worse time than the US if the Bank did not start to cut rates. \"I think we are going into recession and we are probably in one right now. It's not too late to stop it but we have to act right now,\" he said. \"Monetary policy has been far too tight for too long.\"</p> <p>The European Central Bank also left rates unchanged at 4.25% yesterday. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the ECB, said the bank had kept rates on hold because \"annual inflation rates are likely to remain above levels consistent with price stability over a protracted period of time and risks to price stability in the medium term remain on the upside\".</p>",
  "<p>The US government today declined one state's request to halve the steep national ethanol target, signalling that America remains hungry for biofuels despite evidence of their role in the global food crisis.</p> <p>Although the decision by the US environmental protection agency (EPA) was not surprising, it deals a blow to the push for reining in ethanol's dramatic growth amid ballooning American grocery bills.</p> <p>EPA administrator Stephen Johnson said his agency found that the current 9bn-gallon target for blending ethanol into fuel \"is not causing severe economic harm\", which was the legal criteria necessary to waive the requirement. </p> <p>\"Rather, the [ethanol target] is strengthening the nation's energy security and America's farming communities,\" Johnson added.</p> <p>The state of Texas had asked for a onetime 50% cut in the target earlier this year as corn prices reached record highs, citing economic harm to the livestock industry. The request ignited a political firestorm over US ethanol, even as the UK and other nations began reassessing the consequences of a biofuel bonanza.</p> <p>But the biofuels industry fought back, pointing to a $100,000 contribution that a major US poultry company gave to Texas governor Rick Perry soon after he challenged the ethanol target.</p> <p>Moreover, since record-high oil prices began deflating last month, the price of corn has dropped by 32%.</p> <p>Perry condemned the denial today, describing himself as \"greatly disappointed with the EPA's inability to look past the good intentions of this policy\". </p> <p>\"For the EPA to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense, but every American's grocery bill,\" the conservative Texan said in a statement.</p> <p>The EPA's refusal to cut the high ethanol target relied upon a \"narrow\" interpretation of its authority, according to the agency.</p> <p>\"EPA would have to determine that the implementation of the [target] itself would severely harm the economy; it is not enough to determine that implementation \u2026 would contribute to such harm,\" the agency wrote in a fact sheet on its decision. </p> <p>The agency used modelling scenarios to determine the effect that cutting the target would have on food and fuel prices. Even in models where the Texas proposal would lead to less corn production, the EPA concluded that corn prices would drop by $0.30 per bushel at most.</p> <p>In that case of a small drop in corn prices, the EPA also found that a lower ethanol target would cause a $0.01 increase in fuel prices -- a finding that contradicts arguments made by the biofuels industry, which claims corn prices have fluctuated in line with fuel prices. </p> <p>The Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), the US group that represents ethanol producers, praised the EPA for taking note of recent studies \"which clearly state that skyrocketing oil prices are the main driver behind higher corn prices\". </p> <p>\"Most economists now recognise the real severe economic harm is being done by the skyrocketing price of oil and not by ethanol production,\" RFA president Bob Dineen said in a statement. \"In fact, without ethanol production the damage from high oil prices would be even worse.\"</p> <p>A Perry spokeswoman told the Guardian that the governor was examining his legal options to respond to the EPA and did not rule out a formal court challenge.</p> <p>Meanwhile, corn-producing states hailed the EPA's denial as an affirmation that biofuels are critical to the US economy.</p> <p>\"Our farmers are producing enough corn for our food, feed and fuel needs, and the growing ethanol industry is reducing our dependence on foreign oil,\" Nebraska Democratic senator Ben Nelson said in a statement. </p> <p>\"It is helping to hold down our high gas prices and it is providing home-grown economic growth in many states, including Nebraska.\"</p>",
  "<p>The latest Batman film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/\">The Dark Knight</a>, continues to break records, taking just 18 days to make <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7544574.stm\">more than $400 million</a>. Its popularity is part of the reinvention of the modern \"realistic\" superhero \u2013 a combination of celebrity twinned with powerful abilities and ultimately a flawed humanity. Yet the ability of celebrity to elevate a person's profile combined with an almost religious devotion to hero worship is a dangerous combination when it comes to choosing the next president of the United States.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/democracy-participation-to-passivity---can-things-change\">panel discussion</a> about political participation at the RSA recently, commentator <a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/events/speakers-archive/richard-reeves\">Richard Reeves</a> spoke about how everyone overestimates the power of individual action and underestimates the power of collective action. </p> <p>Nowhere is the idea of individual action more pronounced than in a superhero saving the world, especially a world more interconnected by issues than ever before. Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/24/obama-in-berlin-video-of_n_114771.html\">outlined these ideas</a> in Berlin saying that \"now is the time to join together, through constant cooperation, strong institutions, shared sacrifice, and a global commitment to progress, to meet the challenges of the 21st century\".</p> <p>Indeed, Obama is emerging as a 21st century political hero, if not quite yet across America certainly across the world. Rolling Stone magazine described him as \"the new hope\", and his profile is such that the McCain team decided to attack it as shallow celebrity over <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo0ItAXn-Ew&amp;feature=related\">genuine leadership credentials</a>. Attacks on him will mean that Obama, like Batman, will always have to wear a mask to separate the junior senator from Illinois from the ideals he represents which are far greater. It also means that if he is a true political hero he will have to sacrifice himself to the responsibilities of leadership. While Spiderman's uncle warned him that \"with great power comes great responsibility\", the current Bush administration is characterised by an avoidance of responsibility in a never-ending battle to manipulate the reality of its failure in Iraq. </p> <p>But for those suffering from Obama-mania there is a clear danger of disappointment. Beneath the slogan of \"change you can believe in\" is just a political appointment, albeit the most powerful one in the world, but still one surrounded by the checks and balances of America's constitutional democracy. Can Obama <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/issues/\">turn around</a> the American economy, bring health care to all and help 37 million Americans out of poverty just as Superman can stop an asteroid or Batman a psychopathic villain? </p> <p>What about beyond America's borders, where the checks and balances are equally restrictive? Obama, like Gordon Brown before him, is focusing a foreign policy agenda on Afghanistan simply because it is seen as a \"good war\" in contrast to the \"bad war\" in Iraq, ignoring the historical legacy of any major power trying to impose its will on the country. Obama has also placed emphasis on securing the Pakistan\u2013Afghanistan border as a means to strangle the supply lines and strategic depth of the Taliban. Yet as sound as such geopolitical rhetoric appears, the continued inability of the US to secure its own border with Mexico despite massive investment in manpower and surveillance technologies means that securing one of the world's most porous borders will be beyond him. </p> <p>The Bush years were a testimony to overestimating the limits of US power. Democracy and freedom are not reigning in the Middle East. The mighty Nato couldn't find Karadzic for years because he'd grown a beard. The mightier Americans have failed to locate Bin Laden and Mullah Omar, perhaps because they both had beards before the search began. The bottom line is that the superpower does not possess super powers.</p> <p>So what of Batman's voting choice? Reginald Hunter recently <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFFDdgRj3nE\">described</a> the caped crusader as a \"conservatives' wet dream\" \u2013 and certainly the scene where he uses extraordinary rendition in Hong Kong would identify him with the present Republican administration. In reality, however, Batman would be torn between the conventional war hero in McCain, and what Caroline Presno <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/caroline-presno/could-obama-be-the-next-p_b_101572.html\">described</a> as a postmodern hero in Obama. Most likely he will reserve judgment of either man until one or other is in power. As Batman once said: \"It is not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.\"</p>",
  "<p>Toyota's powerful surge to the top of the global automotive industry rankings has come to a halt with an announcement today that net income in the three months to the end of June had tumbled 28%. </p> <p>The Japanese carmaker, which has been running neck-and-neck all year with General Motors in the battle to become the industry's world leader, blamed a strengthening yen, rising raw material costs and sluggish markets in the US and western Europe.</p> <p>\"The financial results for this quarter were severe, due to our rapidly changing business environment. \" said Mitsuo Kinoshita, Toyota Motor Corporation's executive vice president. </p> <p>Toyota reported a 24,000 increase in the number of vehicles sold, to 2.19m. Net income fell to \u00a5353.5bn (\u00a31.7bn) from a record \u00a5491.5bn in the same period last year.</p> <p>In North America, Toyota said sales in the quarter had fallen by 33,000 to 729,000. Toyota said it lifted its market share to 17.4%, but admitted it had been hurt by the market slowdown, a shift from higher value trucks to lower margin compact cars, higher bad debts and an increase in sales incentives.</p> <p>Toyota said it would \"take swift action in accordance with market changes by increasing the supply of models in high demand and launching new models\".</p> <p>It reported higher sales in Japan, Australia and the Middle East as well as Russia and Eastern Europe, but was affected by the slowdown in western Europe.</p> <p>The company said it expected sales for its fiscal year, which runs to the end of March 2009, would be 8.7m units. </p> <p>In a further sign of the pressure facing motor manufacturers, General Motors has asked its advertising agencies to share in its pain by cutting their fees for campaigns to lure car buyers into showrooms.</p> <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that GM demanded price cuts of a fifth which would yield savings of more than $20m (\u00a310.2m) but could mean job losses at agencies such as McCann Erickson and Campbell-Ewald.</p> <p>A GM spokeswoman said: \"We have asked our advertising partners to work with us to eliminate low value work and to find creative solutions to go to market more efficiently.\"</p> <p>GM promotes brands such as Cadillac, Chevrolet and Hummer intensively through advertising campaigns, but the Detroit-based carmaker lost $15.5bn in the second quarter and its shares are trading at rock-bottom prices last seen in the 1950s. </p> <p>On Tuesday, the carmaker's board felt obliged to issue a statement affirming its ongoing confidence in GM's chief executive, Rick Wagoner.</p> <p>On a brighter note, Munich-based BMW posted a 2.2% rise in group sales last month helped by strong demand for the 1-Series coupe and cabrio as well as the full-size X5 and X6 offroaders. </p> <p>BMW's British-made Mini saw sales rise 2.1% in July and they are more than 15% up on the year to date. Rolls-Royce also reported strong growth, with more than 102 of its Phantom model being delivered in July, up by a fifth on the same month in 2007.</p> <p>In the first seven months of the year, overall deliveries of BMW marques rose by 4.4% to 890,699 vehicles. </p> <p>\"We intend to maintain our growth plan albeit we will continue to react to the world market situation on a month by month basis,\" said the sales director, Ian Robertson.</p>",
  "<p>It has been called An Inconvenient Truth for the economy. For some, Dark Night might be more appropriate.</p> <p>But instead of a caped crusader riding to the rescue of a citizenry at risk or a former vice-president delivering a cinematic Power Point presentation on the perils of climate change, a documentary set for release at the end of this month aims to warn Americans of a different global horror: debt.</p> <p>I.O.U.S.A. charts the role of debt in pushing the US economy towards the sort of cliffhanger ending beloved of movie-makers. Like Al Gore's Oscar-winning documentary, it features an array of talking heads, whiz-bang graphics, pie charts and timelines. </p> <p>And like Gore's movie it has been met with early acclaim, receiving a standing ovation at this year's Sundance film festival.</p> <p>\"It is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in America don't understand what the problems are,\" director Patrick Creadon told Reuters. \"We think our country is in a lot of trouble.\"</p> <p>Creadon previously made Wordplay, an acclaimed documentary about crosswords.</p> <p>Instead of Gore, the film features a former head of the US Government Accountability Office, David Walker, as well as a supporting cast including figures ranging from financial guru Warren Buffet to comedian Steve Martin. </p> <p>While many are used to living with a national deficit of $9.6tn, the documentary points out that once social security, healthcare and other obligations are factored in, the debt is closer to $53tn. One estimate has it that the national debt rises by $1m for each minute spent watching the film.</p> <p>Yet while the film and its makers counsel against debt \u2013 the core message is do not spend more than you have \u2013 I.O.U.S.A. itself is the product of debt financing.</p> <p>Made in 2006, its dire warnings of a mortgage crisis and impending recession became true before the documentary was released. </p> <p>As it became necessary to embark on a costly re-editing of the film, it exceeded its $500,000 budget, lost its main financial backer and ended up being financed by a production company set up by a Baltimore financial newsletter.</p> <p>But the financing saga of the film about financial crisis had a happy ending. The film will open in 10 cities across the country on August 21. </p> <p>Whether moviegoers seeking escapism will flock to a film advertising itself with a poster bearing the image of a shuttered White House and the slogan, \"For Sale. Foreclosure. Inquire within\" remains to be seen.</p>",
  "<p>Research over the past 50 years shows that children recognise differences, including skin-colour differences, by the age of three, long before they go to school. They are clearly learning to recognise the colours of the objects around them. So why do so many people still think that children do not notice differences in skin colour, too?</p> <p>The evidence also shows that, unless specific action is taken with them, many are likely to adopt racially prejudiced attitudes and behaviour towards those who are different. Children are not born with such attitudes. They are reflecting the attitudes and values derived from the embedded racism in society. This is particularly true of white children, although some black children may be learning this too. Black children may also be carrying the burden of learning that they are the objects of racism. Racism is damaging for all children \u2013 it limits their experience, curiosity and the chance to have a real stake in a compassionate and global society. </p> <p>If children are to grow up to be caring and responsible adults, we have to provide them with opportunities in their early years to understand prejudice, hatred and hurt. The <a href=\"http://www.ncb.org.uk/Page.asp?originx_6073ic_23555200356948j64k_2008772856u\">book</a>, Young Children and Racial Justice: taking action for racial equality in the early years, just published by the National Children's Bureau, aims to do just this.</p> <p>The book, which we have both been involved in writing, is designed for people who work with and care for young children, and approaches all issues about racial equality sensitively and within a framework that doesn't seek to blame. It describes how young children learn their attitudes to differences and how they need to be helped to unlearn any racially prejudiced attitudes that they may have already learnt. Because racism is so deeply embedded in our society the book unpacks the way it may influence the way adults and children learn and develop their attitudes to one another.</p> <p>True to form, two national newspapers published <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1032650/Children-young-reported-racism-Government-funded-group-claims.html\">articles</a> about the book, and took sideswipes at the National Children's Bureau and the government for apparently funding it. There was no such funding. Costs are to be covered by sales. Both articles took sections out of context and distorted others. For example, in the book there is a discussion about a child saying \"yuk\" to unfamiliar food, and the need to be alert to whether this is due to initial strangeness or a reaction to food associated with people from a particular ethnic or cultural community.</p> <p>One broadsheet <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/education/2261307/Toddlers-who-dislike-spicy-food-racist%2C-say-report.html\">headline</a> was \"Toddlers who dislike spicy food 'racist'\" \u2013 terminology clearly aimed at provoking dismissive ridicule. The general tone of the resultant comments, emails and blogs ranged from the derisory to the most appallingly crude. </p> <p>Our concerns about this reaction are, firstly, that commentators, bloggers and emailers may be parents and grandparents too. Their children may be attending early-years schemes. The fact that some have almost gleefully expressed such ignorance and hatred, and are apparently influenced by what they have read, reinforces the need for all early-years workers to enable children to learn to equally value and respect differences between people. Secondly, the fact that this web of hatred exists does not bode well for our society being at ease with itself. </p> <p>In the current climate, many racist attitudes are hardening. The media is a powerful force in shaping people's attitudes. With such hatred coming to the fore, much help is needed to counter its impact on children's lives before their attitudes become entrenched.</p>",
  "<p>Hang on there. Did I misjudge Paris Hilton? John McCain has been using Hilton and Britney Spears in an attack ad designed to suggest that Barack Obama is also, like, a global celebrity airhead, someone who attracts a crowd of 200,000 foreigners in Germany \u2013 twice what's he's managed at home \u2013 and has become both arrogant and presumptuous as a result of his premature fame.</p> <p>So far, so predictable. I ignore all controversy involving Hilton, so I ignored this one too. I did last night in a bar where it was showing on TV with the sound turned down - always instructive. But no. Hilton's counterattack is in the papers and on high IQ radio. I've just checked it out on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSJCnBz7cTg\">YouTube</a> and it's both smart and funny. It mocks McCain, who had it coming to him, but it also laughs at Paris Hilton. On her lounger in a leopard print swimsuit she shows self-awareness of the kind which has always eluded bluestockings like Germaine Greer and Richard Dawkins.</p> <p>\"Hey America, I'm Paris Hilton and I'm a celebrity too. Only I'm not from the olden days and I'm not promising change like that other guy. I'm just hot!\" she says in a script written for her by Chris Henchy, Brooke Shields' husband. </p> <p>But were Henchy (44) and Hilton (27) right to mock McCain (almost 72) for being a \"wrinkly white-haired dude\", so old he can remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in buckets? My instinct is yes, partly because the McCain camp started it and partly \u2013 see above \u2013 because Paris is also funny about herself. Before explaining her energy policy, she dips into Conde Nast Traveler looking for the best place to get a tan.</p> <p>The energy policy isn't daft at all: take McCain's commitment to drill for oil off the US coastal shelf (under strict environmental controls) and Obama's demand for alternative energy sources, and do a bit of both. Give Detroit tax incentives to make better hybrid and electric cars, she says. \"Energy crisis solved, I'll see you at the debates, bitches!\"</p> <p>The crucial point is that viewers will probably join in the joke. That's important: jokes work. Tony Blair defused Cherie's waspish aside about Gordon Brown by telling Labour conference: \"At least I know she won't run off with the bloke next door.\" Much more relevant here is Ronald Reagan's <a href=\"http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/debates/history/1984/\">ambush</a> of Walter Mondale in the second of the 1984 presidential debates. Mondale had knocked Reagan about a bit in the first, making him look tired and out of touch. In round two the wily president was waiting for his moment. When it came, Reagan said \"I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" Not a great gag, but everyone laughed. I was there and felt Reagan won re-election in that moment.</p> <p>A friend I chatted with at a wedding in Washington, who is desperate for the Democrat to win, almost whispered \"Does Obama have a sense of humour?\" It's a good question, and others share that fear. A sense of humour matters. McCain is not only old and notoriously bad-tempered, he's also said by people who know to be mean-spirited and capable of abandoning his more attractive and independent positions ( even on torture!) to ingratiate himself with the suspicious Republican mainstream. But he can be funny. When a reporter suggested that \"voters may reject you because they feel you're too old to be president\", McCain didn't move for a second or two. He was pretending to be asleep.</p> <p>You can imagine Vince Cable doing that, but not Ming Campbell, who is only a touch older but thinks older. Blair might pull it off, probably not Gordon Brown. David Cameron has a sense of humour. It's no guarantee \u2013 Mrs Thatcher was never accused of having one \u2013 but it helps.</p> <p>The McCain attack ads, and those freelance ones not authorised by him, are nastier than European voters probably realise, insulated as they are from paid political adverts (a great European achievement, incidentally). In 1988, Bush senior used racist crime ads to diminish that turkey of a Democrat, Mike Dukakis.</p> <p>But there's often a germ of truth in such viciousness. McCain's attack dogs want to paint Obama as an exotic: almost-foreign, liberal and elitist. That <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/covers/slideshow_blittcovers\">New Yorker cover</a>, intended to caricature that view of the Democratic candidate and his wife, helped McCain, I feel sure. </p> <p>Trouble is there's something there, a kind of distance from the electorate in the highly-efficient Obama campaign which American friends - mostly Democrats - confirm. I don't think he's got the election in the bag, as much liberal commentary around the world assumes. Middle America is a very cautious and conservative place. Even in states like Massachusetts, white working class Americans are not sure what to do. It isn't just the race thing, either. With 97 days to go, you can take comfort if you seek it from <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/05/obama-calls-mccain-out-af_n_117142.html\">Obama's response</a> to McCain's jibe that the Democrat's answer to the fuel crisis is that American drivers should keep their tyre pressure up and save gas. It's good advice, of course, but McCain mocked it. \"It's like these guys are proud of being ignorant,\" Obama told his own crowds. </p> <p>But George Bush is said to have quoted Abraham Lincoln's maxim about being able \"to fool some of the people all of the time\" - adding \"they're they ones we have to concentrate on.\" A good joke - though scary. Don't push your luck and post another ad, Paris, there's too much riding on this election. You may not get it right next time.</p>",
  "<p>Shoppers in Clapham high street in south London are feeling the pinch from the credit crunch. </p> <p>\"I try to prepare food and freeze it,\" said Jenny O'Mahony, an events organiser. \"I am trying to cut down on buying luxuries.\" </p> <p>She would like to see stamp duty suspended, even if only temporarily, to unblock the housing market. \"Gordon Brown is doing what he can,\" she said. It's a global issue.\"</p> <p>Vanessa Potter, a TV producer, said: \"I'm changing my ways, sadly. I'm trying to buy cheaper food.\" </p> <p>On interest rates, she said: \"I think it's good they stayed where they are. They shouldn't go up\".</p> <p>She was keen to see the government make some move on stamp duty: \"It's an absolute con. It creates even more of a debt. Either remove it completely or keep it \u2014 just don't keep it on hold.\" </p> <p>Peter Saxon, a train driver, is considering getting rid of his car because of fuel prices and insurance costs. \"Petrol should drop considerably,\" he said. </p> <p>He is also concerned about the housing market. \"The threshold of stamp duty should be increased substantially,\" he said. </p> <p>Scott White, who works in marketing, said the Bank of England had made the right decision on interest rates \"because short-term problems are far better than the long-term effects of inflation\". </p> <p>He said the government was handling the economic downturn badly. \"They can't just solve it, all they can do is damage limitations,\" he said. \"They have made serious errors and have shown they are not a cohesive unit\".</p> <p>Pauline Croft, a surveyor, was not keen to see stamp duty suspended. \"Anything that encourages the housing bubble to inflate is a bad idea.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Edinburgh Fringe prides itself on being the largest arts festival on the planet. A more brutal way of putting it would to be to describe it as the world's biggest artistic meat market. Mother Courage herself would be proud of the way that an event which began with hangers-on pitching tent around the international festival has evolved into three weeks of horse-trading. </p> <p>Edinburgh can still be the most thrilling place on earth, a mad melee where reputations are forged and careers ignited, but with the costs of both living and performing spaces rocketing, thousands of artists troop north each year and come away with nothing but a huge hole in their pocket. As a result, many who might like to dip a toe in the Edinburgh pond are scared off, and theatremakers who aren't natural risk takers opt for something a little safer for the month of August. A nice revival of Bouncers, perhaps, or three weeks on a Greek island.</p> <p>At the launch of this year's Fringe back in June, director Jon Morgan announced that because the festival is not curated or programmed and is open to all, it is truly democratic. Lots of people don't agree, and theatremaker Andy Field is one of them. \"It may seem democratic,\" says Field, \"but it's a democracy that comes with a \u00a310,000 price tag. It is only open to those who have got money, three weeks to spare and who make work that fits neatly into a 50-minute time slot. It's a marketplace that excludes a great many artists.\"</p> <p>He has a point: to suit the venues, many Edinburgh shows have been shoehorned into under an hour's running time: overrun your 75-minute time slot and you become subject to a fine that rises alarmingly by the minute. It's an environment that encourages plenty of dusty one-man shows featuring just a table and a chair. And it's not just artists but audiences who are the losers, particularly with many tickets now costing over \u00a310.</p> <p>But what if there was another way? Along with playwright Deborah Pearson, Field, an ex-Edinburgh student who spent two years working at the brilliant international venue Aurora Nova (sadly not running this year), decided that there was. The result is Forest Fringe, a free venue situated in an old church hall in Bristo Place with a not-for-profit organic cafe attached. Last year it operated in a low-key fashion. But on the couple of occasions I went, the place was buzzing. Word of mouth proved sufficient to attract promoters, some of whom offered international dates to shows including Field's own Exposures and David Overend's Demises.</p> <p>This August Forest Fringe returns, bigger and much more visible, and operating entirely outside the main Fringe programme (so don't look for it there). Its intriguing 15 days of events could kickstart a revolution in the way theatre is made and shown on the Fringe. Those presenting work include Lucy Ellinson (who has worked with Unlimited and Third Angel), Nic Green (Cloud Piece), Rabbit (responsible for the treasure hunt embedded in Punchdrunk's Masque of the Red Death), Abigail Conway (Home Sweet Home), Derevo proteges Rain People, French company Comme un Gant, Action Hero, and the Battersea Arts Centre, who will be hosting scratch performances and offering workshops. </p> <p>It's a programme that defies categorisation, with intimate one-to-one experiences, social gaming (organised by Hide and Seek's Alex Fleetwood), puppetry, devised work and plays \u2013 some written by writers attached to Soho theatre \u2013 all rubbing shoulders. Tim Etchells of Forced Entertainment and the Shunt crowd have been among those who have recommended artists to Pearson and Field. And, astonishingly, artists showing their work won't have to pay a penny to rent their slot, and audiences will pay only what they can, with the pot split 50/50 between the venue and the artists. </p> <p>How can it possibly work? \"If you can find a space and find the artists who are willing to support it, it's amazing how much you can do on no money,\" says Pearson, who successfully ran the venue on her own last year. Although artists won't be paying for the privilege of showing work, all will be giving something back. Some established artists such as Jon Spooner and Chris Thorpe of Unlimited will be mentoring younger artists; some will be providing technical help; and others will be doing the washing up, manning the box office and cleaning the lavatories. Short runs mean that people don't have to commit themselves to Edinburgh for all of August, and won't mind bedding down on a floor for a couple of nights.</p> <p>Field admits that because it has none of the resources of established venues, and will be operating on a shoe string, Forest Fringe will have a \"lo-fi aesthetic\", but argues that the offer of a beautiful old room in an unconverted building will be enough for many artists and audiences. Many people, he suggests, are weary of an Edinburgh Fringe that feels as if it is being run by savvy businesspeople who have a template for financial success.</p> <p>\"Artists have to fit in with guidelines that are dictated by marketing, business and promotion,\" he says.</p> <p>Field says that he's always found it rather odd that so many theatremakers spend three weeks gated together in Edinburgh during August, and yet actually make very little work. By contrast, Forest Fringe will offer the chance to collaborate and try things out in front of audiences ready to take a risk.</p> <p>And while this might sound hippyish and charmingly naive, both Pearson and Field are exceptionally level-headed. They have budgeted to ensure they can both run Forest Fringe during Edinburgh, and also provide support for the work developed there beyond the festival season. In this they are part of an enterprising new generation of theatremakers and producers who are resilient, self-reliant and adaptive, are not wedded to dusty old models, and have a genuine faith that if you don't milk them like cash cows then audiences are up for anything.</p> <p>\"These are hard times,\" says Pearson, \"and to survive you have to be imaginative.</p> <p>\"We'll count what we've done a success when people see what we've done and say: 'If they can do it, then we can do it too.'\"</p> <p>- Forest Fringe runs August 5-19 at 3, Bristo Place, Edinburgh.

  "<p>Ryanair fired the first salvo in a price war today as it halved its cheapest fares. </p> <p>Europe's largest low-budget carrier is offering one million seats at \u00a35 next month including charges and taxes. It will lose at least \u00a35 on each UK sale, because the fare does not cover the \u00a310 air passenger duty charge.</p> <p>Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said the move represented a halving of its so-called T fares, the cheapest on Ryanair flights, which represent about half of the seats sold per flight. </p> <p>He said: \"If passengers are booking ahead of the 80% seat target, we will close off the cheap seats. If we are booking behind it, we will open up more cheap fares.\" </p> <p>O'Leary said the primary motive for the sale was to stimulate faltering demand rather than drive rivals out of business. He said high oil prices would have a far greater impact on financially weak airlines than another cut-price seat offer. </p> <p>\"Ultimately it is oil and the operating losses that will force some of these guys to the wall,\" said O'Leary. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ryanair\">Ryanair</a> flights break even when the planes are 80% full and O'Leary admitted the airline was having to \"dump\" fares in order to fill its planes, amid weakening demand for seats. </p> <p>\"We will dump the price to wherever it needs to be in order to get to 80%,\" O'Leary vowed. </p> <p>Ryanair is heading for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/29/theairlineindustry.travelleisure\">its first loss in 20 years</a> due to high fuel costs, driven by the global oil spike, and weakening passenger demand. </p> <p>The Dublin-based carrier said it would plunge from a profit last year of \u20ac439m (\u00a3347m) to a loss of up to \u20ac60m if the cost of keeping planes in the air stayed at record levels. </p> <p>The profit warning was compounded by an admission that the sales outlook was weaker than expected and a planned 5% fares increase would have to be reversed - underlined by today's sale. </p> <p>The carrier is grounding 20 planes this winter in order to conserve costs, a move that is being replicated across the industry with a 7% capacity cut among all airlines - equivalent to nearly 60m fewer seats - taking place in the final quarter of 2008. </p> <p>Some experts have warned fares will rise as a result, but low-budget carriers such as Ryanair, whose business model is predicated on the pile-high sell-cheap principle, are under pressure to slash ticket prices due to the wider economic downturn. </p> <p>O'Leary said he wanted a recent fall in the oil price from $147 per barrel to around $120 per barrel to be reversed, in order to ensure Europe's most cash-strapped airlines were not bailed out by banks willing to take a risk on an industry revival. </p> <p>\"If airlines get a break in the oil price, some of them will get financing from some idiot. The more expensive oil is, the faster we roll up the loss-making companies that are not going to survive anyway.\" </p> <p>O'Leary confirmed plans to launch hand luggage-only flights in the autumn. The experimental ban on checked-in bags will take place on four routes: Dublin to Cork, London to Glasgow, Rome to Milan Bergamo and Frankfurt Hahn to Berlin. </p> <p>About four out of 10 Ryanair passengers travel without bags since the airline introduced bag check-in fees.

  "<p>Less than one fifth of the biofuel used on UK roads meets government environmental standards intended to safeguard human rights and guarantee carbon savings, figures released today show. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/rfa/\">Renewable Fuels Agency</a> says just 19% of the biofuel supplied under the government's new initiative to use fuel from plants to help tackle global warming met its green standard. For the remaining 81% of the biofuel, suppliers could not say where it came from, or could not prove that it had been produced in a sustainable way. </p> <p>The suppliers began mixing the biofuel into all petrol and diesel supplies in April, under the <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/environment/rtfo/\">Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation</a> (RTFO). The figures show that biofuel accounted for 2.1% of UK road fuel for the first month of the scheme, against a target for the year of 2.5%. Most (86%) was biodiesel, with just 14% bioethanol. </p> <p>Scientists and campaigners have warned that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/biofuels\">biofuels</a> could cause more problems than they solve, with concerns over the destruction of tropical forests and impact on global food supplies. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Agency, which plans to issue monthly updates on the figures, said the environmental standard was intended to address those concerns. It is based on several existing standards, and covers issues from child labour to water and soil conservation. It does not include carbon emissions from indirect effects such as changes in land use caused by biofuel planting, which experts have warned could cancel out their environmental benefits. </p> <p>Over the year, suppliers are supposed to ensure that 30% of the biofuel meets the standard, but the target is not mandatory. The spokesman said: \"This is a new process and we hope to see performance improving. We still think 30% is achievable over the year.\"</p> <p>The figures show most biofuels were imported, with the largest proportion of identified supplies coming from the US. More than 6m litres of biodiesel came from oil palm, crops that have been linked to severe deforestation and the deaths of orang-utans in south-east Asia. The true figure could be higher because half the biodiesel used could not be traced to its country of origin.</p> <p>Asad Rehman, biofuels campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said: \"The shocking admission that we are unable to identify the origin of nearly half the biofuels used in the UK means that the government cannot assure the British people that the biofuels in their petrol tanks have not destroyed rainforests.</p> <p>\"That less than a fifth of the biofuels used fail to meet even minimal environmental standards adds further weight to Friends of the Earth's view that they are a phoney solution to climate change. The government must put the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation on hold and vote against EU biofuels targets.\"</p> <p>Dr Sue Armstrong Brown, the RSPB's head of countryside and species conservation, said: \"This report is even worse than we feared and shows what a shambles the UK's biofuels' policies have become. </p> <p>\"Here is yet more proof, direct from a UK government body, that voluntary environmental and social standards just aren't working. These standards must be strengthened and made compulsory before targets are raised any further. </p> <p>\"The industry has been allowed to answer 'I don't know' to many sustainability questions. That isn't good enough and could mean habitat destruction, and the massive release of greenhouse gases, is going on unreported and undetected. It should mean all plans for raising biofuels targets should be dropped.\"</p> <p>The Renewables Fuel Agency published the Gallagher review into biofuels earlier this year, which recommended that the government slowed the introduction of biofuels until more was known about the possible negative impacts. </p> <p>Ministers responded by reducing the rate at which the RTFO's biofuel targets will increase, so that the total biofuel content in petrol and diesel will reach 5% in 2013-14. A separate EU plan aims to include 10% biofuel in transport fuel by 2020.</p>",
  "<p>Rejecting the call for a windfall tax on our energy companies, blogger <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/business/trading-floor/880041/judging-an-idea-from-whence-it-came.thtml\">Tim Worstall</a> said, \"if an idea is being proposed by those you normally regard as being in error, the idea will probably fail your own tests of its reasonableness.\" Quite right and, the opposite must also be true, which is why I was more than happy to join the likes of Roy Hattersley, Ruth Lister and Helena Kennedy \u2013 all of whom I agree with on most things \u2013 as a signatory to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/06/oilandgascompanies.taxandspending\">letter</a> yesterday calling for such a measure.</p> <p>Too often, politicians fail to relate what they advocate to the kind of society they want to build, or they dress up policy in rhetoric which belies their actual intention. Meanwhile Joe Public is left wondering what on earth this bunch are all about and how their vision of a good society differs from that of the other lot. Well, here is the perfect opportunity to provide some much needed definition.</p> <p>Since 2000, people have faced gas price rises of 100% and electricity rises of 61%, with British Gas <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7533389.stm\">raising its prices</a> by a staggering 35% in recent weeks. These form part of a global trend, the causes of which are so complex and varied that most economists don't agree on them, and the energy companies are certainly enjoying the resulting bounty. Shell, BP and Centrica (which owns British Gas) reportedly made <a href=\"http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-1040328/British-Gas-splashes-25-000-junket-Jimmy-Carr-35-price-hikes-Government-hints-energy-firms-windfall-tax.html\">\u00a31,000 every second</a> of the day for the first six months of this year. To put this in context, what BP presently makes in profit every month is roughly equivalent to what my local council, Lambeth, spends on running local services every year.</p> <p>People living in communities like mine in Streatham, containing some of the most deprived wards in the country, are struggling to cope in the face of these price hikes \u2013 they are being clobbered. Every 10% increase in energy prices leads to an extra 400,000 people joining the 2.5 million already living in fuel poverty in Britain today. Yet, the energy companies, flush with these huge unearned profits, spend just \u00a350m a year combating fuel poverty and have only agreed to raise this to \u00a3150m a year by 2010 (less than BP is currently making in profit every week).</p> <p>The signatories to the letter are in the business of politics because they want to build a fairer, more equal, democratic and sustainable world. This necessitates, amongst other things, government intervention where appropriate to ensure that markets serve more of the people, more of the time, in a sustainable way. Simply equipping individuals to swim alone, only stepping forward when they look like they're drowning, is not acceptable \u2013 action must be taken. </p> <p>Worstall, the <a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/\">Adam Smith</a> brigade and others think differently \u2013 they think the state must leave people alone to get on with life; as the <a href=\"http://tpa.typepad.com/bettergovernment/2008/08/the-case-agains.html\">TaxPayer's Alliance</a> puts it, \"if government really wants to help it should reduce the burden of regulations and taxes\". The price hikes are not the fault of the energy companies, let the market do its work and keep out of it.</p> <p>However, the point is not that the energy companies \u2013 the winners in this climate \u2013 require punishment for their unearned fruits (though their spending on tackling fuel poverty is frankly a disgrace), or even that the increase in global fuel prices is their fault; it is that those fruits should be spread more widely to relieve the burden on the losers in this situation. A windfall tax is not going to sort the global structural issues contributing to these problems, but in the short term, whilst world leaders work out what is to be done, the proceeds from such a tax could be pledged to help those in, and at risk of falling into, fuel poverty. In the long term, they can be put towards renewable energy production.</p> <p>The principle objections to a windfall tax appear to be that it would discourage future investment, the energy companies would simply raise their prices or, at the more extreme end, the said companies would change their domicile to another country for tax purposes. But where is the evidence for this? So many of those who claim investment would drain away represent these large conglomerates \u2013 when have turkeys ever voted for Christmas? One loses count of the number of times big business has wrongly forecast the worst just when government has indicated it will intervene to put right the more obscene aspects of the system in which we live.</p> <p>Provided the windfall tax is set at a reasonable level, there is no reason why these companies should have to resort to such drastic actions. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies concluded in its <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/fs/articles/fslucy.pdf \">evaluation (pdf)</a> of the 1997 windfall tax on the utility sector, the tax is unlikely to have a serious effect on the economic behaviour of the companies concerned if one ensures the measure is seen as a one-off. No one is proposing that it should be anything but \u2013 it would, after all, be only the second time in the last decade such a tax was levied \u2013 so let's get on with it.</p>",
  "<p>Not since London at the height of Britpop has a city exerted such a pull on global hipsters as Berlin does right now. In terms of electronic music, this is not just the German capital, but the world capital: a white-hot crucible of creativity and 24/7 clubbing, which, thanks to its good transport and communication links, and the cheap standard of living, is attracting a significant influx of international DJs, musicians and producers.</p> <p>The likes of techno legend Richie Hawtin and Peaches led the way in the early noughties. By 2006, the census reported that over 13,000 Americans were living in Berlin. Go drinking or record shopping in Kreuzberg, and it won't be long before you hear British voices. Already, some warn of \"overkill\".<br>But what is life really like for those who move to Berlin? Is it all lost weekends in clubs (\"Where they go another night, alright!\" as LCD Soundsystem's North American Scum had it), or dreary afternoons spent indoors learning German? Is it the bohemian city of legend, or does Berlin tie residents up in Teutonic red tape?</p> <p>Certainly, property is cheap. Buyers can find one-bedroom flats in Friedrichshain from \u00a350,000. Rents are similarly competitive. In Kreuzberg, a large two-bedroom flat will cost you around \u00a3250/ \u00a3300-a-month. The creative's essentials - food, cigarettes, beer, rehearsal/studio space - are two-thirds cheaper than in London. As the city's openly gay mayor, Klaus Wowereit, likes to put it, Berlin is, \"poor, but sexy\".</p> <p>Settling in, however, can take time. Mundane details like registering with the local authorities or getting your broadband connected can be a hassle. DJ/ producer Matt Styles, who has lived in Mitte for a year, says a patient, German-speaking friend is very useful: \"And for my utilities and insurance I use a German company set up for ex-pats.\" </p> <p>English is widely spoken in Berlin, but both Styles and Sue Denim, of electro-poppers Robots in Disguise (who has lived in Berlin \"on and off\" for three years), are learning German. \"It's difficult, though,\" says Denim. \"I probably sound really thick. My favourite mistake was asking a waitress if she had a small face - the word for dish is similar.\"</p> <p>In terms of nightlife, Berlin offers huge variety. Denim is currently \"semi-straight edge\" (\"I was partying too much in London and wasting too much time in recovery.\") but still regularly finds herself up all night, particularly when she's DJing. \"Everything works to a different time scale here,\" she says of clubs that don't get going until 3am. \"I like that.\"</p> <p>That peculiar moderation, managing to mix sleepless nights with productive days, is very Berlin. It is a city where Sunday afternoon at Panorama Bar can easily turn into Monday morning at Bar 25, but (tourists aside) you will see few \"casualties\" on the dancefloor. If clubbing in Berlin is chaos, it's a controlled chaos - exhilarating fun, rather than reckless debauchery. </p> <p>It's an older scene - \"In Berlin, 40 is the new 30,\" announced bilingual magazine Bang Bang Berlin when it launched last year - and consequently more sensible. Outside of their blow-outs, many Berliners live wholesome, healthy lives. \"I used to lose myself in amazing parties a lot when visiting, but not so much now I live here,\" says 30-year-old Styles. \"I've a lot to get done.\"</p> <p>For most ex-pats, this includes enjoying what is, certainly in the eastern districts, a remarkably relaxed capital city. In summer, Berlin is a city of bikes, cafes, parks, temporary beaches and, recommends Denim, swimming \"in the amazing Badeschiff swimming pool in the Spree.\" You can eat surprisingly well and cheaply here, and there is culture and history galore, should you want it. </p> <p>Berlin is also famously liberal. \"You can walk down the street dressed as a leopard or mermaid and not get stared at - I've done both,\" say Denim. \"In terms of gender and sexuality anything goes.\" Although, she doesn't over romanticise Berlin: \"In other ways, it's not as cosmopolitan as London. Other than the Turkish community, it's a very white city.\"</p> <p>The generally easy-going lifestyle, rather than any magical musical atmosphere in the city, is, it seems, what attracts people. \"It's great making music here, but I'm not convinced it's better or worse than many other cities,\" says Denim. \"It's just a lot cheaper and more relaxed.\"</p> <p>Although, as Berlin's legend grows, the city that has already given the world electroclash and minimal techno is fast becoming its own self-fulfilling prophecy. From producers like Ricardo Villalobos and Booka Shade to labels like Perlon and Mobilee, this is where electronic music's biggest players are now based. This is the city in which to approach labels, forge musical alliances, DJ and get noticed. </p> <p>Every scene has its cliques and closely guarded secret parties, but, broadly, Berlin's electronic underground is open, unpretentious and resolutely anti-corporate. Industry figures are approachable. Berlin's big-name DJs still play small local events. VIP rooms are notably absent. \"Berliners don't like social hierarchy,\" says Styles. The city, he says, is rife with \"creative opportunities\". </p> <p>Opportunities that increasing numbers of women are exploiting, too. \"Women think, 'I can do something here,'\" says Liz McGrath, editor of Bang Bang Berlin. \"They dare to take chances. It's so cheap to live here you don't need to be in a relationship or be married. You can do things on your own.\" Although, as Sue Denim warns: \"Don't live on your own to start with, unless you're looking for a particular type of isolation. And move here in spring, because winter is a killer. It can be so cold you can't breathe outside.\" Styles agrees about the sub-zero temperatures in February, but thinks the future is otherwise bright for Berlin: \"It's the right place at the right time, and I'm not sure I can see another European city coming along to challenge it.\"</p>",
  "<p>When I read the initial media reports of Jacqueline Scott's report into attitudes around women and the workplace, my heart sank. \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1042004/Superwoman-myth-say-modern-women-family-life-suffers-working-mums.html\">Superwoman is a myth</a>\" read one gleefully. The Guardian's opening <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/06/equality.gender\">salvo</a> was pretty depressing as well: \"Support for gender equality appears to be declining\". But on closer reading, I realised that Scott was not telling all women to stay at home and bake, nor was she pouring scorn on those that did. Rather she was highlighting the dilemma that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/07/women.workandcareers\">many women face</a> today. Which path to go down? What will be the effect on my family and my ability to fulfil either role effectively? And underlying this dilemma is the fact that the workplace is still not a women-friendly environment, particularly for mothers.</p> <p>I firmly believe that we need to look more carefully at why more women are worried about the potentially negative effects that going out to work might have on their family. If there was more access to high quality, affordable and flexible childcare I expect many women would feel more comfortable about working. If the workplace was more amenable to the flexibility that parenthood demands then the incentives would be higher. It is still the case that in the majority of households, whether both parents work or not, the woman carries most of the burden of housework and childcare. So perhaps if modern working life gave men more flexibility, recognising that they have a key role to play in their child's upbringing, then women might find it easier to juggle the role of carer and earner. In fact a 2005 <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/Documents/EOC/PDF/Research/dads_and_their_babies_executive_summary_wales_eng.pdf\">survey (pdf)</a> by the Equal Opportunities Commission found that 70% of fathers would like to be more involved in childcare than they currently were.</p> <p>\"Women\" in this country are not one body but 30 million individuals who each have the right to live their life in the way that suits them best. Perhaps some want to stay at home. Others want to work full time and get to the top of their chosen professions. Others want something in the middle. I feel passionately that the role of government is not to dictate but to give every woman a genuine choice about how to manage her life. For years, women's role was decided by men. Now that has changed, and women can choose their own direction. And the very fact that women are choosing different things should be celebrated. </p> <p>I am proud that the Conservatives have committed to policies which will go some way to giving women that choice. We've announced proposals to extend the right to request <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&amp;obj_id=137126\">flexible working</a> to all those with children under the age of 18. We've committed to a flexible parental leave policy which allows maternity leave to be split between both parents. Giving fathers the option to be more involved will give mothers more freedom to go back to work should they wish to. I hope these measures will lead us towards a society in which both parents can choose to fulfil their roles in exactly the way that suits and strengthens their family.</p>",
  "<h2>THE QUESTION</h2> <p><strong>How can we celebrate the start of the Olympics?</strong></p> <p>Why, by paying a visit to your local Chinese restaurant, of course. It is 100 years to the month that the first Chinese restaurant opened in Britain. We took a look through the foodie archives to chart the rise and rise of Chinese cuisine:</p> <p><strong>1908: </strong> Chung Koon opens Maxim's in London's Soho, quickly followed by the Cathay in Piccadilly</p> <p><strong>1957: </strong>Chung Koon's son opens up-market Lotus House. It's a roaring success, allowing him to open Britain's first Chinese takeaway, in Queensway</p> <p><strong>1968: </strong>Michael Chow opens Mr Chow, making London the first home of the global chain</p> <p><strong>1970s: </strong>The residents of Birmingham and Edinburgh finally get to sample Chinese food, at The New Happy Gathering and Ping On. The Rendezvous chain introduces Londoners to more slightly more authentic dishes</p> <p><strong>1974: </strong>London's Lee Ho Fook becomes the first Chinese restaurant in Britain to be awarded a Michelin star</p> <p><strong>1980: </strong>Kenneth Lo opens the influential Memories of China. The Zen chain is also a major player during this decade.</p> <p><strong>2001: </strong>Alan Yau opens Hakkasan, the most glamorous Chinese eatery to date, which is frequently ranked as one of the best 50 restaurants in the world</p> <p><strong>c2003: </strong>Regional Chinese food gains grounds, thanks to new restaurants such as London's Yming and Hunan</p> <p><strong>2004: </strong>Dumplings are all the rage after Alan Yau opens his London dim sum restaurant, Yauatcha</p> <p><strong>c2006: </strong>Szechuan restaurants spring up, including Red Chilli in Manchester and Bar Shu in London </p> <h2>IN SEASON</h2> <p><strong>Rabbit</strong></p> <p>For some reason, 'ickle fluffy bunnikens are not a particularly popular foodstuff in Britain. There are three possible reasons for this: their Peter Rabbit connotations; their association with second world war food shortages; and the perception that rabbit meat is a bit dry and/or meagre. To all three problems we say: don't be ridiculous. Morally, eating wild rabbit is no different to eating a chicken or a cow. Historical associations change - look at oysters, traditionally a food for the poor. And cooked properly, rabbit is delicious - buy two if you've got a hearty appetite.</p> <p>Wild rabbit (don't buy farmed) is low in fat and high in protein. At this time of year, you can throw them on the barbecue, anointed with olive oil and herbs. Later in the year, the rabbits will be older and the meat tougher, so slow cooking is a better option.

  "<p>Climate change activists today blockaded a biofuel depot as part of a week-long protest camp based at Kingsnorth power station in Kent. </p> <p>The protesters said they were stopping fuel lorries from leaving or entering the Vopak depot in Thurrock, Essex, to show their anger at the environmental destruction caused by biofuels. </p> <p>Eight people who lay in the road with their arms in \"lock-on tubes\" to stop police removing them were arrested. Others unveiled a 12-metre banner from the top of one of the site's containers proclaiming a day of action against biofuels. Four people chained themselves to a fuel storage tank. </p> <p>The campaigners said they stopped the lorries entering the site, but police said the blockade had been broken up.</p> <p>Vopak said its main concerns were the safe removal of the protesters and the safety and security of its terminal. Its UK operations manager, Craig Garbutt, declined to comment on the protest itself </p> <p>The blockade is part of the week-long climate camp outside Kingsnorth. The estimated 1,000 campaigners at the site near Hoo are opposed to proposals by its owner, E.On, to build a new on-site coal-fired facility. It would be the first such plant built in Britain for more than 30 years.</p> <p>The climate activists at Vopak were targeting biofuels - petrol or diesel made from plant materials. Biofuels were originally seen as a greener alternative to fossil fuels, but have been shown to cause deforestation and contribute to food price rises as land use is switched to growing fuel crops such as palm oil and maize. </p> <p>The protesters said companies such as Greenergy and Tesco, which use the depot for biofuel supplies, were causing food price rises, world hunger, ecosystem destruction and accelerated climate change. </p> <p>Julia Brownlow, one of the protesters, said: \"Agrofuels are destroying the very ecosystems which can stabilise the climate - with the collapse of the Amazon possibly just a few years away I am left with no choice but to take action.\"</p> <p>The camp for climate action, which began with a march from Rochester on Sunday, has been marred by clashes between police and campaigners. </p> <p>Officers confiscated weapons and other items after carrying out a search of trees and undergrowth surrounding the camp site on Monday evening.</p>",
  "<p>Do Chinese leaders ever wish they had never agreed to stage the Olympics? Probably not, but they may well have mixed feelings. On the plus side, China has built some <a href=\"http://video.aol.com/video-detail/inside-birds-nest-stadium/1534604647\">nifty-looking stadiums</a>, there has been an outpouring of national pride - especially among the young - and it sets the seal on China's ambition to be a global mover and shaker.</p> <p>Yet, the games have been a right pain too for the Chinese leadership. The event has turned into an irresistible magnet for human rights activists to protest many issues from Tibet to Darfur. Today, Christian activists were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/aug/07/christian.protest.china\">arrested</a> at Tiananmen Square, where hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators were killed in 1989. </p> <p>Yesterday, four pro-Tibet demonstrators were deported after unfurling Free Tibet banners on a lamp post. For groups such as <a href=\"http://www.thechinadebate.org/en/\">Amnesty International</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/05/china19547.htm\">Human Rights Watch</a> and celebrity campaigners such as Mia Farrow, the Olympics has been an unparalleled opportunity to get their message across about human rights abuses in China and unsavoury regimes that Beijing supports.</p> <p>China has had to endure criticism not just from activists but from those higher up the food chain. George Bush today had some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2008/aug/07/george.bush.china.olympics\">blunt words</a> for China saying the US firmly opposes the detention of political dissidents, human rights advocates and religious activists. It could have been worse. Bush chose to speak in Bangkok rather than waiting to arrive on Chinese soil to sound off, so as not to rub Chinese faces in the dirt.</p> <p>But the Chinese are notoriously thin-skinned to criticism and will not appreciate Bush's words no matter where they were said. In Chinese eyes, what countries do at home is their own business; Chinese leaders don't pass judgment on others' domestic policies and they don't expect other governments to comment on China's internal affairs. This is the doctrine of state sovereignty at its most rigid. </p> <p>China's sensitivity to foreign criticism can also be attributed to past humiliation at the hands of outsiders. As <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21715\">Orville Schell reminds us this week in the New York Review of Books: </a></p> <blockquote> <p>\"A particularly important element in the formation of China's modern identity has been the legacy of the country's \"humiliation\" at the hands of foreigners, beginning with China's defeat in the opium wars in the mid 19th century and the shameful treatment of Chinese in America.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Little wonder then that China puts so much importance in not losing face. China of course can hit back at the likes of the US for double standards. As Bush was calling on China to allow more freedoms to its own people, Osama bin Laden's driver was convicted of supporting terrorism - although he was cleared of more serious conspiracy charges - by a much-criticised military commission at Guantanamo Bay. The Chinese may also want to remind Bush once he arrives in Beijing - gently or not so gently - that he was the one that invaded Iraq in a war that Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, called illegal.</p> <p>Some commentators believe that the Olympics has actually prodded China to become a better international citizen. <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/04/opinion/edcha.php\">Victor Cha this week wrote in the International Herald Tribune</a> that China has taken away incentives for Chinese companies doing business in Sudan and cut arms sales to Burma after its crackdown last year against demonstrators, including monks. Others are downright dubious about holding the Olympics in China.</p> <p>In a piece for the Los Angeles Times, Heather Havrilevsky, wonders <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-havrilevsky7-2008aug07,0,7413817.story\">what on earth possessed Olympic organisers to award China the games.</a></p> <p>\"That good old Olympic spirit, set against the backdrop of the deeply depressing realities of life in China, makes this summer's festivities feel about as uplifting and cheerful as an accidental shooting at a wedding reception,\" she writes.</p> <p>The piece would have been more effective if she had not gone into overkill by talking about the \"systematic oppression of 1.3 billion people\". That is patent nonsense. This is a country that has <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/08/04/do0404.xml\">lifted 250 million people out of poverty</a> in the last 30 years, which is an incredible achievement. Most of Africa would not be in such a mess if African governments had shown the same zeal in fighting poverty. As a Somali told me recently: \"The difference between China and Africa is that when Chinese leaders see the economic pie in front of them they want a small slice, but African leaders want the whole pie for themselves.\" But that is another debate.</p> <p>For the time being, the Olympics should be seen as a foretaste of what China can expect if it wants to assume a leadership role on the world stage. For China to expect that its domestic policies should not be criticised is totally unrealistic. Those who harbour pretensions to leadership are subject to scrutiny whether they like it or not. Notwithstanding all its past history of humiliation, China will have to acquire the political maturity to withstand criticism - fair or unfair - that comes with growing international power and prestige. Or as Truman said: \"If you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen.\" The Olympics will be a good training ground for China to endure the barbs that will come its way in the years to come.</p>",
  "<p>Few economists were surprised by the Bank of England's decision to leave interest rates unchanged today, and some believe the next move is more likely to be a cut than a rise.</p> <p><strong>Lee Hopley</strong>, head of economic policy at <strong>EEF</strong>, said the monetary policy committee is being pulled in opposite directions by rising inflation and slowing growth.</p> <p>\"However, the balance of risk appears to be shifting more rapidly. A cut in interest rates may be needed sooner rather than later to prevent the economy from drifting towards recession.\"</p> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong> of consultants <strong>Global Insight</strong> believes the Bank of England really had little option than to keep interest rates at 5%. </p> <p>\"The ever growing likelihood of recession calls for lower interest rates, yet this is precluded by elevated inflation levels and risks. Elevated inflation levels and risks call for higher interest rates, yet this would increase the danger of a deeper, extended recession. Best therefore to sit tight for the time being. Nevertheless, there could well have been a three-way split in the vote again,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>David Kern</strong>, economic adviser to the <strong>British Chambers of Commerce</strong>, said the MPC was keen to maintain credibility in the face of an expected upturn in inflation, but warned that it cannot ignore the growing danger of recession.</p> <p>\"While the near-term rise in inflation is unavoidable, it is also temporary as weaker growth would clearly push down inflation sharply next year. Limiting the threat of a major recession must be the priority. As soon as inflation peaks later in the year, the MPC should start cutting interest rates without delay.\"</p> <p><strong>Stephen Robertson</strong>, head of the <strong>British Retail Consortium</strong>, said: \"With a difficult balancing act to achieve between keeping the inflationary threat at bay while also stimulating the economy in the midst of the current slowdown, this is the right decision for now.</p> <p>\"At our quarterly meetings with the Bank of England, the BRC and major retailers are saying weakening sales and record low consumer confidence show the downturn is deepening. To avoid turning the slowdown into a slump, as soon as conditions allow, the Bank's next rate move should be down.\"</p> <p><strong>Richard Lambert</strong>, head of the <strong>Confederation of British Industry</strong>, said: \"The latest data show the slowdown in UK economic activity gathering pace, and business and consumer confidence falling further. However, with inflation heading higher in the next couple of months, the Bank is right to leave rates on hold for the time being.\"</p> <p><strong>Adam Lent,</strong> head of economics and social affairs at the <strong>TUC</strong>, said: \"While the government talks of the need for an economic recovery plan to restart growth in the UK, the Bank is doing all it can to hold down consumer confidence and business investment.</p> <p>\"This is not the time to be holding rates when the prospects for the economy in 2009 look increasingly weak. The Bank should cut and cut fast.\"</p> <p><strong>Michael Coogan</strong> at the <strong>Council of Mortgage Lenders</strong>, said: \"The MPC faced a difficult decision today in the face of rising inflationary pressures and a slowing economic outlook. </p> <p>\"Holding the Bank rate is better than raising rates, as one MPC member suggested last month, but a reduction would have been a welcome recognition of the current financial strains on households already struggling with hikes in other living costs.\"</p> <p>\"As a result of recent Bank rate reductions, mortgage rates are below their peak at the end of 2007 but many consumers will be looking to the MPC to respond soon to the slowing economy and reducing inflationary pressures.\" </p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">House prices</a> fell by almost 11% in the 12 months to July, Halifax said today - thought to be the first double-digit drop since the lender began publishing a monthly survey in the mid-1980s.</p> <p>The UK's largest mortgage lender said the average price of a home in the UK had fallen by almost \u00a322,000 over the year, from \u00a3199,084 in July 2007 to \u00a3177,351 last month.</p> <p>Prices have been falling since last August, when Halifax's house price index reached a peak of \u00a3199,600. </p> <p>The past three months have all seen falls in excess of 1.5%, with July's 1.7% drop following a fall of 2.5% in May and 1.9% in June.</p> <p>The 10.9% drop revealed by comparing the seasonally adjusted average price in July 2007 with that in the same month this year is bigger than the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/07/house.prices.property\">8.8% year-on-year fall</a> quoted by the lender.</p> <p>Commentators at Capital Economics said it was the first time annual house price falls on the index had entered double digits since it was launched in 1984, and that the figures for the past three months showed prices had fallen at a rate of 20% a year. </p> <p>They described Halifax's figures as \"dire\", adding: \"With the housing market still plagued by tight lending criteria, falling buyer confidence and now a rapidly weakening economy, the end for this housing market correction remains a long way off.\"</p> <p>Halifax refused to confirm that annual price falls had reached record levels, stating that its method of calculating annual changes showed a clearer picture of what is happening in the market.</p> <p>Since December 2002, instead of comparing months directly Halifax has taken an average over three months and compared it with the same period of the previous year. As a result, it is quoting an 8.8% fall in prices year on year.</p> <p>A spokesman said this method \"captured the underlying trend of house price movements\". He added that any fall over the past year needed to be viewed in the context of several years of rising prices.</p> <p>\"July's figures are compared with a period when house prices were rising quite steeply. Our index peaked in August so you are comparing two periods either side of that,\" he said. </p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said the drop was sharper than any seen during the early-1990's housing downturn and it was \"odds-on\" that the market would continue to fall.</p>",
  "<p>Barclays today apologised for its share price performance as it posted a sharp drop in profits and wrote off another billion pounds as the credit crunch continued to pummel Britain's banks. </p> <p>Britain's third largest bank made pre-tax profits of \u00a32.75bn in the first half of the year - slightly more than analysts had predicted but 33% lower than a year ago when it made \u00a34.1bn. </p> <p>The fall in profits, which chief executive John Varley admitted was \"acutely disappointing\", was largely caused by the ongoing credit crunch, which sent profits at its Barclays Capital division tumbling by more than two thirds to \u00a3524m. </p> <p>The bank said Barclays Capital had suffered losses of almost \u00a32bn through its exposure to the credit market, including securities backed by US sub-prime mortgages. </p> <p>Varley said conditions in the banking sector over the past year had been \"as difficult as we have experienced in many years\". </p> <p>\"Although I take some comfort from our relative performance in managing our risks and in generating income, a decline in profit of 33% is acutely disappointing. And I add to that my disappointment at the decline in our share price. Our shareholders have had to endure a lot,\" he said, adding the bank was trying to work hard to improve conditions to bolster the share price. </p> <p>Bob Diamond, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/barclaysbusiness\">Barclays</a> president and head of the investment banking arm which has caused fresh \u00a31bn of credit crunch writedowns, said the bank's management were \"up for the challenge\" of boosting its performance. </p> <p>Barclays' shares have fallen by 45% this year, but after dropping in early trading today they were up more than 4% at 11am at 385.25p, a gain of 16p. </p> <p>The bank is concerned about the economies of the UK, Spain and South Africa and Varley predicted little improvement in general trading conditions for the \"foreseeable future\". </p> <p>The fresh \u00a31bn of credit crunch writedowns comes on top of \u00a31bn written off in the first quarter. However, if \u00a3850m of gains on the value of its own debt which the bank has offset against these losses are factored in, the writedown reaches \u00a32.8bn for the first half. </p> <p>Its total impairment charges came to \u00a32.45bn, up from \u00a3959m. As well as Barclays Capital's charges, this included a rise in bad debts from business customers and in the UK mortgage market. </p> <p>The bank had been criticised for not marking down its assets as much as rivals but Barclays insists its assets are of higher quality. </p> <p>In a conference call today, Varley said there had been \"a great deal of disclosure\" in today's results statement and he was \"completely confident about the rigorous approach\" of markdowns. </p> <p>These latest writedowns come less than a month after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/19/barclaysbusiness.banking\">Barclays' \u00a34.5bn fundraising drive</a> from investors such as the Qatar Investment Authority. </p> <p>That \u00a34.5bn of fresh capital helped improve its crucial tier one core ratio - used to measure capital strength - which rose to 6.3%. The bank's target is for a 5.25% \u2013 it stood at 5% at the end of June before the funds arrived. </p> <p>Looking forward, Diamond said there would more \"challenging environments\" for the balance of 2008 and 2009. </p> <p>However, he said the issue of liquidity was no longer a problem following co-ordinated action by central banks to inject money into the markets. \"That has been by and large resolved,\" he said, adding that the concerns now were oil prices and how much the global economy would weaken as markets waited for an end to the freefall in the US housing sector. </p> <p>Varley said the difficult trading conditions also created new opportunities for Barclays to expand its market share and diversify its business which would help the bank weather the downturn.</p>",
  "<p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertwatson\">Professor Bob Watson</a> is not <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/audio/2008/aug/07/james.randerson.climate.change.bob.watson\">speaking</a> out of turn in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/06/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange\">telling the world</a> to prepare for four degrees of global warming. \"Mitigate for two degrees; adapt for four\" has long been the catchphrase among climate negotiators and campaigners. Translated, that means: try to reduce emissions to stay below two degrees of warming, but also prepare for the worst. </p> <p>And Bob Watson should know \u2013 he is the former chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (<a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\">IPCC</a>), but <a href=\"http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/climate-change/mg17423392.400\">was kicked out at the behest</a> of the Bush administration for being too vocal about the threat presented by global warming. (Any sceptic reading who thinks that the IPCC is a conspiracy of environmentalists take note: it is a creature of government as well as of science.) He has long made clear his own personal passion and commitment to tackling the issue \u2013 often without mincing his words. He is also someone with a very wide-ranging perspective: after leaving the IPCC, Watson chaired the <a href=\"http://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.aspx\">Millennium Ecosystem Assessment</a>, a landmark UN study published in 2005 looking at the totality of human impact on the planet's natural systems. (The news wasn't good.)</p> <p>The problem with the \"mitigate for two degrees; adapt for four\" strategy is that it is doomed to fail. Yes, we should certainly prepare for the worst as far as possible \u2013 with flood defences, drought-resistant crops and strategies to ameliorate the loss of wildlife, at the very least \u2013 but a look at the likely impact of a four-degrees temperature rise suggests that such a dramatic change would probably stretch society's capacity for adaptation to the limit, not to mention having a disastrous effect on the natural ecosystems that support humanity as a whole. </p> <p>By the time global temperatures reach four degrees, much of humanity will be short of water for drinking and irrigation: glaciers in the Andes and Himalayas, which feed river systems on which tens of millions depend, will have melted, and their rivers will be seasonally running dry. Whole weather systems like the Asian monsoon (which supports 2 billion people) may alter irrevocably. Deserts will have spread into Mediterranean Europe, across most of southern Africa and the western half of the United States. Higher northern latitudes will be plagued with regular flooding. Heatwaves of unimaginable ferocity will sear continental landscapes: the UK would face the kind of summer temperatures found in northern Morocco today. The planet would be in the throes of a mass extinction of natural life approaching in magnitude that at the end of the Cretaceous period, 65m years ago, when more than half of global biodiversity was wiped out. </p> <p>Four degrees of warming would also cross many of the \"tipping points\" which so concern climate scientists: the Amazon rainforest would likely collapse and burn, as part of a massive further release of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems \u2013 the reverse of the current situation, where trees and soils absorb and store a good portion of our annual emissions. Most of the Arctic permafrost will lie in the melt zone, and will be steadily releasing methane, accelerating warming still further. The northern polar ice cap will be a distant memory, and Greenland will be melting so rapidly that sea level rise by the end of the century will be measured in metres rather than centimetres. <br> Hence the current effort \u2013 led by scientists, in the main \u2013 to drop the two degrees target and talk instead about getting carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere back down to less dangerous levels. This year's CO2 concentration is 385 parts per million (ppm) \u2013 now <a href=\"350.org\">a campaign is forming</a> to get them back down to 350ppm, about the level they were at in the mid 1980s. This isn't just about reducing emissions, it is about getting emissions quickly down to zero (by 2050 or earlier), and then removing some of the excess carbon that humanity has already dumped into the atmosphere. The planet will still get warmer, but on nothing like the scale currently predicted. </p> <p>The harsh truth is that the latest science shows that even two degrees is not good enough, never mind four. And since four degrees would be a catastrophe that many of us, or our children, would not survive, it is surely our absolute duty to do everything in our power to avoid it.</p>",
  "<p>When the opening ceremony of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympicgames2008\">Beijing Olympics</a> begins, viewers will be presented with a minutely choreographed spectacle swathed in nationalist kitsch. Of course, images that recall Hitler's goosestepping storm troopers are the last thing that China's leaders have in mind for their Olympics; after all, official Chinese nationalism proclaims the country's \"peaceful rise\" within an idyll of \"harmonious development\". But, both aesthetically and politically, the parallel is hardly far-fetched. </p> <p>Indeed, by choosing <a href=\"http://www.albert-speer.de/AP_Schluesselprojekte.php#\">Albert Speer Jr</a>, the son of Hitler's favourite architect and the designer of the <a href=\"http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1936\">1936 Berlin Olympics</a>, to design the master plan for the Beijing games, China's government has itself alluded to the radical politicisation of aesthetics that was a hallmark of 20th century totalitarianism. Like those regimes, whether fascist or communist, China's leaders have sought to transform public space and sporting events into visible proof of their fitness and mandate to rule. </p> <p>Speer Jr's commission was to lay out a master plan for the access to the Olympic complex in Beijing. His design centered on the construction of an imposing avenue to connect the Forbidden City and the National Stadium in which the opening ceremony will take place. His father's plan for \"<a href=\"http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1594327,00.html\">Germania</a>\", the name Hitler selected for the Berlin that he planned to construct after the second world war, also relied on such a mighty central axis. <br>China's rulers see the Olympics as a stage for demonstrating to the world the exceptional vitality of the country they have built over the past three decades. And that demonstration serves an even more important domestic political objective: further legitimising the regime's continuing rule in the eyes of ordinary Chinese. Given this imperative, an architectural language of bombast and gigantism was almost inevitable. </p> <p>So it is no surprise that the Beijing games may resemble the hubristic games that beguiled Hitler and enthralled the German masses in 1936. Like the Beijing games, the Berlin Olympics were conceived as a coming-out party. Josef Goebbels' Nazi propaganda machine was fully deployed. Athletic imagery \u2013 used to brilliant effect in Leni Riefenstahl's acclaimed documentary \u2013 appeared to create a link between the Nazis and the ancient Greeks, and to confirm the Nazi myth that Germans and German civilization were the true heirs to the \"Aryan\" culture of classical antiquity. </p> <p>Like his father, Speer Jr \u2013 an acclaimed architect and town planner \u2013 sought to create a futuristic global metropolis. Of course, the language that he used to sell his scheme to the Chinese was very different from the words his father used to present his plans to Hitler. Instead of emphasising his design's pomposity, the younger Speer insisted on its environmental friendliness. The 2000-year-old city of Beijing should be transported into hyper-modernity, whereas his father's 1936 Berlin design was, in his words, \"simply megalomania\". </p> <p>Of course, the sins of the father should never be visited on the son. But, in this case, when the son borrows essential elements of his father's architectural principles and serves a regime that seeks to use the games for some of the same reasons that animated Hitler, is he not willingly reflecting those sins? </p> <p>Totalitarian regimes \u2013 the Nazis, the Soviets in 1980, and now the Chinese \u2013 desire to host the Olympics as a way to signal to the world their superiority. China believes that it has found its own model to develop and modernise, and its rulers regard the games in the same way as the Nazis and Leonid Brezhnev did, as a means of \"selling\" their model to a global audience. </p> <p>Obviously, the Chinese were naive to choose an architect whose name carried such dark historical connotations. The name of Speer itself probably did not matter to the officials who chose him. They sought to stage an Olympics that made manifest their image of themselves, and Speer Jr, looking back to his father's mastery of the architecture of power, delivered the goods. </p> <p>The realisation of Speer Jr's Olympic vision, and that of his patrons, marks the end of a welcome interlude. For years following the end of the cold war, politics had been removed from the games. A gold medal signified the sporting abilities and dedication of individual athletes, not the supposed merits of the political system that produced them. </p> <p>But now we have returned to an aesthetic of political mesmerisation, reflected in the host government's declared aim that China should win more gold medals than any country before it. As the Olympic torch relay \u2013 itself a creation of the Nazis, first employed in the Berlin games - makes its way down Speer Jr's avenue of power, the world will once again be made to witness a triumph of the totalitarian will. </p> <p><em>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008. </em></p>",
  "<p>Former Argentina manager Marcelo Bielsa had had more than enough of his job long before he left it, but he didn't want to leave it \"without winning something\". So he led the country's football squad to Olympic gold in Athens in 2004 and promptly quit saying \"I have what I came for\".</p> <p>Many felt his performance at the 2002 World Cup - when Argentina didn't even make it past the first round - was the main legacy of his tenure, but others took the victory at the Olympics as a return to the comfort zone of 'best in the world' category Argentinians so relish.</p> <p>Olympic football has always been a bit of an oddity. Even this year the number of competing countries (16) dictates that the men's group stages kick off today - a whole day before the inaugural ceremony of the actual Olympics, thereby giving the football bit a kind of 'fringe' flavour.</p> <p>But in fact Olympic football, on the handful of occasions in which it has been on the nation's radar, has been revered by Argentina as part and parcel of all things football; the country's favourite game. Daniel Passarella's side won silver in Atlanta 1996 - again a super antidote to 1994's excruciating World Cup failings. And for all that the tick would have us believe there's no such thing as winning silver ('just losing gold'), the trophy cabinets of the Argentinian Football Association are lined with the silver medals of the 1928 squad, when Domingo Tarrasconi became the top scorer of the event with nine goals. On the other two occasions in which medals were collected for the national coffers, players of the ilk of Hernan Crespo (1996) and Carlos Tevez (2004) also topped the goal scoring charts. With only five participations in the Olympics to date, that record is brilliant.</p> <p>So when current national manager Coco Basile turned down the Olympic campaign preferring to concentrate on the World Cup qualifiers instead, youth manager Sergio 'Checho' Batista was more than ready for the challenge. A World Cup-winning player in 1986, Batista was appointed to take charge of youth football at the end of last year, and the Olympics - arguably the most important sporting event the world knows - will provide the ideal launch pad for him.</p> <p>The expectation of success is huge - and the squad he has assembled more than fit to deliver. He first gathered a working draft of what would become the Olympic squad at the end of May in Barcelona. Then, Sergio Ag\u00fcero, widely lauded as the next best player in the world, was joined by the likes of Fernando Gago, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, and none other than Lionel Messi. In a friendly against Catalunya, Messi played only 70 minutes by agreement with Basile, who wanted him fit and rested for an important fixture against Brazil a fortnight later. And when he came off, the only goal of the match came courtesy of Ezequiel Lavezzi, who is making an impact with Napoli.</p> <p>Perhaps that was the first taste Batista had of the nuances that come along with having Messi in a squad; up until now he has spent most of his press conferences fielding questions about the shared nature of his star player. This time, it is not the World Cup qualifiers and Basile who claim a slice of the young prodigy but rather Barcelona. Even back in May the Spanish giants were making no effort to hide their discontent at the idea of Messi missing out on pre-season training, and more crucially they want him available for the Champions League third qualifying round first-leg tie next week.</p> <p>At the time, Messi spoke candidly of his dream of participating in the Olympics; of how his team-mates who had done so - both at club level as was the case with Ronaldinho for example, and at national level - had spoken to him of the superbly unique nature of the experience, and of how for him the national strip was an honour not to be easily snubbed. \"As a manager I would love to count with him in the squad,\" Batista told me, also back then, adding that he was confident the issue would be resolved between the relevant authorities.</p> <p>And that is the saga that has unfolded since, drip by drip, with one relevant authority after another taking it in turns to pronounce, appeal, refute and over-rule each other. The AFA, Fifa and the IOC have now been joined by the CAS - the Court for the Arbitration of Sport, who have been holding the trump card: yesterday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/feedarticle/7706715\">they ruled that Messi should abide by his contract</a> and Barcelona can demand he returns to Spain.</p> <p>The argument in favour of Messi staying with the Olympic squad is based on the notion that an under-23 player should always be available for Olympic duty. Barcelona's argument is more reflective of the contractual nature of their relationship with Messi, looking to start the season as their most veteran and coveted professional. A new take on the old '<a href=\"http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=558406&amp;sec=global&amp;root=global&amp;cc=5739\">club versus country</a>' tug with the twist of 21st-century Olympic reality, which is that everyone is a pro and the purity of the sporting spirit is becoming elusive.</p> <p>Either way, the issue has rather stolen the limelight from the squad as a whole, and it's impossible not to feel that to some extent preparations for their first game against Ivory Coast today will have been marred by the will-he-won't-he be staying nature of Messi's participation. Currently it looks set to continue as Messi and Batista claim the player will stay in China despite the CAS ruling.</p> <p>It's a shame, I fear, because Argentina have enough talent and enough stories to keep the momentum going even without him.</p>",
  "<p><br>The consequences of a global temperature rise of 4C are catastrophic: from drought, to heatwaves, to crop failure and disease. Photograph: Reuters</p> <p>As environment web editor, I think a lot about the risk of doom-mongering we run when reporting gloomy environmental news. But risk is in fact what this is all about: how lucky do we feel in gambling with the planet's future?</p> <p>In our exclusive today, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Watson_(scientist)\">Bob Watson</a>, one of the world's most eminent climate scientists, says that while we should aim to limit the rise in global temperature to 2C, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/06/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange\">we must prepare for a rise of 4C</a>. That 4C is a global average, by the way, and higher latitudes will see higher rises. The reason we must hope for the best and prepare for the worst is that there is a chance that the worst will occur, and that chance is not insignificant.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_King_(scientist)\">Sir David King</a>, the UK government's former chief scientific adviser, who supported Watson's warning, notes that even with a comprehensive global deal to keep carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere at below 450 parts per million there is a 50% probability that temperatures would exceed 2C and a 20% probability they would exceed 3.5C.</p> <p>The list of consequences of such large rises in temperature over the next century are simply catastrophic, from drought, to heatwaves, to crop failure and disease. The journal Nature has published excellent summaries of the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0806/fig_tab/climate.2008.50_F1.html\">global impacts</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0806/fig_tab/climate.2008.50_F2.html\">regional impacts</a>.</p> <p>But as scary - and familiar - as such points are, a couple of other things stood out to me. First, Watson says: \"We don't know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2C target.\" Now this man battled the ozone hole, chaired the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\">IPCC</a>, advised the Clinton administration, was chief scientist at the World Bank and is now science adviser to the UK government's environment department. If he doesn't know, no one does.</p> <p>Perhaps even more terrifying is the reaction of Neil Adger, an expert on adaptation to climate change at the <a href=\"http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/\">Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research</a> in Norwich, UK: </p> <blockquote> Thinking through the implications of four degrees of warming shows that the impacts are so significant that the only real adaptation strategy is to avoid that at all cost because of the pain and suffering that is going to cost. There is no science on how we are going to adapt to 4C warming. </blockquote> <p>So the risks are both huge and real. The only thing that stops a full-blown panic is the timescale. These impacts will strike over decades, though they are being set in train now. The big question then is how can urgent action be stimulated in governments, business and individuals to tackle this clear and future danger? All ideas welcome.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">House prices</a> fell by 1.7% in July, as pressure from rising household costs and the continued squeeze on mortgage availability deterred potential homebuyers from entering the market, the UK's largest mortgage lender said today.</p> <p>Halifax said the average price of a home in the UK has fallen by 8.8% over the past year to \u00a3177,351, the level it was at in June 2006. </p> <p>This is the largest year-on-year fall in prices reported by Halifax since December 1992, and compares with a 6.1% drop in June. </p> <p>However, the market may be falling even faster than that. Halifax's quoted annual price is based on a comparison of quarterly figures, which it says provides a better picture of underlying trends than a straight monthly year-on-year comparison. </p> <p>When the average price for July 2008 is compared with the same month last year, prices are actually down by almost 11%, falling by nearly \u00a322,000 from \u00a3199,084. </p> <p>This is a sharper drop than any that was seen during the housing market downturn of the early 1990s.</p> <p>Halifax's headline figures are similar to those published last week by Nationwide building society which reported a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/01/houseprices.property\">1.7% fall in July and an annual drop of 8.1%</a>.</p> <p>Suren Thiru, an economist at Halifax, said the market was being driven down by a decline in mortgage availability, resulting from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a>, and a squeeze on household spending resulting from double-digit growth in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/energy\">energy bills</a> and food prices. </p> <p>Despite recent falls, house prices remain high in relation to earnings, making it difficult for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/firsttimebuyers\">first-time buyers</a> to enter the market.</p> <p>\"Pressure on householders' income, together with a very significant reduction in mortgage finance due to the global financial markets crisis, is constraining potential house buyers' ability to enter the market,\" Thiru said. </p> <p>\"This is resulting in both lower prices and activity levels.\"</p> <p>However, he added that continued high levels of employment - with a record 29.59 million people in work in May this year - would prop up the market over the coming months. </p> <p>\"A solid labour market, low interest rates and a shortage of new houses continue to support the market,\" he said.</p> <h2>Demand to stay low</h2> <p>Despite Thiru's optimism, recent figures on mortgage approvals suggest demand for houses is set to remain low over the coming months, which could drive prices down further.</p> <p>The Bank of England has reported approvals for purchases running at almost 70% below last year's level, with just <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/jul/29/mortgages.property\">36,000 new mortgages approved in June</a>. </p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, warned that the numbers could fall further following recent speculation about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/06/gordonbrown.economy\">changes to the stamp duty rules</a>. </p> <p>He said it was \"highly possible that housing market activity will be depressed in the very near term by the speculation that the government will shortly either defer or temporarily suspend the paying of stamp duty\". </p> <p>\"Given the heightened expectations over such a move, the longer the government waits before making its plans known - one way or the other - the more housing market activity could be hit as people wait to see what is happening,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Any further slowdown in already very weak housing market activity would be liable to push down prices.\" </p> <p>The Halifax figures come as the Bank of England's monetary policy committee considers its latest base rate decision, which will be announced at midday today.</p> <p>Most economists think the Bank will hold <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">interest rates</a> this month, and Halifax said it expected rates to remained unchanged at 5% for the rest of the year.</p> <p>Thiru said that despite mortgage rates going up for new borrowers in the wake of the credit crisis, the average mortgage rate paid on all outstanding loans had actually fallen over the first six months of the year.</p> <p>Borrowers are paying an average of 5.76% on their loans, compared with 5.97% at the end of last year.</p>",
  "<p>The new edition of Private Eye reports a sharp exchange last month between MPs and Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, which I hadn't read anywhere at the time. It concerns the leak which triggered the historic run on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/northernrock\">Northern Rock</a> bank by anxious depositors.</p> <p>We're approaching the first anniversary - August 9 - of the day the banking system started going belly up, the revelation by the major French bank BNP Paribas that some of its sub-prime related investments were in serious trouble. </p> <p>With hindsight it had started in Germany a week earlier, when three state (Land) banks had to be rescued by the government over similar exposure. It was something Berlin did, incidentally, without regard to the EU rules on subsidy that would later inhibit King's Rock options.</p> <p>Reading the anniversary articles and a lively new book by my old Guardian colleague, Alex Brummer (<a href=\"http://www.play.com/Books/Books/-/204/261/-/4997160/The-Crunch/Product.html?searchtype=genre\">The Crunch</a>, Random House Business Books, \u00a311.99) it's now much clearer that the major banks - retail and investment variety - behaved far more greedily and stupidly in repackaging and selling on dodgy debt than anyone had grasped at the time - including them. Remember the Wall Street titan who said he couldn't leave the dance while the music played on ...</p> <p>The more senior the banker the less he/she seems to have understood what the staff were doing to boost their grotesque profits. \"We'll never trade in things we don't understand again,\" they tell government officials now. Yeah, right. Don't believe a word of it. As soon as the current crisis bottoms out the wideboys will be devising new financial instruments by which they can make a parasitic living.</p> <p>There had been warnings around the global banking community, from the Bank of International Settlements and from Japanese bankers whose own system has only lately emerged from a decade of stagnation arising from their own housing bubble. </p> <p>Unfortunately the regulators - in Washington, at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, and in London - seem to have been looking the wrong way, too concerned with managing inflation and economic growth via interest rate policy to devote enough time to the fundamental stability of the structures holding it all up.</p> <p>Brummer's book confirms that when Northern Rock's troubles surfaced - the run started on Friday September 14 - the \"tripartite\" regulators at the Bank of England, the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority (FSA) were still trying to catch up with the facts on the ground. </p> <p>Its supervisory arm badly managed, the FSA had failed to give the Rock a yellow card for its \"Together\" 125% mortgage package - the ones that are now most prone to default - and the Rock's non-executive directors had failed to challenge chief executive Adam Applegarth - or Applecart as we call him here. The FSA was already warning about the falling quality of credit, yet it sanctioned a major dividend pay-out in June, sending precisely the wrong signal to the markets.</p> <p>Should King have pumped money into the banking system last August as the US Federal Reserve and - spectacularly - the ECB under Jean-Claude Trichet did, instead of sweating the banks under the doctrine of \"moral hazard\" (ie don't rescue the bastards from their own mistakes) which was much criticised by - of course - banks?</p> <p>Probably, though I am told Trichet may eventually find he has ended up holding a lot of worthless bankers' paper without the crisis continuing to unfold - as it is still doing. One of the recurring themes of the drama is the extent to which the overpaid bankers blame state bodies such as the Bank and FSA agencies for not stepping in earlier to stop them from misbehaving so badly. Petty criminals on council estates often come up with the same excuse.</p> <p>Should King and the Treasury have sanctioned the Lloyds TSB takeover of the Rock, as George Osborne and others always say? Possibly, but easier said than done. Lloyds wanted government-guaranteed loans of up to \u00a330bn - sums too large to have been pulled together in a secret deal, let alone in line with EU rules. </p> <p>The consortium of German banks acting quickly in August had needed a 10th of that sum - in what were still far better financial conditions at that stage. As we all now know, hesitant ministers tried to get a private buyer as an alternative to nationalisation and failed as the clouds gathered around global finance. As sole shareholder it has had to put up \u00a33bn to shore up the Rock for much the same reasons as other foolish banks have had to admit Asian sovereign funds into major shareholdings. Not since Pearl Harbour has the US suffered such a strategic blow.</p> <p>Now: back to that leak and Mervyn King's exchange with members of the Treasury select committee. According to the Eye's account, which I have confirmed with a Tory MP present (it's correct), King was asked why he hadn't staged a leak inquiry after the BBC's Robert Peston reported the eventual Rock rescue plan the night before it was to be announced - thus triggering the run on the bank.</p> <p>\"I don't think any leak inquiry has ever produced a very productive result. It is pretty clear where leaks tend to come from,\" he replied. MPs' ears pricked up, King realised he'd blundered and started to bluster. He had \"absolutely no idea where the leak came from\", he insisted, denying what he had previously said.</p> <p>The implication here is that Whitehall leaked to Peston - possibly the Treasury or, as Brummer reports in The Crunch, No 10 - to demonstrate it was on top of the crisis. Brummer has also written: \"The finger has been pointed in Whitehall at Finsbury, the Rock's PR advisers, who might have felt that releasing the information would bring an end to speculation and halt the calamitous fall in the bank's share price.\" King told MPs it couldn't be chaps at the Bank because so few knew the secret.</p> <p>Was someone merely careless? Or were they trying to manipulate events, thinking a leak would ease the impending shock? No one has ever resolved it. Peston duly broadcast his scoop on late-night TV and the BBC's website. The papers picked it up and depositors raced to their local branch to withdraw their savings. Would it all have happened if the rescue plan had been announced in an orderly way that Friday - as planned? It had been brought forward by 72 hours at Alistair Darling's insistence. He had feared a leak, Brummer writes.</p> <p>It's hard to say. Given the enormity of the consequences for the City's reputation - pictures of queues outside the Rock's branches flashed round the global village - I wondered whether it was a scoop worth sitting on in the public interest, as sometimes happens even in lawless Fleet Street. </p> <p>Chums I respect say no. \"You couldn't have predicted a run on the bank; you can't make such calculations,\" says one. I'm not convinced, especially now that I know how limited UK deposit guarantees - now changed - then were. Depositors clearly did know.</p> <p>But that leak? I have an interest in such stories because I spent time last year arguing that Downing Street under Tony Blair had no interest in leaking details of the \"loans for honours\" investigation - most of which probably came from the police who did have such an interest, ie to set the suspects against each other (pretty routine stuff).</p> <p>Some of today's newspapers report a similar mechanism at work. Yesterday's Telegraph led on a daft claim by an unknown Miliband supporter claiming that the foreign secretary had offered Alan Milburn the chancellorship in the event he became prime minister. I don't doubt that someone claimed that to be the case - though it's self-evidently daft. </p> <p>But it's never the media's fault, so today's explanation is that Brown aides in No 10 put out the story to damage Miliband by painting him as an \"uber-Blairite\", which is how they see Milburn. If you believe that you need a holiday.</p> <p>Yet Brummer's book contains one specific leak which may shed some light. As market conditions worsened last August the mighty Barclays Bank found itself short of cash and went to the Bank of England for a routine loan, twice, \u00a3300m the first time. Within hours the new leaked and Barclays got a kicking on the financial pages - thereby adding to the mounting sense of insecurity. So far as I can tell no one has yet blamed No 10 for that leak. So far.</p>",

  "<p>Graeme Smith has already caused the resignation of two England captains during his time in charge of South Africa and today he is certainly yearning to deflate Kevin Pietersen's reputation from the outset.</p> <p>Smith might not express it so forcibly these days, but he still has sympathy with those who observe Pietersen's South African roots, regard his England career as a convenience, and his captaincy of England as a sham. The man who South African players call The Ego has been elevated to Captain Ego and they do not like what they see. With the Test series already won, they are not short of a new incentive.</p> <p>\"Back in South Africa there will be people who respect his ability as a cricketer, but who are also emotional about him taking the job of England captain,\" Smith said yesterday. \"I'm sure there are people in England who feel the same way.\"</p> <p>The first England Test side under Pietersen's leadership brings a Test return for Steve Harmison \u2014 it has finally dawned upon England that Ryan Sidebottom is unfit \u2014 and a reshuffled batting order in the absence of Michael Vaughan.

In the short term, Pietersen may be very successful, but the balls-to-the-wall approach really isn't sustainable. He has been a single-minded player. It is not only about your own performance. That is going to be his biggest challenge. You bump your head a bit as a captain and it's how you face up to it that matters.\"</p> <p>If Smith had been given out lbw on the back foot to Monty Panesar then England would probably have won at Edgbaston, the series would have been 1\u20131, and Vaughan and Smith would today have been combatants in a mighty climax to the series.
