Photograph: Simon Wheeler</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the past 40 years or so, gardeners have gone from being prolific seed-savers to enthusiastic purchasers of commercial seeds. There is nothing wrong with buying seed - you have to start somewhere - but it is genuinely important to save your own, and not just because it will save you money. </p> <p>Most seeds on sale are hybrids, where every seed is the same, year after year. When you save seed from your own garden, however, you are maintaining slightly different strains of vegetables and flowers. These \"open-pollinated\" strains, created by insects, birds, the wind or other natural pollinators, represent a living gene bank that is adapted to local conditions. Why does this matter? Because we have unwittingly created a standardised growing system, which relies on standard conditions and fertilisers. Yet our climate has never been, and never will be, constant. We need a gene bank that will have enough variation to adapt to our future needs. Seed saving is fun, cheap and a powerful political gesture. </p> <p>It is also easy. You just need a little botany, some paper bags, a pencil and the willingness to give up part of your fridge to next year's bounty. Seed forms as a result of pollination and successful fertilisation of a flower. Once that happens, an embryo begins to form. This contains cells that will develop into the first root, stem and, eventually, leaves. All of this is bundled together and wrapped up in a seed coat. The seed coat is there to protect the contents of the seed, not only from physical harm, but also environmental damage. It's the seed coat that prevents the seed from germinating in the wrong conditions. </p> <p>On top of the seed coat, some seeds are also protected by fleshy tissue, such as fruits and hips. This tissue is usually there to entice an animal to take the seed elsewhere, so it has the chance to colonise new territory. Some seed is contained within capsules that delay seed dispersal until the seed is ripe. Think of the way a poppy seedhead doesn't open its apertures until the seed is ready to go. Catching your seed to save at the right moment of ripeness is essential - too immature and it won't have set itself up for life. A general indicator is that the seed has darkened and hardened. </p> <p>Most plants in your garden set seed at the end of the growing season, usually in autumn. This makes sense in terms of growing, but also poses a dilemma. This is the time of year when temperatures are lowering, while persistent rain, frost and snow are all to come. Clearly, this is not a wise time to germinate, hence the seed coat. The harder and tougher the seed coat, the more the plant is attempting to protect the seed from germinating at the wrong time, and the longer the seed will last. Tough seed coats are often impervious to water and need to soak in water before germination occurs. Think of a bean or pea - once the seed coat has softened with spring rain, the seed can spring into action. The architecture of the seed needs time to develop. </p> <h2>Storing seed</h2> <p>Some seeds, such as cowslips (Primula veris), need to be sown ripe for good germination, but most seed needs to be dried thoroughly. Wet seed rots, goes mouldy and quickly becomes unviable. If you time seed collecting correctly, nature will have dried your seed for you. But timing is everything: dry seed is quick to fall to the ground or off on to the wind, so you have to catch it just right. In some instances, particularly with perennials, it is better to take the whole seedhead off and dry the seed inside so that you don't lose any by missing the right moment. In a wet year, you'll need to take whole heads inside; for example, you will need to chop all your poppies down and take them indoors before they are fully ripe, otherwise the heads will rot. Hang these upside down over a bucket and the aperture will slowly open over a number of days to release the seed. </p> <p>Ideally, you should collect all seed in paper bags, as these will allow your seed to continue to dry. If you're collecting seed when you're out walking, just make a little paper wrap, as this will allow the seeds to breathe. </p> <p>Seeds may need cleaning before you can store them. From pine cones to pumpkins, nature has developed different fruiting bodies to protect unfertilised seeds and aid dispersal of ripe ones. Some seeds require little cleaning other than teasing off chaff. For columbines, love-in-the-mist, poppies and foxgloves, just tip, shake or split the capsule on to a piece of paper and collect the seed. Smaller, finer seed that is harder to extract can be rubbed through a fine sieve over a piece of paper. A lot of the finer seed from the daisy family Asteraceae, thistle-forming seedheads and lettuce seed can be cleaned this way. If you gently break up the seedhead, the seeds will fall through the sieve, leaving the chaff behind. </p> <p>Others are a little more involved. To clean seed from fleshy fruit, such as melons or pumpkins, scoop as much seed from the flesh as possible into a sieve. Using the back of a spoon, rub the seed into the sieve under running water until the flesh starts to come off. Once you have removed as much as possible, spread the seeds out on kitchen paper and let them dry before storing them. </p> <p>To get seed from most berries, simply put them into a fine sieve and squash them under running water until they are well mashed. Then put the fruit pulp into a jar of water and let it settle. The viable seed will sink and the flesh will float. Carefully pour out the liquid so that the seed stays in the jar. Dry the seed on kitchen paper and store it. </p> <p>Tomato seeds are surrounded by gelatinous gloop that is there to inhibit the seed from germinating in the tomato. This needs to be removed. You can ferment the seeds to clean them, but this method stinks and takes several days. I prefer a method that isn't organically approved, but far quicker. Cut your tomato in half and scoop out the seeds. Wash off the bulk of the jelly in a sieve. Put the seeds in a glass of water (roughly 250ml) and squirt in some washing-up liquid, or a sprinkling of soda crystals. Leave this overnight. Viable tomato seeds will sink to the bottom, but immature seeds will float. Scoop out any immature seeds and then strain the good seeds through a fine sieve. Leave the seeds to dry on coffee filter paper or a china plate - don't use kitchen paper, as you'll never get the little seeds unstuck. When dry, store the tomato seeds in an airtight container in the fridge or a cool place. </p> <p>All clean, dried seed should be stored in containers - sealed and labelled paper packets or old film canisters, small Tupperware or used plastic tubs with lids will work fine. If you've stored everything in envelopes or paper wraps, you should then put them into a plastic box with a lid, as airtight conditions are important. Store in the fridge at a temperature of 1-5C. If you <br>don't have space in your fridge, store your seed somewhere consistently dry and cool, as warm, humid conditions kill seed pretty quickly. As usual, to every rule there is an exception, and some seeds should not be allowed to dry out. Generally, large oily seeds such as acorns, walnuts and magnolia seeds need to be stored damp. If they dry out, they lose their ability to take up water again. Store this seed in vermiculite in a sealed plastic bag in the fridge. </p> <p>One word of warning - or perhaps of preparation. If you decide to collect seed, some cross-pollination (or hybridisation) is bound to have occurred. The bees, animals or wind that pollinate your plants don't care what varieties they are. Left alone, pink hellebores don't always produce pink hellebores and yellow courgettes may not produce yellow courgettes. So if you do want to get exactly the same plant again, you'll have to isolate its flowers from the attentions of unwanted visitors. </p> <p>Sowing seeds is usually the best way to fill your garden with annuals and biennials - the plants that grow, set their seeds and die within one or two seasons. This includes most vegetables and many flowers. But what about the longer-lived perennials such as bushes and trees, as well as some of our best-loved flowers such as geraniums, carnations and anemones. Here you'll have to use other methods of propagation. They may seem daunting, but you'll soon get the hang of them. </p> <h2>Division</h2> <p>This is the easiest form of propagation for all herbaceous perennials with fibrous roots, such as geraniums and hostas. With a few rare exceptions, you can't divide woody plants. You simply dig up one plant and pull or ease it apart, or slice it with a spade into several self-supporting ones. You can split a plant many times, but each section must have at least one bud or shoot and its own roots. If a plant is quite small, you can tease it apart by holding the sections just below the bud and pulling gently. This is quick, easy and will yield many small plants. It's a good way to bulk up well-developed, shop-bought plants: just take a perennial, divide and repot each section and wait till they get to a decent size to plant out. </p> <p>It is generally most useful to divide a plant when it has been growing for a few years, so that each section is a decent size. Nearly all perennials need dividing at some point in their lives in order to keep their growth vigorous. The rule of thumb is to divide every five years or so. </p> <p>You can divide at any of time of year, but if the weather's hot you'll have more work on your hands. That's why most people choose to divide in autumn or spring, when the plants are dormant and the soil still workable. Irises and spring-flowering plants are best divided in early summer after they've flowered. Plants that flower in early to mid summer are divided in autumn. Late summer- to early autumn-flowering plants are best divided in early spring, before they get going again. This applies to houseplants just the same as to those outdoors. </p> <p>If your plant is a large beast, such as a huge clump of geranium or a giant pampas grass, teasing it apart with your hands isn't an option. You can split an awful lot with a sharp spade; just hack a section out, making sure you have buds, roots and stems, and throw away any woody bits. For pampas grass and anything with really matted roots, try using a saw. Dig the plant up and saw it into sections. Replant all your divisions into new homes with good compost and water - this should kick-start them into new life. </p> <p>If you have ever owned a spider plant, you may already have practised something very similar to division, just by potting up one of the baby plants that sprout as \"runners\" from the parent. If not, simply take a baby spider and snip it off the plant. Put some peat-free, multipurpose compost in a pot, dib a hole about 2.5cm deep in the centre and place the baby spider plant in it. Firm the soil around the plant; if it doesn't look secure then you can pin it down with a paperclip bent into a U-shape. Water and place in a warm spot on a windowsill. </p> <p>You can use the same method for strawberries and other plants that produce runners. For those runners that don't develop roots while they're still on the mother plant, you'll have to peg the baby plant into a pot while it's still attached. Once it has rooted - usually after a few weeks -cut off the runner close to the new plant. </p> <h2>Cuttings</h2> <p>Most cuttings are taken from plant stems, but you can also take them from leaves or roots. Some plants want to root so badly that all you need to do is put a piece in a jar of water and they're off. Mint, coleus, watercress, penstemons, tradescantias and succulent begonias will all root this way. Just take a stem, cut off the lower leaves and make a clean cut across the base with a sharp knife, before putting the stem in a jar of water. Keep the jar topped up to keep the stems submerged and wait two to four weeks. Once the roots appear, pot young plants into good compost and water often for the first couple of weeks while the plant adjusts to its new life. Other plants need a little more persuasion and you can wait anything from two weeks to four months to get roots. All cuttings taken in late summer need to be protected from the cold over the winter, preferably in a cold frame. Plant them out in spring. </p> <h2>Woody plants</h2> <p>Softwood cuttings are taken from healthy young stems, usually from the first flush of growth in spring. These cuttings root readily, but because they have a lot of green growth they can easily dry out. Softwood cuttings are used to propagate mainly deciduous trees, shrubs and climbers, such as clematis, hydrangeas and deciduous viburnums. These should root in four to six weeks. </p> <p>A hardwood cutting is taken from something such as willow, dogwood, blackberries and flowering currants in late autumn. Look for this year's well-ripened (no longer soft) growth, and take 20cm lengths with a horizontal cut just below the node at the base of each cutting. Cuttings taken in autumn should have rooted by spring. </p> <h2>Nodal, stem-tip or soft-tip cuttings</h2> <p>It's traditionally recommended to take the tip of the stem as a cutting from perennials or non-woody plants. This is because it contains the powerhouse of new production - both the growing tip and the node where the rooting hormone is produced. </p> <p>Take cuttings from healthy shoots 8-13cm long. Cut just below a pair of leaves - at the node - with a clean sharp knife, then remove the lowest pair of leaves from your cutting. You do this because in all plants the natural growth hormones congregate at the node, just below a leaf joint. These hormones initiate the new roots. To speed things up you can dip the cuttings in rooting powder. Your cutting should have no more than one or two sets of leaves; any more will exhaust the new roots. </p> <p>Place cuttings around the edge of a 15cm pot, or in modules, filled with cutting or seed compost. Carefully firm in the cuttings and gently water. Cover the pot or modules with a plastic bag to maintain the humidity, but make sure the bag doesn't touch the cuttings, and keep them out of direct sunlight. Prime examples include pinks and carnations (Dianthus), penstemons, Michaelmas daisies, autumn-flowering chrysanthemums and sage (Salvia). Cuttings taken from side shoots on the lower part of a plant usually root better than cuttings taken from higher up. And thinner cuttings root faster than fat ones. </p> <p>Take cuttings early in the morning when plants are turgid, and if you don't have time to pot them straightaway, put the cuttings in a freezer bag, seal it and put them in the fridge to deal with later the same day. </p> <h2>Stem or internodal cuttings</h2> <p>Some plants root so readily that it's a shame to limit yourself just to the tip of the stem. Lobelias, asters, phygelius, salvias and penstemons are particularly willing to root, so why take just one cutting per stem when you could have so many more? The top of a stem cutting should be just above a set of leaves, the base just below a leaf. Each cutting needs to be at least 5-8cm long. Remove the bottom leaves so that you have sufficient length of bare stem to insert into the compost and treat exactly the same way as a nodal cutting. An advantage of internodal cuttings is that they tend to make bushier, better-quality plants. </p> <h2>Leaf cuttings</h2> <p>A limited number of plants can be propagated from leaves; most of these are houseplants such as African violets (Saintpaulia streptocarpus), rex begonias and mother-in-law's tongue (Sansevieria trifasciata). If you thought the spider plant was too easy, this is even better: just slice a mother-in-law's tongue leaf into small pieces, put them into soil and they'll grow again. </p> <p>Take a newly mature, healthy leaf and cut it off at the bottom of the plant. Now cut the leaf horizontally into 5cm sections, discarding the tip and the very bottom piece. Insert the cuttings into good potting compost in a seed tray or shallow box. It doesn't matter if the cuttings touch the sides, so cram them in. Keep the compost moist, but not wet, and place the cutting, uncovered, somewhere in bright but indirect light. They like moist warmth - around 21C - so a warm bathroom is ideal. The important thing is to make sure that all the cuttings are placed the right way up - the way the leaf was growing - rather than upside down. In six to eight weeks, new shoots and roots will appear. </p> <p>Variegated sansevierias - the ones with yellow margins - can be propagated only by division in early spring. If you propagate from leaf cuttings, they'll all come up green.</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Extracted from <strong>The Thrifty Gardener: How to Create a Stylish Garden for Next to Nothing </strong>by Alys Fowler, to be published by Kyle Cathie on September 25 at \u00a316.99.

  "<p>Bill Fuller, who has died aged 91, was widely regarded as the man who first brought rock music to London's Camden Town. Fuller, who built an empire of entertainment venues and hotels across the world - including the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town and San Francisco's Fillmore West - was an innovative Irishman whose colourful presence impacted on 70 years of the music business. Aside from his venues, Fuller ran a management and promotions company whose list of clients included Joe Loss, Billie Holiday, Patsy Cline and Johnny Cash. </p> <p>He was also instrumental in the rise of the Irish showband scene in the 1960s and was one of the few promoters who was able to get his bands into the then Mafia-stronghold of Las Vegas. \"I love to take risks,\" he once said. \"Life is a risk.\"</p> <p>Born in County Kerry, Fuller caught the boat train to London as a teenager to work on building sites. He developed his own construction business and took over a rundown Irish ballroom on Camden High Street when he was 20. A notorious rough house, the Buffalo had been forcibly closed down, but Fuller, a keen amateur boxer and wrestler, persuaded the local police chief to let him reopen it, promising that if he ever needed to call the constabulary he would personally close the hall down for good. Fuller manned the door himself and transformed the Buffalo into one of the most popular Irish ballrooms in the country.</p> <p>As a rural Irish immigrant, Fuller understood those who were looking for a place where they could meet, dance and find romance. In the 1950s, he built a chain of ballrooms across England and Ireland, while amassing some of his fortune from demolition.</p> <p>Indeed there was a saying about him at that time: \"What Hitler didn't knock down, Bill Fuller did.\"</p> <p>In September 1956, Fuller unveiled his global ambitions at Manhattan's City Center ballroom, which soon became the leading Irish dance hall in New York City, and he later opened ballrooms in Boston, Chicago and San Francisco. Regularly commuting an average of 6,000 miles a week between his many properties, Fuller found himself increasingly drawn to Las Vegas. In 1966, he managed to get one of his acts, the Royal Showband, a big break in the city. \"I remember Bill telling me about the day someone offered to introduce him to Elvis Presley,\" recalls his friend, Frank Murray, who would later manage the Electric Ballroom and Fuller's favourite band, the Pogues. 'He turned around and said: \"Fuck Elvis, I want to meet the Colonel.\" Fuller was clearly a player, and Vegas became home for the rest of his life.</p> <p>During the 1970s, Fuller sold off many of his ballrooms while converting others into rock venues. The Buffalo was renamed the Electric Ballroom in July 1978. The opening show featured various Sex Pistols and Thin Lizzy, and its stage has since seen Iggy Pop, the Clash, Joy Division, U2, the Smiths and Oasis. Fuller was full of surprises: he turned his attention to prospecting for gold and silver in western Nevada and after a lifetime avoiding publicity, he was suddenly thrust into the media spotlight at the age of 82, when he posted bail and paid extensive legal fees for Sandy Murphy, a Las Vegas stripper who was charged with murdering a wealthy casino owner, saying he was simply drawn to Murphy by her surname and an absolute conviction that she was innocent.</p> <p>Fuller lived an extraordinary life and will be remembered as an Irish gentleman. He always had time for his own people and never lost touch with his humble business beginnings. \"I'll keep Camden until I move out of this world,\" he told me when I interviewed him in 1996. \"It was the first place of my own that I had, so I wouldn't dream of parting with it. Camden will never be sold.\"</p> <p>Fuller was married three times - most publicly to the singer Carmel Quinn - and is predeceased by their son, Mike. He leaves four daughters, Mary, Jane, Terry and Kate, and two sons, Stephen and Sean.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> William (Bill) Joseph Fuller, businessman, born May 6 1917; died July 28 2008</p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>Progressive.</p> <p>\"It's a new generation who believe in opportunity for all and respect. I'm not your stereotypical Conservative in the sense that I grew up on a tough council estate in Banbury, with my mother putting up an election poster of Jim Callaghan in 79 \u2014 a fact I'm extremely embarrassed about!\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"We're open to much more scrutiny in that when Cameron announced two cuts, lo and behold, they suddenly reappear in the [current government's] agenda. That's the good thing about Cameron \u2013 he's shown himself to be a strong leader. Do I think people should choose how they spend their own money? Yes I do.\" </p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"In the end, I'd like to see cuts in public spending. There's a lot of waste that could be freed up without hitting front line services. But has the pendulum swung too far? Look at John Prescott \u2013 who's office had five press officers who released three press releases a year. We have a girl who produces three releases a day. This is a great example of that waste for me. There are 3,000 press officers in government \u2013 let's lose 2,500 of them and put 1,500 nurses into hospital for that money.\"</p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"I want my child, who isn't a year old yet, to grow up on a world that is safe and clean. I want the pregnant mother-of-one down the road to give her child the best food, organic, if that's the best. Let's just raise the basic threshold at which basic tax starts. We should keep the revenue from oil prices and divert that back into green energy \u2013 wind, wave etc. To me, in solving our energy crisis, tough decisions need to be made. Would a new wind farm spoil a beauty spot in Derbyshire \u2013 yes, but it's a necessary evil.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"I have never really sat down and thought about percentages. But working for a US software company, and very closely monitoring the dollar, we have to keep an eye on our global competition. Its not just about tax \u2013 we need to put money into research and development.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"I also keep an eye on the European operation. At my US-based company, I notice their desire to invest in each of the different countries in the EU. They find it very difficult to invest in France first and Germany, second, and that's because of employment legislation. Out of 14 guys, they'd put 12 in Britain, one in France and one in Germany. The truth is, we need to gain a connection with the electorate. But global trade helps ease the tension, helps us to hold each other to account.\"</p> <p>\"We shouldn't reform the CAP, we should scrap it. My view is that we signed up to a common market, not political union.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p> \"The average child sees their father for 18 minutes a day and we have a system that rewards and therefore encourages two people to live apart. That's crazy. Married couples shouldn't be penalised. Should same sex marriage be able to adopt, should they have the same tax (reforms)? Sure. The quality of parenting is the key here.\"<br> <br></p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"Coming from a poor estate, I've seen many girls get pregnant. I absolutely believe in a woman's right to choose. But is the current limit too high? Yes \u2013 I'd go between 20-22 weeks.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Johnny McDevitt</strong></p>",
  "<p>Animal Aid is dismayed by the Marine Conservation Society's \"fish to avoid\" guide, which claims certain fish species can be caught \"sustainably\" (Over pizzas, over salads but now overfished: demise of the anchovy, September 4). Those species now on the unsustainable and depleted lists were also once regarded as plentiful. As Philip MacMullen points out: \"Fish stocks are dynamic and can change their status quite quickly.\" Ethical consumers who wish to choose environmentally friendly food would be better steering clear of fish entirely.</p> <p>Far from alleviating the problem, fisheries add to the pressure on wild fish populations. Many of the smaller fish species caught on commercial fishing boats are processed into pellets for factory-farmed fish. It takes around five tons of wild-caught fish to grow one ton of farmed fish - a wholly unsustainable practice. We must act now for the sake of the environment and the fish themselves.<br><strong>Kelly Slade</strong><br>Campaigns officer, Animal Aid</p>",
  "<p>The government unveiled a new strategy for manufacturing yesterday that aims to boost skills, exploit the opportunities of a low-carbon economy and bolster the sector's image as an exciting place to work.</p> <p>The new framework emphasises manufacturing's key role in a mixed and balanced economy and argues that Britain can become a world leader in nuclear and renewables, where some 260,000 jobs could be created over the next decade.</p> <p>New Challenges, New Opportunities, which replaces the government's 2002 manufacturing strategy, wants to see a further boost to the number of manufacturing apprenticeships and pledges further support for some 600 companies looking for opportunities in India and China.</p> <p>A new body, Manufacturing Insight, will be given the job of selling the sector as \"successful, modern and broad\" and an exciting place to work.</p> <p>John Hutton, the business secretary, said: \"Manufacturing is central to the success of the UK economy and it is vital the sector has the right foundations to endure the current economic slowdown and emerge stronger and fitter than ever.\"</p> <p>The plan, which has been drawn up by the Department for Business and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, in partnership with industry, will be backed by \u00a3150m of medium-term support for UK manufacturing.</p> <p>Hutton said the UK was the world's sixth-largest manufacturer, with the sector accounting for over half the UK's exports, employing about 3 million people and contributing \u00a3150bn towards the economy. But he added: \"We need to recognise that the global landscape is changing so we can help UK manufacturers stay ahead of the game.</p> <p>\"I want the UK to be at the forefront of opportunities opened up by the move towards a low-carbon economy. With the right support in place, we can grow our nuclear and renewables industries to become world leaders in green technologies, supporting hundreds of thousands of green-collar jobs.\"</p> <p>The new strategy was broadly welcomed by both sides of industry.</p> <p>Brendan Barber, TUC general secretary, said: \"Its call for a mixed and balanced economy, including a strong manufacturing sector, will be greeted with enthusiasm by unions. We particularly welcome plans for an additional 1,500 apprenticeships and the recognition of the role that public procurement can play in promoting a healthy manufacturing sector. We look forward to a separate low-carbon industrial strategy in 2009.\"</p> <p>Martin Temple, chairman of the EEF manufacturers' organisation, said it backed the strategy. \"The next step is to deliver and back the positive words with firm actions of intent and support.\"</p> <p>The CBI's chief economic adviser, Ian McCafferty, also stressed the need to translate policy into practice. \"The government's new framework contains some fresh thinking ... It must now deliver on its plans.\" </p> <p>However, there was criticism from the Conservatives. The shadow business secretary, Alan Duncan, said: \"While other countries like Germany have been successfully building whole new industries based on low-carbon technologies, the UK has lost over a million manufacturing jobs since 1997, while our green-energy sector remains tiny.\"</p>",
  "<p>Retail sales suffered almost across the board last month due to the bad weather and low consumer confidence, while the housing market remained in the doldrums, according to two key surveys published today. The surveys' findings reinforce the idea that the economy is slowing rapidly.</p> <p>The British Retail Consortium reported that sales fell 1% last month compared with August last year on a like-for-like basis, which strips out the impact of increases in floor space.</p> <p>\"Record-low consumer confidence and increasing demands on household budgets meant shoppers looked for value and planned spending carefully to take advantage of the widespread promotions and discounts. Housing market weakness continued to hit big-ticket homewares,\" said the BRC.</p> <p>It pointed to the rainy weather in August as being a major deterrent to consumers going shopping.</p> <p>\"Miserable weather washed out hopes of a summer boost for retailers,\" said Stephen Robertson, the BRC's director general. \"Annual like-for-like sales fell in five of the last six months, the first time this has happened since 2005. Even food sales growth slowed. Footwear was the only other sector where sales rose, boosted by children's shoe sales.\"</p> <p>Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight, was not surprised by the figures. \"Consumers are being hit by a myriad of factors, notably muted disposable income growth, a serious squeeze on purchasing power coming from sharply rising utility bills and elevated food prices, tight credit conditions, higher mortgage repayments, sharply falling house prices, higher debt levels and rising unemployment.\"</p> <p>There is further gloomy news today from the latest Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' monthly snapshot of the housing market. It shows the number of transactions has hit its lowest level since the survey began in 1978. Mortgage approvals are down more than 70% in the past year.</p> <p>\"A lack of mortgage liquidity is the key issue,\" Rics' spokesman, Jeremy Leaf, said. \"The government's stamp duty policy will not be enough to kickstart transactions and is more likely to assist buy-to-let investors. More needs to be done to reinvigorate a market whose confidence has taken a severe knock.\"</p> <p>The survey's price balance picked up marginally for the fourth month in a row but still a balance of 81% of surveyors reported a fall in prices rather than a rise - compared with the record low of 95% set in April.</p>",
  "<p>Stock markets were in jubilant mood yesterday after the US treasury announced it was putting the two big beasts of the American mortgage market into \"conservatorship\". Don't be misled by this ugly piece of economics jargon: it's just another way of saying nationalisation - and it was somewhat bizarre to find the equity markets of Tokyo, London and New York, where dealers profess to exalt the free market, whooping for joy at the state taking a grip.</p> <p>The reason for the rise in share prices was pure relief. Just as they were at the time of the run on Northern Rock a year ago this week, just as they were when Bear Stearns went under in March - and just as they were at the end of last week - stock markets have been in a complete funk at the mounting losses from the credit crisis. Hank Paulson, secretary of the US treasury, did not take Fannie May and Freddie Mac into public ownership because he has become a born-again socialist: he acted because he feared a systemic global financial crisis that would prompt the biggest depression since the 1930s.</p> <p>There are five points to note. The first is the sheer scale of the action. Fannie and Freddie together underwrite half the home loans in the world's biggest economy, and the sum involved is of the order of \u00a33 trillion - about double the entire annual output of the British economy. This is the biggest rescue operation since the credit crunch began - but it probably won't be the last.</p> <p>The second point is the duration of the crisis. When markets seized up in August 2007, few market practitioners would have anticipated that central banks and finance ministries around the world would still be firefighting 13 months later. Central banks have cut interest rates; they have pumped money into the banking system; they have agreed to swap worthless mortgage-backed securities for rock-solid government bonds; they have taken failing banks into public ownership. Each time, the markets have rallied in the hope that the latest crisis will prove to be a catharsis - and each time they have been proved wrong. Some analysts do not buy the argument that Paulson's rescue marks the beginning of the end for the credit crunch; some say it was an act of desperation necessitated by the horrendous state of the global financial system.</p> <p>Whatever the motivation, the third point to make is that the government-backed rescue of Fannie and Freddie was right. The length and depth of the credit crunch has validated the views of the International Monetary Fund, George Soros and Alistair Darling that this is the most serious financial crisis the global economy has faced since the 30s. Fannie Mae was set up in that decade as part of the New Deal reforms to help the US economy recover from the depression. With almost perfect symmetry, the decision to take it into public ownership highlights the bankruptcy of the freewheeling model that replaced the much more heavily regulated financial system of the decades after the second world war. Let's be clear: the world is in the mess it is today not because state regulation of the banks was too stringent, but because the state was too timid in the face of demands for deregulation, liberalisation and privatisation. The upshot was excessive speculation, and economies in which the financial sector wields far too much influence and reward structures invite foolishness.</p> <p>As such, the question is what happens now. The fourth conclusion to be drawn is that the free market has no answers to the problem other than to let banks go to the wall. But no policymaker, even those with the most impeccable laissez-faire background, is prepared to let Bear Stearns, Northern Rock or Freddie and Fannie go bust. Some smaller institutions may be allowed to go to the wall, if only to show the US treasury is aware that the bailouts are being financed by taxpayers, but the global financial community now has institutions that are simply too big to fail.</p> <p>But if the big financial institutions cannot - unlike, say, a car company or an airline - be allowed to founder, they also cannot be allowed to conduct themselves in the same way as companies where there really is a risk of failure. Congress will undoubtedly demand tougher regulations for the activities of US banks in exchange for bailing them out, and rightly so. If ever there was a time to bring in controls on the ability of banks to create unlimited amounts of credit, to restrict the more toxic forms of derivatives, to rein in the activities of hedge funds, to insist that remuneration structures are not biased in favour of reckless speculation, and to use anti-trust law to break up the power of the big institutions then this, surely, is it.</p> <p>This leads on to the final point. The credit crunch should be a crisis for parties of the right. They were, after all, behind the campaign to demolish controls on financial markets in the final quarter of the 2oth century. Yet there is scant evidence that either the Republicans in the US or the Tories in Britain will pay a price for the policy errors of the past. In part, that is because in the US the whiff of a return to the soup-kitchen days of the depression brings out the interventionist streak in any administration. In part, though, it is because neither Barack Obama nor Gordon Brown seem willing to seize the social democratic moment. That's dumb politics. It means that what should be a crisis for the right has become a crisis for the left.</p> <p>Larry Elliott is economics editor of the Guardian. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

After 56 hours of deliberations the jurors were hung on the central charge.</p> <p>By majority verdicts, the jury convicted the three men of conspiracy to commit murder. They were the cell's ringleader, Abdulla Ahmed Ali, the bombmaker Assad Sarwar, and Tanvir Hussain.</p> <p>They had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause explosions. </p> <p>One defendant, Mohammed Gulzar, whom the Crown alleged flew into Britain from Pakistan to oversee the plot, was acquitted of all charges.</p> <p>The jury failed to reach verdicts on four other defendants, who had earlier admitted conspiracy to cause a public nuisance by making al-Qaida style suicide videos.</p> <p>The alleged airline plot was disrupted in August 2006 when the men were arrested. The discovery of the cell and what counter-terrorism officials say was an al-Qaida inspired suicide mission led to weeks of chaos at airports in Britain and the US.</p> <p>The restrictions on liquids travellers can take in their hand luggage as a result of the allegations remain in force today. The additional security measures brought in since the arrests continue to cause disruption and delays at the UK's busiest airports.</p> <p>Last night the government was under pressure from the airlines and Britain's largest airport owner to review its airport security regime in the light of the verdicts. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic and BAA said the government should consider lifting the ban on carrying large amounts of liquids in hand luggage. </p> <p>Ali, Sarwar and Hussain will be sentenced on October 3, and the Crown Prosecution Service has until late this month to decide what it will do over the charges on which the jury failed to reach a verdicts.</p> <p>The eight men - seven from London and one from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire - had denied the charges.</p> <p>The Crown said the men planned to smuggle the parts of a liquid bomb on to passenger planes. These liquid components would be disguised in soft drinks bottles to bypass airport security. Once on board, the devices would be assembled.</p> <p>Tests by government scientists, played to the jury, produced videos of the devices producing an explosion powerful enough to punch a hole in an aircraft fuselage.</p> <p>The Crown believed it had overwhelming evidence. Six of the men recorded suicide videos making threats against the west, which the prosecution said would have been released after the planes were blown up in mid-air.</p> <p>The security service MI5 had captured incriminating statements with covert listening and video devices planted in the east London flat which the cell used as a bomb factory.</p> <p>US and UK intelligence believe the cell was directed by al-Qaida leaders in Pakistan.</p> <p>Liquid explosives were to have been hidden in Lucozade and other soft drinks bottles. Disposable cameras would have been used to help set off the devices which would also contain regular batteries, hollowed out to contain chemicals.</p> <p>In their defence, Ali and Sarwar said they planned to record a documentary highlighting injustices against Muslims in Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon.</p> <p>Ali said he considered exploding a small device at the Houses of Parliament or Heathrow's terminal three as a publicity stunt to draw attention to the programme.</p> <p>He claimed martyrdom videos recorded by six of the defendants were a hoax to be used as part of the internet documentary to make it more shocking.</p> <p>In April while opening its case, the Crown played videos of Ali found after his arrest. In it he warned of \"body parts ... decorating the streets\" if Muslims were not left alone, and said he had yearned to take part in violent jihad since he was a teenager. In the martyrdom video he is seen speaking against the backdrop of a black flag with Arabic writing on it. Last night the CPS said: \"The prosecution is considering the request for a retrial in respect of the plot to blow up airliners against all seven men upon which the jury could not agree.\"</p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said: \"I am indebted to the police and security services who, by successfully disrupting this group, have saved countless lives. I would also thank the Crown Prosecution Service, which has worked tirelessly to ensure that these individuals have been brought to justice. I am sure they will now consider what to do where no verdict was reached.\"</p> <p>The trial judge, David Calvert-Smith, excused the jurors from any further service for the rest of their lives and offered his appreciation. \"Depart this court with the full-hearted thanks of the community for your service to it, which is far beyond the duty for most jurors, and my personal thanks,\" he told them.</p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"Yes, I believe in compassionate Conservatism. I think we should reform the tax and benefits system so that it is fairer and more efficient. For example, I think we should look at tax breaks for working people who look after a sick, disabled, or elderly relative. We should also look at increasing the carer's allowance in order to make it more like a living wage. If people could afford to leave work in order to absorb such family responsibilities then that would in turn have a significant impact on the number of people in nursing care and along with it, government spending. I have long held the view that this makes both moral and economic sense.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"I don't think any of us truly knows what state the public finances will be in until we get there, so Cameron is wise not to be making any promises that he cannot be sure of keeping. I am confident that Cameron will take whatever fiscal measures are necessary in order to stimulate the economy when he becomes prime minister.\"</p> <h2>3.

After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"I do not have a crystal ball, but I am aware that we have significant commitments which will have to be met, particularly to our armed forces, and Liam Fox [the shadow defence secretary] has been right to stick his neck out and say kitting out our servicemen and women should come before any tax cuts. I think it is a historical fact that Conservative governments deliver lower taxes and more efficient public services than Labour and the Liberals, and I see no reason why that would not be the case under a government led by David Cameron.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"It is well-known that I am not comfortable with our membership of the EU in its current form. We should renegotiate our terms of membership, reclaim powers over fisheries, agriculture, legislation, fiscal policy, self-government, and reassert our status as a sovereign, self-governing nation state.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"Although I come from a single-parent family I believe the tax system should be reformed to better recognise and promote marriage, as we must accept that a stable married family generally offers the best environment in which to bring up children. If you are serious about tackling family breakdown, then you must shore up marriage. This also offers the benefit of more freedom in society, as a fully functioning family is less dependant on the state, which in turn frees resources to be used for the long-term sick, disabled, and the elderly, who are now facing a cold winter with prohibitive fuel costs.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"Naturally, this is a matter of individual conscience. In principle, I support halving the upper limit, from 24 weeks to 12 weeks, particularly as premature babies born at 24 weeks can survive. However, any reduction from where we are now would be progress. I am also not comfortable that abortion can be seen as a method of contraception, although, of course, there are always exceptional cases.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Mark Gould</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"Yes and it's about having a vision for society that is fairer and more equal and much more socially mobile that it is now. We have always been progressive; 30 years ago we offered people the chance to buy their own homes that had never dreamed of being able to do that before. I grew up in a working-class part of Plymouth, now I am deputy leader of Coventry council and a PPC [prospective parliamentary candidate]. I want more of that and I believe that the Conservatives offer more of us the chance to move on.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"What George Osborne has said is that people want stable finances. Of course in the long term [we are] the party of low tax.

Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"Stay in. I used to work for the European parliament and I think that we have gained a lot. I was born in 1978 when you could be shot for trying to cross the Berlin Wall. That has disappeared due to a strong Europe. We have also gained from free trade and commerce but we have lost out in terms of the common agriculture policy, common fisheries and the waste and bureaucracy of the European parliament.\" </p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"David Cameron has already said that the key thing about tax and benefits at the moment is that they are linked to keeping couples apart who want to stay together. We need to reward people for staying together. I had a stable loving family and that helped me get where I am now.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"Abortion is always a difficult one and I am glad that it is a free vote. I would have voted for 20 or 22 weeks myself. Babies survive far before 24 weeks now, but I respect those that have different views.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Mark Gould</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"Yes. The whole party has moved on. That was recognised when David Cameron became leader. He has the right policies and people are now prepared to listen to them. They didn't at the last election when I stood in Dartford. People didn't want to listen then, but they do now.</p> <p>\"He talks about things that we never dared talk about before, such as environmental issues \u2013 Gordon Brown never spoke about the environment until David Cameron spoke. Basically we are taking a lead in areas that should be Lib Dem or Labour territory.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"We are always going to be the party of lower taxation. The progressive thing is that we have accepted that we have to look after schools, hospitals and law and order first.\"</p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"What we need to do is safeguard expenditure on schools, hospitals and fighting crime before we offer too much in the way of tax cuts. We need to ensure public services are properly safeguarded before we go down that route. Too often people have equated [Tory] tax cuts with cuts in public expenditure. We have never been successful in convincing people that you <em>can</em> have tax cuts without sacrificing schools, hospitals and law and order.\"</p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"George Osborne has made it clear that green taxes should not be a substitute for stealth taxes. There need to be positive benefits from any green taxes. The vehicle excise duty increase was nothing to do with the environment and everything to do with taxation by stealth. Any increased green taxes need to be offset by benefits elsewhere.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"There are loads of ifs and buts in this question. All we can say is that it's important to have a strong economy and good quality public services with lower taxation. I can't see six years into a future; we just don't know what the books are gong to be like when we get in.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"We have gained but only just because with Nato it has helped secure peace in Europe and that is the biggest benefit. On balance it's in Britain's interest to remain in. Of course if it really ceased to be in our interest we might have to think again.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"I would like to see marriage recognised in the taxation system. All evidence suggests that children who are brought up in a family unit are healthier and happier and have less exclusion from schools.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"I think there should be some more restriction on the legal limit. I think it should be a bit lower than 24 weeks.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Mark Gould</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"Absolutely. I come from the St Anne's estate in Nottingham, the scene of a lot of this terrible gun crime, and a lot of the Labour polices are so driven by ideology that they have kept people down. We want to create equal opportunity in terms of jobs and education; that's what progressive means. For example in education why should it be done in the same old way? It's all about what works best. </p> <p>\"We think Blair was too moderate. He did what he could get away with; it was a mild version of what he wanted to do. We will go a lot further, not having this nonsense where the unions want to run everything. I am a Nottinghamshire county councillor and we have some of the lowest performing schools. </p> <p>\"We regularly hear councillors at meetings blaming us [the Tories] for the problems. If it wasn't for the Conservatives, I am sure they would blame the Romans next.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"I think we all have a responsibility to pay taxes - that's why we are Tories - but I don't know what we will be taking over when we take over so we can't say too much now about what taxes should be cut. It will be about looking at what the taxes are and who they affect the most. The people on the borderline and the most vulnerable should be helped first. We also need to reform the tax system to make it simpler and more easy to use; there are so many pages it's like the Encyclopedia Britannica. No wonder so many companies are suffering. Where there are tax cuts it's got to be morally right and economically effective.\"</p> <h2>3.

Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"You look at the amount of money that has been spent in Europe, it's difficult to say we haven't benefited in one shape or form but I think it must refocus on broader issues such as global warming, tackling pollution, rather than telling us our bananas are the wrong shape or having Tony Blair as president \u2013 that's ridiculous. I think we have to stay in but I'd like a referendum to find out what people really feel.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"Absolutely A. As a county councillor I represent people in the bottom 6% of deprivation. I know that people are living together but simply for tax and benefit reasons they say they are apart [living in separate houses]. They are given more incentive to stay apart than live together.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"This is such a difficult subject and my knowledge is very scarce but I think that medical evidence says that babies can live at much younger than 24 weeks so I would have gone for 20 or 22 weeks.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Alexandra Topping</strong></p> <p>\u0095 This article was amended on September 12 2008 after a complaint that it did not accurately reflect the views of the candidate. </p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive?</h2> <p>\"Yes, I am progressive. 'Progressive' is about supporting new ideas and social change. I will always listen to new ideas as we often have to look for new solutions to issues as society changes over time. We do, though, have to learn from the past and use history and experience to help make decisions for the future. </p> <p>\"Two of the most progressive ideals are social justice and equal opportunities. I believe in social justice. It is wrong to turn a blind eye to a society which is broken by the injustices of family breakdown, drug and alcohol addiction, failed education and serious personal debt. </p> <p>\"These are the new 'five giants' of our age. I am a progressive because I will work to harness the power of the state, voluntary organisations and social enterprises to work with the people to fight this multiple deprivation which is plaguing our country. Labour believes society's problems can only be solved by the state. That has failed. Society's problems can only be solved by people in local communities. </p> <p>\"I have also campaigned for many years for the Conservative party to get more women in parliament but strongly believe it should be done so based on merit. I believe in creating opportunities for all - no matter who they are or where they come from. I believe in rehabilitation of offenders and working with them to change their behaviour and supporting them on their release so that they do not reoffend. I want to see additional help for those from more disadvantaged backgrounds to get the best education possible, so that they can aspire and achieve their dreams.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"The Conservative party has always been a party of low tax and always will be. I want people to keep more of the money their hard work has earned them. However, with an extremely tough economy ahead of us for the next year, I do not think David Cameron can promise any unfunded tax cuts right now. No-one knows, not even the MPC, how bad the economy will get in the months ahead and therefore it would not be right for David to promise something he cannot deliver. We need to set an example of living within our means. Stability has to be the key right now. The aim will be to cut taxes when the time is right.\"</p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"I will always believe in low taxation! We will find money when the time is right to do so, by tackling the current waste of public spending that takes place in government.\"</p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"As a party we will try and rebalance taxation - shift the burden of taxation away from 'good' things like families and on to 'bad' things like pollution and carbon emissions, so that overall taxes do not increase. Also, I want to live in a community with a good quality of life. In my constituency that means fighting to stop the expansion of Heathrow, and the pollution, noise and congestion that goes along with it.\"</p> <h2>5.

It is uncertain because of the global impact and the credit crunch but also due to the mess that Gordon Brown has made of the public finances. Looking forward, we cannot write the 2014 budget now. What I am concerned about is how to ease the tax burden on hard-working families who are feeling the pinch now. We have already announced some policies which help hard-pressed families, eg cutting stamp duty for first-time buyers on purchases up to \u00a3250k, raising the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m and ending the couple penalty in the tax credits system. This is a real difference to what Labour have done. Some of their tax rises have been extremely regressive, eg abolition of the 10p tax band and the increases to road tax.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"The EU has succeeded in bringing the countries of Europe together to ensure peace and prosperity in a once-troubled continent. The single market and the enlargement of the EU were promoted by Margaret Thatcher. We now have free movement of services, people, workers and goods. But the EU should not have pretensions to intervene in every part of our lives. It should concentrate on doing less, but doing it better. I would want to repatriate some powers back to the UK so that we are more in control of what we do. I would like the EU to do more on free trade with the third world so that we can support countries like Mozambique to be economically self-sufficient. The EU should concentrate on making a difference where they can: global warming, global competitiveness and global poverty.\" </p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"We will aim to help all parents - but we need to address any current issues, eg it is not right that in our benefits system couples receive more money if they live apart. In this way, we will be recognising and promoting marriage.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"Yes, it should be reduced to 18 weeks.

  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>Progressive.</p> <p>\"I find it easy to line up behind David Cameron. We all have these collective ideas and he's at the <em>front</em> of that line, not defining what that line should think. We're a progressive party and nobody should forget that \u2013 in her day, [Margaret] Thatcher was progressive. We have a vision, just as [Tony] Blair did on that bright, sunny day in 1997, when the birds actually sang a little louder, but <em>with</em> policies. I'm not sure he had any.</p> <h2>2 Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"We need to look at the benefits system that has reached a stage where some people can see living on benefits as a viable career option. We need to show people that there are other ways to lead a productive life. I work with the seventh most deprived ward in Worcester.

We need to get people back into jobs by making sure the jobs and the training necessary are there.\"</p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"I'm happy to spend money on public services, as long as it is done so wisely. We need to redistribute in terms of avoiding hammering the rich on poor people. I'd usually avoid using the term, but we need a meritocracy. As an overall principle, if you ask people \u2013 there's a great club called Great Britain, which they can subscribe to \u2013 it provides roads, railways, healthcare etc \u2013 if you ask them 'Are you happy with the tax you're paying now?' they would probably say 'yes'.\" </p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"I live in the country and do a huge mileage \u2013 30,000 miles every year. But I need to do that mileage \u2013 this is the nature of the countryside \u2013 people need their 4x4s. So while we may all be using 'nudge politics' \u2013 making people feel guilty about environmental issues \u2013 taxes have to factor into the changing of attitudes toward the environment. So I'm happy to look at tax increases, but think that redistribution is the realistic idea.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be: <br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"We'd want to cut taxes, but that will take a long period of time, if we're looking at two parliaments. We should set our sights on 35%, but I do not advocate achieving that by trimming the funds of national security and services etc.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"My mother was a Ukip candidate for St Ives in 1997, so you can imagine that we are constantly debating over Europe. Coming from the City, where there are mainly European and American banks, I saw the ultimate reflection of Europe. With those banks we have trading blocks that bring a great many things to the UK. Those trading blocks provide self-help in the economy. But it's the laws that are weighing us down. The French have an advantage in that they simply ignore European bureaucracy, because they have recognised that there are certain things that are distasteful about Europe. Here, 70% of the laws coming in are of European origin and that is simply not right.</p> <p>\"Without a shadow of a doubt, the public should have their say on Europe. Labour promised a vote, as they did with top-up fees, and by not fulfilling that promise they've broken the public's trust, and we will not do that.\" </p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"The family unit, in my opinion, is the most important building block in society. To that end I can't see a better unit \u2013 one that is created by love and affection \u2013 that should be more universally encouraged. Again, we are using nudge politics to say that if you're prepared to make that commitment, you will be rewarded. But, yes, I must admit, it would be seen as single-parent families being penalised.</p> <p>\"Is it moralising? I want to answer that question, but I'll choose my words carefully \u2026 There used to be a time where the church used to moralise, but in the absence of the church being listened to, is it right that politicians should take their place? Its not moralising, but I could see why people could see it that way.\"<br> <br></p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"I can see why the pro-lifers have their position. I was once asked about the issue, and I said 12 weeks, but have since changed my mind. Most abortions tend to happen fairly early on, so I believe that this issue shouldn't have particularly far-reaching consequences. However, if there is still a significant number that occur around the 19-week mark, I would question reducing the weeks too far. Obviously, the topic needs to be balanced with rights for women. What is crucial though is to look at the fact that abortions are increasingly becoming a replacement for contraception and we need to address this source so that abortion issues become less significant.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Johnny McDevitt</strong></p>",
  "<p>The dramatic nationalisation of US mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae should help to put a floor under the weak US housing market that was the cause of their problems in the first place.</p> <p>US house prices have been falling for about three years and are now down by 25%-30%. The pace of decline has shown signs of easing recently, but figures out as recently as Friday showed why the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, moved swiftly to take the two lending giants into \"conservatorship\" at the weekend.</p> <p>The Mortgage Bankers Association said that the number of mortgages entering the foreclosure process jumped to 1.2% in the second quarter of the year, the first time since records began in 1979 that the figure had exceeded 1%. The share of mortgage loans overdue by 30 days or more rose to 6.4% and almost a quarter of them were prime loans, showing that the problem is spreading well beyond the sub-prime sector where the downturn began. In addition, 9.1% of single-family homes were in foreclosure or more than 30 days overdue, up from 6.5% a year ago and the worst figure for 39 years.</p> <p>\"These numbers are mind-numbing. The MBA data released on Friday provided added impetus for a quick response to this latest chapter of the mortgage crisis. [But] the government continues to react to events because they have been unable to get ahead of them,\" said David Rosenberg, US analyst at Merrill Lynch.</p> <p>He said that the US government's cash injection and support for the mortgage-backed securities market, in which the two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) were so heavily involved, should help the two giants to lend mortgages at lower rates of interest and support the housing market. \"Now that they have been taken over, the GSEs will be able to fund mortgages at a cost that is practically indistinguishable from Treasury rates. This is the real benefit from the takeover.\" </p> <p>Brian Bethune, chief US economist at Global Insight, said that mortgage rates should fall soon. \"While the takeover is bad news for existing shareholders, it will be good news for American households who are either looking to purchase a home for the first time, or refinance their existing mortgage.\"</p> <p>The latest report on US house prices by Global Insight last week showed that the speed of decline in the US housing market slowed in the second quarter and prices were down less than 5% from a year ago.</p> <p>No one is yet talking about rises in prices although there is now hope they may find a floor as a result of the nationalisation. But with US unemployment still rising fast, many homeowners are still handing back the keys, and few analysts are ruling out further house price falls.</p>",
  "<p>Most foreign stockmarkets soared but the nationalisation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provoked a muted response on Wall Street. The Dow Jones index wobbled around in positive territory for most of the day without gaining much upwards momentum. What do they know in New York?</p> <p>Well, they can see immediately that the bail-out is better for foreign investors, who hold Fannie and Freddie bonds, than for US regional banks, who are stuffed to the gills with Fannie and Freddie preference shares that are now almost worthless.</p> <p>The bonds have now been elevated to a status close to that of US treasury bills. The bondholders would argue that it is only right and proper: the debt was sold with an implicit US government backing that has now been made explicit. Any other outcome would have risked a run on the dollar.</p> <p>But the blow to preference shareholders can't be ignored. The regional banks will have to recognise their losses at a time when their capital ratios are already damaged. The parlous state of the sector was illustrated only yesterday as Washington Mutual, an important second-tier lender, fired its chief executive and said its operations had been put under special regulatory supervision.</p> <p>Yet the US authorities, one assumes, would like the regional lenders to be part of a long-term solution to the US mortgage crisis. Hank Paulson, US treasury secretary, said the operations of Fannie and Freddie would be wound down gradually from 2010. Given that the duo guarantee half the home loans in the US, an enormous vacuum will be created. The US, in effect, is having to invent a new mortgage model in the middle of a housing and banking crisis.</p> <p>Where is the new capital going to come from? Who would want to invest before a new system of US banking regulation - a question that can't be dodged after the failure of Fannie and Freddie - has been hammered out? </p> <p>The survivors among the US banks will fill the gap eventually but it's simply unrealistic to expect this cavalry to arrive soon. It may be that the US government will be running the US mortgage market for years to come. No wonder Paulson, back in July, was so keen to offer support for Fannie and Freddie \"in their current form\".</p> <p>The ambition has proved impossible to achieve and David Rosenberg, Merrill Lynch's north American economist, is not alone in thinking the weekend bail-out, though necessary, also gives the appearance that the US government has continually under-estimated the strains created by the credit bubble. </p> <p>\"We find it difficult to see how it is bullish that the heavy hand of government is needed to such an extent,\" says Rosenberg. \"In our view, the takeover of Fannie and Freddie is actually a testament to how broken the financial system is.\"</p> <p>So, yes, it's clearly possible that nationalisation will provide a short-term boost to market sentiment - the biggest financial risk has been removed and US mortgage rates might now fall. But consider the wider picture: the US government is having to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to restore the confidence of overseas investors. In the end, that sounds bad for the dollar and expensive for US citizens.</p> <h2>Trading troubles</h2> <p>Thanks to some whizz-bang new technology, the London Stock Exchange boasts that it executes trades in milliseconds. But not yesterday. In fact, for most of the day, no trades were executed at all. Nor did the LSE provide an adequate explanation for its \"connectivity\" problems. A proper statement is expected today, 24 hours too late.</p> <p>We can only speculate whether or not the surge in demand created by the bail-out of Fannie and Freddie was the cause. Either the LSE's systems can't cope with a big day in the markets, or they could have fallen over at any time. Neither explanation reflects well. </p> <p>The LSE's rivals - Turquoise, Chi-X, Nasdaq OMX Europe, Plus Markets - could not have hoped for a more timely gift. \"The emergence of new trading platforms should test the attractiveness of our services,\" wrote Clara Furse, the LSE's chief executive, in Monday's FT. She's right about that.</p> <p>The episode also damages the LSE's hopes of securing partnership deals with Middle Eastern stock exchanges. It has lost out on a few deals already and it's now harder to see how the LSE will prosper in what Furse rightly describes as a \"global marketplace\".</p> <p>Back in London, users want a simple answer to a simple question: why doesn't the LSE run a back-up system? When an explanation arrives, the question can't be dodged if the exchange is to repair yesterday's damage.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>In the sparse Yorkshire office of Stuart Andrew there is a poster above his desk announcing Friday is Casual Sex Day. Andrew, the Conservative candidate for Pudsey, once defected to Labour on account of Conservative homophobia but has since felt able to return. He's the son of a single mother, raised on a council estate, and the successful head of fundraising for a children's hospice. Andrew wants any tax cuts to be targeted at the poor first.</p> <p>It may only be slightly at odds with his mother's battles - a tricky divorce leaving her alone to bring up four boys - but Andrew thinks marriage should be recognised in the tax system and believes men should not adopt children. \"I always think of how the kid will be bullied at school.\"</p> <p>As for abortion, he would like to see a change because he has experience of the high quality of life severely ill children have, \"and working with children who have life-limiting illnesses also means I'd like to see a reduction in the upper limit of abortion\". Andrew calls himself a progressive and would cite his concern for the poorest in society, but is back to the future on family life - he's a progressive Conservative. </p> <p>Andrew was one of 66 Conservative candidates in winnable seats to take part in a survey conducted by the Guardian. His views are much in tune with many other candidates. All those polled regard themselves as \"progressive\", though many recast the term in thoroughly conservative language, as if still wrestling with David Cameron's depiction of the Tories as the \"true champions for progressive ideals\" in Britain.</p> <p>Those questioned favoured a reduction on the upper limit on abortion - 83% back any reduction, 61% a reduction to at least 22 weeks - with a handful wanting it banned. </p> <p>Of those who could be drawn on tax cuts, 44% think low tax is desirable but not until the end of the first parliament. Ten took the opportunity to say that the first tax cuts should be for the poorest in society. And despite being a Conservative and in principle wanting lower taxes, 68% of the progressive Conservative cohort supports its party's ambition to increase green taxes. The last surprise: a majority - 80% - think the UK has gained from being in Europe. They are Tory but they are new Tories too. </p> <p>The Guardian's team contacted candidates selected for the 200 most winnable seats to try and tease out the views of the likely new intake. </p> <p>While not all of them will make it to Westminster, many of them will. Nobody expects the Tories to have fewer seats after the next election than the 198 they won at the 2005 general election. But they will need to gain 126 seats to secure the 324 seats needed for a workable majority. Four candidates refused to take part in the survey: one because he said he had been told not to by Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) and one because he did not want to speak to the Guardian. A briefing note was sent by CCHQ to some candidates reminding them of party policy in the areas covered by the survey. One respondent acknowledged that. Others said they had had no contact with CCHQ at all. In all, 66 candidates participated, interviewed by phone, email or face to face. Their replies are published in full online at theguardian.com/newtories.</p> <p>On tax breaks for marriage, a key Cameron policy, the candidates line up behind their leader, 84% of respondents saying the statement \"the tax system needs to be reformed to recognise and promote marriage\" was closer to their view than \"the tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status\".</p> <p>In Bolton North West Deborah Dunleavy, who is unmarried and raising children with her partner, underlined that she regarded the move to be fiscal rebalancing rather than cultural conservatism. \"It's not about giving married couples extra benefits,\" she said. \"But at the moment they are being penalised under the current government. Civil partnerships should be treated equally too.\" </p> <p>Shaun Bailey in Hammersmith said that right now \"to be married is almost a stigma\". Another PPC, Richard Graham (Gloucester), directly framed his answer in terms of being a progressive or not. </p> <p>\"I am with David Cameron on this,\" he said. \"My wife has three sisters who are divorced ... my wife and I have been happy together and we think marriage is the right thing. It doesn't sound progressive but by God it is.\" He did not explain how \u00a320 a week would have saved the marriages of his sisters-in-law.</p> <p>A majority of the candidates supported Cameron on tax breaks for married couples. But while some regarded the policy as a tax tidy-up, with an important social message, some candidates gave answers with a whiff of cultural conservativism.</p> <p>\"Would you prefer to be a single mum with a series of failed relationships with males, in preference to having a stable settled relationship with one man for the rest of your life? We seem to be championing the fact that it's all right to be accepting the second best route at the moment,\" said Philip Milton, Devon North.</p> <p>Jeremy Moulton, candidate for Southampton Test, also raised the spectre of the term \"single mothers\", a group the Conservatives have been at pains not to alienate since their past image as the \"nasty party\" was in no small part down to an apparent belief that single mothers were feckless. </p> <p>Moulton said: \"There are huge problems coming from single-parent families. Promoting marriage, which offers an extra \u00a31,000 per household, per year: a lot of people would go in for that in my constituency.\" </p> <p>But the other strain that was interesting might be a liberalising influence on Cameron when he implements this policy.</p> <p>A third of respondents took the opportunity, unprompted, to say that they would like those in any stable relationship, but not necessarily married, to also be recognised. George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, told the Guardian yesterday that a Tory government would aim to help all parents. He supported tax breaks for married couples and denied reports that he had fallen out with Cameron on the issue.</p> <p>\"I do think that parents raising children should be treated equally alongside those that are married,\" said Guto Bebb, candidate for Aberconwy. \"I don't think being married should be the only option. Clearly we have moved on since the 1950s.\" </p> <p>Ken Andrew, candidate for Carshalton and Wallington, made the point that those who had lost their spouse should not be penalised. Stuart Penketh (Ellesmere Port and Neston) said: \"It shouldn't be the government's responsibility to dictate to people how they live their lives, so long as it is legal ... I was brought up by my mother. She and my father divorced but he was always there.\"</p> <p>Another striking facet of the survey was the degree to which respondents lined up in support of green taxes. Cameron's enthusiasm for the environment is not shared universally by a party often allergic to tax increases. Sixty-six per cent of the candidates told the Guardian they supported the party on green taxes as long as Osborne stands by his commitment that they will not increase the overall tax burden. But 32% were unconvinced by the taxes, which are designed to curb pollution, and some candidates said they would hit the poor.</p> <p>There was confusion about what other tax cuts these green taxes might allow. Osborne has said that green taxes will pay for a \"family fund\" that will finance tax breaks for families. Guto Bebb called for green taxes instead of \"work tax\"; Trevor Ivory (North Norfolk) wanted to \"shift the tax burden away from jobs\". Other green ideas were raised instead of tax. Keith Girling in Bassetlaw thought that constituents who were environmentally friendly should be reimbursed. But then there were those with reservations. </p> <p>In Colne Valley, candidate Jason McCartney - in favour of the principle - admitted to the Guardian in a separate interview that at his selection meeting the issue he found most demanding was local hostility to a tax on so-called Chelsea tractors or 4x4s. \"The association were saying to me, 'Yes, they may be unnecessary for people down in the south but we want recognition that we need them up here'.\"</p> <p>Gordon Henderson, attempting to become MP for the Kent seat of Sittingbourne and Sheppey, made the local evening news recently by suggesting street rubbish could be cleared by the area's unoccupied elderly: \"I like to think of it as an environmental Grandad's Army.\" But he was opposed to the location in his area of the substation for the largest British wind farm. </p> <p>Suzy Davies, candidate for Brecon and Radnorshire, put wind farms, or what she called \"wind factories\", as the issue over which she would be prepared to defy prime minister Cameron. </p> <p>All respondents still held low tax to be a Conservative principle, but all kept to the party line that they could wait. </p> <p>\"Everybody has got their knickers in a twist about tax cuts,\" said Anna Sourby, candidate for Broxtowe. Mark Formosa, candidate for Taunton Deane, offered that \"kitting out our servicemen and women should come before any tax cuts\". Some were a little too transparently loyal - \"you couldn't get a cigarette paper between me and the party line on tax\" (Amber Rudd in Hastings and Rye), or principled: \"10 years ago I wouldn't have voted Tory myself, that is what is so progressive about this party - letting people on low incomes keep more of their earnings\" (Chris Philp in Hampstead and Kilburn). </p> <p>Flick Drummond (Portsmouth South) said he thought rightwinger John Redwood's policy review had been very good. In Birmingham Edgbaston, Birmingham city councillor Deirdre Alden said: \"We need to help hard-working families and couples without children\" and refused to go any further. Outside Alden's window was her husband's car, a silver Jaguar with the registration B17 TAX.</p> <p>If the party was once very publicly divided on the question of the European Union, this new generation is politeness itself, with a majority saying they believe the country has gained from membership.</p> <p>But should certain PPCs get to parliament, there will be moves to renegotiate our relationship with the EU, and those may be led by Jeremy Brier. On paper he's a Tory boy from central casting - one-time president of the Cambridge Union, now a 28-year-old barrister aiming to represent Luton. He is also the son of two social workers. A pet hobby of his is European law. \"When I tell my students that you can get member states voting no, for entirely different reasons - socialists in France and free marketeers in Holland, they laugh - it's madness.\" </p> <p>Most of Brier's colleagues had a two-part answer: on matters such as the environment, health and free trade, Britain had gained from being in the EU, but on the bureaucracy and fisheries policy, the EU left something to be desired. </p> <p>Mark Spencer, candidate for Sherwood, said: \"As a farmer, Europe is one of those areas where your working life and politics are hard to reconcile. As a farmer I'm protected by CAP, it's a source of our livelihood.\" Very few broached the idea of withdrawal from the EU, or as Chris Walker, candidate for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirkshire, put it, \"retreat ... the million-dollar question\". </p> <p>The language used by the candidates is occasionally antiquated: public finances are a \"shambles\"; we should \"salute\" civil partnerships, but on policy there has been movement. Their leadership calls it \"progressive goals through Conservative means\" but this survey of the likely next group of Tory MPs shows it may be more like a conjoining of cultural conservatism on private life with strong backing for the leadership on tax, with the hope that cuts will be targeted at the poor.</p> <p>You wouldn't get George Osborne driving a Jaguar with a car registration plate ending in TAX, you wouldn't get policy chief Oliver Letwin with a poster about casual sex above his desk and you wouldn't get shadow work and pensions secretary Chris Grayling suggesting pensioners clean the streets. But with the new intake of MPs the signs are that they'll mix things up a bit.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/newtories\">Read all the candidates' answers</a></p>",
  "<p>Going on a school trip can be a life-changing event, bringing memories that stay forever. For many children it might be the first time they have slept away from home overnight. Even just a day trip to a museum can sew the seeds of a life-long love affair with culture. </p> <p>For headteacher Brian Thomas, accompanying his brother-in-law on a school trip to Dorset was the catalyst which triggered a 34-year career in teaching. He remembers: \"I was a senior manager for Godfrey Davies and it was 1969. The children were living out and had to make their own shelter. I realised what children gained from the experience, from the residential aspect and the environmental studies - it was what made me want to be a teacher.\"</p> <p>Thomas' enthusiasm for school trips has stayed with him ever since. His 418-pupil Milton Mount primary school in Crawley, West Sussex was one of the first, 18 months ago, to sign up to the government's Learning Outside the Classroom manifesto which acknowledges that children's education can be enriched the other side of the school gates. So far around 1,000 schools and education organisations have pledged their support. The government's next step comes in October when it launches a \"quality badge\" or kite-mark system for popular UK school trip destinations in a bid to take some of the bureaucracy out of the organisation, making it easier for schools while, at the same time, reassuring parents that the venues have an educational value and have met safety guidelines.</p> <p><strong>Safety issues</strong></p> <p>Children's safety underpins any school trip, be it a visit to the local museum or a trek through the South American rainforest. When things go wrong the tragedies dominate news headlines, making every parent think \"what if\" and teachers re-check their risk assessment. While any accidental death on a school trip will always be one too many, the official statistics are reassuring, showing that a child is more likely to die following an accident at home or on the road in the UK than they are on a school trip. </p> <p>According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), in the last 22 years 60 children and 10 adults from the UK have died on a school trip at home or abroad, the most common causes being drowning or a road accident. This compares with the 121 children last year in Great Britain, who died following a road accident and 93, the previous year, who suffered a fatal accident at home.</p> <p>Peter Cornall, head of leisure safety at RoSPA, says: \"If you consider there are around 7m school trips every year we are talking about a very small number that go wrong. What a school trip can do is give children an opportunity to start thinking about dangers and risk assessment. It gives them the opportunity to trust adults other than their parents, in the real world.\" </p> <p>Margaret Morrissey from the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations recognises parents' concerns about safety but says the benefits far outweigh the risks: \"The value of these trips is tremendous. It builds children's confidence and does something parents can't do which is to take them away from their parents and teach them to be more independent.\" </p> <p>Personal memories from school trips can stay forever. Brian Thomas, who retired from teaching at the end of the summer term, recalls meeting a former pupil, now in her 40s, at a recent reunion party: \"She told me that the residential visits we went on 26 years ago had had an impact on her for the rest of her life.\" </p> <p>Marcus Bailie is head of inspections at the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority - the organisation which endorses the way that centres are managed - set up in the wake of the Lyme Regis canoeing disaster in 1993 which claimed the lives of four teenage pupils. He attributes a two-week school out-door activities trip to France after A-levels as an event which changed his life, developing an interest in kayaking which has stayed with him ever since.</p> <p>Tina Corri, head of education at English Heritage, is responsible for the learning experiences on offer at its 415 sites. They range from castles and stately homes to stone circles and Stonehenge, which are visited by more than 400,000 children and adults on educational trips each year. She says: \"Just being in a different learning environment, out in the fresh air, standing on a castle wall - learning about the real things in the place, in their true context - can be a real experience. I remember when I was 12 or 13 going on a school trip to the National Gallery, it was a really formative time. I wanted to be that person taking the session - that was my moment.\"</p> <p><strong>AALA</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.aala.org.uk\">aala.org.uk</a> <br><strong>English heritage</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk\">english-heritage.org.uk </a><br><strong>ROSPA</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.rospa.org.uk\">www.rospa.org.uk</a> <br><strong>Teachernet</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/learningoutsidetheclassroom\">teachernet.gov.uk/learning outsidetheclassroom</a></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"Yes, very much so, and the party under David Cameron is indeed very progressive, coming up with radical solutions, not just relying on solutions that have been tried and have failed. We are now the party that is looking to improve the lives of people who have been left behind, and that is truly progressive. </p> <p>\"It is an evolution from what has passed before. Margaret Thatcher moved us forward in addressing economic issues, and now it is a different sort of challenge. What we are addressing now is how we stop a small but growing number of people being left behind in education, being left in poverty and giving those people access to the right opportunities.</p> <p>\"[Have the Tories changed?] It's a question of generation. It's a long time since we were last in government. I have stood in two previous elections, but I am pretty rare. There is a new sense about the party; it is attracting people who are looking to the future and are not just there to fight old battles.\" </p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"No, it is right that we put the stability of the economy first. We are a low-tax party and over time we should be moving towards letting people keep and spend more of their own money.\" </p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"At this stage it is impossible to say because we have no idea. There is as yet no date for an election, that election has not been won and we do not know the state of the public finances. At this stage it is far too early to be talking about it. I think the only thing we can be sure of is in the last 10 years it has become clear that simply throwing money at social problems does not work.\" </p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"We have also said that green taxes should be part of a balancing of taxes, there to encourage people to move in the right direction and that can only be a good thing. </p> <p>\"But I think we have to be careful because people have become quite cynical and wary of things being dressed up as green taxes that are in reality just revenue generators. We have to restore a bit of faith. When we call a green tax a green tax people have to be sure that we are addressing the problem and that it is not just a stealth tax.\" </p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"I really can't say, as for the moment we just do not know what the state of the public finances will be.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"We have definitely gained by being part of the EU. But it is not perfect and there are lots of aspects that need to be improved, not least budgetary controls. It is very important that we remain part of that trading block and work together on things like the environment that national states cannot act on alone.</p> <p>\"I find the idea of us leaving Europe very difficult to envisage. But I think that what we have seen is that the leaders in Europe are making a big mistake in pushing their citizens towards ever-greater integration before they are ready for it.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"I support David Cameron on this but I think he has removed the moralising tone that surrounded this issue perhaps 20 years ago.</p> <p>\"This identifies that marriage is beneficial to children and if something is working it makes sense to recognise it.

  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>Progressive. </p> <p>\"There's a perception of Conservatives that says we stand for maintaining the status quo and shying away from the future. But we are building on and valuing the past. If progressive politics means, as you say, looking at bettering equal opportunity, we need to change what the current government has done. Their approach to social deprivation has been to use a national scheme and therefore ticking that box. </p> <p>\"Its important to have diversity in this current crop of prospectives [candidates] and people from different experiences and backgrounds. I can still connect with teenagers and school-goers and it's important to open up communication with all parts of the community, to establish a rapport. </p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"It's right he shouldn't make promises that we may not be able to keep. He shouldn't be making tax commitments, especially as we don't know whether there will be an election in autumn or in 2010. If he did, between now and then the economic position could worsen.\"<br> </p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>See answer to Q2.</p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"I believe that taxes should reflect the cost of goods and services. What I don't like is 'bitty' clampdowns on, for example, one local council's taxation of SUV vehicles \u2013 this is not a good rationale. There needs to be a more consistent and coherent set of policies, which is coexistent with Euro- and global policies.\"<br> <br></p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%.

Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"As a Conservative, I guess I believe in a smaller state. We've certainly gained from Europe's freer trade \u2013 that said, I don't think our presence in Europe should be social and political. </p> <p>\"I campaigned against the Lisbon treaty \u2013 if it gets through, it will be the end of the nation-state. I would advocate a referendum on that treaty.\" </p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status</h2> <p>\"This is definitely something we have to address. At the moment, it is more worthwhile, financially, to live apart, which is totally illogical, with two people picking up two sets of benefits. I'm totally in support of marriage, being married myself. Is it moralising? There's an interesting role to play in terms of providing moral issues \u2013 I think we should be braver in getting that message across.\"<br> <br></p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced?

  "<p>So many of us are having a hard time of it. Bush is a lame duck. Gordon's just lame. Throw into the mix the spectre of world recession, and our failure to focus on the plight of Andrew Motion, our poet laureate, becomes a little more understandable. He steps down from the post in the spring, and it falls to us to correct this oversight. Let us do so now. \"The job has been incredibly difficult and entirely thankless,\" he told an audience at the Ealing Arts Festival. \"The job has been very, very damaging to my writing; in fact I dried up completely about five years ago and can't write anything except to commission. I thought the poetry had all gone, but I feel some of it is still there and may yet return.\" We blame the Queen for at least part of it. So does he. \"The Queen never gives me an opinion on my work for her,\" he said huffily. \"The last thing I did was for her diamond wedding anniversary. I came up with a poem and had to go along to Westminster Abbey. It was read beautifully by Dame Judi Dench. Afterwards the Queen stopped me and said, 'Thank you.' But I have no idea if she really liked it. I just wrote what I could for them, did what I had to do, and I won't be including any of that work in my future collections. Writing for the royals was a hiding to nothing.\" He said he \"tried to wake it up, make it more about life than it ever was before\", but even this proved taxing. You did your best. Welcome back to the real world. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>And that could be Brighton, where the unions are once more threatening the government. The skies are dark, the mood also. Yesterday delegates voted on the concept of staging more strikes to protest at Gordon's curbs on pay - all save for Unite, whose officials couldn't work out which way to vote, and so didn't. The motion was lost by 700,000 votes. Unite can muster 1.7 million. \"You don't know what you're doing,\" muttered the delegates around them, but that's also what they shout at Gordon. Can't we all just get along?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>\"She was the Siouxsie Sioux of politics. And just as the punk goddess Siouxsie performed on stage with naked breasts protruding from her bondage outfits and swastikas adorning her arms, so Thatcher revealed things that were normally kept under wraps\" - AN Wilson from his new book, Our Times: The Age of Elizabeth ll, as serialised in yesterday's Daily Mail. The book will sell at \u00a322.50. It's another \u00a33 for the smelling salts.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Though many scoff still at the failure of the security services to notice the presence of such KGB luminaries as Anthony Blunt and Kim Philby in their midst, there is proof in the National Archives that some operatives kept a very close eye indeed on selected individuals during the second world war, with no concession, even to members of the aristocracy. Here is a special agent - codename Brit - on the 2nd Viscount Tredegar, an artist and poet who had seen service in the Guards: \"He is reputed to be worth \u00a32m from coal. A Roman Catholic, he was chamberlain of the sword and cape to Popes Benedict XV and Pius XI. Tredegar, a notorious homosexual, is famed throughout Europe (Capri etc) and the east (Bali etc) as a pervert of the lowest order, a drug addict and a drunkard. It is known that his parties rival those of ancient Rome in their incredible perverted grandeur. The Rt Hon the Viscountess Tredegar, although no match for her 'husband', is a chip off the same block.\" Of course, none of this made him a bad person, or indeed called into question his secret work at the War Office, where he was involved in monitoring the flights of carrier pigeons lest they were used to carry secrets to the enemy. It merely shows that he was checked out, which is more than can be said of Blunt and Philby. Whatever Tredegar's faults, he wasn't boring.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>And finally time for thought for the day - and in the aftermath of that cross-party report calling for new curbs on migrants, a word from Mike Turbine-Hamilton. \"If we exported Nicholas Soames, we'd have plenty of room for immigrants,\" he says. Simple, yet humane, Mike. Now, any thoughts on Frank Field?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Thursday September 18 2008.

  "<p>Russia last night agreed to pull all of its forces out of Georgia within a month, after an agreement in Moscow between France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev. </p> <p>Describing yesterday's deal as \"momentous\", Sarkozy said Moscow had agreed to scrap its checkpoints inside Georgia in a week and had promised to remove all forces from areas adjacent to the breakaway enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia within a month. </p> <p>The agreement also envisaged the deployment of a 200-strong force of EU observers to Georgia by October 1, Sarkozy said. Additionally, international talks would take place on October 15 in Geneva on the future of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which Moscow recognised as independent late last month. </p> <p>Sarkozy, the current EU president, led today's negotiations together with the European Commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, and the EU's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana. The deal appears to mark a major achievement for Sarkozy. He had been widely criticised after Moscow's failure to implement his previous August 12 ceasefire agreement, which called for Russia to pull its troops out. </p> <p>\"All has not been resolved,\" Sarkozy said. \"We are aware of that. But what has been resolved has been considerable.\" He hailed the deal and added that both the EU and Russia had avoided \"a cold war that we don't need.\" In a press conference yesterday afternoon, after four hours of talks, Medvedev made clear that Russia's withdrawal of forces depended on Georgia signing a \"non-aggression pact\" with South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The pullout does not include Abkhazia and South Ossetia where, Medvedev said, Russia would continue to provide what he termed \"military assistance\". </p> <p>Sarkozy flew to Tbilisi last night to hold talks with Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, who yesterday wrote a letter accepting a non-aggression pact. </p> <p>However, in a sign of continuing tension between Russia and the US, the Bush administration said it was cancelling a much-heralded civilian nuclear cooperation deal with Russia, which Bush had sent to Congress for approval in May, after two years of tough negotiations. The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said in a statement yesterday: \"We make this decision with regret. Unfortunately, given the current environment, the time is not right for this agreement.\"</p> <p>Earlier, in Moscow, Medvedev had bitterly criticised the US, which, he said, had encouraged Georgia's \"aggression\" against South Ossetia and its attack on August 8. The US was also \"actively\" re-arming Georgia, he claimed, and made it clear that Russia would no longer accept a \"unipolar model\" of world affairs in which the US decided \"the rules of the game\". </p> <p>Asked whether the Kremlin planned to invade any more of its neighbours, Medvedev looked irritated. Referring to Georgia, he said: 'This is an individual situation. Everything else is just plots ... Some people are trying to look at Russia like the Soviet Union. Russia is different. But Russia needs to be taken into account.\"</p> <p>Assuming Russia fully withdraws its forces, talks could resume in October on an EU-Russia cooperation deal, Sarkozy said. EU countries suspended the talks last week in protest at Russia's actions in Georgia.</p> <p>According to Russia's Kommersant newspaper, Moscow plans to establish diplomatic relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia today.</p>",
  "<p>Oliver Harrison has described his successor as Amir Khan's trainer, Jorge Rubio, as \"a Cuban amateur\" and said the boxer should consider linking up with Naseem Hamed's former trainer Brendan Ingle if he is to have any chance of rebuilding his career after his 54sec knockout against the Colombian Breidis Prescott.</p> <p>Harrison, 47, was sacked as Khan's trainer after he had guided the 2004 Olympic silver medallist through his first 17 wins as a professional. The promoter Frank Warren's matchmaker, Dean Powell, then stood in to prepare Khan for his victory over Michael Gomez before Rubio, a former trainer of the Cuban national squad, was hired for the Prescott fight.</p> <p>\"I can't believe how Amir fought,\" said Harrison. \"It was absolutely the wrong way to fight somebody who can bang. I can't believe they learned him to keep his hands up and just stand in front of a fighter like that. He tries to be macho but that's not Amir. He naturally has his hands low and slips and slides like Tommy Hearns. The Amir I know would have his guard in front of his face and slip and slide to avoid the punches. But the Cuban guy had him with his hands up just walking forward. Madness. Any half-decent fighter could have hit him.\"</p> <p>Harrison was angered by quotes attributed to the Khan camp after he had been dismissed saying it had always been the plan to look for an overseas trainer. Last week Khan went further, saying Harrison had never properly shown him what he was doing wrong. But Harrison blames the interference of Khan's entourage, principally his father, Shah, and his business manager, Asif Vali, for creating an impossible working environment.</p> <p>\"All I ever wanted was Amir to myself,\" he said. \"But they wanted him to do interviews, to open clubs. Now he's even been saying, 'I like the cameras, I want the cameras,' and slagging me off like I was an old girlfriend. Now they go and get a Cuban amateur trainer.</p> <p>\"Team Khan are amateurs. I was the only pro there and I was fighting an uphill battle. So when I saw him knocked out I was happy but sad. Happy because of what they have said about me but sad because I could have taken him to the top.</p> <p>\"If they had gone out and hired Floyd Mayweather or Buddy McGirt I might have felt a little better. But I think they brought in the cheapest person. And what does he do? He has Amir holding his hand up high like a German. Amir is a slick boxer, he could have boxed that guy's head off. Against a puncher, to fight like that ... I don't think so.\"</p> <p>Although Khan intends to stand by Rubio and use him for his next contest, Harrison believes the Cuban should be dismissed and has urged Khan to consider bringing in Ingle and his son Dominic, who have been the brains behind outstanding Sheffield-based fighters including Hamed, the former world featherweight champion.</p> <p>Rubio has returned to Miami and was unavailable for comment last night. But Vali insisted there were no regrets about the split with Harrison, saying: \"Amir still wants Rubio to be his coach. Jorge is very upset and disappointed what happened because Amir did not have a chance to show everybody what he has learned. He wanted to prove something as a coach and it didn't happen, so naturally he is down.</p> <p>\"A lot of things were wrong and we will learn from it. Amir is going back to the drawing board. He's still a 21-year-old boy. Perhaps we didn't do our homework but he has to forget talking about the world title. It is about rebuilding now.\"</p>",
  "<p>America is a land that feels familiar, but often turns out to be very foreign: so much of what happens there is beyond European imagining. The spectacular rescue on Sunday of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is a case in point. These two strange, gargantuan financial bodies could not have been born in Britain and they could not have been saved in Britain. They carried in their DNA both the old idealism of FDR's New Deal (established in 1938, Fannie Mae was a government agency for its first 30 years) and a much more modern and toxic capacity to bring the world financial system to its knees. </p> <p>Without the US government's decision to take control - nationalisation in all but name - and to inject up to $100bn into each, the downturn could have slumped into depression. This rescue had to happen. But an American fix will not solve Britain's problems, and nor does it provide any longer-term solutions to the obvious and painful failings of capitalism. At great cost, American taxpayers have defused a bomb whose imminent detonation might have caused intercontinental financial ruin. But all that has been gained is time. The world still needs to work out what should happen next.</p> <p>Small, short-term rallies on stock markets yesterday (limited in London by a computer breakdown that suspended trading) cannot hide the fact that the last year has seen market failure on an extraordinary scale. Nor will the latest rescue prevent this failure continuing. Other American financial institutions with famous names are threatened, so big that they too would have to be rescued. Each Megabank that wobbles threatens to cause a mega-crash. But at least, for all its claim to love capitalism red in tooth and claw, America has a tradition of muscular financial interventionism on the part of the federal government, even if some of it has been unwound over the past decade. The rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is simply much the biggest example. Britain has no such tradition, and this government has shown itself strangely reluctant to begin one. The Bank of England did not make vigorous use of the special liquidity scheme introduced at the start of the year; indeed it will be closed next month. </p> <p>Gordon Brown's lame claim yesterday that Britain can \"do well indeed ... [out] of a new world of new change\" is evidence of a prime minister who still chooses to think that economic woes have been imported and so, presumably, must be solved abroad. It would be more use if he, or someone else in government, began to address the reality of Britain's position. Arguably, it is worse than America's. The housing bubble was bigger, and the decline in prices is less well advanced. The British economy shows no sign of the recovery predicted for America - and which, if it happens, might leave taxpayers in pocket over time with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Employment figures here are still robust, but if they falter, and house prices fall, pressure on mortgage lenders will grow. That is what did for the two US giants - neither directly exposed to sub-prime. Their rescue may help make conditions more comfortable in America. In Britain, the pain is still to come. </p> <p>So many questions have been raised by the credit crunch that answering them all will take decades. The most obvious lesson is that the state still has a central role in protecting the vulnerable from risk. The biggest banks can only be bailed out by government. But there is no reason why public protection should enhance private profit: as true of Northern Rock here as it is of the striking $23m payoff for the bosses of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Corporate excess needs to be regulated in all its forms - risk and reward - and that is another job for the state. In the meantime, though, the global financial system has been caught staggering, close to collapse. Propping it up is the right thing to do, if only to save citizens from the consequences of a failure that is not of their making, and to provide space for recovery and reform.</p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive?</h2> <p>\"I think that one of the great problems that political parties face is that they speak in a language that is largely alien to most normal people. Politicians are often guilty of living in this political bubble, whereas the rest of the world simply wants the country run just a little bit better. The public don't expect miracles or a magic pill that will sort out all their problems they just want to see some honesty and integrity. So I think that a massive intellectual exercise in progressiveness is a little beyond them, and beyond me frankly. </p> <p>\"On the other hand, I think it is absolutely right that the Conservatives offer a credible alternative and I think David Cameron has been remarkably effective at the so-called detoxification of the Tory party. Being progressive is not about abandoning your principles but making those principles more contemporary. Of course the Tory party needed to shed some of the aspects that have made it unelectable. We have to provide a sensible, new and viable alternative. If that involves a certain amount of branding, then so be it. If that is progressive then great, but that doesn't mean a complete departure from what the party stands for.\" </p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"I think Cameron should keep being straight, and he is. There are those who believe that the Conservative party stands for tax cuts full stop. But in the current economic situation it would be irresponsible. The Conservative party will reduce tax when the country can afford to reduce tax, but saying we will do so now is tantamount to dishonesty.'</p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"There is always a capacity to make savings. There is a view that public services are too big or too expensive, but for me it's more a question of priorities. Pointing out that the NHS spends more on managers than doctors sounds like a soundbite, but is unfortunately much closer to the truth than it should be. We have to get rid of layers of bureaucracy and not damage institutions like the NHS, but improve them.\"</p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"I am very comfortable with the idea of green taxes. In a sense I think it's a pity that it has become a party political issue, it is much bigger than that and we really have to be looking at how to address climate change on a global scale. But what David Cameron and the Conservatives have done is push it right up the agenda. </p> <p>\"But it has to be carefully thought through so that any taxes are tackling big industry rather than the lowest earners.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"I believe in a lower tax burden as a general principle but I also believe in value for money. But at the moment it is too simplistic to be talking about how much the tax burden should be reduced by, there are so many factors and unknowns to consider.\" </p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"There are arguments that suggest we are worse off than if we had taken an alternative route, but on balance I think the positives outweigh the negatives. I'm not a believer in going backwards. We have to be part of the EU, not run by the EU - it's been said before, but I think it's quite concise. If we are going to be critical of the current government it is that they have not stood up to the worst abuses, we have not had a real debate about the encroachment of power, there has not even been any gentle resistance.<br> <br>\"What we need to do is get rid of some of the bureaucratic crap but that is a long way from saying that we should leave.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"Lots of people at the moment are in happy relationships and would be happy to get married but it is economically disadvantageous to do so. That is just crazy. </p> <p>\"David Cameron, is looking at addressing some problems of society not be only tackling the outcomes but the causes. This means giving more support to marriage and parents.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"I go with the science on this one and think there should be a reduction in the limit to 18 weeks. I am not a pro-lifer but as the science improves I would say it is sensible to err on the side of caution.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Alexandra Topping</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive?</h2> <p>\"I think that to a large extent the Conservative party has always been the progressive party back to Benjamin Disraeli who legalised trade unions and empowered local government. We are the progressive party now \u2014 you only have to look at 10 years of Labour to see that the inequality gap is growing. There are almost 4 million pupils who have left school without four good GCSEs including Maths and English. When you look at figures like that you wouldn't believe we have had 11 years of a Labour government. We are progressive in that we are the party of opportunity of social mobility and that increases social esteem. </p> <p>\"I work as a barrister in criminal law and the number of young people I see with absolutely zero self esteem, involved in the criminal justice system, drug addicts. David Cameron said Margaret Thatcher had to deal with a broken economy he has to deal with a broken society \u2013 I don't want to quibble with Boris Johnson or David but I am sure that it is right that there are some things that are broken in this society. Inequalities are the widest they have ever been and getting wider nobody would have believed that listening to New Labour in 1997. The poorest fifth of the population are paying the highest proportion of tax of any group.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"We have already said we would abolish stamp duty for first time buyers and raise the inheritance tax threshold because it is unfair. We believe in lower taxes, doing this is economically more efficient but we can't make any uncosted promises at the moment.\"</p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or<br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"We really can't say what will happen in two years' time but we know that we can make savings from bureaucracy. A doctor told me there is one manager for every hospital bed. We will of course save billions by scrapping ID cards.\"</p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"We have said that we would increase the percentage of taxation raised through green taxes that means redirected taxation away from certain things like jobs and entrepreneurialism and into carbon emissions. George Osborne has said revenue raised through green taxes would be added to an independently monitored family fund aimed at tax cuts for families.\" </p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"You couldn't possibly expect anyone to make any predictions six years hence; even those far more enlightened than me are not doing that. We haven't seen the books yet.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"On balance we have gained and we should stay in so long as it is good for us and where it isn't we should start saying so. It's been extremely beneficial in terms of things like a say in global warming and global health but as Barack Obama said last night (August 28) you make progress from the bottom up not the top down and Europe is too full of messages and rules from the top.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"I am an A. The tax and benefit system should encourage families to stay together. I have been in criminal law for 15 years and all the time this issue rears its head. Why should the system subsidise single parents or couples to live apart when all the evidence shows families and children are better when couples are together.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"I believe the limit should be lowered perhaps to 22 weeks because medical evidence shows that new advances mean that babies can be kept alive much earlier.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Mark Gould</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"Definitely, and the party is more so than ever. The Conservatives have got to grips with what is really troubling families in Britain at the moment. What I am really excited about is that the Conservatives are taking the time to get to the heart of the problems in this country. Lots of younger people are looking at the Conservatives with fresh eyes, who perhaps have not considered voting for us before. It's not just a perception, however. There is a real sea change in the party when it comes to focusing on social issues.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"The bottom line is that we believe in lower taxes but we have made it quite clear that we are not going to make a solid commitment to cut taxes because we simply don't know what the books will look like. Our commitment is to getting the economy stable and making sure that the state has a valuable role rather than simply a large role. </p> <p>\"Frankly, we have got to be careful with [the subject of taxes]. In an ideal world we would want to lower taxes but, at the moment, with the economy in such a state, it would be wrong to give blanket commitments about cutting income tax.\" </p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"I think we are going to have to see how we go. It seems very sensible to me to introduce green taxes, and instead of penalising families, moving that to carbon emissions.</p> <p>\"There is no suggestion of cutting public spending, we have to balance the books and stabilise the country first. I stand by the principle of lower taxes. <br>I think we need to look more broadly at public services which don't need to be provided exclusively by the state. It needn't be a question of cutting public services but rather giving a better choice of providers.\" </p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"As a starting point, the Conservatives have really taken the initiative on the environment. People are committed to doing what they can. What we need to be doing is: instead of taxing families, let's look at carbon emissions. It's not going to be easy, but we are committed to looking at it.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"I think the aspiration, subject to economic conditions, is that we will have lower taxes but at the moment it is impossible to say by how much. There are some good radical ideas coming from the Conservatives at the moment and we have to focus on that.\" </p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"I think there are pros and cons. Without a doubt there are great benefits to Britain from the free movement of people and goods \u2013 all of that is really positive. But it is not ideal; I am concerned about the consistent attempts to take power away from national governments towards the EU. It is a constant battle and that is not going to go away. </p> <p>\"I certainly think no further powers should be given to the EU, certainly not without a referendum.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"It is not unusual to recognise marriage in the tax system. At the moment you have a situation where parents are better off if they do not live together. </p> <p>\"It's a difficult subject, but David Cameron has taken a line on it that we should stand by marriage, and I agree that is important. Marriage shows a level of commitment that people give each other and that should be recognised.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"In my view it should be lowered, but not by much. I am pro-choice and I support a woman's right to abortion, but if we are seeing babies survive at 24 weeks then we need to look again. I would say the limit should be between 20-22 weeks.\" </p> <p><strong>Interview by Alexandra Topping</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>Progressive. </p> <p>\"Absolutely. I remember at school we had a debate as to whether Margaret Thatcher was the least Conservative MP ever. I think it's the same with David Cameron. Obviously, the Conservative ideal is constant, but it's how we apply that to the modern age that's key. We're very keen to end the decline of social mobility, without regimenting people.\" </p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"We have to spend what we have in the most effective way. It's a delicate balance and goodness knows what public finances are going to be like in 18 months' time. Fiscal stability comes first. There are huge underfunded liabilities, like the PFI project, which don't appear on the balance sheet.\" </p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"We've got to look at existing public spending. We're not going to proceed with the ID card scheme, so that will free up billions that could be used elsewhere. But the point is: even if you don't change tax burdens, you can change tax reforms. I'm interested in seeing a lower corporate tax.\"</p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"We've got to look at everything individually. As a general rule, we need a system to encourage better attitudes towards the environment. I'm a details man, and so, for example, I think that with airport taxes, it's not a good idea to jack up industry ticket levies. That way, we won't have things like ghost flights needed to meet quotas.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"In the long term, it needs to be lower than where it is now. We need to look at the international economy, because Britain is becoming less competitive.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"We have gained from being members. As a democrat, I think that the EU has lost its way, becoming an elite club who say: 'We know what's best for you and how to spend your money.' The EU needs a fundamental rethink, but it's already changing. We have a new dynamic with the central countries \u2013 like the Czech Rep, who don't subscribe to the Franco-German model of Europe. But I hope and believe that a more flexible Europe is achievable. I'm also an advocate of Turkey joining the EU.\" </p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"At the moment, there is a disincentive to marry and there are a lot of kids growing up without a male role model. But there's no silver bullet to counter these problems. I'd suggest, as one of the tax reforms, we could have transferable tax allowances \u2013 which, without wanting to be moralistic \u2013 I'd be happy to extend to same-sex marriages. Furthermore, if one partner has to look after children while the other parent is at work, their allowance can be transferred to the working partner.\"<br> <br></p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"Certainly \u2013 to 22 weeks. It's now clear that life can be sustained below 24 weeks. I don't take an extremist view and usually have a pro-life perspective, but medical development has moved on.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Johnny McDevitt</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"I think the party is progressive and I count myself among a new breed of Conservative candidates. I work in a state school, I'm young \u2013 perhaps not what you wouldn't typically expect.</p> <p>\"The problem with the party is that it is still trying to apply 80s solutions to modern-day problems, and that doesn't work. But I think there is a new group of Conservatives, and I think I am among them, that are coming up with new solutions, and things are changing. In the first year after [David] Cameron was elected as leader I think it was about changing the mood music, the colours, the language. It was very important to convince people that we understood what the issues are today. </p> <p>\"I think now we are seeing that permeate into policy, we are laying the foundations and building on them. There are one or two things where I would prefer if we were going further. I'd like us to be more explicit on education and the environment for example. We are spending a lot of time of the economy, and understandably so, but I want to see us be just as radical in social policy. I can understand why he might want to keep things under wraps though, because every time we come up with a cracker the Labour party nicks it. Some of those policies will be controversial, but we have to go out there and fight for them. Green taxes, for example, are a sore point for a lot of people, but we have to put the ideas out there, we have to debate and sort out what we think before there is an election.</p> <p>\"I also think we need to keep in mind, for every decision that we take, what does this approach mean for the bottom 25% of the electorate? I think if we are going to have tax cuts they need to be aimed at the lowest paid workers.\" </p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"I think we need to be careful to remember what the Labour party does to us when we announce tax cuts and how they manipulate that. What we need is grassroots reform, not simply to hurl money at social problems. We believe in lower taxation, but the current economic situation is very poor so we are going to sort that out, protect public services. If there is any money left then we push for tax cuts.</p> <p>\"I think the party is going to have to walk a tightrope if elected, but I think we do need to be clear about a specific order of tax cuts that we will offer if possible in order to have more credibility.\" </p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"What will happen is that the growth in government spending will be less than the growth in the economy, but at the moment that growth in the economy is a big if at the moment. For the first few years I think a Conservative government would be very strapped for cash; our job is to turn the economy round so that we can afford tax cuts. At this stage the last thing that people need is more tax increases; families in my constituency are literally suffering. They are telling me that they are having to cut down on food at the moment so they can buy school uniforms, and that is atrocious. </p> <p>\"I don't think people now equate tax cuts with cuts in public services; five years ago if you talked about tax cuts people thought it meant that schools would be closing. But people no longer believe that pouring money into public services is going to get the right results; it is about what we do with that money. </p> <p>\"We have to convince the British people that we can get the same or better results for less money. I think they want to be convinced; tax cuts are back in fashion.\" </p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"I fundamentally believe that it is right to influence people's choices through the tax system and green taxes are a part of that. We need to see a lot more encouragement. I think this would see an initial rise in tax revenue while people change their behaviour and with that money we can cut taxes on good things, like families, so overall people are not paying any more. </p> <p>\"My only concern is if we are successful in changing people's attitudes then the amount of tax we raise from that will fall. How we bridge that gap we are not quite sure yet, but by the time it happens we will have the economy in a better shape and the growth will fill the gap. </p> <p>\"I also think with green taxes, like everything we do, we have to really consider how they will impact the lowest paid in society.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"In an ideal world we would want it to be substantially lower, but being realistic with the current situation I would just say it needs to be lower. We need to protect public services and kick-start the economy \u2013 that is our main concern. </p> <p>\"If we are reelected in 2014 then I would want it to be substantially lower than that.\" </p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"I'm not sure it is as simple as that. Some things have been very, very good, such as the work done on the environment and legislation around clean beaches etc. All that is very positive. But the areas in which we have suffered are in things like agriculture and fisheries. The EU is mired in corruption and suffers from a large democratic deficit; it needs changing and it needs sorting out. </p> <p>\"But you can't say, 'In that case, let's leave.' If it is not working then let's put it right. For years we have ground on about Europe but I think we have realised that people are more concerned about their standard of living. While we were just banging on about Europe we looked like we didn't care about their priorities. I think it will only play a small role in the next general election. I think people now know our views, they know we are Eurosceptic. I'm not sure what else we need.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"I think it is the commitment that marriage represents. I think we need to keep a broad definition of marriage. Gay parents, for example, should be rewarded for making a commitment to each other by having a civil partnership \u2013 I don't want it to be a narrow definition. </p> <p>\"It is more likely that parents will stay together if married and I think that if that creates more stability than that relationship should be encouraged.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"I think it should be reduced. I would drastically reduce the number of weeks to between 12-16. Of course, there has to be some room for exceptions, but I think a foetus is a human at 12 weeks, just waiting to be born. For a child at 24 weeks to be terminated is heartbreaking. I think we need to give the unborn child more respect.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Alexandra Topping</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive?</h2> <p>\"Progressives tend to be associated with democracy, reining in the political influence of big business, social justice, environmentalism. I'd like to see more of all these things, and in that sense am a progressive. But essentially I am a conservative who believes in decentralisation, the human scale, light government and trust. I believe a move towards direct democracy would bridge the gap between people and politics, and would result in a much more receptive decision-making process. \"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"Yes. There's a mantra that cutting tax means cutting services. I think people are less inclined to believe that after 10 years of Labour. Without knowing what the state of our finances will be at the time of the next election, it's impossible to make detailed promises. But by cutting government waste, and dramatically, we could be sure of enormous savings.\"</p> <h2>3 Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes?</h2> <p>\"There is a startling lack of delivery on government promises, not because of political dishonesty, but because the machinery of government itself is broken. There are too many people doing the same thing, and too little accountability. Hundreds of quangos occupy the same policy spaces, and the effect is a kind of paralysis. Good ideas are important for a government-in-waiting, but without brave structural reform, they will come to nothing. By streamlining government, making it work, I believe we'd see better results and huge savings for the taxpayer. That is the first priority.\"<br> <br></p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"Yes, but green taxes need to be totally transparent and honest, and they should never be retrospective. There's no point introducing punishments for choices already made. And where green taxes are raised, for example on the dirtiest new cars, the proceeds need to be used to reduce the cost of the cleanest cars. Green taxes must never become an excuse to raise revenue for the Treasury.\" </p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"I would hope the tax system would be simpler, and that the share of GDP tax would decline, but that very much depends on the state of the country's finances after 10 years of Labour.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"The EU provides a useful mechanism for working together on issues of common importance, not least the environment. But the organisation is structurally flawed and needs dramatic reform without which it's hard to see it either contributing usefully, or even surviving. The EU is far too bureaucratic, too grasping, and too wasteful. But the biggest problem with the EU is its lack of accountability. When the distance between people and power is too great, the former have little if any control over the latter. In the case of the EU, decision-makers are almost entirely insulated from any real democratic pressure, and that's always profoundly unhealthy. I would favour a lighter, more decentralised EU that learns the difference between national and genuinely international issues.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view?<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"It's wrong that the current benefits system gives couples with children more money if they live apart. That's perverse, and needs to be changed. But it's often single parents who need most support, and they mustn't be left stranded.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"20 weeks is more than enough time for people to make a decision in favour of abortion. However, if after that time, serious medical problems are detected, that option should remain open throughout.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Alexandra Topping</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>Progressive.</p> <p>\"We're moving forward. I agree with all that [David] Cameron's saying. I've been in politics for 15 years now and this is the first time I've been so fully in support of my party. We're bringing good Conservative ideals forward. We've recognised that the biggest problem within society is a social problem. We've had the benefit of three years to look at where policies have gone wrong. We've done a lot of research and had time to contemplate about how to move forward. I'm involved in the social workers commission and that has been well received.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"We couldn't possibly say until we've seen what's in the coffers. The state of the economy is currently unpredictable, so there may be more unemployment, people made redundant, so it's hard to say if and where cuts can be made. But the ideal situation is for low taxation.\"</p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"We need to cut the extra management and bureaucracy of Labour's time. But, yeah, cutting spending is likely \u2013 I think John Redwood's review was very helpful.\" </p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"We need to be very careful on this subject, because green taxes are affecting everyday people.

Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"We've gained a lot from Europe, especially if you look at the world today. It's provided great sources of trade. Britain on its own, without Europe, would be too small. In terms of the politics though, I'm not in favour of the federated state system. The public should have their say, absolutely, but it's whether they fully understand the issues that's a concern. We need to think about that.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"We should equally encourage single-parent families, but I also strongly believe that, at the moment, there is a horrendous attitude towards children. So many children don't get to see their parents and this government has forgotten that parenting is the most important profession. There are a lot of problems in society and we really need to promote marriage, which evidence has shown leads to greater stability in a child's life.\"<br> <br></p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced?

  "<p>A frenetic day on global financial markets saw stocks rally but shares in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae plunge, as investors digested the full implications of the latest American plan to end the year-long credit crunch.</p> <p>Fears that the public ownership, or \"conservatorship\", of the two US mortgage giants might provide only a temporary boost for the US housing market, and the world's financial system more generally, meant that an initial 300-point gain on Wall Street's main share index was pared back later in the day.</p> <p>Dealers in London were frustrated as the London Stock Exchange's computerised trading system froze barely an hour into the day. It had put on 200 points, or almost 4%. Angry traders said the shutdown was an embarrassment for London and the exchange, which is under huge pressure from rivals for the lucrative earnings in the world's third-largest stock market.</p> <p>By lunchtime in New York the Dow Jones industrial average was up 180 points, or 1.6%, at around 11,400. The dollar strengthened against the pound to around $1.748 as it rose to its highest level in nearly a year. </p> <p>The US treasury secretary, Hank Paulson, said that the quasi-nationalisation of the two US mortgage giants, announced on Sunday, was needed because the companies were running a \"flawed business model\" that should never have been allowed.</p> <p>The mortgage giants had to be bailed out because of their importance to the mortgage market and the financial system, Paulson said, adding that the government's plan made sure that taxpayers were protected, but that shareholders would not be insulated from losses. As he spoke shares in Freddie and Fannie shed more than 80% of their value on Friday to trade at just over $1 a share.</p> <p>Analysts said the Freddie and Fannie bailout - the largest in US history - was unlikely to mark the beginning of the end of the global credit crunch.</p> <p>\"Our view is that, rather than marking the turning point that assures an economic recovery, the support that has had to be provided to the two US mortgage giants over the weekend simply underlines the severity of the ongoing credit crisis,\" said Julian Jessop at Capital Economics in London. \"The bailout will help to avoid the worst case scenario of a complete financial meltdown, but the outlook for the housing market and the wider economy remains grim.\"</p> <p>News emerged yesterday that the departing chief executives of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, Richard Syron and Daniel Mudd, will take combined severance pay of $23m. George Bush said he did not view the nationalisation of the troubled lenders as a \"bailout\", but a \"stabilisation\" to calm markets after the sell-off in shares seen last week.</p> <p>A White House spokeswoman added that Bush had been warning Congress for years about the danger posed by the two mortgage institutions and had been calling for a strong independent regulator. </p> <p>Analysts also said figures from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Friday had shown that the embattled US housing market was in much worse shape than thought, giving added urgency to the need for action. The largest US savings and loan business, Washington Mutual, was put under special regulatory supervision and ousted its chief executive, Kerry Killinger, following rising losses related to the US sub-prime mortgage market. Washington Mutual lost $6.3bn in the last three quarters and has said losses in its mortgage portfolio could approach $19bn by 2011.</p> <p>Some analysts speculated that Fannie and Freddie were likely to be under state control for at least two years.</p> <p>Barack Obama and John McCain grudgingly welcomed the treasury takeover of the mortgage companies as a necessary short-term intervention. But Republicans favour handing their portion of the mortgage market to privatised companies. The Democrats want to retain a public role, arguing that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide mortgages for people who would not otherwise be able to afford them.</p>",
  "<p>Until a few months ago few people on this side of the Atlantic had heard of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government agencies that between them underwrite half the mortgages in the US. But as a result of Hank Paulson's rescue package at the weekend the importance of Fannie and Freddie, not just to the US home loans market but to the entire global financial system, became glaringly apparent.</p> <p>The US Treasury secretary feared that the looming failure of the two firms as a result of the losses made on the imploding US housing market would send shockwaves around the world. \"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are so large and so interwoven in our financial system that a failure of either of them would cause great turmoil in our financial markets here at home and around the globe,\" Paulson said. It was a fear shared in the UK, where banks and pension funds have been big buyers of bonds issued by the institutions.</p> <p><strong>Why were Fannie and Freddie so important to the world?</strong> </p> <p>The institutions issued bonds they marketed heavily to international investors. These bonds were attractive while the US housing market was strong, because they went up in value and were seen as the next best thing to US Treasury bills or government debt. They were bought by central banks around the world, by commercial banks looking for diverse portfolios and by pension funds, including those in the UK, looking for a safe home for their cash. The Bank of England allowed them to be used by banks in its emergency funding scheme designed to bolster the financial markets. Foreign investors increased their purchases of debt issued by Fannie and Freddie in recent years from $107bn (\u00a361bn) in 1994 to an estimated $1.3trillion.</p> <p>There were signs at the weekend that some of these investors were losing faith in Fannie and Freddie. They had cut their holdings of debt by about $18bn since a rescue package for the institutions was mooted in July, while putting more of their investments in Treasury bills. David Rosenberg at Merrill Lynch said: \"This unprecedented liquidation by the foreign central banks represented a dramatic loss of confidence on the part of an investor class which ... is a critical capital provider for the American dream.\"</p> <p>Government support means that anybody holding bonds in Fannie and Freddie has no risk of losing their money. That means that UK pension funds will emerge unscathed. It will be a different story for investors in the shares of the pair, where the pain will be deep and mainly confined to the US, where the authorities admit half a dozen banks could go bust as a result.</p> <p><strong>Fannie and Freddie stand behind most of the US banks.</strong></p> <p>Their role in the US financial system is crucial. They guarantee half the US mortgage market and provide support to small regional lenders as well as major international banking giants. They help to ensure there is enough financing to provide mortgages to would-be American home owners. In the housing market downturn their importance had become pronounced because as some lenders pulled back the two firms accounted for about 80% of new home loans. Paulson made it clear that as part of the government intervention housing finance costs in the US should be kept down for the next two years.</p> <p><strong>Will it make a difference to the UK housing market?</strong></p> <p>Quite what the impact will be on UK home owners remains to be seen. If the bailout of Freddie and Fannie bolsters confidence in the financial system then, eventually, UK mortgage lenders may again become more willing to grant home loans, though it could be a slow process.</p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive?</h2> <p>\"Yes. If you consider the most fundamental progressive ideals of all \u2013 equal opportunity and social mobility - it is clear that this Labour government has failed. </p> <p>\"Our plans for radical school reform - bringing the best education to the poorest children by opening up the state system to new providers - show we are not prepared to let ideology, dogma or vested interests stop children gaining the best start in life. We want to create genuine opportunities for people from any background to get on in life. </p> <p>\"And to address the growing gap in opportunity between children from rich and poor backgrounds, we have explicitly committed to the creation of a premium to be added to the per-pupil funding children from disadvantaged backgrounds receive. </p> <p>\"We want to ensure educational resources are targeted more effectively on those in need, to give incentives to schools to take children from more challenging backgrounds and to give incentives to new providers to locate in areas of greater disadvantage.\" </p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"David Cameron and George Osborne have been very clear that a Conservative government will not promise up-front, unfunded tax cuts at the next election.

But we are the party of low taxes for the long term, not tax cut promises for the short term. </p> <p>\"That is why David Cameron has said that a Conservative government will live within its means, by tackling the three cause of a bigger state and rising public spending. First, by tackling the costs of social failure, such as family breakdown, unemployment, and drug and alcohol addiction. </p> <p>\"Second, by tackling the cost of unreformed public services, improving the way they run through more choice, competition and non-state collective provision.

The EU also provides a unique means for us to work together with our European partners on shared challenges which Europe's nation states by themselves cannot deal with; and with enlargement, the goal of EU membership has persuaded not just governments but whole societies to raise their standards across the board.</p> <p>\"We want Britain to be a positive participant in the EU, championing liberal values. </p> <p>\"However, there is certainly a great deal that is wrong \u2013 the persistent attempts to take ever more powers from nation states, the mismanaged budget, the failures of the common fisheries policy and, sadly, more - which is why we have campaigned for reform and modernisation in the EU. We believe in an open, flexible Europe fit for the 21st century.</p> <p>\"If the EU has as its priorities the areas where it can make the most positive difference for its members and in the world - on global warming, global competitiveness and global poverty - and if it stops navel-gazing about institutions and doesn't try to impose unwanted top-down centralisation on its peoples then it can be an even stronger force for good in its second half-century. \"</p> <h2>7.

Taxes and<br>benefits should encourage families to stay together. So a Conservative<br>government will correct this by removing the anti-families bias, paying for<br>it from our new family fund, into which all extra green taxes will be put.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"Abortion is an issue of conscience and a free vote issue in parliament.<br>During the passage of the human fertilisation and embryology bill, David<br>Cameron voted to reduce the current time limit for abortion from 24 weeks to<br>22 weeks. </p> <p>He has said: 'I would like to see a reduction in the current limit, as it is clear that, due to medical advancement, many babies are surviving at 24 weeks'.\" </p> <p><strong>Interview by Mark Gould</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>Progressive.</p> <p>\"If you mean by that modern, up-to-date issues, then yes. But I think a key thing here is age. I have a lot of friends in the party, local and national, who tend to be a lot younger \u2013 those that grew up at the end of the cold war \u2013 so we're not the same breed as our predecessors, who moralised over social issues.\" </p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"The taxes need to come down, and they will, but it is impossible to say what they will be on at the present. The options available to the Treasury, in terms of borrowing, will be very difficult. I'm particularly interested in seeing stamp duty for first-time buyers go and taxes for families reduced.\"<br> </p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"I'd agree with what Cameron set out in terms of cutting public spending, which has only been defined for the next year or so. After that, all we can say is that we need to invest more into public services without taking more money from the taxpayer.\" </p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"The environment is a very important issue to me as a young man, but it's incorrect to start calling things green taxes. It's not about raising taxes, but changing attitudes. I would say that it is wrong to start taxing people retrospectively, punishing them for decisions they made without knowing they might get taxed in future. I'm also keen on fuel duty to change with the price of oil, so that when the price of oil goes up, we reduce the levy.\" </p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"It's difficult to say, obviously, because you're talking about seven years from now. Its easy to sit back and look at it academically \u2013 we'll put up taxes here and change them there \u2013 but it has to be about what's reasonable and what people can afford.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"No to withdrawal, but the system has to be massively reformed. We should only be involved at the highest level in Europe. We've gone so far into integration, too far to my mind. The reality is that the longer we don't put this to the public, the more integrated we become. I am also strongly against the single currency.\" </p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"We're right to look at it, if it needs changing. Crime is our number-one issue, but so is massive teenage pregnancy. There are huge problems coming from single-parent families. By promoting marriage, which offers \u00a31,000 extra per household, per year, a lot of people would go for that in my constituency. But it needs to be part of a package of other policies and I think we'll see that soon.\" </p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"If I was in parliament, I would have certainly pursued the issue more closely. But I would be sympathetic to a slight reduction. I applaud the idea of free votes on moral issues, though.\"</p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"I think being progressive is something that most politicians would hope to identify with, but in reality very few are. </p> <p>\"In terms of inclusiveness it is absolutely essential to be progressive. I think the Conservative party are moving into areas that it is not traditionally associated with and if we want to reconnect with the public then we have to address issues that are important across the whole of society; we can't just be connecting with the top 10-20%, but with the bottom 10-20%.</p> <p>\"This means bringing in a fairness agenda to ensure there is equal opportunity for people to achieve their aspirations. The fairness agenda has always been dominated by the left, which was always seen as the party helping people out in difficulty, but in today's fluid political debate people change how they vote and see things more easily. You can afford to exclude or ignore people if you want to build a fair society, you can't leave people behind. </p> <p>\"I think [David] Cameron fundamentally believes in a new politics, a progressive type of politics that reaches out to parts of the country the Conservatives haven't traditionally reached.\" </p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"You simply can't offer tax cuts until you get into government and see what type of state the country's finances are in. It would be foolhardy to promise a whole raft of tax cuts at this stage. We believe in a lower tax economy but we have to have a relatively cautious approach.\" </p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"You can't make that decision yet, but I do think we should be moving the tax burden away from families and on to other areas such as green taxes. It is difficult to imagine real cuts in public spending but I think we will see slightly lower increases than we have seen in the past. The large increases in public spending that we have seen are, in the long term, unsustainable. What we need to see is a shift away from inputs towards outputs, and that is more of a challenge.\" </p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"I think this is something that David Cameron is personally committed to. We do need to put a price on the environment and pollution. It's difficult; we need to reduce the burden on families and I can't envisage higher VAT levels on fuel, for example, but on the other hand we do need to deal with climate change.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"In an ideal world after four years of a Conservative government you would want to be significantly down the road of having a lower level of taxation. But at the moment we can't predict whether that will be possible, we can only indicate that we believe in lower taxes as a vehicle for economic generation and social mobility.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"I think we have gained in many different ways by our membership of Europe, in terms of influencing and shaping the single market for example. But there are problems \u2013 there is a real disconnection between the bureaucratic agenda and what the people want. I think the referendum on the Lisbon treaty in Ireland brought that sharply into focus; it was clear that all the political parties were on one side and the public were on the other. People just don't feel that Europe represents their priorities, and we have all the issues around it being a gravy train with expenses etc. </p> <p>\"Europe needs to change. It needs to address why people feel so disconnected from it instead of trying to grow an ever-bigger agenda. </p> <p>\"There is not a case for Britain to withdraw from the EU; it's finding a situation that we are comfortable with, and that means defining its limits. We need to be a valued player and work together on cross-national issues such as the environment or terrorism but we do not want to see an ever-increasing union. If that is the direction we are going in, then we need to ask the people exactly what they want.\" </p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status</h2> <p>\"We have to recognise commitment whether that means marriage, civil partnership or long-term commitment.\" </p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"I followed the debate and it is a very emotive and personal issue. I was persuaded on balance that the limit should be reduced slightly to 20 or 22 weeks.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Alexandra Topping</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"What I mean by progressive is ensuring equality of opportunity for everybody irrespective of background. I went to a state school in south London and was lucky enough to make it to Oxford. There are too few kids leaving the state system now that are given that opportunity. We want to target tax cuts to people on lower incomes as an incentive to work and a reward for doing so.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"It's a little bit too early to say anything meaningful because the public finances are in such a bad condition.\" </p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"There is clearly a massive national debt and limited room for manoeuvres for any new government.\" </p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"Policy should be driven by carbon taxes offset by relief on income tax or elsewhere \u2026 If oil prices go down the duty should be increased slightly to offset this and vice versa if prices go up. In general taxes should be on carbon use and offset with incentives elsewhere. Coercion is no good. We need to create a series of incentives so we can let people go their own way. Gordon Brown imposed green taxes on less fuel-efficient cars and it was simply a stealth tax.\"</p> <h2>5 Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%.

Public services need to be properly funded. I don't think you can cut tax at the expense of public services though.</p> <p>\"[In response to the suggestion that 10 years ago it would have been rare to have heard a Tory make such a statement:] 10 years ago I wouldn't have voted Tory myself; that is what is so progressive about this party \u2013 letting people on low incomes keep more of their earnings.</p> <p>\"There are two different ways of achieving the objectives. You can have vast, state-controlled systems with no autonomy where tax is collected and handed back in various credits, or you go our way by devolving power to schools, hospitals and allowing more choice of public service providers.\"</p> <h2>6 Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"I'm not sure I can give a really detailed answer on this \u2014 what I would like to see the EU become is a federation of sovereign states. It promotes free trade, which is great. I haven't really drawn up a balance sheet but I don't think we should withdraw.\"</p> <h2>7 Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"I want a tax system that provides for couples to live together to bring up children together.

  "<h2>1 Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"Yes I am because we have to move forward, beyond some of the issues this government has destroyed. We have to be progressive to deal with family values. We have to be progressive as radical changes are needed to deal with the issues at hand. I believe that certain values should be maintained. It is the setting of values that allows people more freedom. I am a traditionalist in that sense but I am also a progressive.</p> <p>\"[On student debt:] How is it that in some countries students have their tuition fees paid but we don't?

Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"The Conservative party have a real problem. When they take control they'll find out that Labour have been borrowing more than they say they have. We need to look very carefully at the books to find out what we can do and what is needed.

  "<p>British American Tobacco has become the latest UK company to be targeted in Russia with threats of legal action by the country's consumer rights agency, Rospotrebnadzor. </p> <p>Gennady Onishchenko, director of Rospotrebnadzor, said yesterday that he had signed a lawsuit against BAT for \"misleading\" consumers and infringing their rights, although he would not give details.</p> <p>A few weeks ago he attacked the wider global tobacco companies, threatening them with legal action for \"nicotine genocide\", allegedly for making huge profits at the expense of Russians' health. </p> <p>Yesterday Onishchenko repeated those claims, saying the tobacco producers viewed Russia as \"an uncivilised market where they can sell dangerous and poisonous products\". </p> <p>BAT said last night that it had received no claims from the regulator, but stressed it always acted inside the law. The London-based group has been a keen purchaser of local tobacco companies and has also found Russia a growing market for its top brands, such as Dunhill and Kent.</p> <p>Western companies in the oil and mining sectors have faced similar attacks by environmental and financial watchdogs, which have usually been interpreted as attempts by the Kremlin to crack down on foreign firms.</p> <p>Last week BP agreed to make wholesale changes to the management structure of its TNK-BP joint venture - including the removal of its chief executive, Robert Dudley, a former BP man. Shell handed over a large share of its Sakhalin gas field business to the state-owned Gazprom after destabilising criticism from regulators.</p> <p>The relationship between Russia and western investors has been soured by military intervention in Georgia. UK-Russian relations are poor since the killing in London of Alexander Litvinenko.</p> <p>BAT said no claim from the consumer body would be justified. \"We have yet to receive an official claim from Mr Onishchenko on this subject, so are not aware of any details.\" Market watchers said the suit was likely to focus on \"light\" and \"superlight\" labelling on cigarette packs.</p> <p>The Kremlin has acknowledged that the country must do more to combat smoking. Russia recently ratified the World Health Organisation's framework convention on tobacco control, which mandates a series of measures within five years, including higher prices for cigarettes.</p>",
  "<p>After a weekend of heavy rain, the forecast remains gloomy for the week ahead. The rain will keep on falling in the months and years to come as Britain experiences flooding on an increasingly dramatic scale. By now we all know, or should know, that continuing to build on floodplains is not a very good idea. Unless we begin to design a new generation of buildings on stilts, or learn how to raise land up from the water as the Dutch do, or design new towns along the lines of Venice, then we should abandon all plans to build where waters are likely to rise.</p> <p>Will we? Not a chance. In Britain floodplains are cheap land. We want lots of cheap new housing, ever more supermarkets, major roads, distribution depots and heavy traffic to serve the latest low-cost estates. You can see these homes currently marching their way along the flanks of Ely in Cambridgeshire, capital of the water-sodden Fens, and, in particular, along the length of the Thames Gateway, the lands along the Essex and Kent banks of the Thames. We should be very wary indeed of building here.</p> <p>Governments want targets for low-cost housing to be met. Regeneration quangos and local authorities go along with this, a dim tide of witless development that would have had Noah knocking up an ark even before God had warned him of the Great Flood to come.</p> <p>If we must build on floodplains, then we need to spend huge sums of money on long-term investment in either flood defences or new forms of architecture, building, land use and urban planning. We need to invest in major drainage programmes. We need to ensure that the majority of new homes are built well above projected flood levels. Lower down, new houses really do need to be raised on stilts and even provided with boats. We might build a number of small towns set above floodwater moats. We could design modern pumping stations as attractive as the windmills that performed this job in the Fens two and three hundred years ago. Or, of course, we could settle in a limited number of modern towers, each fitted out with shops, nurseries, clinics, libraries, cinemas and schools, as well as flats with long views across floodplains and estuaries. Earlier this summer, the Royal Institute of British Architects launched an international design competition for flood-proof housing; the rising water level is fast becoming the architectural challenge of the day. The problem is that the most interesting and innovative designs are often far more expensive than conventional homes.</p> <p>Such ambitious projects, however, have been realised in the past. From the mid-1920s, the Italian fascist government drained the malarial Pontine marshes of the Lazio region, south of Rome. This vast area had been almost uninhabited since its major rivers began to flood some while before the Roman republic gave way to the Augustan empire. Mussolini's Opera Nazionale Combattenti fought a decade long battle to resettle the region, and succeeded. Today, the distinctive new towns of the 1930s, such as Sabaudia, thrive, and half a million people now live in the region. </p> <p>In our own altogether more pragmatic way, the marshes, meres and bogs of the Fens have been drained and made into fertile agricultural land, as long ago as the 17th century. But it was only in the 19th century, when steam pumps cranked into action, that the Fens were fully reclaimed from the tides of flood water. Today some 300 pumping engines and 3,800 miles of artificial channels are needed to keep the water at bay, day-in, day-out.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the magnificent Thames Barrier, built for the former Greater London Council between 1977 and 1984, does its best to keep London safe from serious floods. There is talk of a second and much bigger estuarine barrier straddling the Thames between Sheerness and Southend. Scientists working for Thames Estuary 2001, a research project formed by the Environment Agency, announced the idea three years ago. They pointed out that London and the south-east is slowly tipping into the sea, while sea levels themselves are rising and predicted to rise very quickly if the Arctic cap melts. A new barrier would protect not just the Thames estuary, but would also be used to generate electricity. Despite the urgency of the task, no dates have yet been set for the construction of a second barrier; nor, research apart, has money been set aside for the project. Meanwhile, the overlapping development plans which add up to the Thames Gateway are certain to go ahead, recession or no recession. We tend to prefer short-term fixes in a ruthlessly commercial new Britain. Future generations can sort things out for themselves when the flood waters come, as they will have to. </p> <p>It seems unlikely that the government will, in the near future, open its purse and direct its imagination toward shaping new towns along the lines of a new and technically improved Venice - much less pursue such ambitious programmes as the draining of the Fens or the Pontine Marshes. Events might just force us to build on stilts or to live on boats. Meanwhile, as long we can sprawl unsustainably across cheap land, we will continue to do so with official as well as commercial blessing. Only a disaster of epic proportions will teach us to plan ahead, as a hard and ever harder rain falls.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Sunday September 14 2008. <br>Ely is in Cambridgeshire, not Norfolk.

  "<p>Piled up next to the road were bicycles and benches, rolled up mattresses and squawking chickens, radios with wonky antennas, battered suitcases and yellow jerry cans. Amid it all, wearing an oversized blue blazer and plastic sandals, sat 85-year-old Michael Bihonzi. With a walking stick in one hand and a floppy hat in the other, he stared at the green hills he had long given up hope of ever seeing again. </p> <p>More than three decades had passed since Bihonzi fled ethnic massacres in Burundi that left up to 200,000 people dead. In a Tanzanian refugee camp he found safety and peace, but not in his heart. So when offered the chance to return home for the first time since 1972, Bihonzi did not hesitate to climb on a truck with 23 of his children and grandchildren and cross the border. </p> <p>\"I have come to reclaim my land,\" he said after his arrival in the southern Makamba province, while waiting for another truck to take him to the village where he grew up. \"And then I can die.\"</p> <p>Bihonzi's homecoming is a part of a final repatriation of refugees to a country that at last appears destined for a definitive peace. Nearly a tenth of Burundi's 8 million people fled between 1972 and 2003, a period of \"slow genocide\" where the ruling Tutsi elite used force to suppress the Hutu majority, eventually triggering all-out civil war. </p> <p>But over the past five years stability has steadily increased. With mediation efforts led by South Africa and Tanzania - Burundi is one country where \"an African solution to an African problem\" has worked - the fighting has all but stopped. </p> <p>More than 450,000 refugees have already returned. Now, with the last active rebel group in Burundi, the Forces for National Liberation, showing willingness to lay down its arms and join President Pierre Nkurunziza's government, Tanzania is closing the remaining refugee camps near its western border that still housed 320,000 Burundians at the beginning of the year. </p> <p>About 90,000 of them had fled Burundi during the 1990s, and now are arriving home at the rate of several thousand a week. The other 220,000 asylum seekers - the so-called \"1972 refugees\" - were given a chance to stay. The Tanzanian government said they could be naturalised, an offer whose scale may be unprecedented in Africa. But 46,000 people, including Bihonzi's family, chose instead to accept a \u00a323 cash grant from the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), which is managing the repatriation effort, load up to 100kg (220lb) of possessions on a truck, and go home. </p> <p>\"Coming back takes a lot of guts because they were fine in Tanzania and reintegration is difficult,\" said William Mututa, UNCHR's office head in Makamba. \"But most say, 'We love our country' and that their problems will be sorted out in time.\"</p> <p>The problems are many. Burundi has a shattered economy and the lowest per capita gross national income in sub-Saharan Africa. Outside the main towns, most people rely on subsistence farming. But the hills are densely populated, and competition for land is intense. </p> <p>Many of the 1972 refugees returning to their old villages are finding the land that was once theirs is occupied. Established late last year, the state-run Land and Other Properties Commission, which helps returning refugees recover their assets, has already registered more than 10,000 land and 18,000 property conflicts. </p> <p>Katebo Ngarama, 62, is one of the claimants. He abandoned his family home in Nyanza Lac, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, in 1972 when, in response to a Hutu insurrection, the Tutsi-dominated army began slaughtering all Hutus with even a basic education. Fleeing on foot, Ngarama took with him his wife, his parents and two pairs of trousers. </p> <p>Like most Burundians at the time, Ngarama's father did not have a title deed. When Ngarama arrived home in May, the family now using his land angrily refused to move. For a few weeks he feared for his safety - one returning refugee was savagely attacked when he pitched tent on his former plot. Now, however, Ngaramba is on speaking terms with the family on his land, and is considering offering them half the plot to settle the dispute. If resolved amicably, it will be a good omen for his children, who were all born in Tanzania, and are the main reason that he returned.</p> <p>\"I always dreamed of coming back to show them that this is their country too,\" Ngarama said. \"They can decide for themselves if it is bad or good.\"</p> <p>Other returning refugees, especially those who fled when they were young, have no claim to land, and no idea of where their home villages are. For now they are being housed in corrugated iron shelters in temporary camps in southern Burundi. </p> <p>The authorities have promised to build them houses, with the help of the UN, and there is even talk of building entire villages for the landless. But the plans are moving slowly. Already the promises of free healthcare and schooling made by government officials who visited the camps in Tanzania last year are sounding a bit hollow to some. </p> <p>At the Gitara temporary camp, on the edge of a dirt road cutting through the hills of Makamba, Isaie Niyongabo, his wife and six children were among the 50 families who have been awaiting housing since March. The government had given them clothing and rice, but they were eager to start a more normal life.</p> <p>\"Our children need to go to school,\" said Niyongabo, who left Burundi when he was nine. \"They need to learn to speak Kirundi and French, not just English and Swahili like in Tanzania.\"</p> <p>In their decades outside the country, many of the refugees have managed to temper their anger over their forced exile, and now talk vaguely of \"the war\" or \"the trouble\" that drove them away. But for some the homecoming has made forgetting impossible. Francois Nyabenda has his house back but must also each morning walk past the banana grove where his father and brother were murdered. It was difficult to deal with, he said, but so far he had no regrets about leaving Tanzania. Neither did Eliphas Cubwa, 73, who returned last month to Nyanza Lac after 36 years away. </p> <p>\"When you live in another country which is not yours you live like a slave,\" he said. \"It is not your grandparents' country.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>For most of Burundi's post-colonial history, political and military power was in the hands of an elite from the <strong>Tutsi </strong>ethnic group, who make up <strong>14% </strong>of the population, compared with the <strong>85% </strong>who are <strong>Hutu</strong>. In <strong>2005</strong>, after the signing of a <strong>peace agreement </strong>to end more than a decade of civil war, former Hutu rebel leader <strong>Pierre Nkurunziza </strong>was elected president. <strong>Power-sharing </strong>is now enshrined in the constitution, with a <strong>60:40 split </strong>between Hutus and Tutsis. The last remaining rebel movement, the <strong>FNL</strong>, is Hutu-based, like the ruling party, and some believe political dynamics have fundamentally changed from the pre-2005 days.</p>",

I don't like top-down, controlling governments I want to provide for my own family, a little taxation as possible so that I can make decisions about my own life and the Tories are far more progressive in allowing me to do that. I am the governor of a first school in Redditch teachers say there is too much government control they have had enough. If schools are not good enough we should be able to change them.

It's good to encourage enlargement; that can only be good. What I don't like is its top-down powers, less interference in nation states' matters, mismanaged budgets.

Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"If you asked me this five years ago I would have said: 'No, 24 weeks is fine, I am pro-a woman's choice to have an abortion.' But I think that if I had been asked to vote I would have wanted a closer look at the medical evidence for 24 weeks as so much is being done now that 24-week babies survive. I am pro-choice but I might have gone for 22 weeks.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Mark Gould</strong></p>",
  "<p>The most famous manager in the world was looking for a job and the FA had a vacancy. Here was a recruitment process as simple as it was expensive. Later the ruling body was to set a target of at least a semi-final appearance at the next World Cup or Euro 2012. It would have been a slur to ask any less of Fabio Capello, considering all that he has achieved in the past.</p> <p>If he is to live up to that expectation it will not be through visionary football. The Italian has never had much truck with idealism. Even Milan's magisterial 4-0 win in the 1994 European Cup final, when circumstances forced him to employ an uncommonly artistic line-up featuring Dejan Savicevic, had been preceded by Johan Cruyff's ill-advised boast that it was his Barcelona team <br>that embodied football at its purest and most advanced.</p> <p>Capello's reputation is for getting the job done by whatever means are required. This practicality, unfortunately, is exactly what England need nowadays. The interest in the national team is always great and, in that overheated environment, it is easy to forget how disproportionate it can be to the actual status of the squad.</p> <p>Jermain Defoe has not only started the last four matches for England but was expected to do so. However, he chose Portsmouth because Dimitar Berbatov and Robbie Keane had reduced his opportunities at Tottenham. Emile Heskey might appear instead of Defoe in the line-up for tomorrow's match with Croatia, but he, similarly, was put on the course to his current club, Wigan, via Birmingham City, because Liverpool were ready to offload him.</p> <p>Glen Johnson, another member of the Portsmouth staff, was in the line-up against Andorra at the weekend and he, also, had found the competition too keen at his previous club, Chelsea. Though this could be a cue for fulmination about foreign mercenaries suffocating local talent, Capello, a soldier of fortune himself, cannot take that stance.</p> <p>He goes no further than the occasional reference to the limited number of eligible players. Ideally, he would have a group of Englishman who, in a cosmopolitan environment, had been provoked to reach a high standard as they triumphantly established themselves at the leading clubs. There are people in that category, but not quite enough of them.</p> <p>The players available to Sven-Goran Eriksson were, broadly speaking, in better shape than they are now. For Capello, the prosaic style of Wayne Rooney is not so much a mystery as a vexation. No one forgets what the attacker was like when on the loose at Euro 2004. What became of the then teenager who ran amok on his debut for Manchester United later that year?</p> <p>In that meeting with Fenerbahce in the Champions League, he brought up his hat-trick after almost barging team-mates aside so that he could take the free-kick that, inexorably, hit the net. A professional, adult career is not conducted in that brazen, intuitive way, but it is galling that Rooney, for all his skill, is yet to attain a mature superiority that will let him overwhelm the opposition again. </p> <p>The public at large appreciates how much lies with a handful of players. Accordingly there was dismay at the exclusion of Michael Owen from the current squad. Capello's verdict that the forward is not fully fit is incontrovertible. Indeed, injury problems contributed to a four-month period last season where he produced a single goal.</p> <p>To many people, the issue of his physical condition is an irrelevance so long as the predator's instinct continues to flicker inside him. That willingness to depend on Owen in all circumstances is its own commentary on the dearth of alternatives. Even the stoic Capello has to snatch at whatever opportunities arise to cheer himself up.</p> <p>After the win over Andorra, he responded to questions about Theo Walcott with real approval. As the press conference was ending he spontaneously threw in more compliments for the 19-year-old. This might indicate that there will be a use for his pace on the break against Croatia, but it reflects, too, the manager's consciousness of restricted choice. </p> <p>He must take encouragement where he can find it. All in all, he will feel justified in imposing the pragmatism that is his natural stance. In Zagreb we will see how well he can neutralise the midfield verve that is the key to Croatia's success. Capello could achieve all that the FA asks, but there will have to be judicious ugliness along the way.</p>",

We could change from taxing jobs etc to green taxes so we can adapt the way people behave. What I don't want to see is an increase in the burden on families through overall taxation on families.

If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"It probably gained. You can't get away from the fact that we have successfully done business for more than 30 years. The actual institution of the EU has many problems though. It takes too much power from nation states and can't manage its budget. We need to try and push the EU in a more open and flexible position that looks outwards. It can play a real part in tackling global poverty and issues like that but it shouldn't try and become a global state. </p> <p>\"I don't think we should withdraw from the EU. We have benefited from being a member through the many trade opportunities it has brought. We're too far in to talk about withdrawing but we need to make our membership work for us. I can't see how this country will ever pull out of the EU, we've been in it for too long. </p> <p>\"I think there should be a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.

  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"Yes I do. I joined the Conservative party because I believe in progressive politics and I think making people responsible for their own lives is part of being progressive. </p> <p>\"I think the Conservative party has changed in terms of perception if nothing else. I think the party allowed themselves to be portrayed as a party that was out of touch with people in the 90s. That really has changed. I think the Conservative party has made a huge effort to discuss issues that real people are concerned about. Rather than concentrate on the future of the EU we have moved away from subjects that interest the political class to issues that concern real people in this country.\" </p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"The tax situation is very interesting. As someone who stood in 2005, I can really say that it has moved up the political agenda. It would be irresponsible to make tax-cut commitments but that doesn't mean that we can't have a more targeted and fair tax system, moving the tax burden away from employment to other issues such as the environment. But our first first priority is to ensure the financial solvency of the country. I am very happy with the way that David Cameron has deal with this issue.\" </p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"I think cuts in public spending will be very difficult to achieve, but I do not doubt that there are ways of saving money, although that is always easier said than done. We do need to see public spending growing at a slower rate than the economy. We need to look at the long-term situation, and ultimately we need to have tax at a lower percentage of GDP.\"</p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"I am not saying that we definitely need to see green tax increases but we do need to look at an overall reform of the tax system.

But at the moment it's impossible to say. In an ideal world we would like to see a reduction in the tax burden, but whether that can be achieved in the first term we just don't know yet.\" </p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"I think Europe has been a difficult issue for all parties, not just the Conservatives. </p> <p>\"I personally support our membership of the EU and feel that as a free trade area it is very important. But there are clearly things that make the situation far from ideal and there needs to be a clear shift in priorities. The lack of transparency is clearly problematic as is the lack of democracy and the increasing centralising tendency. But we have to be careful not to throw out the baby with the bathwater. Do I think we should stay in Europe? Absolutely. Have we benefited from the EU? On balance, I would say yes. Is it perfect? No, not by a long way.\" </p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status</h2> <p>\"I think this is an important point. At the moment the tax system penalises married couples, which is clearly not a good thing. But I do think that parents raising children should be treated equally alongside those that are married. We are not saying that being married is not the only way to raise children or the only way to create a stable society, but it clearly should not be advantageous for couples with children to remain unmarried. I don't think that being married should be the only option; clearly we have moved on since the 1950s. I believe civil partnerships should also be recognised and that it is the stability of the relationship that should be recognised, rather than just marriage.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"I think it should be reduced. I am not anti-abortion. W do not live in an ideal society but there is a viable opportunity for survival at 24 weeks.

  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"Yes. I'm a Conservative councillor in Tower Hamlets, one of the most deprived parts of the country, and am the parliamentary candidate for the marginal new consistency of Poplar and Limehouse, an east London seat that encompasses the wealth of Canary Wharf and some of the poorest estates in London and the country. <br> \"I've been elected as a councillor in Tower Hamlets, which is a naturally Labour area; before 2004 there had never been a Conservative on the council ever before. In Tower Hamlets the Conservatives are the party fighting for local people to ensure they get a fair deal. We want to make sure that local people have the opportunities to take advantage of the economic engine that's on our doorstep in the form of Canary Wharf. </p> <p>\"We want to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, not by unfair taxation but by giving people the best start in life and the opportunities to make their lives better. For example, Labour have made a small advance in school reform by, for example, the development of local academies. In Tower Hamlets the Labour-run council turned down the offer of \u00a34m from Goldman Sachs to invest in two schools under the academy scheme. I supported this investment as it would bring much needed cash to our local schools and give local children a better start in life. Labour turned down the money as they seem to want to perpetuate the problem of local people not having the opportunities to better themselves. It seems to suit Labour to keep people down. Now which is the more progressive? <br> \"Finally, I was selected as the parliamentary candidate by an open primary, where almost 100 local residents from the East End of London came to choose who they wanted as their candidate.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"By nature Conservatives believe in low taxes, giving people choice over how they spend, invest and save their hard-earned money. It also keeps our economy competitive internationally. We're in difficult economic times so our ability to offer more tax cuts is limited. And with Labour being fresh out of ideas, offering more tax cuts simply gives them more ideas to pinch!\"</p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"A combination of both; some taxes are unfair and they should be replaced (inheritance tax, stamp duty for first-time buyers). Some aspects of public spending could be cut, for example the money wasted on the New Deal, which has not delivered.\"</p> <h2>4.

  "<p>The current panic about Russia is a curious phenomenon. By any objective standard Russians are freer in the authoritarian state established by Putin than at any time in the Soviet Union. Many are also materially better off. Russia has abandoned global expansionism, and is now a diminished version of what it has been throughout most of its history - a Eurasian empire whose chief concern is protection from external threats. Yet western attitudes are more hostile than they were during much of the cold war, when many on the left viewed the Soviet Union, which was responsible for tens of millions of deaths, as an essentially benign regime.</p> <p>To see how this state of affairs has come about one must understand the progressive narrative - embraced nowadays as much on the right as the left - that shapes western perceptions. The Soviet collapse was a defeat for communism, a prototypical progressive ideology. There was never any prospect of post-communist Russia embracing neoliberalism, another western model. Something like Putin's Russia was always on the cards, but the return of history isn't part of the progressive script. Most of our leaders are disciples of Woodrow Wilson, with a religious faith in what Francis Fukuyama only the other day described as \"the march of history towards global democracy\". Prosperity brings bourgeoisification and liberal values, or so they believe. Russia - rich, nationalist and authoritarian - doesn't fit this progressive fairytale, and the west's reaction is a mix of threatening bluster and mounting panic.</p> <p>Nothing is more misguided than talk of a new cold war. What we are seeing is the end of the post cold war era, and a renewal of geopolitical conflicts of the sort that occurred during the late 19th century. Their minds befogged by fashionable nonsense about globalisation, western leaders believe liberal democracy is spreading unstoppably. The reality is continuing political diversity. Republics, empires, liberal and illiberal democracies, and a wide variety of authoritarian regimes will be with us for the foreseeable future. Globalisation is nothing more than the industrialisation of the planet, and increasing resource nationalism is an integral part of the process. (So is accelerating climate change, but that's another story.) As industrialisation spreads, countries that control natural resources use these resources to advance their strategic objectives. In deploying energy as a weapon Russia is not resisting globalisation but exploiting its contradictions.</p> <p>We are back to great-power politics, shifting alliances and spheres of influence. The difference is that the west is no longer in charge. With their different histories and sometimes sharply conflicting interests, Russia, China, India and the Gulf states are not going to form any kind of bloc. But it is these countries that are shaping world development at the start of the 21st century. The US - its bankrupt mortgage institutions nationalised and its gigantic war machine effectively funded by foreign borrowing - is in steep decline. With its financial system in the worst mess since the 1930s, the west's ability to shape events is dwindling by the day. Sermonising about \"law-based international relations\" is laughable after Iraq, and at bottom not much more than nostalgia for a vanished hegemony. </p> <p>Deluded about its true place in the world, the west underestimates the risks of intervening in Russia's near abroad. Russia's weaknesses - demographic decline, cronyism in the economy and a seething sense of national humiliation - are well known, but western vulnerabilities are no less real. Our leaders bore on about Russia needing us as much as we need Russia. In fact, despite a recent blip, investment in Russia is a byproduct of the global market that will continue for as long as it continues to be profitable, whereas Russian energy supplies can be curtailed at will by the Russian government. Economists will tell you the country is too reliant on oil. But the world's oil reserves are peaking while globalisation continues to advance, and Russia stands to gain from any international conflict in which supplies are disrupted. Again, the west needs Russia if the Iranian nuclear crisis is ever to be defused peacefully, and without Russian logistical cooperation Nato forces will find it even harder to bring the aimless, unwinnable war in Afghanistan to any kind of conclusion.</p> <p>Right-thinking bien-pensants in all parties believe Russia would be more amenable to western interests if only it were more truly democratic. But Putin is wildly popular precisely because he is asserting Russian power against the west; if he were more accountable to public opinion he might be harder to deal with. Democracy has numerous advantages, but it is no guarantee of a reasonable foreign policy. The current Georgian imbroglio is itself a spin-off from democratic politics. Mikheil Saakashvili's reckless incursion into South Ossetia, where Russian forces had been stationed under international agreements for 16 years, was most likely encouraged by elements in the Bush administration in the hope of damaging Obama in the run-up to the presidential election. The gambit may have worked, but the result has been a conflict that increases Russia's leverage over the flow of oil in the region and strengthens Iran in central Asia. If Dick Cheney's pledge of support for Georgia during his travels last week was a move in the Great Game it was spectacularly ill judged.</p> <p>Clearly, with the exception of some in \"old Europe\", our leaders do not know what they are doing. The grandstanding of David Miliband and David Cameron in Ukraine illustrates the point. Blathering about national self-determination and territorial integrity, they seem not to have noticed that the two principles are normally incompatible. Self-determination means secession and the break-up of states. In the Caucasus, a region of multi-sided national enmities, it means a wider war and worsening ethnic cleansing. The stakes are even higher in Ukraine. Deeply divided and with a major Russian naval base in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, the new state will surely be torn apart if an attempt is made to wrench it from Russia's sphere of influence. The country would become a battlefield, with the great powers irresistibly drawn in. Playing with Wilsonian notions of self-determination in these conditions is courting disaster.</p> <p>Let there be no mistake: Russia is, in some respects, a dangerous state. With their background in the security services, its leaders are ruthless pragmatists who will use any means to achieve their objectives. Their goal may be to roll back western influence in Russia's near abroad, but their strategy is to take whatever they can. Perceiving the west to be in decline, they are testing whether it has any coherent strategy to protect its interests. From what we have heard from our leaders, it does not.</p> <p>A start would be to shelve plans for further Nato expansion, while making it unequivocally clear that existing commitments in eastern Europe and the Baltic states will be honoured. At the same time every effort must be made to reduce Europe's dependency on Russian energy. Western leaders need to acquire a capacity for realistic thinking, or else they will be woken from their dream of progress by the force of events.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Gray is emeritus professor of European thought at the LSE.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

No \u2013 and by now a fair few of those do not think Nato is much help in lowering the tensions in eastern Europe, anyway.</p> <p>We may only have four months of the Cheshire cat grin of the 43rd president of the United States, and the Halloween pumpkin scowl of his vice president, but we are going to have live for a long time with what they have done to their country and the world. The next president will likely spend most of his term trying to clear away the debris. He will have to re-examine the strategy built from the 9/11 attacks, the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, nuclear proliferation and Iran, China, Korea and the Caucasus. </p> <p>He can continue along the lines of the Cheney-Rumsfeld playbook of muscle-bound military might and isolationism. Or he could follow in the legacy of the great internationalist policy-makers of recent US history, Harry Truman and Acheson, Nixon and Kissinger closing Vietnam and opening to China, and George H W Bush, Brent Scowcroft and James Baker, who ensured with Gorbachev that the cold war didn't end in violence. </p> <p>From here the McCain-Palin, Obama-Biden teams did not appear particularly well placed or equipped to clear up the mess after the geopolitical Hurricanes W and Dick. It is widely believed that my former colleague Prof Samantha Power was fired from the Obama team not for being rude about Hillary, but for warning publicly that the US wouldn't get out of Iraq as quickly and easily as Barack imagined. </p> <p>If W is right, and McCain is going to follow him in using 9/11 as a licence for anything, particularly gross bad behaviour like Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, then we are all in trouble \u2013 particularly the US allies, and not least the UK. The slavish attachment of London to Washington under Tony Blair is a continuing problem, the \"shoulder to shoulder\" and \"hug 'em close\" baloney and the folly of endorsing such a weird notion as the \"global war on terror\" included. This is the elephant in the front room of Britain's position today, a creature about whom Gordon Brown and David Miliband, his foreign secretary, seem to be in complete denial. </p> <p>The fundamental error of the fatal friendship of the Bush-Blair era was that they believed their own propaganda about US military might and the doctrine of \"full spectrum dominance\". The US has fantastic gizmos for surveillance and reconnaissance, but they are not all-powerful. A retired US colonel in charge of artillery and rocket systems procurement for the US Army told me with pride of the 'unbeatable superiority' of US forces in Iraq. He was mesmerised by a bit of kit called FBCB2 \u2013 which is rather like a souped-up Tom Tom GPS guidance navigation system in cars. \"It can tell you where every friendly vehicle is positioned,\" he marvelled. That's the problem \u2013 and why the Brits went cool on a similar system called Blue Force Tracker. As the US forces in Fallujah discovered, it tell you where the friendly forces are, almost in unnecessary detail, but it couldn't tell you where the enemy's snipers and booby traps are \u2013 and it cannot look into men's minds.</p> <p>US forces in Afghanistan seem to be facing similar problems. Despite the satellites, the Reaper and Global Hawk pilotless spy planes, the controllers \u2013 often back in the United States \u2013 cannot tell the difference between an Afghan wedding party and a shooting party. We are now getting reports every other day from Pakistan and Afghanistan of accusations of Nato \u2013 US commanded \u2013 strikes by planes and <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gT8vt-omKBx6L67n0qn8q00d27lw\">drones killing civilians</a>.</p> <p>In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, the UK seems to be operating more to an American operation and plan \u2013 cooked up primarily for US domestic consumption. The US is about to \"surge\" another brigade, somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 extra troops, into Afghanistan for a renewed offensive in the borderlands with Pakistan. British and Australian special forces, as in Iraq, will be expected to help in the fray to an American plan and to American standards of behaviour. </p> <p>Before they commit to new American operations in Afghanistan, the British should reflect on the audit of all their efforts in Iraq at US behest. Already British forces are heavily committed in Helmand and Kandahar. The recent operation to get a huge new turbine to the hydro-electric station at Kijaki, involving nearly 5,000 Nato soldiers, over half British, was superbly executed \u2013 with no coalition casualties \u2013 and the new generator will bring great benefit to the people of northern Helmand.</p> <p>But for the US critics this isn't enough \u2013 the Brits and the other Europeans, say the Americans, should be trashing the poppy fields, cowing the population, beating up the Taliban and doing the often murky business of Hamid Karzai's family and pals. </p> <p>Britain will leave Iraq next year with little sense of accomplishment \u2013 some 176 dead, thousands injured and a military expenditure approaching \u00a310bn \u2013 and with very little credit and gratitude from the government in Baghdad and the principal ally, the US. \"Without adequate troops to protect the population, security in Basra deteriorated, the British withdrew and Shiite militias took control,\" was the pithy summation by John Nagl, brightest of American military thinkers, only last Friday. It took the US military and Iraqi army to get control of the city, he correctly states.</p> <p>In security at home and abroad George W Bush, Dick Cheney, Rumsfeld, Gonzales, Rove et al invoked a doctrine of exceptionalism, and executive dominance. If things continue in the same manner \u2013 and I think they will, whoever becomes the 44th president of the United States, we the allies must invoke our own exceptionalism to America's loonier foreign adventures and military demands. </p> <p>Bill Clinton's advice to Tony Blair that the best way to handle the newly elected George W Bush to \"hug him close\", must have been among the worst ever given to a British prime minister. Even an old shrewdy like William Jefferson Clinton could not have known that our Tony would take him literally and unswervingly at his word. </p> <p>If only he had taken to heart that other of the WJ Clinton bonnes pens\u00e9es, his rueful reflection, reference Monica Lewinsky, on the folly of inappropriate relationships.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/britishamericantobacco\">British American Tobacco</a> has become the latest UK company to face the threat of legal action in Russia, after being targeted by the country's consumer rights agency, Rospotrebnadzor.</p> <p>Gennady Onishchenko, director of Rospotrebnadzor, said this afternoon that he had signed a lawsuit against BAT for \"misleading consumers\" and infringing their rights, although he would not give any more details about the nature of the claim.</p> <p>Back in July Onishchenko launched a ferocious attack on global tobacco companies, threatening them with legal action for \"nicotine genocide\" for allegedly making huge profits at the expense of Russians' health. Today he reitereated those claims, saying the tobacco producers viewed Russia as \"an uncivilized market where they can sell dangerous and poisonous products\". </p> <p>He also accused the companies of lobbying \"barbaric norms for the amount of tar and nicotine in tobacco products\".</p> <p>BAT in London declined to comment on the attacks from Rospotrebnadzor but Alexander Lyuty, corporate and regulatory affairs director at BAT Russia, said the company have not received any official claim and, therefore, was \"not aware of its grounds in detail\". Lyuty said his company was acting \"in full accordance with Russian legislation\".</p> <p>The details of the claim remain unclear, but market watchers say the suit will likely focus on \"light\" and \"superlight\" labeling on cigarette packs.</p> <p>Rospotrebnadzor considers them misleading as consumers get the impression that light cigarettes are \"better for your health, which they are not\", Dmitry Yanin, chairman of the Consumer Societies Confederation, a non-profit group in Moscow, said after Onishchenko's July attack on the global companies.</p> <p><strong>Warnings get bigger</strong></p> <p>The Kremlin has also acknowledged that the country must do more to combat smoking. Russian has recently ratified the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which mandates a series of measures against smoking within five years, including higher prices for cigarettes.</p> <p>Russian health authorities have been pushing for curbs on tobacco producers. Health warnings on cigarette packs in Russia have been growing bigger in the past few years.</p> <p>Maxim Kulkov, head of commercial practice at Moscow-based law firm, Pepeliaev, Goltsblat and Partners, said he does not see any wrongdoing on the companies' part that could substantiate Rospotrebnadzor's claim of misleading information.</p> <p>\"The amount of nicotine is indicated on each pack,\" he said. \"The only thing they say is that the cigarettes contain less nicotine and taste lighter.\"</p> <p>Kulkov said it was unlikely the case would lead to a slew of claims, similar to the recent tobacco trials in the United States. \"Unlike in the US, in Russia it is impossible to commence a class action, a lawsuit filed on behalf of a large group of people, such as smokers,\" he said.</p> <p>The US stipulation of treble damage does not apply in Russia, which means that claimants cannot seek millions in damages, as is the case in the US.</p> <p>\"Neither BAT nor any other company on the market has broken any laws,\" said Vadim Zhelnin, director general at Tabakprom, a Russian association of tobacco producers. \"The 'light' labeling is not banned in this country.\"</p> <p>BAT has been a keen purchaser of local tobacco companies but the UK group has also found Russia a growing market for its top brands such as Dunhill.</p> <p>The regulatory broadside follows similar attacks on other Western companies in the oil and mining sectors by environmental and financial watchdogs which have usually been interpreted by analysts as attempts by the Kremlin to crackdown on the activities of foreign firms.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/05/bp.oilandgascompanies\">BP agreed to make wholesale changes to the management structure of its TNK-BP joint venture</a> - including the removal of its chief executive, Robert Dudley, a former BP man. Shell handed over a large share of its Sakhalin gas field business to state-owned Gazprom after being faced with destabalising criticism from a number of Russian regulators.</p> <p>The relationship between the Russian state and Western investors has also been soured by Kremlin support for military intervention in Georgia. British-Russian relations are also going through a particularly rocky period following the assassination in London of former KGB officer, Alexander Litvinenko.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday September 10 2008.

  "<p>David King's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7603257.stm\">suggestion</a> that we should cut back on space research and basic physics in order to focus on more immediate issues is misguided. Of course, the scientific community should work as hard as possible to address major issues that affect our everyday lives such as climate change, infectious diseases and counterterrorism; in particular, \"clean energy\" research deserves far higher priority. And science and technology are the prime routes to tackling these issues. </p> <p>But it is mistaken to claim that global problems will be solved more quickly if only researchers would abandon their quest to understand the universe and knuckle down to work on an agenda of public or political concerns. These are not \"either/or\" options \u2013 indeed, there is a positive symbiosis between them.</p> <p>We need basic, fundamental research for a whole raft of reasons. It is the bedrock on which technology is based. But its applications can't be foreseen, even by the pioneers who open up new fields \u2013 not even by people of the calibre of great pioneers like Faraday or Rutherford. We are greatly aided in quantifying the problem of climate change because, 200 years ago, scientists thought it would be interesting to start collecting data on temperature and see how it changed between years. The Royal Society published some of the results and, at first glance, they are among the most useless scientific papers ever published. But without them, our understanding of global warming would be much less. The 19th-century version of David King's argument would have stopped this work to concentrate exclusively on how to make better sailing ships. (And let's not forget the role of space technology, much of it pioneered in our research universities, in providing key modern evidence on global climate and environment.)</p> <p>Also, it is, crucially, the big scientific issues that attract the best people into science \u2013 even though they end up in varied careers. David King is right that environmental issues are noble challenges, that they deserve higher priority, and that we need urgently to address global warming through science. But a prerequisite for this is an enthusiastic and inspired generation of talented scientists. And it's well documented that many are attracted by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/sep/06/1\">space physics and particle physics</a>. Telling young people that many of the most interesting bits of research are off-limits \u2013 and that they would need to go abroad to pursue them \u2013 would be an \"own goal\". It would send a negative signal to all aspiring scientists.</p> <p>High-profile, world-leading discoveries make us feel good about ourselves and boosts interest in research, just as winning armfuls of Olympic medals in Beijing boosted national morale. Given the scale of issues like global warming and epidemic disease, we shouldn't underestimate the importance of a can-do attitude to science rather than a can't-afford-it attitude. Just as the Apollo programme was an overall boost to the US in the 1960s, it's in our interests today \u2013 and the world's \u2013 for the UK to raise the profile and priority of science and technology across the broadest possible front.</p>",

  "<p>Controversial surgery for treating obesity that involves reducing the patient's stomach to the size of a thumb should be made more widely available on the NHS, according to obesity researchers. They say a lack of resources and prejudice from some doctors is preventing many morbidly obese patients from receiving life-saving surgery.</p> <p>Dr Carel Le Roux at Imperial College London and his colleague Dr Rachel Batterham are calling for 10 times the number of operations currently performed. At present around 6,000 people receive the surgery each year but guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/CG43\">National Institute of Clinical Excellence</a> say the number should be 60,000.<br> Currently, only patients with a <a href=\"http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/\">body mass index</a> of 35 or over are eligible, but the scientists say more research is needed to work out whether this criterion should be extended. A BMI of 25 or higher is considered overweight. Thirty or more is considered obese. \"We are shooting way low at the moment,\" Le Roux said. \"We actually don't have the infrastructure to look after these patients.\"</p> <p>\"What we need to know is which patients would benefit from this operation and I think that evidence is lacking,\" Le Roux told the British Association's Festival of Science in Liverpool. Around two-thirds of the UK population is overweight or obese and the World Health Organisation predicts that by 2015 2.3 billion adults worldwide will be overweight and 700 million will be obese.</p> <p>Gastric bypass surgery involves closing off part of the stomach to dramatically reduce its size and replumbing the new smaller stomach into a point further down the small intestine. Traditionally, this was seen as a crude way to reduce the ability of the patient's gut to absorb energy from food. \"Physicians had thought this was bad news for a long time,\" Le Roux said.</p> <p>But he said more recent research has found that the surgery leads to subtle long-term changes in the levels of hormones that determine how hungry and full the patient feels. \"Until that point, people actually thought these operations worked through mechanical means \u2026 and that's what patients have been told,\" Le Roux said. In many cases the surgery also cures type 2 diabetes.<br> In the long term Le Roux and Batterham hope to recreate these changes using drugs without surgery, but in the meantime they say the \u00a39,000 operation can make a huge difference to patients. It typically leads to a 25% weight reduction in the long term.<br>\"The holy grail of understanding how this works is that it will potentially lead to a cure for obesity and type 2 diabetes,\" said Batterham, who works at the centre for diabetes and endocrinology at University College London. </p> <p>She said that there is a great deal of prejudice against obese people, and solving their condition is not as simple as merely eating less and exercising more.</p> <p>\"The systems that control our weight evolved in a totally different environment,\" Batterham said. \"In the past, being able to store excess calories and being able to use that energy was actually a survival advantage.\"</p> <p>She said some people are genetically predisposed to becoming obese and once they become overweight, changes in their hormone levels mean it becomes almost impossible for them to lose weight. \"As soon as you start to diet the body thinks you are starving even though you have got lots of fat stored. What it does in response to that is it changes these gut hormones to make you feel even more hungry,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Arriving at UC Berkeley's campus on my first day of my year abroad, I could not have felt further away from home. The sprawling grounds, freshly painted white buildings and sun-speckled green gardens were a far cry from Edinburgh's grey, 1960s tower blocks that characterise its George Square campus. </p> <p>Upon entering the regal gate that marked the start of university grounds, I was engulfed in a sea of tables, placards and banners, as well as deafening cries of \"Join our club\", \"Attend our conference\" and \"You can save the world\". </p> <p>As I fought through the throng of student societies, clubs and activists that used this area as a daily meeting ground, I noticed an unusual thing: not only were students up and awake before the usual midday start that I had been used to in Edinburgh, but their enthusiasm and energy was contagious. </p> <p>As an English literature student at the University of Edinburgh, I had been lucky enough to take up two additional subjects in my first two years. That, for me, was the real draw of the Scottish education system, which offers more breadth than its English counterpart. While I had to choose my degree at the age of 17, I had been able to speak Spanish and discuss philosophy, while reading Chaucer and Shakespeare at university. </p> <p>However, this freedom was limited to certain courses, and classes in the science department were strictly off limits for a literature major. Conversely, American students call university, \"school\", and have to take a wide variety of subjects in a range of departments before they are allowed to graduate. </p> <p>As a student who loves literature, but sees little connection between my degree and a practical job, this freedom was unbelievably exciting. As Americans literally shopped for courses, from peace and conflict studies to astronomy and Asian studies, I found a passion amongst students that I felt had been somewhat lacking in my third year contemporaries in Edinburgh. </p> <p>The ability to choose the layout of your course means that degrees become personalised and very few students graduate with the same class history. This create-your-own-major model will certainly not suit every student, and I did have international friends, for whom this was a point of contention. </p> <p>Certain classes at UC Berkeley were not as detailed or challenging as many of the ones I took in Edinburgh, and professors were prone to spoon-feeding students in a manner that could occasionally seem condescending. Emphasis is certainly on opinion and self-expression and historical or critical theory is often actively discouraged. Due to the size of the student body, smaller tutorial classes were something of a luxury, but there was something about being taught modern poetry by a Pulitzer Prize winning Beat poet that made sure even the most cynical of students turned up to class. </p> <p>When discussing the American university system, there is, of course, the question of finance to consider. For an international student to study full-time at UC Berkeley, the costs can be staggering and make top-up fees pale in comparison. While Californian students have to pay less than an out-of-state applicant, the fees are still considerable for the majority of UC Berkeley's community. </p> <p>However, during my year abroad, I met very few students who took their education for granted, something which cannot always be said of my experience at Edinburgh. The majority of students at UC Berkeley take a full course load, run extra-curricular clubs and work to fund their education. This does leave less time for daytime TV, pub visits and the general \"relaxation\" time that characterises much of British university culture, but surprisingly, I did not miss it. Attending lectures, doing homework and being continuously assessed might seem daunting to the British student, but I found that once more was expected of me, I actually wanted to do more. </p> <p>Now I am back on British soil, I am often asked if in hindsight, I would choose to spend my entire university experience at an American university. My answer: it depends on what university and where. Just as British universities differ considerably from place to place, I realise that UC Berkeley was unique. But, despite this realisation, I do believe that the American and British attitudes to university are strikingly different. </p> <p>While British universities offer a challenging environment for students who are inherently driven, they can make it very easy for others to sit back, relax and leave hard work until later. This mentality is just not acceptable in most American universities and certain British students might just benefit from giving this alternative approach to education a try.</p>",
  "<p>For decades, Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn was one of New York's great tourist attractions. At the height of its popularity during the 1800s, half a million people visited annually to picnic among its manicured grounds. A letter in Green-Wood's archives from a 19th-century Englishwoman recounts how she would love to visit America one day \"to see Niagara Falls and Green-Wood Cemetery\". </p> <p>If the meandering paths and genteel lawns of Central Park represent New York's romantic side, then the hulking mausoleums and Gothic stonework of Green-Wood capture Gotham in all its brooding glory. But the cemetery slipped into obscurity in the 1970s after its trustees decided they could no longer afford to keep the grounds open to visitors. They reversed that decision in the 1980s, yet it has remained one of the city's hidden treasures: a delight for historians and bird watchers, but rarely visited by the majority of New Yorkers. </p> <p>It's a pity because, if anything, Green-Wood Cemetery is even more fascinating today. Its collection of famous graves, including Henry Steinway, Samuel Morse, and the Tiffany family, has increased in recent decades to include artist Jean Michel Basquiat and composer/conductor Leonard Bernstein. Meanwhile, its importance as a civil war resting ground has grown following the discovery of hundreds of hitherto unmarked Union and Confederate graves.</p> <p>But the primary reason for visiting Green-Wood remains unchanged \u2014 almost 500 acres of stunning, tree-lined hills and valleys, carved by a glacier that slipped into New York harbour about 17,000 years ago. </p> <p>Even the entrance to Green-Wood is spectacular, framed by three 100ft Gothic Revival arches. Today, they are home to a squawking colony of bright green monk parakeets which, according to local folklore, escaped from a crate at JFK in the 1960s and have lived at Green-Wood ever since. </p> <p>Passing beneath the arches, most visitors head for Battle Hill, one of the highest points in Brooklyn. From the top, a bronze statue of the goddess of battle, Minerva, looks out towards New York harbor, raising her arm in greeting towards the Statue of Liberty. Liberty, of course, is waving back. <br> One of the most spectacular memorials is an elegant, Victorian monument to Charlotte Canda, who died in a horse-drawn carriage accident on her 17th birthday. To commemorate her tender age, her father ordered the elaborate memorial to measure 17 feet wide and 17 feet tall, and to be decorated with a shield bearing 17 roses.</p> <p>But, with burial space now running short, Green-Wood's trustees are looking increasingly towards catering for the living to guarantee the cemetery's future.</p> <p>Nowadays, the chapel is just as likely to host weddings, concerts and theatre productions as funeral services. Meanwhile, the cemetery runs dozens of events a year commemorating the lives of its authors, artists, musicians and soldiers. Kids particularly enjoy the flash-lit Halloween walks.</p> <p>In the past five years visitor numbers have almost doubled, from 140,000 in 2002 to 270,000 in 2007. It's still a far cry from the half a million visitors of 150 years ago. But if numbers continue to grow at this rate, Green-Wood may once again become one of New York's premier tourist attractions. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.green-wood.com\">Green-Wood Cemetery</a> is open daily from 8am until 4pm. Entrance is free. The cemetery occasionally runs guided tours.

  "<p><br>Trendy Italian house duo Crookers ... their remix of Day and Night is an unexpected party anthem. Photograph: PR</p> <p>If you're looking for a quaint, relaxing break in a setting steeped in culture, then the holiday resort of Malia in Crete is probably not for you. If, on the other hand, you're after downing three pints of Sambuca a night, before stripping off and chasing a terrified hotel porter and picking up a veritable cornucopia of STDs, it's definitely the place to go. Better still, you'll get to hear one of this year's most unexpected party anthems. </p> <p>Along with Ayia Napa in Cyprus, Malia has established itself as one of the mainstays of DJs, MCs and fans from the UK garage scene (and its many offshoots) each summer. Last year, it was Leeds producer T2's bassline track <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTsHWzvJWDQ\">Heartbroken</a> that gained popularity with young holidaymakers on these islands. Then, after they returned to the UK, their desire to own the song that had soundtracked a summer sent Heartbroken to No 2 in the charts and kickstarted the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassline_house\">bassline scene</a>.</p> <p>This year, tunes like the Crazy Cousinz's funky remix of Paleface and Kyla's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GJ3oxSTUNw\">Do You Mind</a> have been going down well with the holidaying Brits, but there is one song in particular that seems to be getting a lot of people excited in Malia. Unexpectedly, the remix by trendy Italian house duo Crookers of American rapper Kid Cudi's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5qcccB5-JM\">Day and Night</a> has been a massive hit in Crete and nearby destinations like the Greek island of Kos. Owing to its summer success, the song, which was originally signed to small independent American label Fool's Gold, has now been picked up by a major for release in the UK and Europe later this year.</p> <p>It's currently one of the most requested songs on digital urban radio station 1Xtra, and if you peruse the comments beneath videos of the song on YouTube, you will find an outpouring of holiday memories evoked by the track. Hundreds of people have left comments like: \"malia 08 u wot u wot\" and \"Kos 08 babyyyyyyyyyyyyy\", to the utter confusion of long-term Crookers fans who occasionally reply with something along the lines of: Can someone please tell me what Malia is?</p> <p>Crookers are part of a crop of international producers who have been tied in with the often frowned-upon genre <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidget_house\">fidget house</a> - a joke term made up a few years ago by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_(DJ/Producer)\">Switch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/jesseroseandcontent\">Jesse Rose</a>. It's a scene that doesn't really exist beyond the internet, and the term seems to be used so that bloggers know what to put in the genre field in iTunes before uploading songs.</p> <p>Switch is recognised as the first producer to begin making fidget and his Dubsided label has been central in releasing the scene's music. His productions are subtle, but subsequent producers, such as Trevor Loveys, Herve, Fake Blood and Jack Beats, have exaggerated the initial elements of fidget.</p> <p>The sound is defined by snatched vocal snippets, pitch-bent basslines and rave-style synth stabs over glitchy 4/4 beats. Fidget producers like to think of themselves as global music connoisseurs, hand-picking bits from genres such as Chicago house, rave, UK garage, US hip-hop, Baltimore club, Kuduro and other \"authentic\" world music genres. In reality, at its worst, the genre is basically an updated, ever-so-slightly less cheesy take on big beat - with its annoying rap vocal loops and ridiculous Fatboy Slim-style builds. The more annoying songs sound like the theme to Fun House if there were a new series. And if I hadn't have had the misfortune of seeing Pat Sharpe play records at my friend's Christmas party last year, I would be convinced that this is the kind of music he plays at his DJ gigs. (If you were wondering, he played stuff like Urban Cookie Collective's The Key, The Secret, No Limit by 2 Unlimited, and a Fun House mega mix, while repeatedly shouting, \"Scream if you wanna go faster\".)</p> <p>It's not all bad though. The Crookers remix of Day and Night is a genuinely great club song, and its popularity is rightly deserved. What I find slightly ironic, though, is that it's essentially an appropriated bassline song made to appeal to people outside this scene. But it seems to be the bassline and UK garage fans that have latched on to it the most. Crookers have done such a good job at \"pinching\" the best bits from bassline that they've managed to win over many of the scene's fans.</p>",

Photograph: RSPB</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RSPB</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You may have noticed that oven-ready partridges have appeared in some shops just this weekend.</p> <p>The legal game seasons for England, Scotland and Wales allow the shooting of pheasant from October 1 to February 1, and partridge from September 1 to February 1. So you may have wondered how, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/sep/02/foodanddrink\">as reported by Jay Rayner</a>, Grosvenor House managed to serve roast partridge with wild mushrooms to the hundreds of people at the London Restaurant Awards on September 1 (not to me, guv, I wasn't invited).</p> <p>Our own supper on September 1 made me particularly alert to this mighty feat of logistics. It was my wife's formidable game pie, made from a brace each of partridge and pheasant, as we were \u2013 erm \u2013 clearing out the freezer to get ready for this year's game birds. She took advantage of a phone call from Raymond Blanc to ask him what sort of pastry to use. He said short crust, and gave her a terrific tip: cool down the filling in the freezer before putting on the pastry lid, as otherwise steam from the hot filling will make the pastry soggy. He was right on both counts.</p> <p>We live near several big shoots, which means the local shops are full of pheasant and partridge in season, and they're cheaper than chicken. Indeed, the bags are so big that sometimes they can't sell the birds and \u2013 shamefully \u2013 bury them.</p> <p>Personally, I prefer game birds to most other protein. First, because they are generally (and don't bother to write in with the exceptions, I know them all) reared naturally, with minimal chemical and pharmaceutical inputs; and second, they have a decent life before being shot - yes, I know they're nearly tame, that's one of the reasons why beaters have to be employed (I'm not bothered that they're shot for the amusement of human beings, so please don't trouble yourself to write about that, either.)</p> <p>But most important of all, they taste good. I'm not fond of game that has hung to the point of decay, though Grosvenor House-style same-day consumption is only palatable for grouse. I've twice had same-day grouse, once in Scotland, and then the other day \u2013 I think \u2013 at Quo Vadis in London. Both times the bird, though served a little too rare, actually tasted of heather.</p> <p>Grouse, however, is wildly expensive. Even this year when there are said to be good supplies, the cheapest I've heard of is \u00a39 a bird. I've just bought half a dozen wood pigeons from our butcher, and they were not cheap at \u00a31.99 each.</p> <p>At the peak of their seasons last year, though, partridges were about \u00a32 and pheasants about \u00a32.50 each, whereas a virtuously reared chicken cost a good deal more per serving.</p> <p>So why eat anything else? Do you agree? And how do you feel about hanging? Game, not people \u2013 though in American vice-presidential mooseburger-land I believe they favour both.</p>",
  "<p><br>Kilt-edged television ... Gregor Fisher as Rab C Nesbitt. Photograph: Murdo Macleod</p> <p>So the long-awaited <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/08/television.scotland\">Scottish Broadcasting Commission report</a>, instigated by the SNP, is likely to recommend the setting up of a new digital channel made up of \"distinctively Scottish\" programming for Scottish viewers. Well knock me down with a flyaway sporran, who'da thunk it? Scottish Nationalist Alex Salmond and commission chairman, the (Scottish) former BBC News boss Blair Jenkins, want an independent Scottish TV station. With a free tartan blanket, whisky hipflask and 50 foot \"peace wall\" just north of Hadrian's effort thrown in for good measure we can presume.</p> <p>First Minister Salmond set up the commission last year to consider the future of the TV industry, \"taking account of the economic, cultural and democratic importance of broadcasting to a modern, outward-looking Scotland and its creative industries\". The SNP have always been quick to point out any perceived shortfall in British TV's Scottish programming, arguing in particular that the BBC represents too many news events from an English perspective and that major national networks seem unwilling to support production houses north of the border. Salmond's party even convinced the BBC to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/may/27/broadcasting.bbc\">re-tilt their high-tech weather map</a> in 2005 after complaining that the aerial view shrunk Scotland out of proportion.</p> <p>Salmond is probably right that London-based TV companies and corporations aren't interested in paying more than lip service to what they see as chippy Scottish viewers, but the suggestion that Scotland hosts its own digital station, funded on a not-for-profit basis by the UK government, sends shivers down my spine. Tuning into a channel made by, for and about a mere five million people is the cultural equivalent of closing the curtains, locking the door and curling up with a duvet over your head.</p> <p>With a small pool of talent to choose from and an equally limited budget, the vision for this channel exposes all that is small-minded and parochial about the SNP mentality. \"As long as it's Scottish, even if its total crap,\" seems to be the motto. Are there really Scots who would rather watch cheap, badly acted soaps with quivering sets (BBC Scotland's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/tv/rivercity/\">River City</a>) instead of Coronation Street; who are more interested in a new giraffe at Edinburgh Zoo than in terrorist attacks in London? If there are, it is unlikely that they are the dynamic, switched on people Scottish culture needs to compete with the rest of the world.</p> <p>There is a lot of writing and production talent in Scotland, especially in the areas of drama, comedy, news and sport, and the best way for it to flourish is in the context of a competitive British environment where it will be rewarded with decent money, a wider on-air talent pool and a big, diverse audience. A Scottish-only channel would need to give airtime to any idiot in a kilt who had learned to use a camera in order to fill up its transmission hours. Anyone who can hold their own with the big boys - <a href=\"http://www.frankieboyle.com/\">Frankie Boyle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/may/11/news.newmedia\">Andrew Marr</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/apr/13/television.bbc\">Kirsty Wark</a>, or the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/tv/chewinthefat/jack_and_victor/still_game/\">Still Game guys</a> - will always be snapped up by national networks, which would leave the Scottish channel bunged up with woeful amateurs. As an advert for Scottish talent it would be a national embarrassment. With world-beaters like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/08/usopentennis.andymurray1\">Andy Murray</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/glasvegas\">Glasvegas</a> in our corner, Scotland should be looking upwards and outwards, not down at our navels.</p>",
  "<p>As Mayorwatch <a href=\"http://www.mayorwatch.co.uk/johnson-announces-business-advisory-council-members/20084420\">reports</a>, Boris Johnson yesterday <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=18698\">announced</a> the establishment of an International Business Advisory Council for London, chaired by Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the advertising and marketing group <a href=\"http://www.wpp.com/wpp/\">WPP</a>. Mayorwatch also reported that in January, Ken Livingstone had announced the formation of the International Council of Business Advisers to be chaired by, ah, Sir Martin Sorrell. </p> <p>Naturally, we should all rejoice in Sir Martin having the opportunity to be \"delighted\" to be invited to be helpful to London's mayor twice in the same year. But what will be the difference between Mayor Johnson's International Business Advisory Council and Mayor Livingstone's International Council of Business Advisers? Mayorwatch asked the Mayor's office. It provided a statement, which said that Mayor Johnson and Sir Martin, \"have agreed the focus will be broader, on maintaining London's status as a top world city.\"<br> What does this mean? Close textual analysis of the press releases recording Sir Martin's separate expressions of delight suggest either that Johnson's version of the Council will be less concerned with maximising business opportunities in the run up to the 2012 Olympics than was Livingstone's, or every bit as concerned but concerned with some other things as well (not to be facetious, or anything).</p> <p>Either way, I'm interpreting this as just a small further example of Mayor Johnson coming to an accommodation with certain characteristics of his predecessor's regime. A larger example is the apparent reconfiguration of Johnson's administrative and power structure into something far more similar to Livingstone's than advertised. In his Evening Standard <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23552038-details/Yes%2C+I'm+Boris's+chief+enforcer+\u2013+the+supertanker+is+now+turning/article.do\">interview</a> Sir Simon Milton, new effective chief of staff, puts the shock departure of erstwhile chief executive Tim Parker down to this:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The banal truth is that Boris wanted to seize more of the reins of the organization and Tim said: \"But I thought that's what I was here to do\", and they couldn't both do it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Banal? Johnson has inserted himself into the chair of the Transport for London board instead of Parker, a position formerly occupied by Livingstone. He's already committed to occupying the biggest seat on the Metropolitan Police Authority from next month, something Livingstone never did. At this rate, the theoretically hands-off Mayor Johnson is going to have both hands full of every big lever of power in town.</p> <p>The prospect will fill some Londoners with horror: Boris Johnson becoming mayor was one thing; his acting like one would be something else. But for one of his more committed media supporters, the problem seems to be that Johnson shows signs of going native. Though supporting Johnson's public transport fares increases, Standard columnist Andrew Gilligan today <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23552260-details/It's+time+to+turn+your+attention+to+TfL%2C+Boris/article.do\">attacks</a> Johnson's apparent contentment with TfL commissioner Peter Hendy remaining in post, his recruitment of TfL's policy director Isabel Dedring as his environment adviser and his general failure for far to lay waste to the TfL workforce. </p> <p>Insubordinate, that Boris. I'm starting to grow rather fond of him.</p>",
  "<p> 'Nothing went right all day' ... a farmer inspects his waterlogged crop. Photograph: Ian Hodgson/Reuters</p> <p>In Irish mythology, mist is often associated with transformation. In the legend, Lir's Children, for example, Aoife creates clouds of steam in which to accomplish the curse that changes the children into swans. Their release from the curse and return to human form, 900 years later, takes place under cover of a great white mist shot through with rainbow colours.</p> <p>The \"strange bright mist\" in the second stanza of Bernard O'Donoghue's poem \"Ceo Draiochta (Magic Mist)\" may bring the legend to mind, especially as one of the central players, the most fatalistic and perhaps irresponsible, is named Leary.</p> <p>While the poem is a solidly realistic account of a threshing accident, with un-magically sodden autumn weather producing the conditions that invite disaster, the narrator gives the impression that a little extra ingredient of bad luck might be at work. \"Curse\" would be too strong a word. But the weather, it seems, has been persistently frustrating, and this particular day, when the threshing can no longer be postponed, we sense that the antagonism between nature and man will be brought to a crisis.</p> <p>The reader need not know anything about threshing machinery to get a rough feel for its operation and the different kinds of mechanical movement and human activity entailed. The quality of physical presence in the poem recalls the work of Patrick Kavanagh.</p> <p>O'Donoghue, too, is master of the poetic art of heavy word-lifting. His diction is simple and forceful. The narrative rhythm works cleverly with, and against, the line. In stanza two the effect is mimetic: the flow of the lines is checked by caesurae, just as the machine is hampered by various minor accidents like the \"skidding\" of the errant sheaves. The lightness of the phrase \"the zipping drum\" comes up against the consonantal sluggishness of words like \"choked\", \"growled\", \"shouldered\".</p> <p>Cunning poetic camera-work often directs us revealingly to the sidelines where significant details, such as those slippery orange boards, are shot in close-up. By now, the reader's heart rate has increased. Suspense is not such a frequent experience in poetry as in fiction, but O'Donoghue always knows how to plot-thicken the lyric and make it tell a compelling story. What is admirable here is the slow build-up of tension, and the fine balance struck between the two narrative poles: the demand for predictability and the demand for resisting the predictable.</p> <p>We know disaster will strike from the moment the narrator says \"Nothing went right all day.\" When it does, it is presented obliquely: the horror is registered, then the poem moves on, as life does, and the consequences are unexpectedly less than tragic. We hear rather than see the accident (the machine itself providing some of the soundtrack). We learn that the narrator himself wasn't present: he was one of \"those of us in school\". It is \"Our Tim\", not the narrator, who describes with awful brevity what has happened to Matt Bridgie, hiding his eyes as he speaks. But we do not meet Matt Bridgie until the last stanza.</p> <p>And then it's as if the mist had magically withdrawn. The narrative speeds up, with a lot of time passing in just a few lines. Matt's compensation is not merely, or mainly, financial: he is \"released\" into the discovery of his talent for verse and song, reminding us that Lir's children had a special gift for singing. We might also note in passing that the legend is sometimes read as a parable of Irish national emergence.</p> <p>Of course, the poem stands fully achieved as it is: a beautifully constructed and satisfying narrative, with a little rainbow-y flicker of myth at the edges. If it's a parable, perhaps it's simply one about the power of ordinary people to transcend themselves and their environment, to be kind and to find hope in the most unlikely circumstances.</p> <p><strong>Ceo Draiochta (Magic Mist)*</strong></p> <p>Leary sniffed the sweating wheat <br>Which had been heaped in the rick <br>That heavy autumn, reluctant <br>To dirty the machine with it. <br>But thirty men were gathered in the yard <br>And two fences had been levelled <br>For the thresher's awkward entry, <br>So finally he shrugged <br>And withdrew to the kitchen.</p> <p>Nothing went right all day. Twice <br>The zipping drum was choked by sheaves <br>That skidded from their tyings <br>So the engine growled to a halt. <br>The home farmer, hurrying, <br>Shouldered the drive belt off <br>With his sack. And all through the day <br>The strange bright mist that the sun <br>Could not break through got heavier</p> <p>And the gloss-painted orange boards <br>Got slippier. They were nearly finished, <br>The best made of a bad job, when Leary <br>Who'd been dozing by the fire until <br>He'd be called to end the operation, <br>Leapt to his feet, hearing two things: <br>The machine's bellow rapidly sinking <br>And a scream that those of us in school <br>That famous day heard from two miles away.</p> <p>They ran in all directions. <br>John Tim Jack, seventeen stone, <br>Cleared two walls on his way home. <br>Our Tim crashed through the front door <br>And hid his face in his chaff-pierced sleeve <br>Crying, 'Matt Bridgie slipped into the drum. <br>His leg was taken off from the knee down.'</p> <p>That was it really. A man passing <br>From town tied a belt around the leg <br>And administered a cigarette. <br>Pieces of rubber from the wellington <br>And clots of sock were scraped <br>From the hopper. Ultimately <br>Some compensation was paid, enough <br>For a rudimentary false leg <br>And a few rounds of drinks. <br>Matt showed signs of a latent <br>Family talent for composing verse, <br>And often sang well past closing time.</p> <p>\u00b7 Author's Note: In the title \"ceo\" is \"fog\" and \"draiochta\" is \"of magic\" ... the first element in the magic word, \"draoi-\", is the word usually translated as \"druid\".</p> <p>\u00b7 \"Ceo Draiochta (Magic Mist)\" originally appeared in the Whitbread-Award-winning 1995 collection, Gunpowder.

  "<p>After eight years of inaction, carbon emissions policy may finally take a reality-based turn. Both Republican senator John McCain and Democratic senator Barack Obama have proposed \"cap-and-trade\" (CAT) plans. While McCain's running mate, Alaska governor Sarah Palin, recently declared she <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/headlines/sarah_palin_vp/2008/08/29/126139.html\">doesn't believe climate change is \"man-made\"</a>, I'll assume that McCain continues to support his plan.</p> <p>There are two key differences between the candidates' plans. First, by 2050, Obama would <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/newenergy\">reduce emissions by 80%</a> of 1990 levels. McCain <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/informing/issues/65bd0fbe-737b-4851-a7e7-d9a37cb278db.htm\">stops at 60%</a>. Second, Obama would use a market-based auction to allocate permits that power CAT policy, while McCain would simply give them to polluters, providing huge annual handouts to a favoured few at everyone else's expense. Let's see why.</p> <p>When you burn fossil fuels, emitted carbon harms the environment for everyone around you. Because you don't bear the costs you impose on others, they're \"external\", and this is known as a negative externality. Economists have known for eons that with negative externalities, leaving a market alone - \"free-market\" policy - causes inefficiency in the form of too much pollution. The only way to avoid this outcome is some sort of government intervention. Period.</p> <p>Under old-style \"command-and-control\" regulations, the government told polluters how much to emit, and that was that. Pollution stays below the desired level, but this policy is inefficient, since some companies can reduce their carbon footprints more cheaply than others, and all that matters is the total amount emitted. An alternative policy doesn't restrict emissions, but imposes a per-pound tax on emitted carbon. Producers that can reduce emissions for less than the tax will do so, while others will produce carbon and pay the tax. In principle, the tax can be set to achieve any desired level of emissions reduction. </p> <p>But the government might screw up. Too high a tax brings unnecessarily high reductions in economic production. Given today's tax-phobic political climate, it's more likely that the government would set the tax too low, with disastrous climatic results.</p> <p>Enter cap-and-trade. Government chooses the total quantity of carbon emissions (cap) and issues permits that companies can buy and sell (trade). Once permits are allocated, supply and demand determine the price of a permit, which acts just like a carbon tax: companies that can reduce emissions cheaply will sell permits and reduce emissions, while companies on the opposite side of the ledger will buy permits and keep emitting carbon. The lower the cap, the higher the price. CAT provides the benefits of both command-and-control and taxes: emissions won't top the cap, and the \"right\" companies will do the reduction.</p> <p>Research suggests those permits will be worth real money - perhaps as much as $<a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2008/08/obama-energy-pl.html\">50-$300bn per year by 2020</a>. That's enough money to pay for an awful lot of campaign promises.</p> <p>Obama would <a href=\"http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/05/the_case_for_auctions.php\">auction off the permits</a>, using the proceeds for taxpayer rebates and investments in green energy sources to help offset CAT-induced increases in production costs, which themselves will lead to reduced employment and higher prices. Basic fairness and common sense suggest that whatever pain CAT causes should be salved with shared benefits.</p> <p>By contrast, McCain's plan fails this fairness test. While average taxpayers adjust to higher prices due to higher production costs, McCain would shower <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_05/013715.php\">windfall profits on polluters' shareholders</a>. As noted above, CAT is just like imposing a tax, together with a clever mechanism to ensure the chosen reduction in total emissions. Refusing to auction off the permits, though, is just like letting polluters keep the revenue from a carbon tax. Would anyone support that?</p> <p>Now, it's true that CAT will increase polluters' costs, reducing shareholder value. But we could compensate shareholders with just 15% of the permits' value - a far cry from McCain's 100% gift.</p> <p>Let's leave aside the fact that McCain would reduce emissions by considerably less than Obama. The simple fact is that McCain's plan would provide the mother of all handouts, for no good reason. An annual giveaway of hundreds of billions of dollars to polluters - just because they are polluters - is most certainly not the change anyone should believe in.</p> <p><em>[Note: due to an editing error, the second sentence of the second paragraph previously read \"...reduce emissions to 80% of 1990 levels\". It should have read: \"...reduce emissions <strong>by</strong> 80% of 1990 levels\". Apologies.]</em></p>",
  "<p>More small building societies are likely to be taken over as market conditions continue to put pressure on the sector, commentators said today.</p> <p>This morning the UK's largest society, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/08/creditcrunch.banking\">Nationwide</a>, confirmed it was stepping in to rescue the Cheshire and Derbyshire societies after both ran up big financial losses as a result of the credit crunch and falling UK house prices. </p> <p>Experts said they expected to see similar mergers between small societies and their larger rivals in the coming months.</p> <h2>Credit crunch</h2> <p>Building societies' strategy of funding the bulk of their lending through retail deposits has left them relatively unscathed from the problems in the wholesale money markets, with the sector raising just 30% of its funding in this way.</p> <p>At the same time, their more conservative lending strategies have meant they have far less exposure to higher risk sectors such as sub-prime lending and the buy-to-let market.</p> <p>But they have not been completely immune to the problems caused by the credit crunch.</p> <p>A recent report by KPMG showed that profits across the sector were down 3.5% in the year to the end of April, and this is expected to get worse as a result of rising bad debts and tighter margins.</p> <p>The Financial Services Authority (FSA) is also understood to be keeping a close eye on the mutuals, including enforcing an unwritten rule for building societies to have a minimum 20% liquidity ratio, meaning they have to hold at least \u00a31 in liquid assets for every \u00a35 on deposit.</p> <p>This need to increase liquidity is thought to be partially behind a steep slide in mortgage lending by building societies this year.</p> <p>Net lending, which strips out redemptions and repayments, has been falling steadily from \u00a31.42bn in January to -\u00a3526m in June - meaning consumers repaid more to building societies than the sector lent.</p> <h2>Rising repossessions</h2> <p>There is the concern that small building societies could be worse affected by defaults than their bigger rivals in the banking sector as arrears and repossessions rise, with only a small rise in bad debts having a proportionately greater impact on their liquidity.</p> <p>Steve Williams, head of building societies at business advisory firm Deloitte, said: \"While building societies aren't necessarily looking to merge, the impact of current market circumstances, the inherent difficulties in raising new capital, and the burden and cost of an increasingly complex regulatory environment, all fall disproportionately on smaller institutions.</p> <p>\"Therefore, we should expect to see a few more deals, although it will be a trickle rather than an avalanche.\"</p> <p>Ray Boulger, senior technical manager at mortgage broker John Charcol, agreed that there was likely to be further consolidation in the sector.</p> <p>He said banks and building societies that were able to ride the market during good conditions were struggling to do so during the downturn.</p> <p>\"It is hard to believe there won't be others (merging), although I don't know who,\" he said.</p> <p>He added that Nationwide was likely to play a role in any future consolidation, as it already represented 50% of the sector even before today's merger announcement.</p> <p>Yorkshire Building Society had also recently aggressively repriced its mortgage range, he said, suggesting it was in a strong position, while Britannia could also feature.</p> <p>But he added that building societies were generally in a good position having seen the level of deposits they take in soar by 60% during the first six months of this year, while mortgage lending fell.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Building Societies Association said further mergers would not represent a weakening of the sector.</p> <p>\"The building societies sector is generally quite resilient and has coped well with the credit crunch,\" she said.</p>",

I say to the government it's time to do the right thing and protect the most vulnerable in society.\"</p> <p>Companies paid \u00a31.6bn to shareholders last year, up by a fifth on the previous 12 months, said Unite.</p> <p>The report added that the percentage of profits spent on finding new deposits of fossil fuels had remained flat for years. </p> <p>The government is due to unveil a fuel package to help those hardest hit by rising energy costs later this week, but there is little expectation that the plans will include a levy on energy firms' profits.</p> <p>Derek Simpson, also joint leader of Unite, added: \"Winter is approaching and in the coming months low paid families will be forced to switch their heating off because they won't be able to afford the bill.</p> <p>\"The heartless excuses from the energy companies for not fulfilling their social responsibilities have been swallowed hook, line and sinker by the government. It's time for action because the situation is dire.\"</p> <p>The government's package is expected on Wednesday and is set to include around \u00a31bn towards the cost of insulating the homes of the poorest families.</p>",

  "<p>Coastal lifeboat charity the RNLI is to double the number of boats it uses for inland flood rescues because of the increase in weather episodes like the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/08/flooding.communities&quot;\"> storms in north-east England</a> at the weekend.</p> <p>The RNLI rescued 24 people over the past two days who were stranded in their homes in Morpeth, which is 10 miles inland.</p> <p>Before 2000, the RNLI had no dedicated inland rescue equipment or expertise, and its teams were more used to emergencies at sea. Now it has six boats and a team of 60 people specially trained for floods in Britain and abroad.</p> <p>Today it revealed plans to increase the number of flood rescue boats to 12, two for each for its six regions. Currently all six boats are based in Poole, Dorset.</p> <p>Hugh Fogarty, the RNLI fleet operations director, said: \"With the way weather patterns are changing it is almost certain that we will be doing more inland rescues. It is something we were planning to do anyway but Morpeth obviously increases the urgency. We are now looking to accelerate that programme.\"</p> <p>Fogarty, who is based in Poole, was called by Northumberland fire and police chiefs on Saturday to help with the flood effort. He organised for a lifeboat from Blyth, on the Northumberland coast, to be driven 20 miles to Morpeth. </p> <p>Six other training boats were used in the rescue operation. The RNLI crews carried away 24 stranded people, plus dogs and cats. </p> <p>Forgarty said: \"We are working on the assumption that there will be more calls for us this week.\"</p> <p>He said the RNLI's service on the coast would not be compromised. \"Sailors don't need to be worried that they will be ignored. Primarily we are coastal search and rescue responder. That is still our core business.\"</p> <p>Waveney Crookes, the RNLI's training inspector for the north, who was involved in the Morpeth operation, said: \"The water came up to our chests and fridge-freezers were just floating around. </p> <p>\"We are used to rescuing people at sea and inland flooding offers very different challenges. More and more of our lifeboat crews are now trained in swift water techniques to enable them to respond to inland incidents like this one which, unfortunately, seem to be happening more frequently.\"</p>",
  "<p>Immigration is an emotive issue. The possibilities of a rational debate are constrained as many commentators have already adopted certain positions. The latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/07/immigration.visas\">proposals</a> are to expel non-EU immigrants after four years. The proponents of such policies are happy to collect taxes from non-EU immigrants, but do not wish to extend social rights to them. Yet politicians have shown remarkable unwillingness to address economic causes of legal and illegal immigration.</p> <p>In a world of uneven economic development, many people are persuaded to leave their homes, families and friends in search of greener pastures, especially to the western world. Some immigration is encouraged as often the indigenous population is less willing to accept poorly paid jobs. Immigrants from the Mediterranean countries and Eastern Europe are increasingly providing cheap labour for the leisure, tourism and agriculture industry. Immigration helps to boost the reserve army of labour and enables some employers to make excessive profits by driving down wages and working conditions. Unsurprisingly, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) opposes any <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4474997.stm\">cap</a> and claims that immigration is essential for business<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/migrants-are-essential-for-business-growth-says-cbi-430609.html\"> growth</a>. It is silent on the social rights of immigrants.</p> <p>Immigrants often have dreams, energy and willingness to work long hours. They have revived the British textile industry and run the ubiquitous corner shop. Immigration also results in huge wealth transfer from developing countries to developed countries. The developing countries bear the cost of producing scientists, engineers, doctors and other professionals, but many then migrate to developed countries. </p> <p>The main reason for migration to the western world is that it has comparatively good education, healthcare, economic and social infrastructure. Developing countries, often rich in natural and human resources, can also develop such infrastructure but are hampered by local corruption, export of capital and organised tax avoidance. </p> <p>Due to historical legacies, developing countries are estimated to have an <a href=\"http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/articles.aspx?id=2142\">external debt</a> of some US$2.85 trillion. A large part of this is due to theft by many dictators and deposited in western banks. A report by the UK <a href=\"http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/other_side_of_the_coin_PDF.pdf\">Africa All Party Parliament Group (pdf)</a> noted that \"\u00a3220 bn was stolen or misused by [Nigeria's] past rulers between 1960 and 1999 and much of this was held overseas\". Developing countries paid developed countries more than US$540 billion in <a href=\"http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/articles.aspx?id=2142\">debt service</a> in 2005. Low-income countries continue to pay out $100 million each day to creditors.</p> <p>Developing countries are estimated to be losing an additional $350bn-$500bn a year through organised <a href=\"http://www.eurodad.org/uploadedFiles/Whats_New/Reports/factsheet_capitalflight08.pdf\">tax avoidance (pdf)</a>, often by western multinational corporations. This is more than three times the total of all foreign aid and assistance. <a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk/images/deathandtaxes.pdf\">Christian Aid</a> reported that tax avoidance prevents investment in social infrastructure and will lead to some 5.6m deaths of young children.</p> <p>A recent report by <a href=\"http://www.greenpeac e.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/conning-the-congo.pdf\">Greenpeace</a> noted that logging companies in Congo are avoiding taxes of at least $12m a year. The main tool for this is '<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/06/12\">transfer pricing</a>', a technique used by companies to shift costs and profits. The sums are not trivial by local standards. In terms of 2000 prices, they are over 50 times the country's environmental operating budget. Some $12m is equivalent to 80% of the country's public healthcare budget and could help to vaccinate some 700,000 children under five years of age against deadly diseases.</p> <p>Altogether, developing countries are exporting nearly a trillion dollars each year to developed countries, leaving precious little for investment in education, healthcare, public administration and jobs. Is it any wonder that those who are mobile migrate to developed countries, either legally or illegally? Curbing the export of capital from developing to developed countries and greater investment in local infrastructure will go a long way towards reducing pressures for immigration. Developed countries have been slow to write off debts, or repatriate the funds looted by foreign dictators. They have done nothing to investigate and prosecute companies that avoid taxes in developing countries.</p> <p>While some immigration is a feature of the neoliberal global economy, pressures can be significantly reduced by curbing tax avoidance and creating geopolitical structures that promote more equitable share of wealth and power. Without addressing the economic inequities, there is little prospect of curbing the pressures for legal and illegal immigration.</p>",
  "<p>When S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal was pregnant while holding a position in Mitterrand's government, nobody talked about it, no media reported it in its news pages and Royal did not boast afterwards that she'd worked at her ministry until the moment she set off to the hospital. Even more importantly perhaps, no foreign prime minister issued a statement to deny they were the father. As is today the case with <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4674060.ece\">pregnant French justice minister Rachida Dati</a>.</p> <p>Royal's pregnancy was an entirely private matter, even though she held public office. But this was of course before the Sarkozy era, a new era when some French politicians think of nothing but following in their mentor's footsteps and courting publicity at any cost. Like Berlusconi, Sarkozy craves celebrity. Perhaps he just wants to be recognised, like someone you see in the street, point at and say: \"Oh, it's him, I've seen him on telly.\" Not someone you necessarily want to run to and express gratitude for heroic exploits, not even someone you particularly approve of or admire, no, just a well-known face. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/sep/08/economy.france\">Rachida Dati</a>, Sarkozy's twin sister in terms of abrasiveness, is one of a string of French politicians who have chosen to mimic the president, by playing up to the media, almost hounding journalists in order to be constantly reported on. The new celebrity publications such as Closer, alongside veterans Voici, Gala, VSD and Paris-Match, gladly fell into the trap. Those magazines' editors, breaking the sacrosanct tradition of French public affairs, in which politicians' lives are nobody's business, used the presidential semantic to justify their trashy evolution: it was all in the name of \"transparency\". They also claimed that the French should learn a lesson from the Americans and British who were much more \"advanced\" on the subject. They even dared talking of progress for democracy: politicians should be accountable for everything. With Sarkozy's government, the gossip industry had at last found its match: egotist politicians seeking publicity who would open their doors wide and play the game of fame.</p> <p>Dati's work at the ministry of justice often seemed an excuse in order to reveal la femme cach\u00e9e, with endless photo reportages of her wearing Dior outfits, showing her mingling with showbusiness personalities and millionaires, going on holiday with the president and his then wife C\u00e9cilia. Last autumn, in the few weeks during which the president was single, she seemed to be a possibility for the title of r\u00e9gente, or presidential consort. In March 2008, among the 10 or so happy few to have been invited along with Sarkozy and his new wife Carla Bruni to stay at Windsor, she was the only one to bear her shoulders and reveal not a very <a href=\"http://www.nationalpics.co.uk/pictures_713203/WINDSOR-PALACE-STATE-BANQUET.html\">ministerial d\u00e9colletage</a> at the Queen's dinner. With Bruni now in the picture, though decently attired for the occasion, competition for press coverage was going to get fierce.</p> <p>This frivolous media coverage served another purpose: to make the French forget that, within months of her appointment as justice minister, senior members of her cabinet resigned one after the other, and that her reforms infuriated <a href=\"http://www.marianne2.fr/Rachida-Dati-ne-gardera-sans-doute-plus-les-Sceaux-tres-longtemps_a90835.html?PHPSESSID=3afb0ee33219cce4d84053357ed5ebbe\">the whole profession</a>, with even a few solicitors and barristers going on hunger strike.</p> <p>Today, in France, Dati remains a unique case, that of politician turned celebrity. So far, other members of the government have refrained from courting the media in such a way. Even <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roselyne_Bachelot\">Roselyne Bachelot</a>, the outspoken Health and Sport Minister, offer little competition. Perhaps she should change couturier. Other female government ministers such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama_Yade\"> Rama Yade</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/-Nathalie-KOSCIUSKO-MORIZET-.html\">Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet</a>, respectively human rights secretary of state and environment deputy minister, have deliberately chosen not to play with the fire of self-seeking fame and therefore been spared the media's scrutiny.</p> <p>By denying for weeks the rumour that she was pregnant, eventually issuing a statement confirming the rumours, and declaring in a report for weekly <a href=\"http://www.vsd.fr/\"> VSD</a> that \"her private life was very complicated\", Dati is sure to keep feeding the celebrity magazines' curiosity. But, perhaps, this is part of the plan. As for gossipers, they could have hoped for nothing better than the former Spanish <a href=\"http://www.corriere.it/esteri/08_settembre_03/francia_rachida_dati_incinta_7288ba40-79d4-11dd-9aa0-00144f02aabc.shtml\">Prime Minister Jose-Luis Aznar's denial</a> that he was the father. Let's hope for the sake of French politics that the whole affair remains <em>un cas \u00e0 part</em>.</p>",
  "<p>The finest sight in the world is the view of Edinburgh from Calton Hill, claimed Benjamin Franklin's printer, \"Edinburgh Davey\" Hall, when the boss was planning a visit. You wouldn't catch David Hall making such a claim today. More likely he'd break down in tears.</p> <p>The rot began in the 1960s with the demolition of <a href=\"http://www.edinphoto.org.uk/1_MAP_2/1_map_edinburgh_1819_kirkwood_-_st_james_square.htm\">St James's Square</a> which, had it been spared, might now fulfil a role similar to London's <a href=\"http://www.visitspitalfields.com/\">Spitalfields</a>. Sadly, demi-monde charm was sacrificed for a dreary concrete hulk of shopping mall and government offices. Some 40 years on, and the devastation continues. Past the Georgian terrace by the west of the hill, downtown Milwaukee meets Milton Keynes in a scene which gains a surrealistic twist courtesy of a \"<a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/nikwatt/2541248788/in/photostream/\">corkscrew</a>\" pedestrian bridge linking a megaplex underground car park to the Wilson-era shopping mall.</p> <p>The new Omni Centre and its adjacent office block are, it seems, about to spawn a further wunderkind exercise by architect <a href=\"http://www.ama-ltd.co.uk/docs/AMA/allan_murray_architects.html\">Allan Murray</a>, now making a bigger impact on Edinburgh than <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Adam\">Robert Adam</a>. Murray's rise has been attributed to a developer-friendly output referred to by some as \"wallpaper architecture\". The look, says one rival, is like Radio 2 easy-listening music. Bland and shallow.</p> <p>This new kid on the block arrived after a stint in the US which included work on a glitzy high rise, and his pitch for the big and bold has paid off spectacularly, with virtually every significant project in Edinburgh's world heritage site falling into his lap.</p> <p>Most controversially, he is master-planning a key site between the Old Town and Calton Hill. After a farrago of a planning process, and despite an investigation by Europe and a threat by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/08/heritage.conservation\">Unesco</a> to remove Edinburgh's world heritage status, councillors opted for a city which was \"dynamic\", rather than historic. In other words, they're warming up the flavourless old soup formerly known as \"the rebranding of Britain\", and wrecking the heritage.</p> <p>Murray is only one symptom of this malaise. Travel in from the east, and your are confronted by a hideous viridian screecher, Arc House. The approach from the west will soon have a Wurlitzer skyscraper courtesy of uncompromising modernist, Richard Murphy, who, for good measure, has designed a freakishly modern home for himself next to a Georgian terrace.</p> <p>To these piecemeal intrusions an admixture of tramline construction works has brought chaos, as well as serious economic problems for the city's many traders. The obvious beneficiaries in this case are Forth Ports plc and those speculative developers piling up trendy waterfront homes on the company's extensive landholdings.</p> <p>Forth Ports have agreed to pay \u00a329m towards the tram cost of around \u00a3500m, which sounds generous, until you do the arithmetic. With 15,200 houses planned, that works out at less than \u00a32000 per house, for a line which the vast majority of Edinburgh residents won't have any use for. In a city which passed up the chance to have a modern metro 30 years ago, the words \"transport\" and \"planning\" should never be linked together.</p> <p>Some hope the Scottish government will call in the more damaging schemes for re-appraisal, but the omens are not encouraging. Linda Fabiani, the culture minister, has declared herself a champion of modernism, and while Edinburgh's councillors were busy selling the city's heritage down the river, John Swinney, the finance minister, was reassuring an audience elsewhere that the planning system needed to have its rules relaxed.</p> <p>Edinburgh was once the home of <a href=\"http://www.edinburgh-royalmile.com/famous-scots/patrick-geddes.html\">Patrick Geddes</a>, father of modern planning.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2699173/Eat-less-red-meat-to-help-the-environment-UN-climate-expert-says.html\">The call</a> \u2013 from a leading United Nations expert on climate change \u2013 for us all to eat less meat for the sake of the planet sounds plausible enough, especially if you're inclined toward the vegetarian lifestyle.</p> <p>Dr Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the UN panel on <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/Themes/climatechange/Todo/index.asp\">climate change</a> is himself a vegetarian. He argues that by cutting back our meat consumption \u2013 perhaps by introducing one meat-free day a week \u2013 we could have a major impact on climate change at little inconvenience to ourselves.</p> <p>At the core of his argument is the idea that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/07/food.foodanddrink\">meat production</a> generates huge amounts of greenhouse gases. Cattle, for example, produce damaging methane while consuming cereal grains grown with heavy inputs of fossil fuels. Therefore cutting back on our beef consumption ought to be good for the planet.</p> <p>However, it's a flawed argument. What matters is not the amount of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/07/food.meat\">meat we eat</a> \u2013 but the way it's produced. Far from hastening climate change, our meat-eating habit could be the way to a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly pattern of food production.</p> <p>When I was an agricultural student in the 1960s, most of our animal-based foods came from livestock grazing fresh pasture or feeding on conserved grass in the form of hay and silage. Pasture fields increase the amount of carbon stored in the soil. When they contain plenty of nitrogen-fixing clovers they are able to sustain high outputs of meat and dairy foods without the need for energy-rich nitrate fertilisers.</p> <p>Today many farmers have turned their backs on pasture land, traditionally the foundation of food production in Britain. Instead they confine their animals to sheds for much of the year, feeding them on cereals and other grains traded on global markets. It's this fundamental change in the way meat and dairy foods are produced that has made these foods so damaging to the global environment.</p> <p>With its mild, moist climate, Britain is uniquely placed to grow good grass. Through the centuries pastures have produced many of our basic foods including our beef and lamb; our poultry and eggs; our milk butter and cheese. In the Middle Ages grasslands even built our first big export industry, the wool trade, an incredible wealth creator which enabled Britain to emerge as a world power. </p> <p>Grasslands gave us a secure and stable supply of food. It wasn't dependent on imported oil and fertiliser. Nor was it threatened by periodic droughts or flooding, events that can seriously damage grain-based food systems. </p> <p>And even as Britain's pastures supplied us with healthy foods, they were taking carbon from the atmosphere and storing it away safely in organic material in the soil. Far from damaging the world's climate, grasslands help to stabilise it. There are even plants in traditional grasslands \u2013 the yellow-flowering bird's-foot trefoil is one \u2013 which reduce the methane emissions of ruminant animals.</p> <p>All these environmental benefits of pasture-based foods we have given up in our move to a grain-based food system. Grain-growing depletes the soil of nutrients and releases huge amounts of soil carbon into the atmosphere, hastening climate change. It's a food system that makes good profits for large corporations such as grain traders, pesticide manufacturers and oil companies, but it puts small family farms out of business.</p> <p>It's not meat-eating that the world can no longer afford \u2013 it's the agribusiness companies who have hijacked it. We can all help build a healthy planet \u2013 not by giving up meat \u2013 but by making sure the meat we buy is produced, as it always used to be, on grass.</p>",
  "<p>The price of oil rose today ahead of tomorrow's meeting of the oil producers' cartel Opec and amid fears over the onset of Hurricane Ike.</p> <p>The price of light crude hit a high of $109.12 before settling to $107.52, up $1.28, while Brent crude was up 91 cents to $105.</p> <p>Oil prices have fallen almost 30% since peaking at $147 a barrel in July, tracking a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies\">strengthening dollar</a> and the faltering state of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globaleconomy\">global economy</a>.</p> <p>There are some voices in Opec, the 13-strong cartel of producers that controls 40% of the world's crude, calling for production cuts to protect the price.</p> <p>Iran's oil minister, Gholam Hossein Nozari, said there was too much crude in the market. </p> <p>\"We believe the market is oversupplied,\" he told journalists today, in remarks reported by Associated Press. </p> <p>Nozari has stated that he believes $100 a barrel should serve as a floor for the price of oil. </p> <p>Opec's oil ministers are meeting in Vienna tomorrow to decide what to do about production levels. </p> <p>Iran and Venezuela take a more hawkish position than Saudi Arabia, which as Opec's leading producer holds most sway among the cartel's members.</p> <p>Earlier in the year Opec faced pressure to increase production as the oil price rocketed to record levels. </p> <p>The producers maintained that the weak dollar and speculators were to blame for the spectacular gains in the value of oil. </p> <p>But the slide since the price peaked on July 11 has raised the prospect that production could be cut to defend the $100 barrel.</p> <p>Hurricane Ike, which is expected to hit the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico later in the week, is also a factor weighing on the oil price. </p> <p>The oil price rose slightly last week as Hurricane Gustav approached the US coast but fell back below $110 a barrel once it transpired that oil platforms and refineries in the Gulf of Mexico had been left unscathed.</p> <p>Royal Dutch Shell said it would keep staffing at its offshore installations to a minimum as Ike approaches.</p>",
  "<p> <em>Gartner's numbers for Preliminary Smartphone Sales to End Users by Operating System, 2Q08 (Units) -- Click for larger version</em></p> <p>The smartphone market is a hard one to track because of devices sold under a wide variety of names, and because research firms have different definitions of smart phones. It's also subject to change when new products take off (like the Apple iPhone) or fade. In other words, don't bet your house on anybody's \"real\" market share.</p> <p>Still, according to Gartner, Nokia is still by far the market leader with 47.5% of the smartphone market on 15.2m units sold to users. However, its market share has dropped from 50.8% in the same quarter last year.</p> <p>Research in Motion (RIM) has done well with BlackBerry sales growing by 126.4% to 5.6m units, year over year, and it has now overtaken Windows Mobile.</p> <p>Apple did not star in this quarter because it was in a product transition. Gartner comments:</p> <blockquote> <p>In the second quarter of 2008, Apple's share of global smartphone sales to end users decreased to 2.8% from 5.3% in the first quarter of 2008. The significant drop in sales was mainly due to the company having to clean the channel of first-generation iPhone units before the arrival of the iPhone 3G in June. Apple's sales figure in the second quarter of 2008 accounted for sales of inventory carried over from the first quarter of 2008. Gartner analysts expect iPhone sales to grow significantly in the second half of 2008, enabling the company to regain a top position in the global smartphone vendor rankings.</p> </blockquote> <p>It's interesting to see that Palm grew strongly from a low base, thanks to new products, while Linux declined. That may well be down to Motorola, and Google's Android will no doubt reverse the trend.</p>",

Photograph: Stephen Moss</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Moss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'm often asked where my favourite place is to watch birds. People expect me to reel off a list of the UK's birding hotspots, or iconic locations around the world. Yet at this time of year it's hard to beat a little corner of my own garden on the Somerset Levels \u2013 specifically that little corner with an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elderberry\">elder tree</a>, covered with juicy black berries.</p> <p>Every morning, as I scan the foliage with my binoculars, I see birds. Some, like the robin and blackbird, are feeding greedily on the berries; others, like the shy and retiring <a href=\"http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob13111.htm\">chiffchaff</a>, are busily picking tiny insects off the leaves. In the past few weeks I have seen more than a dozen different kinds of birds feeding on this one plant \u2013 sparrows and starlings, blue tits and great tits, song thrushes and dunnocks, and many more. </p> <p>The other day I noticed a small, neat, greyish-looking bird feeding unobtrusively on the berries. It was a <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/l/lesserwhitethroat/index.asp\">lesser whitethroat</a> a member of the warbler family which is notoriously difficult to see, because of its skulking habits. But this one was happily feeding in the open, so close that I could see every detail of its plumage. It was a neat, fresh juvenile \u2013 greyish-brown above and paler below, with a distinctive dark mask across its eyes. </p> <p>This tiny bird is about to make the trip of a lifetime, migrating to west Africa via the Middle East \u2013 a distance of several thousand kilometres. To build up fat reserves for the journey, it is busily stuffing its face with as many elderberries as it can; while grabbing passing insects to add protein to its diet.</p> <p>Now for the clever bit. Birds, and the berry-bearing plants they feed on, are examples of <a href=\"http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/tutorials/Coevolution1.asp\">co-evolution for mutual benefit</a>. The plants provide succulent, colourful, fleshy fruits which are irresistible to a passing bird. But at the centre of the fruit is a seed \u2013 the plant's <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/features/berries.asp \">genetic insurance policy</a>. </p> <p>Seeds are tough and (mostly) indigestible, so they pass through the bird's gut undamaged, before being deposited some distance away. By enticing birds to feed on its fruit, the plant has given itself the best possible chance of dispersing its seeds over the widest possible area.</p> <p>It doesn't always work. Birds such as finches are known as 'seed-predators', because they are able to digest (and so destroy) the seed. In such cases, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/birds/weeklyfeature/berrywars/ \">host plant gets no benefit</a>. </p> <p>But usually the relationship benefits both sides. Plants such as hawthorn, bramble and wild cherry produce an abundance of red or black fruits (the colours most easily perceived by birds), and the birds happily take advantage of the free meal. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/04/01/eabirds101.xml\">Birds have even learned</a> which berries are <br>highest in antioxidants, to help them keep fit and healthy. </p> <p>Berries are especially important at this time of year for migrating birds, but also throughout the winter months, when alternative food sources are scarce. <br> Some species, such as the mistle thrush, will even defend a particular berry bush throughout the winter, driving off any rivals; while soon my hawthorn bushes will be visited by flocks of hungry <a href=\"http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob11980.htm\">fieldfares</a> and <a href=\"http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob12010.htm\">redwings</a>, Scandinavian thrushes which arrive here in October, to take advantage of our mild winter climate. <br> And boy, do these birds eat. David and Barbara Snow, authors of the seminal work on the subject, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Birds-Berries-Study-Ecological-Interaction/dp/0856610496 \">Birds and Berries</a>, watched a single blackbird eat over 300 Pyracantha berries in a single day \u2013 equivalent to its own weight in food. The gold medallist of berry-eaters, the <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/w/waxwing/index.asp\">waxwing</a>, has been known to take more than 1,000 berries in a day, or twice its body weight.</p> <p>Soon, as autumn gives way to winter, I shall be hoping for an invasion of waxwings, which do occasionally reach this far west. In the meantime, the lesser whitethroat appears to have moved on, and is already crossing Europe on the first leg of its epic journey.</p>",
  "<p>If there is a green moment, this is it. As the planet warms and food and fuel prices rise, people are becoming more susceptible to radical alternatives to the status quo. But if the Greens are to capitalise on this opportunity, they will have to reform their reputation and increase their economic credibility. </p> <p>Science has already done great things for the environmental movement. It was science that turned global warming from eco-conspiracy to mainstream threat. But for the public to vote green, the party's solutions to global warming will have to become as credible as its diagnoses. We need a party of the <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm\">Stern report</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/\">IPPR</a> rather than of vegans and hippies (as nice as they are). In short, if the Green party is ever to replicate the success of its equivalents in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_party#Green_Parties_in_Europe\">Europe</a>, it will have to convince the public that its policies are economically viable as well as environmentally sustainable. </p> <p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7601832.stm\">Caroline Lucas</a> \u2013 the first ever leader of the party, elected on Friday \u2013 is a highly credible face for the Greens. But she's presiding over a membership that \u2013 if the annual conference this weekend was anything to go by \u2013 spontaneously bursts into applause at the mere mention the term \"capital controls\". </p> <p>The Green party's solution to our economic and environmental woes \u2013 the \"<a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/greennewdealneededforuk210708.aspx\">Green new deal</a>\" \u2013 is also likely to raise the eyebrows of economists. The deal aims to 1) tighten financial regulation and increase taxation in order to 2) fund a renewable energy revolution that will \"turn every building into a power station\". By training an \"army\" of green workers to carry out these measures, the party also hopes to cure the expected rise in unemployment.</p> <p>At a cost of \u00a350-70bn, this plan raises some serious questions about debt and inflation. Won't greater spending simply raise the interest rate, disincentivise private investment and increase the burden of indebted families? I'm not saying that the Greens can't answer these questions \u2013 I'm saying that if the public is to swallow such a radical agenda, the party's plans will have to be backed by respected economists, thinktanks and policy-makers. The party will have to present its facts as well as it does its vision, its research as well as its rhetoric. </p> <p>The Green party is often charged with naivety, but recent events have proven other parties equally vulnerable to that accusation. Labour has presided over a period of endemic over-optimism in the financial markets, leaving banks to profit from bad loans unhindered by regulation or enforced transparency. The fact that climate emissions have <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4849672.stm#graph\">barely changed</a> since 1997 and that social inequality has <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3526752.stm\">increased</a> demonstrates similar irresponsibility. </p> <p>Those of us who are disillusioned with the Labour record should consider the Green alternative. But if the Greens want to win our support, they too will have to change. Green shoots may be sprouting, but just how far they grow depends on the party's ability to become an organisation of economic pragmatism as well as warm-hearted principle.</p>",

  "<p> From G to A to X ... John Berger. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.johnberger.org/\">John Berger</a> may be comfortably into his ninth decade and he may have chosen to write this elegant little book in the form of an epistolary novel - a curious anomaly in the internet age - but it would be a mistake to assume that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/jul/29/bookerprize\">From A To X</a> is in any way old-fashioned. It is fiercely contemporary and unabashedly experimental.</p> <p>Let me hurry to point out that I don't mean \"experimental\" as a euphemism for \"pretentious\" and \"incomprehensible\", as the word is often used. There's an enjoyable playfulness in Berger's form and style, but the letters are all grounded in (an often painful) reality and his games all deepen rather than hinder comprehension.</p> <p>Even the use of letters quickly ceases to seem eccentric since they are so apt for purpose. In an enjoyably teasing prologue Berger asks us to believe that he's found the mysteriously discovered missives that a woman called Ai'da sent to her lover Xavier while he was incarcerated in a tiny prison cell, accompanied by a few notes of his added in blank spaces. It's hard to imagine a better medium for allowing communication between the two lovers, nor for conveying their desperation to bridge the gap that has been placed between them.</p> <p>It works admirably, while there's real intrigue in the way it keeps their back story in the shadows, with just a few tantalising hints about their involvement in an organisation opposed to the regime that has imprisoned Xavier. Berger makes similarly profitable use of the uncertainties of meaning resulting from the couple's clandestine activities. Is a description of a tango Ai'da performed simply there to let Xavier glimpse into her life? Or are her references to the \"cuts\" she made some kind of code? Is Ai'da really playing canasta? Or is that a cover for political meetings? We never find out, but the act of speculating helps us appreciate the paranoia and intrigue that must be Ai'da's daily lot - as well as being an enjoyable tease.</p> <p>A few of the usual problems from relying on correspondence for narrative drive remain. Most notably, Ai'da frequently tells Xavier things he already knows, generating the feeling that Berger is writing more for the reader than the letters' supposed recipient. Xavier's contributions, meanwhile, tend to feel like lectures. \"Decolonisation,\" we learn, \"refers not only to the practice of moving production and services to where labour is cheapest, but also to the plan of destroying the statue of all earlier fixed places so that the entire world becomes a Nowhere, and a single liquid market.\"</p> <p>But at least they are lectures with the rare virtues of being short, interesting and provocative. It's also pleasing to think how such attacks on market-driven morality must make the toes of <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/books/2007/12/michael_portillo_and_man_booke.html\">Michael Portillo</a> curl. But less partisan people than he might also resent Berger's sledgehammer technique. It's certainly dramatically effective that the only human personalities described in the book are those on the left, while the forces of oppression are represented by Apache helicopters, missiles that appear from nowhere and eyes behind riot shields. But it's hard not to feel complexities are lost in such a one-sided approach.</p> <p>Fortunately, it's not as a political book that From A To X stands or falls. The real centre lies in Ai'da's attempt to convey something of the world outside to her confined lover. Here Berger's simple descriptive brilliance comes into play as Ai'da conjures the smell of coffee, delicately expresses the way a cat moves or talks of an old man who has \"that careful way of walking that old men ... sometimes develop. As if they are carrying a full basin of water they don't want to spill over.\"</p> <p>Best of all is an evocation of the absolute trust Ai'da had to put in the skill of Xavier when he performed loop-the-loops for her as she sat beside him in a plane. It's a description of the vertiginous exhilaration of flight I have seen equalled only once before - not coincidentally in <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/books/2008/01/looking_back_at_the_booker_joh.html\">Berger's previous Booker winner G</a>.</p> <p>Ai'da isn't an invariably delightful correspondent. She does a painful amount of \"weeping\". The bright gold of many of her observations is tempered by the oddness of others: \"As soon as a woman is living in a room, its ceiling curves.\" But even when From A to X is abstrluse and absurd there's some mitigation. The bum notes help to complete the score of Ai'da. Over time the realisation that she is imperfect becomes poignant, just as the many drawings of hands that she sends to her lover in a desperate attempt to touch him are all the more moving because of their crudeness.</p> <p>The result is a book of real power. It's cranky, it probably takes itself far too seriously and occasionally even might be accurately termed - <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/08/09/bober110.xml\">as Sam Leith thunders in the Telegraph</a> - \"bollocks\". More often there are moments of magnificence that elevate it above the other longlist books I've read so far.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2008/jun/17/booktrustteenageprize\">Next time: The Lost Dog - Michelle De Krester</a></p>",
  "<p>Our country is changing. The economy, technology, our population, society, and politics, at home and abroad, are all being transformed, and these five revolutions, linked together, are taking us into a new world. Never before have so many changes taken place simultaneously in so many different spheres, so quickly, and with such potentially radical consequences. And new times and new challenges have to summon forth new answers.</p> <p>This new world is one of huge promise and opportunity. Our children could live lives of which our parents could only dream.</p> <p>The world economy will double in size and wealth over the next 25 years, bringing new prosperity and opportunities. We can be certain that some countries will benefit disproportionately, and so will some people: the wealthy and powerful can always seize the opportunities of change.</p> <p>Our task, as a party, as a government, now is to ensure that our country and all of our people make the most of these opportunities and are protected against the risks that accompany radical change.</p> <p>The quest to ensure that power, wealth, and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few, is fundamental to our purpose. This is why the Labour party exists. It is what enabled us to rise to the challenge of the times in 1945. And again in 1997. And it is why we will now rise again to meet the challenges of this new world.</p> <p>The changes we are witnessing bring with them new challenges in every aspect of our lives:</p> <p>\u0095 Economic restructuring, driven by globalisation, has meant increased opportunity for many but also reduced security for lower skilled workers; unskilled jobs, once in the majority, are now rare: so, we need to ensure that everyone has the skills to work and prosper in this new world.</p> <p>\u0095 Growth intensifies the pressures of climate change which we must tackle for the sake of all the generations who come after us.</p> <p>\u0095 Greater freedoms than our people have ever known have also brought with them new strains on communities and family life.</p> <p>\u0095 The boundaries which mark out civilised society have been eroded.</p> <p>\u0095 New risks from abroad mean we need to reduce our dependence on oil to ensure energy security.</p> <p>\u0095 New threats from terror need to be tackled at source, whether at home or abroad, and require a more joined-up response.</p> <p>\u0095 Parents face new pressures of time and money in raising their family and the increasingly difficult task of juggling work and family life.</p> <p>\u0095 People are living longer and healthy lives but we need to ensure that everyone in the older generations who has given so much to our country receives the security in old age they are entitled to expect.</p> <p>\u0095 Since 1997, the accelerating advances in technology have completely transformed the way that people communicate, do business, and share ideas with each other.</p> <p>\u0095 Political change has opened up new opportunities for individuals to participate and mobilise but has also created new challenges for political parties and governments to meet such rising expectations.</p> <p>So instead of repeating the solutions of yesterday we must embrace the new policies of tomorrow and restate the case for our party and our values. Meeting this challenge will not be easy and it will not happen overnight. There are no easy or quick answers. It requires leadership, squaring up to hard truths, being open with the British people about the choices we face, and making tough decisions on priorities for public spending.</p> <p>I do not underestimate these challenges but I believe that Britain's future is bright. We will bring resolution to the task and determination to build, brick by brick, the foundations for success in this new world. We have already acted to help many of those most directly affected by the economic difficulties sweeping across the world: those struggling to pay higher energy and fuel prices, and those who have to move home.</p> <p>In this document, we will set out the argument about the new approaches we need to meet the new challenges:</p> <p>\u0095 immediate support for those struggling with the impact of global instability,</p> <p>\u0095 investing in the education and skills of all people,</p> <p>\u0095 a new deal for the elderly,</p> <p>\u0095 new support for parents and new approaches to delivering public services,</p> <p>\u0095 and the long-term decisions on transport, energy, and climate change.</p> <p>We must reach out to work with individuals, communities, and business for all the people of our country. The yearning for fairness, the unremitting quest for it, and the delivery of it in everything we do, is fundamental to our party. Our policies today and everything we have done since 1997 are driven by our belief in fairness.</p> <p>I know there are people who feel that modern Britain has been unfair to them. Some of them are right. But there is nothing that is bad about Britain that cannot be overcome by what is good about Britain, as long as we keep faith with our belief in fairness. Throughout our history, this nation has repeatedly demonstrated a proud spirit of cautious and practical optimism and we call on that spirit once again.</p> <p>Fair rules, fair chances, and a fair say for everyone: that is the new deal for this new world.</p> <p>My own response to the great challenges in my own life has been to confront them, resolute in the belief that there would always be something that could be done to overcome them. And there always has been. Now, once more, I am confident that we can come through this difficult economic time and meet these challenges a stronger, more secure, and fairer country than ever before.</p> <p>None of us can address all the new challenges we all face on our own. We are all in this together - individuals, families, business, trades unions, civil society and government - all with our part to play. Together, in this new world of opportunity and change, there is nothing Britain cannot do.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's media companies are getting poorer. When the stock exchange announces its list of promotions and relegations tomorrow, the number of media firms in the FTSE 100 will be at its lowest level for more than a decade. <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/\">ITV's</a> relegation will mean that only 5% per cent of the country's top 100 enterprises will be media companies, down from 10% in the early noughties.</p> <p>According to research by the accountants and business advisers <a href=\"http://www.bdo.co.uk/bdosh/website/bdouk/websitecontent.nsf/WebSite/National?Open\">BDO Stoy Hayward</a>, both technology and telecoms companies are fairing much better than their media counterparts.</p> <p>Recent media leavers include <a href=\"http://www.yellgroup.com/\">the Yell group</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.dmgt.co.uk/\">Daily Mail &amp; General Trust</a>.

But is ITV ready for that online challenge? Like the other poor market performers, it may also be relying on a post-credit-crunch boost.

  "<p>The damage caused by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> means that members of the Derbyshire and Cheshire building societies will not receive a windfall payment when the pair are swallowed by Nationwide.</p> <p>Nationwide, the UK's largest building society, is stepping in to take control of the Derbyshire and the Cheshire after both ran up losses in the recent financial turmoil. The rescue deal could also cost hundreds of jobs.</p> <p>In an announcement this morning, Nationwide chief executive Graham Beale said that it was not prepared to risk its financial stability by paying a windfall to members of the two smaller societies, as is usually the case.</p> <p>This is a blow to members of both societies, who might have expected to profit from the deal. Two years ago, when Nationwide merged with Portman, there were payouts of between \u00a3200 and \u00a31,000.</p> <p>Beale explained today that both societies have run up significant losses this year, thanks to the credit crunch and the falling UK housing market. The Derbyshire, which has assets of \u00a37.1bn, expects to post an unaudited pre-tax loss of \u00a317m for the half year to June 30. Most of this loss is due to a decline in the value of its near-prime, sub-prime and commercial loan portfolios, Nationwide said.</p> <p>The Cheshire, which has assets of \u00a34.9bn, expects to incur an unaudited pre-tax loss of \u00a310.5m for the same period.</p> <p>Nationwide said today that it plans to maintain both branch networks, which should mean no job losses there. However there are expected to be cuts at the back offices of both societies.</p> <p>\"Inevitably in the head office environment, where we have overlapping functions, we will look to rationalise. The expectation is that job losses will be relatively modest and contained, but we're reluctant to give a number at this stage,\" said Beale.</p> <p>The Derbyshire has 470 head office employees, while the Cheshire employs 356.</p> <p>Analysts believe that today's deal will put pressure on other building societies to merge as the crisis in the mortgage market deepens. With sales down by half since last year and prices set to halve in real terms from their peak, smaller societies are under pressure to join forces to provide greater security for customers.</p> <p>Many smaller societies lack the capital needed to lend at a time when rises in arrears and house price falls increase the risk of them losing money on their mortgage deals.</p> <p>This year the FSA, the City watchdog led by Hector Sants, warned building societies to consider how they would survive a prolonged credit squeeze. It said they were accumulating too much risk in buy-to-let mortgages and not preparing for \"extreme stress scenarios\".</p>",
  "<p>This weekend's heavy rainfall has caused havoc across the UK, with an estimated 1,000 homes flooded in the Northumberland town of Morpeth alone. Homeowners in other parts of the country are also mopping up, and forecasts of further downpours later in the week could cause even more problems. </p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/25/flooding.insurance\">independent review into last year's floods</a>, the author, Sir Michael Pitt, warned against an \"ever-increasing risk\" of flooding. So what should you do if you and your home fall victim?</p> <h2>There's water everywhere - what should I do?</h2> <p>If your home is actually underwater it's too late to worry about saving existing items, but you can start thinking about what to do once the waters start to recede. Your first step should be to call your insurance company - most have 24-hour emergency helplines.</p> <h2>What if I can't find my policy document? </h2> <p>Don't panic - your insurer should be able to find you on its database. Look on its website or call a directory enquiries line to get its number. Remember that your building and contents cover may be with different companies so you may need to put in two calls. If you car is also under water you will have to call your motor insurance company as well. Bear in mind you will only be able to make a claim if you have fully comprehensive cover.</p> <h2>What should I do next? </h2> <p>If you are able to stay in your property but need help to prevent further damage, the <a href=\"http://www.abi.org.uk/\"> Association of British Insurers</a> (ABI) recommends you speak to your insurer before arranging emergency repairs, and that you keep any receipts for work done so you can claim for the cost. Where possible, take photographs to record the damage as this could help with your insurance claim.</p> <p>Also remember that water and electricity don't mix, so make sure the electrics are checked out before you flick any switches - you should be able to claim for this on your buildings policy. Don't throw damaged things away, even if you will need to replace them. For example, you may be able to claim for new kitchen units if your current ones have soaked up water and are beyond repair, but you should try to dry them out and keep them until a loss adjuster has seen them.</p> <p>A loss adjuster will be sent round by your insurer to assess what damage has been done and to work out how much your pay out should be.</p> <h2>What if I have had to leave my property? </h2> <p>In the first instance, you may be moved to emergency shelter by the rescue services, but after that you may need to move somewhere else while work is done to make your house habitable again. Building and contents insurance will usually include provision for alternative accommodation if the damage is so great that you are unable to stay at home. If you have both types of policy, your building insurer will be expected to take care of your claim for somewhere to stay.</p> <p>Most insurers will ask you to approve with them the accommodation you are moving to before your stay begins. Sadly, they are unlikely to stretch to the Ritz - alternative accommodation is supposed to be in keeping with your normal lifestyle, so for most people that will mean a standard hotel or B&amp;B, at least in the short term.</p> <p>Your policy is likely to have a limit on how much will be paid out for alternative accommodation - according to the ABI, this is typically around 20% of the sum insured. If you spend more than that, you will be liable for the cost.</p> <h2>What if I can't move back for a long time? </h2> <p>The 20% limit stands, even if long-term shelter is needed, but if you don't want to stay in a hotel or B&amp;B you should be able to arrange some accommodation that feels a bit more like home.</p> <p>After last year's floods in Hull, many homeowners decided they would like to stay in mobile homes on their drives so they could still use the top floors of their homes and have easy access to anything they might need. This is an option, as is staying in a flat. \"It is up to the individual policyholder what they want to do, and the insurance company will pay for it,\" says a spokeswoman for the ABI. \"It will either send you a cheque or pay for it directly.\"</p> <h2>And what if I get burgled while my home is empty? </h2> <p>Sadly, empty homes and cars seem to be a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,,2115738,00.html\"> temptation for looters</a>, so if you are forced to leave your property you should do your best to secure it. Unfortunately, if you leave in a hurry and don't lock your doors or windows then you will be unable to claim for any items that are stolen.</p> <p>\"There has to be a break in for a claim to be successful - it's exactly the same as if there isn't a flood,\" says the ABI. If your home has been broken into, your insurer will pay for the missing items as well as those damaged by the floodwater.</p> <h2>When will I receive a pay out? </h2> <p>It could take months for insurers to process claims and arrange payouts, but you may be offered an interim payment to help you buy essentials. After last summer's floods in Gloucestershire and Herefordshire, many insurers made immediate payments of \u00a3500 to help policyholders with short-term expenses.</p> <h2>Will I be able to get cover again? </h2> <p>Insurers have said they will carry on offering flood cover to as many homeowners as possible, and many have said they will allow customers to renew existing cover. The problem may come if you try to shop around, as no insurer is obliged to take your business. You may be offered a policy that would pay out in other circumstances, but not if you end up under water again, which will be little comfort when you know how disruptive a flood can be, and you live in an area at risk.</p> <p>If you stay with your existing insurer you could find that when you come to renew your policy your premiums have risen, and other terms such as the level of excess have changed. If this is the case you should shop around for a new policy, but you may find you have little choice but to pay up.</p>",
  "<p>On magazine covers in France last week I kept noticing photos of a chic woman I didn't recognise but who was clearly pregnant and possibly 42. \"Some Cannes actress up the duff,\" I muttered and thought no more. </p> <p>Only on returning to Britain did I realise the mystery thespian was actually <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachida_Dati \">Rachida Dati</a>, Nicholas Sarkozy's high-flying justice minister, the Gallic Jack Straw. As the child of North African Muslim immigrants, the unmarried and decidedly secular Dati ticks a lot of prurient boxes for the media, even in France where discretion usually prevails.</p> <p>Contrasting French tolerance towards public sexual permissiveness (at least in Paris) with American uptightness - as usual Britain is caught somewhere in between - some Fleet St papers wondered \"how long the French can get away with it?\" Since the father of Dati's child is publicly unknown \"who's the dad?\" - VIP or one-night stand? - is part of the fun, if you like that sort of thing.</p> <p>In the corner of rural France where we hang out folk don't gossip much to strangers. But in the week when the TUC meets in Brighton to fight for the living standards of its members my holiday prompted another question about the way the French live: \"How long can they all get away with it?''</p> <p>The question was lodged in my mind when we stayed overnight in Orleans, 80 miles south west of Paris. It's a handsome, historic city of 110,000 or so, quietly prosperous like so many less well-known places in France. </p> <p>What startled me was to be reminded just how much such places simply shut down for the annual fortnight's holiday - or longer - in August. </p> <p>Orleans may be a tourist town but if the local customers are heading to the Med or Atlantic coasts, the lakes or mountains, so does most of the retail trade, even major department stories like Galleries Lafayette in Orleans. Row upon row of shops had \"back on August 25\" - or September 1 - signs Sellotaped to the window. </p> <p>I know Paris is quiet in August. So is London, though it doesn't suspend parking charges for the month, as the French capital does. </p> <p>Its retail sector and restaurants certainly don't shut down. Perhaps they should. But as we have moved towards a 24/7 consumer culture since Margaret Thatcher's controversial repeal of Sunday trading the French have moved the other way, reducing the working week to 35 hours a week in 1998. </p> <p>It is a law subsequently modified, but still making for complicated opening hours, often different every day. Sunday closing is de rigueur.</p> <p>\"They're not acquisitive in the way we are. If they can pay the bills and the car starts in the morning, they're more concerned with family and food, with enjoying life,\" a long-time English resident later explained over a coffee at the market in Villefranche. \"The shopkeepers say, 'we're entitled to a holiday too.'\"</p> <p>I wouldn't quite express their anti-materialism quite that way, since they charge a lot for services (I think the meaning translates differently) and are keen to be paid in cash. That is why French banks have to restrict the amount their customers can withdraw from ATM machines in a given period, to curb the black economy. </p> <p>In Italy, friends tell me, Berlusconi's new regime has relaxed such restrictions: a bad sign. Sarko is trying to reform bad habits - and has an electoral mandate to do so. But yesterday's papers quote a French teacher complaining that they don't want him copying British suburbs. \"They're all slaves to the free market over there (Britain), it's just like America.\" Sarkozy has an uphill struggle.</p> <p>All the same, you can see their point of view. France is a beautiful, diverse and largely uncrowded country with some wonderful habits. It's corny, I know, but every time I marvel at the butchers, the bread, the country markets, the cheese. </p> <p>The downside is the difficulty of getting a coffee in downtown Orleans before 10am. or of knowing exactly when the shops will be open for basics - or unexpectedly closed. I've been trying to get it right for years and still fail.</p> <p> Sometimes, I swear, they shut when they think some looming customers might disrupt their day. Heading south this year we found ourselves off the motorway (much less stressful) near <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issoudun\">Issoudun</a>, which boasts an excellent restaurant in La Coquille. Did they have a table for lunch? Had we booked? No. In that case, sorry but no. After a pizza and pastry round the corner I peeped through La Coquille's window: it didn't look too full to me.</p> <p>This may be a standards thing (the chef can only supervise so many excellent meals), but in Paris on our last night a kind woman hesitated, then fitted us in. But I think it's deeper attitude at work. </p> <p>I tried to buy a few bottles of Tariquet, a striking Chardonnay/Sauvignon blend from Gascony which I like, at what passes for the village wine merchant.</p> <p>In week one the charming patron told me her supplier was on holiday. I was busy in week two. In week three I found her closed on Tuesday and Wednesday as well as the (usual) Monday. </p> <p>Heading for home on Friday and spotting she was open, I stopped and found some Tariquet on the shelf at last. \"I'll take a case of that,\" I said. \"Sorry, they're my last four bottles and he's told me there won't be any more this year. Come back next year,'' she said - but nicely.</p> <p>Do you laugh or cry? I laughed and took the four bottles, plus two more she recommended so she gave me a bottle for free. Trying to buy her favourite pain au raisin across the street my wife had the same experience: sorry, we've sold out (this was mid-morning).</p> <p>It all infuriates me, even more so a close friend who has to juggle French labour laws and meet a payroll. Yet at one level I admire its deep-seated, producer-orientated bloody-mindedness and the majority's quality of life.</p> <p>Alas, back in the car we started listening again to The Age of Uncertainly, the 9-CD abridgement of Alan Greenspan's memoirs, a gift from my son. Yes, <em>that</em> Greenspan, the ex-chairman of the US Federal Reserve. You listen to Arctic Monkeys or Catherine Cookson if you want to. I prefer US monetary policy.</p> <p>Chairman Al is a clever chap, as he would admit without the threat of torture. And he tells a good, if discreetly-worded, tale of serving five presidents, not including Nixon, whose private personality disturbed him. </p> <p>Nixon and Bill Clinton were the cleverest, but he greatly admired Gerry Ford for decency, quiet self-confidence and straight-dealing: a moderate Republican like himself. </p> <p>You can tell Greenspan must have been quietly appalled to discover that Ford veterans like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld had become born-again ideologues by the time they joined George W Bush's White House team in 2001.</p> <p>That's not my point. Nor is his relief that \"my good friend Gordon Brown\" and Tony Blair had dropped the damaging economic nostrums of Fabian socialism by the time they took power in 1997.</p> <p>Central economic planning doesn't work; what has worked to extend global prosperity to untold millions is the rule of law, entrenched property rights and capitalism, plus accountable democratic governments, Greenspan believes. </p> <p>His hero is Brown's fellow-Kirkcaldy-ite, Adam Smith, author of The Wealth of Nations (1776) and champion of the \"hidden hand\" of the market. He's not a hero in France.</p> <p>Greenspan's memoirs strike me as a bit disingenuous, sometimes plain na\u00efve, about politics, a craft which he has seen close up, albeit from a ringside seat. </p> <p>He condemns the damaging economic impact of authoritarian regimes and Latino economic populism, of Fabian socialism and communism, all of which end up making poor people poorer than they need to be. </p> <p>He is acutely aware - as the TUC will be in Brighton this week - of widening inequality of incomes in many countries (China's gap is wider than the US's own, he claims) and how it may lead to false remedies. Latin America needs more market capitalism, not less, to break the distortions of oligarchical power, says the chairman. </p> <p>As for the US, it will correct its own failures, he believes - a touch complacently, I thought. American financial capitalism recklessly privatises profit and socialises the risk and a lot of it happened towards the end of Greenspan's long (1987-2006) tenure at the Fed. The emergency rescue of Fanny Mae and Freddy Mac this weekend underlines just how serious things have become.</p> <p>Where is this ramble leading me? Back to France, of course. Not to Ms Dati's baby - the jazz-loving intellectual Greenspan is a bit of a prude - but to the country's way of life. </p> <p>Most French voters would rather work for the government; only 35% believe market capitalism is the best way (half the US proportion); France has slipped to 45th on the economic freedom scale, he notes; its unemployment remains stubbornly high.</p> <p>Despite boasting some very successful global firms, \"it is difficult not to be gloomy\" about France in the new age of globalisation, concludes Greenspan, quoting Jacques Chirac to the effect that \"ultra-liberalism is as big a danger as communism was\" and his ex-premier \u00c9douard Balladur calling markets \"the law of the jungle\". </p> <p>The EU has \"culture-driven structural problems\" which have slowed growth and pushed up unemployment, he insists. Italy's plight is worse than France's and Japan's protracted slump arose because the system there refused to lose face by liquidating failed banks and their worthless debts. </p> <p>People do vote to defer pain, they sometimes vote for folly, he suggests. Ex-British colonies are among the most prosperous, thanks to that rule of law habit, though Singapore is better on law than democracy and Zimbabwe has made every mistake in the book. </p> <p>But there is no escaping hard choices, no hiding place, not even Burma. If Greenspan is more right than wrong - I fear he is - then it means my village wine merchant and her fellow-countrymen may have to raise their game. </p> <p>Come to think of it, some of her bottles have acquired distinctly-Australian-looking labels lately, though she denies it. Some of the contents taste a bit foreign too. Has globalisation crept into rural France? Will it save or ruin them?</p>",
  "<p>Scotland's leading serious newspapers - <strong>The Scotsman</strong> and <strong>The Herald</strong> - are in peril, according to a former media correspondent, <strong>Arthur MacMillan</strong>. He writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>After paying handsomely to acquire titles of world renown, <strong>Johnston Press</strong> (Scotsman) and <strong>Newsquest</strong> (Herald) have stripped resources to the point where quality journalism is largely impossible. This has resulted in publications unable to pursue their primary function -- to operate as a news medium.</p> </blockquote> <p>In an article for the latest issue of <strong>British Journalism Review</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2008/no3_macmillan\">Scots on the rocks</a>, he claims that the owners have adopted \"a management policy dominated by addressing shareholder concern.\" Meanwhile, the \"tartanised editions\" of the <strong>Daily Mail, The Times</strong> and the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong> are proving more attractive to Scottish readers.</p> <p>MacMillan, who was media correspondent for the Glasgow-based <strong>Sunday Herald</strong> and now works for <strong>Agence France-Presse</strong> in Hong Kong, runs through circulation statistics that show the sales declines of The Scotsman and The Herald. Then he turns to the fall in advertising:</p> <blockquote> <p>A virtual advertising monopoly, in the east for The Scotsman, and in the west for The Herald, has combined with classifieds to ensure huge annual profits and steady returns for shareholders. But the property downturn and the recent decision of Scotland's councils to start their own public-sector-jobs websites has jeopardised this cosy environment. A short-term revenue cycle that bred mind-blowing complacency has been exposed.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overall, it's a penetrating analysis that merits reading.</p>",

  "<p>I yield to nobody in my admiration of the enterprise culture. When a friend visiting the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2008/aug/26/nottinghillcarnival.london?picture=336967712\">Notting Hill Carnival</a> recently lamented the explanation of being charged \u00a33 to use a lavatory in a block of flats to escape the 50-strong queues for the free Portaloos, my response was: \"Good for them.\" </p> <p>When ticket touts charge vast sums for those struggling to attend some prestigious event, my response is that the organisers botched it by failing to charge a market price to start with and thus the corrective in the secondary market is a natural and useful development. </p> <p>For all this, I have doubts as to whether entrepreneurship can be taught in schools. It might make sense to release children from school early - say at 14 years of age - to go on some sort of apprenticeship. Perhaps with the proviso that they must first pass some basic standard of literacy and numeracy. </p> <p>Sending teenagers off to earn money would be conducive to an enterprise culture. But what of the alternative idea that keeping them in school can teach them how to succeed in business? The <a href=\"http://www.enterprise-education.org.uk/home.php\">Enterprise Education Trust</a> is a charity which uses \"business volunteers as role models to inspire young people\". Businessmen are trained to go and teach sixth formers about human resources, market research, design and development, and finance. A programme run by the trust books cinemas around the country for school children to listen to young, local entrepreneurs. The key message is that running a business is realisable. The businessmen might be running a pizza parlour or a coffee bar - it doesn't matter. </p> <p>More relevant is that they went to the same schools and lived in the same streets and have succeeded. EET's chairman, Sir Paul Judge, is <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/education/article4595840.ece\">indignant</a> that money promised by Gordon Brown to be earmarked for such purposes is instead going into general funding. </p> <p>The government announced \u00a350 million would be spent on enterprise education following a review by Sir Howard Davies. \"All secondary schools were sent their \u00a315,000 cheques, but with no formal requirement or way of checking that it was spent on enterprise education,\" says Sir Paul. He adds: \"Not surprisingly, schools under the most acute financial pressure have been the ones where the money has been most likely to have been spent on other things. Often, these are also the schools in the poorest areas \u2013 exactly those areas where Brown wanted to foster and revive the enterprise culture.\" </p> <p>As an example of the government announcing something and it not actually happening in real life it is depressingly familiar. A different point is what good it would have done had the promise been honoured. The trust declares that: \"Many businesses complain that young people are leaving education without the necessary skills.\" </p> <p>True enough but isn't the key complaint the ignorance of the basics? Extraneous subject matter on the curriculum - whether concerning how to have sex or how to set up a business - eats into time which could be spent teaching children to read and write. EET's chief executive, David Millar, feels this misses the point. The business dimension, he contends, enhances learning the basis. Essentially in a maths lesson a group of children whose eyes would be glazing over with boredom suddenly pay attention when it is related to making money. </p> <p>Millar calls the process \"to contextualise the learning\". \"It is particularly the case with disaffected, disadvantaged kids,\" he tells me. Thus an understanding of cash flow projections and balance sheets is inculcated. Critical if they will persuade a bank to give them a start-up loan. Millar says research has shown a shift in attitudes. Research undertaken on behalf of businessdynamics by NOP shows that the number of young people who believe they would eventually like to run their own business has risen from 35% in 2000 to 45% in 2004. </p> <p>There has also been a closing of the gender gap, with more girls keen to become entrepreneurs when they leave school. \"It is now cool to be running your own business with The Apprentice, Dragon's Den and so on,\" says Millar. \"It's not seen as just about making money. Although making money is a good thing. It is also a perception that being self-employed gives your more control over your life than being an employee. So attitudes have moved on from the 1980s Gordon Gekko 'Greed is Good'.\" </p> <p>The National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship is part of the trust's umbrella and assists children to set up \"real sustainable businesses\". They are able to keep the profits and sometimes continue running the businesses when they leave school. I remain a sceptic as to whether a school environment with simulated business scenarios can substitute for the exhilarating reality \u2013 the chaotic, cut and thrust of attempting to make money out of the fulfilment of an idea. But in the age of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/0300122233\">the nudge</a>, perhaps the Education Enterprise Trust are doing something worthwhile.</p>",
  "<p>A year into the global financial crisis, several key central banks remain extraordinarily exposed to their countries' shaky private financial sectors. So far, the strategy of maintaining banking systems on feeding tubes of taxpayer-guaranteed short-term credit has made sense. But eventually central banks must pull the plug. Otherwise they will end up in intensive care themselves as credit losses overwhelm their balance sheets. </p> <p>The idea that the world's largest economies are merely facing a short-term panic looks increasingly strained. Instead, it is becoming apparent that, after a period of epic profits and growth, the financial industry now needs to undergo a period of consolidation and pruning. Weak banks must be allowed to fail or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/01/banking.economicgrowth\">merge</a> (with ordinary depositors being paid off by government insurance funds), so that strong banks can emerge with renewed vigour. </p> <p>If this is the right diagnosis of the \"financial crisis\", then efforts to block a healthy and normal dynamic will ultimately only prolong and exacerbate the problem. Not allowing the necessary consolidation is weakening credit markets, not strengthening them. </p> <p>The United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England are particularly exposed. Collectively, they have extended hundreds of billions of dollars in short-term loans to both traditional banks and complex, unregulated \"investment banks\". Many other central banks are nervously watching the situation, well aware that they may soon find themselves in the same position as the global economy continues to soften and default rates on all manner of debt continue to rise. </p> <p>If central banks are faced with a massive hit to their balance sheets, it will not necessarily be the end of the world. It has happened before \u2013 for example, during the financial crises of the 1990s. But history suggests that fixing a central bank's balance sheet is never pleasant. Faced with credit losses, a central bank can either dig its way out through inflation or await recapitalisation by taxpayers. Both solutions are extremely traumatic. </p> <p>Raging inflation causes all kinds of distortions and inefficiencies. (And don't think central banks have ruled out the inflation tax. In fact, inflation has spiked during the past year, conveniently facilitating a necessary correction in the real price of houses.) Taxpayer bailouts, on the other hand, are seldom smooth and inevitably compromise central bank independence. </p> <p>There is also a fairness issue. The financial sector has produced extraordinary profits, particularly in the Anglophone countries. And, while calculating the size of the financial sector is extremely difficult due to its opaqueness and complexity, official US statistics indicate that financial firms accounted for roughly one-third of American <a href=\"http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2007/11/19/wall-street-bonuses-up-6-to-38-billion-while-its-stock-drops/\">corporate profits</a> in 2006. Multi-million dollar bonuses on Wall Street and in the City of London have become routine, and financial firms have dominated donor lists for all the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/02/12/mccain-received-100000-_n_86245.html\">major political</a> candidates in the 2008 US <a href=\" http://freedomsright.blogspot.com/2007/10/wall-street-big-banks-corporate-firms.html\">presidential election</a>. <br>Why, then, should ordinary taxpayers foot the bill to bail out the financial industry? Why not the auto and steel industries, or any of the other industries that have suffered downturns in recent years? This argument is all the more forceful if central banks turn to the \"inflation tax\", which falls disproportionately on the poor, who have less means to protect themselves from price increases that undermine the value of their savings. </p> <p>British economist Willem Buiter has <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2008/04/if-its-broke-fix-it-but-how/\">bluntly accused</a> central banks and treasury officials of \"regulatory capture\" by the financial sector, particularly in the US. This is a strong charge, especially given the huge uncertainties that central banks and treasury officials have been facing. But if officials fail to adjust as the crisis unfolds, then Buiter's charge may seem less extreme. </p> <p>So how do central banks dig their way out of this deep hole? The key is to sharpen the distinction between financial firms whose distress is truly panic driven (and therefore temporary), and problems that are more fundamental. </p> <p>After a period of massive expansion during which the financial services sector nearly doubled in size, some retrenchment is natural and normal. The sub-prime mortgage loan problem triggered a drop in some financial institutions' key lines of business, particularly their opaque but extremely profitable derivatives businesses. Some shrinkage of the industry is inevitable. Central banks have to start fostering consolidation, rather than indiscriminately extending credit. </p> <p>In principle, the financial industry can become smaller by having each institution contract proportionately, say, by 15%. But this is not the typical pattern in any industry. If sovereign wealth funds want to enter and keep capital-starved firms afloat in hopes of a big rebound, they should be allowed to do so. But they should realise that large foreign shareholders in financial firms may be far less effective than locals in coaxing central banks to extend massive, no-strings-attached credit lines. </p> <p>It is time to take stock of the crisis and recognise that the financial industry is undergoing fundamental shifts, and is not simply the victim of speculative panic against housing loans. Certainly better regulation is part of the answer over the longer run, but it is no panacea. Today's financial firm equity and bond holders must bear the main cost, or there is little hope they will behave more responsibly in the future. </p> <p><em>Copyright: <a hef=\"www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</em></p>"
