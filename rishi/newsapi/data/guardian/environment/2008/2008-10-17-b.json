  "<p>I never imagined that a presentation on Manchester's streetlights would be so interesting. But let me tell you \u2014 there are several different types of streetlight ... OK, I won't bore you with the details but suffice to say, it's more complicated than you think and some of them bend in the middle.</p> <p>I am at Amey's Manchester office, in the suburb of Hapurhey (pronounced Har-perry, not Harper-Hey as I'd said to the taxi driver's great amusement), being shown the ropes by Trevor, the boss, before we head out on a streetlight inspection, bedecked - oh joy - in high-visibility suit and hard hat. </p> <p>With me is Emily Davies, a strapping sort with a quick humour and a ready answer for every question. Davies is currently based in Oxford in the environment and sustainability group of Amey, but who is here to learn about the company's contract to maintain Manchester's streetlighting provision. </p> <p>Amey is responsible for the maintenance and repair of around 56,000 streetlights and 6,150 illuminated signs and bollards throughout Manchester's 900-mile road network.</p> <p>As we sit through the presentation, the 23-year-old from Hertfordshire fervently makes notes and questions. She has already enjoyed a stint in the army on a gap-year commissioned training scheme after a degree in physical geography at Durham University. </p> <p>She started at Amey in September last year and chose it principally because of its leadership graduate programme. \"I was keen to go into the environmental side of things, but with my training in the army I was keen on the leadership element,\" she says.</p> <p>\"It's offered me a chance to experience a number of roles and see much of the company before committing to a career. It has consequently enabled me to travel throughout the UK, which, for me, was also essential in a job.\"</p> <p>Graduates at Amey complete three to five placements within a particular business division (or divisions) over two years, while following a structured development programme, mostly in different parts of the UK. </p> <p>Davies is currently completing a course to become an associate member of the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment as well as undertaking the relevant training for the leadership programme.</p> <p>In her first placement in the consulting division, Davies was involved with a variety of projects, including research into Amey's laboratory capabilities, environmental task proposals, implementation and report writing for railway station re developments, implementation of a green travel plan and marketing of the environment and sustainability business stream. Currently, she's doing research into the waste market and has just coordinated Amey's contribution to the Birmingham Climate Change Festival.</p> <p>For the festival \u2014 which she cites as her personal highlight so far \u2014 she designed a road track for remote-controlled cars in order for the public to practise planning shorter car journeys. She also organised a Top Gear-style event in which she challenged local businesspeople to enter Birmingham city centre by bus, car and bike in rush hour.</p> <p>At the end of the two years, Davies will apply for a job at the company. At this stage she doesn't know where she wants to go but is leaning towards the environmental or operational sides. \"I am very interested in corporate social responsibility and sustainability,\" she says. So far she has worked in Birmingham, Bedford and Oxford but there is talk of Cumbria for her next stint. \"Wherever I settle, it probably won't be for that long,\" she says. \"I imagine I will be up and down the country like a lunatic anyway.\"</p> <h2>Switch on</h2> <p><strong>Amey </strong><a href=\"http://www.amey.co.uk/graduates\">amey.co.uk/graduates</a><br>Deadlines April 1 2009; September 1 2009</p> <p><strong>Skanska</strong> <a href=\"http://www.skanska.co.uk\">skanska.co.uk</a><br>Deadline December 5 2008</p> <p><strong>Ministry of Defence</strong> <a href=\"http://www.mod.uk\">mod.uk</a><br>Various schemes ongoing</p> <p><strong>BP</strong> <a href=\"http://www.bp.com\">bp.com</a><br>Various schemes, see website for deadlines</p> <p><strong>Shell</strong> <a href=\"http://www.shell.com\">shell.com</a><br>Ongoing applications</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday was the 35th anniversary of the night when, for English football, the world stopped turning. Asked to beat Poland at Wembley to qualify for the 1974 World Cup England could only draw 1-1. The repercussions of that fateful evening continue to reverberate even now.</p> <p>The Football League had refused to help Sir Alf Ramsey by postponing the previous Saturday's programme. Challenged on this in a radio interview, Alan Hardaker, the League's redoubtable secretary, protested that \"it is a football match not a war. Everybody is getting hysterical. If we do lose, the game is not going to die. It will be a terrible thing for six weeks and then everybody will forget about it.\"</p> <p>Fat chance. Much of England's present support was not even born when Ramsey's side were eliminated in 1973 yet the result has left a permanent mark on people's perceptions of the national side's status and aspirations in global affairs. The assumption that in 1970 England would retain the World Cup won in 1966 had been roundly and rudely contradicted by West Germany in Le\u00f3n yet the possibility that one day the team would not actually qualify for the tournament proper had not been seriously considered. England might not win a World Cup played beyond Wembley but at least they would always be there to try.</p> <p>Ever since the final whistle was blown on England's increasingly desperate attempts to beat Jan Tomaszewski, Poland's inspired goalkeeper, a second time the efforts of successive managers to qualify for the major tournaments have been accompanied by a degree of angst among supporters and media alike. In the case of Graham Taylor and Steve McClaren the reservations were eventually justified and Don Revie and Kevin Keegan did not hang around in the World Cup long enough to find out. Ron Greenwood, Bobby Robson, Glenn Hoddle and Sven-Goran Eriksson each managed to get England to the World Cup proper and already Fabio Capello looks like joining them.</p> <p>England's present coach is echoing Ramsey in his better years although the Italian's English is marginally superior to to Alf's strangled vowels and misplaced aspirates. Like Ramsey Capello is quick to identify a problem and deal with it successfully, as shown in his readiness to change the roles of Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard to the team's advantage during the qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Belarus. Moreover he appears to command the respect of the players as Ramsey did while keeping a similar distance from them - a master not a mate. </p> <p>Capello also shares Ramsey's belief in the importance of a solid defensive base although he will be lucky to unearth another Gordon Banks before 2010. Ramsey, too, would have been horrified at the space and possession England's midfield allowed Belarus before half-time in Minsk and both coaches' team talks would have amounted to the same thing, the oldest managerial edict in the game: \"Get stuck in!\"</p> <p>There are certain contrasts in approach, not least Capello's dealings with reporters. England's present coach expects to be quizzed about team and tactics and, like so many of the modern ilk, is a master at answering questions comprehensively while at the same time giving little of importance away. Ramsey, who belonged to an older, more introverted school, regarded queries about team matters as an intrusion into his private life.</p> <p>With four straight wins Capello has made a better start to a World Cup campaign than any of his predecessors and in a way was fortunate to take over the England squad in the wake of McClaren's flawed, flummoxed attempt to qualify for this summer's European Championship. Maybe the Football Association believed McClaren, one of the game's NCOs, had a marshal's baton in his knapsack. If so it turned out to be a wand patented by Tommy Cooper.</p> <p>Two tests now await Capello. The first concerns the alacrity with which he picks up the thread of qualifying for South Africa in 2010 when England resume their quest next April Fools' Day against Ukraine. The second, assuming England get there, is how he handles the squad in the tournament proper, a task which exposed Eriksson's inability to act decisively during a game when things began to go wrong.</p> <p>Ramsey was found out in the long run because he did not understand substitutes. That will be the least of Capello's problems but World Cups can make pygmies out of giants and reduce the most hardened and experienced of coaches to helpless bystanders. At least England's latest incumbent has given himself a flying start towards being judged at the highest level.</p>",
  "<p>'Everyone's always very surprised, actually,\" says Becky Evans. \"When they come into the ops rooms they think it's going to be some mad hubbub of craziness.\" And she is right. Arriving at the National Air Traffic Control Centre at Swanwick, I did indeed think that. But it isn't. Instead, a mood of nonchalant tranquillity fills the vast, white chamber below us, from where almost all of the aircraft over England and Wales are being controlled.</p> <p>Casually dressed staff chat calmly in front of their computers. When I am allowed in for a peep, one man is even reading a newspaper in his expensive chair. \"Pensions announcement to be made today,\" promises a large, illuminated screen behind him, while four stuffed animals hang forgotten above everything - suspended from the ceiling years ago, I am told, by some office wag. It all looks rather like the lair of a progressive Bond villain, perhaps during the early consultation stages of his next diabolical scheme.</p> <p>\"It's very quiet,\" says Evans almost gleefully. \"It's a very controlled environment, that's the only way I can describe it. We know when aircraft are going to arrive in the sector, and you know what you have to do with them. And then you pass them on to the next guy.\" It sounds a disarmingly simple way of describing a very complex job.</p> <p>And though Evans seems a master of it now, she only got into air traffic control, quite literally, by accident. All set to join the army after university, she snapped a ligament in her knee and was rejected on medical grounds. While she was looking around for alternatives, a friend who had already begun training as a controller recommended the air traffic service. \"And the more I read about it,\" she says, \"the more I thought, ooh that sounds right up my street.\"</p> <p>So in 1998, aged 21, she headed straight for the College of Air Traffic Control in Bournemouth. And after three years of training, and having passed her final exams, she was ready to start moving real planes. Was she nervous that first time? \"You're probably wanting me to say that it was more of a moment than it was,\" she suggests, accurately. \"But you have been doing this training for such a long time, and during the training you also do periods on the job where you go to a unit or a tower. So it's not like that's the first time you've ever spoken to them on the radio. It wasn't that much of a thing.\"</p> <p>It is still taking me a little time to accept that while hundreds of lives depend on Evans doing her job properly, she has always been perfectly calm about it. \"Everybody thinks it's a really stressful job,\" she says. \"But I don't find it stressful. It's very rewarding and satisfying when you've done it, and you've been sitting there for an hour and a half and it's all gone really smoothly. There are moments of high pressure, but the training that you do is such that you're taught to deal with it. It just becomes second nature, almost.\"</p> <p>In Evans's case, this pressure usually means having to deal with the busy times when there are around 25 aircraft an hour jostling for her attention. In her patch of sky - the area above the south-west of England and the southernmost half of Wales - this happens most often at around 4am, as many flights from America begin descending towards London, and then peaks again from 10am, when another surge of planes heads off west once more.</p> <p>The more dramatic types of pressure, of course, are very rare. Evans reels off a list of different systems each of which is designed to prevent mid-air collisions, and it certainly sounds as if there are enough of them. While other emergencies happen so infrequently that only once, in eight years as an air traffic controller, has she ever had to deal with one. So then, what does happen in an emergency? \"If an aircraft says it's got an engine failure or a decompression or something, then there's nothing you can do about that,\" she says, with what sounds like well-honed realism. \"It's not within your control; you just have to deal with it as best you can at the time.\" </p> <p>Usually, this means clearing everything out of its way so the plane can land as soon as possible. And so it proved in Evans's own emergency. \"There was smoke in the cockpit,\" she remembers. \"A guy that was getting airborne from Bristol, he called me and said 'Pan, pan, pan, pan!' Pan is like a warning. 'Mayday' means big disaster, need to get down immediately, and 'pan' is the next one down. It's not as serious, basically.\"</p> <p>So what happened? \"There was nothing wrong with his aircraft, but he wasn't sure what was going on while there was smoke in the cockpit, so he said, 'I want to land immediately.' And Brize Norton is just there, which has a huge runway. So he took off from Bristol, went up two or three thousand feet, and then landed at Brize. And he was absolutely fine.\" She still cannot resist a little smile at the memory of this comically tiny flight.</p> <p>It is interesting to listen to the way Evans tells this story - about \"him\", as if just one man was involved, when in fact \"he\" was the pilot of a jet full of passengers. It is a reminder that, while other members of her team plan routes and manage traffic flows, her job is fundamentally about talking to people - albeit in the coded language of the skies. \"Speedbird123 climb flight level 300,\" for instance, would mean \"British Airways flight 123, please could you fly up to an altitude of 30,000ft? Thanks awfully.\"</p> <p>Besides this, though Evans has heard every imaginable voice and accent, there is little room for conversation. \"You do have the chit-chat in as much as you say 'goodbye' when they leave your frequency,\" she observes drily. \"And every now and then, if there's a big England game on or something, somebody will pipe up and say, 'If you've got a minute, what's the England score?' Then we have to send one of the boys off to find out so you can tell them. But that is only when it's really, really quiet.\"</p> <p>When it's busy, on the other hand, competition between pilots can be fierce over who gets the best slots, in which they can save the most fuel. As a result, not every one of Evans's conversations is straightforward. \"Sometimes pilots will not realise how busy you are and they will push you for things,\" she shrugs. \"You just have to say, 'No, I can't do that.' So you have to be confident in what you're doing, and be prepared to say no.\"</p> <p>Attempting instead to explain the complexity of her workload, which she shares with two other team members, would certainly be almost impossible. \"I've tried with my mum for hours and never managed it,\" Evans admits. Nevertheless, she walks me over to a map on the wall to have another go. The main transatlantic artery seems straightforward enough, travelling northwest from London over Wales. Around it, she points out numerous smaller airports and subsidiary routes, all of whose climbing and descending traffic have to be mixed together without one plane ever being less than five miles in front of, or 1,000ft above, another. And that includes when a thunderstorm blocks the way. Or if fog suddenly makes an airport unusable. </p> <p>\"And we've got a lot of Manchester departures,\" she continues, slicing a great vertical line through the middle of everything. \"So then you're mixing that in with all those Heathrow departures, and choosing levels in the middle that are going to make them all, erm, miss, obviously.\" She chuckles. But she has not finished.</p> <p>\"Then you've got faster aircraft and slower aircraft. You can't have a slower aircraft with a faster one right behind it doing the same thing. So you tell them to fly to these radar headings to keep them separated.\" Her fingers speedily traverse the map, which is splodged with coloured symbols, as if she were trying to separate all the strands in a bowl of moving spaghetti. </p> <p>When she flies, I can't help but wonder, is she thinking about all this? \"Yes,\" she admits. \"Because it's your airspace, you know ... We went to Barbados last year as a quick last-minute holiday before my daughter was born. We came in through Gatwick, and it was actually really nice, because it was a glorious morning just looking out over the south coast. And of course you know exactly what you're doing ... I was thinking, I wonder who's working? Because obviously everybody who does this bit of airspace I know. You just wish you could go up to the front and sit in the cockpit, and go, 'Hello!'\" Her face falls. \"But it doesn't quite work like that.\" For just a moment, she looks genuinely disappointed.</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Pay </strong>\"A full-time controller who has been working for a number of years can earn about \u00a390,000pa. As I'm part-time, and I'm not at the top of the scale either, I think I'm on a shade under \u00a350,000.\"</p> <p><strong>Hours </strong>\"A full shift pattern is two morning shifts, two afternoon shifts, two night shifts and then four days off. I do two afternoon shifts, a day off, two morning shifts, and then five days off. And then I do it again. Shifts are eight hours, but you can only work a maximum of an hour and a half before you have a half-hour break.\"</p> <p><strong>Work-life balance </strong>Good. \"My husband is also a controller, and we've got a daughter who was born a year ago. So I am now part-time, and my shifts are opposite to Martin's, which means we can do all the childcare ourselves. Which is fantastic, actually.\"</p> <p><strong>Best thing </strong>\"Working as part of a team. And the time off, I really enjoy that.\"</p> <p><strong>Worst thing </strong>\"Getting up really early is not good. And because of the shift work, we do every day of the year. Christmas Day, New Year's Day ... every day is just an air traffic day.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Relationship break-up left a colleague feeling bereft - how can I help?</h2> <p><strong>I run a small business with a small office team and a wide range of freelancers. The first person I employed was a young man who has proved a real boon. I have become good friends with him on a purely work basis. He is highly skilled and has drawn praise from all our clients. However, he is somewhat socially gauche and unconfident. </strong></p> <p><strong>I felt until recently that this was improving and I gave him more responsibility. The problem stems from the acrimonious breakdown of his long-term, live-in relationship, that resulted in personal distress and money worries. I and my colleagues are doing our best to be supportive. He has done his best, though his work has suffered. He is a valuable employee and I hope and believe the problems of poor concentration and exhaustion are temporary. </strong></p> <p><strong>The thing is, his recent experiences have seemed to make him regress and he now appears even more gauche and immature. He has very uncertain body language and cannot even sit up straight - he winds himself round his chair and fiddles with his face. It's starting to irritate me - it doesn't give a good impression and also I feel he needs to sort it out in order to make the best of himself in the future. </strong></p> <p><strong>I worry that this is a far longer-term problem and I can't think that there is a quick fix. I need to improve the situation but I do not want to jeopardise our very good relationship. What can I do for him? Should I offer him training in presenting himself, or in interview technique?</strong></p> <p>I'm more than usually hesitant to give advice when there's a very fair chance that what someone initially needs is a professional consultation. From what you tell me about your colleague, this could well be the case with him. </p> <p>You say you're anxious not to jeopardise your good relationship. From this I infer, perhaps wrongly, that you haven't yet had a proper face-to-face conversation with him. If so, I think you must: ideally out of the office and with plenty of time at your disposal.</p> <p>I'm sure I don't have to tell you of the need for extreme sensitivity and gentleness of approach. I'm not recommending a confrontation or anything like it. You should start with the lightest of suggestions that he might like to speak about himself; it's entirely possible that since the break-up with his partner, he's had no one to talk to. If so, he could be more than ready to open up. On the other hand, if he initially seems to put up the shutters, you may have to increase the pressure a little.</p> <p>But however this conversation develops, there's one quite critical fact you must establish - and that's whether or not he's consulted his GP. And if he hasn't, which seems possible, do please try to get him to promise you he will. You may well think this to be outside your carefully defined professional limits and even intrusive. And so may he. But he clearly needs help and you want to give it. And until he's had the benefit of a proper medical consultation, and has shared the outcome with you, you can't possibly know how to help him most usefully.</p> <p>If you're successful in persuading him to follow this course, the rest may follow more naturally. But I'd quite understand if you felt deeply uneasy at such a level of involvement in someone else's life: you can't just dip in and then out again. </p> <h2>Overwork has ruined my reputation - should I try to repair it or quit?</h2> <p><strong>For the past three years I have been working directly to the senior management team of a recently launched organisation. While the work has been really interesting, my team has been severely understaffed. We have had to work a minimum of 12 hours per day and at weekends. </strong></p> <p><strong>After three years of this I am very stressed and have developed a reputation across the rest of the organisation for being short-tempered and unwilling to take on work. This is not how I want to be perceived. </strong></p> <p><strong>It does look as though there is light at the end of the tunnel. The additional staff members that we were promised over a year ago by the management team should take up their posts shortly, so my staff should be able to reduce their hours. </strong></p> <p><strong>I've been offered another post by a rival organisation which I am keen to take, but in the meantime I want to build relations where I work - at the moment I am physically dreading going into work each day. I would be grateful for your advice on what, if anything, I can do.</strong></p> <p>I have a great deal of sympathy with your predicament. There's another job waiting which you'd like to take but you simply hate the thought of leaving your present company still shrouded with a reputation for being workshy and ratty. You know that's not your natural self; it's the inevitable consequence of three stressed years of overwork.</p> <p>I was originally tempted to advise you to hang on in there, wait for those reinforcements to arrive - and then hope that a much reduced workload would quickly allow you to be widely seen as the equable and conscientious person you naturally are. But the recognition of a cruel truth deterred me: no reputation is reversed overnight. It has to be faced that you'd be lumbered with yours, however unjustly, until a fair proportion of total company staff had turned over. And that could take years. You absolutely mustn't subject yourself to that risk.</p> <p>So hold on just long enough to ensure your team is really going to get the relief they so desperately need. Then double-check the new job to see it's really all you hope for - and then go for it.

  "<p>The American economy hits the skids and sends the global financial market reeling. Within two weeks the country has gone from talking about lipsticks on pitbulls and astronomical petrol prices to hyperventilating about the collapse of an entire set of political and economic assumptions, graven in stone these three decades past. This is an enormous and terrifying hinge-moment in American history: belts have been drastically tightened, the bill has come due and the cupboard is bare. The vacuous political class that is supposed to rescue us from all this is utterly discredited, democracy was long ago strangled by political money, the infrastructure is in tatters, and the national debt looks like we inherited it from Brobdingnag and the Land Of The Giants.</p> <p>And in the three-week period during which all this became painfully evident, the biggest movie in America was Beverly Hills Chihuahua - a live-action Disney dogcom in which a pampered, Paris Hilton-friendly pooch (voiced by Drew Barrymore) reconnects with her earthy canine ancestry when she gets lost in Mexico. </p> <p>Is this how empires fall? Shouldn't the greatest, most melancholy and powerful art came out of societies gripped by inexorable decline? There is nothing more evocative of deep and complicated feelings than to witness the passing away of an entire social order, feelings shared equally by those with the greatest stake in the ancien regime and those most anxious to see it all come down. 1848 begat Flaubert's L'Education Sentimentale, India/Pakistan's partition gave us The Jewel In The Crown and Rushdie's Midnight's Children, the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire yielded up the rich landscape of decline and fall outlined for us by Stefan Zweig, Arthur Schnitzler, Robert Musil, Hermann Broch, S\u00e1ndor M\u00e1rai, Mikl\u00f3s B\u00e1nffy, Gregor von Rezzori and particularly Joseph Roth. And America gives us a bunch of yappy little rat-resembling mutts.</p> <p>I suppose I'm not being fair. The Berlin Wall came down nearly two decades ago and interesting movies about that period and earlier (The Lives Of Others to The Death Of Mr Lazarescu, to name just two) only started arriving recently. The present collapse of all the smelly Friedmanite orthodoxies (which is my Berlin Wall tumbling down - oh joy!) has happened with such dizzying rapidity that clear focus is obviously hard to come by.</p> <p>But what do you suppose was playing at the flicks the night the seas rushed into Atlantis, or as the Lisbon earthquake convulsed the city, or as the Visigoths defiled the palaces of the emperor? The citizens of a declining empire worth the name would be out at the cockfights or the gladiator play-offs while the city burned and the emperor fiddled, or better yet at a orgy, laughing in the face of death. America is supposed to be good at decadence, but judging by Beverly Hills Chihuahua, it's losing its touch on that front. Badly.</p>",
  "<p>The French government is to take sanctions against one of the country's biggest savings banks, the Caisse d'Epargne, after it suffered a \u20ac600m (\u00a3466.6m) loss on unauthorised equity derivatives trading.</p> <p>The finance minister, Christine Lagarde, yesterday ordered an emergency audit of all French banks after the Caisse indicated that a team of four or five traders had exceeded their limits. </p> <p>They were caught out in the panic surrounding last week's stock market crash by what the bank called \"routine control procedures\". The positions were immediately closed, the Caisse said. The traders had been disciplined.</p> <p>Lagarde said she was \"particularly frustrated and depressed\" by this latest incident of unauthorised trading to hit French banks as the country's banking commission began an investigation into the incident.</p> <p>The Caisse, which is merging with Banque Populaire to form France's second largest retail bank and is known as \"the Squirrel\", is the third to be stung by losses caused by rogue traders.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale took a \u20ac4.9bn hit on up to \u20ac50bn of futures positions allegedly run up by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel, while Cr\u00e9dit Agricole last year lost \u20ac250m through a rogue trader based in the US.</p> <p>Lagarde said the government had been informed of the Caisse losses late on Thursday. Ministers had then been steering legislation through parliament to set up the bank refinancing company which has up to \u20ac320bn to guarantee bank loans. It is the latest European government to follow the British lead in bailing out banks in the wake of the credit crunch.</p> <p>Lagarde's comments came after she attended the first meeting of the refinancing company, which is chaired by former IMF managing director Michel Camdessus. France has also set aside \u20ac40bn of capital to inject into any ailing banks but has repeatedly insisted its banks are \"sound and robust\". The Caisse, which was already closing its proprietary trading desk, earlier this month denied reports that it was seeking a \u20ac6.5bn capital injection to offset huge trading losses. </p> <p>In a statement it said: \"In view of the size of its capital base - more than \u20ac20bn - and its substantial liquidity, this loss has no effect on the financial strength of the group.\"</p> <p>It is understood that an assistant of the rogue traders' team leader has been dismissed. Others have been moved to different jobs.</p> <p>The French rogue trading came to light as Charlie McCreevy, EU internal market commissioner, ordered a regulatory crackdown on parts of the opaque $600 trillion (\u00a3346 trillion) derivatives market.</p> <p>Gordon Brown earlier this week urged global action to control the so-called over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading market which accounts for the vast majority of the total market and takes place between two parties off-exchange, largely to limit foreign exchange or interest rate risks.</p> <p>McCreevy, pointing to the surge in credit default swaps (CDS), said the OTC market could cause \"new tremors\" in the fragile market conditions if one of the parties could not meet its liabilities.</p> <p>He indicated that there should be a central clearing house for \"standardised\" derivatives and he could table EU legislation along these lines before the end of the year. </p> <p>\"No one is able to say how these swaps [CDS] will unwind. Regulators have little sight of the potential liabilities that could be building up,\" he said.</p> <p>Separately, Deutsche Bank confirmed that its executive board had agreed to waive any multimillion bonuses this year. The decision affects 10 directors, including Josef Ackermann, the chief executive, who earned \u20ac14m last year.</p>",
  "<p>Legendary investor Warren Buffett has given a resounding vote of confidence to the US stockmarket, saying that now is a great time to \"buy a slice of America's future at a marked-down price\".</p> <p>After global equities suffered another bruising week, Buffett revealed he is now buying US stocks with his own money and predicted shares would \"substantially\" outperform cash over the next decade.</p> <p>Writing in the New York Times, the Sage of Omaha echoed his famous motto: to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.</p> <p>\"Most certainly, fear is now widespread, gripping even seasoned investors,\" wrote Buffett, who has built a reputation for sound investing over several decades.</p> <p>\"To be sure, investors are right to be wary of highly leveraged entities or businesses in weak competitive positions. But fears regarding the long-term prosperity of the nation's many sound companies make no sense. These businesses will indeed suffer earnings hiccups, as they always have. But most major companies will be setting profit records five, 10 and 20 years from now,\" he predicted.</p> <p>On Thursday market volatility hit a record high, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or Vix. This \"fear gauge\" reached 81%, four times its level in the August panic.</p> <p>Five years ago Buffett said derivatives were \"financial weapons of mass destruction\". Subsequent events have proved him right again. In words that could encourage small investors back into the market, Buffett warned that people who hold cash equivalents had opted for a \"terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value\".</p> <p>He wrote: \"I'll follow the lead of a restaurant that opened in an empty bank building and then advertised, 'Put your mouth where your money was'. Today my money and my mouth both say equities.\"</p> <p>The Dow Jones average has fallen some 5,200 points, or 36%, from a peak of 14,164.

  "<h2>UK coal warns of falling prices and production</h2> <p>UK Coal warned yesterday that a combination of reduced production at two of its deep mines and the fall in world prices from $190 a tonne in August to $129 meant results for the year would be significantly below previous expectations. However, it expects to open new seams next year at Kellingley, West Yorkshire, and Thoresby, Nottinghamshire, where production has been hampered by difficult geological conditions. It added that coal prices were still at historically high levels and said that the number of legacy contracts under which it now supplies coal at below market prices was set to fall sharply. <br><strong>Mark Milner</strong></p> <h2>Berlusconi may intervene to save Italy's car industry</h2> <p>Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, yesterday said state aid for industry was \"imperative\" and suggested he would put taxpayers' money into the nation's car industry. His comments came a day after he announced measures to prevent Italian companies falling to hostile foreign takeovers. Commenting on recent moves in world markets, Berlusconi said: \"Until a short time ago, everything was forbidden. State aid was regarded as on a par with mortal sin. Now it is a categorical imperative.\" He said \"there ought not to be any shock\" if thought was given to supporting the car industry. <br><strong>John Hooper</strong> </p> <h2>Threat to car sales sites as Inchcape profits are hit</h2> <p>Car retailer Inchcape warned yesterday the damage to consumer confidence from the global credit crunch would hit its profit this year and next. Sales have fallen in key markets, notably the UK, and Inchcape said it was taking steps to cut costs. Its chief executive, Andr\u00e9 Lacroix, said cost-saving steps would include closing a dozen UK sites and streamlining the head office operation in London, but declined to be drawn on job losses. The company expects the restructuring to cost \u00a355m and to produce cost savings of \u00a350m a year.

Like-for-like revenues across the group rose 5% year on year in the six weeks to October 12. Over the 41 weeks of its financial year so far, though, Rank reported an 8% decline. It said the upturn was also the result of its own actions, such as setting up \"adult gaming centres\" within its bingo halls, allowing it to increase its stock of high-jackpot machines.<br><strong>Chris Tryhorn</strong></p>",
  "<p>The uneasy truce between the government and the opposition over the global financial crisis broke down yesterday as David Cameron, the Conservative leader, attacked the prime minister's economic competence, accusing Gordon Brown of \"irresponsible capitalism and irresponsible government\".</p> <p>After two weeks of cross-party support for the prime minister, the Tory leader said Brown's strategy had \"fundamentally failed\" and accused him of hiding past failures. Cameron said Brown's policies were a \"complete and utter failure\" and tore into an economic policy which, he said, amounted to \"borrowing and borrowing and borrowing\" in the public sector and on the part of individual households.</p> <p>Cameron loosely tried to preserve the appearance of some cross-party unity by insisting his critique was of the prime minister's decade-long record as chancellor rather than the current bank rescue plan which has seen Brown praised abroad. But government sources and Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader interpreted the remarks as the resumption of hostilities.</p> <p>Clegg condemned Cameron's unilateral move, accusing him of returning to the \"Punch and Judy politics\" which Cameron once made great play of rejecting.</p> <p>The Tory leader called off the peace in a speech to Bloomberg in the City of London at breakfast yesterday the morning after the president of the CBI had praised the cessation of party political jousting.</p> <p>Coming on the day Brown used an article in the Washington Post to call the economic downturn \"a defining moment for the world economy\", government sources initially declined to comment officially on Cameron's speech but some allies called it \"student politics\".</p> <p>A Labour source said: \"What we are seeing here is that the Tories have been getting their policies wrong - on Northern Rock, on Bradford &amp; Bingley and on the mortgage market and now they are having to resort to personal attacks. But it's out of touch with the public who want us all to pull together\".</p> <p>Alan Johnson, the health minister, said: \"It's now obvious that the offer of support at this difficult time from Her Majesty's Opposition was an expedient designed to help the Tories through their conference rather than a meaningful attempt to help the British people.</p> <p>\"Real bipartisan politics means supporting such measures and adding your own ideas. Instead David Cameron has demonstrated a palpable inability to offer meaningful solutions at this time.\"</p> <p>Yesterday a poll for the BBC showed that the government's response to the financial downturn was meeting with some positive reception. When asked which political team they would trust more to tackle the economic problems 42% chose Brown and Alistair Darling, up two points from a fortnight ago, while Cameron and George Osborne, shadow chancellor, were down three points at 31%. Clegg and Vince Cable, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, improved their rating, rising two points to 7%. </p> <p>Cameron also criticised the government's economic framework. He said: \"Gordon Brown is hoping that his whirlwind of summitry will mean that we will forget what has come before. Forget that as we enter a downturn, where jobs, home and livelihoods will be lost that he was the one who created this mess in the first place. But I won't forget and the British people won't forget.\"</p> <p>Brown, Cameron said, had only achieved a \"wave of debt-fuelled growth\" in order to pay for Labour's public spending promises. \"The result was a combination of irresponsible capitalism and irresponsible government that has brought us to instability and our present crisis,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The chancellor who prided himself on prudence came to believe that he uniquely in the history of economics had ended the trade cycle and abolished boom and so he ... borrowed and borrowed and borrowed and racked up the biggest government deficit in the developed world.\"</p> <p>The Tory leader denied accusations his party was unable to gain from the government's management of the economy for 10 years because it was ideologically committed to light touch regulation. Of his decision to support the government for two weeks, Cameron said: \"Some people think that this decision - to support recapitailsation - means that we somehow now subscribe to the government's entire economic policy and doctrine. Let me make it crystal clear: we do not.\"</p> <h2>Tories on the record</h2> <p>On regulation</p> <p><strong>George Osborne, 2006 </strong><br>'In an age that demands a light touch, [Brown] offers that clunking fist.

  "<p>French may or may not be \"the most beautiful language in the world\" (Marcel Berlins, G2, October 15), but the reason Rwandans had to speak it in the first place is due to international politics and the outcome of the first world war. In the European carve-up of Africa, Germany acquired Rwanda and Burundi, uniting them as Ruanda-Urundi. Kinyarwanda, itself a beautiful language, still bears witness to that tutelage every time a child goes to \"ishuli\". Germany's defeat in the war left Belgium with territory it had no use for and attempts were made to get the British to negotiate with their Portuguese allies for a slice of the Angolan coast to be added to the Congo. In return the British could have Ruanda-Urundi to be used for the Cape-to-Cairo railway. The British refused to cooperate, the Belgians never got to extend their Congolese coastline and the Rwandans were faced with coping with French and, for a good number of years, Flemish. The Cape-Cairo railway never got built, but negotiations are now in hand for a line from Tanzania to Kigali.<br><strong>Kevin Hartley</strong><br>Stourbridge, West Midlands </p> <p>Marcel Berlins may well regret the global domination of English, but he is wrong to suggest that Rwanda's decision to replace French as its national language was made \"for the sake of a few bucks\".

  "<p>In the words of George Bush, it will take a long time to restore the current chaos in financial markets. In the search for a new order, a number of key players will have to critically examine their responsibilities. Business schools, particularly the global elite, will need to reflect on the role of the MBA and MBAs in the carnage on Wall Street and just how management education has contributed to the mindset that has led to the excesses of the past two decades. They will need to develop a different language and a new narrative to legitimise their function and to overcome their fascination with a particular form of finance and economics. Business schools need to broaden their intellectual horizons, not least by spending more time looking at the lessons of history (Long Term Capital Management, Enron, tulip mania, the South Sea bubble, dot.cons, exotic financial instruments etc). They will need to cultivate an appreciation of the role of the state and of collective action to counter the fixation on markets and individualism (ie greed and selfishness).<br>The preferred job destination of top MBAs has been hedge funds, private equity, investment banking, venture capital and consulting. MBA league tables reflect this to the extent that they are heavily biased to the salary returns that accrue to MBAs who join these \"professions\". It is time to develop a more robust measure of what constitutes effective, sustainable management education.<br><strong>Professor Ken Starkey </strong><br>Nottingham University Business School<br> </p> <p>The present credit crunch is hurting both rich and poor countries.

  "<h2> Hunter king has country's wolves in his sights </h2> <p>Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf says the country's wolf population needs to be reduced. The figurehead monarch, an avid hunter, told Swedish television on Thursday that it might be necessary to allow limited wolf hunting to keep the population from exploding. The Swedish chapter of the animal protection group WWF dismissed the king's comments, saying there was \"no risk of an explosion\" of the wolf population. Green party leader Maria Wetterstrand also criticised the king yesterday, saying: \"The wolf population will probably be extinct before the royal court, unfortunately.\" <br><strong>Associated Press in Stockholm</strong></p> <h2> Putin tests new satnav system on the family dog </h2> <p>Russia's satellite navigation system is not fully operational yet, but it seems to work on prime minister Vladimir Putin's dog.

Then footage broadcast on Russian television showed them trying a collar containing satellite-guided positioning equipment on the Putin's black labrador, Koni. Ivanov said that the equipment went on standby mode when \"the dog doesn't move, if it, say, lies down in a puddle\".

He was fined $100 (\u00a358), given 75 hours' community service and banned from burning any more crosses for his display. But his neighbour Stephanie Blankenship said she and her husband, who is African-American, had had problems with Helson and his housemate before and felt intimidated. <strong>Associated Press in Canton</strong> </p> <h2> Microcredit group given $1.5m humanitarian prize </h2> <p>The world's largest humanitarian prize is to be awarded on Monday to the non-profit-making organisation Brac for helping more than 110 million people, particularly women, with microcredit and basic services.

  "<p>The IRA's former chief-of-staff Thomas \"Slab\" Murphy has been forced to pay up to around \u00a31m to authorities in the Irish Republic investigating his assets. Ireland's Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) yesterday confiscated more than \u20ac630,000 (\u00a3490,000) from the South Armagh republican along with a large sum in sterling. Murphy has been named in court as the IRA's leader in the 1980s and 90s, when the Provisionals carried out devastating attacks on the mainland.</p> <p>Mr Justice Frank Clarke told Dublin high court yesterday he was satisfied the money was the proceeds of crime.</p> <p>The court gave the CAB the orders to hand the money over to the Irish exchequer. </p> <p>The CAB has been investigating Murphy's activities for a number of years. </p> <p>In March 2006 the CAB, police, customs officers and detectives from the fraud bureau and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation raided his home and business premises at Ballybinaby, Hackballscross in Co Louth. </p> <p>It was also the address of Ace Oils Ltd and CAB officers subsequently told the high court that Murphy and his brothers Frank and Patrick had been involved in oil smuggling and money laundering for 20 years. They also removed cash and cheques in black plastic bags. Murphy still faces charges over alleged tax offences. His brothers, Patrick and Frank, have reached tax settlements with the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p> <p>A police spokesman said the settlement was the culmination of a global crime and fraud investigation into the proceeds of crime.</p> <p>\"The proceedings are the culmination of intensive investigations by the Criminal Assets Bureau and the UK's Serious and Organised Crime Agency, he said. \"Both agencies have co-operated extensively, working in partnership to achieve today's outcome.\"</p> <p>Although Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has described Murphy as a good republican and a long-standing supporter of the party's peace strategy, the south Armagh farmer has been named in British and Irish courts as one of Ireland's leading smugglers. </p> <p>Murphy has been accused of amassing a fortune in smuggled livestock, diesel and cigarettes. </p> <p>During joint Irish and British investigations a couple of years ago a huge property portfolio belonging to Murphy was discovered in the UK. It included properties in Greater Manchester and a flat behind Harrod's in Knightsbridge - the London store blown up by the IRA in the early 1980s.</p>",
  "<p>I'd always wanted a loft, perhaps fuelled by watching at an impressionable age films in which they featured. Ten years ago, I got one. The only doors were the front door and the bathroom door. Even the bedroom was separated off with only a mobile shelving unit. It was beautifully designed and everything I ever wanted. I loved it. </p> <p>But within two weeks of moving in, my boyfriend found me crying, crouched on the bathroom floor - the only place of seclusion in the entire flat. Fact one about open-plan living: you don't realise the psychological importance of doors until you don't have any. Even forgetting about privacy for a moment, not being able to slam a door to diffuse a moment of anger does funny things to you.</p> <p>Fact two: having acres of glazing is not easy. It took us two years to save up for the blinds, which, of course, had to be custom-made. I felt constantly exposed. \"Of course you did,\" says anthropologist Kate Fox when I mention it to her. \"It's a primal response to need somewhere to hide.\" The relentless space afforded no pockets of seclusion. I would visit friends and envy them their window seats, their heavy curtains, the small, intimate corners that conventional rooms always seem to afford. I became obsessed with doors.</p> <p>We often feel good or bad about places or particular rooms without sometimes being able to put a finger on why. This isn't really helped by the fact that most of our living spaces are designed for us. \"When it comes to housing,\" says Peter Carolin, former professor of architecture at Cambridge University, \"we've generally lost our sensitivity and awareness of the psychological issues. This is because our houses and flats have become more commodities than homes - 'buy to let' has furthered this trend. We've lost the ability to be shelter makers.\"</p> <p>Carolin's theory is that, when we had to think about building our homes, we had to think through what we needed: to feel safe, sheltered, a fire for warmth and cooking, privacy for sleeping. \"If you watch young children playing houses, you'd find them reflecting all those basic psychological needs.\"</p> <p>Johnny Grey is at the forefront of new research into the relation between human psychological needs and how they are met in housing. He collaborates with neuroscientist John Zeisel, director of the Academy Of Neuroscience For Architecture (Anfa), which was set up five years ago to get architects, designers and scientists to work together to see what makes a house - and us - tick. Zeisel says he thinks this is \"the future of the field. People may ask what neuroscience has to do with house design, but we have an emotional connection - linked to the brain - of what it is to 'feel at home'. When we are happy, a certain endorphin is released, so we need to design homes in order to release that neurotransmitter.\" Some of Anfa's work (most of which is used in institutions - Zeisel is a specialist in Alzheimer's disease) uses electroencephalograms to track the reaction in a person's brain to their environment. </p> <p>Grey, who works with local authorities on social housing, says, \"What has come out of brain research [in this field] is that fundamentally all humans have similar primitive needs.\" He summarises these as \"seclusion and sociability\". More practically, these translate as: long views out of the window. \"We don't feel comfortable unless we know where we are.\"</p> <p>If you have an island in the middle of your kitchen (and Grey recommends you do), make sure it doesn't have sharp edges; they should be rounded. \"Anything that's in your peripheral vision demands more brain action. And something sharp would cause anxiety, however subliminal, because you think of it as something to avoid.\" Grey's key recommendation for the kitchen is \"sociability. Any kitchen activity should happen facing into the room. You shouldn't be preparing food facing the wall - it goes against everyone's instincts. One of the things we've looked at is how hormones work with the brain and how certain activities stimulate certain hormones.\" A prime example is that \"stuff going on behind us increases adrenaline\".</p> <p>Too much counter space in a kitchen, he says, doesn't make us happy, but chaotic. And make sure that any surface where you'll spend a lot of time, say prepping food, has \"cover for your back\". This adds to the feeling of security and is the opposite of the way most houses are designed. \"Tables in restaurants where you can sit with your back to the wall fill up first,\" Grey says.</p> <p>Away from the kitchen, fires - the hearth - make us ridiculously happy. Not rocket science when you think that to most of us fire symbolises warmth, food and sociability.</p> <p>You may find your home too cluttered, but minimalism is not conducive to happiness, either. Claudia Hammond, author of Emotional Rollercoaster, A Journey Through The Science Of Feelings, says, \"Two decades of study have found that most people have a preference for nature-dominated rather than human-constructed landscapes. This could make the hard lines of open-plan modernist design hard to live with, but we have to remember that this applies only to most people, so those who choose it are likely to be a self-selecting group who do like it. A few, though, might think they'll like it and then find the reality harder to live with than they expect.\" </p> <p>Zeisel advises anyone who wants a minimalist interior to think carefully: \"If you decide on a living room that's all white, metal and glass, that will give you a very different emotional effect from one that's all cosy sofas and a fire.\"</p> <p>My desire for window seats and \"gossipy corners\" wasn't entire fancy. In his book, A Pattern Language, the American architecture professor Christopher Alexander argues that window seats are practically necessities, and goes so far as to prescribe the ideal sill height: window sills on first floors should be 30-35cm high, on higher floors about 50cm. This was so you could sit at the window, look out and still see the ground. \"Everyone loves window seats, bay windows, and big windows with low sills and comfortable chairs drawn up to them. These... are not luxuries, they are necessary. A room that does not have a place like this seldom allows you to feel fully comfortable or perfectly at ease. Indeed, a room without a window place may keep you in a state of perpetual unresolved conflict and tension - slight perhaps, but definite.\"</p>",

  "<p>Before 2008, the last people of note to venture over the Vistula from central Krakow to Podgorze were Steven Spielberg's film crew. Auschwitz, 75km away, attracted all the tourists. The district of Podgorze, built by the ruling Habsburgs in the 19th century to rival the city centre across the water, was crumbling, grey and empty.</p> <p>Spielberg set much of his 1993 film Schindler's List amid Podgorze's forgotten remnants: fragments of the ghetto wall, Tadeusz Pankiewicz's pharmacy, and the Schindler factory itself. The film brought Krakow to global attention. The old Jewish quarter of Kazimierz came back to life; then the bar hub around Plac Nowy became as busy as any in Prague or Budapest. Now, five minutes over the Pilsudski bridge by tram, Podgorze itself is where the scene is heading.</p> <p>The new Qubus spa hotel - rooftop panoramic pool and all - stands beside the former Plac Zgody, where Nazis rounded up or massacred many from the adjoining Jewish ghetto. A young Roman Polanski was one of the few survivors. Today's Square of the Ghetto Victims features a permanent open-air installation dedicated to the victims. Nearby stand more new arrivals: an arty cafe, a chic Med-style restaurant, and probably the best bar in all Krakow - no idle boast these days. It is this bar, the Drukarnia, wantonly tatty and bohemian, whose recent relocation from the nightlife nexus of Kazimierz seals Podgorze's status as the new place to be. Filmmakers, musicians, students - everyone gravitates here.</p> <p>By 2009, work will begin on the abandoned Forum Hotel down the river, developing a leisure stretch along the underused waterfront complete with a summer beach.</p> <h2>Cafe Rekawka</h2> <p>A recent addition to the Podgorze scene is this bohemian cafe with a literary feel. Armchairs sit beside a bookcase and vintage typewriter. Peruvian, Hawaiian and Indian coffees are served and sold loose, along with the more familiar Brazilian and Costa Rican varieties. Apple, carrot, spinach or walnut cakes may complement your cup of joe, along with salads, sandwiches and bruschettas. Kids are welcome - there are colouring books and pens.</p> <p>\u2022 Ulica Brodzinskiego 4B (0048 12 196 2002).</p> <h2>Cava</h2> <p>This Mediterranean-themed bar and restaurant opened in September 2007. It's a breakfast-to-bedtime operation, the selection of salamis, cheeses and peppers good for snacking all day long. Snails are the signature dish, done in several styles, enjoyed by the young and well-heeled against a backdrop of Fashion TV and pastiche art. Cocktails, wines from southern Europe and, of course, cava, provide liquid sustenance.</p> <p>\u2022 Ulica Nadwislanska 1 (+12 656 7456).</p> <h2>Drukarnia</h2> <p>With character in spades, the Drukarnia jazz bar is at the centre of Podgorze's recent revival. Just as popular as when it became a landmark destination in Kazimierz, the Drukarnia makes full use of its riverside location, with tables set outside offering the perfect view of sunset over the Vistula. Inside, a longer back bar has been added to cope with the overflow from the scuffed main room covered in black-and-white photographs of Krakow. Regular live jazz acts and DJs provide entertainment in the basement but banter, gossip and lively discussion over new artistic projects are the main pastime here.</p> <p>\u2022 Ulica Nadwislanska 1 (+12 656 6560).</p> <h2>Plac Bohaterow Getta</h2> <p>Former Plac Zgody is the expansive main square set near the Vistula, criss-crossed by trams. Few tourists ventured this far until artists Piotr Lewicki and Kazimierz Latak opened a permanent installation of 70 chairs here in 2005. Nowy Plac Zgody - New Zgody Square - is a moving tribute to the thousands forced to abandon their worldly possessions before being marched to the nearby Plaszow work camp or sent to Auschwitz. At the back of the square, behind a map showing the ghetto landmarks of Podgorze, stands Tadeusz Pankiewicz's pharmacy, since converted into a museum. Principled, non-Jewish Pankiewicz helped many families for whom his business provided a place to meet and organise. Film, personal accounts and other documentation tell remarkable tales of bravery, luck and survival. Pankiewicz's account of the ghetto era provided the two artists with the idea for their installation.</p> <p>\u2022 Pharmacy Museum: Plac Bohaterow Getta 18 (+12 656 5625).</p> <h2>Club Oko</h2> <p>Part art resource, part cafe, the Oko is the most prominent of several small local galleries springing up around Podgorze, attracting a young crowd. A permanent photographic exhibition of local scenes is the backdrop to an intimate interior where art workshops are regularly held. The building stands 100m from the house where Roman Polanski lived as a boy - although no one has thought to put up a plaque.</p> <p>\u2022 Ulica Wegierska 1 (+12 423 5979, <a href=\"http://www.cluboko.pl\">cluboko.pl</a>).</p> <h2>Schindler factory</h2> <p>For most of the year, the original Schindler factory stands abandoned, the black bin bags over the windows a sorry tribute to the man who saved many Jewish lives by employing them during the Nazi occupation. Random exhibitions and concerts here can be memorable, though, most notably September's performances of music by Karlheinz Stockhausen, part of the city's Sacrum Profanum festival set in former industrial spaces. Even when locked, the gates attract a daily number of tourists on the Schindler trail. The future of the factory is still uncertain.</p> <p>\u2022 Lipowa 4</p>",
  "<p>Richard Woods' art adds up to a kind of cultural makeover project. He takes the architectural environment and adds variations of surface disguise: fake marquetry, tasteless wallpaper, faux wood grain, ersatz neoclassical statuary. He runs a particularly sought-after line in pop art floor covering. His theory behind all this </p> <p>is simple enough: \"If you've been shopping and you plonk the bright shopping bags in your house, you suddenly notice the table is different in relation to the bags.\" While Fermynwoods generally focuses on art-and-nature cross-associations, it's prepared here to enclose two newly refurbished Fermyn Woods cottages in Woods' candy-coloured cladding. </p> <p>\u2022 Fermynwoods Offsite, Brigstock, to Nov 2</p>",
  "<h2>Stringy stretchy omelettes</h2> <p>Eggs are obviously sent from heaven for tired parents. Omelettes make great quick dinners, and you can just bung whatever you've got in the fridge into them: peas, ham, onion, mushrooms. Gouda is particularly popular, as it goes stringy when it melts. For some reason, there is nothing as funny, in the whole world, as stringy cheese.</p> <p>According to Elizabeth David, there is one important rule for omelettes : they are the opposite of scrambled eggs in that you cook as fast as humanly possible. In other words, make sure the pan is scalding before you tip in the egg mixture. For cheese omelettes, mix a bit of the cheese into the egg and then tip the rest of the cheese into the centre once the eggs are nearly cooked . For mushroom omelettes, cook the mushrooms in the pan and take them out before you mak e the omelette. Similarly it's worth warming frozen peas through quickly.</p> <h2>Pancakes</h2> <p>You can buy ready-made pancake mix in the shop, or make it yourself. Children love the drama of the whole flipping thing so much, it's quite ridiculous: pancakes for dinner always does feel like a special occasion. Cook up some spinach and stir in some creme fraiche, cheese and salt for a really delicious savoury filling.</p> <p><strong>You need<br></strong>110g plain flour<br>Pinch of salt<br>2 large eggs<br>200ml milk mixed with 75ml water<br>2 tbsp melted butter</p> <p>Sift the flour and water into a mixing bowl, then make a well in the middle and drop the eggs in. Whisk them gently, drawing the flour in as you do so . Start slowly adding the milk/water until it has all been poured in. Whisk until the batter is smooth. Get the pan really hot, then turn the heat down, melt a bit of butter and pour in a ladleful of batter. Flip over when you see bubbles in the batter, and after a few seconds, take out and serve.</p> <h2>Quick veg pie</h2> <p>You need: frozen puff pastry, a beaten egg, some grated cheese and whatever vegetables you have in the fridge. This works particularly well with leeks, broccoli, mushrooms, courgettes. Slice the veg and cook in a bit of melted butter over a very low heat . Then tip out on to one half of the opened out pastry. Sprinkle with grated cheese , paint egg around the edge of the pastry and then fold it over. Paint more egg all over the top and gently snip holes in the pastry to allow it to breath. Cook for 30 minutes at 200C (400F, gas mark 6). </p> <h2>Fajitas</h2> <p>Children love DIY food, and nowhere is it done better than Mexico.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>Flour tortillas<br>Olive oil <br>Onion <br>Mushrooms and garlic (all chopped finely) <br>Red pepper and chicken sliced into long strips <br>Cumin<br>75ml of chicken or veg stock<br>Red peppers<br>Grated cheese<br>Baked beans<br>Slices of avocado<br>Shredded lettuce<br>Tomato sauce.</p> <p>Soften the onions in olive oil, add the mushrooms and then the garlic, then chuck in the red pepper, the chicken and the cumin and fry for a few minutes. Drop the chicken and increase the mushrooms for a delicious vegetarian version. Then add the stock and let it simmer while you heat the baked beans through.</p> <p>If you've got a gas hob the quickest and most tasty way to heat the tortillas is to put them directly on the flame: turn them quickly with tongs or two forks until they're crispy. A bit of blackening just adds to the smoky flavour. Then just let the kids pile what they like in: the joy of making their own dinner often tempts them into adding all sorts of things they wouldn't normally touch.</p> <p>Tip for folding: line the ingredients down from top along the centre, then fold a flap of tortilla up from the bottom. Then wrap the sides over: this stops everything falling out.</p> <h2>Homemade pizza</h2> <p>Pizza is the greatest. And children love making their own - all you need is a base, some kind of sauce and the topping of your choice \u2026</p> <p>There are several techniques, of varying quickness. Quickest of all is to use the readymade bases they sell in the supermarkets (you can also use those flour tortillas which make lovely small crispy pizzas, perfect for everyone to make their own).</p> <p>Or, best of all, you can make the bases from scratch. This involves a lot more time at some point but then you have them in your freezer and just whip them out when needed.</p> <p><strong>Possible toppings<br></strong>Tomato sauce or ketchup<br>Mozzarella and/or cheddar<br>cheese <br>Mushrooms and ham <br>Olives and tuna <br>Peppers from a jar <br>Salmon and creme fraiche</p> <h2>Pasta bake</h2> <p>You can put any old leftovers into this: it's a kind of dustbin of a dinner, except that makes it sound unappetising. Sorry.</p> <p><strong>You need<br></strong>Pasta<br>1 large tbsp flour<br>2 tbsp butter<br>2-3 large handfuls grated cheese (cheddar, parmesan \u2014 you can mix up what you've got)<br>275ml milk<br>Vegetables - courgettes, cabbage, spring onions, beans, peas, carrots, asparagus - whatever you have to hand<br>Breadcrumbs</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190 C (375F, gas mark 5). Cook the pasta and drain . Put the pasta and veg into a baking dish together. Make the cheese sauce: melt the butter with the flour and stir until it forms a paste then slowly stir in the milk (this is slightly easier if the milk is already a little warm), letting it thicken as you do so. Once all the milk is in, take it off the heat and put in half the cheese. Pour it over the pasta and veg, and scatter the rest of the cheese with some breadcrumbs on top. Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes until golden brown.</p> <h2>Sausage and beans</h2> <p>Tell them this is what cowboys have for dinner. Children really seem to fall for that stuff.</p> <p><strong>You need<br></strong>Olive oil<br>Sausages ( 2 per child)<br>1 onion (finely chopped)<br>1 400g can cannellini beans<br>1 400g can tomatoes<br>1 tbsp black treacle or golden<br>syrup or dark brown sugar <br>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce </p> <p>Fry the sausages in the oil in a heavy-based frying pan, then take them out while you cook the onions in the sausage juice until they're golden. Add the beans (rinsed), tomatoes, treacle/syrup/sugar, the Worcestershire sauce and 150ml boiling water. Cook for a few minutes and then put in the sausages and bring to one glorious crescendo!</p> <h2>Beans and pesto</h2> <p>Canned beans are a great base for a quick meal. Adapt some of the pasta sauces to stir in with them, such as that old favourite - pesto and potatoes.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>2 medium potatoes (peeled and diced)<br>2 tins of your favourite beans (perhaps not kidney)<br>A bit less than half of one jar of ready-made pesto, or some of your home-made<br>50g butter<br>1 tbsp olive oil</p> <p>Cook the potatoes and about five minutes before they are done, add the beans, washed of all their tinny juices. Drain and put veg aside. Put the pan back on the heat, mix the butter, olive oil and pesto until it all sizzles, then gently tip back the beans and potatoes and give a stir. Serve up with grated cheese.</p> <h2>Fried fish</h2> <p>We often forget what fast food fish can be, and a fried fillet of white fish - cod, haddock, plaice - is the simplest, quickest way to get it into your children. Just pat both sides of the fish with flour, put some butter in a pan and put the fish in: it takes between five and 10 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillet. You can check by gently pulling it apart: if all the translucency is gone it's done.</p> <h2>Chicken drumsticks</h2> <p>The nicest way to cook drumsticks is to make up a mix of Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce and tomato ketchup, plus whatever else you have to hand, and then roll the m in it and stick them into a pan and into the oven for half an hour. You'll need to turn them occasionally.</p> <h2>Lamb keema </h2> <p>This is a really easy way to introduce your child to very mild curry flavours.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>1 tbsp veg oil<br>1 onion<br>2 garlic cloves<br>500g minced lamb<br>1 400g tin tomatoes<br>1/2 tsp mild chilli powder<br>1/2 tsp cumin<br>1 tsp ground coriander seeds<br>1 tsp turmeric<br>200ml coconut milk</p> <p>Heat the oil in a large heavybased saucepan, then put in the onion and cook it quickly, stirring to make sure it doesn't catch, unti l it's translucent. Add the garlic and stir. Put in the mince and stir until it browns. Add the spices, then the tomatoes and coconut milk . Simmer for half an hour, then serve with rice.</p> <h2>Vegetable curry</h2> <p>Incredibly easy, and brilliant way of finishing off the veg in the fridge. Use whatever's to hand, there are very few vegetables that don't thrive in this dish.</p> <p><strong>You need<br></strong>Vegetable oil<br>1 onion or 2 shallots<br>1 garlic clove<br>1 small celeriac<br>2 tbsp mild curry paste<br>A few cardamom pods<br>Assorted vegetables (red or green peppers, potato, sweet potato, pumpkin, cauliflower, courgette, broccoli, green beans, peas, okra - what ever you've got in the fridge \u2026)<br>250 ml greek yoghurt</p> <p>Heat the oil in a pan, then add the onion, garlic and pepper if you're using any. Cook for a minute or two, then add the celeriac and some salt and pepper . Give it a couple of minutes, then add the curry paste, the cardamom and some of your vegetables (you have to use your judgment here: the more solid veg should go in first, while the veg which have more affinity with water and which will just mush away if they're cooked too long go in later, after you've got the whole thing properly bubbling). Stir again and let the vegetables sweat in the curry paste a little, then tip in the tomatoes, add a can full of water, and bring it all the boil. After that add the quickcookers and give the whole thing about 10 minutes, until the veg are tender.</p> <p>Serve with rice, plain yoghurt, and naan heated through. You could also make some lass i : just pour some plain yoghurt into a blender, along with a good splash of milk, a pinch of ground cardamom and cinnamon. Sweeten to taste with caster sugar . You can add fruit too - mango or banana are particularly lovely.</p>",

  "<p>The UK's ethical banking sector is not only surviving the meltdown, it is experiencing new levels of consumer confidence and investment. At Bristol-based Triodos Bank, profits are up more than 50%, inflows into its cash Isa are up 25%, and the amount of money deposited by savers is up by 15% - nearly four times the mainstream bank saving rate of 4%.</p> <p>So why are Triodos, and other ethical institutions, bucking the trend? \"We operate a transparent and easy-to-understand business model,\" explains UK managing director, Charles Middleton. </p> <p>\"We raise money from individual savers to fund projects that benefit people and the environment. We don't invest in any of the complicated bundled investments, such as derivatives, that aren't connected to the real economy, and we show exactly what we are investing in.\"</p> <p>But people nervous about banks with overseas parent companies following the collapse of Icesave, should be aware that Triodos is a subsidiary of a Dutch banking group. If it were to go bust, savers would have to apply to the Dutch deposit guarantee scheme. However, this recently raised its maximum payout threshold to \u20ac100,000 (\u00a377,700) - significantly more than the \u00a350,000 offered to UK savers.</p> <p>The Ecology Building Society, which only provides mortgages for properties that have a positive environmental benefit, has seen the amount deposited this year already exceed amount for the whole of 2007. </p> <p>\"We are witnessing a flight to safety, with people increasingly recognising that the mutual model is less affected by the current volatile market,\" says Paul Ellis, its chief executive. </p> <p>The Co-operative Bank has also been able to weather the storm, thanks to \"a historically prudent approach to lending and a strong reputation for trust\". It says: \"Our lending capital is generated from customers' investments and savings, leaving us a good deal less exposed to the markets ... we actually increased mortgage business during the first half of 2008.\"</p> <p>The Co-op Bank says people's money will never be used to support regimes that abuse human rights, and that on the positive side, \"it will always be invested according to sound environmental principles\".</p> <p>It has also seen significant increases in savings balances during the first six months of the year; retail savings have grown by more than 11%.</p> <p>But there is a price to be paid for this prudence, and for knowing your money is not supporting unethical practices such as the arms trade or tobacco, and this often takes the form of lower rates. With a rate of 3.85%, Triodos's online cash Isa isn't the best return you can get. At the Ecology, you will get 5.1% if you take out its Earthwise cash Isa; this rate includes a 1% annual interest bonus payable if no more than one withdrawal is made during the tax year. The Co-op Bank, meanwhile, has some good deals, including a one-year fixed-rate savings bond paying 6.5% gross, and two- and three-year bonds paying 6.59% (the minimum deposit is \u00a32,000). </p> <p>However, a recent poll for Triodos found that 38% of consumers would be prepared to take a lower rate in return for a sound ethical and environmental policy.</p> <p>So what lessons do these banks think their battered and bruised high street competitors need to learn from the whole experience? </p> <p>Paul Ellis believes that the fundamental problem at the root of the crisis \"is a lack of transparency surrounding the complex financial products that have caused so much damage\". </p> <p>Charles Middleton agrees: \"The credit crunch is making people think hard about what their money is doing and what their bank is using it for.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is hardly surprising that Ruby Lennox, the narrator of Kate Atkinson's Behind the Scenes at the Museum, should, aged 17, fantasise about her own funeral - the open coffin strewn with flowers, a church filled not just with friends and family but also \"an admiring Leonard Cohen and a soulful Terence Stamp\", and with Maria Callas singing. (It is 1968.) For the novel, which is her story of her family, has more deaths than even Dickens would have dared include. \"As a family, we are genetically disposed towards having accidents.\"</p> <p>Ruby is an all-seeing narrator. In numbered and dated chapters, she narrates her life, in the present tense. In alternating sections - \"Footnotes\" - she recovers episodes from the lives of her forebears. The high mortality rate in these parts of the novel is perhaps historically unsurprising: golden-haired Ada, who would have become Ruby's great-aunt, dies of diphtheria at 12, like many a Victorian child; in the Edwardian age, grandmother Nell's sweetheart Percy is proposing to her in one paragraph, and dead from a ruptured appendix in the next.</p> <p>History is a blackly comic trickster. Frank, the narrator's grandfather, who survived the first world war, perishes when a German plane, having overshot the York railway yards, dumps its bombs on him as he takes a shortcut down an alley. \"Bad luck because it hadn't been aiming at Frank at all, of course.\" </p> <p>The narrative insouciance makes calamities tragi-comic. For while the characters may be mystified by events, the narrator always knows how things happen. (She cannot fail to tell us that the German plane was shot down soon after and its crew were buried in the same cemetery as unlucky Frank.) When Jack, fianc\u00e9 of the narrator's grandmother Nell, gets a safe posting during the Battle of the Somme, training dogs for special missions, you know that fate will deal some ironical card. Sure enough, having become sentimentally attached to one particular dog, he is killed when he leaves his trench to try to rescue it after it is wounded.</p> <p>Some deaths are comically histrionic. Ruby's father, an incorrigible but inept womaniser, dies the death he might have wished, a coital coronary as he couples on the floor with one of the buffet waitresses at a family wedding. Ruby catches his last moments, and his last words on earth: \"Oh bloody bloody Nora!\" It is summer 1966 and, as she and the waitress realise that he is \"not in a stupor of satisfaction\", Kenneth Wolstenholme's voice echoes from the hotel television. </p> <p>Deaths are constantly foretold. We are told of Ada's sad demise several chapters before it happens. When we hear about Nell's elder brother Lawrence running away to sea, the narrator cannot resist telling us that, after two decades of travel and adventure, he will be blown up by a German mine in the North Sea \"just as the English coast was sighted\". In the very first chapter Ruby is telling us how her sister Gillian, born after the second world war, represents to their parents \"the promise of the future\" when she interrupts herself with a parenthesis: \"(Not much of a future as it turned out, as she gets run over by a pale blue Hillman Husky in 1959 but how are any of us to know this?)\" </p> <p>One hundred and fifty pages later, this death foretold actually takes place, on Christmas Eve, in a chapter beginning \"Gillian's last day\". Gillian is run over leaving the Christmas pantomime, at which she has taken to the stage as a singing volunteer from the audience. \"Really, she is a one, our Gillian,\" comments one of the family party. \"Not for much longer,\" adds the narrator, with the funny-cruel benefit of hindsight.</p> <p>As Ruby recalls her sister's death, she remembers and adopts the blackly unsentimental manner of her childhood self. She and her other sister, Patricia, look at the Christmas tree and wonder silently how Gillian's presents might be reapportioned. Ruby's coolness in her manner of narrating the novel's deaths is one reason why the novel is funny rather than mournful. But this coolness also has an explanation. A family saga will always have revelations, and near the end of Atkinson's novel we find that not every death has left her protagonist unshaken. There is a secret to be revealed that is not comic at all.</p> <p>\u2022 John Mullan is professor of English at University College London.

  "<p>Sarah Thornton guides us through seven different scenarios in the contemporary art world: an auction, an art school, an art fair, an art prize, an art magazine, an artist's studio and an art biennale. We learn what's in everyone's offices and studios and what they eat for lunch (salad in the Turner prize inner sanctum where the jury meet to decide the winner). The nosiness is compelling. Thornton is a camera.</p> <p>Unfortunately, she's not a seer, she's without a vision of how things could be different. Like the art world itself, she assumes only a loser would challenge the system. I'm not saying it isn't a fun read. The reporting is amazingly thorough. But where's the attitude? </p> <p>In New York the publishers of Artforum chat up a storm without revealing anything important about the business they're in. Sometimes this seems to be because they're a bit snaky and sometimes because they really do have the innocence of Winnie the Pooh. When Tony Korner tells Thornton the last thing Artforum would ever do is follow the market, he's being a bear with little brain. He believes what he says. But you'd expect Thornton to tell us where logic falls down in this account of an art magazine that's sometimes two inches thick with expensive ads paid for by the same galleries whose shows are reviewed in its pages. She doesn't do it because she's in the business of taking art world people very, very seriously.</p> <p>Back in London an installation by a Turner prize artist that deconstructs reality TV, and mixes obscurity with mawkish sentimentalism, as much current conceptual art tends to do, is described as \"moving\" and \"subversive\". At least we rarely fail to hear what people are wearing and what their hair is like. \"Buddy Holly glasses\" on curator Matthew Higgs, \"only light mascara\" on Turner prize-winner Tomma Abst, a \"no-nonsense white shirt hanging loose over an Agn\u00e8s B skirt\" on women's studies lecturer Leslie Dick.</p> <p>I was gripped (for the wrong reasons) by the chapter on Japanese artist Takeshi Murakami, whose global operation is like Ruskin's worst nightmare - capitalism that not only destroys the soul but also creates a new world in which having a soul is the equivalent of being born a leper. The work is cartoon pornography - manga clich\u00e9s - in the form of paintings, sculptures and prints, plus a Louis Vuitton bag. Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, the multi-billionaire art collector who has a private museum in Venice and owns Vuitton, has commissioned some cartoons on a vast scale from Murakami. The work is stalled for technical reasons. Solemnity marks the moment. Thornton reports a line of Murakami's business people - \"Takeshi being late for Pinault is like Michelangelo being late for the Pope!\" - as if it were a real thought instead of hysterical sales-talk.</p> <p>In a chapter on the Turner prize, she writes that \"the press never tires of the question 'Is it Art?' and finds it impossible to resist sex jokes\". On the same page she makes two sex jokes herself; describes a Tate curator's outfit in sexist terms; and then goes on to deny the seriousness of half of Rebecca Warren's Turner prize-entry sculptures by calling them \"more pre-school than art school\". It's an odd moment. You want her to be far more undermining, but when a bit of contempt gets out accidentally it's jarring. </p> <p>Thornton has a BA in art history and a PhD in sociology, and she says she takes an anthropological approach to her material. And yet the style of Seven Days is indistinguishable from standard middlebrow journalistic reporting - description mixed with interviews, both oiled with regular chatty interventions. These have two modes. A bit brassy: Thornton suspects Warren's boots are \"just one pair in a considerable collection of trophy footwear\". And light Dickensian: summarising the repressed minimalism of Nicholas Serota's desk, she quips: \"paper is evidently forbidden to accumulate into a stack\". </p> <p>Thornton doesn't deconstruct Serota's performance in his interview but lets us know in an ethnographic, David Attenborough near-gorilla whispering that she's thrilled to be in his office. (He wears a \"muddy asparagus-green tie\".) The scene stands out in the book because so many of the other players imitate loony Californian-speak or actually are Californian, while Serota is incredibly British. It's a hoot to witness him dodging feminist flak from Thornton, stitching up the other members of all the Turner prize juries over the years for the low chick-count among the prizewinners; not to mention making it absolutely clear that the jury would never remotely consider taking nominations for the prize from the ordinary public, while somehow sounding as if he's saying the exact opposite.</p> <p>Curators on a perpetual global party circuit who think of themselves as edgy thinkers; pampered artists desperate to be awarded the Turner prize whose installations are supposed to be about profound anarchy - Thornton gets to the heart of the problem of art-culture, which is that art has become trivial, whereas in previous eras it had some dignity. But she's too wrapped up in playing a role to realise it: she doesn't nail the problem but acts it out, and so ends up perpetuating it.</p> <p>\u2022 Matthew Collings's This Is Civilisation is published by 21 Publishing</p>",
  "<p>The billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch yesterday railed against British regulators for dealing a \"huge injustice\" to BSkyB over a potentially costly row surrounding the broadcaster's minority stake in its rival ITV.</p> <p>Speaking at the annual meeting of his News Corporation empire, Murdoch attacked the Competition Commission for ordering BSkyB to cut its 17.9% stake in ITV to less than 7.5%.</p> <p>\"The purchase of those shares in ITV was totally within the law,\" said Murdoch. \"It's a huge injustice that Sky has suffered and it's still subject to court review.\"</p> <p>The commission decided last year that BSkyB's substantial interest in ITV was anti-competitive and against the public interest. The ruling was backed by the former business secretary John Hutton and was upheld by an appeals tribunal last month.</p> <p>Murdoch told investors that BSkyB ought to be able to own up to 20% in the broadcaster, citing a ceiling imposed by the 2003 Communications Act. </p> <p>He said the issue had been \"parked up with various quangos and committees\" and was not yet final. BSkyB is considering whether to take the issue to the appeals court.</p> <p>BSkyB bought the stock for \u00a3940m two years ago to foil a takeover of ITV by Virgin Media. It has been forced to write down the value of the investment by \u00a3660m because of a plunge in ITV's share price and BSkyB executives are reluctant to sell at a depressed price.</p> <p>Addressing shareholders at New York's Hudson theatre, Murdoch delivered a gloomy assessment of the global economy, acknowledging that the credit crunch has \"weakened advertising markets and beaten down our share price\".</p> <p>He said that News Corp's diversified interests and strong balance sheet left it well prepared for a downturn but added: \"2009 may be a year of unprecedented challenges - we cannot fool ourselves into pretending otherwise.\"</p> <p>There was little dissent among the 50 or so investors present, except for a question over the appointment to News Corp's board of Natalie Bancroft, a 28-year-old opera singer, to represent the Bancroft family which sold the Wall Street Journal to Murdoch last year.</p> <p>An Australian shareholder activist asked if the meeting could hear from Bancroft on \"what values she adds to the board\", while another investor questioned whether she would stand up to her all-male, middle-aged boardroom colleagues.</p> <p>Murdoch replied that Bancroft, who lives in Europe, had already visited all branches of the company: \"She's one of the most diligent new directors I've ever seen.\"</p> <p>Bancroft said that her age was a strength: \"I'm young - this is a company driven by a younger market. I think I bring a youthful perspective.\"</p> <p>She declined to say how much time she was devoting to News Corp: \"I'm not calculating it in terms of days per month. I'm spending time on both of my jobs.\"</p>",
  "<p>High in the French Alps, above Nice and the southern ski resorts, an elderly shepherd is allowed to stay in the rubble ruins of an old army barracks while his sheep graze on the mountainside in the warmer months. An eagle floats regally above a nearby peak. This is the top of the Mercantour national park, a deserted mountainous area that is one of France's last patches of near wilderness - and so well kept a secre, that wolves have crossed over the nearby Italian border and started to breed again. </p> <p>But its serene mix of peaks and lakes has now become the backdrop for a bitter row over rambling. Plans for a \u20ac20m (\u00a316m) footpath and plush lodges, which would catapult the Mercantour from a little-known corner of the Alps to a beacon of international rambling \"prestige\", has sparked controversy. Local politicians and park leaders are scrambling to contain the trekking wars. </p> <p>On one side is one of France's most debonair political figures, Christian Estrosi, a former motorbike champion. As well as being mayor of Nice, he is an MP and the head of the Alpes Martimes region. Dubbed \"Sarko boy\", Estrosi is a friend and political lieutenant of the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and shares his belief that trendy policies and showbiz glitz are crucial. He swiftly appeared at Nice's main hospital to congratulate the actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie on the birth of their twins. </p> <p>Having served twice as a minister alongside Sarkozy, Estrosi is determined to use his recent election in Nice to boost France's fifth biggest city. He knows that a city with one of the biggest urban votes for Sarkozy has sway among the national centre-right ruling party. </p> <p>So while his president is pushing a new green agenda, Estrosi has decided to not only plot Nice's battle to become France's greenest city, but to include the nearby mountains in his plans. </p> <p>The Mercantour, which straddles the Italian border and is barely an hour and a half's drive from Nice, has the richest diversity of flora and fauna in France. His dream is to turn the French side of the park into a centre of \"international prestige trekking\" that would rival the Mont Blanc circuit. But he did not count on the outrage that the plans to renovate paths and build state-of-the-art accommodation for the 87-mile (140km) route would produce. An assorted group of walkers, mountain climbers, forest workers and Alpine bloggers have declared war, opening a debate on ramblers' obligations to the environment. </p> <p>When work started in late summer on a new five-mile stretch of the path between two isolated lakes, local mountain lovers mobilised. Some trekked four hours into the mountains to protest, laying out their rucksacks to read \"non\". Then a group descended on Nice with banners, calling it a battle for the soul of the Alps. Now two local park workers have launched court proceedings over the destruction of examples of rare species of old maritime Alpine plants during what they called the brutality of building work using dynamite and diggers hauled in by helicopter. </p> <p>\"It's James Bond,\" said Vincent Kulesza, the forest ranger, as he stood at 2,000 metres surveying the landscape. \"Politicians don't know what real nature is, they do everything too quickly, submitting the landscape to their caprice.\" </p> <p>The regional government, keen to limit this image of ploughing through land, said the path will shrink back to 60cm to 80cm wide in a couple of years, and promised more consultation.</p> <p>But with summer tourism in the mountains in decline, others wonder who will use the new route. </p> <p>Laurence Roussol, of the non-profit group Mountain Wilderness, said it was vital the path did not just skim the top of the mountain as a high-altitude ramble, but dip into the valley villages to keep life going there. It shouldn't just be a \"jewel for city people at the weekend\". </p> <p>The group is now in consultation on the plans but could get \"radical\" if they feel the environment is at risk, he said. </p> <p>Eric Teisseire, an architect and regular mountain climber, said he feared \"political ambition\" had been \"dumped on the back of the national park\". He remembered the creation of the park in 1979, specifically to protect a slim strip of mountains from the concrete onslaught of ski-resort building. To go back on that and start putting economics before environment by commercialising the park would be \"abhorrent\", he said. </p> <p>Pierre Commenville, a deputy director of the Mercantour national park, said the strength of opposition to the plans \"shows how attached the people are to an area like this, how conscious people are of the mountains\". He admitted that some plants from rare, protected species had been destroyed in the work this summer but said the environmental impact would be strictly monitored. </p> <p>Others are hoping that if the plans follow proper environmental rules, there could be a rambling transformation. Pierre Schropff, an alpine guide, said: \"It's an extraordinary idea that will make the mountain accessible not just to an elite of mountain climbers but to motivated ordinary tourists as well.\"</p>",
  "<p>There's a rabbinic quote about wealth and possessions that I've never really understood. It reads: \"There are four types of person: one who says 'what is mine is mine and what is yours is yours' - this is the average type. One who says 'what is mine is yours and what is yours is mine' - that is an ignoramus. One who says 'what is mine is yours and what is yours is yours' - this is a righteous person. One who says 'what is yours is mine and what is mine is mine' - that person is wicked.\"</p> <p>I also don't understand very much about global finances, but it seems to me that our economic wellbeing has been governed by a system - and people - who largely fall into the second category: ignoramuses who say what's yours is mine and what's mine is yours. They pass around large and often imaginary sums of money that don't belong to them and lend it to other people, who then find themselves unable to give it back. Quite what the consequences of this are going to be for our world remains to be seen, but it is already clear that something very dramatic - alarming even - is taking place all around us that could yet have drastic effects on our society and on each of us as individuals.</p> <p>A question for a rabbi at this time - or, indeed, at any time - is how to find a spiritual dimension to any secular one in which the community might find itself. As we celebrate the seven-day festival of Sukkot (the feast of tabernacles), which began on October 14, the answer lies perhaps in the symbolism of the fragile structure from which the festival takes its name. Once a year our tradition bids us to construct a temporary shelter (sukkah) made of branches and leaves, and decorated with fruit. This serves to remind us both of the abundance of nature, for which we should be grateful, and of our dependence on it, of which we should take note. We have seen plenty of examples of nature's potential cruelty, and we would do well to remind ourselves of the extent to which our lives are at the mercy of those powerful forces by taking a moment to stand in the sukkah and look through its roof at the distant stars while feeling the wind, the cold and the rain around us.</p> <p>And we are seeing also the manifestation of another of nature's cruel aspects: the greed and folly of human nature. A society built on the acquisition of material possessions, constructed around the beliefs of those who tell us that it is possible to buy now and pay later; that what's theirs is ours and what's ours is theirs - but please can they have what's theirs back now. But we can't give it back because it was never ours in the first place.</p> <p>What we do have, and what we need to rediscover, are the values of community - social capital - that have underpinned human development throughout the ages, even as our greedy economic system has run away with itself and carried us along with it in more recent times. As our human nature has driven us to seek the acquisition of ever-greater quantities of riches and possessions, so it has blinded us to the more profound qualities that are available to us. \"Who is wealthy?\" ask those same rabbis who might now be shaking their heads at the folly of an economic system run by ignoramuses. \"Someone who is satisfied with what they have,\" is their reply.</p> <p>While I do not wish to understate the impact the current financial and economic situation will have on so many individuals within our society, it is perhaps an opportunity to remind ourselves of the wealth of social capital that we have at our disposal. Proper investment and use of this type of capital will encourage the growth of community that can never be fostered by the current economic system. If we look towards one another in our communities, rather than relying on financiers and the market to shape and guide our lives, we can replace greed with mutual support, fear with trust, and the despair that seems to lie ahead with hope and confidence for a richer future.</p> <p>\u2022 Pete Tobias is the rabbi at the Liberal Synagogue Elstree</p>",
  "<p>A grey October's afternoon in Manchester, the grinding routine of training is over for another day and Micah Richards is playing a game that everyone connected with his football club has probably had a go at over the last few weeks - the which-player-would-we-like-next game. Ronaldo or Ronaldinho? Kaka or Messi? Villa or Torres? It is a long list of the super-rich and super-talented and Richards, eyes sparkling, needs a few seconds to make up his mind. \"Thierry Henry,\" he eventually announces. \"That's one cool dude.\"</p> <p>The stuff of fantasy? Maybe, maybe not. There is so much money swilling around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity\">Manchester City</a> these days it would not be the biggest shock in the world. On the flipside it could also be argued that the club's young English footballers should be watching with as much concern as awe. Yet Richards, alone, should ensure Mark Hughes never has to field a team made up exclusively of foreign players. Among the Brazilians and other assorted nationalities it is inconceivable that there will be no place for the boy from inner-city Leeds who played his first game for England at the age of 18 and 144 days and had Sir Bobby Robson talking of him becoming \"our best defender since Bobby Moore\".</p> <p>Richards himself is engaging company - polite, generous with his time and happy to talk despite an image for being reluctant to do interviews. He is understandably excited about City's future and there is a boyish innocence when he talks of playing alongside Robinho, the club's showpiece signing. \"One of my mates heard before me,\" he recalls. \"He rang me to say, 'We've signed Robinho.' I just went, 'Yeah, whatever . . .' I mean, he's the sort of player you would usually only pick for City in a computer game.\"</p> <p>Robinho, he reports, has quickly won over his new team-mates. \"When he turned up for his first day it was really weird for everyone,\" says Richards. \"It needed a week before we could get our heads around it and stop staring. But he's just one of the boys now. Coming from Real Madrid, we were all thinking, 'What's he going to be like? Is he going to be a superstar? Up his own arse?' But he's a really nice lad. He went around the dressing room and shook hands with everyone and he speaks a lot better English than we imagined.\"</p> <p>The beauty of City's new-found wealth is that Robinho is just the first of many \u00a330m-plus signings. The plan, in case anybody in the sporting world is not yet aware, is global domination and, even though Richards warns \"it will not happen overnight\", he is confident the club can win the Premier League within three years. \"We could probably go out and get another 10 superstars in January,\" he points out.</p> <p>These, however, are strange times for Richards and the smile disappears as he contemplates how, almost unnoticed in the Michael Owen debate, his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/england\">England </a>career appears to have stalled. He has not played a single minute since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/fabio-capello\">Fabio Capello's</a> appointment and admits to being \"frustrated\" as he tries to find a reason. \"I'd played 11 games, been constantly hyped in the media and I thought I had a good chance of keeping my place. Then I got an injury and ever since then I don't know why it is, but I can't get back in. I do believe I should be in the squad.\" </p> <p>That last sentence should not be construed as arrogance. Richards simply belongs to that new breed of footballer who is supremely confident, with his snazzy designer gear and tram lines shaved into his eyebrows. He has been called cocky; in reality he is just full of proud self-belief and strong of mind, a useful trait for any sportsman and something that can be traced back to his upbringing in Chapeltown, an unloved district of Leeds synonymous with the Yorkshire Ripper murders, social deprivation and crime.</p> <p>\"It was hard growing up there,\" says Richards. \"There was a lot of drugs and gun-shooting. But my dad [Lincoln] was always by my side and because I always played football I didn't get involved in the drug scene and all the other kinds of stuff. I saw it all and I knew what was happening but I never went down that road.\"</p> <p>Lincoln, a dreadlocked Rastafarian, moved to England from St Kitts in the 60s. \"I wasn't always as disciplined as I should have been and I'm not going to lie - there were times when I was younger and did things that I shouldn't have,\" says Richards. \"My dad knew what the area was like and he would say to me, \"You've got the opportunity to make something good of yourself - don't screw it up by doing something stupid.' I listened to his advice and that's why I'm here today.\"</p> <p>His journey took him via Leeds United, who failed to recognise his potential and let him go. Oldham Athletic picked up the pieces and signed him on schoolboy forms, and it was not long before City got wind of his talent.</p> <p>There is a tragic twist. While Richards dedicated himself to becoming a professional, a parallel can be drawn with another of the talented young players from Chapeltown. Daniel Nelson grew up on a nearby street and shared Richards's expectation to make a career out of football. Then he fell in with the wrong crowd and slipped out of the game. By the time Richards made his debut for City, Nelson had hanged himself in prison while facing drug charges. \"We were good friends and we grew up playing football together,\" says Richards. \"It was just a horrible waste of life - a mate of mine who had been in the same team as me. I can still remember finding out and how upsetting it was. I guess he felt he had no other option but to end his life. It just shows what can happen if you are not focused.\" </p> <p>There were other evils, too. At the age of 12, playing for Leeds City Boys, Richards was bewildered by the loud grunts when the ball came near him. \"After a few seconds I realised they were monkey noises,\" he says. \"It wasn't just the boys but their parents as well. There were mums and dads around the pitch and they were joining in.\"</p> <p>Eight years on Richards is an ambassador for Kick It Out and, though he has no desire to be seen as a crusader or political campaigner, he does admit to being dismayed by the \u00a314,920 fine that Fifa imposed on Croatia for the racist abuse suffered by Emile Heskey during England's game in Zagreb. \"I don't think it is acceptable,\" he says. \"In this day and age that kind of money is pigeon-feed. I'm realistic and I know my opinion is not going to change anything. But if a crowd is making racist chants, I think the authorities should just ban them, end of story.\"</p> <p>Does he agree with the Football Association's insistence that England's friendly against Spain is not played at the Bernab\u00e9u, the stadium where Ashley Cole and Shaun Wright-Phillips were targeted in 2004? \"I wouldn't make that condition because it makes it look like they [the racists] have won. It's a nice gesture from the FA because they obviously don't want our players to hear those chants again. </p> <p>But it defeats the object. We should go over to Madrid, play the match there and, if there is racist behaviour, Spain should be banned.\"</p> <p>The game is on February 11 and by then Richards, now 20, hopes to have convinced Capello to resurrect his England career. Time is on his side - and it is worth remembering that when he broke into the team he was young enough to be still living in digs. \"That was the really weird thing,\" he says. \"I didn't have my own house and shared a place in Stockport with Karl Moore, who's at Millwall now. When I got the call to say I was in the squad I just thought it was one of the other academy lads winding me up. But when I got my first cap I wanted my second and third. And that's what it's like now.\" Richards' time will surely come again.</p> <h2>Kick It Out plans 1,000 events over next 10 days</h2> <p>Young, black and successful, it is easy to understand why Kick It Out considers Micah Richards as the type of footballer it wants to promote its campaign. The organisation's 2008 week of action began on Thursday and there will be awareness events across the country at this weekend's fixtures.</p> <p>\"Micah is one of our most high-profile ambassadors and he's also one of the youngest players involved with us,\" Danny Lynch, the Kick It Out spokesman, said at the launch of the annual One Game, One Community event. \"Player support like this is absolutely vital to the continuing success of our campaign.\"</p> <p>There will be more than 1,000 events over the next 10 days, with all 92 clubs in England's top four divisions holding their own anti-racism programme. As well as racial prejudice and anti-Semitism, the topics will include the problem of homophobia, the lack of British-Asian professionals in the game and the difficulties that disabled fans encounter at stadiums.</p> <p>\"It's an opportunity to highlight our work at every level of the game,\" says Lord Herman Ouseley, chairman of Kick It Out. \"It's a time to celebrate the diversity football offers.\"</p> <p>Paul Ince, who made history this season by becoming the Premier League's first British-born black manager, has joined Richards in supporting the campaign. \"Being a part of the weeks of action is an honour for me,\" said the Blackburn Rovers manager. \"Kick It Out has been pivotal in fighting discrimination in the English game.\"</p> <p>Other ambassadors include Park Ji-sung (Manchester United), Nicolas Anelka (Chelsea), Ledley King (Tottenham Hotspur) and Freddy Eastwood (Coventry City).</p> <p>Richards has represented City for the past two seasons. \"I haven't experienced any form of racism in the Premier League but I know it does happen in some places abroad and it isn't going to go away overnight,\" he says. </p> <p>\"As a black person I know what it is like to be on the receiving end. I've heard monkey noises and it's hurtful and upsetting. Players shouldn't be judged on the colour of their skin. Everyone should be equal and that's the message Kick It Out wants to get across.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Guardian can today reveal that in less than two years this gun was used in at least seven shootings, including one murder, as it was passed between hoods, rented out or stolen by rival street gangs in the UK. Its discovery has added much needed information to senior police officers who admit there is a significant intelligence gap on criminal weaponry.</p> <p>Unlike many firearms used in London, Manchester and Birmingham, cities that account for 60% of serious gun crime by gangs, RS1 is a real weapon, not a converted replica. Its magazine held commercially manufactured ammunition, rather than \"homemade\" bullets - something often seen by detectives - and the ageing weapon was probably purchased for between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000.</p> <p>The trail left by the firearm can be reported following the life sentences handed down yesterday to two street gangsters for murder.</p> <p>It was discovered on a November morning in 2006 when a teenage boy set off for school telling his mother not to look in his room. </p> <p>Whether it was something in his tone, or just a mother's instinct, she ignored him. In his bedroom he kept a toy safe for his belongings, and inside she found the gun. She called the police and the firearm was taken away to a forensics laboratory where it was identified as a CZ .32 Colt Model 1927, manufactured by Ceska Zbrojovka of Strakonice, Czechoslovakia. </p> <p>The gun was loaded, with three live rounds in the magazine. A bullet was lodged in the barrel.</p> <p>A few weeks later Detective Inspector Dave Manning, of the Metropolitan police's Trident unit, received a telephone call. After more than eight months investigating the murder of a notorious drug dealer, killer and kidnapper called Andrew Wanogho, he had all but given up on receiving such a contact.</p> <p>His inquiry was fraught with difficulties. At 26, the victim was running a syndicate of teenage armed robbers who would also do his drug running. Shortly before his murder Wanogho complained to the woman he called his \"baby mother\" - the mother of his child - that he did not have a friend left in the world.</p> <p>His killing was, on the face of it, just another inner city gangland shooting; the sort officers from Trident deal with all the time but which pass almost un-noticed by the media.</p> <p>But this inquiry opened a window on to a criminal subculture which exists cheek by jowl with ordinary families in ordinary neighbourhoods; the class A drug dealing, the incredible reach of the criminal networks, the threatening and taking of lives, the kidnappings, sexual violence, extortion and witness intimidation. </p> <p>And at the heart of it all, the tool used to enforce and protect: the gun.</p> <p>Wanogho, known as Sparks, was a powerful amateur boxer who had fought successfully in the United States. Held in awe and fear in equal measure by his peers, he was seen as a protector by some but a mercurial and extremely violent man by others. </p> <p>A Pentecostal pastor described to the 350 people at his funeral in Brockley, south London, how he would push his disabled brother to church each week in a wheelchair. Less was said of his history of violence. </p> <p>\"He was a formidable boxer and would beat people to a pulp and get pleasure out of it,\" said one source. </p> <p>He once kidnapped and tortured a bus driver whose brother was a rival drug dealer. </p> <p>The man was driven to a flat and chained to a radiator before Wanogho held a hot iron against his face. It was all done to intimidate the man's brother into giving up his drug stash. Four years before his murder Wanogho was charged with the murder of a man shot dead outside an east London nightclub. He escaped conviction after two witnesses withdrew their evidence because they were in fear of their lives.</p> <p>In August 2005, Wanogho survived an assassination attempt as he left a courtroom where he had watched a girlfriend plead guilty to possession of one of his guns in order to save him from jail. Eight months later he was not so lucky.</p> <p>Manning was convinced the hit on Wanogho in April 2006 had been organised by an inmate at HMP Belmarsh on a mobile phone that was smuggled into the prison system and which, investigations revealed, had made 17,000 calls in seven months. </p> <p>But facing a wall of silence, Trident officers spent months scanning thousands of pages of mobile records until a pattern emerged. The inmate, Delphon Nicholas, had made a flurry of calls in the hours before the killing to his best friend, a gunman, rapist and drug trafficker called Trevor Dennie.</p> <p>Both men had fallen out with Wanogho over drugs and women and Dennie was heard telling a friend: \"I've had enough of Andy, he's gone too far. He's barred from the ends.\" </p> <p>At 1.30am on April 8 2006 Wanogho stepped out of a car outside the home of Nicholas's former girlfriend. </p> <p>He told Sean Albert, who had driven him, that he was \"up for a bit of a shagging\".</p> <p>Albert drove a discreet distance away to wait until he was called again. But Dennie was lying in wait and as Albert pulled up a few houses down the road he heard a series of gun shots in rapid succession. </p> <p>He looked in his rear view mirror and saw Wanogho, head down, sprinting towards him. But just as he reached the car he crumpled to the ground, hit in the back by a bullet that pierced his heart. </p> <p>On Wanogho's body police found the incongruous possessions of a Class A drug dealer and gangster - a \u00a317,000 diamond encrusted Cartier watch and \u00a31.11 in cash. They also recovered two of the four bullets fired, including one that had ricocheted off a parked car and landed in a front garden.</p> <p>The closest they got to the gun, however, was a witness who described seeing Dennie brandishing it over his head at an east London nightclub a few hours later and boasting that he had killed Wanogho.</p> <p>Eight months on Manning was told that the gun found in a 14-year-old boy's bedroom was his murder weapon. Somehow it had passed from Dennie through several hands to being stored by the boy on the orders of an older hood, probably as some kind of initiation rite. Ballistics tests showed that the .32 caliber handgun had been used in at least seven shootings in less than two years, six in south London and one in Sussex.</p> <p>On New Year's Eve in 2004 a police officer was responding to a 999 call from a victim of a robbery in Brockley Cross, in the heart of what Dennie described as his \"manor\". He arrived to find three men nearby, and as he walked up to speak to them, the trio ran. But one man turned, pulled a gun and shot at the constable as he fled.</p> <p>This time the bullet missed its target. Police made inquiries but never made any headway. No arrests were made and the firearm disappeared back into the shadows.</p> <p>It emerged 10 months later at the Cube nightclub in Camberwell Green, south London, in a petty dispute. The victim happened to bump into a man as he went to the toilet and was shot in the thigh for his clumsiness.</p> <p>In April 2006 the handgun reached its zenith with the murder of Wanogho, leaving a bullet lodged in his heart and two others at the scene which provided the vital link. Three weeks after the murder the firearm emerged once more at M-Blax nightclub in Peckham. At around 5.40am in the final hour of clubbing, a group of young men from a north London gang burst into the venue carrying weapons, intent on shooting up their south London rivals. </p> <p>Clubbers screamed and ran as a gunfight broke out in the crowded club. At least 21 shots were fired and three men were taken to hospital. Cartridges found at the scene matched the firearm found in the boy's bedroom.</p> <p>By June 2006 the gun had been passed on or stolen once more, its value by now diminished because of its use in a murder. It appeared again at the unlikely venue of Pontins in Camber Sands, when a group of teenagers from the capital travelled to the Sussex holiday camp for an urban music weekend. </p> <p>Large crowds gathered on the Sunday at the main hip hop stage, but in the midst off the rave the sound of gunshots sent young people running for cover. By the time local police arrived with firearms teams the elusive weapon had melted away into the background once more.</p> <p>A month later it was back in south London again, when shots were fired at a car. The gun was probably last used in the autumn of 2006 when it was accidentally fired by a would-be gangster.</p> <p>In the remaining four weeks of its criminal life the firearm was passed into the hands of the teenage boy, who according to sources, was bullied by the hoods because he suffered from Asperger's syndrome.</p> <p>It provided a forensic treasure trove. \"It is quite rare to recover guns at all, so to recover a weapon that is linked to seven shootings is unusual,\" said Manning. \"Everyone talks about guns being available on street corners, but it's not quite as easy as that to get hold of one. It's even more difficult to get hold of real ammunition.\"</p> <p>The boy's experience gave credence to anecdotal evidence that criminals are forcing younger boys to store their guns to test their mettle and once the gun was found the teenager was said to be terrified of repercussions. But his mother's actions in calling the police perhaps saved him from being sucked into a life of crime.</p> <p>Nicholas and Dennie began life sentences for the murder of Wanogho yesterday, closing the final chapter on the story of a gun that ended the life of one veteran gangster before initiating a young boy to follow in his footsteps.</p> <h2>History of gun crime</h2> <p>Intelligence on how many illegal firearms are in use on Britain's streets is limited and sometimes <strong>contradictory</strong>. Senior officers believe that weapons are often rented out and are therefore linked to multiple offences but in recent times there has been an influx of weapons from eastern Europe, particularly the Russian made <strong>9mm</strong> <strong>Baikal</strong>, a self defence pistol used for firing CS gas which is converted to carry real bullets in factories in Lithuania.</p> <p>Sources close to the new <strong>National Ballistics Intelligence Service</strong>, which contains intelligence and ballistic reports on every recovered illegal firearm, say at least 250 Baikals have been recovered in the last two years. But at around <strong>\u00a32,500 on the street</strong>, the Russian pistol is out of reach for some members of urban gangs. Many of the weapons held in the NBIS armory are pre-war semi automatic pistols, which despite their <strong>decrepit</strong> state have still killed and wounded. It is these type of weapons - which can be bought for a few hundred pounds - that are often used by young men in <strong>London</strong>, <strong>Manchester</strong>, and <strong>Liverpool</strong>. In Manchester, where certain areas are not penetrated by police, getting hold of a gun is easier than in London. </p> <p>Home Office data shows gun crime is up since last year, despite the doubling of the sentence, to a five year minimum, for possessing or supplying firearms. </p> <p>The last three years have seen the ages of those carrying and using weapons fall dramatically from around 27 to 16 and 17 year olds. A 13-year-old boy became the <strong>youngest </strong>to be charged with possession of a firearm this year.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday October 21 2008.

  "<h2>1. The short, sharp shock </h2> <p><strong>V-shaped recession</strong></p> <p>Gordon Brown's bank rescue plans work like magic. Interest rates are slashed to 3.5% by Christmas and, after the festive season, confidence returns to the banks and they start to lend again. Rates are cut further, to 2.5% by summer. House prices stabilise as buyers come back and consumer and business confidence turns up. </p> <p>Companies report lower profits, but there are not big collapses. Commodity prices stabilise. Oil goes to $60 and stays there, helping bring inflation down to 2%. </p> <p>A few emerging-market economies have similar wobbles to Iceland but get assistance from the International Monetary Fund. The global economy is helped by only a mild slowdown in China and unemployment in India peaks at 2.5m.</p> <h2>2. Five years of gloom</h2> <p><strong>U-shaped recession</strong></p> <p>Banks remain reluctant to lend as a harsh new regulatory regime bites. Lenders focus on only the safest loans to the best risks. Interest rates fall to 2.5% by the summer but banks do not pass the lower rate on to borrowers in order to rebuild profits and capital bases. Some banks require further capital injections. Policymakers run out of ideas. China's growth slows, inflation remains and unemployment hits 3 million. The FTSE-100 is stuck at 3300-3800. Repossessions rise and properties lose 40% of their value. Numerous company failures, but after five years, the first green shoots of recovery start to appear.</p> <h2>3. The double-dipper</h2> <p><strong>W-shaped recession</strong></p> <p>It looks just like the short sharp shock, but Opec cuts production and there is a new drought in wheat-producing regions. At the same time pay demands take off and inflation re-emerges. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee lifts interest rates. Consumers lose confidence and struggle to repay their debts. A new round of bank write-offs begins. Repossession rates and corporate failures climb again.</p> <h2>4. The lost decade </h2> <p><strong>L-shaped recession</strong></p> <p>As witnessed after the Japanese banking crisis: today's inflation turns to next year's deflation. The banks remain reluctant to lend and consumers struggle to repay their loans. Bad debts mount, house prices fall 40% after a sharp drop and then a sustained drift. </p> <p>Corporate failures are at a record rate and unemployment reaches 3.5m. House repossessions rise as borrowers lose their jobs. There are bank failures and a couple of insurance companies topple over. The US is also in deep recession and the Chinese economy faces a hard landing. The FTSE-100 index dips to 3000 - another 25% down on today's levels and more than 50% below its 2007 peak - and fails to recover.</p> <h2>5. Armageddon</h2> <p>A new war in the Middle East pushes oil prices into the stratosphere. Central banks have to raise interest rates to combat inflation. Most major economies tip into depression.</p> <p>Banking systems in many countries collapse, leading to widespread chaos as people are unable to access their money or pay for anything. Riots ensue and long queues appear outside soup kitchens as governments put soldiers on the streets to maintain order. Unemployment exceeds the peak seen in the 1930s. Overall world output falls for more than a decade. It's the worst depression the world has ever seen.<br><strong>Julia Finch and Ashley Seager</strong></p>",
  "<p>Normally, it would have been a dire week. Inflation rose to a 16-year high of 5.2%, the jobless total hit its highest level in 17 years and there was gloomy news from the high street and the housing market. The US was in equally bad shape. Consumer confidence, according to figures out yesterday, suffered its sharpest ever one-month fall last month as the public digested the implications of a month of mayhem on Wall Street.</p> <p>But these are not normal times and in London, Washington, Paris and Berlin last night there was a sense that the week could have been much worse; in fact, that the world was back from the abyss.</p> <p>When Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the IMF, warned last Saturday that the world's financial system was \"on the brink of systemic meltdown\" he was voicing the views of every central bank governor and finance minister attending the gloomiest and most crucial meeting of the fund for a generation. </p> <p>The talk in the corridors of the IMF was of what could be done before markets opened on Monday morning to prevent the collapse of the western banking system and a descent into a 1930s-style slump. The emergency package hammered out first in Washington and then in Paris averted the catastrophe. Markets remain nervous, share prices have moved up and down, the mood in the City and on Wall Street has remained downbeat as traders have woken up to the notion that the global economy is heading for recession - and probably a big one at that.</p> <p>But Lord Turner, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, spoke for many this week when he said last weekend would prove \"a watershed\". Contingency plans were put in place last week for the apocalyptic scenario. The reason Alistair Darling, the chancellor, and Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, will sleep easier this weekend is that catastrophe has been averted. For now the sense of relief goes no deeper than that.</p> <p>Last Friday was a day of blind panic on the London stock exchange. Bank shares were hammered, with Royal Bank of Scotland losing a quarter of its stock market value. The Edinburgh-based bank was worth almost \u00a360bn a year ago, but as the City closed for business it was valued at just \u00a311.5bn.</p> <p>It was clear to the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FSA that the banking crisis had not been solved by Darling's announcement two days earlier of a grand bail-out. By last Friday, febrile markets were searching for details on which banks would need capital and how much.</p> <p>The Treasury and the FSA summoned the banks to find a solution before the markets opened on Monday. It was not just bankers who spent a weekend locked away. Lawyers, accountants and top City investors were all engaged in a frantic attempt to end the uncertainty and put an amount on the capital cushions that the banks would need appease regulators worried about the strength of the system.</p> <p>The mood was bleak. So were some of the contingency plans being considered by the authorities to ensure some of calm could return on Monday. Darling had been at the IMF on Friday but left the meetings early to deal with the crisis at home. A number of contingencies were discussed, with consideration given to suspending stock markets.</p> <p>In London \u00a3250bn had been wiped off the value of the top 100 shares in the previous week. The fear was that the market would go into a fatal spiral if fears about the strength of the major banks could not be abated before Monday morning.</p> <p>Even if stockmarkets did not need to be closed discussions were held about halting trading in bank shares which had been dragging the wider markets lower. Consideration was also given to calling an emergency bank holiday, such was the anxiety about how bank customers would respond to further falls in share prices of the banks holding their savings.</p> <p>While cash machines would have probably kept dispensing money, banks would have closed their doors for the day to give themselves a breathing space.</p> <p>In the event, such drastic steps were deemed unnecessary. The deal hammered out with RBS, HBOS, Lloyds and Barclays on Sunday night - at audiences with City minister Paul Myners that were described by one banker as \"not so much a meeting as a drive-by shooting\" - provided officials with enough confidence to believe that markets would be reassured.</p> <p>Stock markets soared on Monday and strains in the world's money markets also started to ease. It proved a temporary reprieve; by the middle of the week shares were on the slide and again and by Thursday night the FTSE 100 was lower than it had been the previous Friday.</p> <p>That was not the end of a rollercoaster week: a late rally on Wall Street allowed the FTSE to claw back above 4,000 points and close modestly up on the week. Amid fears that next year could see the economy contract for the first time since 1991 and unemployment surge above 2 million, there was concern about insurance companies, hedge funds and pension funds. But the banks are thought safe - for now.</p>",

  "<p>It's only been a couple of weeks since the Doncaster Trades Union &amp; Labour Club moved into its new premises, and it still feels as if the members are settling in. Part of the issue might be that the surroundings are so unexpected: no battered, dark snug, but a shiny, brightly-lit bar in the also shiny, brightly-lit Frenchgate shopping centre. </p> <p>Grizzled men in work clothes and fluorescent bibs perch experimentally on pristine banquettes and watch the ladies' darts team take on Balby Bridge. The only overt sense of 111-years of history comes from the photographs of old Doncaster on the walls, and the lock boxes under the snooker tables containing the regular players' cues. The woman behind the bar likes this better than their old haunt. \"Bit classier.\" </p> <p>Doncaster generally feels like a town still uneasily trying to meld old and new. It came of age as an industrial centre. Seventeen pits produced coal for the steel factories of Rotherham, Scunthorpe and Sheffield; the Flying Scotsman was built here (London Underground trains are still manufactured here, by a company called Wabtec). And then came Margaret Thatcher, and the closure of the pits. </p> <p>\"Twenty to 25 years ago, there was almost like a social mourning going on,\" says Steven Shaw, the chief executive of Doncaster Chamber. \"You'd lost a huge chunk of the rail industry, virtually all the mining and virtually all the steel.\" It became a byword for unemployment and economic depression, and took nearly 15 years, says Shaw, before a strategy for the future emerged. </p> <p>You can see that process physically, in the townscape: narrow brick streets and alleyways at the centre, bumping into the Frenchgate; or on the outskirts of Doncaster Central, the 16,000-seat new Keepmoat stadium, the new racecourse, the new bloodstock sales centre, the brand new Robin Hood international airport, and the counter-intuitively wood-clad new fire station.</p> <p>\"Doncaster's like a boomtown,\" says the town's first elected mayor, Martin Winter. He has dispensed with his driver and is showing the Guardian around himself, a big ex-rugby league player hunched over the wheel of a car that seems too small.</p> <p>Between 2000 and 2007 \u00a31.4bn was invested in Doncaster, creating more than 22,000 jobs. (Long-term worklessness is still high, however. About 20,000 people claim incapacity benefit, often due to physical injuries from mining, although about 7,000 are stress related). </p> <p>Most of this money is private, but the council contributed about \u00a35m to the Frenchgate and \u00a330m of taxpayers' money went into the Lakeside sports complex; the New Deal for Communities has, over 10 years, put \u00a352m into crime reduction, education, job training, health and housing in deprived areas, which includes Doncaster Central, whose MP, Rosie Winterton is minister of state for pensions reform at the Department for Work and Pensions. (This area seems to provide a disproportionate number of cabinet members: there is also Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, in Doncaster North, and Caroline Flint, minister of state for Europe and the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office, who is MP for the Don Valley.) </p> <p>Regardless of who was paying, there was a deliberate attempt to have Doncaster people trained and working on the big projects; there were strictures that materials be locally sourced. The airport alone is predicted to create employment for 1,500 people by 2016.</p> <p>But things seem to be changing. Last week government figures showed that Doncaster Central had the fastest increase in benefit claimants of any English constituency in the 12 months to September. There are now 2,343 claimants, a rise of 537 since last year. The mayor and his staff say they don't recognise this picture, but elsewhere the story is a little different. Even the employed start straight in with \"It's too many foreigners willing to work for minimum wage\", and concern is rising, the harbinger, perhaps, of how the expected recession might look.</p> <p>At the Trades Club, Peter Buckenham, 52, still in work clothes after a day driving timber lorries through Derbyshire, is nursing a pint. For the first time he only got two days of work this week. The company he works for is feeling the pinch, and laying people off. \"I'm worried.\" Other people he knows are too. </p> <p>No-one's been made redundant quite yet, but a friend has shut his computer shop. When he joined the club they asked, \"Are you working?\" and told him he was one of the few.</p> <p>Unless you count the 600 workers laid off last week at Sheffield car parts supplier LSUK (which has a knock-on effect in Doncaster as many people commute), or McCormick tractor factory, which closed in 2006, with the loss of 325 jobs, there haven't yet been huge redundancies. Rather it's a case of a little here and a little there, \"a creep of lots of things,\" as Graeme Huston, editor of the Doncaster Free Press, puts it. At the local Jobcentre Plus, Jonathan Kay, 23, who's just moved back after finishing a degree in Leicester, is finding it slow. \"There doesn't seem to be a lot going on, unless you want to work in a call centre.\" Most of the job losses so far seem to be a direct result of the bank crisis - and thus in new building and home sales. \"Probably the first tranche of heavy losses were in the legal sector,\" says Shaw. \"A lot of the conveyancing lawyers were the first people to notice.\" One high street practice had to lay off 60 of its 360 staff in April. </p> <p>Colin Wright, managing director of Wright Investments, which specialises in property, transport and storage, has just had to liquidate his building division, and lay off 20 people. \"What's happening with the housing market started affecting us last Christmas,\" he says. \"I carried on funding projects myself, thinking it'll come back - and then all this happened a few weeks ago.\" He says the bigger national builders were closing down their sites six months ago. \"The thing with the construction industry is that most of the guys are quite highly paid. When they go out of work it has quite an affect in the economy. They're big spenders and don't tend to save.\" </p> <p>The Chamber is a membership organisation, and they have noticed a spike in companies failing to renew because they've gone bust - 10 in August alone, mainly in retail and the service sector. The pubs are quieter and the volunteering organisation CVS has seen a sharp rise in inquiries, mostly unemployed people looking for work experience as opposed to people looking to help, says manager Julie Cox. Last year the largest group was under 25s; this year they are between 29 and 34 years old. </p> <p>What's interesting is that the effect hasn't been felt across the board. \"This economic downturn has been like nothing I've experienced,\" says Shaw. \"It's been much much quicker, and less indiscriminate than in the early 1990s. Then everybody suffered. It was universal. </p> <p>\"In this current cycle we're still seeing areas that are doing exceptionally well - the Primarks, the Nettos. In the early 90s the engineering sector was absolutely decimated. But we're still seeing engineers and manufacturers of hi-tech products - aviation, hi-tech metals, fibre optics - doing exceptionally well.\" </p> <p>They have been so battered over the last 25 years \"that if you're still in business you're probably a lean mean business anyway\". But the large-scale job-creating investments, New Deal or otherwise, seem to be holding up OK too. \"The jobs that they've created are real jobs and they're still there.\"</p> <p>Shaw is keen to stress Doncaster's potential: its transport links, development space and the national firms that have been moving in. \"It's a much nicer place to be than 20 years ago.\" But they have to be realistic too. A lot of the really big projects are now finished, says Wright, and \"the new big projects won't start for a long time. I think it'll get a lot worse before it gets better\".</p>",
  "<p>Have you heard? Evolution has stopped. Geneticist Steve Jones says so, confounding those whose every trip on public transport confirms the belief that it is in a period of active and accelerating reversal.</p> <p>Apparently, thanks to the blunting by modern technology of the keen edge of the Darwinian influences that once carved the fit from the unfit, genetic mutation is no longer giving rise to improved versions of humanity. My childhood dreams of one day walking among people with spaghetti arms like Mr Tickle or Tefal foreheads like, well, the men in the Tefal ads, lie crushed and broken amidst so many others.</p> <p>So this dull, fleshy, sausage-like casing with various occasional protuberances according to age and sex is as good as it gets? All I can say is I'm glad I wasn't one of the links in the chain that got us to this profoundly unsatisfactory endpoint. All that hard work - tilt those pelves! Stop that slouching! Work that limbic system! - to create a species that could give the world cheese in a can. Cro-Magnon, thou shouldst have impaled thyself on thy antler-tipped spear when thou hadst the chance. </p> <p>You could, of course, argue that now that we're freed from the burden of physical alteration, we can devote ourselves, like the nobles of old, to cultivating a love of the arts of love, scholarship and the honing of a fine moral sense. I admire your optimism. I have a penchant for the foundationless belief myself. But I would refer you to the cheese - in a can - and advise you to trade in that argument for a dose of commonsense and maybe an array of soft drugs to get you through the rest of what is bound to be an existence steeped in disappointment and despair.</p> <p>On the other hand, the news does, pleasingly, leave intelligent design theorists in a bit of a hole. If God did indeed set out to use evolution to create, eventually, man in his own image, we must all now recognise that God is a fat bloke with his feet up watching Sky+. As iconographical bases go, this one is not a winner. Hard to come back from that.</p> <p>Cats and dogs, however, must be ecstatic. I bet it's all over the Starlight Barking (and whatever the feline equivalent is) network. \"Guys, guys, they've stopped! Yeah, seriously! This is all they are! All they're ever going to be! C'mon, we've got to try harder. We've already got four legs and teeth - if we can get our tails to swipe Oyster cards, we're golden!\"</p> <p>But, for humans, it means the party is largely over. No wings. No spaghetti arms. No spectacular, counterbalancing improvement in the life of the mind. Just ever more recalcitrant generations of children who, when urged to behave better, aim higher, stop burning buildings, will simply raise their faces to the prating adult and ask, unanswerably, \"Why, bumcrack? Where are we going from here?\"</p> <p>The only course of action must be to kickstart the evolutionary process again. Fortunately, there are a number of current trends that can be pressed into this service. The rising popularity of the Tories for one. They will abolish the NHS, thereby exposing the congenitally weak, who have had it too easy for too long, to the full winnowing effect of disease and injury. The various programmes to reintroduce wolves and other beasts will do the same job in Scotland, picking off the halt and the lame as they stagger croftwards over treacherously tussocky grass. Global warming will take care of the rest, scything through the population until only a race of fleet-footed, melanin-stuffed superhumans who can hydrate themselves for a week with a single drop of acid rain are left. Until then, keep an eye on your pets.</p>",
  "<p>If my life was confined to a patch of land 200 metres square, beyond which the environment was either so dangerous or so incomprehensible that I never strayed, it would matter less to me whether or not I ended up in jail. It may be possible in this country to feel freer while imprisoned than not. This is a thought I had when looking at drawings, published this week by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, by young people showing the pitifully small areas in which they feel safe.</p> <p>Two 11-year-olds in Glasgow drew almost identical maps of their locality, but the streets they regarded as safe or unsafe to traverse were mirror images of each other. An 18-year-old in Peterborough drew the sole route he can take to the shops without fearing violence, adding the precise locations of the CCTV cameras that line it. There were no walls to contain them but those created by their own perceptions. </p> <p>Fear overshadows the lives of people growing up in poor and, in many respects, resource-starved areas. There is the literal fear of being attacked, but there's also the fear of the unknown. I have never doubted that your living environment shapes your experience - and, if you're not careful, can come to define and limit it. When the area you consider to be free from threat narrows to a couple of hundred metres, being told that there's a whole world out there sounds like an insult. You know there is; it's just not for you. If it was, there really would be nothing to be scared of. </p> <p>There are remarkably few areas of your life of which you can wrest control, which only increases the scope for anxiety. If you or your parents are housed by the local authority, have no job and few qualifications on leaving school - and therefore little money - the desire for autonomy in at least some aspect of your life has to find some expression. The universal capacity for complex thinking is more likely to be channelled, in the absence of other opportunities, into mapping, classifying and guarding single pages of the A to Z.</p> <p>But, as one of the young people interviewed about their experiences infers, the respect you get from controlling - or appearing to control - an area is as empty as it is instant. It only matters to people whose lives are very similar to yours. It has no standing in the wider world, and they themselves know it; yet still they need something to offer up as their own. </p> <p>For many young people the world truly is their oyster, and this is reflected in the fact that they tend not to expend valuable energy on \"repping their endz\". There are no \"endz\" in sight for those brought up to assume that no experience is closed to them on the basis of who they are. But for many others the outside world is another planet, for all they are equipped to grasp its opportunities. So they act as though it doesn't, and do their best to pretend it doesn't matter. </p> <p>If it was really so great being poor, urban and working class, pride would exist in place of territoriality. The latter is mean, negative, defensive, isolating: instinctively ungenerous. To have pride in your locality suggests there's enough interest and variety in your daily life to consider it worth celebrating. </p> <p>That's not what you see on YouTube, where the kids who cycle in ever-decreasing circles around my old East End neighbourhood paint a brutal, hyperbolic, but nonetheless truthful, picture of the estate they regard as the seat of their identity. There's simply not enough good stuff to go around.</p> <p>You don't need to be incarcerated to live an unfree life. Ignorance, fear and perceived lack of freedom form an endless trapping pattern. \"Not leaving or going anywhere, that's just normal, that's just life. It's the right thing to do,\" a young resident of a north London estate told the Guardian this week in response to the JRF's findings. </p> <p>Who needs bricks when you can build walls in your head?<br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"><br>comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Biotechnology applied to crafting nutritional improvements in rice is on the verge of offering the kinds of public health benefits to Asia we haven't seen since the 20th-century's green revolution improved the nutrition and longevity of billions of people. </p> <p>Last month, the Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry bestowed the prestigious Bertebos prize on Swiss plant biologist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingo_Potrykus\">Ingo Potrykus</a>. He is the co-inventor of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/mar/21/food.gm\">\"golden rice\"</a>, a collection of new rice varieties biofortified, or enriched, by the introduction of genes that express beta-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A. (It is converted in the body, as needed, to the active form.)</p> <p>Why was this achievement important? After all, most physicians in North America and Europe never see a single case of vitamin A deficiency in their professional lifetimes. The situation is very different in poor developing countries, however. Vitamin A deficiency is epidemic among the poor, whose diet is heavily dominated by rice (which contains neither beta-carotene nor vitamin A) or other carbohydrate-rich, vitamin-poor sources of calories.</p> <p>In developing countries, 200-300 million children of preschool age are at risk of vitamin A deficiency, which can be devastating and even fatal. It increases susceptibility to common childhood infections such as measles and diarrhoeal diseases and is the single most important cause of childhood blindness in developing countries. Every year, about 500,000 children become blind as a result of vitamin A deficiency, and 70% die within a year of losing their sight. </p> <p>Why not simply supplement children's diets with vitamin A in capsules or add it to some staple foodstuff, the way that we add iodine to table salt to prevent hypothyroidism and goiter? A good idea in theory, except that neither the resources \u2013 hundreds of millions of dollars annually \u2013 nor the infrastructure for distribution are available.</p> <p>Enter a better, cheaper, more feasible solution: golden rice, which actually <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E3D81F3BF932A15752C1A9669C8B63\">incorporates beta-carotene into the genetically altered rice grains</a>. The concept is simple: Although rice plants do not normally synthesise beta-carotene in the endosperm (seeds) because of the absence of two necessary enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway, they do make it in the green portions of the plant. By using recombinant DNA, or gene-splicing, techniques to introduce the two genes that express these enzymes, the pathway is restored and the rice grains accumulate therapeutic amounts of beta-carotene. </p> <p>Golden rice offers the potential to make contributions to human health and welfare as monumental as the discovery and distribution of the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dm52sa.html\">Salk polio vaccine</a>. With wide use, it could save hundreds of thousands of lives a year and enhance the quality of life for millions more.</p> <p>But one aspect of this shining story is tarnished. Intransigent opposition by anti-science, anti-technology activists - primarily Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and a few other groups \u2013 has spurred already risk-averse regulators to adopt an overly precautionary approach that has stalled approvals. </p> <p>There is nothing about golden rice that should require endless case-by-case reviews and delays. As the British scientific journal <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v17/n11/full/nbt1199_1042.html\">Nature editorialised</a> in 1992, a broad scientific consensus holds that \"the same physical and biological laws govern the response of organisms modified by modern molecular and cellular methods and those produced by classical methods. ... [Therefore] no conceptual distinction exists between genetic modification of plants and microorganisms by classical methods or by molecular techniques that modify DNA and transfer genes.\"</p> <p>Putting it another way, government regulation of field research with plants should focus on the traits that may be related to risk - invasiveness, weediness, toxicity, and so forth - rather than on whether one or another technique of genetic manipulation was used. </p> <p>In spite of its vast potential to benefit humanity \u2013 and negligible likelihood of harm to human health or the environment \u2013 nine years after its creation, golden rice remains hung up in regulatory red tape with no end in sight. By contrast, plants constructed with less precise techniques such as hybridisation or mutagenesis are subject to no government scrutiny or requirements (or opposition from activists) at all. And that applies even to the numerous new plant varieties that have resulted from \"wide crosses\", hybridisations that move genes from one species or genus to another \u2013 across what used to be thought of as natural breeding boundaries. </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/320/5875/425\">an April editorial in the journal Science</a>, Nina Fedoroff, an eminent plant geneticist at Penn State who is currently serving as senior scientific adviser to Condoleezza Rice, wrote: \"A new Green Revolution demands a global commitment to creating a modern agricultural infrastructure everywhere, adequate investment in training and modern laboratory facilities and progress toward simplified regulatory approaches that are responsive to accumulating evidence of safety. Do we have the will and the wisdom to make it happen?\"</p> <p>The golden rice story suggests that the answer is, not yet.</p>",
  "<p>The UN's chief climate change negotiator has predicted that a Barack Obama victory next month would jump-start progress toward global limits on carbon emissions.</p> <p>Dr Rajendra Pachauri, head of the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), said yesterday that other nations would solidify their position on emissions caps after watching how the new American president approaches the issue.</p> <p>\"If Obama is elected, and this seems more likely, this would create positive momentum\" for the December climate talks in Poland and next year's round in Copenhagen, Pachauri told Bloomberg News.</p> <p>The IPCC's mandate states that its reports on climate science should remain \"policy neutral\", giving a ring of the unexpected to Pachauri's remarks on the US political scene. He made no similar remarks about the climate-change policy of Republican nominee John McCain.</p> <p>The Poland talks are likely to determine whether nations can agree on a climate pact to replace the Kyoto protocol by next year's deadline. Environmental activists and Yvo de Boer, chief of the UN climate secretariat, have urged the newly elected US president \u2013 whether Obama or McCain \u2013 to commit to attending the Poland meeting.</p> <p>Neither candidate has publicly stated whether Poland is on his agenda, but Obama has vowed that if Congress does not act on climate change within 18 months after the election, he would use his presidential regulatory powers to set emissions limits.</p> <p>The announcement on climate regulation, from Obama energy adviser Jason Grumet, came in a separate interview with Bloomberg News. Grumet said the short timeframe for a new global climate accord \u2013 the Copenhagen talks end in December 2009 \u2013 would influence Obama's decision-making.</p> <p>\"We cannot have a meaningful impact in the international discussion until we develop a meaningful domestic consensus,\" Grumet said. \"So he'll move quickly.''</p> <p>Under George Bush, the US environmental protection agency (EPA) has refused to use its power under the Clean Air Act to curb emissions. Several state governments and environmental groups successfully challenged that stance before the US supreme court, but the Bush administration has postponed action until the next president arrives.</p> <p>An Obama administration's decision to use the EPA as a regulator of carbon emissions would represent a stark turnabout from the Bush years. Advisers to McCain have suggested that he would prefer Congress to drive American action on climate change to an approach steered by the EPA.</p>",
  "<p>Financial workers at Wall Street's top <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">banks</a> are to receive pay deals worth more than $70bn (\u00a340bn), a substantial proportion of which is expected to be paid in discretionary bonuses, for their work so far this year - despite plunging the global financial system into its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">worst crisis</a> since the 1929 stock market crash, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Staff at six banks including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a> and Citigroup are in line to pick up the payouts despite being the beneficiaries of a $700bn bail-out from the US government that has already prompted criticism. The government's cash has been poured in on the condition that excessive executive pay would be curbed.</p> <p>Pay plans for bankers have been disclosed in recent corporate statements. Pressure on the US firms to review preparations for annual bonuses increased yesterday when Germany's Deutsche Bank said many of its leading traders would join Josef Ackermann, its chief executive, in waiving millions of euros in annual payouts.</p> <p>The sums that continue to be spent by Wall Street firms on payroll, payoffs and, most controversially, bonuses appear to bear no relation to the losses incurred by investors in the banks. Shares in Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have declined by more than 45% since the start of the year. Merrill Lynch and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/morganstanley\">Morgan Stanley</a> have fallen by more than 60%. JP MorganChase fell 6.4% and Lehman Brothers has collapsed.</p> <p>At one point last week the Morgan Stanley $10.7bn pay pot for the year to date was greater than the entire stock market value of the business. In effect, staff, on receiving their remuneration, could club together and buy the bank.</p> <p>In the first nine months of the year Citigroup, which employs thousands of staff in the UK, accrued $25.9bn for salaries and bonuses, an increase on the previous year of 4%. Earlier this week the bank accepted a $25bn investment by the US government as part of its bail-out plan.</p> <p>At Goldman Sachs the figure was $11.4bn, Morgan Stanley $10.73bn, JP Morgan $6.53bn and Merrill Lynch $11.7bn. At Merrill, which was on the point of going bust last month before being taken over by Bank of America, the total accrued in the last quarter grew 76% to $3.49bn. At Morgan Stanley, the amount put aside for staff compensation also grew in the last quarter to the end of August by 3% to $3.7bn.</p> <p>Days before it collapsed into bankruptcy protection a month ago Lehman Brothers revealed $6.12bn of staff pay plans in its corporate filings. These payouts, the bank insisted, were justified despite net revenue collapsing from $14.9bn to a net outgoing of $64m.</p> <p>None of the banks the Guardian contacted wished to comment on the record about their pay plans. But behind the scenes, one source said: \"For a normal person the salaries are very high and the bonuses seem even higher. But in this world you get a top bonus for top performance, a medium bonus for mediocre performance and a much smaller bonus if you don't do so well.\"</p> <p>Many critics of investment banks have questioned why firms continue to siphon off billions of dollars of bank earnings into bonus pools rather than using the funds to shore up the capital position of the crisis-stricken institutions. One source said: \"That's a fair question - and it may well be that by the end of the year the banks start review the situation.\"</p> <p>Much of the anger about investment banking bonuses has focused on boardroom executives such as former Lehman boss Dick Fuld, who was paid $485m in salary, bonuses and options between 2000 and 2007.</p> <p>Last year Merrill Lynch's chairman Stan O'Neal retired after announcing losses of $8bn, taking a final pay deal worth $161m. Citigroup boss Chuck Prince left last year with a $38m in bonuses, shares and options after multibillion-dollar write-downs. In Britain, Bob Diamond, Barclays president, is one of the few investment bankers whose pay is public. Last year he received a salary of \u00a3250,000, but his total pay, including bonuses, reached \u00a336m.</p>",
  "<p>The British government's commitment to raise the UK greenhouse gas emission reduction target in the <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/climatechangehl.html\">Climate Change Bill</a> from 60% to 80% by 2050 is rightly ambitious. But is this yet another unrealistic green target?</p> <p>The answer is yes. Many businesses, investors, green groups and policy wonks have very little confidence in the government's ability to put policies in place to meet our 2020 EU emission target, let alone an 80% reduction by 2050. </p> <p>Part of the reason for this is that so many green targets have been <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/libimages/383.pdf\">twisted, contorted or dropped</a> during the last 11 years. For example, there have been eight significant realignments within energy policy since 2000. The policy uncertainty created by this government dithering has resulted in too few businesses making investments in the infrastructure needed for transition to a low carbon economy. One of the most striking results of this sorry state, is the fact that this government has actually presided over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/dec/10/carbonemissions.climatechange\">rising UK emissions</a>.</p> <p>There are <a href=\"http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/publications/working_papers/wp84.pdf\">other problems</a> as well. The worst kind of creative accounting has been employed for calculating this emissions target. Aviation has been excluded from the 80% target, when this is the sector expected to see by far the largest increase in emissions. It also produces emissions at high altitude which have a significantly larger impact on climate change than emissions released at sea-level. </p> <p>In a recent research paper from Policy Exchange entitled, <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/libimages/383.pdf\">Green dreams: a decade of missed targets</a>, we showed the extent to which the government's green targets were failing. Of 138 high-level targets set by government, 60% have been missed or were unlikely to be met. In areas such as biodiversity conservation, 88% of such targets had been missed. With a track record this poor, we should approach this week's announcement with profound skepticism. </p> <p>Without a credible policy framework to drive the right investment decisions and green choices, significantly reducing UK emissions beyond that delivered by technological change, will be impossible. One of the first things any new government will have to do, is set this framework and do it both credibly and quickly.</p>",
  "<p>There is a 20- or 30-year-old argument between the Democratic left and the Democratic middle on the question of deficit reduction v. economic stimulus. If Obama wins, this argument will return with force (already has, really). Obama has spoken in support of both at different times, but he's lately put a lot of emphasis on a big energy/environment/green-jobs/public-infrastructure program he seems committed to. There'll be enormous pressure on him from some \"fiscally responsible quarters\" to drop this. The esteemed economist Jamie Galbraith <a href=\"http://economy.nationaljournal.com/2008/10/is-there-room-for-fiscal-stimu.php#comments\">argues for stimulus</a> in the National Journal:</p> <blockquote> <p>What is the 20 year Treasury bond rate? Last month, it was 4.32 percent. That is almost<br>exactly what it was in December 1959, in the last month of the Eisnehower administration. The United States Government wasn't going bankrupt then and it isn't going bankrupt now.</p> <p>The point is directly relevant to the question posed by National Journal: \"is there room for fiscal stimulus?\" Of course there is.</p> <p>Not only that, sustained fiscal expansion (I dislike the term \"stimulus\" because I do not think that a short-term policy will work) will be essential in the next administration if the financial rescue just undertaken is to succeed. It will be necessary to stabilize the housing sector. It will be necessary to stabilize state and local government spending, undercut by falling property tax revenues. It will be necessary to stabilize the incomes and expenditures, in the aggregate, of the elderly. It will be necessary to finance new capital spending at the federal, state and local levels.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well said.<br></p>",
  "<p>Normally, it would have been a dire week. In the UK, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">inflation</a> rose to a 16-year high of 5.2%, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/unemploymentdata\">jobless total</a> hit its highest level in 17 years, and there was gloomy news from the high street and the housing market. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">United States </a>was in equally bad shape. Consumer confidence, according to figures out today, has suffered its sharpest one-month fall to date as the public digested the implications of four weeks of mayhem on Wall Street.</p> <p>But these are not normal times. In London, Washington, Paris and Berlin, there is a sense that the week could have been a lot worse; in fact, that the world was back from the abyss. </p> <p>When Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned last Saturday that the world's financial system was \"on the brink of systemic meltdown\", he was voicing the views of every central bank governor and finance minister attending the gloomiest and most crucial meeting of the Fund for a generation. </p> <p>The talk in the corridors of the IMF's 19th Street offices in Washington was of what could be done before markets opened on Monday morning to prevent the collapse of the entire western banking system and a descent into a 1930s-style slump. </p> <p>The emergency package hammered out \u2013 first in Washington and then in Paris \u2013 averted the catastrophe. Markets remain nervous, share prices have ballooned up and down, and the mood in the City and on Wall Street has remained downbeat as traders have woken up to the notion that the global economy is heading for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">recession</a> \u2013 and probably a big one at that. </p> <p>But Adair Turner, the new chairman of the Financial Services Authority (FSA), spoke for many this week when he said the events of last weekend would prove to be \"a watershed\". </p> <p>Contingency plans were put in place last week for the worst-case scenario. The reason that the chancellor, Alistair Darling, and the Bank of England governor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Mervyn King</a>, will sleep easier this weekend is that apocalypse has been averted. </p> <p>For the present, the sense of relief goes no deeper than that.<br>Friday October 10 was a day of blind panic on the London stock market. Bank shares were hammered, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup\">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> losing a quarter of its stock market value. The once-proud Edinburgh-based bank was worth almost \u00a360bn a year ago, but as the City closed for business today, it was valued at just \u00a311.5bn. </p> <p>It was clear to the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FSA that the crisis in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">banking industry</a> had not been solved by Darling's announcement two days earlier of a grand bail-out plan to inject much-needed capital. By last Friday, febrile markets were searching for details about which banks would need to raise capital and by how much.</p> <p>Officials from the Treasury and FSA issued a summons to the banks to find a solution before the markets opened on Monday. </p> <p>It was not just bankers that spent a weekend locked away. Lawyers, accountants and top City investors were all engaged in a frantic attempt to end the uncertainty and put a size on the capital cushions the banks would need to appease regulators worried about the financial strength of the banking system.</p> <p>The mood was bleak. So were some of the contingency plans being considered by the authorities to ensure some semblance of calm could return on Monday. </p> <p>Darling had been at the IMF meeting in Washington on Friday but left early to deal with the crisis at home. A number of contingency arrangements were discussed, with consideration given to suspending stock markets. </p> <p>In London, \u00a3250bn had been wiped off the value of the top 100 shares in the previous week. The fear was that the market would go into a death spiral if fears about the strength of the major banks could not be abated before Monday morning. </p> <p>Even if stockmarkets did not need to be closed in their totality, discussions were held about halting trading in bank shares which had been dragging the wider markets lower. </p> <p>Consideration was also given to calling an emergency bank holiday such was the level of anxiety about how bank customers would respond to further falls in share prices of the banks holding their savings. </p> <p>While cash machines would have probably kept dispensing money, banks would have closed their doors for the day to give themselves breathing space.</p> <p>In the event, such drastic steps were deemed to be unnecessary. The deals hammered out with RBS, HBOS, Lloyds and Barclays on Sunday night with the new City minister, Paul Myners \u2013 described by one banker as \"not so much a meeting as a drive-by shooting\" \u2013 provided officials with enough confidence to believe markets would be reassured.</p> <p>Stockmarkets soared on Monday and strains in the world's money markets also started to ease. </p> <p>It proved a temporary reprieve; by the middle of the week, shares were on the slide and again and, by Thursday night, the FTSE 100 was lower than it had been the previous Friday. </p> <p>That was not the end of a rollercoaster week: a late rally on Wall Street allowed the FTSE to claw back above 4000 points and close modestly up on the week. Amid fears that next year could see the economy contract for the first time since 1991 and unemployment surge well above 2 million, there was concern about insurance companies, hedge funds and pension funds. But the banks are thought to be safe \u2013 for now at least.</p>",
  "<p>Insurance companies managed to miss out as the UK market staged a strong recovery at the end of what has proved another volatile week.</p> <p>After yesterday's 218 point decline to a five and a half year low, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> climbed 201.6 points to 4063.0 despite an uncertain start on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down around 40 points by the time London closed, having traded in a 330-point range after yet more poor economic figures - housing starts and consumer confidence - and a number of <a href=\"http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/10/look-for-a-expi.html\">options expiries</a>.</p> <p>At the start of the week the leading index stood at 3932.1 ahead of the \u00a337bn UK bank bail out - a plan designed to avert financial disaster and one subsequently followed by both US and European authorities.

Overnight sterling libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other - fell by almost 50 basis points, but the three month rates dipped only slightly.</p> <p>Worries that insurers might have to follow the banks and raise more cash to boost their capital levels sent many of their shares lower. <strong>Aviva</strong>, where Goldman Sachs yesterday said the dividend could be vulnerable, lost 44.75p to 308.25p, while <strong>Prudential</strong> fell 27.75p to 270p despite reportedly denying suggestions it might need a rights issue.</p> <p>Jonathan Jackson, an analyst at Killik Capital said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[Until next Tuesday's trading statement by Prudential] the shares are likely to remain very volatile. If the group maintains its dividend this year, the shares are currently yielding 5.7%. At the time of the interim results, the payout was increased by 5% and the group re-iterated its commitment to a progressive dividend policy, with the level of dividend determined after taking into account the group's financial requirements, including opportunities to invest in areas of the business offering attractive returns (with the Asian assets of AIG a possibility).

After plunging as low as 185p on capital worries, the shares recovered to close 15p higher at 225p.</p> <p>Among the other gainers, a number of miners recovered ground after this week's dramatic falls. <strong>Anglo American</strong> added 142p to \u00a312.95, <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> was 84.5p better at 895.5p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rose 200p to \u00a322.50.</p> <p>News that Opec had brought forward an emergency meeting to next week prompted speculation of a cut in production of perhaps a million barrels a day, and pushed the crude price up around 1%. So <strong>Royal Dutch Shell B</strong> shares added 115p to \u00a313.50, helped by Goldman Sachs raising its recommendation from neutral to buy, while<strong> BP</strong> bounced 34.25p to 431.75p.</p> <p>Most of the banks moved higher, apart from <strong>HBOS</strong> which fell 4.1p to 80p, compared to the 96p a share bid from <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong>, up 8.8p to 158.8p.</p> <p>Leisure group <strong>Whitbread </strong>lost 67.5p to 815p as Cazenove moved its recommendation from outperform to underperform. A warning from Coffee Republic about the tough economic environment was deemed to be bad news for Whitbread's Costa Coffee chain.</p> <p><strong>InterContinental Hotels</strong> fell 2.5p to 542p after downbeat comments from chief executive Andrew Cosslett at a conference in Hong Kong, while <strong>Next </strong> dipped 4p to 858p as Goldman Sachs removed the retailer from its pan-European buy list. High street chain <strong>Woolworths</strong> edged up 0.02p to 4.08p, despite news that Sir Alan Sugar had failed to buy 3.88% of the company as planned, because the proposed seller (thought to be Icelandic) could not deliver the shares. Sugar's stake is below the disclosable 3% limit.</p> <p>More signs that the credit crunch was hitting the real economy came with a host of profit warnings. These included car dealer <strong>Inchcape</strong>, down 48.75p to 78p, <strong>UK Coal</strong>, 68p lower at 132.25p and estate agents <strong>Savills</strong>, off 0.75p at 220p. Builders merchant Travis Perkins, which issued its own warning yesterday, lost another 49p to 281.25p.</p> <p><strong>Premier Foods</strong>, the Mr Kipling and Branston pickle company, fell more than 50% at one point on worries it might breach its banking covenants. The company quickly issued a statement denying this, and saying sales for the third quarter were up 9% on the previous year. It added it had no plans to issue any equity. The statement managed to do some good - the shares ended 15% lower at 29.75p.</p> <p>Finally computer games group <strong>SCi Entertainment</strong> closed 4.75p higher at 25p on speculation of a possible bid from Time Warner after the US group bought 5m new shares to take its stake to 16.13p.</p>",
  "<p>The billionaire media mogul <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/rupertmurdoch\">Rupert Murdoch</a> today railed against British regulators for dealing a \"huge injustice\" to BSkyB over a potentially costly bust-up surrounding the broadcaster's minority stake in rival ITV. </p> <p>Speaking at the annual meeting of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/newscorporation\">News Corporation</a> empire, Murdoch attacked the Competition Commission for ordering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bskyb\">BSkyB</a> to cut its 17.9% stake in ITV to less than 7.5%. </p> <p>\"The purchase of those shares in ITV was totally within the law,\" said Murdoch. \"It's a huge injustice that Sky has suffered and it's still subject to court review.\" </p> <p>The commission decided last year that BSkyB's substantial interest in ITV was anti-competitive and against the public interest. The ruling was backed by the former business secretary John Hutton and it was upheld by an official appeals tribunal last month. </p> <p>Murdoch told investors that BSkyB ought to be able to own up to 20%, citing a ceiling imposed by the 2003 Communications Act. </p> <p>He said he issue had been \"parked up with various quangos and committees\" and was not yet final. BSkyB is considering whether to take the issue to the appeals court. </p> <p>BSkyB bought the stock for \u00a3940m two years ago to foil a takeover of ITV by Virgin Media. It has been forced to write down the value of the investment by \u00a3616m because of a plunge in ITV's share price and BSkyB executives are deeply reluctant to sell at a depressed price. </p> <p>Addressing shareholders at New York's Hudson Theatre, Murdoch delivered a gloomy assessment of the global economy, acknowledging that the credit crunch has \"weakened advertising markets and beaten down our share price\". </p> <p>He insisted that News Corp's diversified interests and strong balance sheet left it well prepared for a downturn but said: \"2009 may be a year of unprecedented challenges - we cannot fool ourselves into pretending otherwise.\" </p> <p>There was little dissent among the 50 or so investors present except for a question over the appointment to News Corp's board of Natalie Bancroft, a 28-year-old opera singer, to represent the Bancroft family which sold the Wall Street Journal to Murdoch last year. </p> <p>An Australian shareholder activist asked if the meeting could hear from Bancroft on \"what values she adds to the board\", while another investor questioned whether she would stand up to her all-male, middle-aged boardroom colleagues. </p> <p>Murdoch replied that Bancroft, who lives in Europe, had already visited all branches of the company, saying: \"She's one of the most diligent new directors I've ever seen.\" </p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian at the meeting, Bancroft said her tender age was a strength: \"I'm young - this is a company driven by a younger market. I think I bring a youthful perspective.\" </p> <p>She declined to say how much time she was devoting to News Corp: \"I'm not calculating it in terms of days per month.

  "<p>The French government is to take sanctions against one of the country's biggest savings banks, the Caisse d'Epargne, after it suffered a \u20ac600m (\u00a3465m) loss on unauthorised equity derivatives trading.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, finance minister, today ordered an emergency audit of all French banks after the Caisse indicated that a team of four or five traders, since disciplined, exceeded their limits. \"She wants to make sure that what happened does not happen again,\" her spokesman said.</p> <p>They were caught out in last week's<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\"> stockmarket crash</a>, when panic seized traders and investors, by what the bank called \"routine control procedures\". The positions were immediately closed, the Caisse said.</p> <p>Lagarde said she was \"particularly frustrated and depressed\" by this latest incident of unauthorised trading to hit French banks as the country's banking commission began an investigation into the incident.</p> <p>The Caisse, which is merging with Banque Populaire to form France's second-largest retail bank and is known as \"the Squirrel\", is the third to be stung by losses caused by rogue traders.</p> <p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/04/banking\">Societe Generale</a>, took a \u20ac4.9bn hit on up to \u20ac50bn of futures positions allegedly run up by Jerome Kerviel while Credit Agricole last year lost \u20ac250m through a rogue trader based in the US.</p> <p>Lagarde said the government had been informed of the Caisse losses late on Thursday after being told of the incident the evening before.</p> <p>Ministers had then been steering legislation through parliament to set up the new bank refinancing company which has up to \u20ac320bn to guarantee bank loans - the latest European government to follow the British lead in bailing out banks in the wake of the credit crunch, with the German parliament approving the country's \u20ac500bn rescue package today.</p> <p>Lagarde's comments came after she attended the first meeting of the refinancing company which is chaired by former IMF managing director Michel Camdessus. France has also set aside \u20ac40bn of capital to inject into any ailing banks but has repeatedly insisted its banks are \"sound and robust\".</p> <p>The Caisse , which was already closing down its proprietary trading desk, earlier this month denied reports it was seeking a \u20ac6.5bn capital injection to offset huge trading losses. SocGen and semi-nationalised municipal lender Dexia issued similar denials this week.</p> <p>In a statement it said: \"In view of the size of its capital base - more than \u20ac20bn - and its substantial liquidity, this loss has no effect on the financial strength of the group and will have no impact on its customers.\"</p> <p>It is understood that an assistant of the rogue traders' team leader, Julien Carmona, has been dismissed. Others have been moved to different jobs.</p> <p>The French rogue trading came to light as Charlie McCreevy, EU internal market commissioner, ordered a regulatory crackdown on parts of the opaque $600 trillion derivatives market.</p> <p>Gordon Brown earlier this week urged global action to control the so-called over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading market which accounts for the vast majority of the total market and takes place between two parties off-exchange, largely to limit foreign exchange or interest rate risks.</p> <p>McCreevy, pointing to the surge in credit default swaps (CDS), said the OTC market could cause \"new tremors\" in current fragile market conditions if one of the parties involved could not meet their liabilities.</p> <p>He indicated that there should be a central clearing house for \"standardised\" derivatives and he could table EU legislation along these lines before the end of the year. \"No one is able to say how these swaps (CDSs) will unwind. Regulators have little sight of the potential liabilities that could be building up for individual participants,\" he said.</p> <p>Separately, Deutsche Bank confirmed that its executive board had agreed to waive any multimillion bonuses this year. The decision, affecting 10 directors, including Josef Ackermann, chief executive, who earned \u20ac14m last year, and Anshu Jain, City-based head of global markets, who earned even more, could more than halve the \u20ac97m they earned last year.</p>",
  "<p>Fresh signs of a recession in the US have dragged Wall Street lower in early trading, denting hopes of an easing in the world financial crisis.</p> <p>US consumer confidence fell to its lowest recorded level this month and the number of houses being built fell to a new seventeen and a half year low last month, down 6.3% to 817,000 and well below forecasts of 880,000. The gloomy news sent the Dow Jones industrial average down 117.6 points to 8861.6 in early trading. By lunchtime in New York the index had come back to 8961.1 - down 0.2% or 18 points.</p> <p>The fall in the Dow came after the latest attempt by President George Bush to reassure Americans that the government's $700bn bail-out of the banking system would work.</p> <p>Speaking before trading began in Wall Street, Bush said the credit system would take \"a while\" to thaw, but Americans should be confident that it would. </p> <p>\"If we had not acted, it was going to affect the American people directly,\" Bush told the US Chamber of Commerce. </p> <p>\"It took a while for the credit system to freeze up, it's going to take a while for the credit system to thaw. These decisive measures aimed at the heart of our financial challenges, they're big enough and bold enough to work. The American people can be confident that they will.\" </p> <p>He said the US was working with European countries to resolve the global crisis. \"We're determined to overcome this challenge together,\" he said. </p> <p>However, confidence in the economy among ordinary Americans has plunged in response to the financial crisis gripping the globe. The University of Michigan report showed a dive in its confidence index from 70.3 in September to 57.5. The measure, which averaged 85.6 in 2007, was lower than forecast.</p> <p>With falling house prices, rising repossessions and the credit crunch making it difficult to get mortgages, builders are cutting back on construction projects. Further cuts in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two- thirds of the economy, will deepen a recession. </p> <p>\"Even gasoline-price decreases were overpowered by the massive destruction of wealth,'' said Michael Feroli, an economist at JP Morgan. \"Things are pretty awful in the economy and that should make itself felt through weaker consumer spending.\"</p> <p>The news follows poor US industrial production figures yesterday. Dimitry Fleming at ING Bank said: \"There is little doubt that the housing crunch is still in full swing. This report pre-dates the financial crisis entering a next phase in October. So the next few months will show whether the bail-out plan is or is not helping the housing sector. </p> <p>\"The first glimpse is bad though, with builders' sentiment taking a battering in October, dropping three points to a new record low. Until new home sales stop diving, the best thing for homebuilders is to continue slashing production. Judging by today's report they understand this.\"</p> <p>Trading in London shrugged off the poor news from the US and the FTSE closed up 201 points at 4063 - a 5.2% gain.</p> <p>All the major banks except HBOS were trading up as the sector benefited from a sharp fall in overnight interbank lending rates and optimism that the government's bail-out plan would succeed. However, insurers, thought by some to be the next sector to feel the pressure of the credit crunch, were down sharply, led by Norwich Union owner Aviva, down 17%, and Standard Life, down 6%.</p>",
  "<p>Rich countries should try to cut the greenhouse gas emissions caused by deforestation by first investing in the people who live and use forests, rather than relying on the financial carbon markets to encourage conservation, leading development experts have proposed. </p> <p>If not, they risk unleashing a wave of land grabs, corruption, cultural destruction and civil conflict, said the Washington-based <a href=\"http://www.rightsandresources.org/\">Rights and Resources Initiative</a>, a coalition of of UN- and government-funded research organisations including the World Conservation Union and the <a href=\"http://www.cifor.cgiar.org/\">Center for International Forestry Research</a> (Cifor). </p> <p>The loss of trees is responsible for almost a fifth of the world's emissions of carbon dioxide \u2013 stopping and reducing it is seen as one of the quickest and cheapest ways of cutting emissions</p> <p>The call for human rights to be put at the centre of the issue came after Johan Eliasch, Gordon Brown's special adviser on forests, proposed this week that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/14/greenpolitics-climatechange\">tropical forests be included in future carbon markets</a>. </p> <p>UN climate change negotiators are trying to set up a new financial mechanism, known as <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/intersessional/awg_4_and_dialogue_4/press/application/pdf/awg4_com_plus_red.pdf\">Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation</a> (Redd) which could generate billions of dollars a year for reducing forest loss in the tropics.</p> <p>But initial findings of World Bank-commissioned research presented at a conference in Oslo, Norway, suggest it will cost far less to save carbon by recognising forest community rights rather than relying on the future money markets. </p> <p>A study by Jeffrey Hatcher, an analyst with Rights and Resources in Washington, found that it costs about $3.50 (\u00a32) per hectare to recognise forest people's land. The costs of protecting forests under Redd have been estimated as about \u00a32,000 per hectare. </p> <p>\"There is lots of evidence from around the world that communities conserve their forests when their [land] rights are recognised. There are now about 400m hectares of forest formally owned by communities. These 400m hectares conserve about 20-40m Gigatonnes of CO2. This means that it costs about $1.6bn (\u00a3925m) to achieve this conservation. The Eliasch review suggested it would cost about $17bn year to to stop deforestation, which works out as far more expensive\", said Hatcher. </p> <p>Norway's Minister of Environment and International Development, Erik Solheim, said that efforts towards reduced emissions from deforestation in developing countries should be based on the rights of indigenous people to the forests they depend on for their livelihoods, and should provide tangible benefits to them consistent with their essential role in sustainable forest management.</p> <p>\"In addition to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, early action, pilot projects and demonstrations should safeguard biodiversity, contribute to poverty reduction and secure the rights of forest-dependent communities in order to achieve any degree of permanence, legitimacy and effectiveness,\" said Solheim.</p> <p>The UK and Norwegian governments pledged \u00a3108m earlier this year to protect the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/17/forests.endangeredhabitats\">forests of the Congo basin</a>.</p>",
  "<h2>The short, sharp shock - the V-shaped recession</h2> <p>Gordon Brown's bank rescue plans work like magic. Interest rates are slashed to 3.5% by Christmas and after the festive season confidence returns to the banks and they start to lend again. Interest rates are slashed further, to 2.5% by the summer. House price stabilise as buyers come back and consumer and business confidence turns up. </p> <p>Companies report lower profits, but there are not big collapses. Commodity prices stabilise. Oil goes to $60 and stays there, helping bring inflation down to 2%. A few emerging-market economies have similar wobbles to Iceland but get assistance from the International Monetary Fund. The global economy is helped by only a mild slowdown in China and unemployment in India peaks at 2.5 million. The FTSE 100 is back over 5000 by next summer.</p> <h2>Five years of gloom - the U-shaped recession</h2> <p>Banks remain reluctant to lend as a harsh new regulatory regime bites. Lenders focus on only the safest loans to the best risks. Interest rates are cut to 2.5% by the summer, but banks do not pass the lower rate on to borrowers in order to rebuild their profits and capital bases. </p> <p>Some banks require further capital injections. Policymakers run out of ideas. Chinese economic growth slows, inflation remains and unemployment hits 3 million. The FTSE 100 is locked in the 3300-3800 range. Repossessions rise and properties lose 40% of their value. There are numerous company failures. The enterprise culture appears dead. But after five years, the first green shoots of recovery start to appear.</p> <h2>The double-dipper - the W-shaped recession</h2> <p>It looks just like the short sharp shock, but Opec cuts production and there is a new drought in wheat-producing regions. At the same time pay demands take off and inflation re-emerges. </p> <p>The Bank of England's monetary policy commmittee lifts interest rates. Consumers lose confidence and struggle to repay their debts. A new round of bank write-offs begins. Repossession rates and corporate failures climb again.</p> <h2>The lost decade - the L-shaped recession</h2> <p>As witnessed after the Japanese banking crisis: today's inflation turns to next year's deflation. The banks remain reluctant to lend and consumers struggle to repay their loans. Bad debts mount, house prices fall 40% after a sharp drop and then a sustained drift. Corporate failures are at a record rate and unemployment reaches 3.5 million. </p> <p>House repossessions rise as borrowers lose their jobs. There are bank failures and a couple of insurance companies topple over. The US is also in deep recession and the Chinese economy faces a hard landing. The FTSE 100 index dips to 3000 - another 25% down on today's levels and more than 50% below its 2007 peak - and fails to recover.</p> <h2>Armageddon</h2> <p>A new war in the Middle East pushes oil prices into the stratosphere. Central banks have to raise interest rates to combat inflation. Most major economies tip into depression.</p> <p>Banking systems in many countries collapse, leading to widespread chaos as people are unable to access their money or pay for anything. Riots ensue and long queues appear outside soup kitchens as governments put soldiers on the streets to maintain order. Unemployment exceeds the peak seen in the 1930s. </p> <p>Overall world output falls for more than a decade. It's the worst depression the world has ever seen.</p>",

A 60% reduction therefore requires that UK emissions should go down by 96.9m tonnes by 2050, and that implies that emissions should decrease on average about 1.62m tonnes a year. On that basis carbon emissions should have been reduced by some 16.2m tonnes over the last decade since 1997. They haven't. They've gone up.</p> <p>If we have failed so dramatically, so far, with the 60% reduction target, why should we be any more likely to hit an 80% reduction target? The real test is not turning out ever more radical targets, but putting in place effective mechanisms which will make certain we reach more modest targets, and then even tougher mechanisms to make certain we reach tougher targets. Britain's problem, which we share with many other countries, is that we have done the opposite.</p> <p>We are actually putting in place mechanisms which will ensure we do not reach even the modest targets, let alone the more stringent ones actually needed. The government has committed itself to trebling airport capacity in the UK by 2030 which, if it happens, will neutralise their entire carbon-cutting programme in every other sector. The government, or at least the Department for Business, is committed to building the first coal-fired power station in this country for decades, at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorth\">Kingsnorth</a> in Kent, even though coal is the most polluting fuel of all and carbon capture and storage technology needed to filter out the pollution is nowhere in sight.</p> <p>Gordon Brown is determined to go ahead with a new round of nuclear power station building, which will crowd out the desperately needed promotion of renewables in this country. We have more wind and wave and tidal power capacity in the UK than anywhere else in Europe, yet we currently generate just 4% of our electricity from renewables compared with 10-25% in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, and 35-50% in Scandinavia. Yet the government is actually this year trying to whittle down the EU's renewables target for the UK.</p> <p>The government is still opposed to bringing the airline industry into the ambit of the Kyoto Protocol (or even into the current <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/climatechangehl.html\">climate change bill</a>), and has no effective programme for promoting carbon-neutral cars. Industry is still not required to report annually sector by sector on its emissions, and to be transparent about reducing them year by year. Household carbon allowances have been mooted, but nothing practical has been done. And the government is still doing all it can to extend the fossil fuel era, as most dramatically illustrated by the announcement that it is annexing one-third of a million square miles of the sea bed off Antarctica because it may hold repositories of oil and gas.</p> <p>An 80% reduction target by 2050 is great. But don't expect it to be greeted with anything other than a hollow laugh so long as nearly all the government's other policies are pointed in the opposite direction.</p>",

  "<p>Countries could protect nature, help halt climate change, and provide food and clean water for a billion people for little more than has been pledged to bail out the world's banks in the last week, according to a series of authoritative economic reports from the UN, world bodies, major charities and banks.</p> <p>Estimates of the sum committed this week by governments to rescue the world's financial system range between $2-4tr. Investment on this scale to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect nature would not only be repaid up to 100 times over, say the studies, but would also save trillions of dollars having to be spent later.</p> <p>So what could investment on the scale of the the bank bail-out money buy?</p> <p><strong>Climate change:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/04/politics.greenpolitics\">Lord Nicholas Stern</a>, who led the UK government's study of the economic costs and benefits of climate change said it would cost 1% of global GDP, or $540bn (\u00a3313bn) a year, to hold greenhouse gas emissions at a level to avoid the worst effects of global climate change. But his review for the Treasury in 2006 said that if countries did not act, the overall costs and risks of climate change would soar into trillions of dollars a year.</p> <p><strong>Ecosystems and biodiversity: </strong>A study on the costs and benefits of investing in the wealth of nature has provisionally found that most of the world's forests, mountains, rivers and seas could be protected for about $45bn annually, says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/climatechange-marketturmoil\">Pavan Sukhdev, lead author of the EU and German government-funded report</a>.</p> <p>\"The economic arguments for nature protection are beginning to enter mainstream thinking,\" said Sukdev, whose team is due to report fully next year. Last month the team estimated that the loss of the services that the forests perform, such as providing clean water and absorbing carbon dioxide is already costing the global economy $2-5tr a year.</p> <p>Another major study,<a href=\"http://cms.iucn.org/index.cfm?uNewsID=585\"> by Shell economists working with the World Conservation Union this year</a>, estimated it would cost $1.3tr, spread over 30 years, to protect the world's most important ecosystems. For this sum, nearly 15% of land and 30% of the oceans would be protected from illegal logging, overfishing, pollution and would go most of the way to protecting the most endangered animals. </p> <p><strong><br>Renewable energy:</strong> Switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources in the US alone would not only reduce the world's carbon emissions by nearly 20% but could provide hundreds of thousands of jobs, says <a href=\"http://knol.google.com/k/-/-/15x31uzlqeo5n/1\">Jeffery Greenblatt, Google's climate and energy manager.</a> </p> <p>In a major study, Greenblatt proposes spending $4.4tr, spread over 30 years, to replace all the US's coal and oil-fired electricity generation renewable electricity. The Google plan would generate 380 gigawatts (gW) of wind power, 250gW of solar power and 80gW of geothermal power, as well as reduce US energy use by 33% and boost sales of plug-in hybrid vehicles to 90% of new car sales by 2030.</p> <p>Britain's more modest plan to generate 36% of all electricity from renewable sources by 2020 is roughly costed by the Treasury at $100bn, over 12 years. </p> <p><strong>Water and sanitation:</strong> International charity WaterAid this week estimated that providing safe water and sanitation to the 2.5 billion people in the world without it would cost \u00a337.5bn. This, said a spokeswomen, was about equal to the amount (\u00a337bn) given by UK government to RBS, HBOS and Lloyds TSB on Monday.</p> <p><strong>Hunger</strong>: Earlier this year, Jacques Diouf, head of the UN's food and agriculture organisation, said it would cost around $30bn a year to avert all future threats of conflicts over food. \"How can we explain to people of good sense and good faith that it was not possible to find US$30bn a year to enable 862 million hungry people to enjoy the most fundamental of human rights: the right to food and thus the right to life?\" he said. </p> <p>Greenpeace senior climate campaigner, Jim Footner, said: \"This [bail out] money just shows how fast and how decisively the government can act when it faces a crisis. The onset of climate change is crisis of equal severity, and should tackled with a similar level of urgency and ambition. </p> <p>\"The scientists tell us we have less than 100 months before global emissions must peak and then begin to fall, and if we are to achieve this then we need massive investment in renewables and energy efficiency schemes and we must stop burning coal in conventional power plants. If we can find \u00a350bn overnight for the bankers, then we can find the necessary finance and political will to lead ourselves out of the climate change crisis.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Additional reporting by Niki Nixon</p>",
  "<p><strong>July 1887, Glasgow, Scotland </strong> <br>The first windmill for electricity production is built by Professor James Blyth of Anderson's College, Glasgow (now Strathclyde University).

In 1903, Poul la Cour founded the Society of Wind Electricians and in 1904 the society held the first course in wind electricity. La Cour was the first to discover that fast rotating wind turbines with fewer rotor blades were most efficient in generating electricity production.</p> <p><strong>1927 \u2013 Minneapolis, US</strong><br>Joe and Marcellus Jacobs open the Jacobs Wind factory, producing wind turbine generators. The generators are used on farms to charge batteries and power lighting.</p> <p><strong>1920s </strong><br>The first vertical axis wind turbine, the Darrieus turbine, is invented by Frenchman George Darrieus who in 1931 has it patented in the US.

The turbine has a 30m tower and a 32% load factor, meaning it provides 32% of its potential energy output, pretty good even by today's standards.</p> <p><strong>1941 \u2013 Vermont, US</strong><br>The world's first megawatt wind turbine is built and connected to the power grid in Castleton, Vermont. The turbine has 75-foot blades and weighs 240 tons.</p> <p><strong>1956 \u2013 Gedser, Denmark</strong><br>The Gedser wind turbine is built by Johannes Juul, a former student of Poul la Cour. The 200kW, three-bladed turbine inspired many later turbine designs, and Juul's invention - emergency aerodynamic tip breaks \u2013 is still used in turbines today. The turbine operated until 1967 and was refurbished in the mid 1970s at the request of Nasa.</p> <p><strong>1970s \u2013 Ohio, US</strong><br>The United States government, led by Nasa, begins research into large commercial wind turbines.

  "<p>One of the great claims about the internet has always been that it doesn't respect borders. John Perry Barlow, in his \"<a href=\"http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html\">declaration of cyberspace independence</a>\" \u2013 written way back in 1996 \u2013 claimed that national governments couldn't hold sway against the determined electrons of cyberspace: \"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours,\" he wrote.</p> <p>And then we have a week like this, in which police forces acting for those boring nation-based governments shut down some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/oct/16/spam-usa\">spammers allegedly responsible for generating one-third of all the world's spam</a>, and then a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/oct/17/identity-fraud-darkmarket\">scammers' website where criminals traded stolen bank and card details</a>.</p> <p>Sounds like a bit of a win there for the nation state. Though to be fair, Barlow was writing a long time before the spammers and scammers had really discovered the net, and trying to make a point about free speech.</p> <p>What's also interesting is that the geeks' favoured solutions \u2013 technological ones \u2013 really didn't work. Bill Gates famously <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/jan/25/billgates.spam\">pronounced that spam would be solved</a>, and put Microsoft's brightest (well, I hope they were the brightest: how would you feel if you were drafted into it, looked around and realised everyone else on the antispam team was an also-ran?) into coming up with ways to beat it through technical fixes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/aug/26/newmedia.it1\">such as SPF</a>.</p> <p>Didn't work. Spam kept growing.</p> <p>Antivirus companies have been selling people products to safeguard their machines against trojans, bots and so on for years. Hasn't stopped a dramatic number of machines being infected (though one has to accept that more would have been infected than without), and people's details stolen. There have been more than 60 arrests so far.</p> <p>I score that as 2-0 to solutions based on law rather than technology. True, the technological fixes are often quicker \u2013 but they don't discourage in the way that say, a jail sentence or even the process of having your assets, computers and possessions seized, frozen and inspected by the police will. And with the greater transparency being forced on banks all around the world, it becomes harder for the illicit gains to be stashed away.</p> <p>It has taken some while for the law to catch up. There was the way that the creator of the Love Bug virus (the first that really had a global impact) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/08/philippines\">got off scot-free</a> because there were no laws in the Philippines against writing viruses. The author of the Melissa virus (which preceded Love Bug) was <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/melissaSent.htm\">sentenced to 20 months in jail</a>. But it is common in a field that's rapidly developing that the law takes a while to pull on its shoes and socks. Driving under the influence of alcohol (as opposed to being completely drunk) hasn't been illegal forever; in England (I'm astonished to have discovered in the course of writing this piece) <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=BuzNzm-x0l8C&amp;pg=PA211&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=drunk+driving+law+first+introduced+england+1967&amp;source=web&amp;ots=zuaGgdk26m&amp;sig=k4g6l7E3j67gI2asevLMtcy6rN4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result\">strict limits were only introduced in 1967</a>.</p> <p>But once you have laws in place, the game changes. That's the difference between technology and law. When you introduce a new technology \u2013 such as the internet \u2013 it creates huge, rippling effects on society as a whole. You can't predict them, and it's probably wiser not to try. But you can predict that criminals will try to exploit its downside, just as entrepreneurs will try to exploits its benefits.</p> <p>The wave washes over society, and then the ripples become smaller; we've integrated it into our lives. The internet hasn't finished overturning how we live, but it's a lot clearer what role it has. And that's where the law finally has a chance to catch up.</p> <p>Even so, governments have a way to go. The FBI in the US has done well, but in the UK the government hasn't shown enough signs that it's really au fait with what's going on. Richard Clayton, a security researcher at Cambridge University and one of the writers of the Light Blue Touchpaper blog, <a href=\"http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2008/10/02/epolicing-tomorrow-the-world/\">notes</a> that earlier this month the Home Office <a href=\"http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/new-specialist-ecrime-unit\">announced</a> there will be a <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/pceu/index.htm\">Police Central e-Crime unit (PCeU)</a>, which \u2013 once it's operating next spring \u2013 will be able to tackle crime that's not big enough for the Serious and Organised Crimes Agency (which helped in the arrest of the ID fraudsters' ring), yet not localised enough for local police.</p> <p>Clayton thinks there's still a way to go, and points to Bonnie and Clyde \u2013 whose 1930s' inter-state bank robberies created jurisdictional problems, until robbing banks was made a federal rather than state crime \u2013 as the classic pre-internet example. </p> <p>As Clayton notes, we do have modern Bonnie and Clydes, \"with criminals in one country fleecing consumers in another while using systems hosted in a third\".</p> <p>But he says the problem isn't being tackled properly. \"What isn't happening, or at least only in a handful of very specialised areas, is any international cooperation in setting priorities or selecting cases to pursue. Every country is doing its own thing about e-crime, and there's a widespread impression that any criminal who can operate from 'across the state line' is essentially immune from serious investigation.\"</p> <p>Well, that might have felt like it was true earlier this month. But maybe this week marks the beginning of a change in cooperative policing. It's about time, after all.</p>",

  "<p>Once again the Dallas Cowboys stole the headlines. More often than not trade deadline day in the NFL is about as eventful as <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=SWgg20IqibM\">the world staring championships</a>, but this year Cowboys owner Jerry Jones looked on it as a final opportunity. Fearing for his team's Super Bowl prospects after two defeats in three games, Jones gave up his team's first, third and sixth round picks in next year's draft to acquire wide receiver Roy Williams and a seventh-round pick from the Detroit Lions on Wednesday.</p> <p>At a glance it looks like a lot to pay for a receiver who has gained over 1,000 yards only once in four seasons, and who has hauled in an underwhelming 17 catches for 232 yards and one touchdown so far in five games this year. The consensus among team owners, together in Florida this week for the annual league owners' meetings, was that Jones had overpaid. Most Dallas commentators agreed. Some openly wondered if he had only made the move to distract attention from the league's decision to <a href=\"http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/news.cfm?id=02FD7830-E853-B954-3C2187835B106C31\">indefinitely suspend cornerback Adam \"Pacman\" Jones</a>. </p> <p>Certainly there is risk associated with handing over two such high picks (the swapping of sixth and seventh picks is unlikely to make a huge difference, especially given that the Lions will likely be picking early and the Cowboys late in each round). Cowboys fans will recall the trade Jones made ahead of the 2000 season for Joey Galloway, when he gave up two first-round picks only to see the receiver tear his ACL during his first game and miss the rest of the season. </p> <p>And yet this may be a better deal than many have given Jones credit for. Williams is a tall, powerful receiver who is fast enough to stretch the field on deep routes. He went to the Pro Bowl in 2007 and would have broken 1,000 yards receiving again last season were it not for injury forcing him to miss four games. He is also only 26, and in the long run should become Terrell Owens' successor. </p> <p>Better yet, Williams truly wants to be there. \"I am more happy than when I got my first bike,\" he reflected after the deal was completed, and his delight stemmed from more than just leaving a team that had won 21 games and lost 48 since he arrived. Williams was a childhood Cowboys fan, one who grew up in Texas playing at Permian High (of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Friday-Night-Lights-Town-Dream/dp/0224076744/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1224245251&amp;sr=1-1\">Friday Night Lights</a> fame) and then the University of Texas. </p> <p>Concern lingers over how Owens will react to sharing the limelight with a man who is expected to eventually oust him as the Cowboys' No1 receiver, but for now he is making all the right noises, insisting he has only ever cared about winning. Besides, T.O. has hardly been setting the world alight of late, and if nothing else Williams' presence will ensure he faces less of the double-coverage he has complained about in recent weeks. Whether or not it will help him get over his less-discussed struggles in dealing with simple press coverage from lone cornerbacks this season remains to be seen. </p> <p>Besides, there are greater problems for this Cowboys team right now. As well as Pacman \u2013 who is <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3646257\">reportedly planning to attend an 'alcohol treatment facility'</a> \u2013 the Cowboys will be without running back Felix Jones for at least another two weeks as he struggles with a hamstring injury, and punter Mat McBriar for the rest of the season after he fractured his foot when his punt was blocked in overtime against the Arizona Cardinals. </p> <p>And then there's Tony Romo. Team doctors said the Cowboys quarterback would miss three to four weeks after breaking the little finger on his throwing hand against the Cardinals, but after calling \u2013 and you'll like this \u2013 Brett Favre for advice, Romo now wants to play this weekend against the Rams. To do so would be beyond foolish. Back-up Brad Johnson is more than capable of leading the Cowboys past a Rams team who, despite last week's upset of the Washington Redskins, just aren't very good. Doctors have warned that Romo could aggravate the injury by playing, and frankly he might be more of a liability than an asset if his grip on the ball has been weakened. Bear in mind this is a man who has fumbled six times already this season. </p> <p>\"Being fairly familiar with the personal bios of Favre, Jones, [head coach] Wade Phillips and [Romo], none are med school graduates,\" writes Randy Galloway in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. \"Those associated with the team who are certified doctors issued on Monday a shutdown timetable of four weeks on Romo. They didn't do this because they are fans of Brad Johnson. Thanks, Tony, for attempting to be manly. But the immediate answer to Romo's request has to be, 'shut the bleep up and rehab, then we'll re-evaluate next week.'\"</p> <p>Phillips has told the press he won't inform them of his decision on Romo before the game. If his intention is to play mind-games with the 1-4 Rams, then one can only assume <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2008/oct/10/nfl-ussport\">paranoia in Dallas</a> is even worse than previously thought. </p> <p>But the Cowboys weren't the only team trying to make moves on deadline day. The Indianapolis Colts agreed a deal to acquire defensive tackle John McCargo from the Buffalo Bills, only for the move to collapse when he failed a medical. But the greater surprise was the failure of the Kansas City Chiefs to come to terms with any of the teams chasing tight end Tony Gonzalez. </p> <p>\"I'm not the first guy that's felt like he's been wronged around here,\" said Gonzalez yesterday, making no secret of his anger at Chiefs president Carl Peterson. Gonzalez wanted to be traded to a playoff contender, and believed the Chiefs should have accepted an offer of a third-round pick from the Green Bay Packers. \"I'm 32 years old,\" he continued. \"A second-round pick, you're not going to get that.\" </p> <p>It appears now that the Packers had included a number of stipulations in their offer that the Chiefs were unhappy with, and it has been reported that they may even have had to return draft picks to Green Bay if Gonzalez didn't meet certain performance-related criteria. Nevertheless, failing to work out a trade serves nobody. Gonzalez, who has now caught for more yards than any other tight end in NFL history, could have helped a playoff team get better. These Chiefs are going to post a losing record with or without him. Looking forward, they could do with all the draft picks they can get.</p>",
  "<p>Recorded just over a decade ago, this is an emotional reminder that the short-lived Cuban supergroup really did justify their global reputation. The set includes 10 songs that appeared on their one studio album, with versions of those rousing favourites Chan Chan and El Cuarto de Tula, which is driven on by some inspired guitar work from Eliades Ochoa, through to the late Ibrahim Ferrer's exquisite bolero Dos Gardenias. Then there are six other songs that didn't appear on that first recording, and which provide a reminder of the band's remarkable range. Four of these pieces are from the repertoire of that extraordinary pianist, the late Rub\u00e9n Gonzalez, who demonstrates his rhythmic playing and freewheeling improvisations.

  "<p>Legendary investor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/warrenbuffett\">Warren Buffett</a> has given a resounding vote of confidence to the US stockmarket, saying that now is a great time to \"buy a slice of America's future at a marked-down price\".</p> <p>After global equities suffered another bruising week, Buffett revealed that he is now buying US stocks with his own money. He predicted that shares would \"substantially\" outperform cash as an investment type over the next decade.</p> <p>Writing in the New York Times, the Sage of Omaha echoed his famous motto \u2013 to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.</p> <p>\"Most certainly, fear is now widespread, gripping even seasoned investors,\" wrote Buffett, who has built a reputation for sound investing over several decades.</p> <p>\"To be sure, investors are right to be wary of highly leveraged entities or businesses in weak competitive positions. But fears regarding the long-term prosperity of the nation's many sound companies make no sense. These businesses will indeed suffer earnings hiccups, as they always have. But most major companies will be setting new profit records five, 10 and 20 years from now,\" he predicted.</p> <p>On Thursday market volatility hit an all-time high, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX. This so-called \"fear gauge\" reached 81%, four times its level in the August panic.</p> <p>Five years ago Buffett warned that derivatives were \"financial weapons of mass destruction\". Subsequent events have proved him right again, with credit default swaps adding to the panic in the marketplace.</p> <p>In words that could encourage small investors back into the market, Buffett warned that people who hold cash equivalents have opted for a \"terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value\".</p> <p>He said that while he had \"no idea\" what the market would do in the short term: \"I'll follow the lead of a restaurant that opened in an empty bank building and then advertised: 'Put your mouth where your money was.' Today my money and my mouth both say equities.\"</p> <p>The Dow Jones index has now fallen by almost 5200 points, or 36%, since hitting an all-time high of 14164.</p> <p>It is expected to give back some of the gains it racked up in a 4.7% rally yesterday when trading begins this afternoon.</p> <p><strong>Getting tough on the City</strong></p> <p>The FTSE 100 index has now fallen by over 40% since its recent high of 6732 points in June 2007.</p> <p>With banks leading the fallers \u2013 Royal Bank of Scotland's shares are 85% lower than a year ago \u2013 there is mounting pressure to reform the sector to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis caused by the credit crunch.

  "<p>Match-fixing? Eh? World Cup qualifiers? What? In Sheffield this past two weeks nothing has been on the agenda except this Sunday. 1.15pm. Hillsborough. The Steel City derby. As the United manager Kevin Blackwell put it this week: \"It isn't just a game, it's <em>the</em> game.\"</p> <p>The prospect of the derby match is one that fills fans with a mixture of anticipation, sickness, excitement and fear. Writing this now (with my Blades bobble hat on) I am filled with a vague nausea, most likely stirred up by memories of last season's game in S6, when, as the Wednesday faithful were keen to point out, it could well have been 10-0. Yet, for all the nerves, for all the misery in defeat, it's something that no fan would swap. Whether in Sheffield, Liverpool, Birmingham, Norfolk, Tyneside, Bristol, the south coast or north London, there's nothing quite like annoying the neighbours.</p> <p>These days derby games are perhaps more important than ever - they help root clubs in their communities. They're not about selling shirts in Asia, improving your business portfolio or any other global footballing enterprise involving pounds and pence. They're rarely about league position. To the outsider, they're an irrelevance, something to be treated with mild interest or, more likely, total indifference. To those involved, they're everything. Nothing. Else. Matters.</p> <p>If anyone understands the game's importance it's the Sheffield Wednesday captain Richard Wood. The Yorkshire-born central defender joined the Owls as a 10-year-old and sat in the stands as a teenager watching the Wednesday teams of David Pleat, Ron Atkinson and Danny Wilson. On Sunday he'll lead Brian Laws' team out for one of the biggest games of the season.</p> <p>\"I never expected it, it's like a dream come true,\" he says. \"It's what you want to play football for, big games like this. And with our squad we've got quite a few young lads who've come up through the academy and they all support Wednesday. So half of our team really know what it is all about. And all the other players do as well, because obviously it's a local derby and one of the biggest in the country.\"</p> <p>Talking to Wood it's clear that the players are champing at the bit. There's an urgency in his voice that you rarely hear from footballers. He ends several several answers with \"I can't wait\". The paintballing breaks and team-building go-kart races that often fill the international breaks for those left behind have been off the agenda this past fortnight. In their place, two weeks of training designed specifically to prepare the players for the hurly burly of Sunday.</p> <p>United have also been meticulous in their preparation \u2013 \"We know our jobs inside out,\" said the Blades skipper Chris Morgan this week - and also have their fair share of local lads in the first XI, United supporter Billy Sharp among them. And for once both sides come into the game in decent form. United have won three on the bounce since their humiliation against the Arsenal Creche XI, while Wednesday, despite a tendency to implode away from home (their three defeats this season have been 4-1, 6-0 and 4-0 reverses at Wolves, Reading and Plymouth), have three wins and two draws from their five games at Hillsborough.</p> <p>Then there are the managers \u2013 for the first time in a long time both sets of fans have opposition bosses worth a derogatory chant or two. While United had Neil Warnock \u2013 a Hillsborough hate figure because of his success and his lifelong support of the Blades (and, of course, because of the fact that he's Neil Warnock) - Wednesday managers Paul Sturrock and Chris Turner struggled to inspire the ire on the United terraces, Sturrock perhaps because of his happy hobo likeability, Turner because of his utter lack of success (in his one full season, the Owls finished within three points of a drop into League Two). In Brian Laws, though, United fans again have a worthy target. In two years in charge, Laws has been steadily improving his side and last year became the first Wednesday manager to win a Steel City derby game since 2002. His Mourinho-esque scarf-waving celebration of Wednesday's second goal did much to endear him to the blue half of the city, and put the horns and red trident on his image on the red half.</p> <p>But while Laws was doing his bit to fill the void left by Warnock in the city, United had a manager more unpopular at Bramall Lane that at Hillsborough. Bryan Robson lasted less than a month after his side's capitulation in the derby of January this year. Kevin Blackwell, who joined Laws on local radio this week for a phone-in during which each manager attempted to outdo the other in winding up the opposition's supporters, will hope his name is sung by the away end <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jan/21/match.sheffieldunited\">rather than Hillsborough's home terraces</a>.</p> <p>\"He loves this sort of game,\" says Wood of Laws. \"He loves the press attention that we get this week, the build-up. He loves giving out banter to Kevin Blackwell and he loves getting the fans on his side. He's a good manager to have, he encourages the lads, helps the lads out and when you can see that your manager is really up for it, it rubs off on the players.\"</p> <p>And to add the chunk of semtex to an already explosive mix, the sides are separated by just two points at the right end of the Championship. Like Wood, I can't wait.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/16/greenpolitics-edmiliband\">statement by the new secretary of state for energy and climate change, Ed Miliband</a>, making Britain's emissions reduction target even more ambitious took many by surprise. We have now pledged to reduce our emissions not by 60% but by 80% by 2050, a massive cut from 1990 levels.<br><br>On a day where other European countries were seeking to lower their own carbon reduction targets and the world remained focused on economic volatility, Miliband's statement was bold and welcome. </p> <p>Some argue that now isn't the time to push the green agenda - that all efforts should be on preventing a serious recession. That is a false choice. It fails to recognise that climate change and our carbon reliance is part of problem \u2013 high fuel prices and food shortages due to poor crop yields compound today's financial difficulties. And probably the biggest threat to our future economy is climate change and energy insecurity. </p> <p>What's more, setting and enshrining in law such green ambitions, along with creating a policy framework around them, will help to create jobs, trade and industries of the future.</p> <p>In the industrial revolution Britain led the world in advances that enabled mass production: trade exchanges, transportation, factory technology and new skills needed for the new industrialised world. With the right kind of investment, incentives and stimulus there's no reason we can't once again lead the world in advancements to enable the low-carbon revolution that is necessary to come into being.</p> <p>We have a strong and growing science base. We have now created a planning framework that enables faster growth in renewable energies. We are providing incentives for household and business energy saving. But we must do more. </p> <p>It's not a matter of if economies around the world becoming low-carbon, but when and how: through struggle and strife or through advancement and progressive leadership. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/17/globaleconomy-banking\">Larry Elliot described it today as the \"Green New Deal\"</a>. It's a leadership we in Britain can provide, and from which our economy can benefit.</p> <p>A global deal will only be possible if Britain plays its part, leading the way with other developed countries. </p> <p>Based on both the timing and the content of Miliband's first statement as the new climate change secretary, I am confident that we have the bold and challenging leadership we need.</p>",
  "<p>Is David Cameron at liberty to attack Gordon Brown's economic record as chancellor and prime minister? Of course he is. That's what we pay an opposition for: to oppose. He also produced a joke I hadn't heard.</p> <p>Yet to hear some of this morning's talk about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/17/davidcameron-politicalnews\">breaking the \"political truce\" during a financial crisis</a>, you'd think he'd done something terrible like push the Brown kids off their tricycles and grazed their tiny knees.<br><br>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/17/davidcameron-economy\">Tory leader's breakfast speech</a> at the all-singing-all-dancing high-tech Bloomberg News HQ in London (politicians seem to love all those flashing lights and glass) is actually rather a good one in its overall analysis. It's been a tricky week, what with having to support Saviour Brown's rescue plan, now being franchised everywhere. Today Dave's getting back into the game.</p> <p>We could pick holes in it - as I intend to in a moment. But its condemnation of Britain as a case of \"irresponsible capitalism presided over by an irresponsible government\" is as likely to upset rightwing Tory activists and the Daily Telegraph as it will the Brown bunker. </p> <p>Its tone is pragmatic \u2013 almost New Labour. Dave's complaint is that Blair and Brown abandoned socialism and fell for capitalism as a magical little black box. Free markets are essential, but never enough: they need to be regulated by people who know stuff, he explains.</p> <p>Cameron exaggerates, of course, when he writes off Brown's decade at No 11 as a \"complete and utter failure\". It's much more complicated than that. I lunched this week with the Engineering Employers' Federation where they were sombre about the economy, but basically in good fettle.</p> <p>\"In contrast to the popular image of decline, UK manufacturing has restructured itself in recent years and is now an increasingly high-value, high-skill sector of the economy\" with two-thirds of its output exported, says EEF publicity. </p> <p>Its officials have a direct line into government policy on everything from skills to taxes \u2013 and would do if Cameron and George Osborne were in charge. Osborne was a recent guest, they tell me, and impressed them more than some listeners expected. But they also respect Brown as a serious and clever man.</p> <p>But Cameron is surely right to complain that the financial boom \u2013 fuelled by cheap Asian goods and floods of Asian savings \u2013 led to gross irresponsibility in the west's financial services industries, on which governments should have called time. </p> <p>As a result Britons and their government went on an unsustainable spending spree. Hence Dave's joke, that the Consumer Price Index introduced by Brown - unlike the old RPI it does not include housing costs \u2013 is known as the \"China Price Index\". China's modernisation allowed it all to happen.</p> <p>True enough, but all governments colluded with the bubble in varying degrees. If Cameron thinks Brown was a socialist big spender who \"didn't fix the roof when the sun was shining\" he should check out that rightwing politician George W Bush \u2013 whose debt legacy will be even worse than Reagan and Bush Sr bequeathed to Bill Clinton. </p> <p>We could note in passing, incidentally, that then-chancellor Ken Clarke spent the 1997 election campaign denying our taunts - I did a bit of taunting myself - that he had dangerously ducked putting up interest rates for election purposes and that whoever won would have to put them up right away. Which is what happened.</p> <p>My second complaint? That he claims the left is saying that capitalism has failed and that state intervention is the permanent answer. Well, no, Jon McDonnell may say that, decent man that he is, but the real answer is more nuanced. Better regulation, if you prefer. Check out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/17/marketturmoil-banking\">the interview Adair Turner, the technocratic new chairman of the FSA, did with my colleague Larry Elliott</a> today.</p> <p>Turner, incidentally, makes the point that if the FSA had demanded more and better paid staff with which to set about party pooping the bubble before it burst the City would have complained that interference was ruining its global edge. Alan Greenspan's memoirs made the same complaint. Remember the Bears Sterns banker who said he \"had to keep partying until the music stops\"? He's flipping burgers now.</p> <p>In the more puritan times now open to us state intervention will have more legitimacy. I'm sure Cameron understands that; he's a smart man. He'll sanction plenty himself if he wins big in 2010, as his speech today confirms.</p> <p>But he's storing up trouble in today's speech by again talking about tax cuts (freezing council tax for instance) and shrinking the public sector, not least by tackling our old friend, waste.</p> <p>That's fine, but it's not going to be what the next few years are about. Ireland this week whacked up taxes to pay for the financial crisis now upon it and Ireland is arguably in better macroeconomic shape than we are. No wonder the Telegraph's urban guerilla columnists (no longer the urbane kind) get cross with Dave 'n' George for being so - Dave's word - \"responsible\".</p> <p>We'll see. Cameron's team has devised all sorts of mechanisms to guard against government wickedness (his own, presumably?) like the independent monitor of government spending and - a new one today? - a \"debt responsibility mechanism\" which will require the Bank of England to lean on the FSA if it's worried about lending, forcing it to raise capital requirement of errant banks.</p> <p>There's a passage in this morning's speech which we should all cut out and paste to our shaving mirrors - yes, even you ladies.</p> <blockquote> <p>That means discipline in opposition. No spending commitments which will never be delivered. No promises of upfront, unfunded tax cuts which will never happen. Instead, responsibly focusing on what can \u2013 and cannot \u2013 be done. And it means discipline in government. Saying \"no\" more than \"yes\". Not borrowing to try and buy yourself a byelection. Living within your means.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>We should judge shadow cabinet speeches by this yardstick as well as the cabinet's because the word didn't seem to have reached the Tory conference in Brum, which was awash with pledges, wholesome and otherwise.</p> <p>Yet for me the most interesting omission from Cameron's speech is any indication that we as individual citizens are in any way to blame for the crisis. Yes, the banks behaved badly, the government went along with things it should not have tolerated, the financial regulator dozed while teenage drivers tore off their City L-plates.</p> <p>But no one forced us to do daft things like take out 125% mortgages, use the old homestead as an ATM machine, flip buy-to-lets like the aforementioned burger or max six credit cards.

  "<p>The hundreds of visitors descending on the Baby Show at Earl's Court today are there to check out buggies, prams, babygros and maternity clothes. <br>But behind the scenes a row has broken out over the organisers' links to the defence industry, leading to the sponsors Bounty withdrawing their stand at the exhibition. </p> <p>Unicef has also stopped accepting donations from ticket sales because the exhibition's owner Clarion Events also runs controversial arms trade fairs. <br>Clarion, which will also be running the Spirit of Christmas show next month, picked up the DSEi, ITEC and LAAD defence shows from the publishing company Reed Elsevier earlier this year. </p> <p>Then in September it added the submarine exhibitions UDT Europe and UDT Asia Pacific to its portfolio. </p> <p>DSEi \u2013 Defence Systems and Equipment International \u2013 is an exhibition held every two years in London for the defence industry and last year attracted 26,500 visitors and 1,352 exhibitors from 40 countries. </p> <p>Clarion's brochure for the next show \u2013 to be held in September next year \u2013 boasts that the east London venue ExCeL allows \"warships to berth alongside the exhibition halls\". </p> <p>The Campaign Against the Arms Trade wrote to Baby Show exhibitors to inform them of Clarion's defence shows, prompting letters from Clarion reassuring them that their exhibitions served the \"legitimate global defence industry\". </p> <p>\"Congratulations to those companies and customers who have stood up and said that the owners of the Baby Show should not be running arms fairs,\" said a CAAT spokesman. \"Clarion is out of touch with public opinion. They can restore their reputation only by ending their involvement in the arms trade.\"<br> Clarion chief executive Simon Kimble said: \"Our ethics are important to us and we serve only the legitimate defence and security industry. Exhibitors and visitors must adhere to the highest regulatory scrutiny. We insist they not just comply with, but exceed, UK and international law.</p> <p>\"Defence and security is a legitimate business and like any other show we run we apply the same very high standards, rigour, experience and skill to organising events in this sector as we do in all of our others. </p> <p>\"Our defence and security exhibitions are just that, exhibitions, no weapons are for sale at the events and any business done would, in any case, be regulated by the toughest export regime in the world. We agree with the UN that the legitimate defence industry, regulated by a binding international treaty, is the best way to end the illegal trade in weapons.\"</p> <p>Bounty, the baby products company that has more than 3 million members in its parenting club, confirmed it was not intending to exhibit at the Baby Show. <br>But it remains a sponsor of the show, with its name featuring prominently at today's event and with a high-profile credit on the Baby Show website. </p> <p>\"We are not exhibiting at the Baby Show this weekend,\" a spokeswoman for Bounty said. </p> <p>Unicef was going to take donations from ticket sales to provide tetanus vaccines, as part of a scheme it runs with Pampers nappies, but decided to sever ties after it learned of the Baby Show's link to DSEi. </p> <p>\"We have taken the matter very seriously and can confirm that we will not be accepting any donations from Clarion Events,\" Unicef said in a statement. </p> <p>\"Clarion Events is not a corporate partner of Unicef UK and we have not received any money from them to date. We would like to make it clear that neither Pampers nor Unicef will be accepting any financial donation by Clarion Events. </p> <p>\"We would like to reassure the public who have already bought tickets to the Baby Show that their donation will be recognised by Pampers who have offered to make an additional donation to the vaccine campaign, covering the entire amount that was expected to be raised from ticket sales.\"</p>",
  "<p>The back cover of Gang Gang Dance's fourth album depicts a man in a white robe and obscuring headscarf, carrying - no, not a backpack filled with explosives, but an amp for an electric guitar. It's a cheeky, provocative image that neatly expresses the Brooklyn quartet's desire to subvert cliche and forge unexpected connections between people and sounds. What that means musically is an album poised between dance and rock, New York abstract electronica and African tribal rhythms, 1980s post-punk-ambient-experimentalism and 21st-century futurism. A mish-mash, then, but one arranged with exquisite precision. One moment the global percussion and electronic drums are melodious but scattershot, the next hypnotically repetitive. In Bebey, the keyboards open fire with space-invader weaponry, then in Vacuum they reel as though buffeted by a storm. Vocalist Lizzi Bougatsos veers from pagan shrieks to pop sentimentality in the blink of an eye. Just keeping up is an invigorating challenge.</p>",

  "<p>Gordon Brown today dubbed the credit crunch the \"defining moment for the world economy\" as he called for global solutions to tackle the financial crisis.</p> <p>In an article written for today's Washington Post, the prime minister said the problems experienced in the world's money markets over the last few weeks provided an opportunity to create new rules for the global economy. </p> <p>The old post-war international financial institutions were out of date and had to be rebuilt for a new era in which there is \"global, not national, competition and open, not closed, economies\". </p> <p>Brown wrote: \"International flows of capital are so big they can overwhelm individual governments. And trust, the most precious asset of all, has been eroded.\" </p> <p>He continued: \"Confidence about the future is vital to building confidence for today. We must deal with more than the symptoms of the current crisis. We have to tackle the root causes. So the next stage is to rebuild our fractured international financial system.\"</p> <p>Brown's comments follow a gathering of European leaders in Brussels this week that centered on drawing up the guiding principles of responsibility, integrity and global governance ahead of a wholesale modernisation of international financial institutions. </p> <p>Brown said: \"We agreed that urgent decisions implementing these principles should be made to root out the irresponsible and often undisclosed lending at the heart of our problems.\" </p> <p>The prime minister has been widely praised for his bail-out plan, which involved the recapitalisation of several British banks. </p> <p>But he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/17/davidcameron-politicalnews\">attacked today by the opposition leader, David Cameron</a>, who blamed the scale of the current credit crunch on \"irresponsible capitalism\" under eleven years of New Labour.</p>",
  "<p>Labour has nearly doubled its lead over the Tories on economic competence, according to the latest opinion poll, published on the day in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> accused <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> of presiding over a \"complete and utter failure\" of economic policy.</p> <p>Cameron used a hard-hitting speech to the City of London to shore up his economic credentials following another week in which Brown received widespread praise for his handling of the banking collapse both in Britain and abroad.</p> <p>But Cameron's attempt to steal the limelight today was undermined by the findings of a ComRes survey for BBC2's Daily Politics show that showed the Tories trailing by 11 points. </p> <p>Of the thousand people surveyed, 42% considered Brown and his chancellor, Alistair Darling, the politicians they \"trust most to steer Britain's economy through the current downturn\". </p> <p>While Labour went up two points, the Conservative leader and the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, dropped three points to 31%. </p> <p>Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, and his Treasury spokesman, Vincent Cable, were up two at 7%, while almost one in five (19%) said they did not know. </p> <p>Cameron today outlined his plans for economic responsibility to replace \"irresponsible capitalism and irresponsible government\" under Labour. </p> <p>He began his attack by accusing the prime minister of basing his financial decisions on \"false assumptions\" that he said had left the economy in ruins.</p> <p>Among them were the ideas that a successful economy could be built on a \"narrow base of housing, public spending and financial services\" and \"that you could abolish boom and bust, and that the good times would last forever\".</p> <p>The Conservative leader said it was up to his party to \"fix\" the economy that Labour had broken.</p> <p>He dismissed critics who believed that \"permanent state intervention\" was the only way to avoid a repeat of the problems.</p> <p>Those who believed the change the country needed was a \"turn to the left\" were wrong, he said, as he promised to inject greater responsibility into the economy through a centre-right platform of measures. </p> <p>Cameron said the Tories had only supported the recapitalisation of banks to minimise the economic downturn because the only thing worse than state aid for banks \"is doing nothing\".</p> <p>\"Some people think that this decision - to support recapitalisation - means that we somehow now subscribe to the government's entire economic policy and doctrine.</p> <p>\"Let me make it crystal clear: we do not. And the complete and utter failure of their economic record has never been more clear to see.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/16/AR2008101603179.html?hpid=opinionsbox1\">Brown said today in an article in the Washington Post</a> that the credit crunch would prove to be the \"defining moment for the world economy\", one which presented an opportunity to create new rules for the global economy.</p> <p>The problems experienced in the world's money markets over the last few weeks were the first financial crisis of the new global age, the prime minister wrote.</p> <p>Cameron said New Labour had allowed the boom to go on for too long because having previously opposed free-market economics, the party had decided to accept it without questioning or understanding how it really worked. </p> <p>He charted Brown's comments on the city over the past four years. \"Only last year, he was celebrating what he called a 'golden age for the City of London', now he's describing that very same time an 'age of irresponsibility' \u2026 Does Gordon Brown really think he's going to get away with that? He cannot hide his mistakes. He cannot hide from the truth.\"</p> <p>Cameron said the economy did not need more freedoms, but more responsibility. \"Just as this party under my leadership has stood for social responsibility, now it must stand also for economic responsibility.\"</p> <p>A Tory government would introduce discipline in government - \"saying no more than yes\" and living within its means. </p> <p>Cameron outlined measures to help repair the economy. These included no promises of upfront tax cuts that could not be delivered, tougher regulation of the banking sector and changes to the insolvency laws to protect sound but struggling businesses.</p> <p>The Tory leader also hit out at \"unsustainable\" immigration-fuelled growth and the demise of manufacturing jobs. </p> <p>\"We've got to broaden our economic base to include more science, more hi-tech services, more green technologies, more engineering and more high-value manufacturing, drawing upon a much wider range of industries, markets, people, towns and cities.\"</p> <p>He promised a new debt responsibility mechanism, with the Bank of England required to write regularly to the Financial Services Authority about sustainability of the level of debt in the economy.</p> <p>\"If the level of debt is growing unsustainably, the bank will instruct the FSA to ensure banks either slow their lending or put aside more capital.\"</p> <p>An independent office of budget responsibility would hold the government to account and monitor its decisions on tax and spending, and \"proper responsible regulation\" would govern the banking system. </p> <p>Cameron called for a cultural change in the banking sector and a review of the incentives driving the sector. \"No longer must they think just that because they are abiding by the rules, morality goes out the window,\" he said.</p> <p>Cameron has previously pledged to fix Britain's \"broken society\", the environment, and what he claims is a broken political system. </p> <p>Asked in a press conference which repair job he would focus on first, he said: \"The truth is that the economy is going to be the most important issue for any government to get to grips with. We need change in order to mend the broken economy and this government cannot do it because they are not prepared to accept any mistakes over what has happened.\"</p> <p>He said taxes could not come down as long as the high costs of broken society continued. This made fixing the economy and society inextricably linked.</p> <p>Yvette Cooper, the chief secretary to the Treasury, branded Cameron's speech another \"short-term gimmick\" by the Tories.</p> <p>\"At a time when the British people want calm leadership and serious policies to get through tougher times, David Cameron is engaged in playing juvenile political games,\" she said.</p> <p>Clegg accused Cameron of a return to the \"Punch and Judy\" politics he once claimed to have rejected. </p> <p>\"I think it's the worst kind of politics,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. </p> <p>\"Two weeks ago David Cameron said he was a man with a plan, and yet he takes this opportunity of a speech to say nothing of any real material substance on what is the biggest economic crisis facing this country for decades. </p> <p>\"What I find so disappointing about David Cameron's speech is that it's all yah-boo, Punch and Judy, throwing around insults.\"</p> <p>Asked about Cameron's comments, Brown said: \"My undivided attention is on taking this country through the difficult times as a result of a global problem that started in America. I think the whole country wants everybody who can to work together through these difficult challenges. </p> <p>\"We are rebuilding the banking system. We are working to ensure that people with small businesses are helped and we are trying to make sure that we restart the housing market. I am determined that we as a nation come through these difficult times and to make sure that we can.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>October 16 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Climate change</strong><br> The energy and climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, committed the UK to slashing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by the middle of the century in a bid to tackle climate change. </p> <p>He said the current 60% target would be replaced by the higher goal in the climate change bill. He added that the tough economic conditions were not an excuse to \"row back\" on the commitment to tackle global warming. </p> <p>Miliband warned energy companies to act \"in a satisfactory way\" to reduce charges for customers with pre-payment meters and those not connected to the gas main. He said the government expected \"rapid action or explanation to remedy any abuses\" and warned if the firms do not act then ministers would consult on legislation to prevent \"unfair pricing\". </p> <p>Greg Clark, the shadow climate change secretary, welcomed the announcements. He said: \"The choice between aggressive and ambitious action on carbon reduction and a successful, powerful economy is, in fact, not a choice at all - they are one and the same.\" </p> <p><strong>Jobs</strong></p> <p>The university and skills secretary, John Denham, promised further assistance for those who lose jobs due to the downturn. </p> <p>\"Learn Direct is and will be able to offer one-to-one advice on careers, skills and retraining - and I'll be taking further measures to promote this service. Second, I'll be working with further education colleges to ensure they are making every effort to offer appropriate advice and support on skills training to those who may worry about losing their jobs.\" </p> <p><strong>Iceland</strong></p> <p>Tory spokesman Rob Wilson warned failure of the Icelandic banks posed a \"potentially serious blow\" to universities with millions of pounds locked up in their accounts. </p> <p>The universities minister, David Lammy, said it was a \"serious\" issue but had to be put in context. </p> <p>\"Frontline services and services to students, as we are advised by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, are not affected. We understand there are 12 universities that have placed money on deposit with Icelandic banks. </p> <p>\"The total involved is \u00a377m and there is a process of discussion between the Treasury and Iceland on these matters.\" </p> <p><strong>Universities</strong></p> <p>University applications are \"dramatically\" down by 30% compared with the same time last year, David Willetts, the shadow universities secretary, warned. </p> <p>Using leaked figures, he told the Commons this was a \"potentially alarming\" development. </p> <p>But Denham said it was still very early in the application process and there was no reason to suggest numbers would not pick up. </p> <p><strong>42-day detention</strong></p> <p>The decision of the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, to make a late-night statement on plans to drop the extension of pre-charge detention for terror suspects to 42 days was criticised by the shadow leader of the Commons, Theresa May. </p> <p>May accused the government of choosing to make the statement then because there were \"fewer members in the chamber\" to ask questions. </p> <p>Harriet Harman, the leader of the house, said it had been important to deliver the statement as soon as possible, otherwise \"speculation could have run overnight\". </p> <p><strong>Abortion</strong></p> <p>Harman denied reports of a rift between herself and the prime minister over a bid by MPs to change abortion laws. </p> <p>She told MPs there was \"no truth\" in a newspaper article that she had clashed with Gordon Brown over the amount of time to be allowed to debate the human fertilisation and embryology bill next week. </p> <p>She would \"do her best\" to allow as much time as possible. </p> <p><strong>Equitable Life</strong></p> <p>The chancellor is set to respond to the parliamentary ombudsman's call for compensation to Equitable Life policyholders within weeks, Harman suggested. </p> <p>She reiterated the chancellor's latest response that he would speak to the house about the company \"in the autumn\". </p> <p>Heckled by Tories, she added: \"Indeed, you are absolutely right, it is the autumn. Autumn hasn't finished yet.\" </p> <p><strong>Mandelson</strong></p> <p>The business secretary, Lord Mandelson, in his maiden Lords speech, told peers: \"It's nice to be back.\" </p> <p>He described speaking in the house for the first time as \"a great honour\". Mandelson introduced an order to allow the merger of HBOS and Lloyds TSB. </p> <p><strong>Football</strong></p> <p>Norman Lamb (Lib Dem, Norfolk North) urged the government to look into \"very serious allegations\" of match-fixing in a Championship football match. </p> <p>He said \"very unusual betting patterns\" had taken place on a game between Norwich City and Derby on October 4. </p> <p>Harman told Lamb she would ask the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, to write to him. </p> <p><strong>Shares</strong></p> <p>The short selling of shares is \"a wart on the face of capitalism\", pension fund manager Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, warned. </p> <p>He said it was \"very dangerous\" and \"effectively a bet against the taxpayer\" and added that \"hedge-fund hyenas\" should not be allowed to do it. </p> <p>Lord Davies of Oldham, for the government, said: \"In the extreme turbulence in the markets short selling played its part in aggravating the problem. But in more normal times short selling is an indicator of the value of a company and it therefore plays its parts in the general evaluation of company operations.\" </p> <p><strong>Alcohol</strong></p> <p>A key plank of government plans to tackle alcohol-fuelled disorder has still not been used after two years, it emerged. </p> <p>Drinking banning orders were designed to bar repeat offenders from specific areas and bars. </p> <p>But Alan Campbell, the Home Office minister, acknowledged none had been made since the Violent Crime Reduction Act became law in 2006. </p> <p>Implementation had been \"delayed in the light of recent developments\". </p> <p><strong>Lifeboats</strong></p> <p>The Royal National Lifeboat Institution should not be seen as a \"cash cow\" to be hit by proposed \"massive increases\" for radio licences, Alistair Carmichael (Lib Dem, Orkney and Shetland) protested. </p> <p>Harman told him: \"I join you in paying tribute to the RNLI and I will raise the point you make with the relevant ministers.\" </p> <p><strong>Stephen Carter</strong></p> <p>Technology, communications and broadcasting minister Stephen Carter took his Lords seat as Lord Carter of Barnes.</p>",

  "<p>With the potential repercussions of the global financial crisis still hard to imagine, Middle East commentators have begun to wonder how the economic turmoil will affect the region and particularly the chances to achieve success in the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, or Israel and Syria. Unsurprisingly, the outlook seems gloomy: it isn't just that the money needed to bolster any peace agreement will probably be much more difficult to raise, but there is also the concern that politicians preoccupied with urgent economic problems will have little time and energy left to focus on the pursuit of peace. </p> <p>Against this backdrop, the idealistic view that peace is priceless is already beginning to look like a luxury, because realistically, peace won't come cheap. As Herb Keinon <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com /servlet/Satellite?cid=\" 1222017521893&amp;pagename=\"JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&quot;&quot;\">put it bluntly</a> in the Jerusalem Post: </p> <blockquote> <p>The disappearance of trillions of dollars worldwide will \u2026 make it difficult for the international community to pay for an Israeli-Palestinian, or Israeli-Syrian, agreement, even if they miraculously appear. Who would pay for the tens of billions of dollars worth of new early-warning systems Israel would have to set up following deep withdrawals from the West Bank and Jordan Valley, or a complete withdrawal \u2026 from the Golan Heights? Who would pay compensation to Palestinian refugees if an agreement were reached that would deny them a \"right of return\" to pre-1967 Israel, but would recognise their right to compensation? Who would pay for the Palestinian security services or fund the infrastructure if a Palestinian state were agreed upon? </p> </blockquote> <p>But while there is <a href=\"http://www.washtimes.com/news/2008/oct/13/financial-crisis-seen-dooming-mideast-accord/\">widespread pessimism</a> about the impact of the current financial crisis on the Middle East peace process, the tendency to focus now on the costs of peace could all too easily result in a miscalculation, because the status quo also comes with a price tag attached. Earlier this month, Israeli prime minister-designate Tzipi Livni argued in her first <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/10/05/news/ML-Israel-Palestinians.php\">foreign policy speech</a> since her appointment to form a new government that Israel must press ahead with peace talks because \"doing nothing has its own price\". The \"price\" Livni had in mind was primarily a political one, namely a strengthening of extremist forces in the region; yet, such a development could obviously also entail a very real price tag in terms of defense spending. </p> <p>As expensive as peace may seem in the current economic crisis, it is hard to believe that giving up on the peace process now could turn out to be somehow more \"affordable\". While the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations initiated almost a year ago in Annapolis have not yet produced any tangible results and expectations for a breakthrough by the end of this year are very low, there have been some positive developments away from the limelight. Some of these developments were <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2008/10/110954.htm\">highlighted</a> by secretary of state Condoleezza Rice at the Palestinian Business and Investment Forum in Washington on Tuesday. The meeting was organised by the US-Palestinian Partnership, which was <a href=\"http://www.uspalestinianpartnership.org/site/c.kjJQJ7MSIuE/b.4113019/k.AFFB/About.htm\">established</a> in the wake of last year's Annapolis meeting to stimulate investment and promote economic development in the West Bank. It is easy to belittle such initiatives as a mere palliative, since the large-scale economic development needed in the Palestinian territories will continue to depend on the progress made in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations; at the same time, it is clear that risking the momentum that has been created would be costly in more than one sense.</p> <p>Unfortunately, given the current economic turmoil, concerns that the peace process may falter due to a lack of funding and a lack of the necessary sense of urgency and engagement seem all too justified. But perhaps this is also a good moment to draw attention to the plans of a billionaire who has decided to dedicate himself to \"the business of peace\". According to a <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1014151.html\">Ha'aretz report</a> from August, Daniel Abraham has \"a practical, financial proposal for solving the Palestinian refugee problem \u2013 an offer even Benjamin Netanyahu would have trouble refusing\". Abraham's plan is apparently still a tightly-guarded secret, and one can only hope that it has not been rendered impractical by the recent developments in the global financial markets. But in any case, even a pricey peace must seem like a real bargain compared to the almost unlimited resources that are so often required to wage war.</p>",
  "<p>In a lighter moment, David Cameron could be caricatured as a rather well-paid odd-job man. He's planning to fix the broken society, the broken politics, and now the broken economy. His speech earlier today at Bloomberg was all about spelling out that centre-right policies are the right tool for the job. <br><br>The reason Gordon Brown has botched the job of running the economy, both as chancellor for 10 years and now as prime minister, said Cameron, is that the centre-left doesn't really understand how the free market works. So New Labour went over the top and now here we are, with an economic slump on our hands. The global economic backdrop that brought countries' economies almost to their knees only got a cursory mention.</p> <p>As Brown notches up some acclaim for devising a blueprint rescue package for banks that looks set to be emulated in other countries, Cameron's speech was designed to paint the prime minister as Bodge It Brown. </p> <p>With this one big speech the Tory leader declared the party's short-lived truce with the government, when it was all hands to the pump, officially over and we are back to business as usual: Cameron branding Brown an economic cowboy.</p>",
  "<p>Joe the Plumber enjoyed a brief but blazing turn in the media spotlight yesterday, the day after John McCain used the Toledo, Ohio worker as a foil for criticism of Barack Obama's tax policy at a debate. At campaign events yesterday, McCain and running mate Sarah Palin both invoked Joe Wurzelbacher in efforts to portray McCain as a champion of the middle class. Palin said in Maine that McCain is \"a leader who is going to Washington to work for Joe the plumber,\" while McCain declared in Pennsylvania that \"Joe's the man\" and was the \"real winner\" of the debate the previous night. But Joe himself is no average plumber - and according to some in the trade has not earned the title. Wurzelbacher is not a member of the local plumbers union, writes Ed Pilkington in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-johnmccain\">today's Guardian</a>, has no licence to practice the trade, and owes the government more than $1,000 in back taxes. Wurzelbacher says he does not need a licence because he works for someone else on residential property.</p> <p>Meanwhile, after being deemed the victor in Thursday's debates, Obama began moving aggressively into several more states long in Republican hands, Suzanne Goldenberg and Ewen MacAskill write in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-barackobama\">today's Guardian</a>. The campaign is taking advantage of its flush coffers and running advertisements in West Virginia, Kentucky and Georgia. Obama and running mate Joe Biden may campaign in Montana and South Dakota - once considered out of reach. Obama today warned his supporters not to get too cocky, reminding them he lost the January New Hampshire primary to Hillary Clinton despite late polls predicting a win.</p> <p>At the Alfred E Smith charity dinner in New York, white tie-clad Obama and McCain mocked each other before a crowd of media and political luminaries, including the mayor and governor of New York and senators Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer. McCain joked that he had sacked his entire campaign staff and hired \"Joe the Plumber\" to replace them. Obama poked fun at his decision to move his Democratic convention speech to a football stadium. \"I was originally told we'd be able to move this outdoors to Yankee Stadium,\" he said of the dinner. Pausing and surveying the room, he said, \"Could somebody tell me what happened to the Greek columns that I requested?\"</p> <p>Also last night, McCain underwent a gruelling make-up appearance on David Letterman's television show, after cancelling a visit to the New York studio when the banking crisis broke out last month. Letterman, who had been visibly irritated by McCain's last-minute change of plans, pressed McCain on his attacks on Obama's association with Vietnam war-era radical William Ayers. \"Are they double-dating, are they going to dinner, what are they doing?\" Letterman asked. \"Are they driving across country?\" \"Maybe going to Denny's,\" an exasperated McCain replied, before jokingly threatening to raise Letterman's taxes if elected.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>McCain is in Florida today, while Palin holds rallies in Ohio and Indiana. McCain's daughter Meghan travels to three towns in Maine, holding a pizza lunch with supporters and a meeting at a pub. Obama is in Virginia. Hillary Clinton hits the trail for Obama in Youngstown, Ohio, hoping to rouse middle-class whites. Listen to see if McCain and Palin keep at Joe the Plumber, or if they abandon him after the revelations about his professional status and tax arrears.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Gallup's daily tracking poll showed Obama's lead has narrowed to 6 points, 49% to 43% for McCain, from 50% to 43% the day before. That result does not account for Wednesday night's debate. A poll in Pennsylvania by Muhlenberg College showed Obama ahead in the key swing state by 16 points, 53% to 37%. That poll also found that only 35% of Pennsylvania voters have a favourable opinion of McCain, compared to 53% for Obama. In Ohio, a Rasmussen poll shows the two candidates tied 49% to 49%.</p> <h2>Quotes of the day</h2> <p>John McCain at the Alfred E Smith dinner in New York City: \"Even in this room full of proud Manhattan Democrats, I can't shake the feeling that some people here are pulling for me. I'm delighted to see you here tonight, Hillary.\"<br>\"Don't boo now, just vote,\" Obama advised supporters in New Hampshire, after they reacted to his declaration that McCain wanted to \"turn the page\" on discussion of the economy.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-barackobama1\">Foreign poll favours Democrat but shows hostility to US</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/uselections2008-johnmccain1\">Community organisers stump McCain</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-johnmccain4\">Campaign diary: Joe the Plumber roundup</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/john-mccain-virginia-roanoke-campaign\">Five reasons why McCain's campaign is floundering</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/cartoon/2008/oct/17/obama-mccain-elections-debate\">Cartoon: Steve Bell on the Obama-McCain debate</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/16/AR2008101603436.html?hpid=opinionsbox1\">Washington Post: Barack Obama for President</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/mccain-and-obama-palling-around-must-be-the-al-smith-dinner/?hp\">NY Times: McCain and Obama Palling Around?

  "<p>I've travelled across much of sub-Saharan Africa for the purpose of meeting families and communities, described as living in \"absolute poverty\". Each time I expect to be confronted with images of despair and hopelessness I could not be more wrong. Children giggle uncontrollably at \"the westerner\" trying to say hello in their local dialect, and women living with HIV radiate hope and faith for a better tomorrow.<br> Herein lies an unlikely, but obvious coupling - faith and international development. Beyond the visible infrastructure of schools and hospitals the efforts at the local grassroots level often remain overlooked and forgotten. Yet it is here that church networks extend into the darkest city slum and the most remote rural areas, beyond the reach of even the most robust NGO 4x4.</p> <p>It's here \u2013 at the epicentre of food security, famine or flood disasters, at the heart of the Aids pandemic \u2013 that the church is having the greatest impact. It is here that the church offers the greatest potential in helping to scale up wider efforts for poverty reduction.<br> The church is one of the few movements that is both local and global. It draws from an impressive portfolio of highly professional church-based organisations and denominational structures robust enough to fill the gap when states fail in their duty to provide vital services for the marginalised and poorest in society. As an international network it also has the ability to mobilise hundreds of thousands of people worldwide to lobby policy makers to take up their responsibilities to eliminate poverty and provide those basic rights and services for all.</p> <p>For more than 20 years, <strong><a href=\"http://www.tearfund.org/\">Tearfund</a></strong> partner Kigezi diocese has been delivering water and sanitation to households in remote mountainous parts of south-west Uganda, several hundred metres above ground and surface water supplies. Since 2006, 23 voluntary women's groups have been trained in masonry and have now installed 4,000-litre rainwater catchment tanks for the benefit of the poorest households. Kigezi diocese is now influential in national policymaking on water.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Africa, the Churches Health Association of Zambia, a network of church-owned hospitals and health centres, provides nearly a third of Zambia's healthcare, and half of its rural healthcare provision. Ethiopia's Kale Heywet Church \u2013 which fields 6,000 congregations and more than 5 million individual members - is the largest local provider of antiretroviral drugs for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. A network of 1,000 local church leaders in Rwanda are now rolling out a three-year programme to train 2.5 million Rwandans on how to combat malaria and rebuild peace through reconciliation.<br> And, in the thick of Zimbabwe's political crisis, church leaders have played a key role in disseminating information about what is happening throughout the remote rural communities, and have been some of the loudest voices speaking out against injustice. In addition, the practical day to day relief comes when pastors with their sleeves rolled up are providing water from huge tanks in church compounds, or running food distribution centres.  Is the church perfect? Of course not. The church has sometimes been on the wrong side; harmful attitudes have contributed towards the stigmatisation of people living with HIV, and the failure to speak out against political oppression. Here the church also needs to be challenged and transformed. However, overall, it is impossible to deny the church's vital role in the global movement to eradicate poverty.  As we pass the halfway point to achieving the Millennium Development Goals to halve poverty by 2015, goal 8, which calls for a \"global partnership\", becomes more important than ever. International development forums all agree, we must put the poor at the heart of our global economy, and make aid work harder so it has a greater impact on the poorest communities. A collaborative effort is required. Government institutions, business and civil society groups all have critical roles to play. In this global endeavour the central role of the Christian church and other faith communities must not be overlooked. The church is a critical partner in poverty reduction. It is a major provider of services and social infrastructure in much of the developing world. It has the potential to be a powerful civil society voice holding governments to account. Somebody once said if you want to know where the poor are, ask where the church is. This could not be truer.  \u0095 Matthew Frost is the chief executive of Christian relief and development agency Tearfund.</p>",

  "<p>Politics is about many things \u2013 the words you speak, the understanding you have of the problems we face, the vision you have, the policies you draw up and your ability to implement them.</p> <p>But all of those rest on the shoulders of one thing \u2013 the decisions and judgement calls you make.</p> <p>One important judgement call for us as an Opposition Party was whether to support the re-capitalisation of our banks with billions of pounds of taxpayers' money.</p> <p>We did support that \u2013 and my Party backed the decision, united and strong.</p> <p>Of course the details of the deal should be discussed robustly.</p> <p>This includes looking at the Government's confusion over returning to 2007 lending levels and the debate over dividends.</p> <p>But some people think that this decision - to support recapitalisation - means that we somehow now subscribe to the Government's entire economic policy and doctrine.</p> <p>Let me make it crystal clear \u2013 we do not.</p> <p>And the complete and utter failure of their economic record has never been more clear to see.</p> <p>This crisis has highlighted just how mistaken Labour's economic policy has been.</p> <p>The economic assumptions that Gordon Brown made in the last decade now lie in ruins.</p> <p>His assumption that a government could preserve stability while running a budget deficit in a boom.</p> <p>His assumption that global financial integration reduced, rather than increased, the risks in our domestic economy.</p> <p>His assumption that you could build a sustainable economy on a narrow base of housing, public spending, and financial services.</p> <p>His assumption that we could permanently spend more than our income and build an economy on debt.</p> <p>His assumption that you could abolish boom and bust and that the good times would last forever.</p> <p>Now we can see that each of his assumptions were false.</p> <p>Any proper consideration of what the policies of the last decade have produced leads us to three simple words.</p> <p>We need change. </p> <p>What's happened over the last ten years is that Labour has broken our economy \u2013 and we must fix it.</p> <p>Some have argued that the lesson of this crisis \u2013 and indeed of these years - is that the free enterprise economy is now deprived of legitimacy, and that only increased, permanent state intervention can save us from a repetition of the problems we face.</p> <p>These critics also assert that the centre-right has no solution and the change we need is a turn to the left.</p> <p>They are wrong.</p> <p>My argument today is that the change we need is the modern Conservatism that I have been advocating.</p> <p>In Birmingham a few weeks ago I explained that the central political idea underlying my Conservatism is the idea of responsibility.</p> <p>Not freedom, which some may wrongly assume is the animating force of Conservatism \u2013 but responsibility.</p> <p>The problem with freedom is that it can too easily tip over into licence \u2013 the idea that people can do whatever they please regardless of the consequences for others.</p> <p>And that is exactly what has happened to our economy.</p> <p>Over the past decade, we have seen a total breakdown of economic responsibility.</p> <p>From the government, as it has spent and borrowed without restraint.</p> <p>And from our financial sector, which has taken decisions which have harmed the rest of our economy. </p> <p>So it is not more freedom that our economy needs; it is more responsibility.</p> <p>Just as this Party under my leadership has stood for social responsibility, now it must stand also for economic responsibility.</p> <p>We've had irresponsible capitalism presided over by irresponsible government.</p> <p>Instead, what we need is responsible free enterprise, regulated and supported by responsible government.</p> <p>Today, I want to set out how we got to where we are \u2013 financial crisis and economic downturn.</p> <p>I will show how a responsible government should act to mitigate the immediate effects of the crisis.</p> <p>Because though Gordon Brown is trying to rescue the banks, we now need a plan to rescue the economy.</p> <p>And I will show what we need to do to establish the centre-right alternative, which consists of fiscal responsibility, financial responsibility and a balanced economy.</p> <p>The crisis that we face has deep roots.</p> <p>We all know the simplistic version.</p> <p>People in America were given sub-prime mortgages they couldn't afford.</p> <p>The banks devised new ways of chopping up debt and selling it on.</p> <p>No one understood the assets they were buying.</p> <p>So when the merry-go-around stopped, it all came tumbling down.</p> <p>That's all true.</p> <p>But it's only half the truth.</p> <p>It's only by understanding the deeper causes of this crisis that can we hope to find the long-term cures.</p> <p>The underlying dynamic was this global boom presented those in charge of economic management in Britain with a temptation\u2026</p> <p>\u2026and they succumbed to it.</p> <p>And the result was a combination of irresponsible capitalism and irresponsible government that has brought us to instability and our present crisis.</p> <p>Over the past two decades, two billion people - a third of the world's population - left subsistence agriculture and joined the global economy. </p> <p>The result was cheaper goods for all of us in the west, and an enormous increase in wealth among those who began to trade. </p> <p>It's why some economists call the Consumer Price Index - or CPI - the \"China Price Index\".</p> <p>The new middle classes in the east, and their governments, saved a huge proportion of their new wealth. </p> <p>For example in China, for a time, the average family saved over half its income. </p> <p>These savings were invested in the West, giving us and our governments the licence to borrow from overseas like never before. </p> <p>In Britain we took advantage of this new debt without stopping to think of the consequences. </p> <p>In other words, the emerging economies offered us a cheap loan, and we borrowed and spent like there was no tomorrow. </p> <p>Low inflation meant that interest rates could stay low and the financial system found new ways of channelling this flood of money into asset prices and debt.</p> <p>Government made things worse.</p> <p>The Chancellor who prided himself on prudence came to believe that he uniquely in the history of economics had ended the trade cycle and abolished boom and bust.</p> <p>So he thought the good days would never end, and borrowed and borrowed and borrowed, and racked up the biggest government deficit in the developed world. </p> <p>And he stood aside as our households racked up over a trillion pounds of personal debt. </p> <p>So when the boom did turn to bust and the value of assets fell our financial system was hit harder than most.</p> <p>The Government couldn't complain about financial institutions lending too much money because the Government itself was borrowing too much from them.</p> <p>Added to this was a regulatory mistake that I believe history will judge as one of the most irresponsible.</p> <p>Rather than trying to restrain lending, in 1997 the Government removed the Bank of England's historic ability to ensure that banking credit was kept within responsible limits.</p> <p>The one organisation with the experience, and authority, to call time on debt was taken out of the picture.</p> <p>It is now clear that the resulting, irresponsible borrowing by both private and public sectors was unsustainable.</p> <p>As the head of the Financial Service Authority, Lord Turner, has said, they \"allowed a boom to go on for too long\".</p> <p>So why did our Government let this happen?</p> <p>Was it negligence \u2013 or was it intentional?</p> <p>There is a strong case for saying it was intentional.</p> <p>New Labour took a new approach to economic and social policy.</p> <p>Having previously opposed free market economics, they decided to accept it without question, seeing it as a 'black box' to produce ever-growing tax revenues\u2026</p> <p>\u2026without properly understanding how it worked.</p> <p>The intention was to ride the wave of debt-fuelled growth to fund top-down government programmes in an attempt to \"guarantee fairness\".</p> <p>Of course, these mistakes were not only made in Britain.</p> <p>In other countries, too, excessive debt and irresponsible capitalism have led to serious crises, with implications for the whole world's financial system.</p> <p>The problems are now global and \u2013 as I argued back in March when I discussed the need for changes in the Basel Accords \u2013 some of the solutions will indeed need to be global.</p> <p>We all agree about that. </p> <p>But we mustn't let that consensus hide the truth.</p> <p>The underlying failures of policy were national.</p> <p>The failure to regulate U.S. sub-prime mortgages was an American failure.</p> <p>And the failure to regulate public and private debt in Britain was a British failure.</p> <p>It was a failure Gordon Brown was warned about time and again. </p> <p>And time and again he ignored those warnings. </p> <p>Four years ago he was telling the city: \"I want us to do even more to encourage the risk takers\".</p> <p>Two years ago, he was dismissing calls for what he called a \"regulatory crackdown\" on the City. </p> <p>And only last year, he was celebrating what he called a \"golden age for the City of London\"\u2026.</p> <p>\u2026Now he's describing that very same time an \"Age of Irresponsibility\". </p> <p>\"A Golden Age\" to an \"Age of Irresponsibility\" \u2013 in less than a year. That's what I call a Rock of Stability.</p> <p>Does Gordon Brown really think he's going to get away with that?</p> <p>He cannot hide from his mistakes. </p> <p>He cannot hide from the truth.</p> <p>The truth that over the past ten years, Britain has built up more personal debt than any other major economy in history. </p> <p>The truth that house prices rose higher in the UK than even in the US. </p> <p>The truth that the boom has now turned to bust. </p> <p>And perhaps most damning of all, the truth that while all economies have been hit by this financial crisis, Britain's banking bail-out has had to be the biggest in the world. </p> <p>So let me set out exactly where we've come to. </p> <p>Gordon Brown's policies \u2013 his entire economic strategy - has fundamentally failed. </p> <p>The first result of this failure in domestic policy in the UK was a debt-induced asset bubble in the private sector that has now burst, generating both downturn and serious threats to the stability of our financial system.</p> <p>The second result of this failure in UK policy is that our Government \u2013 having spent all the money in the good years - is less able to help people in this country get through this downturn than the government of almost any other developed country.</p> <p>The Government's deficit is so big that the cupboard is now bare.</p> <p>The third result of this failure of UK policy is that excessive debt-fuelled fiscal expansion, allied to rising raw material prices, has driven the Bank of England to keep interest rates higher \u2013 for longer - than they would otherwise be in order to control inflation.</p> <p>That's put further pressure on families, businesses and our financial institutions.</p> <p>And let's be clear what all this all now means in the real economy.</p> <p>We've got more and more families unable to make the mortgage repayments and losing their homes.</p> <p>We've got more and more good businesses going to the wall because they can't get the credit.</p> <p>And we've got more and more people losing their jobs through no fault of their own.</p> <p>And to this Government and to these Ministers who say that anyone mentioning these things is somehow \"talking Britain down\", everyone knows what you're trying to do \u2013 to close down debate, to shut people's eye, to hide the truth\u2026</p> <p>\u2026to mask your failures.</p> <p>I will never pull my punches in explaining how this Government has brought Britain down.</p> <p>The immediate consequence of all this is, of course, a combination of financial crisis and economic downturn.</p> <p>Before I address the question of how to prevent this from happening again, I want to talk about how we deal with the immediate crisis \u2013 to reduce, so far as possible, the pain suffered by families and businesses over the coming months.</p> <p>And I want to take head-on an idea that has been suggested in some quarters \u2013 the idea that the centre-right's whole economic philosophy is somehow undermined by our support for state action at this juncture.</p> <p>We did support the action taken to re-capitalise banks.</p> <p>Given the irresponsible levels of debt in our economy, it was the only way to minimise the downturn in the real economy \u2013 a downturn costly not only to families and businesses but also to the fiscal accounts.</p> <p>And as I've said two weeks ago, \"there is only one thing worse than state aid for banks, and that is doing nothing\".</p> <p>It was an action that had to be supported by any responsible, centre-right Party.</p> <p>But stabilising the financial system is not by any means enough.</p> <p>In the coming downturn, with unemployment already sharply rising, with real pain for many small businesses, many home-owners, many pensioners and many others besides \u2013 we cannot stand idly by.</p> <p>Some of the strain is being taken by monetary policy \u2013 as the Bank of England responds to circumstances in its decisions on interest rates.</p> <p>Another part of the strain will automatically be taken by the cyclical elements of the fiscal policy.</p> <p>In a downturn, tax revenues will decrease and spending on benefits will increase \u2013 the so-called 'automatic stabilisers'.</p> <p>This will help to counter deflationary pressures.</p> <p>And in the process, it will, of course, add to even further public sector borrowing \u2013 that is the inevitable consequence of economic downturn.</p> <p>But it only re-enforces the point that we have consistently made that it was irresponsible for the Government to borrow so much when the economy was booming.</p> <p>And to those who say we have not been consistent on this, I say go and read our 2005 election manifesto, which we fought on a commitment to cut waste principally to bring down government borrowing.</p> <p>In some countries, like Australia and Sweden, people and businesses can also be helped through significant tax-cuts that are affordable because governments did save for a rainy day.</p> <p>John Howard's responsible fiscal policies now put people in Australia in a very different position from us.</p> <p>But, even if upfront net tax cuts are much more difficult for us than for Australia, we can at least seek to minimise pain on families by preventing those taxes that most affect them from going up.</p> <p>That's why we'll freeze council tax for two years by reducing wasteful spending on advertising and consultancy in central government.</p> <p>There are, however, further, pro-active steps that government itself needs to take \u2013 and which any responsible party of the centre-right can and should support.</p> <p>These are actions to change the law in order to prevent vicious circles of insolvency making the downturn worse than it need otherwise be.</p> <p>That is why we have already proposed to reform insolvency law, to give sound companies breathing space when they face credit problems. </p> <p>And we should immediately suspend the annuities rule, which forces people to buy an annuity at retirement or at age 75. </p> <p>The current volatile markets mean that many pensioners are forced by this rule to lock in lower incomes for the rest of their lives.<br> Over the coming weeks and months we will set out many more ways to help families through the downturn.</p> <p>But short term action to get through the crisis is not enough. </p> <p>We need a long-term plan to rebuild our economy.<br> In a single phrase, we need to change from irresponsible capitalism and irresponsible Government, to responsible free enterprise and responsible Government. Just as I have made the case for social responsibility in our social reforms, our long term plan is based on the principle of economic responsibility. The principles that underpin our social reforms and our economic reforms are the same. That's hardly surprising. </p> <p>After all, to understand how an economy functions, you need to understand far more than the exchange rate and the money supply.<br> The centre right understands that society and the economy are both made up of the same thing: people. You need to get the incentives right, get the framework right, and give people responsibility to do the right thing.</p> <p>You also need people to know that they will be punished if they do the wrong thing.</p> <p>Just as we've argued in welfare, that if you don't accept a good offer of a job you should be denied your benefits\u2026</p> <p>\u2026so too should we say to bankers if you don't succeed, you shouldn't get your bonus.</p> <p>As George Osborne said in his conference speech in Birmingham, it's about demanding responsibility from all of your society \u2013 no matter what your wealth or income. </p> <p>We set out our plan for economic responsibility at conference.<br> It has three central elements. Fiscal responsibility - the Government must live within its means. Financial responsibility - you cannot build an economy on debt. And a balanced economy - as you cannot rely on unsustainable growth in a few areas to increase prosperity for everyone. The free enterprise economy, which has lifted billions out of poverty, is the fairest, strongest and most effective wealth-creator the world has ever known and we would be so much the worse off if we abandoned it. </p> <p>We shouldn't replace the free-market \u2013 we've got to repair it.</p> <p>Repairing our public finances.</p> <p>Repairing our financial services.</p> <p>Repairing our skills, infrastructure, and enterprise culture \u2013 to create a balanced economy.</p> <p>So let me set out exactly what we will do.</p> <p>First, we need to get our public finances back in order \u2013 the traditional role of the centre-right.</p> <p>This means having the character and judgement to impose discipline.</p> <p>That means discipline in opposition.</p> <p>No spending commitments which will never be delivered.</p> <p>No promises of upfront, unfunded tax cuts which will never happen.</p> <p>Instead, responsibly focusing on what can \u2013 and cannot \u2013 be done.</p> <p>And it means discipline in government.</p> <p>Saying 'no' more than 'yes'.</p> <p>Not borrowing to try and buy yourself a by-election.</p> <p>Living within your means.</p> <p>Cutting the costs of social failure, reforming public services and clamping down on public waste.</p> <p>Spending responsibly, borrowing responsibly and saving responsibly\u2026</p> <p>\u2026so in the long-term we can cut taxes responsibly.</p> <p>But to help governments stick to the right course, we need radical a plan for fiscal policy.</p> <p>So we'll have an independent Office of Budget Responsibility \u2013 which will hold every government to account.</p> <p>And to those who say this is just a duplication of what's already there, or just an admission of politicians' inability to take tough decisions, I say: \"wrong on all counts\".</p> <p>It will have far more authority than a select committee or a Westminster think-tank.</p> <p>But, it will not be a substitute for making tough decisions on tax and spending. </p> <p>We will not, as some have wrongly assumed, be subcontracting this core function of government.</p> <p>Quite the reverse: it is because we are so serious about taking those tough decisions on tax and spending that we want to be monitored by an independent authority.</p> <p>They report.</p> <p>Government's decide.</p> <p>So there will be no more fiddling the figures, dodgy statistics, political motivations and machinations to mess around with taxpayers' money \u2013 just good, honest, responsible government.</p> <p>Second, we need strong, responsible and proper regulation of the financial systems that underpin our economy \u2013 another traditional role of the centre-right.</p> <p>I believe in markets that work \u2013 not in the assumption that laissez-faire is enough.</p> <p>As I argued back in March, \"the modern, globalised economy, created to a large extent by laissez-faire economics, demands more than laissez-faire economics for success in the future\u2026.Even a free-marketeer understands that economic liberalism alone is not enough.\"</p> <p>Free markets need rules and frameworks, to make sure they work in the public interest.</p> <p>We regulate utility companies \u2013 and there is a good reason.</p> <p>If they fail, our lights go out \u2013 so we've got to make sure they work.</p> <p>And it's why we need proper, responsible regulation of our banking industry too.</p> <p>Because of the central role that retail banks and building societies play in our economy, they are just like utilities \u2013 if they fail, our economic lights go out.</p> <p>So we need to improve the way our financial system is regulated.<br> For a start, we must ensure that the regulators have the capacity to do the job. </p> <p>For too long, City firms have been able to poach the best regulators. </p> <p>So we will ensure that we get more good staff at the FSA, paid for by an increased levy on the City, and introduce a system similar to the Shareholder Executive so that banks send their best people to the FSA on secondment.<br> But the changes we need to ensure financial responsibility run much deeper.</p> <p>We need radical plan to change our approach to debt.<br> We need to reverse the fundamental mistake made a decade ago that meant that the authorities took no view at all over the level of debt in the economy. That view has been central to the financial irresponsibility that allowed debt and asset prices to get out of control. So we will introduce a new Debt Responsibility Mechanism to ensure that this does not happen again. We will instruct the Bank of England to write regularly to the FSA, setting out its concerns about the sustainability of the level of debt in the economy. </p> <p>The FSA will then be obliged to take that view into account when setting the amount of capital individual banks must hold.<br> So if the level of debt is growing unsustainably, the Bank will instruct the FSA to ensure banks either slow their lending or put aside more capital. The Debt Responsibility Mechanism explicitly rejects the irresponsible attitude of the last ten years that we can just let rip on debt, and not care about the consequences.</p> <p>It will be a fundamental and far-reaching reform of monetary policy.</p> <p>If it had been in place over the last ten years we would not have seen taxpayers forced to recapitalise the banks \u2013 they would never have become so fragile in the first place.</p> <p>But real financial responsibility will not be achieved simply through rules - we need a cultural change on the part of bankers too.</p> <p>No longer must they think just that because they are abiding by all the rules, morality goes out the window. </p> <p>Instead, they must recognise the massive responsibility they have to our society. </p> <p>So just as important as setting the right regulation is introducing the right incentives to create the right culture.</p> <p>The problems we currently face have come about because, for the past decade, the incentives have been distorted. </p> <p>The Executives at the very top of our banks were paid according to the short-term profits they made, rather than the success of any long-term decisions they took. </p> <p>So we've got ask the right questions about whether bankers have too many incentives to increase leverage to increase their returns.</p> <p>Rating agencies were paid only if deals were done, so no wonder they gave out AAA ratings like they were going out of fashion. </p> <p>And banks lending people money for their houses securitised the mortgages in order to get rid of the risk. </p> <p>We could respond in two ways.</p> <p>We could write detailed codes and establish an army of enforcers.</p> <p>Or we could get the incentives right \u2013 to steer people in the right direction and then trust them to make their own decisions and live by the consequences.</p> <p>So we should consider requiring the initiator of a mortgage to retain more of an interest in that mortgage.</p> <p>We should ensure that the regulators take Executive compensation schemes into account when regulating institutional risk.</p> <p>And we should look at the way that rating agencies earn their fees, with more transparency and perhaps some relation to the performance of the securities they rate. </p> <p>All of these measures are about retaining the fundamental strength of the market \u2013 freedom \u2013 but endowing it with the fundamental value \u2013 responsibility \u2013 upon which it depends.</p> <p>Sound public finances by restoring fiscal responsibility.</p> <p>The right framework of rules and incentives in the financial markets so we restore financial responsibility. </p> <p>These are necessary if we are to repair our free-enterprise economy for the long-term.</p> <p>But there is a third requirement.</p> <p>A responsible party has to include rebalancing our economy.</p> <p>Over the past decade, seventy percent of our economic growth has come from just three things.</p> <p>From housing \u2013 which is now declining.</p> <p>From the financial sector \u2013 now in turmoil.</p> <p>And from government spending \u2013 now slowing.</p> <p>And in addition, much of the growth has been driven by immigration \u2013 an unsustainable basis when you consider the impact on public services and our national infrastructure.</p> <p>Unlike many other countries in Europe, we can't turn to a strong manufacturing base to provide export-led growth, because manufacturing has shrunk by more than a million jobs over the past decade.</p> <p>And we can't put our faith in the high-tech service sector \u2013 like in America \u2013 to drive growth, because we haven't created the right conditions for it to flourish sufficiently over the past decade.</p> <p>We've got to change this \u2013 and build an economy that is balanced and resilient. </p> <p>We have to broaden our economic base to include more science, more hi-tech services, more green technologies, more engineering and more high-value manufacturing, drawing upon a much wider range of industries, markets, people, towns and cities.</p> <p>And how will get there?</p> <p>We need a radical plan. </p> <p>We need to do far better in bringing into everyday use technologies that are still in laboratories\u2026</p> <p>\u2026and developing in the laboratory technologies that haven't even been thought of yet.</p> <p>We need to reconfigure our energy systems, wean our economy off its dependence on imported hydrocarbons and turn Britain into a world leader in green innovation and engineering.</p> <p>We need to decentralise our economy so the south doesn't overheat and instead every part of our country plays a significant part in our growth.</p> <p>This won't happen overnight. </p> <p>For a start, this means creating an economic framework that enables new businesses to flourish.</p> <p>That is why we are committed to cutting the headline rate of small business tax to 20p, paid for by abolishing complex reliefs. </p> <p>And that is why we have asked David Arculus, a leading businessman and former head of the Better Regulation Task Force, to head an independent task force examining ways in which a Conservative Government could cut red tape.</p> <p>In the weeks ahead, we must not let this Government make the mistake of thinking that the answer to this crisis is to tax and regulate small businesses even more heavily. </p> <p>But creating a balanced enterprise economy is not simply a matter of government<br>getting out of the way. </p> <p>As I have said many times before, while we must be aware of the limitations of Government, we should never be limited in our aspirations for Government. </p> <p>It is not enough for Government to get out of the way \u2013 they've got to get involved.</p> <p>Government must also do more to secure the skills, energy and transport infrastructure that will help create new jobs in new industries and new markets.</p> <p>That's why we have set out a radical agenda of supply side reform in the education system, to create more and better school places in every community. </p> <p>That's why we are committed to a bold series of environmental policies, from feed-in tariffs for microgeneration to unleashing a green coal revolution.</p> <p>That's why we have proposed a series of policies to make it easier for innovative start-up businesses to win government contracts.</p> <p>And that's why we have pledged to introduce a high speed rail system that will link cities across Britain and transform regional economies. </p> <p>This is the right vision, the right plan, and above all, the right ambition, to create a balanced economy that is built to last. </p> <p>Britain has incredible resources at its disposal.</p> <p>World beating companies.</p> <p>Some of the best, brightest and most creative minds. </p> <p>Universities that are envy of the planet.</p> <p>But as we look at the wreckage of our economy after ten years of irresponsible Government, it's clear that if we're going to make the most of those resources we need change \u2013 not more of the same.</p> <p>Gordon Brown is hoping that his whirlwind of summitry will mean that we will forget what has come before.</p> <p>Forget that he stripped the Bank of England of its powers to supervise the city.</p> <p>Forget he accelerated - how he actively encouraged - the risk taking culture in our banks.</p> <p>Forget that he promised - time and time again - that he had abolished boom and bust.</p> <p>Forget that \u2013 as we enter a downturn, where jobs, home and livelihoods will be lost \u2013 that he was the one who created this mess in the first place. </p> <p>But I won't forget \u2013 and the British people won't forget.</p> <p>A fire has engulfed the house that is our economy.</p> <p>Stopping the fire from spreading \u2013 averting an even deeper financial crisis - has required everyone \u2013 opposition included \u2013 to man the pumps.</p> <p>Now, no doubt, Labour will start to talk about emergency repairs.</p> <p>But this isn't good enough. It's time to construct a house that is genuinely built to last.</p> <p>And we will only build an economy that is strong and there to last if we\u2026</p> <p>\u2026apply the same philosophy as I have been advocating in the social sphere for the last three years\u2026</p> <p>\u2026the philosophy of responsibility.</p> <p>To repair the broken society, in the long-term, we need social responsibility.</p> <p>And to repair the broken economy, in the long-term, we need economic responsibility.</p> <p>That means\u2026</p> <p>\u2026a responsible fiscal policy, bolstered by independent oversight\u2026</p> <p>\u2026a responsible financial policy, bolstered by a renewed role for the Bank of England\u2026</p> <p>\u2026and a responsible attitude to economic development, that fosters more balanced economic growth.</p> <p>And today, it's only the Conservative Party that is offering that change.</p>",

Internet surfers clicking on advertisements helped to drive the firm's profits up 26%.</p> <p>The company also drove down its costs by cutting back on capital expenses and holding back on hiring new staff.</p> <p>Analysts had lowered their expectations for Google's results in the three months to September after fears that the credit crisis was weighing on other web companies and could spread to the internet search market.</p> <p>But Google's focus on highly targeted online adverts appears to be better suited for weathering a slowdown in consumer spending, analysts argued.

The spreading financial crisis is expected to hurt the internet advertising market as businesses cut spending or disappear altogether.</p> <p>The Google chief executive, Eric Schmidt, described the current economic predicament as \"uncharted territory\". While the group held up in the third quarter, Schmidt was cautious going forward, saying that the company would be \"very responsible in the management of our expenses\".</p> <p>\"What we have concluded is that we are going to keep doing our thing,\" Schmidt said in an interview. \"There is no change in the plan at Google. We'll ride this thing out.\"</p> <p>Google grew by 519 employees, down from 2,130 a year ago, in what is typically a big hiring quarter. The company, which gives its employees free meals and other perks, now has 20,123 employees. Capital expenditures fell 18% from the second quarter to $452m .</p> <p>\"It probably wasn't the leanest ship on the sea,\" said Anthony Valencia, media analyst for TCW Group. \"Now they have shown they can rein things in and show good profitability without hurting continued investment in long-term growth initiatives.\"</p> <p>Google, which already has more than 70% of US search advertising spending, is looking to spur growth through new advertising strategies with possible opportunities in the video-sharing site, YouTube. Analysts are broadly confident about Google's growth prospects for the coming years.</p> <p>Shares in Google, which have lost nearly 20% in the past month, jumped 10% on the back of the results.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Yahoo also enjoyed strong share gains of 10.5% to $12.99 after the Microsoft chief executive, Steve Ballmer, suggested that his company would consider renewing discussions with Yahoo over a search partnership. </p> <p>Microsoft had offered as much as $47.5bn this spring to buy Yahoo, which spurned the offer and struck an advertising partnership with Google.</p>",
  "<p>More signs that the global financial crisis is hitting the real economy has come from car dealer <strong>Inchcape</strong>, which has just issued a profit warning.</p> <p>The company said consumer confidence had been hit hard, especially with regard to big ticket items, so profits for both 2008 and 2009 would be below expectations. It plans a restructuring which will cost \u00a355m but save \u00a350m a year.<br></p> <p>In the current febrile market conditions, any company that issues bad news tends to get hammered.

  "<p>Eleven climate change activists are due in court today on criminal charges after they blockaded a planned $1.8bn coal-fired power plant, providing an American echo of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/11/activists.kingsnorthclimatecamp\">Kingsnorth Six</a> trial.</p> <p>The activists were arrested last month in rural Wise County, Virginia, at the gates of a power plant being built by Dominion, the No 2 utility in the US. The 11 <a href=\"http://www.mountainjustice.org/events.php?id=102\">chained themselves to steel barrels</a> that held aloft a banner, lit by solar panels, challenging the utility to provide cleaner energy for a region ravaged by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/25/mining.energy\">abusive coal mining</a>.</p> <p>Charged with unlawful assembly and obstruction of justice, the group has been dubbed the Dominion 11 in homage to Kingsnorth. Dr James Hansen, the leading US climate change scientist, has followed his testimony on behalf of the Kingsnorth protesters with an offer of help to the Virginia activists.</p> <p>The Americans have yet to attract the national attention won by their counterparts in the UK. But for Hannah Morgan, a member of the 11, her case is only one chapter in a long battle against the coal industry that has been raging under the general public's radar.<br> \"Civil disobedience is something that can be incredibly effective, but it needs to be part of a larger campaign,\" the 20-year-old Morgan said.</p> <p>In that spirit, opponents of the Wise County plant have staged more than a dozen demonstrations since the facility was first proposed 18 months ago. During the same week that a dozen activists protested outside Dominion headquarters, lawyers for the Sierra Club and other groups were pleading with state air quality officials to deny permits to the plant, which would emit 5.37m tonnes of CO2 every year.</p> <p>Nine of the 11 face four misdemeanour charges at today's hearing, each of which carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $1,000 fine, according to Michael Abbott, the county's deputy commonwealth attorney. </p> <p>The remaining two, including Morgan, have also been charged with criminal trespassing and encouraging unlawful assembly. Whether they plan to use climate change to defend their protest as necessary, as the Kingsnorth Six did, remains to be seen.</p> <p>\"It's hard to say how the courts would react to an argument like that without making it,\" Morgan said. \"We thought we might be setting a precedent through this legal process, and we might be.\"</p> <p>If a climate-based defence is mounted, the odds are likely stacked against the Dominion 11. None in the group currently lives full-time in Wise County, where coal remains a way of life even as mountaintop-removal mining destroys the local landscape. </p> <p>In addition, Dominion is one of the most powerful lobbying forces in Virginia, giving more than $1m in campaign donations on the local level since 1993. Tim Kaine, the state's Democratic governor, received more than $135,000. </p> <p>\"It tells us something about where we are in the United States, where the public education is, the fact that special interests have succeeded in misinforming the public,\" Hansen said via e-mail. </p> <p>\"That only emphasizes the fact that the wrong people were on trial in this case. It is the people on the other side of the docket who should be placed on trial. Especially those at the top of the heap.\"</p> <p>No matter what the outcome of today's hearing, the group has succeeded in raising awareness of anti-coal activism in the US.

  "<p>John Lewis, the employee-owned chain seen as a barometer of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail\">retail</a> sector, has reported another drop in weekly sales as the financial crisis hits consumer confidence.</p> <p>Total sales across its department stores and Waitrose supermarkets tumbled by 2.2% in the week to October 11, reflecting the current volatility in the economy. Sales in its 27 department sales fell 8%.</p> <p>The British retailer blamed good weather and consumers' response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">the global financial crisis</a> for the shortfall.</p> <p>\"Last week started with great promise, with sales rising 7% on Sunday and 9% on Monday, but as the financial news worsened and the sun started to shine, so did our trade fall away,\" John Lewis said.</p> <p>The bleak economic outlook and the financial turmoil have collectively battered high street sales and retail confidence.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the British Retail Consortium's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/retail-highstreetretailers\">latest snapshot</a> of the retail sector showed that large price cuts and promotions failed to stem the slump in sales as consumers continued to rein in their spending.</p> <p>However, John Lewis had enjoyed a brief and much-needed boost to trade in the previous week, to October 2, when shoppers raced to snap up warmer clothing. The launch of the retailer's Christmas collection also supported the group's total sales which rose by 0.9%. Hot water bottles and women's shoes were the strongest sellers.</p> <p>But the rise was only marginal, department sales still fell by 0.5% - a marginal improvement from the 8% plunge at the end of September.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/03/climatechange.energy\">Secretary of state for energy and climate</a>, in a government that is approving new runways as fast as they can be proposed, is poised to sign off on new coal power and seems desperate to indulge in a bit of Cold War nostalgia by resurrecting nuclear power. That's no recipe for an easy life.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband\">Ed Miliband</a>'s indication that he is supportive of moving the UK emissions reduction target from 60% by 2050 to 80% is a good start \u2013 although it merely shows the government finally admitting that what environmentalists told them several years ago was right all along. But the real question is, can he deliver?</p> <p>Certainly, early indications suggest he faces exactly the same problem as former, non-cabinet, climate change ministers \u2013 he has a room full of colleagues who do not believe it is practical to care about the environment in which we live, and he is stuck with the job of green-washing their half-hearted stabs at the issue.</p> <p>In the same <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/16/greenpolitics-edmiliband\">interview in which he leaned towards the 80% target</a>, Miliband lamented the \"lack of faith\" with which the green movement regards the establishment parties. He protests: \"We are absolutely committed to 30% [EU-wide emissions reductions]. I want to be very clear about this. I am also very clear that if Britain is to play an important role in international negotiations, then we have to lead by example.\"</p> <p>Our faith in the government is so limited because the actions of Labour ministers in real international negotiations demonstrate that these affirmations for the domestic audience are, charitably put, spin. As an MEP, I get to see up close just how far from all this concerned rhetoric the government's behaviour really is.<br> In March 2007, ministers agreed that the EU must unilaterally reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% on 1990 levels if a future global climate agreement is reached. The European Council of member states' leaders is now calling this commitment into question, as well as trying to undermine EU emissions reductions still further by allowing for a maximum of whatever targets they do agree to be met by offsetting abroad. The UK government is one of the most active on this last point. As for the precise policies, among many other worrying moves it seems the council is back-peddling on the \"polluter pays\" principle that's supposed to underpin and incentivise emissions reductions via the emissions trading system; and to oppose the idea of ring-fencing money raised through emissions trading for climate-related purposes both at home and abroad. To cap it all, ministers have been doing their best to lock in their inadequate ambition, by making their agreements this week so detailed that they will claim no room for manoeuvre when it comes to negotiations with the European Parliament \u2013 the democratically elected co-legislator. This is unacceptable and irresponsible, and will jeopardise the chances of having a deal in time for the Poznan talks. The UK has also been caught trying to wriggle out of EU agreements to increase renewable energy capacity \u2013 essential not only for climate security but also our economic future. The target is for 20% of all energy consumption \u2013 electricity, heating, transport and so on \u2013 to be generated from renewable sources. Miliband has now joined the government's effort to exclude aviation from that energy total, saying: \"There is not a credible way of showing aviation can be driven by renewables.\"</p> <p>Miliband is an intelligent man, so I can only conclude he is being deliberately misleading. No one is suggesting we can fuel aircraft renewably \u2013 at least not yet. What we are saying is that aviation fuel must, as has always been foreseen, be included in the figures used to calculate what constitutes total energy consumption. Removing it would dilute the commitment, not to mention the political consequences of opening up the whole Pandora's box of individual member states' national targets. With this kind of twisting and obfuscation, is it any wonder that we lack faith in the government?</p> <p>If Miliband is going to make a success of his historic appointment to cabinet as the first climate change secretary of state, then he has to be straight with us, and straight with cabinet.</p> <p>He has to get through to his colleagues that business as usual is not only environmental suicide, but also economically unviable. We will not survive in the economy of the future without a world-class renewable energy sector, and Labour's attempts to avoid attracting one do no one any favours.</p> <p>Strong policies that sufficiently incentivise wind power, for example, could result in an avoided fuel cost of \u20ac20.5bn by 2020 across the EU alone and provide more than 500,000 jobs.<br> We won't solve the environmental and economic crises with inertia and spin. We need a green new deal: in other words, based upon the precedent of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal\">Roosevelt's New Deal</a> of the 1930s, we need the reregulation of international finance, an end to subsidies for coal and nuclear, and a major programme of public and private investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency, generating thousands of green-collar jobs in the process.</p> <p>We can make the transition away from fossil fuels and avoid a huge economic downturn at the same time. But it's going to take a lot more than faith.</p>",
