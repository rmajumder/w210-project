  "<p>The global economy is in meltdown, yet the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a> want to spend \u00a3150m on an academy scheme - just to get round the 90-minute rule on how far kids can travel to their existing football academies? It sounds absurd. Premier League football may think itself immune to the pressures of the economy, but with Uefa president Michel Platini, among others, talking about the need to draw in the purse strings, it is a good time to start waking up to reality.</p> <p>In the past TV revenues have filled a super-duper pot of money at Premier League rights auctions, but in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">current financial climate</a> how secure are the TV companies themselves? Advertising revenue is down and the average householder is beginning to feel the pinch, so how long before subscriptions go down and TV companies stumble? </p> <p>Over lunch with the England lads last week, we debated the new proposals. Huge investment sums aside, some of us felt the most disturbing aspect was encouraging 11-year-old kids to leave home to chase a dream. The whole idea has more in common with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory than a sensible career plan - hoping for a golden ticket to a football megastar future. </p> <p>When I was 11 I never thought about a career in football, I just loved playing. Is it morally right to be pushing football careers to 11-year-olds? I still wince every time a parent comes up to me and says their kid, aged seven, is enrolled in an academy. That's just plain wrong. Football shouldn't be about kids becoming superstars, it should just be about having fun. </p> <p>There's something weirdly X Factor about it all, hundreds of hopefuls dreaming of making it through to the final. Who knows, with TV revenue helping to fund the academies, how long before they want a piece of the action and the public start voting kids off the show?</p> <p>Despite my reservations, I do think there is scope for the Premier League to consider regionalised academies - but only if the pupils there were independent of any one club. It is too much pressure for a young footballer to have a club shelling out \u00a325,000 a year for their education, and it just perpetuates the cycle of agents grabbing at them and individual clubs enjoying a monopoly of the best players.</p> <p>Instead, why not adopt a US-style draft system whereby on graduation, aged 16, each youngster is put up for selection to Premier League teams. If the investment by the Premier League clubs is focused on developing academies to produce world-class footballers rather than helping already dominant clubs to extend their control over the best young players, then every club will have a more even chance of success.</p> <p>That's the beauty of the NFL draft system, it allows a more competitive and less predictable outcome each season. As a result the league reinvents itself every few years and there isn't a single side dominating the league over the course of a decade, like we so often see in top-flight football here. </p> <p>The plans would be more friendly to the Football League, too, who could recruit any players not selected by Premier League clubs - after five years of elite training these youngsters would be the best leftovers in football, without any investment from the lower league.</p> <p>The whole system would need a strong ethical backbone. An emphasis on education - not just the national curriculum, but a football education including basic refereeing and sports-science qualifications that would give youngsters the foundation of a career in football even if they did not make it as superstar players. Pupils should include a quantity of girls and disabled footballers - why should elite facilities and coaching only be made available to able-bodied young men? The message that football is for everyone should be encouraged at every level. </p> <p>The system would relieve the FA of the financial burden of developing young talent; instead they could step away from the academy side of things and concentrate on supporting grassroots football and raising the profile of the game. </p> <p>In a climate of money-grabbing and 'me, me, me' attitudes, this structure would adopt a more holistic approach. There would be tangible benefits to a wider community than just the Premier League elite, and yet the incentives for investment by the clubs are clear: they would be able to choose from a crop of talented, matured youngsters, rather than having to take the gamble of trying to select the next top goalkeeper when the kid is aged 11. It is time for a change in attitude from football's top tier and this could be the start of it. </p> <h2>Nuts over trophy</h2> <p>A very big thank you to the Football Supporters' Federation for presenting me with a special award on the pitch last Sunday (below) for my Observer columns. One of the FSF ladies kindly said the gang at their headquarters read every word. Well I have their magazine sent to me and always read their articles, which help give me a fans' perspective on things. The trophy will go in my kitchen with the rest of the silverware, including last season's proud addition - the Nuts worst hairdo of the year award, for my Clark Kent impression.</p> <p><em>David James has donated his fee for this column to charity</em></p>",
  "<p>You might think you'd heard all you needed of the Buena Vistas gang \u2013 the 1997 classic album sold eight million copies \u2013 but this live double album, recorded in July 1998, offers another take on those great songs. It was one of only two concerts by the full ensemble, even while it became clear that they were set to become a global phenomenon.</p>",
  "<p>The last competitive international break of the year provides a handy pause for a snapshot of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a>, gloriously unpredictable after seven games with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity\">Hull</a> in a Champions League position and winless <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenhamhotspur\">Tottenham</a> rooted to the bottom of the table. </p> <p>While that may change over the course of the season, one thing it is safe to say at present is that Phil Brown appears to be doing his job better than Juande Ramos. The Hull boss has deservedly been named manager of the month after supervising away victories at Arsenal and Spurs, while the man who took Tottenham to Carling Cup success last season may not get another month unless his players buck up their ideas fairly smartish. </p> <p>One could not go so far as to assert that Brown is a better manager than Ramos - he has yet even to sample European football, let alone win back-to-back Uefa Cups - and the feeling that the former Sevilla manager has been undermined by his own board of directors' ruinous transfer-market policy grew last weekend with a series of starring performances by former Spurs players at their new clubs. Dimitar Berbatov, Jermain Defoe, Robbie Keane and Steed Malbranque are the new darlings of Manchester United, Portsmouth, Liverpool and Sunderland respectively, while Spurs have been underwhelmed by their major summer signings. Luka Modric and Roman Pavlyuchenko are now injured and David Bentley has lost his England place. </p> <p>There is a strong suspicion that Spurs, like Newcastle, have made life difficult for their manager by diluting his direct control over first-team matters with other individuals involved in buying and selling, and for that reason it is impossible to say Brown would fare any better under present circumstances at White Hart Lane. Which is just as well, since Spurs would never have appointed him. They wanted a continental manager to go with their continental scouting and recruitment system. They were never remotely interested in hiring an Englishman when they lost confidence in Martin Jol last year - indeed Jol has just revealed they were looking at Ramos the season before.</p> <p>Why, you may ask, are people persevering with football directors and continental systems when it seems much easier to do what Hull did and go out and find a decent manager? Why, for that matter, have West Ham just appointed Gianfranco Zola when they have never previously had an overseas manager? It's not as if there are no decent English candidates about. West Ham were thumped 3-1 at home last Saturday by the Ginger Mourinho, as Bolton's resolutely unglamorous and archetypally English Gary Megson is affectionately known.</p> <p>Bolton will never win any style awards, it is true, yet all those years as Sam Allardyce's assistant do not appear to have done Brown any harm. His Hull team are not playing with one man up front and nine behind the ball, they are winning praise for their positive, attractive football. Allardyce himself is still available, his unhappy relationship with the Newcastle fans having left him all but unemployable, though it should be remembered that, before Mike Ashley brought Dennis Wise, a continental-style recruitment system and a daily dose of hilarity to the club, the former Bolton manager was the choice of the old board precisely because they wanted stability and gradual growth. </p> <p>Outside the Premier League are promising English managers a-plenty, from Aidy Boothroyd at Watford and Kevin Blackwell at Sheffield United to Paul Simpson at Shrewsbury, the last responsible for two 7-0 wins in the past month. Even inside the Premier League there is no shortage of locally produced managerial talent. There are currently eight English club managers, plus another seven from Ireland, Scotland or Wales. </p> <p>That does not sound too bad, but look more closely at the clubs managed by Englishmen. None of them are Champions League material. Only one is playing in Europe and, while Portsmouth winning the FA Cup was a thrill for Harry Redknapp and the supporters, the club now appear to be broke. </p> <p>If you can't make money out of a Cup run any more and the lucrative Champions League is operating as a closed shop, success must be redefined. Installing football directors and continental systems can to some extent be seen as an attempt to make money from trading players. Spurs did not factor a visit to the bottom of the table into their thinking, though they did make more than \u00a350m in summer from the sale of Keane and Berbatov alone, and had they given themselves a little more time to find replacements they might now be looking at a more comfortable league position and a worthwhile profit. </p> <p>It was Newcastle, however, who explained the situation most succinctly. Kevin Keegan had to go, it was put out, because he had daft, crowd-pleasing ideas such as signing Thierry Henry when Newcastle did not have the money. What Newcastle wanted to do instead was use a sophisticated scouting system to beat Ars\u00e8ne Wenger at his own game and sign the next Cesc F\u00e1bregas, or spot a future Henry as a youth. </p> <p>The hypothetical question of what Newcastle would have done with such players - would they have delivered titles, like Arsenal, then sold at a profit, or were they just interested in the profit? - will never be answered. Ashley has lost interest in the club and stands to lose money. Tony Jimenez, their vice-president in charge of recruitment, has just quit. The experiment seems to be over. If and when Ashley finds a buyer the odds are that Newcastle will revert to a more traditional managerial model, perhaps even with an English manager. </p> <p>With Zola waiting to see how much of West Ham survives the Icelandic banking crisis, all eyes are on Ramos and Spurs. Should the manager pay the price for further poor results, that ought not to mean the end of the system - the whole point of the continental model is that once in place coaches become as interchangeable as players - though the structure and a whole lot more could go out of the window if Spurs end up in what we in England call a relegation dog-fight. Could the season get any sillier after Joe Kinnear at Newcastle? Of course it could. Big Sam for Spurs, anyone?</p> <h2>Another share in the credit crunch issue</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool\">Liverpool's</a> plans for a new ground have been stalled by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> and a degree of uncertainty over future ownership of the club. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/everton\">Everton</a> are still insisting there is nowhere to relocate except the unpopular site at Kirkby, yet there are no plans to do the obvious thing and share a super stadium now that Stanley Park has been made available for development.</p> <p>There is no desire among the fans to share a stadium, Liverpool's Rick Parry has explained, and he is probably right. On the other hand, there was no conspicuous desire among the fans to be sold into American ownership, and Liverpool did not let that hold them back.</p> <p>Ground-sharing might be a no-no for haughty neighbours who derive a great deal of pleasure from hating each other, but ground vandalism is another matter. Liverpool are perfectly entitled to build a new greenfield stadium if they wish, as soon as they feel they can afford it, though a ground as historic and fit for purpose as Anfield deserves a better fate than the bulldozers. Especially when Everton, with the myopia that comes naturally to partners in football rivalry, claim they have searched the whole city and cannot find a stadium-sized gap anywhere.</p> <p>The City of Culture should slap a preservation order on Anfield, which is at least as famous and well loved as the statelier buildings on the waterfront, to conserve it for posterity. It may be difficult in a few years' time for anyone to remember what traditional grounds used to be like. Anfield could be transported brick by brick and turned into a Pier Head tourist attraction. Alternatively it could stay where it is and be kept alive by getting Everton to play in it, if necessary with a cattle prod. </p> <h2>Rorting on the wall for salary cap</h2> <p>Rorting is what they call it in Australia, where any number of ingenious ways of getting round a salary cap have been discovered, and often not discovered, in recent years. Salary caps have their place in keeping spending sensible within necessarily competitive sporting structures, though they work best in smallish, self-contained, even isolated sports such as rugby league. It is hard to imagine how a unilateral cap could succeed in the global sport of football, and even harder to envisage the Premier League risking its status as most-watched, best-rewarded and highest-rolling league in the world by inviting all its expensively imported stars to up sticks.</p> <p>But bring it on, by all means. It will be fun trying to apply wage and spending restraint to a sport with notorious issues of transparency over player ownership, club ownership, use and remuneration of agents, and transfers generally. Football could never even make any of its bung inquiries stick, and soon it might be too late. A salary cap is a challenge, an invitation to be creative, if not downright devious. It almost becomes part of the game. And rorts, like bungs, will become part of the language.</p>",
  "<p>This story begins with an ending. On 11 April 2003, Thomas Hurndall, a 21-year-old photojournalist, was shot in the head in Gaza by a sniper from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/israelandthepalestinians\">Israeli</a> army. </p> <p>Tom was a brilliant, intrepid young man, driven by an energetic morality, a wish to make a difference in the world. The shooting left him with unsurvivable brain damage, but he clung to life - against the odds - in a coma, for nine months. </p> <p>While he lay dying in Tel Aviv and later in the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London, his parents, Anthony and Jocelyn Hurndall, took on a heroic struggle against the Israeli army. They were determined to seek truth and accountability at all costs. They had no idea how hard this was going to be.</p> <p>The Israeli army appeared to view Tom's death with indifference; there were no plans to investigate the shooting, interview witnesses or go to Gaza. Nor, at first, were they willing to meet the Hurndalls. Their claim was that their soldier had fired at an armed terrorist. Tom, dressed in an orange jacket (a known sign for peace workers), was unarmed. What's more he was shot while rescuing Palestinian children. </p> <p>Faced with lies and silence, Anthony, a commercial lawyer, did the only thing he could: he took the case on himself. It was his meticulous investigation that led to the prosecution of Bedouin sniper Sergeant Wahid Taysir, who got eight years (the longest sentence ever received by an Israeli Defence Forces soldier for shooting an unarmed civilian in the occupied territories). Vengeance was not Anthony's motivation. He wanted only to find out what had happened. But the verdict was, in the bleakest way imaginable, a personal victory.</p> <p>Jocelyn has told her story in a beautifully written, uncompromising book, My Son Tom (Bloomsbury). More riskily, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4\">Channel 4</a> has turned the story into a drama to be broadcast tomorrow: The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall, written by Simon Block and directed by Rowan Joffe. Stephen Dillane plays Anthony and Kerry Fox plays Jocelyn. The film manages to be neither sensational nor sentimental - quite a feat. </p> <p>It is its understatement that overwhelms. Anthony and Jocelyn divorced several years before Tom's death and the film conveys the strained decency of their relationship and their admirable transcending of differences. </p> <p>The three surviving children - Sophie, Bill and Fred - are carefully characterised, and what the film spells out is that the shooting of Tom was a shattering of the entire family. Each of them took the impact of the sniper's fire. But I wondered if the film might have taken some emotional liberties too: Anthony is seen to be all head, Jocelyn all heart. And they are presented in rivalrous stances, as if we are being asked to choose between them. Was it really like that? </p> <p>I met the Hurndalls separately: Anthony first, on a cold autumn day, in his offices near the Bank of England. He is tall, with a shambling gait, and is absolutely direct. You don't feel any slipperiness, any side. I liked him at once and admired his ability to talk with clarity about complicated issues. At the same time, he often left sentences unfinished as if he lacked the will to complete them. I noticed how often he leant back and shut his eyes when speaking, as if closing his eyes would have the opposite effect - make it possible to see.</p> <p>For Anthony, the film is a 'further memorial' to Tom. But what matters most to him is that audiences should understand that what happened was 'not a freak accident, but a product of a policy that the Israeli armed forces were adopting in Gaza'. There is barely suppressed outrage in his voice as he remembers the British government's failure to protest when Tom was shot: 'The government viewed Israel as a close ally who they did not want to put out in any way.'</p> <p>It was only when a Tel Aviv bar was bombed by two British Muslims three weeks after the shooting of Tom in 2003 that Anthony became aware of how skewed the British government's attitude could be. 'Jack Straw expressed deep sympathy to the Israelis and promised to put all the resources of the British government at their disposal. This was our government taking responsibility for two people who were not employees of the British government, merely two citizens of Britain who happened to be in Israel.'</p> <p>But when their own British citizens (Tom, along with Iain Hook, a UN worker shot by an Israeli sniper in November 2002, and James Miller, a documentary-maker shot by an IDF patrol in May 2003) were attacked by Israeli soldiers, there was no outcry (no ministerial interest at all, beyond a standard request, from a junior level, for a proper inquiry). 'They were shot not by people for whom the Israeli government had no responsibility but by their own soldiers. That, for me, was outrageous.'</p> <p>Anthony approves of the film and thinks Dillane got a lot of things right. But he resists the idea of himself as the 'dry lawyer'. He feels a 'little put out' at a scene in which he is in a hurry to get back to the office while Jocelyn waits devotedly by Tom's bedside: 'It was not like that.' He finds Dillane's Anthony 'more confident than I am. I am much more uncertain about things.' He admits he can switch gear into 'detached' mode and adds: 'I do live in my head.' But he wants it on record that 'there is a lot of emotion there'. </p> <p>I don't doubt it. The way he uses Tom's name as emotional shorthand reveals the strength of his feelings: 'When I heard that Tom had been shot, I felt angry and worried, but already I knew that if this had happened, this was Tom doing something which was Tom. When we heard he had been going to rescue children - that was absolutely Tom. He had this strong, protective urge - a tremendous feeling of caring about putting things right.' </p> <p>It was Tom's need to put things right that became, for Anthony, an unspoken direction, an imperative. He remembers it like this: 'Tom, you are lying there. This is what you want. This is what we are going to do for you, Tom - with you.' That 'with' is affecting because the more accurate word would have been 'without'.</p> <p>Anthony describes Tom as a little boy who was 'troubled', although 'outgoing', and 'determined to do his own thing'. He 'hated arrogance', intellectual or otherwise. He was much loved because he was 'always there for people. He would talk to anybody, on any level, about anything.' </p> <p>Tom was 15 or 16 when his parents split up. 'Being the angry teenager he was, we didn't talk for a while,' Anthony recalls. But football (Arsenal) and photography were shared passions. And by the time Tom left England in 2003, 'we had re-established quite close bonds. We were still a little aloof but much closer. We discussed his preparations for the trip. I remember talking about what he was going to do to keep safe.' </p> <p>Tom also discussed the trip with his 'very closest friends, who happened to be Jewish'. But his attitude would have been: 'I want to find out for myself.'</p> <p>It is painful listening to Anthony piecing together the past, trying to reconfigure his relationship with Tom before he died. I suggest that it was remarkable that he and Jocelyn managed to work together with such dignity. 'There have been enormous stresses,' he admits. 'Don't be under any illusions about that, but I think we are now closer in many ways.' </p> <p>Before I leave, I hear myself asking - I hadn't meant to put it so baldly - how much Tom's death has changed his life? 'The whole experience has changed my view of life and of what is important,' he answers. He describes being 'in the City, in a bar, seeing people have a good time - it seems completely unreal'. He admits he has lost the taste for 'life's pleasures'. 'Work is what matters.'</p> <p>Anthony's work now is to create a forum for people to solve their legal difficulties outside the court. He finds, in this good-hearted project, an af finity with Tom. But he remains hard on himself. He believes that because of Tom's death: 'I am a lesser parent. I don't take the children on holidays.' He bought some golf clubs: 'They haven't been out of the cupboard.'</p> <p>He feels that Tom's death has made him more spiritual: 'I used to read to Tom in intensive care. I spent hours with him. I read the Koran for the first time and Taoism. It was a time for contemplation, working out what was important.' </p> <p>Gaza, he explains, was 'so dramatic and powerful. The best journalist cannot portray the reality of what is happening. What is an Israeli-only road? What is a checkpoint?' He believes we have 'so little idea of what is happening'.</p> <p>Grief, he recognises, can make you see more keenly. It has also made the political personal: 'I remember saying to someone [about Gaza and the Middle Eastern conflict] the Israelis can't say the problem is only theirs. This is now our issue.'</p> <p>Jocelyn Hurndall lives in Tufnell Park, north London. She has a radiance that is immediately attractive. But faces carry their recent emotional history and her grief is as indelible as a watermark. She wonders whether we might sit in her garden. It is a is lovely, peaceful, idiosyncratic place - a shrine of sorts. I exclaim at the tiny, weeping silver birch at its centre: 'It was planted for Tom,' she says. 'It's going to make me cry.' 'Don't,' I say. 'It's doing your weeping for you.' I feel an immediate rapport with this woman whose emotions, five years on, are still so close to the surface, so available to her.</p> <p>In her book, she wrote: 'People know about death in the Middle East... it is one of the things that gives life there its vibrancy. In the West we are not forced to look death in the face in the same way - we barely acknowledge its existence. We take our lives very much for granted.' Tom's death has changed that permanently: 'I never take my life for granted.'</p> <p>She tells me: 'Tom valued the moment, the meaning of things. I respect that. It is what I have learnt from him.' And after his death, she learnt that being able to 'meet the moment' was an essential part of grieving too - not running away even from the most agonising details: the scent of Tom's clothes, the look of his handwriting. </p> <p>We talk about gardening, how it insists you live in the present (but with an optimistic eye on the future). Her hands, she says, have been roughened by it, but it has helped her heart. Being able to garden is emotional progress for her. 'For a long while I could not look at anything beautiful - lichen, for example, that has taken a lifetime to grow on a stone. I couldn't look at the beauty of this world without thinking about what Tom had lost.'</p> <p>The film conveys the profound alienation after Tom's death - the shock of being pitched from London into a Middle East war zone. Isn't grief itself like this; doesn't it bring with it a feeling of being in a foreign country, an attendant unreality? A sense of not being at home in your own skin? She agrees. 'Back then, even being with a group of friends felt foreign. You weren't able to give anything back - and that was shocking.' </p> <p>One insight in her book is that a family is seldom united by grief. Mourning is an individual thing, a lonely road. I can see (as Jocelyn herself recognises) that her emotional articulacy might not always have been easy for her family. And it must have been hard for her too. Looking back, she finds Anthony's grieving 'completely different' from hers because 'it was so far under the surface'. She says: 'My brain was shot. He seemed to be able to use his.' Her son Billy was different again. He coped by completely rebuilding his little brother Fred's room after Tom's death, an awesome job for a boy with no formal carpenter's training. Jocelyn is still so proud of this that she takes me to inspect his handiwork. </p> <p>I wonder how Jocelyn feels now about allowing a child, albeit a grown-up child, to go to a war zone. 'When Tom first said he was going away [Iraq was his initial destination], I froze. I could not speak when I found out my challenging, extremely bright son was planning to do this. I felt: how could he put us through this?'</p> <p>It was a long time before she was able to respect his decision. Now she believes 'we learn so much from risk takers', from people not content to 'sit on their comfortable sofas'. She remembers Tom asking her 'why a 21-year-old on the other side of the world should live a much more difficult life than I do in London'. She salutes his thinking: 'He saw acceptance of difference as one of the answers to the universe,' and she agrees with him: 'Inclusion is essential - on climate change, on banking crises. We need to think in a more global way.'</p> <p>Since Tom's death, Jocelyn no longer works as a head of learning support at a state school. She is, instead, the director of the Middle East charity Friends of Birzeit University, which raises funds for academic scholarships for Palestinian students. 'It is to do with education for an oppressed group who experience barriers to learning,' she says. Her daughter, Sophie, has also gravitated towards charity work; in her case, Map (Medical Aid for Palestinians). She has become an exceptionally effective campaigner (the importance of her role in the family has been written out of the film).</p> <p>Jocelyn hopes the film will make audiences 'abandon an emotional response to the conflict and make an objective attempt to open their minds to what this is really about. Highly intelligent people often lose all their logic about this conflict.' It is interesting that just as Anthony wants me to know that he is emotional, she wants me to know she can be logical. But both Hurndalls want people to know what is happening in Gaza. Her eyes blaze as she describes the 'wanton destruction of people's homes'. She wishes she could bring politicians in 'by the busload' to see what she has seen. </p> <p>And yet it is clear that Jocelyn will never find it possible to abandon the emotional response to the Middle East conflict. 'The life-changing moment for me was when Fred, who was only 12, was interviewed by the BBC. \"How do you feel?\" they asked him. He was standing next to Tom's blood on the ground. He was like a ghost. He said, \"They shot my brother, he was doing something good, he was rescuing children.\"' </p> <p>She tells me that part of Tom's legacy is the realisation that how a story is told is crucial - words matter to her, as they did to him, tremendously. It is this that suddenly reminds me to ask her about the Israeli judge who passed sentence in words so unjudiciously lyrical they take the breath away. She knows 'nothing about him', she says, but continues to cherish the words he chose. This was his summing up: 'Sergeant Wahid Taysir caused a soul to leave this world. He spilt the blood of a young man in the bloom of youth, causing the loss of an entire world. When that young man was alive, there was no one else like him, and there will never be anyone like him again.'</p> <p>\u2022 The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall will be broadcast on C4 Monday October 13 at 9pm </p> <p>\u2022 Friends of Birzeit University campaigns for the educational rights of Palestinian students.

  "<p>Last week, we said cash was king. But as we have seen with the 300,000 British depositors in Icesave, the online banking subsidiary of collapsed Icelandic bank Landsbanki, over the past few days, that is not necessarily true.</p> <p>Even if your savings are in a safe place - deposits in both Northern Rock and NS&amp;I are completely underwritten by the government - rates on accounts could fall following last week's Bank of England interest rate cut. We have tried to identify some alternatives in the form of funds and shares for those who do not want to keep all their money in savings. </p> <p>With stock markets in meltdown, you may think this a very foolish move. Indeed, we would caution that there are no guaranteed safe havens at the moment, and while there will eventually be money to be made as the bear market ends, it could run for some time. </p> <p>Do not invest money in the stock market, directly or through a fund, unless you are prepared to see it fall before it recovers, and to take a long-term view. You should also consider drip feeding money into the market through a regular savings scheme rather than making a lump sum investment. Sam Morse, manager of Fidelity MoneyBuilder Growth Fund, says: 'Anyone willing to take a five- to ten-year view should continue to stay invested, and the bold may even view the current conditions as an opportunity to add to their holdings. Dripping money into the market through regular savings plans is a tried and tested means of riding out volatility in share prices.'</p> <p>Mark Dampier of independent financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown agrees: 'I'm passionate about this - I've just increased the amount I'm saving for my son. Some people are stopping their regular savings schemes, and that's absolutely the wrong thing to do.'</p> <h2>Funds</h2> <p><strong>Government gilts</strong> should be the ultimate safe haven as governments almost never default (though Iceland may prove to be an exception). But that does not mean it is impossible to lose money on gilts as, unless you buy at launch and hold to maturity, the price can fluctuate considerably. The global panic has sent the price of gilts soaring and the return on them tumbling. But most commentators think they may rise still further as interest rates across the world fall and inflationary pressures ease. Independent adviser Chelsea Financial Services recommends the City Financial Strategic Gilt fund, which has returned a respectable 4.8 per cent over the past year. </p> <p><strong>Corporate bonds</strong> should be safer than equities. They rank well up the pecking order of creditors, are often backed by real assets as security, carry a fixed interest rate and are independently rated by experts. But these are not normal times, as many bond investors are only too painfully aware. Not only are bondholders likely to lose much of their investment in banks such as Lehman Brothers, which collapsed, our own government actually rewrote the terms of Bradford &amp; Bingley's bonds to avoid having to pay out. The M&amp;G Strategic Corporate Bond fund has returned 2 per cent over the past year - not spectacular, but well ahead of the 7 per cent fall across the sector - while its 4.5 per cent three-year return compares with a 6.9 per cent fall in the sector.</p> <p><strong>Absolute return funds</strong> are designed to make money for investors, regardless of the markets. Too many of them have failed to do that and were losing money even before the recent gyrations. An exception is Blackrock's UK Absolute Alpha fund, managed by Mark Lyttleton, which had risen by 3 per cent in the nine months to September, compared with a 22 per cent fall in the FT All Share index, and it has continued to outperform the market during the chaos. </p> <p>Lyttleton did have a wobble during the summer when the fund fell in value, but no one can expect to make money all the time. While there was concern that he would be hit by the government ban on short-selling financial companies, his holdings in this sector were very small. </p> <p>He attempts to achieve steadier results through a combination of strategies; crucially, he uses derivatives, which are specialised products that allow investors to bet on the future price movement of an asset. 'This allows investors to make money when an asset is falling, as well as rising, in price,' says Darius McDermott of Chelsea Financial Services. </p> <p><strong>Income fund managers</strong> have had a dismal time lately. Until a year ago, banks were among the highest-yielding shares in the market, so accounted for a large proportion of most equity income funds. Now, not only has the income effectively disappeared - literally in the case of Bradford &amp; Bingley and Northern Rock, which were nationalised - their share prices have also plunged: HBOS's shares stand at little over a tenth of their year's high. That means that some income funds have lost as much as 40 per cent of their value over the past year. </p> <p>Neil Woodford, investment guru at Invesco Perpetual, has had no banks in his Income and Higher Income funds for years, nor does he invest in commodity companies, which were among the best performers until recent weeks. Yet he has still managed to top the performance tables over three and five years and has come in sixth over the past year, albeit with a 20 per cent fall in value. For those prepared to invest for the long term, his two funds, which are all but identical, should be a relatively safe bet. </p> <h2>Shares</h2> <p>Eventually we all need to have funerals and <strong>Dignity</strong> is Britain's largest provider of such services. While its shares have fallen a bit over the past year, it has beaten the market by 60 per cent over the past three years as profits have risen steadily. Analysts forecast a further 12 per cent growth this year and 10 per cent next, a rate that could look very healthy as the economy rapidly slows . While the dividend is relatively low - the yield is just 1.4 per cent - it has a record of special pay-outs: the next one could come as soon as 2010.</p> <p>When the stock market tumbled on 29 September, one company stood out as the only FTSE 100 component to gain in value: supermarket group <strong>Morrisons</strong>, which has been enjoying a revival as a new management team finally gets to grips with the business in the wake of the poorly executed takeover of Safeway. We all have to eat, and Morrisons is winning growing numbers of shoppers. </p> <p>You can hardly get a more basic commodity than water, and <strong>Pennon</strong> is one of our few remaining independently quoted suppliers, operating in the south west of England. The earnings from its regulated business are secure and Pennon also has an unregulated business, Viridor, which operates in the fast-growing waste management business. Predators have been sniffing around utilities, with British Energy the latest to fall victim to a takeover, and there has also been considerable bidding interest in waste management companies, which underpin Pennon's defensive attractions. Nick Rayner at the Share Centre says its dividend is 'not massive, but it is manageable', a valuable thing as more and more companies announce cuts.</p> <p>One of the most surprising victims of the stock market falls has been <strong>Vodafone</strong>, which has lost 40 per cent of its value over the past year. Yet telephone use should remain relatively stable. A series of generous dividend increases means Vodafone now has an extremely attractive 6 per cent yield, while its earnings are expected to grow by more than 5 per cent in each of the next two years. </p> <p>\u2022 Additional research by Huma Qureshi</p>",
  "<p>When they are staring into the abyss, people tend to step back, provided that the balance of their mind, or body, is not disturbed. </p> <p>With their sensational 'bail-out' (they prefer to call them 'rescue') packages, the US and UK bodies politic have stepped back from the brink. Huge amounts of concerted assistance to the money markets by the leading central banks, and that co-ordinated round of reductions in interest rates (including by the European Central Bank), have also been steps in the right direction. </p> <p>But the terrain that was rashly traversed en route to the abyss, and across which we must return, is still very rocky - indeed hazardous. Before the recent outburst of sanity among our economic policymakers, there was a growing danger that capitalism would seize up, and that comparisons with 1929-32 would seem less far-fetched. </p> <p>Thanks to the rescue operations, we may be warding off an economic depression, but still face recession; analogies with the 1970s, suitably adjusted, may not be inappropriate. </p> <p>The speed last week with which a leaked UK government/Bank of England \u00a350bn package of assistance to the banks and money markets was transformed into \u00a3500bn was mind-boggling - though the extent to which the taxpayer is exposed has been seriously exaggerated by alarmists. </p> <p>Nevertheless, this partial nationalisation of the banks is going to be temporarily expensive and nerve-racking, even if much of the 'contingency' money is never drawn upon, and even if, as the optimists hope, most of it is repaid. Whatever they say, it is difficult to believe that the taxpayer is going to end up in profit, given what is commonly called the 'toxic' nature of so many of the loans. </p> <p>Communism collapsed in the late 20th century, although 'market-communism' survives in China. But we now know that 21st-century Western capitalism cannot function unless it is underpinned by socialism, in the shape of vast injections of public funds.</p> <p>There has, understandably, been much criticism of the City bonus and distorted incentive structure, which combined with all that 'financial engineering' to produce the current mess. But many of the people now being rescued by the public sector were in the vanguard of those who believed in shrinking the state. To paraphrase Clement Attlee, a period of silence on their part would be welcome. </p> <p>As the financial phoenix arises from the ashes, the damage is such that it might not be an exaggeration to say that the bail-out means that taxpayers are lending money to bankers who will be very reluctant to lend it back to them. These were 'operators' who had the nerve to claim that their business was assessment of risk, but who inflicted this crisis on the rest of us through their bad decisions. </p> <p>Although attention in Britain during the past week has inevitably been focused on the reaction of the British government and the Bank of England, and although our own 'boom and bust' cycle is one of the contributing factors to the recession that seems to be upon us, the crisis is global financial cooling, as opposed to global warming. As the distinguished Italian economist and former Finance Minister Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa said last week: 'This is not a crisis within a system. This is a crisis of a system.' </p> <p>He was speaking at the launch at the London School of Economics of the English version of Fabrizio Saccomanni's book Managing International Financial Instability, the timing of whose publication could hardly be better. Saccomanni is director-general of the Bank of Italy, and the essence of the problem of international financial instability is epitomised in his subtitle 'National Tamers versus Global Tigers'. </p> <p>After the Great Crash of 1929, and subsequent Depression, capitalism was saved from the threat of communism by a combination of Keynesian economics and the post-war Bretton Woods system, which brought reasonable, rules-based international cooperation until the early 1970s. </p> <p>Saccomanni provides us with a superb history of all the crises since the 1970s, and how national policymakers (the 'tamers') have struggled with global markets (the 'tigers'). He puts recent events in context by pointing out that 'unsustainable increases in asset prices, followed by sharp declines, have been a recurrent feature of the operation of stock and real estate markets since the end of the Second World War, but that 'with the accelerating pace of financial globalisation during the 1980s, the magnitude and repercussions of the asset-prices boom-bust cycles have increased significantly... indeed the policies introduced by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan can be regarded as the \"displacement\" that set the stage for the tensions which have since reverberated across the global financial system and the world economy'. </p> <p>Saccomanni's message is that 'recurrent monetary and financial instability may foster protectionist tendencies lingering in both industrial and emerging countries'.</p> <p>Although the co-operative effort by central banks last week was a relief, we have seen some disturbing nationalistic and protectionist tendencies, not least in Europe. Padoa-Schioppa said last week that recent events constitute 'the sunset of the extreme view of naive belief that markets can function without regulation'. Saccomanni, also with a wealth of experience, believes the answer lies with 'institutionalised co-operation ... where the pursuit of a collective interest requires a co-operative act of intervention'.</p> <p>Is the present crisis sufficiently serious to offer such hope? Or are we in for protectionism and nationalism all over again? Time, surely, for the European Union to get its act together.</p>",
  "<p>It was the world's 20th biggest bank, with a significant presence in Britain. But this month Fortis became one of the largest European casualties of the financial turmoil when it was partly nationalised by the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg governments with a \u00a313bn cash injection.</p> <p>What did for Fortis, say analysts, was the huge number of sub-prime loans on its book. That, and the deal last year which saw it buy Dutch bank ABN Amro in partnership with the UK's Royal Bank of Scotland. In hindsight, that acquisition appears to have been a deal too far, sealed at the top of the market.</p> <p>But there may be other reasons for Fortis's demise that bring into focus fundamental questions about how the global banking crisis now threatening to destroy the world's economy was allowed to develop.</p> <p>Towards the end of Fortis's long and complicated annual accounts for 2007 is Note 47. It reveals a list of off-balance-sheet credit commitments adding up to \u20ac159.1bn. That is a serious amount of money. Fortis says the \u20ac159bn are loans that are generally on fixed terms and are offered on a case-by-case basis. And that's pretty much all the detail that is supplied. Many might well not find that sufficient.</p> <p>Then, on page 222 in the bank's accounts, is a list of 50 firms described as 'unconsolidated'. In other words, full details of those firms' liabilities and exposures do not appear on the bank's main accounts. There is no explanation about the health or status of these firms. The accounts state they are of small 'significance'. Not everyone is convinced.</p> <p>Fortis says the reason so many firms are unconsolidated is because the bank does not hold majority positions in these companies. This means, the bank argues, that it does not bear the main liability if a problem flares up. It is not necessary, therefore, to give out full details. Fortis believes its accounts represent a snapshot in time - an overview. They cannot be expected to reflect a full picture, and so quarterly statements fill in the gaps. </p> <p>Fortis's accounts were jointly audited by KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers - two of the big four practices. They have received audit fees running into tens of millions. But they seemingly failed to give investors an indication that Fortis was heading for severe problems. </p> <p>'The basis of an audit is the assessment of risk,' said forensic accountant Richard Murphy. 'These people, I believe, fundamentally failed to assess risk. They were responsible. That's what their job was. They didn't do it. We have to look at different audit systems for the future [and in the UK] the National Audit Office should now be protecting the taxpayers' investments in banks. We can't rely on the big four.'</p> <p>Auditors at Bradford &amp; Bingley, Northern Rock and a host of other institutions failed to sound the alarm over the significant risks in these businesses. </p> <p>KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers prefer not to discuss Fortis's case, though representatives say it is unfair to pin the blame for destruction of global firms solely on them. They argue that credit rating agencies who gave 'Triple A' assessments of sub-prime bonds, and regulators who failed to bear down on over-leveraged institutions, must also share responsibility. </p> <p>A senior figure within the accountancy profession said that it was clear to anyone who had wanted to assess Northern Rock's accounts that two thirds of its funding had to be refreshed on a short-term basis. 'The liquidity risk was evident,' he said. 'It's just that most people thought they could sell paper.'</p> <p>Other experienced financiers disagree. Jon Moulton told The Observer earlier this year that although he is a sophisticated assessor of balance sheets it took him two hours to get his head round Northern Rock's accounts. </p> <p>Insiders at the International Accounting Standards Board admit that the credit crisis has 'obviously tested standards', and reform is in the air. However, many in the financial community still maintain worryingly that 'markets are self-correcting'. </p> <p>So far, reform has been painfully slow. The Financial Stability Forum in April last year made 67 recommendations for major banking and regulatory reform: three were related to financial reporting. They concerned off-balance-sheet accounting, disclosure and the fair valuation of assets.</p> <p>Accountants say people charged with reform are independent of the profession, but that may be pushing it. While some of the top brass governing accountancy are academics and from the legal profession, the remainder tend to come from the higher echelons of the financial services sector. These will be the people who devise new rules in the post-crash financial world. Are they sufficiently independent to devise a better framework?</p>",
  "<p>I decided to start playing the piano at the age of three after seeing Tom and Jerry on TV. My father taught me initially. When you're learning, I think it's incredibly important to get a second opinion from someone who knows and understands you. Playing the piano can be like looking in the mirror: you become very self-absorbed and it's important to have somebody you trust observing you.</p> <p>I sometimes find classical music difficult to access. You just have to take your time and listen carefully. If you get frustrated, do something different - find a new piece of music or change activities, then come back to the piano. I practise for two to three hours every day. One day away from the piano is fine, but after two days, I start to feel strange. </p> <p>The first song I learned to play was by Mozart. The notes weren't that difficult and it was a joy when I performed it for the first time. For me, performing feels as natural as conversation.</p> <p>At this year's BBC Proms I performed Chopin, so Chopin has recently become a big part of my life. Last year, it was Beethoven. Each year I have a different focus - it's like finding a new favourite dish every year. Life would be boring if you always ate the same dish ...</p> <p>My name means \"brilliant man\" and that's what I try to work towards. I really go for it in every concert. The important thing is to learn something from each performance.</p> <p>The Beijing Olympics was no normal recital. I played to a global audience of four billion people. Next year, I will be in residency at the Barbican with the London Symphony Orchestra, playing six shows including an educational concert with 100 schoolchildren. We've already given them homework to do - they're learning Schubert's Military March.</p> <p>My hope is that I can introduce more young people to classical music. If I can help inspire more kids to take up the instrument, that's the best I can do. </p> <p>\u2022 Lang Lang is a global brand ambassador for Montblanc and chairman of the Montblanc Cultural Foundation, which supports art and cultural initiatives around the world</p>",
  "<p>Amid all the reckless gambling of recent years, British banks did make one sound bet: they guessed that they were so vital to the economy that politicians would never let them fail. </p> <p>Sure enough, as crunch turned to crisis and crisis turned to panic, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor last week announced a rescue package of breathtaking scale: \u00a350bn to rebuild banks' capital stores; at least \u00a3200bn of cash available through the Bank of England's 'special liquidity scheme'; a guarantee worth \u00a3250bn of further borrowing by banks on wholesale money markets. </p> <p>It was the right thing to do. Since the economy depends on a flow of capital from banks to businesses and households, and because mutual distrust has stopped banks lending to each other, it falls to governments to put money back into the system.</p> <p>While the US Treasury was faster to act in a manner appropriate to the scale of the crisis, the British response is smarter. The American plan, worth $700bn, was essentially to purchase toxic debt from failing banks - turning the taxpayer into the buyer of last resort for assets that the market had rejected. The UK approach puts money closer to the heart of the problem, pouring capital directly on to bank balance sheets and taking part ownership in return. Instead of bailing water out of the leaky vessel, Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown are trying to plug the leak. </p> <p>Given the global nature of the crisis, the British initiative will only work if the rest of the world follows suit. Henry Paulson, US Treasury Secretary, said last week that he was prepared to do just that. The US government may now invest directly in the nation's banks for the first time since the 1930s. </p> <p>European governments have been less ambitious, some because they prefer to deal with bank failures on an ad hoc basis, and some because they doubt the crisis will hit them as hard as it has the 'Anglo-Saxons'. They are mistaken. No financial institution is safe. Only a systemic rescue will stabilise the situation. Politicians cannot wait for the market to signal trouble and then react; they must wrest control of the economy away from panic-stricken markets. </p> <p>But bankers resist government involvement in their affairs with something like religious zealotry and the Brown-Darling rescue plan contains no clear strategy for bringing them to heel. The Prime Minister said that public investment will come 'with strings attached', but added that the detail would be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. </p> <p>It is asking too much of taxpayers to put their money up front without explaining what they will get in return. Some concessions should be non-negotiable. </p> <p>First, the banks should accept the presence of a government official or civil servant on their boards of directors and remunerations committees. The banks will need constant reminding that they owe their survival to public money and that they should start running their businesses with more respect for the public interest. </p> <p>Second, the banks should not treat the government's equity stake like a simple loan. They cannot expect that, when the current crisis has passed, government will step back from its investment without extracting a profit. Having part-nationalised the banks, the state must manage its shareholding to yield the best return for the taxpayer. </p> <p>Third, the banks must not hoard their new capital. The rescue is only justified if it brings liquidity back to the economy. That means lending on the High Street again. </p> <p>That is the minimum required to make the package palatable to voters. It would be a fair exchange for government ramping up the national debt, blasting a hole in its spending plans and facing down public rage at the sight of rich financiers piling into state-sponsored lifeboats while everyone else must swim through the coming recession or sink in it.</p> <p>Having stabilised the banking sector, the government will have to embark on wider reform of the City. It must make financial services more transparent, more accountable and subservient to the wider economy.</p> <p>That means, for example, curtailing the anonymous trade in complex securities and derivatives. Those arcane instruments are at the heart of the current crisis because they were used to disguise liability for debt defaults - spreading hidden risk across the global system. If they are to survive at all, they should be swapped on a regulated exchange, where traders are identifiable and their accounts open to scrutiny. </p> <p>The rating agencies, which failed to identify how risky many widely traded assets were, must also be reformed. The conflict of interest whereby the agencies take fees from the banks whose investments they are supposed to analyse must be addressed.</p> <p>The banks must separate their investment and retail arms. They must decide whether they want to be taking deposits and lending to customers or managing funds and speculating on financial markets. They must also be forced to maintain healthy ratios of capital to debt - storing cash during a boom so they can lend in a downturn. </p> <p>None of that can be achieved without the banks' co-operation. But there seems little prospect of that when the bankers are not showing any remorse. While politicians are accountable at the ballot box, the bankers face no equivalent public judgment. While the Chancellor and the Prime Minister take to the airwaves to defend their actions, City bosses have gone to ground. Not one executive has owned up to presiding over a catastrophe, apologised and resigned. No bankers have put themselves in a public forum to explain, for example, why they deserved to be paid multimillion pound bonuses for decisions that led to the biggest economic crisis in living memory, or what drove them to make those decisions, if not arrogance and greed. </p> <p>If the bankers will not volunteer to give an account of themselves, they must be compelled to do so before a public inquiry. It will take a forensic examination of how this crisis came about to design a regulatory system to prevent it being repeated. It will also take some show of contrition by bankers before public confidence and trust in the financial system can be restored. </p> <p>For a generation, politicians have taken orders from the City, creating tax breaks and cutting regulation lest the captains of global finance flee to softer jurisdictions abroad. Some bankers think their power will not diminish. Some have even complained that the government was not quick enough to respond to their needs, that Mr Brown and Mr Darling 'dithered'. That cry for help marks an abrupt change in tone from the old demands for freedom from interference.</p> <p>The City seems to believe it can turn to the state for aid in a crisis and the return to business as usual. Wrong. The bankers also seem to think they enjoy indefinite protection by the dwindling band of politicians, mostly Conservatives, who still opine on the benefits of deregulation and gigantic pay incentives for the City. Wrong again.</p> <p>With \u00a3500bn of taxpayers' money keeping them afloat, the banks are in no position to be giving orders, nor to be paying themselves exorbitant sums. With public money must come public accountability. The banks thought they were too big for politicians to let them fail and they were right. But if voters get no explanation and nothing in return for their money, their fury will be too great for politicians to ignore.</p>",
  "<p>And now, the best bit of the year. The vegetable patch stands in the roasted-spice colours of late autumn; orange-skinned onion squashes glow among the blackened skeletons of blighted tomato plants; plumes of crinkled cavolo nero poke through the tangled remains of last season's climbing beans. This is the point in the year when I enjoy working outside more than any other. Today the work itself is seasoned with the smell of a thick bean soup seeping warm-heartedly out of the kitchen door. </p> <p>Britain has plenty of lumpy soups in its repertoire - mulligatawny; the smoked-haddock-rich Cullen Skink; pea and ham; Scotch broth - but none of them contains the beans prevalent in the national soup-stews of Italy and Spain which I hanker after at this time of year. Neither are any of ours a showcase for late-autumn vegetables, such as squash and dark cabbage. Beans pad out the aromatics, bring in some body and soul, and turn a broth into a main course. But which beans are best for soup?</p> <p>Any shape of dried bean will introduce structure and sustenance. The flatter the bean the more it is likely to break up during cooking. This is no bad thing, as it brings a pleasing sauce-like slushiness into play. As the beans disintegrate into the stock and aromatics they do the thickening for you. I like the flat, mealy-textured varieties in my soups. Butter beans and broad beans collapse to a floury, almost velvety texture if you crush a few of them into the soup with a fork, and lend a soft, mellow flavour. I use plenty of garlic with them to make them feel at home. Labelling, incidentally, can be confusing: fava are simply broad beans; lima beans are butter beans (and one of the few varieties that do not need an overnight soaking). </p> <p>The kidney-shaped beans that are rounded rather than flat tend to keep their shape (though the more refined flageolet is the most tender). That's fine, but they can give a different, strangely less satisfying soup altogether. Speckled borlotti, white cannelloni, green flageolet and the gold and white palomino beans are suitable candidates. Soak them overnight as you would any other, discard the soaking water, and give them a spirited boil in clean, unsalted water. Forget the red kidney bean. Like the soy, it seems to lack the ability to soak up any flavours. Whatever you do with it, the red kidney remains a hard, indigestible little pebble that should have been left in the Sixties.</p> <p>Short of time, there is every reason to open a can of beans, drain them and stir them into the almost-finished soup. I do this countless times throughout the year. But right now, in autumn's golden light, I want none of that instant gratification. I want a slow supper - not quite soup, not quite stew - cooked from scratch, whose soul-warming smells stir me and mine in from sweeping the leaves and toward the kitchen. </p> <h2>A soup-stew of squash and cabbage</h2> <p>A knuckle end of Parma ham would be a sound addition here if your local deli will sell you one. Serves 4-6.</p> <p><strong>250g dried beans</strong><br><strong>2 bay leaves</strong><br><strong>olive oil</strong><br><strong>150g pancetta in the piece</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong><br><strong>2 large onions</strong><br><strong>a thick slice of butter</strong><br><strong>2 carrots</strong><br><strong>2 large cloves garlic, peeled and chopped</strong><br><strong>400g roughly chopped tomatoes</strong><br><strong>1 litre water or vegetable stock</strong><br><strong>1 small butternut squash or small pumpkin</strong><br><strong>a short length of crust from a lump of Parmesan</strong><br><strong>a handful of flat-leafed parsley</strong><br><strong>2 large handfuls of cavolo nero or \u00bd a small cabbage, cut into wedges</strong></p> <p>Soak the beans overnight in deep, cold water. Drain, tip them into a large, deep saucepan and cover them with fresh water. Bring them to the boil then remove the froth that comes to the surface with a draining spoon. Drop in the bay leaves, a tablespoon or so of olive oil, then leave to boil merrily for 45-60 minutes or so, until the beans are tender. (Older beans take a bit longer.) Add salt about 20 minutes before the end of cooking. Drain and set aside. (I sometimes put a shot of olive oil over them at this point to prevent them from sticking together.)</p> <p>To make the soup: cut the pancetta into short lengths or fat cubes and put them in a deep pan with a couple of spoonfuls of oil and set over a moderate heat. Peel the onions, halve them and slice them thinly. Once the butter melts and the pancetta has begun to sizzle, add the onions and stir them from time to time until they soften. </p> <p>Scrub the carrots, cut them into large dice, then add them to the onion with the garlic. Let everything soften without colouring, lowering the heat as you need to. Add the tomatoes, then let them soften and melt a little into the other vegetables before pouring in the water. Peel and roughly chop the squash or pumpkin and stir in. </p> <p>Now add the piece of Parma ham bone, if you have one, and the Parmesan rind. Bring the soup almost to the boil then turn down the heat so the soup gently simmers. Cover with a lid, but set it askew, so that some of the steam escapes. Leave to simmer, with only the occasional stir, for an hour and a half - the soup should be thick, rich and heavy. </p> <p>Add the beans to the pot along with the parsley, roughly chopped, and the cabbage leaves. Continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes. Serve with grated Parmesan.</p> <h2>Little fig and blackberry pies</h2> <p>Here is the softest pastry for the juiciest of fruit pies. Don't be tempted to roll it too thinly. Cut the pastry into four then pat each out lightly, pushing it into the corners of the baking tins. Spoon in the filling, then fold the pastry lightly over the top. You will need 4 deep tartlet tins about 9cm x 4cm. Makes 4.</p> <p><strong>for the pastry:</strong><br><strong>140g butter</strong><br><strong>230g plain flour</strong><br><strong>50g icing sugar</strong><br><strong>1 large egg yolk</strong><br><strong>for the filling:</strong><br><strong>250g blackberries</strong><br><strong>4 large figs</strong><br><strong>4 tbsp redcurrant jelly, melted</strong><br><strong>juice of \u00bd a lemon</strong><br><strong>60g ground hazelnuts</strong><br><strong>a little icing sugar</strong></p> <p>Rub the butter into the flour with your fingertips, then mix in the icing sugar and the yolk. Bring the dough together and squeeze into a round, then roll into a short fat log before putting in the fridge for half an hour to chill. I find this pastry works well in the food processor, too - first blitz the flour and butter, then mix briefly with the sugar and egg yolk. </p> <p>Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Rinse the blackberries, roughly chop the figs, and toss with the melted redcurrant jelly, lemon juice and ground hazelnuts. </p> <p>Cut the pastry into four. Flatten each piece on a floured board and use to line the tart tins. Leave any pastry overhanging the edges. Pile the filling into the tart cases, then loosely fold over any overhanging pastry. It should not meet in the centre, but instead leave a gap through which the fruit is visible. </p> <p>Place the tarts on a baking sheet and bake for 30-35 minutes or so, till the pastry is dark biscuit-coloured and the fruit bubbling.

  "<p>New figures showing a rise in the number of domestic cats contracting bovine tuberculosis have prompted claims the disease is out of control.</p> <p>Details released by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs show that 42 cats were confirmed with bovine TB between 2005 and 2007 compared with 15 over the previous seven years. The National Farmers' Union said it was a 'worrying trend' indicating the relentless rise in infection in cattle and badgers. 'It's just the tip of the iceberg,' said Catherine McLaughlin, the union's animal health and welfare adviser. 'Given that these cases were only identified through post mortems or clinical intervention, it suggests far greater levels of transmission than we have previously seen.'</p> <p>The Badger Trust dismissed the claims as 'scaremongering', while Defra attributed the rise to increased reporting since TB in cats became a notifiable disease 18 months ago. The Defra figures, released to the NFU under the Freedom of Information Act, show that the M. bovis strain was also found in 21 pigs and farmed wild boar, 25 llamas, five alpacas, three ferrets, two sheep, two goats and one dog during the same period. McLaughlin said it was not known if the domestic animals were infected through cattle or badgers, but the fact that infected cattle were immediately slaughtered and therefore 'less infectious' meant the culprit was 'more likely' to be badgers. 'The last thing we want to do is cause panic, but this needs to be taken seriously. And at the moment it is being treated irresponsibly by the government.'</p> <p>Environment Secretary Hilary Benn has ruled out a badger cull in England, in case patchy culling makes the spread of the disease worse. A government response to the Defra committee inquiry into badger culling published last week also acknowledged the likelihood of 'public order problems' jeopardising any cull.</p> <p>Defra figures confirm a 26 per cent rise in bTB in cattle in England this year, with 20,055 animals slaughtered between January and June.</p>",

But if that's the price of protest, I find myself in a very difficult position.'</p> <p>Omond is the founder of Climate Rush, the group behind tomorrow's demonstration in Parliament Square that will call for an end to airport expansion and tougher measures to control carbon dioxide emissions. It is a case in which she passionately believes: last February she was one of the so-called 'Commons Five' whose faces flashed across news programmes throughout the world when they scaled the Houses of Parliament to protest against a third runway at Heathrow.</p> <p>The group stayed on the roof for three hours: a period carefully timed to coincide with Gordon Brown's arrival for Prime Minister's questions, during which at least one MP was to ask questions about the anti-aviation debate. Brown cancelled at the last minute - Omond is not sure whether his non-appearance was linked to the protest - and the group descended from the rooftops to be met by police who arrested them on charges of trespass. The group were kept in custody for 12 hours before being released on bail to await their trial on 11 November, at which they could receive a maximum penalty of 51 weeks' custody and a \u00a35,000 fine.</p> <p>But if the idea of a year's incarceration makes her feel queasy, it is the bail conditions that are causing her immediate concern. 'If I go into the Houses of Parliament or break the law before the court case, I will be held on remand,' she admitted. 'Part of me doesn't want this life at all. But if you look back at history, the world has been changed by people with the courage to fight for the right thing at a time when that thing was being completely ignored. This is exactly the position we're in now.</p> <p>'What I find most shattering is this amazing discrepancy between what is scientifically proven and what the public are being told,' she added. 'Time is fast running out to stop irreversible climate change. Global warming experts agree that we have only 100 months to avoid disaster, and yet we're in this ridiculous situation where the public are saying climate change can't be that bad, otherwise the government would do something. And the government is saying it is that bad, but we can't do something because the public's not ready for it.'</p> <p>It was this Alice in Wonderland world that, five years ago, shunted Omond on to the path she is now hurtling down. 'I was in my final year at Cambridge and had my life planned out: I was going to go into marketing and get a nice job in the City. Then one day, instead of reading King Lear for the eighth time, I picked up some climate change research and found I couldn't put it down.'</p> <p>In the year after graduating from Cambridge with a first-class honours degree in English, Omond continued her environmental research. 'I became completely convinced by the evidence that we only have a really limited time to make a large social change,' she said. 'I realised that direct action was the only way to raise public consciousness to a point where those changes could be made.'</p> <p>Omond had never attended a protest but she took to grassroots campaigning like a duck to water; helping co-ordinate carnival marches, protest camps, lock-on's (attaching herself to buildings and gates with locks) and banner-drops. In December 2007, she became London co-ordinator for the environmental network Plane Stupid, organising protests at corporate offices, high-street travel agents and local airports.</p> <p>Last July, she was one of the group who blasted aircraft noise through the letterbox of the then Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly's Docklands apartment at 7.30am - leaving peacefully, albeit pursued by Kelly's husband, Derek Gadd.</p> <p>Shortly after Omond left Cambridge, she had decided she wanted to become a priest. Already a church administrator, she asked her vicar to initiate conversations with the local bishop about beginning her training. It is, she now admits, a dream she might never realise.</p> <p>'I would love to return to training for the priesthood, but this whole period of me breaking the law might mean that they don't want me any more,' she said. 'I desperately want to be a priest, but I don't have the time to commit myself to the Church and to activism at the same time. I had to pick one and, at the moment, my environmental action is more important.'</p> <p>Tomorrow afternoon, Omond will gather together her banners, handouts, high-visibility jackets - and her revision notes - and head off to sit her MA. It is a three-hour examination but she has to finish it in two hours if she is to reach Parliament Square by 5.30pm and catch the impressive list of speakers who support the cause: Rosie Boycott will be followed by, among others, Sam Roddick and Baroness Tonge.</p> <p>The line-up concludes at 6.30pm with a speech from Omond herself. And then there will be an hour left to protest in the best way the group know.</p>",
  "<p>The global slump in share prices will lead to companies being forced to top up defined benefit or final salary pension schemes to the tune of tens of millions of pounds, according to accountancy firm Deloitte.</p> <p>Pensions partner Paul Geeson says that the stockmarket collapse of recent weeks means that the trustees of pension funds will be demanding extra payments as share values plummet. 'Even though many funds are still in surplus when measured by standard accounting norms, trustees will want additional security to protect the interests of scheme members.'</p> <p>One reason that funds are in surplus is that they are heavily invested in bonds and less exposed to equities than seven or eight years ago. Bond yields are exceptionally high at the moment, says Geeson.</p> <p>Contributing members of schemes could also be asked to make additional contributions, but in many cases there are too few existing employees to make a big difference and so a disproportionate amount would fall to employers.</p> <p>Watson Wyatt, the actuarial firm and financial consultants, estimates that FTSE 100 final salary schemes have seen their surpluses more or less halved to \u00a315bn since the summer.</p> <p>In the world of defined contribution pensions - where there is no guaranteed level of benefit, increasingly the norm in the UK - annuity providers have been inundated with calls from people close to their retirement date asking for a delay. </p> <p>The collapse in the global stock market means that the value of many people's defined contributions pensions has slumped by 20-40 per cent. Those not due to retire for some years should see the value of their portfolio recover. But those retiring soon will be forced to live on much lower pay-outs than expected. </p> <p>Independent pensions adviser Ros Altmann says annuity providers can levy a penalty, typically 10 per cent of the total value of the investment portfolio, for those who change their pre-arranged retirement date. They argue that they need the notice - usually given several months in advance of retirement - in order to plan their investment strategy. </p> <p>Altmann says the government should force companies to waive this penalty. 'People close to retirement age are in trouble. If you are a few months away from retirement, it's too late, it's all set.'</p> <p>New research from Payplan, financial advisors who specialise in debt, show that people in their fifties - 'pre-retirees' - are becoming increasingly indebted, which will force many to delay their retirement. The average debt of people in this age group now stands at \u00a341,400, which is 25 per cent higher than the average unsecured debts of younger age groups (\u00a332,700). The survey of 40,000 Payplan clients also showed that it takes longer for those in their fifties to pay off their debts.</p>",
  "<p>Energy-intensive industries are set to receive a huge cash boost from the European Commission as part of a controversial move to protect Europe's industrial sector from world recession.</p> <p>Within weeks the EU is to debate whether to allow European industrial giants tens of millions of pounds off carbon allowances they have to buy as part of the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS).</p> <p>G\u00fcnter Verheugen, European Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry, in an exclusive interview with The Observer, said the move will prevent hundreds of thousands of job losses in the EU industrial sector amid the worst economic conditions for decades.</p> <p>Verheugen said European industrial powerhouses are refusing to invest in new plants and businesses in the eurozone because they claim 'compliance costs' caused by the emission trading scheme make new ventures too costly. Verheugen fears a huge surge in unemployment if the world's financial crisis escalates. </p> <p>The move will provoke opposition from green groups who will interpret the measure as a signal that Europe is putting economic concerns above environmental imperatives.</p> <p>Verheugen countered by saying that the allowance would be restricted to firms which invested in the most modern 'sustainable' technologies. They would, however, see a significant reduction in carbon credits, which would wipe millions of pounds off their cost base.</p> <p>Verheugen's proposals could be rushed through by the commission as fears grow over unemployment, which averages 7.5 per cent across the 27 EU states.</p> <p>'I don't want to change the EU's environmental objectives because I believe that's economically healthy,' said Verheugen, who is close to Peter Mandelson, the former EU Trade Commissioner and current UK business secretary. </p> <p>'Doing nothing on the environment will cost more than taking action ... [But] it makes no sense to force certain industries to leave Europe. They will take jobs and their pollution. As a result, there will be more pollution in the world and we will have fewer jobs. Deindustrialisation does not solve environmental problems.'</p> <p>The news will delight some of Europe's biggest companies, including French giant La Farge and the British cement industry, which has lobbied strongly for this measure.</p> <p>The ETS is the largest emissions trading scheme in the world and is a pillar of EU climate policy. It covers more than 10,000 installations in the energy and industrial sectors, collectively responsible for close to half of the EU's emissions of carbon dioxide and 40 per cent of its total greenhouse gas emissions.</p>",
  "<p>The chancellor must take emergency steps to prevent rail, water and power companies going bust in the global economic storm, former cabinet minister Peter Hain has warned. </p> <p>Hain, the former work and pensions secretary, urged the government to draw up reserve powers that could be used in the event of a major utility collapsing and taking vital services with it. His words follow jitters in the City about the damage a freeze in bank lending could do to some companies that have borrowed heavily to invest in infrastructure.</p> <p>'We need to have a plan B in advance rather than playing catch-up. This is such a serious situation globally that having led the way, as the Prime Minister did worldwide in the rescue package for finance, we now need to put in place measures which could rescue vital infrastructure which can't be allowed to fail,' Hain told The Observer</p> <p>'We may be in an area where simply for survival and resolution of this crisis there has to be much closer government intervention, way beyond the banks.'</p> <p>He said it was 'moonshine' to think that the railways or private utilities could be re-nationalised but the government needed a contingency plan to re-capitalise critical services if necessary, just as it did last week by offering to buy shares in banks.</p> <p>Currently, if a train operator goes bust, the government is required to step in and run services until a replacement can be found. </p> <p>Jim Steer, a transport analyst and former director of the Strategic Rail Authority, has warned that if passenger numbers fall sharply a number of train operators are running on such tight margins that they might need to be bailed out. </p> <p>Louise Ellman, chair of the Commons transport select committee, said the franchises as now worded left the government too exposed to picking up the pieces if an operator did go bust.</p> <p>'That is one of the weaknesses of the current system, that it does depend on the operator continuing. The government would have to step into the breach if [one went bust]. You couldn't have a collapse of the public transport system.'</p> <p>The Department for Transport said it had powers under the Railways Act to intervene.</p>",
  "<p>The G7 club of rich nations was this weekend facing up to a seismic shift in the global economy, as the International Monetary Fund predicted that emerging markets would soon be sitting on $6.5 trillion of foreign currency reserves.</p> <p>After Wall Street suffered its worst ever week, and more than a fifth was wiped off the value of companies in all the major European markets in just five days, finance ministers and central bankers gathered in Washington for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund were painfully aware of their diminished power.</p> <p>Iceland, where a banking crisis is threatening the solvency of the government, turned first to Russia for a $4bn loan, instead of calling on the IMF. Moscow has said there are no strings attached to the funds, but many analysts see Russia as trying to extend its geopolitical power.</p> <p>Graham Turner, of GFC Economics, said it would not be surprising to see China, too, bailing out governments in the months ahead. 'It's the perfect opportunity for them to demonstrate their hegemony,' he said. The IMF believes that up to 30 countries are at severe risk of facing a government budget crisis because of the combination of the credit crunch and volatile commodity prices.</p> <p>IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn has said he has a $200bn war chest to make loans to struggling governments, but the lender's resources are dwarfed by the cash piles held by governments in China, Russia and the Middle East. Battered banks in G7 countries and governments hit by debt crises may have little choice but to appeal to these new powerbrokers in the coming years. </p> <p>In its half-yearly health check of the global economy, the IMF predicted that the reserves held by China, Russia and other emerging markets would surge from $4.7 trillion last year to $6.5 trillion by the end of 2009. It also emerged this weekend that the Treasury hopes rapidly to offload the stakes it is buying in Britain's banks, once calm is restored; and is likely to look to cash-rich sovereign wealth funds as potential investors.</p> <p>Turner added that the very reason many of these countries have accumulated huge surpluses was to avoid having to go cap in hand to the IMF as they did during the Asian financial crisis a decade ago, and accept stringent policy conditions in exchange. 'They said, \"We will never go there again.\" '</p>",

  "<p>When they are on stage Amadou and Mariam never leave each other's side; they stand as close as they can to each other, to the extent that their extraordinary music seems to come from a single shared place. They do something like the same thing on their sofa in the front room of their bare-walled Parisian flat; Mariam constantly checking her husband's proximity as they talk, he reassuring her with his touch. Their relationship is among the longest running love songs ever written. </p> <p>Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia first heard each other making music at the Institute for the Blind in Bamako, the capital of Mali, back in 1976. They have never stopped listening. Mariam was the student with the mesmerising voice, mournful and effervescent by turns - she had been performing at weddings and funerals since she was 10. Amadou was her young music teacher, a finger-picking genius on the guitar, member of Mali's most famous band, Les Ambassadeurs. Neither of them had been born blind and, having lost their sight - she aged five, he aged 15 - they had not imagined subsequently falling in love with anything but their music. As they sit on their sofa and explain how this proved not to be the case, how what happened between them was their very particular version of 'love at first sight' they cannot stop smiling, as if, three decades on, they still can't believe their luck.</p> <p>If you have been fortunate enough to hear Amadou and Mariam's last album, Dimanche a Bamako, which came out a couple of years ago, you would understand exactly this sense of providential joy. It is the emotion that carries a good deal of their music, and one that in early 2005 brought a sudden sense of the lazy Sunday afternoons of a Malian summer into a Parisian winter - the album sold more than half a million copies in France alone. Produced by the midas-touch Manu Chao it also walked off with the prestigious French Victoire de la Musique award and was Album of the Year and Best African Album in the Radio 3 Awards for World Music. So, with a new album out next month, the equally life-affirming but increasingly ambitious Welcome to Mali, we talk first about the obvious thing, how hard an act has that breakthrough album been to follow?</p> <p>It wasn't so hard, they suggest, in their native French; 'having waited a long time for it, success is the easiest thing in the world,' the 54-year-old Amadou says, laughing behind big silver-framed shades. There is no pressure except the usual pressure to come up with new melodies, new sounds. 'The feeling of that album was still very strong, and we had some good songs and good people to work with, so it was simple enough.' One of those collaborators was Damon Albarn, who has produced the opening track on Welcome To Mali, the hypnotic 'Sabali', which sounds like nothing you have ever heard - ethereal Malian wonder meets savvy Britpop keyboards. Albarn exploits the 50-year-old Mariam's voice to great effect - she has the ability to give even the catchiest pop tune a hint of otherworldy sadness. On 'Sabali' she sings breathily of hard-won wisdom - and it comes as no great surprise to learn that the wisdom in question is the sense that 'avec toi, cherie, la vie est belle.'</p> <p>Albarn had been 'brilliantly curious' to work with, Amadou - who does nearly all of the talking - says, in the sense that he 'was always trying to find something new from us'. Albarn had seen them play at a music festival in Timbuktu, and they later met in Brixton, where Amadou and Mariam became involved with African Express, the roving musical party that aims to bring the best African bands in contact with new audiences - in part a response to Bob Geldof's strange notion at Live 8 that a concert for Africa should not necessarily include any African musicians because a global audience would find it hard to relate to them.</p> <p>Amadou and Mariam are living proof of the absurdity of that idea. They resist the label 'world music' to describe what they do, preferring to call it 'music from and for the world'. The more you listen to Welcome to Mali, the more you hear the force of that idea - there are little refrains from everywhere you have ever been wrapped up in it. Amadou puts this down to his obsessive radio habit. Wherever he is on tour he will have a radio clamped to his ear, scanning for whatever is local and new. This habit began for him in the Sixties and Seventies when he was perhaps the only Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd fan in Bamako. While his friends were listening to Guinean dance music, or Cuban imports, he was adding Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page riffs to his traditional Malian technique. Two of his uncles, he says, were professional guitar players, one in a band, the other playing 'music for hunters', but neither of them sounded a bit like him.</p> <p>It was this distinctive electric sound that gave a young music producer called Marc-Antoine Moreau pause when he first heard Amadou and Mariam in 1990. Moreau, the couple's long-term manager and producer, explains what sounds very much like the workings of fate. He was on a tour of west Africa in search of bands and one afternoon on a whim he took a train from Dakar to Abidjan. Having bought a few CDs at random in a record shop he was listening to Amadou and Mariam at a bus stop. A woman came up to him and said, 'That record is by my sister'. Yes, Moreau thought at first, in Africa we are all brothers and sisters. But no, she insisted, it was actually her sister. Moreau told her who he was and to pass on his regards, but though he kept the music in his head, he did not follow up the contact. In 1994 he heard that Amadou and Mariam were playing at a small gig in Paris. He went along and when he introdced himself after the show he was greeted, in a Stanley and Livingstone kind of moment, with the words: 'Ah, you are the guy from the bus stop.' 'Amadou is like that,' Moreau says, 'he is a magical kind of guy. Things happen to him.'</p> <p>In Amadou's own telling it was only a matter of time before someone like Moreau had come along to recognise their music. 'If you have optimism and courage, then you can make your own destiny,' he says; the harder they worked at their music the luckier they got. 'The big difference with them and any other artist we know from Mali, the great Salif Keita, for example,' says Moreau, 'is that they are genuine pop artists, they create pop songs naturally.' While Amadou was listening to Pink Floyd on his radio in the Seventies, Mariam had a compulsive affection for French pop tunes. 'The result, added to their traditional Malian musical background could sound like African electric blues,' Moreau suggests, 'but it is not that at all.' This resistance to definition is reflected in their audience. Though they sing in French when they play in America they have black mamas getting down and hearing Africa, and white Texan rednecks dancing alongside them hearing rock and roll. In England, at the O2 last summer, the duo supported pan-sexual disco sensations the Scissor Sisters.</p> <p>The sound, nearly always upbeat, carries somewhere in it all of the struggle that Amadou and Mariam have had to get here. These days in the Malian suburb of Paris where they have a flat, Montreuil (known as Mali's second city), and beyond, they can't walk down the street without being mobbed, but when they first came to the French capital at Moreau's suggestion in 1996 to make a studio album they could not get visas, had to play cat and mouse with the immigration authorities in order to get the record made.</p> <p>That kind of battle, and the stubborn good humour required to overcome it was nothing new though. And it was nothing at all compared with the difficulties they had as a blind couple with three young children in Bamako trying to get a music career off the ground. Their relationship itself had initially met with resistance from some parts of their families who thought that two blind people together could never work. Having achieved some local success with a group from the blind institute in Bamako, Amadou and Mariam decided to prove the doubters wrong by going to the Ivory Coast, to make a name for themselves.</p> <p>It did not work out exactly as they had hoped. They were billed for a couple of years, reductively, as 'The Blind Couple from Mali' and were in danger of being a novelty act. 'It was complicated,' Amadou recalls. 'We were certainly from Mali and we were certainly blind, and you should remember that being blind in Africa is not quite as unusual as being blind in the West, there is less stigma. But even so, we did not think that was all we were about.'</p> <p>Did they draw strength as a couple from their determination to overcome that billing?</p> <p>Amadou thinks for a moment. 'The music itself gave us the strength to overcome the blindness, so you cannot separate the two,' he says. 'We were musicians first, blind second,' Mariam suggests.</p> <p>I wonder if they look at their lives as a before and after - do they think of the time when they could see as a different kind of life?</p> <p>Mariam does to a degree, Amadou is less sure. 'I used to be able to see, then I could see less, finally I could see not at all,' he says. 'It did not seem a different life. And when I did become blind, there were plenty of examples of blind musicians I could find inspiration from. Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, I listened hard to what they had done.'</p> <p>The portrait they present of their homeland in songs sounds like a remembered paradise, where Sundays are for weddings, and every day is a carnival ('I'll be the most beautiful, the prettiest girl there for you, my love, at the village fete!' they sing on 'La fete au village'). They now live six months of the year in Paris - partly with their son, Sam, who has a recording deal with his own group, SMOD (and whose debut album, also produced by Manu Chao, will appear next year) - but Bamako is still home. When they are there they work as much as they can with the Blind Institute, hosting a fund raising concert each year at which some of Africa's biggest names perform, in order to keep things running.</p> <p>When they go back these days, though, it is with a sense of some of their dreams fulfilled. There have been many magical nights; a few stand out in their memory. There was the time at the Trance festival in Rennes, when they had just started out in France and no one really knew them but with their first song the whole place came alive. And in Rio more recently, when they played in the round at the Maracana Stadium and as they took the stage a Mexican wave rippled through the crowd. Amadou and Mariam could only stand in the middle together, holding each other, and wonder what this strange turbulent motion of sound was. And then there was Glastonbury last year: 'I had thought mud like that only existed in Mali during the rains,' Amadou says, 'but it was home away from home.'</p> <p>In all of this Amadou and Mariam are in danger of giving musical marriages - notoriously volatile - a good name. A highlight of their shows is their distinctively Malian version of 'Je t'aime', which is rendered as 'M'Bife'. Unlike Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, however, still Paris's other favourite couple, they have stayed together. </p> <p>I wonder about the secret of this love story. 'I am interested in what interests her,' Amadou says, 'and she is interested in what interests me, and we talk about it every day.' Sitting there on the sofa, in this unadorned apartment a very long way from where they set out, Mariam agrees, moves closer to her husband, hanging on his words, occasionally reaching to stroke the back of his neck. Otherwise, they suggest, the secret of their happiness is all about timetabling. Amadou is an early riser, he writes his songs - intricate in structure - as the sun is coming up. Mariam is a night owl, she does her writing - songs from the heart - before bed. They meet in the middle of the day to compare notes, sometimes they disagree ('of course, we have a different vision of things occasionally') but eventually, invariably, they still make beautiful music.</p> <h2>Damon Albarn on the 'Geezer' Amadou</h2> <p> 'I love these people. I first met Amadou and Mariam years ago, though I can't actually remember when. They are a classic rock and roll, soul duo. You won't find anything more authentic, genuine or ecstatic this side of Bamako. Miriam's voice makes me go all funny and Amadou is a fucking geezer.'</p> <p>\u2022 'Sabali' (Because Music) is released on October 27 with Welcome To Mali to follow on November 17.

  "<p><strong>Land Rover Defender 90</strong><br><strong>From \u00a318,905<br>Miles per gallon: 28.2<br>CO2 per km: 266 GRAMS <br>Good for: dirt tracks<br>Bad for: rare grooves</strong></p> <p>It's been a busy year for Huey. He's appeared at motorshows in Detroit and New York, visited a quarry near Dusseldorf and been to a book launch at Eastnor Castle. Huey, or to give him his full name, HUE 166, is the first Land Rover that was ever built. He rolled off the production line in 1948 and to celebrate his 60th birthday he's been on a global tour. </p> <p>A few weeks ago I was lucky enough to catch up with him in a field outside Milton Keynes. He may be a little a creaky in his joints, but with the sun glinting on his fresh Keswick-green paint job, he looked in high spirits. Huey's handler gave me the keys and I clambered in, feeling quite starstruck. I can't say it was the smoothest drive I've ever had. But it was certainly one of the most historic. </p> <p>Since Huey was introduced in 1948, more than 4m of his brothers and sisters (can a Landy be female? I'm not sure) have travelled to the far corners of the world, working in many of the planet's most hostile places and, yes, that includes Kensington High Street. Indeed, for thousands of people living in the most remote areas, those early Land Rovers would have been among the first machines many of them would ever have seen. </p> <p>You may have believed that the Land Rover - the archetypal British battler - came into being as part of the war effort. But the war had been over for three years when Huey was created, and he was actually born into a life of agricultural labour. For years he was known as the Farmer's Friend. </p> <p>The first sketch was made in the sand on the beach at Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey by the engineering director of Rover, Maurice Wilks. He wanted a versatile vehicle that could double as a light tractor and off-roader. It was christened the 'Land Rover' and his first prototype was built using an American Willys Jeep. The launch price was \u00a3450 and in that first year 1,758 vehicles were sold. Today, around 25,000 are sold every year, but many of the original models are still going strong. Series I Land Rovers sent to Costa Rica to work on coffee plantations in the Fifties, for instance, are still in daily use.</p> <p>To get to know Huey's ways a little better, I've spent the past week driving a Defender 90 - his direct spiritual heir. And it seems his spartan approach to life has survived almost perfectly intact. Everything is built to be indestructible and easy to use. The switches are enormous and are labelled ON or OFF. There's no Softie Walter creature comforts. No gimmickry, no computers, no see-you-home lights. It's a car that's made to work hard and won't break or complain in the process. Compared to the brain-numbing complexity of modern cars, the Defender is a Luddite's delight. There's no vanity mirror, no carpeting, no glove compartment. There is a stereo, though - which, tuned to The Archers while I parked in a muddy field for a wet picnic, seemed the perfect way to celebrate Huey's 60th.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>It was at Andy Anderson's print shop that I first encountered the young lawyer-revolutionary Nelson Mandela. He was not a frequent shebeener or drinker, but 40 years later, when he was president and I was his biographer, he would often introduce me to others - including Prince Charles - by saying: 'I first met Tony in a shebeen.' The encounter should have been imprinted on my mind, but my memory was shaky, I was probably quite drunk, and he recalled it better than I.</p> <p>Soon afterwards I saw Mandela on a much more memorable occasion when I watched him launch the Defiance Campaign, of which he was chief volunteer. On 26 June 1952 I drove out to Boksburg, a grim mining town outside Johannesburg, to watch him assembling the first batch of 52 'defiers', including Indians as well as Africans, who gathered outside the township and then walked through the gates with quiet dignity, to be arrested by the police for illegally entering - while Mandela stood by calmly.</p> <p>It was the beginning of the open resistance to apartheid which would culminate in Mandela's imprisonment 10 years later, but it was a low-key event, designed to offer no provocation, and few people recognised its significance. Two months later I commissioned Mandela to write a short article in the Johannesburg-based magazine I was editing called Drum, entitled 'We defy' - his first major contribution - which spelt out his commitment: 'Though it takes us years,' he wrote, 'we are prepared to continue the campaign until the six unjust laws we have chosen for the present phase are done away with.' After some copies had been printed we had to scrap the article because it became illegal after Mandela and others had been arrested.</p> <p>I would love to recollect that I recognised Mandela from the start as a true leader of his people, destined to change the course of history. But in truth at that time I sadly underestimated him: he seemed to me too flashy and vain, with his immaculate suits and his wide smile, and he kept aloof from most white observers; I found his rhetoric too formal and stilted, full of anti-colonialist clich\u00e9s. I was much more impressed by his mentor, Walter Sisulu, and by his legal partner, the intellectual Oliver Tambo. It was not until 1964, when he made his first great speech in court before going to jail, that I realised his true courage and total commitment.</p> <p>I left Johannesburg in 1955, returning to England, and took up a post at The Observer. I occasionally returned to South Africa, most memorably at the end of Nelson Mandela's long second trial, when he and his colleagues were charged with conspiring to overthrow the state. The atmosphere was bleak after two years of oppression. The police were more professional and ruthless, with the help of detentions, torture and more systematic intelligence which they had learnt in Israel and the US. White Johannesburg was booming with the help of massive foreign investment: Barclays Bank and ICI proclaimed their support with shining new business palaces, and the blacks showed little outward sign of resistance except for a few scrawled slogans, such as 'Apartheid Means War'. </p> <p>I had a glimpse of the power of the state when I went to Pretoria to observe the trial. The Supreme Court was packed with armed police, who watched the spectators like hawks and took down all names. I sat on the press bench watching the prisoners being led up from the cells under the court. The familiar faces of Walter Sisulu, the Indian activist Ahmed Kathrada and Mandela, which I had seen so relaxed in their homes, now looked drawn and austere in their prison clothes: they were all facing a possible death sentence. Then Mandela looked back at the courtroom, recognised me, smiled and pointed me out to his colleagues. Instinctively I responded with the ANC clenched-fist salute. Immediately an Afrikaner policeman rushed up and beckoned me out of my seat. He questioned me for 10 minutes about how I knew the accused and what I was signalling to him, before I was allowed back, to the visible enjoyment of the prisoners.</p> <p>When the trial was adjourned I was approached by one of the defence lawyers, George Bizos, a stocky, bushy-haired Greek barrister who later became a close friend. He told me that Mandela was now asking me to advise him about the long speech he had prepared, with an eye on international opinion. So I spent an extraordinary evening in the lawyers' room alongside the court with the defence team, including Bizos, Arthur Chaskalson, Joel Joffe and Bram Fischer, the dedicated Afrikaner communist who led the defence. They showed me Mandela's long draft speech, which he had prepared in his own hand. I was engrossed by his moving testimony of his political development: how his tribal elders had first made him aware of African injustices, how he had widened his horizons and embraced the multiracial struggle with the help of communist allies, and how he had been compelled to begin the armed struggle when passive resistance was suppressed by the violence of the state. I made a few suggestions about the style and presentation, which were mostly ignored: probably rightly, for the text as it emerged was one of the historic speeches of the 20th century. I would always feel privileged to have been minimally involved in it, and to have worked briefly with these dedicated lawyers who would all become friends; for the first time I appreciated the law as the ultimate safeguard against autocracy.</p> <p>The end of the trial, on 12 June 1964, was my last sight of Mandela for 26 years, and my last glimpse of black South Africans before they entered a long age of darkness and repression.</p> <p>By the end of the Eighties, Nelson Mandela the prisoner had become an icon with little connection with reality. I could not relate the icon to the revolutionary I had known in the Fifties. For almost 30 years no photograph of him had appeared. In 1985 I had watched Oliver Tambo unveiling the huge bust of Mandela outside the Royal Festival Hall, but I could barely recognise the head, with thick lips and bull-neck like a Soviet workers' hero, quite unlike the expressive face I had known in the early Sixties. Newspapers and TV programmes kept preparing for his release and looked desperately around for anyone who knew anything about Mandela. 'You mean you actually knew him?' a CBS interviewer asked me with astonishment. I was tempted to romanticise a friendship with a legend and to suppress my first impressions of him as a touchy and arrogant man; and in truth I knew little about how he had developed in jail, though his lawyer, George Bizos, assured me he was a formidable presence. I still dreaded that his release would prove an anticlimax, revealing a tired old man of 71 emerging like Rip Van Winkle, hopelessly out of touch with the modern world. How could he confront a powerful military state and shrewd Afrikaner politicians determined to divide the black opposition? Mandela was worried while in prison, as he himself told me later, that his overblown fame had made people believe he was a superman. How much power could be wielded by a myth?</p> <p>And after 40 years watching the emergence of independent Africa I could not feel very optimistic about the black leadership. After the lesson of Nkrumah, the Redeemer of Ghana; Kenyatta, the Father of Kenya, and Amin, the Field Marshal of Uganda, western conservatives argued the message was clear: the Africans were simply unfit to govern themselves. </p> <p>Would Mandela and his colleagues be the same when they gained independence? After this African history I had to be sceptical. But since I had known them as young men I had always found the black South African politicians quite different from others in the continent, with their long history of patient resistance, their sense of discipline and their exposure to western ideas. And I had seen and heard enough of Mandela to know that he had developed into a much more serious leader than the demagogues in the north.</p> <p>To my growing frustration I was still banned from South Africa, over a piece I had written for The Observer, but I longed to show my wife Sally the country she had never seen. So in late 1989 I called on the friendly new South African ambassador in London. He reminded me courteously that I was still banned, but then explained that his government wanted the world to know how rapidly the situation was improving and eventually gave me a visa overwritten with the strange stipulation 'To assess the changing situation in South Africa in 18 days'.</p> <p>The country was changing much faster than I had ever imagined. In February 1990, two days before Sally and I flew to Johannesburg, President FW de Klerk made his historic speech to parliament, announcing that the African National Congress was unbanned and that Mandela would shortly be released. At Johannesburg airport the global media were already converging to report on the world's most famous prisoner. We stayed with my old friend Nadine Gordimer and watched with her the liberation of old friends who had been banned for 30 years, returning like ghosts from the past.</p> <p>The Johannesburg Star published long lists of people who were suddenly unbanned, including many old Drum writers, most of them dead, like Todd Matshikiza, Bloke Modisane or Can Themba, listed with aliases from the police files as if they were big-time criminals: 'Daniel Canadoce Temba, alias Temba Dan Can, alias Themba-Dorsay Can, alias Mvalise'. Nadine gave a party where our old friends speculated about the extent of the change. Zeke Mphahlele was still sceptical: 'It's easy for those in power to unban people: it doesn't mean they lose control.' Bram Fischer's daughter Ilse explained that her dead father's ashes were still banned, kept in prison. But we were thrilled to watch the crumbling of apartheid and the end of the 'collective madness' as Nadine called it, and I was delighted to see again politicians I had known 30 years before, with their values and ideals unchanged by prison, apparently oblivious of the hiatus.</p> <p>When I arranged to meet Ahmed Kathrada, Mandela's jail colleague, he suggested we meet 'near the flat' - meaning the place where we had last met when we were both in our twenties. I found Walter Sisulu, Mandela's mentor and jail colleague, in the Soweto box house where I used to see him in the Fifties. As he came out to welcome me, white haired but sprightly, he warned me to lock my car: 'Remember how Pat Duncan had his coat stolen.' </p> <p>Mandela was still in jail, but six days after we arrived we heard he would be released the next day. The following morning we caught a plane to Cape Town, to watch him make his first speech at the City Hall; but the streets were solid with crowds, so we drove to the British embassy, where we were now staying. We watched the historic event on television with the ambassador, Robin Renwick, and his colleagues, who gave us the diplomats' view. As Mandela spoke from the balcony in the fading twilight their faces fell and Renwick quickly left the room to telephone London. Mandela was reading a speech which had clearly been drafted by an ANC committee, reaffirming the militant policy and the armed struggle, while the diplomats had expected that he would present himself as an independent statesman and peacemaker. But it seemed to me that Mandela could only be useful if he remained loyal to the ANC: he could only make peace if he carried his people behind him.</p> <p>Mandela soon flew up to Johannesburg to address a mass rally and then returned to his small house in Soweto. When I telephoned the house, his wife Winnie answered. 'I keep pinching myself to believe that it's true,' she said, putting me straight through to Nelson, who talked as if nothing much had happened in 30 years. 'Hello, Tony, when are you coming here? How's the family?'</p> <p>Two days later I drove out with Sally to the box house in Vilikazi Street where I had visited him in the Sixties. An ANC flag was flying from the concrete garage - the flag which had been illegal two weeks before - and the house was surrounded by photographers and TV vans: schoolgirls were peeping through the garden wall into the small patch, where a tall black man with grey hair was talking to a TV team.At the door was Peter Magubane, the veteran Drum cameraman who was now Mandela's personal photographer. Over the past years he had frequently been detained for supporting the ANC, and had seen many false dawns: 'Is this really It?' I asked him.</p> <p>'Yes, it's It. They can't put it back.'</p> <p>In the house, we were greeted by Winnie, who was preparing a meal in the kitchen. Mandela strode in, looking far too big for the room, perfectly groomed in a double-breasted suit: his white hair shaky walk betrayed his 71 years, while his hug revealed the bony body beneath his tailoring. But he seemed much more serene than the man I remembered: his smile was no longer a wide showbiz grin but the relaxed, amused smile of someone at peace with himself. He sat down with his big boxer's hands resting on the dining-table, and asked about his London friends, Mary Benson and David Astor, who had sent him law books in jail. He looked Sally up and down and said: 'I remember Tony as a bright young man. He didn't tell me about you; he's kept things from me.'</p> <p>A few days later I went back again with three journalists. This time Mandela was the pure politician: he eloquently thanked the media for keeping the cause of liberation alive, and stressed that South Africa must have a free press. He praised Nadine Gordimer and said that my Anatomy of Britain had been the first book he had received in prison. He played down his own role and emphasised that he remained the loyal servant of the ANC. 'They may say: \"Well, you are a man of 71, you may require a pension.\" Or \"Look, we don't like your face, please go.\" I will obey them.'</p> <p>Back in London I still kept some contact with Mandela, for he practised diplomacy in a very personal way, relying on individual friends rather than bureaucrats. When I was able to see him later in Johannesburg he discussed how the ANC could rectify false reports in the British media: he gave me his home phone number and said: 'Why don't you just ring me when you see something that needs correcting?' - as his aide looked on in despair. </p> <p>I saw him again in April, when he paid a short, triumphant visit to London with Winnie, who appeared the ideal consort, gracious and attentive. He attended a pop concert at Wembley Stadium, addressing a crowd of 75,000 people, to thank them for their past support: 'You elected not to forget.' It was televised live by the BBC, which was attacked by right-wing conservatives who complained of political bias. In the interval Mandela moved through a crowded reception room, welcoming admirers. My daughter Katie was introduced to him, and he replied firmly: 'Remember you're a person in your own right.'</p> <p>There was much speculation about a meeting with Thatcher; Mandela's ANC colleagues insisted he must postpone it, but he persisted with his personal diplomacy. One Saturday night in June 1990 I was just going to sleep when Adelaide Tambo woke me with an odd request: 'My brother is in England and wants to see his girlfriend tomorrow morning.' The code meant Mandela wanted to see Thatcher. </p> <p>I rang her private secretary, Charles Powell, and early the next day Thatcher made a long phone call to Mandela. He urged her to maintain sanctions against Pretoria, without success; but she disarmed him by showing a maternal worry about his forthcoming trip to America: 'If you go on like this you won't come out alive.'</p> <p>After touring America, Mandela came back to London, where Thatcher was anxious to show her respect. Douglas Hurd gave a private lunch for his friends, including the president of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, Trevor Huddleston, South African MP Helen Suzman and myself. Mandela was appreciative, but restated the need to maintain sanctions, despite 'my sister Helen'. He went on to see Thatcher for the first time. Robin Renwick had urged her to let Mandela talk uninterrupted, since he had been waiting for 27 years incommunicado; he spoke for 52 minutes, before she replied for half an hour. She was warm and charming, Mandela told me, and he resented critics who complained he should not have talked to an enemy who had denounced him as a terrorist. He had to work with people who had done far worse things in South Africa, he explained: 'I didn't even mention slaughters.'</p> <p>In London the crowds gazed upon Mandela with reverent awe, which exasperated his critics, especially those who pointed to his conviction for terrorism. In fact, he was never a terrorist in either the Palestinian or the Israeli sense: he had taken up arms as the last resort to confront a terrorist state, and he had avoided any attack on civilians. But he was certainly never a spiritual leader: he was a master politician who understood the nature of power.</p> <p>I went back to South Africa frequently, which was still suspended between two disconnected worlds. When I called on Mandela and his colleagues in their brand-new office in Johannesburg they sounded confident that they would soon achieve power, yet in the interim they lacked any formal authority; while the whites in the suburbs appeared quite unaware of impending change and were doing little to adapt to it. Mandela, the old man who had been out of the world for a quarter of a century, was now, as Nadine Gordimer said, 'the personification of the future'; while many young whites were stuck in the past. </p> <p>The future at last began to take some shape when the government agreed to begin negotiations in the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). When I talked with the ANC delegation they sounded confident that Mandela would soon become president and de Klerk his deputy; but there were all kinds of spoilers, including Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the right-wing Afrikaners. The negotiations continued on and off over two years, with recurring breakdowns, culminating in June 1993, when the thugs of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement invaded the building, smashing through windows, to try to halt the talks. But at last, at the end of 1993, Mandela and de Klerk agreed on a new constitution and elections based on a simple one-person-one-vote system, and the first democratic elections were fixed for April 1994.</p> <p>Mandela was well aware that elections depended on cash: he had been raising funds round the world for the ANC ever since he left prison. He was never embarrassed by using his prestige to extract large sums of money from questionable people or former opponents. At the Dorchester Hotel in May 1993, before the election, he addressed a grand reception attended by the chairmen of most of the big companies, including Lord Weinstock of GEC and Lord King of British Airways, most of whom had opposed the ANC before it was legalised; now they queued up to shake Mandela's hand. Among them were scattered veteran anti-apartheid campaigners, who bristled as Mandela smiled and chatted with their ex-enemies. Trevor Huddleston was still filled with 'holy anger' and complained to me fiercely: how could Mandela forgive these villains? It was odd to hear the Christian father rebuking the political campaigner for being too forgiving. But Mandela had no time for recriminations, and he raised huge sums which eventually dwarfed de Klerk's election chest.</p> <p>The plans for elections went ahead, surrounded by hazards and uncertainties. The Afrikaner right wing refused to participate, and a band of extremists invaded the neighbouring bantustan of Bophuthatswana, until they met an ignominious defeat.</p> <p>'South Africa braced itself for a race war and civil war yesterday,' wrote the Sunday Times, the chief prophet of doom in London. Buthelezi also boycotted the elections and organised a march of Zulus through Johannesburg, which provoked deadly reprisals from the ANC. Then a week before election day he finally gave in, after pressure from all sides, and joined the elections.</p> <p>I flew out to Johannesburg with Sally to watch the elections in April 1994: the last surrender of white power in Africa. The walls and lampposts were plastered with Mandela posters and the initials ANC. They seemed at odds with the street names like Empire Way or Eton Road, or an estate called Settlers' Park.</p> <p>In the lily-white northern suburbs the prospect of a black government still seemed unimaginable. But Nadine's house was an island of continuity, the same as 40 years ago, and parts of Johannesburg were reverting to the multiracial existence I had known before apartheid. Sally and I went together to the musical Sophiatown, which featured the now-legendary Drum writers.</p> <p>Mandela was already being hailed as the victor. We went to the final ANC rally in the huge stadium near Soweto, where he arrived by helicopter and strode through the arena, with an entourage of drum majorettes, witch doctors and pop singers. He spoke like a president: when a gun went off he sternly rebuked the crowd. As he left in his car he reached out to shake my hand, but a security guard quickly intervened and closed the window.</p> <p>Two days later, at a press conference at the Carlton Hotel, Mandela radiated authority. He insisted on the importance of gun control and community policing: when he was asked about his personal feelings he would only say: 'Certain things cannot be expressed in words.'</p> <p>The mood was still tense, with fears of violence: on the eve of the election a bomb exploded at the airport, and on polling day another went off at the ANC headquarters downtown. But the polling stations in the townships were suffused with an extraordinary calm, as patient blacks lined up in winding queues for three or four hours to vote, while monitors from the UN or the Commonwealth watched for irregularities or intimidation. All the political violence was dissolved by the passionate faith in democracy.</p> <p>The next day I talked to Mandela at the Carlton Hotel, when he was clearly about to become president. Did he ever imagine 40 years earlier that he would be in this position? 'No, we were too busy fighting apartheid; and I was a junior then. I was convinced that there was no better leader than Tambo.' He rejected any praise of his personal leadership: 'No single individual can be elevated above others.' Could he not go too far in practising forgiveness and forgetting about evil? 'No,' he answered firmly. 'Men of peace must not think about recriminations or retribution; courageous people don't fear forgiving, for the sake of peace.'</p> <p>When the ANC victory was announced, with just short of two-thirds of the vote, there was no serious dispute. After all the predictions about bloodbaths, the power had been transferred from whites to blacks with little disruption. 'It was like being alive in the time of Lincoln,' wrote the New York Times. Only a few conservative journalists dissented: 'Dawn of freedom my foot,' wrote my old sparring-partner Peregrine Worsthorne in the Sunday Telegraph. 'Black majority rule in South Africa should send a shudder round the world.'</p> <p>On our last day, Sally and I went to a celebration lunch party given by Adelaide Tambo in her luxurious villa, where Walter Sisulu, the 80-year-old father figure of the struggle, was guest of honour. Adelaide gave a gracious speech thanking the foreign guests, including the British MPs Paul Boateng and Bob Hughes, David Dinkins, the mayor of New York, and myself. It was a first glimpse of old revolutionaries as they faced the responsibilities of power. Sisulu hugged me and said: 'We've done it.' What had they done? </p> <p>A few months later I visited the new ministers in their government offices. The guerrilla leader Joe Modise was now minister of defence; the ex-head of the Communist Party, Joe Slovo, was minister of housing. Parliament was transformed from an Afrikaner stronghold into a multiracial assembly full of bright tribal costumes. 'I love this dream,' said Archbishop Desmond Tutu. 'You sit in the balcony and look down and count all the terrorists. They are all sitting there passing laws. It is incredible.' </p> <p>The young minister, Pahad, drove us on a tour of the ministers' houses, enclosed in the beautiful and secluded Groote Schuur estate outside Cape Town. The old freedom fighters looked very unradical in those comfortable surroundings: we found Thabo Mbeki's father Govan, the Marxist firebrand, listening to Alistair Cooke's Letter from America. 'Now I know why you were all so keen for power,' I teased Pahad. 'But the funny thing is,' he replied, 'we didn't know all this was here.'</p> <p>When a minister asked me for advice on handling civil servants, I proposed that they watch the TV series Yes, Minister, but he replied: 'Oh, we've already seen the videos.' The transition on the surface was smoother than many had expected: the bureaucrats were keen to please, and the Afrikaner secretaries and security guards were soon calling the black ministers 'Sir'; power, in the end, had no colour bar. </p> <p>Mandela himself moved into the grand presidential offices as if he had always been groomed to be head of state: confident and courteous, springing out of his chair to greet a visitor, and introducing his Afrikaner PA, who brought the tea. I found him always welcoming and personal, asking about my family, reminiscing about old Drum friends, talking about London and the Queen Mother. But he was never off guard. He knew the impact of anything he said: if he said something slightly indiscreet he would instinctively put his hand over the tape recorder and he would always veer away from discussing his personal feelings.</p> <p>I was still fascinated by the story of how this serene president had developed from the headstrong revolutionary I had known in the Fifties; so I was excited when my publishers in 1995 suggested I write his authorised biography. Mandela asked me to breakfast in his house in Johannesburg, and said with customary flattery that he knew no one more qualified to write it: he wanted a biographer who had known him in his earlier political years, provided I didn't mention we had met in a shebeen.</p> <p>\u2022 Anthony Sampson was on the staff of The Observer from 1955 to 1966 and its chief US correspondent from 1973 to 1974.

  "<p>Gary Hume famously once said: 'The surface is all you get of me', and one can see what he means. His paintings are immaculate shimmering surfaces, as shiny as car bonnets, emanating poise and tranquillity and not much in the way of intellectual content. I always used to think of them as beautiful pictures for beautiful people - they would go very nicely in, say, a Pawson-designed penthouse with a spot of whale music on the stereo - but the art world has always taken them very seriously. Hume was probably the first of the YBAs to be embraced by the art establishment - the first to win the Jerwood Prize in 1997, the first to represent Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1999, the first to be elected to the Royal Academy in 2001. And now, very late in the day, I have come to see the point of him, largely as a result of seeing a retrospective of his early door paintings at Modern Art Oxford and also some new paintings to be shown at Lorcan O'Neill's gallery in Rome next month.</p> <p>Given that his work is so smooth and polished, he is remarkably unsmooth himself. He has blotchy skin and red-rimmed eyes, and a sly diamond-geezer smile that makes you think you wouldn't necessarily want to buy a used car off him. When I sit down, there is a terrible crunching sound, and he points to a heap of shattered china on the floor and exclaims: 'Oh! You've broken it!' before collapsing in gales of laughter. At 46, he still likes practical jokes, but I'm not sure that I always know when he is joking. Any time I ask what one of his paintings is meant to depict, he says: 'That's a cunt.' Me: 'Then what's that thin bit going up the middle?' 'Sperm.' And again, looking at another painting: 'What's this brown tree trunk? 'Another cunt.' 'What's this pink bit?' 'That's her clitoris, but it's in the wrong place.' It is indeed. I think he must be joking.</p> <p>He used to have a ramshackle studio behind Tracey Emin's in Spitalfields, but now he has a very smart purpose-built office-cum-studio in Clerkenwell, with a brand-new Vespa parked in the hall and at least three assistants working round the place. There is a load of furniture on the mezzanine because he and his wife, the artist Georgie Hopton, have just sold their house in Hoxton and not yet bought a new one. They also have a farm in the foothills of the Catskills in upstate New York, where they spend about four months a year. He always goes in February to make maple syrup and in the summer to tend the vegetable garden, but he paints there as much as in London. The only difference is that he doesn't have any assistants in New York so he has to clean his own brushes, which he hates doing.</p> <p>There are about a dozen big paintings standing round his studio, some finished, some 'waiting'. They are all in his favourite medium - high-gloss paint on aluminium, because 'I LOVE gloss paint, totally love it, and I can't see myself ever stopping.' He likes the fact that gloss paint reflects light so that the colours change according to the time of day, and sometimes you can see your reflection in them. And he uses aluminium because it is smoother and shinier than canvas. It's not much more expensive, he says - about \u00a3400 for a panel that would cost \u00a3350 in canvas.</p> <p>His paintings look simple, but in fact they are extremely complicated to make. He starts from a found image, maybe an advertisement, maybe a flower or bird illustration, which he traces on to acetate and projects on to the wall. (He says he can't draw, though I think I did spot a pile of drawings in his studio - he wouldn't let me look at them, though.) He arranges and simplifies the image till he is happy with it, then transfers it on to aluminium and builds up the lines with draught excluder - a very fiddly process which he hands over to assistants as much as he can - to make the lines effectively walls or dams between different areas of paint. Then he brushes the paint in and cuts the draught excluder away, which leaves a sharp edge, almost like the leading in stained glass. 'The edge is the only thing that matters,' he once explained. 'I used to think of the areas of colour as tectonic plates meeting, so in the paintings it's like there are these molten plates that would hit each other and dry. I wanted one of those plates to be higher than the other, and I wanted the hit to be more abrupt. I found that draught excluder does the job perfectly.'</p> <p>He does all this work with the painting laid flat and says there is often a moment of disappointment when he stands it upright - 'It just says: \"You're telling me I'm finished, but just look at how rubbish I am.\"' (This is one of the weird things about him - he often talks as if he and his paintings are in conversation.) So then he leaves the painting standing round the studio for weeks till he decides what to do with it. 'Sometimes you look at it and think: \"Omygod, I love that,\" so that one's finished, but sometimes you think: \"Well, I like it but how could it be better?\" And you just wait and see - see where the doubt's going, really.' He likes the difficult paintings that don't come right immediately. 'You get your food from the awkward ones - like: \"Why are you awkward? Why do I believe you work, but you're still awkward? When will I see what I can do to make you like the beautiful ones? But you don't even want to be a beautiful one. You're happy to be your own awkward self. Let the beautiful people stroll about and you stay awkward.\"'</p> <p>In recent years, he has occasionally ventured into other mediums. There was a series of pictures made in marble and stone for his 2006 White Cube Cave Paintings show, and some sculptures made in painted bronze (using the arms from shop mannequins as legs) for the subsequent year's American Tan show. And now he has designed a tapestry for a new exhibition called Demons, Yarns &amp; Tales, which commissioned a dozen artists - Hume, Gavin Turk, Grayson Perry, Peter Blake and others - to contribute designs for tapestries to be made in China. Hume's is called Georgie and Orchids and is based on one of the Water Paintings he showed at the 1999 Venice Biennale. 'I've always loved tapestry,' he explains. 'Do you know The Lady and the Unicorn in Paris? I did a lot of paintings from those tapestries. And initially tapestry was really good for me because it has very little pictorial depth - things float in space, and nothing recedes; it's all on the same plane - which is how I paint. And it's interesting to see what happens to your work when the materials change. But I'm not going to become a tapestry-maker!'</p> <p>His paintings sell for up to \u00a3250,000, but he says he's only begun to feel wealthy in the past year. 'I'd done OK before, but now I can say: \"Ooh, I've almost paid my mortgage.\" So now it's fantastic, but it takes a long time to get to that. I lived on nothing for years - squatted where I lived and where I worked, stole electricity, made things from stuff I found in skips, used paper that had been discarded - you do everything you can do to keep going and not have to get a job. But it's not part of my ambition to become fabulously rich. My plan was always to make my pictures and hopefully people would buy them and then I'd buy a studio, buy a house, help friends out, do bits and bobs - but I've no idea after that.'</p> <p>He was born in 1962 in Tenterden, Kent, the fourth of five children. His mother worked as an NHS surgery manager to support them all. He says fourth of five is a good place to be because 'by then your mother's totally exhausted and realises that making rules is just a losing battle and the kids have turned out all right anyway, so she gives you a bit of a break'. His father disappeared when he was 18 months old. 'He just went off. He had whole tribes of families all over the place. He's dead now.' Was he an artist? 'No, he was a criminal. But maybe that's creative, too - there might be some connection there.' What sort of criminal? 'Useless. A con man.' Hume saw him once, but never made any effort to see him again. Wasn't he curious to know about his father? 'No. What's in the blood? Who knows? My mum's a fantastic woman. But I was determined my son would have a father. He wouldn't not have one.'</p> <p>Mildly dyslexic, Hume left school at 16 with no qualifications and went round Soho knocking on the doors of film-editing suites till he stumbled into a job. He was 'sort of guessing' that he wanted to work in film and thinking he would learn about it by editing because he would see how films were put together. 'But quite quickly, after a year or two, I realised it wasn't for me at all because I couldn't really work with anyone. I knew my ideas were better. It was fine with the other editors because they'd say: \"All right then, give it a go.\" But the directors, they got annoyed. There was one documentary where I could see they were lying - because as an editor you get to see all the rushes - and we had a huge row and the director wouldn't speak to me and it was all terrible.'</p> <p>So then he lived on the dole and did labouring jobs. He was a bricklayer's hod carrier, and then a snotter, whose job is filing the rough bits off pointing to leave a sharp line - good preparation for what he does with the lines in his paintings now. At 20, he started taking life-drawing classes at a working men's college in Camden and paid for them by modelling. Was that embarrassing? 'Nah. I didn't care. I was young, skinny. I mean, there obviously is an erotic element, but if you're working, the erotic element dissipates almost instantaneously because you're concentrating.'</p> <p>Lack of GCSEs meant he couldn't get on to an art foundation course so he had to spend two years on a day tech course with 16-year-olds before he got a grant to do an art degree at Liverpool Polytechnic. In his second year, he managed to switch to Goldsmiths by saying he had to be in London 'for personal reasons', though he refused to say what they were. In Liverpool he'd been painting dock landscapes with a palette knife: 'But I knew it wasn't at all what I wanted to do. I was learning how to be some other artist rather than my own. I didn't really know very much about art. All I knew was the WH Smith artists - Picasso, C\u00e9zanne, Degas. It wasn't until I was back in London that, of course, Joseph Beuys was hugely important, and Andy Warhol, and it was so completely different to Liverpool. Suddenly I'm in this place where people aren't doing anything as art! So I thought: \"Oh that's another possibility, is it?\" I thought it was a fantastic thing. It was about freedom.'</p> <p>He was one of that golden Goldsmiths generation that emerged from the Freeze show of 1988 to become the YBAs. They had such confidence, such power. Where did it come from? 'The teaching must have had a lot to do with it - that whole thing of saying \"You are an artist\" rather than \"You are a student.\" So you felt you're already in the game - even though you're terrible at it - so that was an empowering thing. And we were competitive and supportive all at the same time: \"That's good, you bastard!\" - I loved that attitude. And we all had absolutely nothing to lose, we were all very young, very poor.' Hume recently re-met all his old Goldsmiths' mates at the memorial for Angus Fairhurst, who hanged himself from a tree in Scotland earlier this year - he was the first of the group to die, and it brought them all back together. But Hume says he'd kept in touch with most of them anyway - 'I mean, we are family in a way. We're not going to fuck each other over.'</p> <p>At Goldsmiths, Hume went out with Sarah Lucas and she was 'fantastic. Always confident, a live wire, torn between loving certain aspects of male formalism and hating the beer-swilling misogynists who corralled it'. Many men might have felt threatened by Lucas's fierce feminism, but he didn't because 'I was brought up by my mum. I love women. Of course I do have my own machoness and my own pride: this is how I feel and yes, I do need a fuck. But I've got no time for male authority, not having had a dad. The moment someone tells me what to do, I ignore them.'</p> <p>But Hume was unusual among the students in that he already had a son, Joe, who lived with his mother, an archivist, most of the time, but with Hume for five days a fortnight. 'So when it all went coke-istic, I wasn't always there. I was having very different experiences - I was in playgrounds bored and lonely, and in mother and toddler groups as the only man, listening to terrible accounts of pissing and shitting all the time. So I was the dad, both in love with my child and bored out of my mind.' He has never had another child - he says he and his wife only want to make art.</p> <p>Does it feel like a long time since Goldsmiths, or the blink of an eye?</p> <p>'Well, my child's 21, at college in the States, and it's only a moment ago he was a wee little baby and now he's a young man. But it feels like yesterday because there's never enough time. If you're creating something, there's never enough time and you're running out of time every day.'</p> <p>His career took off straight from Goldsmiths - Charles Saatchi bought two of his door paintings from Freeze and commissioned another four. But Hume only met Saatchi once, when he had a show at Saatchi's old Boundary Road gallery. 'He'd hung a painting the wrong way round and said he preferred it that way. It was a four-door painting, four panels, and he swapped them round. And I told him: \"No.\" It was very funny because he had all his people there and every single one agreed with him, and I said: \"Charles you pay these people of course they're going to agree with you!\"' Saatchi has since sold all his Humes, presumably at a vast profit. Hume says he doesn't care - he takes no interest in who buys his work.</p> <p>For four years, Hume painted nothing but doors. They started when he saw a photograph of hospital doors in a Bupa advert and then he went to St Bart's and measured real doors and painted them life-size in high-gloss paint. Soon there was a queue of collectors waiting to buy them, and he and his then dealer Karsten Schubert were coining it. But in 1992 he was halfway through another door painting and realised he was too bored to finish it. That was the end of the doors - and, it turned out, the end of his relationship with Schubert. When he started painting again, he moved to White Cube. But the doors were reshown this summer at Modern Art Oxford, and Hume says he felt really proud seeing them again. 'It was weird, obviously. Because, of course, you're fascinated with what you're doing in the present, and you're not really sure whether the past will hold up any more. So it was a bit nerve-wracking, and it was interesting to see whether what felt crucial when they were made still had any currency or not. Like one of them, My Guernica, was made with plenty of frustrated rage, and I was sort of breaking my own rules [it has wavy lines, whereas the others are geometric], and it felt really radical and emotional. But looking at it now, who could even tell? But anyway I felt proud seeing them again.'</p> <p>I've always wondered whether we're supposed to know that they are hospital doors - is that important? 'I think it does help, yes. Only because they're classless. And not meant to evoke home.' Are they meant to make us feel anxious, alienated? 'No. You're not necessarily alienated in a hospital environment. It could be a joyful thing - you're having a baby, or you've been poorly and you become well. But I suppose they're like a clear metaphor for one transition or another. My job is to find the - how do you say it? - multiplicity of possibilities and what the work can hold, but I don't need to be dogmatic about it.'</p> <p>Given that he is now proud of the door paintings, why did he go off them so abruptly? 'Because I'd done so many and it was just too limited for my imagination. It felt like I could be just churning them out, and the only intriguing bit was whether to become more and more formal or break with that entirely and destroy all formalism - say, by getting a real hospital door and screwing it to the wall. Either way it seemed like I was going to ruin what I'd done, so I thought: \"Well I'll just break it by not doing them any more.\" The last one I painted, I was halfway through, and I stood back and thought: \"I've had enough.\" I couldn't even be bothered to finish it. It looked good unfinished. It was the last one and I thought: \"I'm not going to do them any more.\" It was a relief; I felt very happy.'</p> <p>But then there was a long period when he couldn't decide what else to paint. 'I was searching for another intellectual rational permission and I couldn't really find one.' What does he mean, 'permission'? 'Permission to make. Permission for the picture to exist. And I couldn't find anything that was satisfying enough for me intellectually. Anything I'd create I'd think: \"Well, it's all right, but it's a bit stupid.\" And it just went on and on like that for ages until I gave up looking for a rational way to give myself permission to make things and decided just to make things more emotive.' He made a short film called Me as King Cnut of himself sitting in a bathtub trying and failing to tell a joke. 'That was the first time I described the dilemma. But then I still had to paint a painting. So I made a painting called Roots. I was interested in potatoes, because they're the staple food and they're underground and they spread by tubers and nothing is visible, but there's plenty of food if you dig, and that seemed to be an analogy for my whole process I was in, that I was a potato. So I made this Roots painting and it turned out I liked it. So then I thought I could paint again.' Since then his subjects have ranged from flowers to celebs (Tony Blackburn, Patsy Kensit, Michael Jackson), to nudes, to snowmen, to children's toys, to polar bears - and he is currently working on a series of bird chicks.</p> <p>Has he ever suffered another creative block since the doors crisis? 'I get them, like, twice a week. I have a real moan and my wife tells me to shut up. But not as serious. Because now I work all the time and I know that the only way out of it - because I can't think my way out of it - is to paint my way out of it, so I just have to work and live with the consequences.' Is he quite an anxious person? 'No, but I'm desperate for them to be good. And, of course, that breeds some anxiety. But I generally try to work in a joyful state.'</p> <p>And yet his paintings often feel obscurely melancholy, a bit like Andy Warhol's. He once said: \"I want to paint something that's gorgeous, something that's perfect. So that it's full of sadness.\"' Does he see a connection between beauty and melancholy? 'Yes. There has to be. Otherwise you'd be too naive to experience life. I want a quietness. I want the work to be quiet. And verging on the romantic, but with a sense of reflection - and generally speaking, that does become melancholic. I find it very satisfying to be moved into a sort of quietude and peace.'</p> <p>\u2022 Demons, Yarns &amp; Tales is at The Dairy, 7 Wakefield Street, London WC1 (020 7243 7345; <a href=\"http://www.bannersofpersuasion.com\">bannersofpersuasion.com</a>) from 10-22 November</p>",
  "<p>In the name of integration, they took the Neath and the Swansea out of the title. They are just the Ospreys by name now, but not just the Ospreys by expectation. </p> <p>This is the Welsh region that won the Celtic League twice in three years between 2005 and 2007, the side that more or less to a man in 2008 swapped their black-and-white shirts for the red of Wales, and became the grand slam champions of the Six Nations. This is the team that rather knocked Leicester around in the final to become champions of the EDF Energy Cup last season. </p> <p>But these are also the Ospreys who have every reason to be troubled by the Heineken Cup, the competition they have not cracked. Today they launch their latest attempt, away to Leicester at Welford Road, and they have not been able to dodge the issues surrounding what went wrong last season. </p> <p>There they were, fresh from that magnificent Six Nations campaign, still in form so hot that they made Saracens look silly in the EDF Energy Cup semi-final, beating them 30-3 at the Millennium Stadium. They were to play the same opponents in the quarter-final of the Heineken Cup. Admittedly, they had to swap home advantage for Vicarage Road, but, really, what could go wrong? </p> <p>Saracens assaulted the Ospreys in the return encounter and reduced them to a raggedness that haunts those that survived to this day. Coach Lyn Jones lost his job because of that 19-10 defeat. </p> <p>But just to show that twitchiness was not cured by change the Ospreys, now under Jones's former assistants Sean Holley and Jonathan Humphreys, warmed up for today's game, only last Sunday in the EDF, with a disturbingly uncontrolled second-half performance against Harlequins' second string. It prompted the questions: are the Ospreys more complex than they would appear, or are they simply less than they would seem? </p> <p>This business of integration, of shrinking the name, stripping it of old identities, is important. Swansea is a city, a port, different from the valley towns of the old South Wales coalfield. If it had to have a connection, it would have its own valley, named after itself, the Swansea Valley following the course of its own river (Swansea in Welsh is Abertawe, Mouth of the Tawe).</p> <p>Neath, one fold over to the east, has its own Vale, from the bottom of which it could stare, like a hostile neighbour over the fence, at the city, a downwind spit away, but culturally on a different planet. For as long as rugby was played the way it used to be, there was no greater rivalry in the game than between the Welsh All Blacks and the All Whites, between Neath and Swansea. </p> <p>And then came the modern era and the making of the Welsh regions. The creation of the Ospreys was not a birth, more a last job for the smelting works of Vale and Valley: join two repelling forces together and weld them tight. It would never work, they said. </p> <p>But it did. The region became a model of assimilation, playing out of a parcel of land with no history, the Liberty Stadium. As noted, they dropped their ancestral titles, no longer the Neath...#8209;Swansea Ospreys. </p> <p>They train at a halfway point between their old piles - between, that is, the Gnoll in Neath and St Helen's in Swansea - at the old BP sports ground in the village of Llandarcy (the Church of William Knox D'Arcy, the founding director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, forerunner of BP), where a refinery was built in the 1930s. This is now the very modern Llandarcy Academy of Sport. </p> <p>There, last Thursday, five of the Ospreys - players Richard Hibbard, Jonathan Thomas and Shane Williams, plus coaches Holley and Humphreys - present themselves, all peas in a pod, in identikit, casual Ospreys uniform. If they mention the word 'team' once they mention it a hundred times: team environment, team spirit, playing as a team... </p> <p>You may have guessed that the Ospreys recognise that to win in Europe they have to convert their undisputed, undeniably prodigious individual talent into a collective effort. </p> <p>'We know we have the talent as players,' says back-rower Thomas, outstanding in the Six Nations last year and now more muscled to the tune of five kilos. 'But we haven't always delivered as a unit. We know we had a wobble against Harlequins. Twelve months ago we wouldn't have pulled it back, but we stuck at it, scored the late try, and James [Hook] kicked the winning conversion. That's what we've been concentrating on, staying strong together, like Munster, keeping going to the very end.'</p> <p>But what do you do about Shane Williams in a team now obsessed with suppressing individual will? The most electric runner in the game cannot be tied to the common wheel, surely. </p> <p>'My brain seems to work in a slightly different way...' says our Shane, the most self-deprecating of stars. As if he realised this might not sound right he quickly adds: 'No, no... it's just that I can't stop myself doing certain things...' </p> <p>And have the coaches built into the team plan a permit for Shane to be Shane? 'I suppose, um, they haven't told me not to keep doing - or at least, trying things. But, really, and I mean this, really, I'm more than happy doing my bit. For the team, that is.' </p> <p>That's clear, then. And just when you've worked out the answer to Just The Ospreys, along comes Gavin Henson - or rather, along he doesn't come for training. Dropping him for two rounds of the Heineken Cup may reinforce the mantra: team before individual. But it also underlines that the work of uniting the Ospreys may keep the smelting works of Neath and Swansea going for quite some time yet.</p>",
  "<p>October. Still a good three months before the Alps open for business and I can snowboard. What to do? I want something active: lying by a pool reading books doesn't appeal at the moment. It seems too decadent as stock markets crash and the world as we know it collapses. Instead I want to feel like I do after a day on the powder, lactic acid burning in my muscles, tired, sleepy, happy, all anger spent. And then it hits me: why not surfing? At first glance, the two sports appear to have much in common. The love of outdoors, the strange coded language (are you goofy or regular?) and the often ridiculous clothing seem to conspire to make the two activities intimate bedfellows.</p> <p>The problem for me has always been the surfers, the whole cultish surfing philosophy, the faux Californian Sixties neo-hippie thing. I just don't get it. In fact, I refuse to get it. I'm 35, not 17, and don't want to spend my holidays with people who insist on banging on about the miracle of nature and the fact that the wave they have just caught has crossed thousands of miles to deliver them, personally, to the shore. Eventually, though, desperation wins out. Thanks to the credit crunch, snowboarding in Chile or New Zealand has been jettisoned. I need a more inexpensive way of pushing myself. </p> <p>Before I go to Lanzarote (cheap and cheerful, I think; that's why they call it 'Lanzagrotty'), I'm worried surfing will be a bit of a doddle. How hard can it be to stand on a 10-ft plank for a minute or so? I hold this thought right through the first few hours of surfing school as we are taught on the beach to jump on giant hard-foam training boards and paddle for an imaginary wave. I hold the thought as I carry my board into the sea, right up until the moment the giant wave - all three feet of it - knocks me backwards and I swallow half the Atlantic. </p> <p>This is the not the first time my beliefs about this holiday have crashed and burned. For a start, Tim Jones, genial head of Surf School Lanzarote, based in the village of Caleta de Famara, in the north-west of the island, is not your average surf bum. At 51, Tim, who hails from Cardiff, is unlikely to wear the sort of surfing shorts that look as if they've been fashioned from your gran's curtains by a tailor on an acid trip. </p> <p>He set up Britain's first surfing school in Devon a quarter of a century ago and, if anything, his passion for the sport now is even greater than then. Over lunch - sitting on the sand munching a cheese and cucumber sandwich, something of a staple on the course - Tim delivers lectures about the history of surfing, exercise, tides and etiquette. It's inspiring, albeit sometimes complicated stuff. He also has uncanny peripheral vision. There are 14 of us bobbing around in the sea and Tim seems to be able to watch our every attempt to ride a wave. His feedback is detailed and bang on the money. After watching my puny attempts, he switches me to a slightly smaller board. I expect no difference, but suddenly I am coasting into shore, lying horizontal on the board with a massive grin on my face.</p> <p>Another belief - really a prejudice - which gets binned almost immediately after the four-hour flight from Luton, is about Lanzarote itself. It is clear that the island has been criminally traduced by much of the world. Lanzarote is startlingly beautiful, its dark, volcanic rocks eerie and sombre like a moonscape. As the car navigates car-less roads that hug cavernous coves revealing gorgeous sandy beaches, I get a feeling I have been here before. Only later, when someone says they filmed some of Star Wars here, do I realise why. </p> <p>At the end of a tiny track, welcoming lights blink in the distance, signalling the end of my journey. This is the centre of the island's wine-growing region and as darkness falls I make out the vines peering out of black stone, surviving seemingly impossible odds to flourish in such an arid environment. Cacti and palm trees are dotted around Finca Malvasia's beautifully lit swimming pool, a blue oasis around which nestle seven single-storey white-washed lodges. There is a cool breeze in the air and the hibiscus and geraniums sway gently.</p> <p>The finca - a small farm in the village of Masdache - is still and calm, surrounded by vineyards and brooding hills. The old farm building next to the lodges has retained many original features, and the landscaped gardens are perfect for reclining on sun loungers and enjoying one of the many types of massage on offer. Richard and Tarnya, the English couple who run the finca, sold their London-based software firm a few years back and ploughed some of the money into turning the finca into the sort of place that inevitably earns the label 'boutique' but in this case comes without any of the po-faced haughtiness such places often inspire. </p> <p>Instead of luxuriating in their success, they are keen to put something back into the island. Both are learning Spanish and their three-year-old son, Joss, is enrolled in the local kindergarten. They buy from neighbouring farmers and markets to prepare their delicious tagine and paella dinners, which are served in private on the terraces outside each lodge. One day, they hope to develop their own-label wine from their vineyards surrounding the finca. </p> <p>As I graze on boquerones and asparagus, succulently ripe tomatoes and air-dried ham, Richard and Tarnya talk of their ambivalence about the 'Lanzagrotty' title. On one hand, they say, it's a shame that people often cannot see beyond the false label. On the other, those who do visit are blown away by a place that greatly exceeds expectations.</p> <p>That it does so is at least partly down to the lifetime's work of one man, the island's most famous son, C\u00e9sar Manrique. An aesthete, he was given a mandate by the island's government to oversee the roll-out of much of the architecture throughout the Seventies and onwards. The uniform white-washed walls and the low-slung style of the buildings - all the more stark against their black sandy backdrop - are testimony to the cool power of his vision. </p> <p>True, if you want to find the 'typical' Lanzarote (whatever that is), you can head for those resorts Manrique never got his hands on, such as Playa Honda, where faux 'Oirish' pubs are thronged with Brits enjoying cheap package holidays at any time of the year thanks to the permanently temperate climate. Or you could head into Arrecife, the island's capital - but it was closed when I went.</p> <p>It's inland where Manrique's influence is most acute. A visit to his house, which, since his death in 1992, has been transformed into an architectural paean to his memory, is a must. As is a trip to one of Manrique's most outstanding creations, the Jameos del Agua, a series of caves boasting a natural auditorium, pools and bars carved out of rock that encapsulate the kitsch elegance of a 1970s Bond movie. </p> <p>Bus transport is not one of the island's strengths and taxis are expensive, so a hire car is necessary. It enabled me to drive to Bodega Ugo, a charming restaurant on the way to Yaiza, serving freshly caught salmon and tuna, wonderfully fibrous octopus, and Iberico pork steaks, cut into strips, blackened and salted on the outside, red on the inside, that melt in the mouth.</p> <p>It also took me to La Caba\u00f1a, a restaurant in Macher run by Debbie and Darren Spurr. Darren cooks in an open-plan kitchen so diners can watch their meal being prepared. The fresh-grilled squid and the sea bass in a lemon sauce were heavenly. </p> <p>On my last day I head back into the surf, weary from days of paddling for waves that never came. It is my first time on a proper hardboard surfboard, but something magical happens. I paddle as the wave starts to break then spring, or rather stagger, to my feet. For about 10 seconds I am surfing - properly - and everything suddenly comes together, all those days of training, the lunchtime lectures, the endless cheese rolls ... </p> <p>My aches disappear and I feel exhausted and elated. A thought wanders into my mind: 'That wave has travelled thousands of miles to carry me to the shore.' Oh damn. I've become one of them.</p> <h2>Essentials</h2> <p>An apartment for two at Finca Malvasia (<a href=\"http://www.fincamalvasia.com\">fincamalvasia.com</a>) costs from \u20ac120 a night.

  "<p>For the past six years the Icelandic investors of Baugur have been worshipped like rock stars in the British retail sector. Handsome executive chairman Jon Asgeir Johannesson seduced the Square Mile as he strutted up the high street, window-shopping for fashion stores and jewellers.</p> <p>The group's chic black-panelled New Bond Street offices in the heart of London's shopping district look more like a trendy nightclub than the corporate headquarters of a \u00a35bn-turnover retail business, complete with a sculpture of a Viking carrying a guitar and giant fishtank. Baugur has bought stakes in a swath of high street retailers including French Connection, Moss Bros and Debenhams, often in league with fashion entrepreneur Kevin Stanford, who co-founded Karen Millen.</p> <p>But this weekend, Baugur's empire, which includes House of Fraser and Hamleys the toy store, could be broken up as British tycoon Sir Philip Green stands poised to plunder its choicest assets. If he succeeds, it will mark the end of a Nordic retail invasion that has swept across Britain in the last seven years.</p> <p>Home to just 300,000 people, Iceland is seen to epitomise the global credit boom that has turned to bust. Over the past eight years its banks expanded dramatically overseas and by 2007 their assets amounted to about nine times the country's gross domestic product. All that changed last week. Its three largest banks, Kaupthing, Glitnir and Landsbanki, are now under state control. Baugur could be the next domino to fall.</p> <p>There has long been scepticism over Baugur's financial health, especially as it was so closely linked with Icelandic banks. But Baugur chief executive Gunnar Sigurdsson always insisted that the Icelandic banks held only minority shareholdings and - in a worst case scenario - if their positions were liquidated standard pre-emption clauses would apply, giving shareholders the right to acquire their stakes. He continues to stand firmly on this line. </p> <p>Baugur's investments include supermarket chain Iceland; jewellery group Aurum Holdings, which owns Goldsmiths and Mappin &amp; Webb; and Mosaic Fashions, a fashion group which owns eight brands including Coast, Karen Millen, Oasis, Principles and Warehouse and employs an estimated 53,000 people.</p> <p>Some Baugur investments have already turned sour in the past year but they were considered small fry. Value chain MK One ended up in administration while health food chain Julian Graves was sold. The group has tried to restore confidence by issuing trading updates from Aurum and Mosaic. These showed that underlying sales were up 7.4 per cent at Aurum in the last year, although operating profits fell 2.6 per cent to \u00a39.3m after it switched to selling lower-margin watches. Mosaic reported earnings up 6 per cent to \u00a333.4m in the six months to 26 July on sales of \u00a3410m.</p> <p>Johannesson is the son of a supermarket retailer. With the help of his father and cheap Icelandic financing, Baugur expanded aggressively overseas. The company's rise coincided with that of Iceland's financial community as the country became a major force in Europe using cheap money to build up massive property and retail investments.</p> <p>But Iceland's banks also tended to invest in each other. A tendency for aggressive borrowing, as well as a policy of taking equity stakes in property and retail ventures, meant that problems in one bank infected others and compounded their problems.</p> <p>The biggest individual UK casualty of the Icelandic bank crash is Robert Tchenguiz. Last Wednesday the colourful tycoon was forced to sell substantial stakes in J Sainsbury and pub group Mitchell &amp; Butler at a loss estimated to be in the region of \u00a3800m.</p> <p>Friends of Tchenguiz, who is keeping a low profile while he assesses his options, say that he is 'keeping a brave face' on what is a stunning fall to earth for the sociable financier. One of those options could include legal redress. When it became clear that Iceland's government would not guarantee British savers' deposits, Gordon Brown reacted with fury. He invoked terrorist legislation to freeze assets associated with Icelandic banks.</p> <p>The decision, say Kaupthing insiders, effectively led to the collapse of the bank and precipitated Tchenguiz's startling losses. </p> <p>Tchenguiz's aides and Kaupthing insiders refuse to acknowledge that it may have been the bank's unsustainable borrowings against assets whose value could not be justified that lay behind its downfall.</p> <p>While Tchenguiz's substantial property holdings are said by sources close to the tycoon to be in good shape, his equities business has been 'annihilated'. His brother Vincent is also thought to have lost tens of millions in the wake of the Icelandic disaster through his interests in Consensus Business Group.</p> <p>The brash Candy brothers, who are behind some of the most ambitious upmarket residential developments in London, appear to have benefited from Kaupthing's demise. The development arm of the Candy empire was involved in a number of joint ventures with Kaupthing but has exercised options to snap up a Beverley Hills project in the US as well as a residential scheme on the former Middlesex Hospital site in central London as Kaupthing liquidates its assets.</p> <p>Some suggest, though, that the brothers are set to suffer in the downturn because of large costs associated with their central London housing schemes, which could now be difficult to sell. The Candys have indicated that they are prepared to mothball sites.</p> <p>The Icelandic banking community is furious with Prime Minister Geir Haarde for marching into Glitnir, the third biggest bank, last week. It accuses him of being a 'left-wing green' who has no understanding of financial intricacies. Haarde, though, served as an economist in Iceland's central bank before becoming an adviser at the Ministry of Finance.</p> <p>Icelandic banks have provided long-term loans as well as working capital facilities to many retailers during the buyout frenzy fuelled by the consumer boom of the past decade. However, last week's state bail-out has left many businesses in limbo.</p> <p>Advisers said some retailers would have trouble accessing working capital, potentially having an effect on daily operations such as paying staff and suppliers. Mosaic has a \u00a375m revolving credit facility but insiders said it had already made use of this facility. However credit insurer Coface has already pulled cover on firms that supply Baugur leaving them exposed were it to default.</p> <p>Like other Icelandic firms Baugur could sell its stakes in listed retailers, a move that would crystallise already heavy paper losses due to bombed-out valuations in the sector. Unwinding its 13 per cent holding in Debenhams - which is held through derivatives - is likely to put further pressure on the department store group's share price, which is already down 60 per cent in the last year at 40.75p.</p> <p>Baugur is not the only Icelandic-backed investor thought to have problems. Insurer Exista has been a less prolific investor in UK but its purchase of JJB founder Dave Whelan's 29 per cent stake for \u00a3190m last summer has proved disastrous. Today the whole company is worth just \u00a343.6m after the shares collapsed on the back of poor trading and allegations it had breached its banking covenants. But Exista has far bigger problems on its hands - it is Kaupthing's largest shareholder. This week Exista has been raising funds by liquidating other investments and there is mounting speculation it could do the same with JJB.</p> <p>Warning signs are also flashing at little-known investment vehicle Arev, once dubbed the new Baugur. Run by former Baugur executive Jon Scheving Thorsteinsson it owns Jones the Bootmaker, leather goods brand Aspinal of London as well as stakes in Hardy Amies and fashion brand Ghost. Hardy Amies fell into administration on Friday while Ghost is seeking finance. Highlighting the complex web of relationships among Icelandic-backed firms is Ghost, which is co-owned by Stanford who co-owns fashion chain All Saints and some of its listed share holdings with Baugur. Stanford is thought to be facing substantial losses but could not be reached for comment.</p> <p>In just 10 days, Iceland's economy has been devastated. The reverberations are set to engulf the British high street.</p>",
  "<p>It was 19 minutes to noon on Wednesday when Gordon Brown took the call from Mervyn King. With the seconds ticking away to the Prime Minister's first Question Time in the Commons since the summer break, the governor of the Bank of England had dramatic news: secret consultations between the world's most powerful central bankers had resulted in the decision to make the biggest co-ordinated cut in interest rates there had ever been.</p> <p>With the world's financial system perilously close to complete meltdown, bankers were determined to show they meant business. The move was to be announced at midday in London and 7am New York time, and King was nervous that Brown might be embarrassed by a backbencher picking up the news via BlackBerry as he stood up to speak.</p> <p>Brown had already been dealing with the financial crisis for more than six hours that morning, having held a 5am summit with Chancellor Alistair Darling at Number 11 to discuss details of a \u00a350bn part-nationalisation of Britain's bombed-out banks, due to be unveiled to the stock exchange that morning.</p> <p>With just 10 minutes to go before world markets heard the news, King's next call was to Darling. Both Prime Minister and Chancellor had been hoping for a rate cut for many weeks as the credit crisis began to take its toll on Britain's cash-strapped borrowers, threatening to tip the economy into a severe recession.</p> <p>Just before Brown stood up to explain his drastic bail-out plan to Parliament, US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson was appearing before reporters in Washington in an attempt to reassure American voters that their savings were safe. Asked if he planned to emulate Brown's bail-out package, Paulson was sniffy, defending his own $700bn 'troubled asset recovery plan'. Yet within little more than 48 hours, he was signing up to a promise by the G7 finance ministers to pour public cash into struggling banks, buying shares to ease the severe shortage of capital in the world's financial sector.</p> <p>The reason for the volte-face was simple: Wall Street was locked into a vertiginous sell-off as terrified investors dumped stocks, commodities and the dollar, fearing that the mounting financial crisis would turn into a full-blown economic slump.</p> <p>By the time the G7 finance ministers gathered in Washington on Friday afternoon, there was no doubt whatever that they were looking at disaster. The half-point rate cut, unthinkable just a few days before, was greeted with a shrug by investors who had lost their faith in governments' powers to fix the world economy. Wall Street had suffered the worst week in its history, with the Dow Jones index losing an extraordinary 18 per cent of its value, and every major stock market had plunged, day after day. On Friday alone, the Dow hurtled an eye-watering 700 points downwards, then swung up into positive territory, before settling 'only' 128 points down.</p> <p>General Motors, once the proud symbol of America's car industry, was worth less by the end of the week than it was in 1929, and felt obliged to issue a statement saying it was not at risk of bankruptcy. By Saturday, it had announced talks about a merger with its rival Chrysler. Morgan Stanley was in desperate talks to save a proposed cash injection from the Japanese bank Mitsubishi, and on Wall Street the buzz was that Paulson's damascene conversion to state intervention had been triggered by the impending demise of another household name of US banking.</p> <p>Thousands of miles away in Iceland, once a sleepy but prosperous example of the cautious Nordic economic model, a decade of financial excess was ending in tears. Reykjavik has been brought to the edge of national bankruptcy by its overstretched financial firms, and deposits from thousands of British savers, along with money belonging to local authorities and charities, was tied up in Icelandic banks. An IMF team was dispatched to assess its need for an emergency loan. Reports in Washington suggested that other countries were also teetering on the brink of insolvency.</p> <p>G7 ministers were keen to avoid the policy paralysis that had been so evident when Nicolas Sarkozy gathered the leaders of Europe's big four economies in Paris a week earlier. Then, declarations of solidarity were swiftly belied by Germany's unilateral decision to guarantee all bank deposits, an example of the beggar-my-neighbour behaviour that had helped to deepen the Great Depression. The world's financial markets had delivered a clear message about the costs of indecision and disarray.</p> <p>The strain of wrestling with the crisis was clearly visible on the faces of the finance ministers. France's Christine Lagarde, Washington's Hank Paulson and Alistair Darling all looked as if they had been burning the midnight oil - which they had. It didn't help that on Saturday, they all had to be at the White House by 6.45am to get security clearance for their breakfast meeting with George Bush.</p> <p>The President has repeated his mantra that if they work together, the West's biggest economies would get through the crisis. For the first time since the turmoil entered a new and dangerous phase, Bush's remarks did not send share prices tumbling - but only because the market was closed for the weekend.</p> <p>Darling's morning continued with a bilateral with Paulson, and talks with the new chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Lord Turner, over the plans for recapitalising some of Britain's biggest banks, details of which will be announced tomorrow.</p> <p>Around the table at the US Treasury, Darling argued forcefully that recapitalising banks with public cash was the only viable solution to the worldwide crisis. Japanese delegates, rarely the most vehement contributors to G7 debates, argued passionately that the lesson from their country's own catastrophic banking crisis in the 1990s was that taxpayer-backed bail-outs of financial institutions should be carried out without delay. So keen was King to push home the importance of unblocking the credit markets, he summoned up the ghost of Elvis Presley, saying, 'as the King would say - a little less conversation, a little more action'.</p> <p>It was not Elvis but the desperate need to restore calm to the markets that really prodded the G7 into action, however. When civil servants presented a first draft of the communiqu\u00e9, several pages long and packed with waffle, finance ministers said they wouldn't sign it - because it wouldn't work.</p> <p>Italian finance minister Giulio Tremonti even went public, saying 'the current draft is too weak', and wouldn't, at first, put his name to anything more than a page long. When the meeting ended, what emerged was a five-point plan, including a promise to buy up stakes in banks, on the British model.</p> <p>Governments also pledged to prevent the failure of 'systemically important' banks, in a bid to avoid unleashing another financial domino effect like the one that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers; take 'all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets'; ensure that consumers around the world can have confidence in the safety of their savings; and take action to kick-start stalled markets in the mortgage-backed assets and other securities that banks use to help fund their lending.</p> <p>In other words, governments of the world's richest countries will unleash every weapon they have, including billions of pounds of taxpayers' money, to rebuild the global banking system and reopen the flow of credit to consumers and households. Paulson called it 'aggressive,' but that was an understatement - it is financial 'shock and awe'.</p> <p>There are high hopes in Washington that this much concentrated firepower, perhaps combined with more drastic rate cuts from central banks, must eventually work - though European Central Bank governor Jean-Claude Trichet said it might still take time for the markets to respond positively. If this plan does succeed, finance ministers can stop worrying about the risk of total collapse of the world's financial system - and start worrying about the long, grinding recession that most believe will follow this month of extraordinary drama.</p> <p>When Paulson was drafted into Washington from Goldman Sachs in 2006, with his action man demeanour and impeccable Wall Street pedigree he seemed the ideal personification of America's economic invincibility. Two years on, he, and the swashbuckling model of capitalism he represents look like a busted flush. Even even his friends on Wall Street have dramatically lost faith in his power to halt the financial storm.</p> <p>For 50 years, America has been the global economy's uncontested superpower, preaching open markets, financial liberalisation and free trade. Washington confidently believed it had the answer to the world's economic problems, if only the unconverted would listen. But last week showed that the US has no magic recipe to assuage the violent fear that had seized Wall Street, let alone offer a blueprint for other governments to follow.</p> <p>Every time delegates from developing countries thumbed through a newspaper, or glanced at a TV screen, they saw bleak red graphs of plunging stock markets or footage of an earnest-looking Bush using an emergency briefing in the White House rose garden to reassure shell-shocked American voters.</p> <p>The US public are bailing out of mutual funds in their droves and discussing where the hard-earned cash they have saved for retirement or their kids' college funds will be least at risk. Safe-makers are reporting rising sales as a growing number of Americans resort to the old-fashioned method of withdrawing their dollars and locking them up at home.</p> <p>At every press conference within the tight ring of security that surrounds the IMF's HQ, a forest of hands shot up, as journalists from Brazil, the Philippines, Russia, China and a host of other countries asked urgently what impact the crisis would have on their home countries.</p> <p>For the past decade, World Bank and IMF meetings have been dominated by the problems of the world's poorest countries. The crash of 2008 has followed the longest sustained boom in the global economy since the late 1960s and early 1970s, breeding the complacent belief that the only real issue was how to help poverty-stricken countries in Africa catch up. This year, the mood had changed: Africa barely merited a mention, as the West concentrated exclusively on preventing its home-grown crisis dragging the entire world into a slump.</p> <p>The problem is twofold: in the short term, the vital need is to stop the financial virus from infecting every country in the world and having an even bigger impact on global growth. In the longer term it is how to rebuild a world financial system that has so comprehensively failed in the past 14 months.</p> <p>In 12 months' time, when the IMF gathers for its next annual meeting in Istanbul, the world may look very different. There is a palpable sense in Washington that even if the downturn is shorter and sharper than the IMF predicts, the domino effect that began in America's housing market and has rippled throughout the world, is leaving in its wake a powerful momentum for reform.</p> <p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the IMF's managing director, stressed that there must be no return to 'business as usual' when the worst of the crisis is over. At the very least, there will be reforms to what the experts call the 'global financial architecture' - in other words, the rules will be tightened.</p> <p>Credit ratings agencies, which assess how likely borrowers are to repay their debts, will find their activities reined in; regulators monitoring the behaviour of international banks across different jurisdictions will be forced to work more closely together; and the IMF is likely to be given stronger powers to issue warnings about the build-up of dangerous financial bubbles in the years ahead.</p> <p>Central bankers who have contented themselves for the past decade with focusing on inflation, may well also be asked to take into account the risk that by cutting interest rates to keep economies out of recession they may be pumping up an unsustainable boom. Alan Greenspan, the former US Federal Reserve chairman, was once lionised as an economic 'maestro', but now appears to be a major architect of the crisis. The IMF said the world economy had been allowed to run above its 'speed limit' for too long.</p> <p>The banks, which have been forced to beg for public cash to prevent their business model imploding, will find themselves under severe scrutiny from their new shareholder, the taxpayer. In return for rescuing them, governments will insist on limits on bonus payouts and curbs on dividends to shareholders.</p> <p>There are broader changes afoot, too. Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank and a veteran of the US Treasury, called for seven major emerging economies to join the traditional G7 club of rich countries to provide a better reflection of the new power balance in the world economy. Bringing Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa on board would create a powerful 'steering group,' representing 70 per cent of the world's GDP and 56 per cent of its population. Zoellick's pointed call for change underlines the mood for reform unleashed by the crisis.</p> <p>Iceland may yet be forced to turn to the IMF for an emergency loan, but the fact that it was given direct financial support first by the Russian government underlines the power that countries which have built up huge financial surpluses - including Russia, but also China and many Middle Eastern economies - could wield in the years ahead.</p> <p>How deep the changes go may depend on how badly the shortage of credit affects the global economy. The IMF believes that, after a grim year, with recessions in most major countries, the green shoots of recovery will be visible beneath the frost.</p> <p>Olivier Blanchard, the IMF's chief economist, insisted that with the right concerted action from governments, the risk that the financial crisis would give way to a full-blown depression on the scale of the 1930s was 'almost nil'. Yet he was also quoted warning that share prices could have another 20 per cent to fall before calm is restored: hardly the sort of thing to reassure investors in the current environment.</p> <p>The governments of the world's largest economies think they've done enough to avert disaster. This week, they will be watching anxiously watching to see if the markets agree.</p> <h2> A year of rescues</h2> <p><strong>14 September 2007 </strong><br>Bank of England steps in with emergency funding to support Northern Rock.</p> <p><strong>17 March 2008 </strong><br>Federal Reserve organises the rescue of Bear Stearns. </p> <p><strong>7 September </strong><br>US government seizes control of mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p> <p><strong>17 September </strong><br>US rescues insurer AIG.</p> <p><strong>26 September </strong><br>US government takes control of Washington Mutual in the largest-ever American bank failure.</p> <p><strong>29 September</strong> <br>UK government nationalises Bradford &amp; Bingley's loan book.</p> <p><strong>30 September</strong> <br>Ireland guarantees the deposits of all savers.</p> <p><strong>3 October</strong> <br>Biggest ever US government bail-out plan - worth $700bn - clears House of Representatives after being rejected a week earlier. </p> <p><strong>7 October</strong> <br>Iceland asks Russia for \u20ac4bn loan to avoid financial meltdown.</p> <p><strong>8 October </strong><br>Chancellor Alistair Darling announces \u00a3450bn rescue plan for Britain's ailing banks.

  "<p>The gloves came off in the Glenrothes by-election campaign last night as Labour accused SNP leader Alex Salmond of wanting to turn Scotland into the 'new Iceland'. </p> <p>Labour, struggling to prevent an SNP victory on 6 November, believes it can exploit Salmond's repeated claims that Scotland should join an 'arc of prosperity' made up of independent nations such as Iceland and Ireland - both of which have been badly hit by the global financial crisis. </p> <p>With Gordon Brown certain to break with convention and campaign in Glenrothes, which borders his own Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat, his party believes it can turn the economic turmoil to its advantage, arguing that Scots will be safer as part of the UK.</p> <p>Labour, seen by bookies as the underdog, is defending a 10,664 majority in what was once a Scottish stronghold.Salmond said repeatedly before the crisis that Scots would be substantially better off if they were part of a small, independent country. 'We have three countries - Ireland to our west, Iceland to our north and Norway to our east - all in the top six wealthiest countries in the world,' he argued two years ago. 'In contrast Scotland is in 18th place. We can join that arc of prosperity. By matching their success Scotland would be \u00a34,000-a-head better off.' Last night Lindsay Roy, the Labour candidate, said Gordon Brown's push for a proposed merger of HBOS and LloydsTSB would not have been possible if Scotland had been a separate country. 'There is no question that people are better off with Scotland as part of the UK. Here in Fife, there are almost 2,000 people employed by HBOS,' said Roy. 'Imagine the devastation that would be caused to those families if Scotland were separated from the rest of the UK. Alex Salmond said that he wants Scotland to be like Ireland and Iceland. Ireland is in recession and Iceland is bankrupt. That shows that the SNP ideas for Scotland's economy fall far short of the strength we get by being part of the UK. I don't want Scotland to be part of the arc of insolvency.'</p> <p>Michael Connarty, the Labour MP for Linlithgow and East Falkirk, said that as the SNP was unsure as to how they would run monetary policy and the economy after independence, people were less willing to give them their vote. 'There is a real sense now that people are less willing to take the risk of independence and this could substantially affect the vote,' he said.</p> <p>A senior SNP adviser said the party would not backtrack. 'No country large or small has been insulated from this economic crisis,' he said. 'The bottom line is that the more powers a country has at its disposal, the more able it is act. Norway, for instance, is protected by a \u00a3200bn oil fund it has built up over recent years.</p> <p>'If only we had been able to build up such a fund. That is why we need independence.'</p>",
  "<p>Everyone professes a love of trees. I cannot find anybody who'll admit to hating them, or the lesser charge of finding their gnarled trunks, light-blocking canopies or autumnal tendency to drop leaves everywhere even vaguely irksome. Ostensibly, then, we're a nation of tree fanciers and huggers who relish being custodians of a rich woodland legacy. No surprise that the oak tree is a potent symbol of Englishness, its proud crown even providing cover for the occasional monarch on the run. The sap of our great trees - a long and illustrious list topped by the oak, taking in the silver birch, beech and the ancient yew - runs deep in our very blood. </p> <p>Except that this is all a lot of nonsense. A paltry 2 per cent of Britain is now covered in fragmented ancient woodland (once, admittedly some 6,000 years ago, it was 75 per cent) and according to the Woodland Trust and Ancient Tree Forum, hundreds of woods are under threat from development. </p> <p>Head into town and things get worse. There's an embarrassing richness of council-loses-plot health and safety stories to choose from: highlights include South Tyneside's extreme pollarding of horse chestnuts into stumps to avoid injuries to children collecting conkers ('Conkers Bonkers' screamed the tabloids) and Islington council's removal of veteran pear trees, citing the risk of injury to passersby from 'oversized' fruit. But all these stories point to the same problem - we are losing our canopy of 'veteran', high, large trees in British towns and cities for no good reason.</p> <p>The February 2008 report by the Communities and Local Government Department, Trees in Towns II, bears this out. In 140 towns and cities surveyed for the report, planting programmes for new trees had either ground to a halt or slowed considerably in most cases, with just 0.4 per cent of the projected number of urban trees promised in London and the southeast planted in the previous five years. Meanwhile, tree-felling had picked up apace in many areas, including Edinburgh and Harrogate, but particularly in London, where 7,600 trees were given the chop in the boroughs of Croydon and Harrow alone, with just 2,600 replacements. Seventy-eight per cent of trees felled were aged between 10 and 50 years, and therefore likely to be part of the critical 'veteran' canopy. </p> <p>To be so complacent about trees - considering them take-it-or-leave-it clumps of verdant biomass - is to ignore their life-sustaining importance; to ignore that a big beech tree provides enough oxygen to satisfy the daily requirements of 10 people; that broadleaf British woodland supports a ridiculous amount of indigenous wildlife; that trees reduce noise by acting as a sound barrier; that they act as huge natural water pumps, moderate the local climate, provide shading for houses, and that one hectare of woodland grown to maturity absorbs the annual carbon emissions of 100 family cars. </p> <p>In fact, with every month, with every conference and research paper that passes, the necessity of a flourishing and protected treescape in both rural and urban areas is made more explicit. According to early reports of the revised UK 21st-century Climate Change Scenarios 2008 (from the UK Climate Impacts Programme) published next month, the study is expected to show greater temperature rises over the coming decades than previously thought. Who or what can help mitigate these effects? Why, trees, of course. </p> <p>A new study in Manchester suggests that increasing tree cover by 10 per cent (considered 'just about do-able') could reduce the surface temperature by 3-4C, therefore 'climate proofing' the city until the 2080s. Removing trees will only speed up rising surface temperatures. As David Ball, professor of risk management at Middlesex University, recently put it to an audience of silviculturalists, given that temperatures above 21C increase the risk of death, 'if you wanted to be a mass murderer you could chop down a lot of trees'. </p> <p>This theory makes us as a society accessories to countless crimes. We stand by while trees are blamed for 'stealing' light or water (remember that many of them predate the upstart buildings that are apparently protected by their removal), blocking CCTV cameras, or shedding their horrible leaves on pavements. But the chief accusation levelled against them, particularly in suburban and urban areas, is subsidence. The townscape's most useful trees - on account of maturity, ability to support nature and community value - the big, old gentlemen of traditional Victorian boulevards, particularly the great plane trees, are loathed by many insurers much as vampires hate garlic. Out of 40,000 trees felled by London boroughs in the past five years, subsidence was cited as the reason in 40 per cent of cases. But according to the 2007 London Assembly Environment Committee report on London's street trees, unequivocally titled Chainsaw Massacre, only 1 per cent of such subsidence fellings was justified, subsidence being an immensely complex business, with many contributors other than tree roots.</p> <p>It is tempting to write off veteran tree casualties and instead pin all our hopes for a greener, tree-lined future on their successors, the new saplings that will one day anchor their roots and spread their own canopies to cool our towns and oxygenate our air. However tree-planting programmes have become part of the political toolbox, the conservation equivalent of kissing babies. So it was no surprise that Boris Johnson announced in March that if elected London mayor in May he would scrap the official mayoral newsletter to fund the planting of 10,000 trees across 40 areas in London. But lest we get too excited we should take into account that the trend now is for planting of 'lollipop' trees - smaller growing, often ornamental species, whose small rootworks placate the insurance companies, but whose stunted canopies will never support wildlife, filter polluted air, or provide shading for rapidly heating cities in the way that veteran trees do. </p> <p>As we become increasingly used to seeing our townscapes deprived of big trees we can at least take heart that there appear to be big trees all over the countryside. 'Ah yes,' agrees retired publisher, prolific poet and equally prolific tree-planter Felix Dennis, 'we appear to have plenty of trees, but it's a confidence trick! When you travel by helicopter - as I do - you see exactly how denuded of high trees we are. You see big trees planted around the edges of fields and nothing in the middle. It's a facade.'</p> <p>Dennis, whose publishing empire includes Auto Express and Maxim, is the joint 101st richest person in Britain, according to The Sunday Times Rich List. Today, he is diverting some of that vast fortune into the ground.</p> <p>'You would imagine, wouldn't you,' he says, 'that you could fly a helicopter across uninterrupted woodland in the UK for an hour, but you'll get about one minute over the New Forest. I find the most common reaction of people after being in a helicopter over the New Forest is, \"Where's the forest?\" Our loss of trees has been camouflaged for generations. Go back! Go back to the Wars of the Roses, the Crimea, the Great Wars. Huge swathes of trees were cut down and never replanted. Nobody has any idea how bad things are.'</p> <p>Dennis sounds like he's being deliberately dramatic (not unknown), but he has a point. What woodland we now have left is extremely fragmented. Three-quarters of all woodlands in Britain are now under two hectares (4.94 acres). This means that in terms of protecting and enhancing biodiversity they do a far less effective job than larger, contiguous woodlands; for instance, while birds can easily fly, ground-based mammals, such as dormice and hedgehogs, aren't able to negotiate their way across roads and farmland so easily. </p> <p>Of course, there are new trees in the countryside, but the bulk of afforestation has come courtesy of 'exotic coniferous species'. This was particularly the case in the early Eighties, when private companies caught on to the splendid tax wheeze of planting large tracts of fast-growing coniferous forest, the maintenance of which all over Scottish hillsides could be offset against income tax. These forests look green but are anything but; fast-growing trees are structurally weak, they leach nutrients from the hillside and destabilise the soils. In a number of studies they have been shown to increase hillside erosion. In the late Nineties, when fast-growing forests were touted as a way to offset your carbon emissions, they were also shown to be pretty poor carbon sinks. </p> <p>Certainly, Dennis considers them unacceptable, and part of a long political tradition of conflating two sets of statistics - statistics for planting and types of trees - in order to pretend that Britain is being afforested when actually, rumbles Dennis menacingly, 'walking through a fast-growing conifer plantation is like walking through an abattoir. I mean, an English oak supports 1,000 different species. Those things [fast-growing conifers] are hopeless. You might as well stick plastic poles in the ground. </p> <p>'In terms of high tree cover,' Dennis adds, 'Germany has 25 per cent cover, France 26 per cent, Italy 24 per cent and Britain a pitiful 4.5 per cent. For the country in Europe with the most temperate climate, that is rubbish.'</p> <p>In typically unequivocal style, Dennis's solution is to plant what he claims will be Britain's biggest - or in his opinion 'only' - true broad-leaf forest: 20,000 acres when it is complete, full of native broadleaf trees, oak, ash, lime, birch, hornbeam and willow. Naturally the forest has an eponymous title, the Forest of Dennis. 'I've done 1,000 acres, just 19,000 to go!' he says brightly. 'I do need to speed up you know.' At my mention of climate change he begins to growl and segues into a monologue on eco Nazis and environmental puritanism - Dennis doesn't believe in climate change. So if he doesn't believe in climate change, why the imperative to plant? Where's the fire? 'My mortality, that's the fire,' he says. 'I've looked after lovers, friends and relatives in my will. The rest goes on buying land to plant the Forest of Dennis.'</p> <p>He refuses to tell me how much he's spent thus far. 'Rest assured, I'm spending plenty,' he says. 'Besides, it loses its merit if you start boasting.' And he adds that landowners near his Warwickshire forest triple and quadruple the price of land when they know he's involved - which doesn't help, as land is already at a premium at the moment, something that the Woodland Trust (the UK's largest woodland conservation charity) has found out. For several years now it has been outbid on sites in the southeast, as it looked for a home for the 'new Sherwood forest' - as the charity's latest project to create the largest native forest in the UK has been dubbed. In April, the Trust found its site at Sandridge, 858 acres in the middle of Hertfordshire, near St Albans, and agreed a price before the land went on the open market. As the crow flies it is 20 miles from Marble Arch and in one of the most populous parts of Britain. </p> <p>'It's a really great site,' says project manager Toby Bancroft, as we set off across farmland that will be planted some time next year. He is especially pleased by the 44 acres of ancient woodland dotted over the site. 'This is the UK's equivalent of rainforest,' he says of the ancient pockets. 'Ancient woodland has more wildlife species associated with it than any other habitat, and that includes marine habitats. We can't recreate this ever again.' </p> <p>When it's planted, this forest will contain 600,000 trees, which will help preserve ancient woods in the face of climate change. The bigger the habitat, the less the risk of losing woodland wildlife species. 'Some of these species, like dormice, are not great travellers,' says Bancroft. 'I guess that's why they've remained in ancient woodland when the risk from encroaching development has increased. The best we can do is to provide as much cover and habitat for them as possible, and we can do that by linking up ancient woodland by planting on the land in between.'</p> <p>What does Dennis think of this project? 'Well, God bless the Woodland Trust,' he says - and he's famously an atheist. 'I've planted more than that on my own already.' Indeed he has, and nothing's going to stop him, 'nothing except jail'. (He's already named a small wood after Justice Argyle, who sent him down in 1971 at the Oz obscenity trial.) Another thing that sets Dennis's forestry project apart is its high-quality land. 'It's good soil, not at all plashy,' he says. In which case shouldn't the land be used for food rather than forest? 'Well obviously I'm already being accused of starving people,' he says resignedly. This charge of irresponsible land-use has also been levelled at the Woodland Trust in Sandridge where much of the proposed tree planting will be on agricultural land. The two projects have more in common than either might care to acknowledge: buying land to guarantee future public access; aiming for continuous cover rather than pockets of multipurpose forestry; and bidding to be the lungs of the country. </p> <p>But hang on a minute - didn't we already plant our forestry lungs in the Nineties? In 1990, the Conservative government announced its intention to plant 200 square miles of new forest, with 3m new trees. It is easy to forget that Margaret Thatcher had a late 'green' period in the feverish build-up to the 1992 Rio Earth Summit; and her National Forest - planted to increase timber production, to provide a space for leisure projects, including rather counter-intuitively motorsports, and to plant more woodland - was quite difficult to sell. As Jonathan Steele wrote in 1995, 'Historians may one day look back at the idea of a government plan to create a National Forest in the heart of England as one of the more hopelessly idealistic schemes of the 20th century.'</p> <p>In fact, it appears the scheme has been far from hopeless. According to its website, 7m trees have been planted to date, and there is a general agreement among tree enthusiasts and charities that the National Forest has done a good job in terms of increasing tree cover, even if it has never enjoyed the funding it deserved. But compared with the Forest of Dennis and Sandridge, it looks very Eighties - a conservation project with shoulder pads. </p> <p>These big forest projects might provide a solution to increasing overall tree cover, but what about our day-to-day access to trees? </p> <p>'People do take trees for granted,' admits Graham Simmons, who runs Trees for Cities, a charity which aims to make trees a part of the urban landscape. 'There's a sense that because there's always been a tree there, it will just carry on growing, and they are really surprised and shocked when it's suddenly under threat.' By then it's often too late. Once the developers or insurers move in, the most you can hope for is that a Tree Preservation Order will be granted. A property developer tells me with a wry smile about receiving a tip-off from someone working in a planning department that a tree was about to be given a TPO the next day. What happened? 'Well, this would have put a spanner in the works of a multi-million-pound deal, so the developers rang round to get someone down there first with a chainsaw before the order was served. All they could get was a JCB to go in at 5am, but they got the tree out before the council offices opened and the TPO could be served.'</p> <p>Lynn Espiner is a retired teacher from Leeds. Along with her daughter Jill and mother Betty Furness, 81, she has become a Trees for Cities supporter. 'Everyone should have some immediate access to trees,' Lynn says. 'In this area, not everyone has a garden or access to a lot of green space. Trees make a huge difference.' Together they planted a tree under the auspices of the Leeds arm of Trees for Cities, to commemorate Jill's father, Harry. 'I was a bit scared it would be vandalised, but so far it's been left alone.' </p> <p>In the late Nineties, environmental activism was all about staring down JCBs and tree sit-ins. But where are the tree-sitters now? Where is our latter-day Julia Butterfly Hill (the US environmental campaigner who occupied a threatened California Redwood for 738 days from December 1997 to December 1999)? Today's tree protester is out there acquiring land by hook or by crook, and peers to plant it via Facebook. One such quiet campaigner is Adam Gretton, 31, who works in media sales by day and in every other waking moment runs the More Trees for Bath and northeast Somerset campaign. In response to the 21,000 houses that are going to be built across Bath and northeast Somerset, he is determined to plant a commensurate number of trees. Coming up to this first planting season, he and his 200-strong group will plant copses of saplings on land loaned from Bath City farm, bought with a \u00a3600 grant from phone company O2. </p> <p>'I don't know why I got into this,' he says, 'but out of four boys, three of us are obsessed with trees. Two of my brothers have become tree surgeons. It's funny, I don't remember my parents being particularly into trees.' </p> <p>The battle continues in the east. The walls of Epping Forest District Council's environmental planning office are covered with whiteboards cataloguing all manner of allegations and counter-allegations against tree roots pushing up lintels and cracking pavements. It is landscape officer Chris Neilan's role to mediate in hundreds of these claims. 'A while ago I was talking to someone who worked for one of the main arboreal contractors to the insurance industry, and he said that for every tree I saved there were dozens being felled that I would never even know about,' he says. Doesn't that really upset you, I ask. 'Oh no,' he says, 'it just makes me think I have to work even harder.'</p> <p>Which is one reason why Neilan spent months devising a system for valuing tree stock, rather than merely emphasising how much trees cost to be maintained or protected ('which was all anybody ever seemed to talk about'). His formula, the Capital Asset Value for Amenity Trees system (Cavat), calculates an approximate value of trees based on the size of the trunk, height, condition and the number of people the tree serves. In essence it's a means of recognising a tree's worth as a true amenity. 'Sometimes you do get people who are trying to save trees that are pretty well, er ... dead,' he concedes. 'But mostly people are just standing up for important assets in their community. Eventually the Cavat system can contribute to sorting out tree root subsidence claims more quickly and fairly.' </p> <p>His idea has been adopted by the London Tree Officers Association. Admittedly there is some way to go, but Cavat could help to usher in a new era, whereby trees are managed as public assets rather than liabilities. Arguably the value of trees has for too long - by fans and detractors alike - been attributed to some quasi-spiritual concept. It is time to stop hugging them and put a cold, hard, currency value on the nation's most precious trees. </p> <p>I don't imagine many of the guests at the traditional end-of-summer Berkeley Square ball, just a few weeks ago, noticed the imposing Victorian beauty behind the marquee. But Britain's most well-heeled tree, valued by Chris Neilan's Cavat technique at a cool \u00a3750,000, on account of its age, impressive stature and influence, was arguably a bigger celebrity than many of the guests. It arguably offered greater value for money on a number of levels.</p>",
  "<p>It was a week when confidence in shares, markets and capitalism itself was shaken to the core as stock prices fell more sharply than at any time since the Great Depression. </p> <p>'Utter carnage' is how one trader described events as he caught the train home from Canary Wharf on Friday. More than \u00a3600bn has been wiped from the value of shares of companies listed on the FTSE 100 since it climbed to 6,732 on 15 June 2007.</p> <p>Now the index is trading at around 4,000, a 40 per cent slump in 12 months, with about half of that recorded since the first week of September. That will have a big impact on the value of pensions. In the City, Mark Otswald, an analyst at Monument Securities, describes the last few days as 'sheer, bloody panic. The Western financial system is breaking down.'</p> <p>Apocalypse now? 'Let's hope not,' says Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered bank who believes that an economic catastrophe can be averted and confidence restored. 'But the authorities need to take swift, decisive action if we are to avoid a sharp, global recession.'</p> <p>The frightening thing is that markets continued to fall after rescue packages were unveiled, first in the US and then this week in the UK. </p> <p>The view from experts is that the shares sell-off reflects the belief that a global slump cannot be avoided, whatever individual governments might do. Ben Read at the Centre for Economic and Business Research says global, co-ordinated action from the authorities is urgent, and on a much larger scale than hitherto. 'At the moment, the mood is unforgiving and the herd mentality is kicking in,' he says. 'People are selling shares to raise cash because no one believes that anything is fairly valued. And they don't know how bad things are going to get, so the temptation is to dump assets, no matter what.'</p> <p>Economists broadly welcomed the British government's bailout plan announced earlier this week, which could be a template for other countries, including the US. 'Part of the reason behind the sell-off in Wall Street is that investors don't believe that Congress's $700bn rescue package is sufficient,' says Read. 'But it will take time for any counter-measure, even the British one, to work through the system.'</p> <p>On one level, it seems that whatever the authorities do simply isn't enough. The first priority is to free up the money markets where banks lend to each other to ensure there is sufficient credit around to lend to businesses and mortgage borrowers. Ominously, that isn't happening, and the inter-bank lending rate is still several points above the base rate. Where banks are lending to corporate customers, it comes at a price, with many firms preferring to put expansion plans on hold. </p> <p>David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, says: 'The big issues for us are the cost of borrowing, the fact that banks are asking for more collateral before they agree to lend, and the length of time it is taking for loans to be approved. Companies are being squeezed and capital expenditure will be cut.' </p> <p>Russell Griggs, chairman of the CBI's Small and Medium Enterprise Council, is even more downbeat: 'The majority of companies are saying it's challenging or impossible to get credit,' he says. Last week, the council met for the first time since August: 'The level of concern has risen considerably since then.' </p> <p>Many businesses are already low on cash because of higher costs - such as fuel bills - and weakening consumer demand. But banks have almost stopped making loans to companies, particularly start-ups or those looking to expand. Steve Sharratt, SME vice-chairman, says: 'The really scary thing is that banks have shut up shop.'</p> <p>In addition, firms report that banks are asking for the renegotiation of some existing loans. Sharratt says one company with a turnover of \u00a31.5m went bust this month after its bank reduced its overdraft from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a325,000, giving it 10 days' notice. The bank also charged \u00a335,000 in fees. Derek Simpson, general secretary of the Unite union, says: 'The banks are trying to hoard cash and squeezing everyone down the chain.'</p> <p>But many other factors are affecting the markets. The expiry of the ban on short-selling has surely exacerbated the turmoil. Also, retail investors are dumping equities in favour of cash. In September, there was a net outflow of $72bn from American mutual funds, and the figure for this month could be even higher. </p> <p>In Britain, retail investors have held their nerve, although there was a \u00a3500m outflow in August. But hedge funds are major sellers. That is happening for one of two reasons: either because banks are making margin calls, where they ask for more security as debt becomes dearer to service, or because investors are taking fright and cashing in their chips.</p> <p>One industry executive says: 'Hedge funds are being flooded by calls from stakeholders looking to redeem their holdings. I think quite a few are going to struggle to survive.'</p> <p>Rich individuals, including Russian oligarchs, are also selling, in particular where loans are secured against equity stakes in companies under their control. As stock prices fall, banks are demanding more security from tycoons, many of whom have tied up their wealth in shares. </p> <p>Ukrainian oligarch and iron ore miner Kostyantin Zhevago was forced to sell a 20 per cent stake in metal company Ferrexpo last week because of the steep fall in the price of commodities. Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska has sold 20 per cent of Canadian car parts maker Magna and is 'relinquishing' his 10 per cent stake in Hochtief, the German construction group.</p> <p>Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea football club, is reported to have lost \u00a312bn in companies listed on the Moscow stockmarket. Arsenal stakeholder Alisher Usmanov has also lost money, sparking rumours that he could offload his shares in the north London club, although he has denied this in the past.</p> <p>When the world's wealthy elites are forced to sell shares, it not only adds to the downward pressure on financial markets, but also takes spending power out of the economy, with spin-off effects for sectors as diverse as luxury goods, property and investment in jobs. </p> <p>The Depression of 80 years ago was compounded by the fact that wealth was controlled by an even narrower spectrum of society than today; the effect of wealth destruction for a few was felt disproportionately by the rest of the population. Nevertheless, a version of that nexus exists today.</p> <p>As Friday drew to a close in the worst week on the stock markets in most living memories, worries were turning to insurers, some of whom made big investments in mortgage-backed securities. Insurance companies are also holders of stocks and bonds in financial firms that have been wiped out or damaged by the crisis. </p> <p>In the US, Prudential Financial has already warned that its quarterly profits would miss forecasts. Its rivals have seen their share prices hammered on concerns that they will need to raise capital. </p> <p>So far, in Britain, the insurance companies have escaped relatively unscathed, and fears that they might have to sell shares to increase their solvency ratios to make good a decline in equity prices appear overdone. </p> <p>In 2001-02, British insurers such as Standard Life were forced to sell equities to meet capital adequacy requirements, but today insurers are less vulnerable. That is because, over the years, they have cut their exposure to shares from around 70 per cent of their portfolio to 40 per cent or less, in favour of bonds and other assets. Last week, Aviva, owner of Norwich Union, said it had more than sufficient surplus regulatory capital. Nevertheless, rumours abound that some players have been trimming their shareholdings as the gloom continues.</p> <p>Of more concern are the potential liabilities hanging over credit default swaps, a huge unregulated sector that few people know about or understand. Over the last 12 years, the value of the CDS market, where these contracts are traded like other derivatives, has grown to $55 trillion. CDSs have been used to insure risky mortgage bonds, as well as the debt of collapsed institutions such as Lehman Brothers. The worry is that insurers and banks that underwrote these instruments will not be able to meet their liabilities.</p> <p>With judgement, and perhaps a little luck, the financial crisis that has enveloped the world can be brought under control via a global rescue plan, but the aftershock will almost certainly be with us for years to come.</p>",
  "<p>They are young, confident, affluent and have no memory of tougher times. But Generation Y now faces its first recession and a future very different to the one it expected. Aged from 18 to 27 and mostly middle-class, these young people have grown up in owner-occupied homes with total acceptance of technology, global warming and homeland terrorism - and their love of shopping has made them dream consumers. But, sooner or later, their lives are going to change.</p> <p>The average Generation Y-er does not know the difference between a credit card and a debit card, according to a Bank of Scotland survey, and, while two thirds know the price of an Apple iPod Mini (\u00a3179), three quarters have no idea what a pint of milk costs. One in eight thinks that 'in the red' means being embarrassed. They each have 800 illegally downloaded songs, and one in 20 spends more than \u00a3100 a month on mobile phone bills. Many never read newspapers and two thirds do not vote.</p> <p>They like to shop and, whether its Topshop, Primark or TK Maxx designer labels, they are used to getting what they want in a high street catering to almost every income level.</p> <p>If the credit crunch becomes a full-scale recession, no one will get a bigger shock to their aspirations than this pampered, techno-savvy generation.</p> <p>'They will be at the sharp end because that age is always at the sharp end of social change. They are trying to enter the adult world anyway, struggling with expectations and views that aren't theirs,' said Jon Savage, a music writer and author of Teenage: The Creation of Youth. 'But my question is: what are they going to do if they can't shop? Our society has been based around consumerism for the past 15 years and these kids have racks of CDs and plasma TVs and comparatively unparalleled riches.'</p> <p>At Birmingham University this weekend, The Observer gathered a group of first-year students - at the heart of Generation Y - to ask what the credit crunch meant to them. For many, the answer was 'not much'.</p> <p>'The credit crunch doesn't really affect me,' said Lauren Ludlow, a 20-year-old studying art history, one of the non-career-based subjects that traditionally slip in popularity in economic downturns. 'I'm more concerned for my parents and I'm just hoping it'll all have sorted itself out in three or four years' time.'</p> <p>Law student Jess Darley, 19, from Ipswich, added: 'I don't think it's been too over-hyped or anything, but young people don't really understand economics because we're not taught about it. I guess it probably does affect us, but it sort of feels irrelevant.' </p> <p>Some are cushioned by 'helicopter' parents - hovering protectively over their offspring. Amy Perry, 18, from Telford, said: 'My mum does most of my food shopping for me. I guess it will get more expensive for her for a while, though.'</p> <p>Few are fearful. They're just not that bothered. 'It doesn't mean much to me at all,' admitted Joe Griffiths, 19, from Southampton.</p> <p>Perhaps they are right not to worry. According to Dr David Twigg, a business lecturer at the University of Sussex, today's group of students are far more prepared for a difficult job market. </p> <p>'Anyone born after 1983 is not really used to considering anything other than wealth, but students are much more determined to build up a broad skill base; they'll work hard to get it and demand we provide the teaching,' he said. 'They will be successful no matter what; they are independent self-learners who are better equipped than any previous generation.'</p> <p>And while recessions inevitably bring financial strain, they are also known to inspire creativity. 'The last big recession produced punk, which was great,' said Savage, but he added that it was not all positive. 'You had to have a lot of bravery to be part of that and the Seventies also produced political polarisation and extremism, perhaps an easier option.</p> <p>'In the Thirties, the Great Depression brought that kind of increased regimentation by the state. When you're of Generation Y age, you are fairly open to becoming extremely obsessed with an idea, and you feel invulnerable and you don't have much idea of the consequences of your actions. It can be a dangerous mix.'</p> <p>Few organisations in education and the arts were prepared to talk about the future other than to fret that funding drops in a recession. One west London art gallery owner told The Observer: 'This stuff about kids getting creative in a recession is rot. It's not the Seventies; they have seen Damien Hirst and Banksy make millions and that's what Generation Y want, the same as Generation X - money. If they can't get it in art, they'll go and be eco-bankers.'</p> <p>Back in Birmingham, Paula, 19, (who didn't want to give her full name) said she was concerned about the impact of the credit crunch on her and her friends. 'The recession is having an influence that many of us fail to recognise. Food prices are increasing, while loans remain at the same rate. Student expenditure is on a constant rise and, if the recession continues, paying bank loans may mean a huge increase in interest. Many students have not even considered this; it needs to be more widely publicised.'</p> <p>The Consumer Credit Counselling Service has long had concerns over students being unable to manage their finances. In the past two years, it has seen a 10-fold increase in calls from 18- to 21-year-olds to its helpline. </p> <p>Others point to housing and warn that Generation Y will be one of the hardest hit. Adam Sampson, chief executive of the homeless charity Shelter, said lower prices wouldn't help because there would be fewer mortgages: 'These young people don't trust pensions any more and believe as much in house-as-security as their parents, who got us into this situation. But these kids have far less chance of getting on the ladder,' he said.</p> <p>'We have 240,000 new households forming every year and no one is building houses for them. They haven't been building enough for 20 years and that's some backlog. The recession will make that worse, as builders won't get money from the banks to build. I'm afraid Generation Y will be at home with mum and dad and we'll see the hidden homeless issue - overcrowding - get worse.'</p> <p>Charlotte Paul has two boys - Marcus, 14, and Charlie, 16 - and lives with her husband and his 22-year-old daughter in Yorkshire. 'My step-daughter was hoping to move into her own flat this year, but the mortgages weren't there, so she's squashed in here. It's been a shock to her because it's the first time in her life she has not been able to get something she wanted. She's just that age group; they've never been told, \"No, you can't have\",' said Mrs Paul. 'Now she wants to give up her job and go volunteering abroad for a year and she has no fear of coming back to no job. I envy her confidence.' </p> <p>For her boys, Mrs Paul is thinking the previously unthinkable. 'We've an endowment policy we kept to pay out in time for Charlie's second year at university and for Marcus we'd downsize the house and get Charlie on to the housing ladder at the same time. That's gone to pot. 'Charlie doesn't like the idea of university. I went to university to duck out of the last recession - there were grants and it kept me off the dole. Maybe not going will help him duck the debt and get experience.' Then, Mrs Paul stopped herself: 'I can't believe I'm thinking like this.'</p> <p>At business consultants Talent-smoothie, Simon Walker has spent a lot of time explaining the confident behaviour of Generation Y to perplexed employers. 'Will Generation Y behave differently now things aren't so rosy? Well, of course they will,' he said. </p> <p>'They are very different from other generations and have only known very buoyant times. They demand things like flexible working and expect to get it. Past generations turned up on their first day in a suit and tie and did what they were told, but that's changed and you cannot reverse that. We were approached by a company that had 50 per cent of the workforce who were Generation Y and they were worried that their inexperience with a downturn would lead to absenteeism and extra stress. But we haven't found that yet at all - they adapt. But then, at the moment, people are not losing their jobs.'</p> <p>When that happens, few believe things won't change, particularly on the high street. </p> <p>Robert Clarke, of business analysts Retail Knowledge Bank, argued that the high-profile reporting of the crisis would soon have an impact. 'We're getting it hour by hour, and that brings problems in itself,' he said. 'Consumer confidence is hugely important and people who are getting ahead of themselves to preach doom and gloom are deeply irresponsible. A mindset will take us into recession faster than any bank collapse. Retail sales figures have not started falling yet. The likelihood is that the high street next year will look different for young people; there will be a few empty shops.'</p> <p>However, according to Clarke, it is not all bad news: 'The optimism of Generation Y is correct, because the likelihood is that most people will continue to be employed and will continue to be able to clothe and feed themselves. </p> <p>'Yes, there will be fewer Saturday jobs and part-time jobs in retailing, which will affect the 75 per cent of university students who have part-time jobs, but they won't have mortgages, rents will be cheaper and I think they will still have money in their pockets.'</p> <h2>Recession silver linings</h2> <p><strong>Petrol prices are dropping and there are bargains to be had if you need to buy a car.</strong></p> <p>There is a boom in people growing their own vegetables and inner-city allotments are thriving. </p> <p><strong>Recession is a great time for live music, exciting new trends and it's cool to wear charity shop clothes. </strong></p> <p>Hollywood churns out great-quality feelgood movies. </p> <p><strong>We will all spend more time with our families - even the grown-up children will be hanging around the house.</strong></p> <p>Safe manufacturers have seen a 50 per cent rise in sales and bicycle shops are doing well too.</p> <p><strong>Some of the fat cats actually went down first.</strong></p> <p>People may use their cars less and shop less and more locally which is good for the environment.</p> <p><strong>We may all get a little less materialistic and a little more imaginative this Christmas.</strong></p> <p>Getting close to nature - people may spend more time enjoying walks in the country or camping holidays </p> <p><strong>People will tire of watching reality television, according to one study, because they will be dealing 'with enough reality' in everyday life</strong></p> <h2>Sign up now for Guardian event, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/thedebtdebate\">The Debt Debate</a>, an in-depth look at financial education and advice</h2>",
  "<h2>Break of fawn</h2> <p>At a Clarence House gathering last week to brief journalists about Charles and Camilla's forthcoming trip to Japan, BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell was as hostile as one of the Queen's corgis, yapping at the heels of HRH's press spokesman with commendable persistence. Could this have anything to do with the fact that Witchell's esteemed colleague, Jeremy Paxman, had criticised the corporation that very day for its 'fawning' Royal coverage? </p> <h2>Esther's clunking fist</h2> <p>'I am going to tell you a secret,' writes talented young Independent journalist Esther Walker. 'It is one all women - but only a handful of men - know. It is this: most men are awful. And I mean awful: lazy, tedious, defensive, chippy, selfish, patronising, ignorant, insensitive donks, box-fresh from the Planet Clunk.' Walker steps out with Times columnist and TV star Giles Coren, who presumably defies this stereotype. </p> <h2>A taste for Pym's </h2> <p>The BBC's amiable, and capable, economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, is the forgotten man of the credit crunch. He has been standing in for BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders, who is currently on maternity leave, but has too often found himself standing in the shadows, while business editor Robert Peston hogs the limelight. So it's heartening to learn that BBC director-general Mark Thompson has singled out Pym for special praise, along with a few colleagues, in an email to staff. 'I've been ... impressed by the way Robert [Peston], Greg Wood, Hugh Pym and so many other reporters ... have been making sense of the story and putting it in context ... in incredibly fast-moving circumstances,' he wrote. Amen to that. </p> <h2>Quentin lets rip</h2> <p>Foppish Daily Mail sketch writer Quentin Letts has a pop at the man who runs his old paper in the current edition of Cond\u00e9 Nast's upmarket glossy Tatler. 'I'm not sure I've caused enough controversy. Why don't we say Will Lewis has been a total disaster as the editor of the Daily Telegraph?' he tells interviewer David Jenkins, conveniently ignoring the fact that Lewis has dragged the paper into the 21st century. 'That's probably wrecked any chance I have of working for the Telegraph again.' Quite.</p> <h2>Bull, says Kelvin</h2> <p>Anatole 'It'll all be fine' Kaletsky, the Times's principal economic commentator and an associate editor, has been bullish about the stock market for years - until now. With the global financial system in meltdown, he has sensibly changed his view, a fact which former Sun editor (and fellow News International employee) Kelvin Mackenzie, noted with relish last week. He used his Sun column to declare that while he (Kelvin) had accurately predicted the demise of Bradford &amp; Bingley, Kaletsky has had 'a shocking war'. Over to you, Anatole.</p> <h2>Bless the McBride </h2> <p>Strange to see PR Week placing Gordon Brown's former press man, Damian McBride, bottom of a list of political spinners. Even the Mail on Sunday's political correspondent, Ben Brogan, hardly a natural supporter, wrote on his blog: 'When the Day of Reckoning comes and those of us who know are free to say what we know, Damian McBride will emerge with great credit from the madness of the past few years.'</p>",
  "<p>Ah, October. A month for cranking up the central heating, pulling on your best knitwear and gazing... no, not at the burnished, falling leaves, but at the great piles of celebrity books that, seemingly overnight, have appeared in your local bookshop. I wandered into mine and it was like walking into the green room backstage at the Baftas, only with the obvious advantage that the famous names staring up at me could not actually speak. </p> <p>To my right was Dawn French, smiling out from beneath her maroon fringe on the cover of <strong>Dear Fatty</strong> (Century \u00a318.99). To my left was Julie Walters, author of <strong>That's Another Story</strong> (Weidenfeld \u00a318.99), resplendent in pearlised lipstick. Also much in evidence: Michael Parkinson, Sheila Hancock, Paul O'Grady and Bill Oddie. And those are just the big beasts. This festive season, you will also be able to buy <strong>Wild Boy</strong> by Andy Taylor (Orion \u00a318.99), formerly the guitarist in Duran Duran, <strong>Just Biggins</strong> by Christopher Biggins (John Blake \u00a318.99) and <strong>All Balls and Glitter - My Life</strong> by Craig Revel Horwood (Michael O'Mara \u00a318.99), a judge on Strictly Come Dancing. Biggins's book, for the record, misses out on this year's award for Most Smug Celebrity Title; this must go to Sheila Hancock for Just Me (just me... just little old me... just me, me, me). He does, however, walk away with the 2008 prize for Campest Showbusiness Photograph, which I am awarding to the picture, reproduced on page 114, of Christopher with Stefanie Powers, Ned Sherrin, Michael Ball and Dame Vera Lynn.</p> <p>Why do celebrities write books? For the cheque, of course. There can't be any other reason, given that most of them don't actually write their books at all, but simply yak to a long-suffering ghost writer. As for their publishers, these titles are nothing more or less than a gamble. Though most will not turn much of a profit, the evidence of recent years suggests that at least one will be among the 10 biggest-selling books of the year. </p> <p>In 2005, Sharon Osbourne's autobiography, Extreme, was the surprise hit; in 2006, Peter Kay's The Sound of Laughter sold 600,000 copies; and in 2007 we went suitably wild for Russell Brand's My Booky Wook. Unfortunately, predicting which celebrity will do well is like trying to guess what the weather will be like two weeks on Tuesday, which is why most of these books are published as fast and as cheaply as possible (the worst don't even have an index). Thereafter, their editors must simply settle down to a waiting game. The whole thing must be a bit like taking your pedigree bitch (or mongrel, in most cases) to be inseminated. </p> <p>Take this year's comics: will it be the cuddly Alan Carr that the public cleaves to its maternal bosom or his waspish rival Paul O'Grady? My money is on O'Grady, largely because Carr is only 32 and should not yet be in the business of writing an autobiography. Then again, O'Grady's prose is often deadly: 'I was able to study Selfridges windows in peace... I stood there for a good half-hour, amazed by the detail in the incredible costumes...' Worse, he has ended his book at a point before he became famous. And before he was famous, he worked in a social security office in Bootle where he often had to be disciplined for... <em>talking too much</em>.</p> <p>I know more than I would like about celebrity books because I once ghosted one. All I'll say here about that experience is that the money paid for my basement to be damp-proofed, and while the memory of listening to my subject describe his boyhood has long since faded, my kitchen is still bone dry; I guess it was a good deal. Even so, once you've written such a thing, you know not to expect too much from the genre. Brilliant, gossipy, hilarious memoirs like The Kid Stays in the Picture by producer Robert Evans come along but once a decade; the rest of the time, the ghost or, God forbid, the celebrity himself, is grossly overextending what might have made a perfectly good 3,000-word magazine profile. They have no option but to tell you <em>everything</em>.</p> <p>Lorraine Kelly's book has a title - <strong>Between You and Me</strong> (Headline \u00a318.99) - that suggests a certain racy indiscretion. If only. Among other things, she reveals that, in 1986, she was excited to be given a car phone 'which was \"mobile\" in the sense that you could remove it from the vehicle and carry it around'.</p> <p>It can be a (vaguely) good sign if a celebrity has not used a ghost; Russell Brand famously dispensed with the services of his and the result is at least authentically Brandian. But while a famous person who wants to write rather than simply spill their guts is a good concept, it is not always a pleasant reality. Famous people have giant egos. The idea that they might not be able to write is entirely alien to them; they can do anything! </p> <p>Nor are they going to be happy to be edited. Dear Fatty, by Dawn French, is a case in point. It's written as a series of letters, mostly to her father: 'Dear Dad. So, you're still dead.' Occasionally, she goes off-piste and writes to Madonna and the result is so awful it should be illegal: 'Dear Madonna. The news is just comin' into my ears and eyes from reliable sauces like the mag what is In Heat that you might be doin' the divorcin' of the posh gangsta-style Ritchie boy.' </p> <p>Julie Walters, Sheila Hancock and Michael Parkinson have all written their own books as far as I can tell. Hancock's <strong>Just Me</strong> (Bloomsbury \u00a318.99) is a follow-up to The Two of Us, her bestseller about life with John Thaw; this one is mostly about what it's like to go on holiday alone. But none of them is much of a writer, not even Parky, the 'prize-winning journalist'. Reading <strong>Parky: My Autobiography</strong> (Hodder \u00a320) - 'Robert Mitchum was one of my great Hollywood heroes' - is like being trapped in a filing cabinet with a fantasist. You know he met these people; he's got the tapes to prove it. But he's about as insightful as the average edition of Hello!. Believe me, the bit where he reveals that Madonna has an assistant who is trained to remove bogies from her nose with a cotton bud is a high point. Only a wafer, in fact, separates him from Roger Moore, in whose <strong>My Word is My Bond</strong> (Michael O'Mara \u00a318.99) almost everyone is either 'fabulous', 'gorgeous' or both.</p> <p>I cannot, in all honesty, recommend James Caan's <strong>The Real Deal</strong> (Virgin \u00a318.99) to you (Caan is a businessman who appears on Dragons' Den; his book includes a description of how, as a young man, he became a manager at a branch of Alfred Marks employment agency). Nor can I insist that you dash out to secure a copy of <strong>Jade: Catch a Falling Star</strong> by Jade Goody (John Blake \u00a318.99), in which the reality TV show star reveals that she recovered from a miscarriage by going on a sunbed 'as I hadn't been able to use one while I was pregnant'. </p> <p>Does this mean that there is nothing at all worth reading among this year's crop? Actually, there is. As a case study of the celebrity ego, <strong>One Flew Into the Cuckoo's Egg</strong> by Bill Oddie (Hodder \u00a320) takes some beating. Oddie has an interesting story to tell - his mother was a schizophrenic who spent a large part of her life in institutions - but it is not this tale that grips. No, it's Oddie himself who gets to you. Even as he asks for your sympathy, he makes himself utterly obnoxious and irritating - and it's fascinating, in a gruesome sort of a way. His aggression, insecurity and thin-skinned self-love rise from the page like noxious, eggy fumes.</p> <p>The book is in two sections. In the first, he writes about his mother and the impact of her illness on his life. Then he moves on. After all, research has shown that of all the Oddie family, he is 'by far the most interesting and successful one!' In the second half of the book he interviews himself, at length - a process so incredibly narcissistic you feel relieved when it is interrupted by a bout of the depression from which Oddie sometimes suffers.</p> <p>Once recovered, however, he resumes the 'interview' with added gusto, growing ever more prickly at his own questions. Truly, this is a masterpiece of amour propre, the great disease of our age. I guess you could say it's a classic of its kind. Though whether you'd want to pull it out of your stocking come Christmas morning is another matter.</p> <p>\u2022 To order any of the above with free UK p&amp;p, go to <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/home.do\">observer.co.uk/bookshop</a> or call 0870 836 0885</p>",
  "<p><strong>City of Ember</strong>, made in Romania and set God knows where, also concerns a locked and sealed community in the future. In this case, we meet the sorry survivors of some holocaust who have been battened down for 200 years for their own good. Over the centuries, they've created a depressed, subterranean authoritarian state, ill-fed and ill-led by their smiling ruler, the faux-patriarchal Mayor Cole, played by Bill Murray in the manner of Baron Hard-up in a touring production of Cinderella.</p> <p>As this grim piece is essentially for children, it is left to a plucky pair of kids, Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway), son of an inventor played by Tim Robbins, and the little orphan Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan, so good in Atonement) to lead their elders out of 200 years of incarceration and back into the light. These anxious days of global warming and diminished earthly resources seem to be bringing back the pessimistic attitudes of the Cold War.</p> <p>City of Ember is co-produced by Tom Hanks.</p>",
  "<p>Bad news is generally good news for the media. At times of crisis, newspaper sales rise and more viewers tune in to television bulletins in search of information. Few stories are as dramatic, or as complicated, as the global credit crunch, which has bought the world's financial system to its knees, although this time, newspapers have not seen their year on year circulations increase. Figures released by the Audit Bureau of Circulations on Friday showed that sales of many 'quality' titles recorded monthly rises in September, but falls compared with the same month last year. </p> <p>Without the turmoil in the financial markets, however, those figures might have been far worse. The credit crunch has elevated financial news to the front pages, and turned the BBC's Robert Peston, a former Financial Times reporter, into a household name, prompting the Daily Mail to ask last week: 'Does this BBC man have too much power?' </p> <p>That probably tells us as much about journalistic envy as it does about Peston's influence, but it also demonstrates that City journalists are unique in one respect: the stories they write can move markets in a way that others rarely do. When he has referred to individual banks, Peston has been careful to stress that savers are unlikely to lose their money, and others have exercised similar restraint as the crisis has unfolded. The FT changed a front-page reference to 'the world in fear' to 'the world in turmoil' last week, as executives at the paper tried to communicate the momentous nature of the news without exaggerating its effect. </p> <p>Even Peston did not see the crash coming, however. Should City editors and economics correspondents have predicted it? </p> <p>Alex Brummer, the Daily Mail's experienced City editor, believes they should have done. He argues that, although City journalists covered the problems of some individual companies creditably, few grasped the enormity, or scale, of the situation. </p> <p>'They were slow off the mark originally,' he says, pointing out that young journalists who weren't working during the last financial crisis in the 1970s did not have the foresight to realise that a problem at one institution can quickly become a problem for all. 'That has something to do with the age profile. They've been brought up in a period of non-stop output and growth. I cut my teeth as a financial journalist in the white heat of the 1976 financial crisis, when 25 banks went under. Having lived through all of that you learned a [crisis] spreads from one institution to another and [governments] need to do something very quickly to stabilise the system.'</p> <p>Brummer's historical perspective is something only a few share. Jeff Randall, a business journalist and the Daily Telegraph's editor-at-large, has been warning about personal debt and an unsustainable housing boom for years, and others have voiced similar concerns. Yet few identified the sub-prime market, or the credit crunch, as triggers that would push the world to the brink of recession, and senior figures at the FT admit they should probably have done better in that regard. Dan B\u00f6gler, the paper's managing editor, says: 'We believed the bankers when they said derivatives were making the world safer by spreading risk. But in reality it became a game of pass the parcel and the parcel ended up in the hands of those who least understood it. We take our share of the blame for that. </p> <p>'Why didn't we spot it? Unfortunately, financial journalists - and the FT has better-trained financial journalists than others - don't really understand this stuff, and they join a long list of people that starts with bank regulators, central bank regulators and money managers.' </p> <p>Marjorie Scardino, CEO of the paper's owner, Pearson, berated the paper for failing to uncover wrongdoing at Enron; B\u00f6gler says that was unfair. 'That was fraud. Enron was hiding stuff from everyone.' This time Scardino has stayed silent, but some of the criticism aimed at the financial press may be justified. </p> <p>B\u00f6gler adds that there were dissenting voices, including some on the FT. Gillian Tett, its capital markets editor, had been warning about the credit markets for 'at least a year' before the crisis, he points out, and the paper's influential Lex column wrote regularly about over-priced assets. Martin Dickson, the FT's deputy editor, points out that 'no one in the media - or indeed banking and government - may have anticipated the full depths of this crisis, but FT readers were warned long in advance about the serious imbalances in the financial system. Tett was ringing alarm bells months before the rest of the press caught up'. </p> <p>B\u00f6gler claims that since the financial system began to unravel, its coverage has been peerless, and rivals generally agree. Brummer admires Tett's coverage. 'She has got to grips with some of the technical stuff, the mechanical background.' </p> <p>The Sun's business editor, Ian King, who will shortly move to the Times, says: 'I think the coverage has been absolutely terrific. On papers like our own it's a particular challenge because financial news is often baffling for the lay reader.' He points out that eight out of 10 City analysts were still issuing 'buy' notes on Northern Rock the day before it collapsed, and only one was recommending their clients sell shares in the bank. 'Experts didn't see it coming.' </p> <p>King has had triumphs of his own, calling for co-ordinated interest rate cuts to avert a depression the day before central banks around the world did just that, but he points out that the global nature of the crisis, and the fact markets are always open somewhere in the world, has presented news organisations with a problem and an opportunity. </p> <p>The printed products have often looked out of date by the time they hit the streets, but websites have come into their own. The FT's Dickson points out: 'The credit crisis has given a tremendous boost to our circulation and our website viewing figures. We have seen double-digit jumps in global retail sales in recent weeks while FT.com page views have risen by 300 per cent and unique users by 250 per cent. Why? We are a global newspaper and this is a global crisis.' </p> <p>In the mainstream press, business journalists are enjoying their moment in the spotlight, but there is also an acceptance that too many are obsessed with the day-to-day grind of financial reporting, obsessing about corporate takeovers or reporting company results. </p> <p>As the only voices within papers explaining the financial world to colleagues who don't understand it, City editors can also become unwitting cheerleaders for the Square Mile. </p> <p>Brummer says that too many financial journalists are bamboozled by the 'manipulative' PR operations of big companies, and some are too fearful that they will lose access if they are too critical. 'The duty of a journalist is always to be sceptical. But they are up against very powerful institutions who lie and cheat.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on October 19 2008.

  "<p>Speaking up for trust in recent years has been about as thankless as hippy Neil's exhortation of 'peace and love, man' against the brutal realpolitik of Vivian in The Young Ones. The latter has all the good lines, and if they don't work, a swift head butt will finish the argument. In the same way, what weight does namby-pamby trust carry against the arguments of self-interest and the knockout blow of Loadsamoney?</p> <p>We now know the answer. As today's banking paralysis demonstrates, trust is something business can't do without. It isn't some fuzzy nice-to-have; it's the lubricant without which the City and Wall Street are as frozen as a rusted motor.</p> <p>If there is debt or credit, there has to be trust. It doesn't have to be personal, or even direct: when you use a card to buy a meal in a restaurant, it's not you the restaurant is trusting, it's HSBC or American Express, which will do nicely. </p> <p>Just how important this impersonal or institutionalised trust has become is described by Paul Seabright in his book The Company of Strangers. When you buy something as simple as a shirt, he says, you are the final node in a global trust network straddling a dozen countries, the whole chain dependent on confidence among all the other nodes that their unseen customer or supplier on the other side of the world will keep their side of the bargain. According to one estimate, in developed economies all but a tiny proportion of GDP is ultimately attributable to trust.</p> <p>As Seabright's example hints, historically business and trade were considered a civilising influence on humanity. Trust is a kind of moral leverage. Making trade (and wealth) rather than war required people to be honest, respect contracts and collaborate readily with strangers - all essential elements in the 'commercial syndrome' of behaviours identified by Jane Jacobs in her masterly investigation of the moral roots of business and politics, Systems of Survival</p> <p>Alas, few people advance the doux commerce thesis these days. Rather the reverse: the City and Wall Street have become bywords for selfishness and greed; not for nothing was the book about an earlier outbreak of insider greed, the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1990, entitled Barbarians at the Gate. Trust may be crucial, but is also extremely hard to manage. As the present crisis graphically shows, too much is as bad as too little, a succinct description of today's situation being that investors have gone from trusting anybody to trusting nobody almost overnight.</p> <p>The institution of management bears much of the responsibility for this debacle, having eagerly adopted a model that encourages managers to maximise short-term profits (and their own pay packets) at the expense of the greater good. This doctrine enshrines suspicion and lack of trust at its heart, and deliberately declines any concern with morality. By this means managers have indeed enriched themselves, but at the expense of wholesale loss of their own trust and legitimacy, which has come back to bite them. Company executives have not only forfeited the trust of their own employees and society as a whole - they don't even trust each other.</p> <p>This is serious. Not surprisingly, and rightly, regulation is in the air. New rules will inevitably come, but it is not inevitable that they will have the effect intended. Consider Sarbanes-Oxley (Sox), the US legislation hastily passed after the Enron and WorldCom scandals in 2002. Sox is now thought in many quarters to have been a disaster, increasing frictional costs and bureaucracy and providing a field day for legal and accountancy firms, without changing the behaviour which causes the problems. Witness Northern Rock, AIG and Lehman: they may not have committed legal offences, but in their excessive short-termism they are Enron's spiritual heirs.</p> <p>If son of Sox can't prevent the emergence of another generation of Enrons in a decade's time, what can? One radical answer is put forward in the October issue of Harvard Business Review. Two prominent Harvard professors, Rakesh Khurana and Nitin Nohria, argue that to repair managers' shattered legitimacy, 'business leaders must embrace a way of looking at their role that goes beyond their responsibility to the shareholder to include a civic and personal commitment to their duty as institutional custodians. In other words, it is time management became a true profession'.</p> <p>Unlike doctors and lawyers, they say, managers 'don't need a formal education, let alone a licence, to practise. Neither do they adhere to a universal, enforceable code of conduct'. They think managers should have to swear a version of the Hippocratic oath, a rigorous code of ethics covering personal conduct and responsibilities to society. Controversial? Certainly. But unless managers urgently find ways to restore society's broken trust, they will find their legitimate jobs hemmed in by much tighter restrictions - and have only themselves to blame.</p>",
  "<h2>Looking for protection? Put your money in condoms</h2> <p>After a week when the FTSE 100 lost a staggering fifth of its value, you wouldn't be blamed if you didn't want to touch the stock market with a barge pole. For those brave souls prepared to try their luck, caution is certainly the order of the day. Which is why, fittingly, in a market where investors are looking for any kind of protection from the global financial meltdown, you could do worse than SSL International, the maker of Durex condoms. It also makes shoe insoles, sandals and personal products like anti-headlice lotion and sells in over 100 countries. The world may be entering the worst downturn since the Depression of the Thirties, but people will still get smelly feet, nits and want to - well, you know. </p> <h2>Still hiring amid the firings</h2> <p>As the banking contagion spreads into the rest of the economy, unemployment is starting to mount, which isn't good news for recruitment consultants. But last week, Michael Page International reported a surprisingly healthy set of figures for the third quarter. Chief executive Steve Ingham had to defend his decision to rebuff a takeover approach over the summer from rival Adecco worth about 400p a share. He insisted that the company, which has offices in 28 countries, is well placed to ride out the storm. However, as firms tighten their belts, recruiting new employees is the last thing on their minds. </p> <p>Michael Page shares closed at 202.25p on Friday. Ouch. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, Steve. </p> <h2>Oil on troubled waters</h2> <p>Oil prices fell on Friday to below $80 per barrel, a one-year low. But analysts expect Opec to cut production at its next meeting in December, if not before. Oil majors like Shell have also sunk billions of dollars into expensive projects like oil sands and giant deep-water platforms. If oil prices keep falling, such costly investment will be scaled back. Together with Opec's cuts, this makes it unlikely prices will fall much further. Over the longer term, global supplies remain extremely tight. Time to fill up with oil shares?</p>",
  "<p>The moral and ethical vacuum in football has reached a critical low as worrying, if nowhere near as monumental, as the wider malaise infecting banks and stock exchanges across the world. One man's story summed it up this week. </p> <p>John Michael Nchekwube Obinna is a footballer whose name has proved as problematic as his transfers since he moved to Europe from Nigeria three years ago. Better known to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea\">Chelsea</a> fans as Mikel John Obi, and to various others from Cape Town to Scandinavia as John Obi Mikel, or even John Mikel Obi, the midfielder found himself back in the news on Friday for reasons that had nothing to do with his ability as a footballer. </p> <p>Chelsea announced they were suing the Norwegian club FC Lyn Oslo and their former chief executive Morgen Andersen for the \u00a316m they paid for Mikel in 2006 because they claim there was 'fraudulent misrepresentation that Mikel had a contract with Lyn'. They were encouraged in their High Court action by the recent criminal conviction for fraud in Norway of Andersen. </p> <p>Mikel is a small if highly paid pawn in the big game that is international football finance and his case underlines what a murky world that is. </p> <p>Once this would have shocked us. Not anymore. We almost expect it. If not Mikel and Chelsea, it is Carlos Tevez and West Ham. Next week, who knows? The game, the business, is peopled by so many scallywags, agents and deal-makers, moving with accustomed ease across all sorts of national and moral boundaries, that we are permanently waiting for the next scandal. </p> <p>How did the game get to this point? Negligence, greed, lack of accountability, a poverty of moral rigour or a collective will to set aside personal gain for the general good. The usual. </p> <p>These core issues surfaced earlier in the week in a brief but fascinating clash between Lord Triesman, the chairman of the Football Association, and Richard Scudamore, the chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a>. </p> <p>And what more appropriate surroundings for the contest than Stamford Bridge, the King's Road citadel of Roman Abramovich, that humble, orphaned son of a construction company contractor from the coldest of cold corners in Siberia and a man now ranked 15th richest in the world - the man who pays Mikel's not inconsiderable wages?</p> <p>It was here they gathered, a thousand smart men, and a few smart women, from 40 countries, to eat sandwiches and discusses matters of financial importance in the inaugural 'international business summit for leaders in football'. It was a top-class jolly. If football couldn't feel at home here, where could it? </p> <p>These were people charged with a wide range of responsibilities in the game, from ownership to administration to serial schmoozing, and they looked pretty impressed with each other. </p> <p>Triesman, an old left winger, kicked off in a rush, warning that the game in this country was \u00a33bn in the red. That, naturally, upset Scudamore on the other flank. He reckoned the good Lord should look more closely at the books. </p> <p>He was nowhere to be seen, but Comrade Abramovich, a man who knows a lot about the books, will have listened closely to both and, it would be fair to say, he would back Scudamore from now until the 12th of Never. </p> <p>So would any club owner. They are not, they would say, entrusted with looking after the general good. Their responsibility is maximising their own profits. Bankers.</p> <p>Roman's chairman, Bruce Buck, an American who has learned to love his club and his adopted country ardently since he came here 25 years ago, is an eloquent defender of Chelsea's business philosophy. Here was the flesh-and-blood contradiction of President Harry S Truman's dictum, 'The buck stops here'. </p> <p>No, he said, Chelsea had not inflated the transfer market. The club, after too long out in the cold, had done what was necessary for the good of Chelsea - which was to use their Russian owner's extraordinary bank of money to buy up as many already rich footballers as they could lay their hands on before someone else, ie Manchester United (with whom they had to battle for Mikel). What other clubs did what was up to them. </p> <p>Scudamore, meanwhile, was putting himself about like Wayne Rooney on acid. He popped up at another seminar in London on Thursday and there repeated his assertion that the clubs are as capable as any of the sport's governing bodies of looking after their affairs. He was going to take no lectures from Triesman or Fifa about governance. </p> <p>While the notion of clubs being the standard-bearers of good behaviour is fanciful, the men of Fifa are no angels. </p> <p>Professor Alan Tomlinson of Brighton University has written extensively about Fifa - most recently in 2002 in Badfellas: FIFA Family At War - and says it is right to be concerned about the game's global governing body. </p> <p>'Fifa's 1996-2007 motto,' he says, 'was \"For the good of the game\". It has now gone, replaced by, \"For the Game. For the World\". \"Authenticity, unity, performance and integrity\", its mission statement claims; fair play, tolerance, sportsmanship and transparency too. </p> <p>'But deal-making with and within its regional federations, international associations and corporate sponsors show where Fifa's ambitions and loyalties really lie. Personal aggrandisement has shaped Fifa policy as much as sporting and international ideals. </p> <p>'Its KPMG-audited accounts for 2006 declared 912m Swiss francs (\u00a3476m) income, and only 609m (\u00a3318m) expenses, Fifa's richest ever year. Yet this year a Swiss court was still investigating allegations of \u00a366m bribes. In 2007-08 the organisational watchdog One World Trust reported Fifa to be the most unaccountable international non-governmental organisations [INGO] in its world sample. \"Not for the Game. For the Fifacrats\" might be the more appropriate slogan.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, West Ham and Portsmouth are struggling financially, and Newcastle remain the best panto act in football. On Friday, Charlton embraced potential new owners from Dubai, hoping, no doubt, to become the Manchester City of the south. </p> <p>These are rollercoaster times for football. Premier League clubs, while commanding huge interest from fans and financiers around the world, are, as Triesman rightly points out, exposed to the turbulence of international money markets, yet have shown little thirst for serious self-regulation. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the 39th game is firmly back on the agenda. Fifa, Scudamore said, were an inward-looking lot, wary of globalisation because they knew it diluted the importance of national teams. And he has a point. It is difficult, under any circumstances, to put any trust in Fifa, a body that seems perennially concerned with its own importance. </p> <p>I was intrigued - for as long as I could stay awake - to hear what Mohamed bin Hammam, the president of the Asian Football Confederation, had to say in the summit's closing 'keynote address'. </p> <p>Hammam had the good grace after droning on for half an hour or so to admit he was not much of a public speaker but, at the end, he conceded there was a case to be made for the 39th game, reversing his earlier opposition. Change is on the way. Nobody can be sure where it will take us.</p>",
  "<p>More than a million Britons will be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/unemploymentdata\">out of work</a> and on the dole by next month as the toxic fallout from Black October filters down to ordinary families, economists are warning. </p> <p>A bleak Christmas lies ahead for many as the City turmoil spreads into the so-called real economy. Companies are now being squeezed on two vital fronts, with shoppers abandoning the high street and bank lending drying up, making it almost impossible for smaller businesses to get credit to stay afloat. </p> <p>Geoff Hoon, the new Transport Secretary, yesterday warned that there were 'potentially serious consequences for small business, for employment' from the current crisis, reflecting private warnings to the Prime Minister's new economic 'war cabinet' that job losses and business collapses later this year are now virtually inevitable. </p> <p>Official unemployment figures for September, due on Wednesday, are expected to show another increase in job losses - although this will not yet be the sharp upward spike which is expected as the full consequences of last week's stock-market crash filter through. Some forecasts suggest that unemployment will hit two million by Christmas. </p> <p>Some government officials warned that those slipping into unemployment could find themselves much more isolated than in the last recession. They pointed out that unemployment benefits had slipped relative to earnings and there were now fewer council houses available. </p> <p>Senior Tories this weekend called for a freeze on new employment rights, in a shift away from David Cameron's previous enthusiasm for measures like extra parental leave, arguing that the priority was to save jobs by reducing business red tape. Alan Duncan, the shadow business secretary, will host an emergency summit this week on ways of preventing small businesses from going bust.</p> <p>Chris Grayling, the shadow work and pensions secretary, told The Observer it would become 'more difficult' to make the case for flexible working in the darkening economic climate and called for deregulation to take the pressure off employers: 'The one thing government must recognise is that it can't keep piling regulation on small business when that could (determine) the decision whether to keep somebody in a job or not.'</p> <p>Ministers are now under similar pressure to defend jobs, with some Labour MPs reporting a backlash from constituents furious that billions have been spent rescuing bankers while factory workers' jobs go to the wall. </p> <p>The British Retail Consortium will release figures this week showing another fall in sales on the high street last month, with director general Stephen Robertson warning that sales for non-food retailers such as electrical stores had 'fallen off a cliff'. Some retailers are reducing opening hours to save costs. </p> <p>Shoppers are also cutting back on 'big ticket' purchases like cars, with the number of new registrations in September down by a fifth on August, according to the SMMT, the motor vehicle manufacturing body. Car plants have already axed thousands of temporary staff and put others on four-day weeks or halted overtime. 'If there is no pick-up in demand for cars, there are bound to be more job losses next year,' said Roger Madison, national automotive officer for the Unite union.</p> <p>Others at risk include the aviation industry - Willie Walsh, the British Airways chief executive, is predicting that up to 30 airlines worldwide will go bust - while further losses are likely in the City. Unemployed bankers are being advised to seek work in Shanghai or Mumbai amid warnings that the Square Mile will be permanently reshaped by the crisis.</p> <p>'City people I speak to are despairing because they may not get another job for a year,' said Shaun Springer, chief executive of the City headhunting firm Napier Scott. 'For the first time in 30 years in the City, I'm scared.'</p> <p>With charitable donations falling, even the voluntary sector is also cutting jobs. Oxfam needs to shave its budget by up to 15 per cent because of falling income, while the National Council of Voluntary Organisations expects some smaller charities to go under. </p> <p>Alan Clarke, economist from the bank BNP Paribas, said the number of those claiming unemployment benefit was due to break the one million mark by the end of next month at the latest, with up to two million looking for work by December: he is forecasting unemployment to hit 7 per cent by the middle of next year and carry on rising until 2010.</p> <p>Philip Shaw, economist at Investec, said it was difficult to be optimistic: 'The sentiment is one of widespread doom and gloom. Businesses are now being affected by the credit squeeze. The economy has shuddered to a halt.' </p> <p>At the height of the 1980s recession, three million were unemployed. The question now is how far the pain will spread. As one boss told a senior CBI official: 'We know there is a tsunami coming, but we do not know if it's going to knock us over or just wet our feet.' </p> <p>The speed with which the bubble burst is one of the most striking factors of this crisis, and could help determine what happens next. Consumer confidence is now lower on some indices than in the 1980s slump or even the mid-1970s, according to the pollster Peter Kellner, suggesting that Britons unused to tough times are quicker to panic than in previous slumps - leading to a more sudden fall in sales, and consequently a more severe immediate threat to jobs. </p> <p>'It may be that paradoxically because it's been so good for the last 16 years people are not used to the idea (of bad times) whereas in previous times the boom and bust rolled around so regularly that it was less of a shock to the system,' he argues.</p> <p>No wonder Labour MPs' celebrations after last week's banking bailout package were shortlived. 'The big picture is obviously deeply worrying,' said one Cabinet aide. 'But at least Gordon is playing a blinder: he looks so comfortable in his own skin for the first time in a long time.'</p> <p>The Prime Minister has indeed been revitalised by the crisis, his confidence visibly soaring: he trounced David Cameron at the dispatch box last week over City bonuses, and is now seeing his stance vindicated as other world leaders rush to copy his banking bailout. Finally, he is in his political element, leading international debate. Nonetheless, Labour's long-term prospects, with an election in 2010, are unclear. Brown could survive the crash, as John Major did with re-election in 1992, or be forced from office. Brown's argument today that his banking plan will reduce the pain felt by Britain will be critical. 'If there is a slight blip but nothing too serious, and Gordon is seen to have played a major role in pulling Britain through, then I'm not saying Labour will definitely win, but it's game on,' says Kellner. 'Alternatively, if it is a disaster we could have a Conservative landslide.'</p> <p>There are fears across all three parties that the British National Party may profit from rising unemployment. Grayling argues that healthy employment levels among foreign nationals have masked the loss of 250,000 jobs in the last years among British men: around half of new jobs created under Labour have gone to overseas workers. Widespread job losses among unskilled, working-class Britons could provide dangerous ammunition for extremist parties and fuel the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment. </p> <p>Unions are warning that the government must use its stake in the banks to free up lending, keeping businesses afloat and protecting jobs. Hugo Sellert, head of economic research at the online recruitment firm Monster, which has seen the number of employers recruiting fall dramatically, says the biggest fear is of business lending drying up. 'We have yet to see the full impact of the financial crisis and the recent dramatic events spill over into the jobs market,' he said. 'The worst is still to come.'</p> <p>Which would mean tough decisions not just for employers but for government. The Treasury's forecasts of a 4.8 per cent growth in tax receipts - including money raked in from corporate tax and VAT on consumer goods - now looks wildly optimistic, yet revising them would threaten its spending plans for public services. So what happens when the sums no longer add up? </p> <p>If you are reading this on a Northern Line London Tube train, you may owe your journey to the last great recession. The extension of the Tube north to High Barnet and east into Essex in the 1930s was part of a massive programme of government spending designed to save jobs in construction and stimulate the economy after the Great Depression. </p> <p>Rather than balancing its books by slashing spending or hiking taxes, could Labour try to spend its way through the recession by unleashing another era of job-creating public works? </p> <p>Rail and bus operators are usually among the first casualties of rising unemployment, as redundant commuters tear up their season tickets. But Stephen Joseph, of the Campaign for Better Transport, argued the pain could be eased now by pushing ahead with expensive projects such as Crossrail. </p> <p>'Because of commitments in the transport sector some of the downturn won't be as bad, because there is a level of spending through the recession,' he said. The last few days have, he argues, seen an outbreak of cross-party Keynesianism with even the Tory Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, warning against halting investment. Similarly, ministers are being lobbied to snap up land at bargain prices as the property market crashes and use it to build social housing, keeping construction workers in jobs.</p> <p>The prospect of a spending spree funded by borrowing worries the Tories, who fear winning the next election only to pick up the bill for what the shadow cabinet minister Michael Gove calls a 'party on David Cameron's credit card'. </p> <p>This weekend, the shadow chancellor George Osborne published an analysis suggesting that, if government borrowing rises by \u00a340 billion to plug the gap caused by a shrinking economy, government debt will rise to \u00a380 billion by next year. By 2009-10, the government could be spending more on servicing debt than on grants to schools.</p> <p>Whitehall is tightening its belt ahead of a pre-budget report this autumn expected, as one Cabinet minister admits, to be 'very tough'. The Treasury has not yet even set a date for its publication, as Alistair Darling rips up plans left outdated by the global crisis. Downing Street has identified health, education and transport as priorities to be ringfenced but the outlook for other departments in the next three-year spending round - due to be settled next summer - appears grim. </p> <p>Discussions have already begun over the Queen's Speech, ditching planned legislation that does not address bread-and-butter issues. Ironically, one of the flagship bills was intended to be James Purnell's welfare reforms, bringing in private sector firms to find work for the jobless, details of which will be published in December. </p> <p>By then, if the gloomier forecasts are right, two million Britons could be needing the newly privatised Jobcentre services - but if Brown is vindicated, the economy could have stepped back from the brink. </p> <p>For millions whose homes and livelihoods depend on his economic stewardship, he was right yesterday to say the stakes could not be higher.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday October 14 2008. The headline of this article 'Two million Britons on the dole by Christmas' did not accurately reflect the figures used in the story. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/mandelson\">Peter Mandelson</a>, the new Business Secretary, is in line for a \u00a31m pay-off and pension package from Brussels after serving just four years as Britain's European Commissioner, The Observer can reveal.</p> <p>Mandelson is eligible for a 'golden goodbye' in addition to an annual salary of \u00a3104,386 as a cabinet minister in the House of Lords, under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">EU</a>'s generous rules.</p> <p>The gold-plated deal will provoke strong criticism from Labour MPs as the credit crunch bites and as all three main parties demand curbs on bankers and City financiers. </p> <p>The EU rule book decrees that Mandelson, who left his job as Trade Commissioner last week before completing his five-year term, will be eligible for about \u00a378,000 a year for each of the next three years in 'transitional payments'. A total of \u00a3234,000 will be paid in instalments of \u00a36,500 a month until the end of 2011. It will be subject to preferential tax rates devised for EU officials.</p> <p>In addition, when Mandelson reaches 65, he can look forward to a guaranteed EU pension - based on his four-year stint in Brussels - starting at \u00a331,000 a year and rising in line with the cost of living. Pensions experts said last night that to buy an income of that size would require a fund of around \u00a3750,000.</p> <p>David Heathcoat-Amory, a Conservative member of the Commons European scrutiny committee, said Mandelson should refuse the payments. 'It is not as if he has lost his job. He is moving into a government job with a good ministerial salary. If he takes this money, it will be a very bad example from a government that is criticising severance payments and City bonuses.' </p> <p>Commission officials said the fact that Mandelson had quit before the end of his five-year term in charge of EU trade policy made 'no difference' to his entitlements. Any commissioner who has served more than three and fewer than five years can take 50 per cent of their \u00a3182,490 annual income for three years after leaving, so long as this sum and any income from new employment combined do not take their income over the level that they were earning as a commissioner. Mandelson, who rented a flat in Brussels but still owns a \u00a32m property in Regent's Park in London, can also apply to be reimbursed fully for all his removal costs.</p> <p>The EU pay-off arrangement means that Mandelson will be earning almost exactly the same as the Prime Minister: whose current salary is \u00a3189,994. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said the 'vast amount' Mandelson was earning was 'totally inappropriate'. Pay-offs for EU commissioners showed the 'massive divide between unaccountable people in power and the taxpayers who foot the bill'.</p> <p>Mark Francois, the Tories' spokesman on Europe, said: 'Not only did Gordon Brown recall Peter Mandelson to shore up his own position, but it adds insult to injury to know taxpayers will have to pay extra for the privilege.'</p> <p>The Prime Minister said 10 days ago that he wanted to recall Mandelson - who has twice resigned from cabinet posts in controversial circumstances - because he needed 'the best team' to help Britain through the global economic crisis.</p> <p>In the Lords, where he will be able to claim a secretarial allowance of up to \u00a370 a day, Mandelson will be in the company of other well remunerated former commissioners, including Lord Kinnock, who left Brussels after nine years with a transitional pay-off of about \u00a3277,000 over three years and a pension starting at \u00a363,900 from the age of 65.</p> <p>Last night a source close to Mandelson suggested he would take whatever he was entitled to, but stressed that he was unaware of the sums involved. 'Mandelson does not know what he is entitled to. This calculation has not been made by the commission. No doubt he will be informed in due course.'</p>",
  "<p>The volcanic archipelago studded off South America's Pacific coast is famous for unlikely creatures, big and small, which have evolved and thrived for millennia.</p> <p>Charles Darwin's observations on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands inspired his theory of natural selection and turned the rocky outcrops into a symbol of adaptation and survival. Flightless cormorants, giant tortoises, blue-footed boobies and marine iguanas all found a niche in the lava-scarred landscape.</p> <p>And so, for a time, did a new arrival, a sub-set of the human species: the illegal migrant worker. For decades, thousands flocked from the impoverished Ecuadorean mainland and found jobs in the tourist industry as maids, waiters, cleaners and shop assistants.</p> <p>Now, however, the migrants are vanishing - targeted in an unprecedented Ecuadorean government crackdown intended to rein in a breakneck tourism boom and save the archipelago's unique ecology. </p> <p>Record numbers of tourist developments have threatened endangered plant and animal species and prompted Unesco, the United Nations' cultural agency, to place the Gal\u00e1pagos on its 'in danger list'. The influx is expected to swell for next year's 200th anniversary of the birth of Darwin, the Victorian naturalist whose 1859 book, On the Origin of Species, revolutionised scientific attitudes and human understanding. The mockingbirds he collected on the Gal\u00e1pagos and study of its tortoises played a crucial role in his thinking.</p> <p>Two centuries later, most of the islands' species have survived human settlement, but the authorities, after repeated warnings from environmentalists, have become alarmed and decided to crack down. But only on migrant workers, not the tourists.</p> <p>Checkpoints and patrols have been set up to catch illegal residents who are then marched on to aircraft and flown 600 miles east back to the mainland, the Gal\u00e1pagos's first such human culling.</p> <p>'It is a policy to send home all those who do not have legal status or the proper documentation,' said Carlos Macias, a spokesman for Ingala, the regional planning agency. 'We are enforcing the law.'</p> <p>Dozens have been bundled on to planes in recent weeks and 1,000 have returned to the mainland in the past year. Another 2,000 have been told to leave within 12 months. If they go, the permanent human population of 30,000 will have been decimated.</p> <p>However, there are no plans to curb the soaring number of tourists - mostly well-heeled Europeans and Americans who visit for a few days - which this year is set to reach 180,000. 'Of course the tourist numbers have an environmental impact, but we cannot forfeit the economic opportunity,' said Macias.</p> <p>The idea is to maintain the bonanza but lighten its environmental footprint by scaling back ancillary activities which require imported labour - a process of weeding out the poor to make room for the rich by government, as opposed to natural, selection. Environmentalists welcomed the initiative, but worried it did not go far enough. 'The system is currently broken, or certainly strained,' said Johannah Barry, president of the Gal\u00e1pagos Conservancy, an advocacy group formerly known as the Charles Darwin Foundation. 'The problem is not so much the number of tourists as the ancillary economy that's going up around it. It makes sense to limit the strain.'</p> <p>She criticised tourist packages which offered kayaking, horse-riding, scuba diving, deep-sea fishing and other activities which disrupted the eco-system. 'You can do those things in Hawaii; there is no reason to do them in the Gal\u00e1pagos.'</p> <p>What Darwin chronicled in 1835 - a living laboratory of endemic flora and fauna whose interactions helped explain evolution - has been disrupted not so much by stomping Homo sapiens as the invasive alien species which accompanied them: goats, cats, cattle, pigs, mosquitoes, fire ants. They challenge local habitats in ways nature never intended.</p> <p>Another culprit is oil leaking from vessels - notably the tanker Jessica which ran aground in 2001 - and over-fishing. Populations of sharks and sea cucumbers, a type of scavenger slug, have fallen. Scientists at Gal\u00e1pagos National Park have called for a cap on tourists, saying it is the only way to prevent further damage.</p> <p>In the 1970s, the archipelago was a sleepy, difficult to reach collection of 13 islands scattered over 45,000 square kilometres of equatorial water. A management plan which anticipated tourist interest posited the sustainable number of annual visitors at 12,000.</p> <p>Cruise ships and charter flights rendered that a quaint estimate. Numbers increased exponentially and successive governments welcomed the dollars. Annual revenue is now estimated at $200m, a significant inflow mostly pocketed by tax-paying airlines and tour operators on the mainland.</p> <p>Last month Ecuador's Environment Minister, Marcela Agui\u00f1aga, told the Los Angeles Times there was no sign that tourism was 'oversaturated'. President Rafael Correa, an outspoken leftwinger and self-proclaimed environmentalist, has acknowledged that the Gal\u00e1pagos are at risk and is trying to shake up the notoriously cumbersome and bureaucratic local government.</p> <p>It was apparently at Correa's prompting that Unesco visited the archipelago last year and placed it on its 'danger list', a decision upheld in July. The government says it is working on a new 'tourism model' to reconcile a continued tourism boom with environmental protection. Expelling illegal migrant workers is part of the new approach.</p> <p>Upon arrival all visitors are now given identity cards to help authorities keep track of movements and departures. Most migrant workers who are obliged to leave do so under their own steam and only a minority are frogmarched to the airport, said Macias, the state official. There are an estimated 6,000 undocumented workers, a fifth of the permanent population.</p> <p>Expulsions were a bold start, but further steps were needed to protect the archipelago's ecology, said Henry Nicholls, author of Lonesome George: The Life and Loves of a Conservation Icon, which chronicles the last known survivor of a species of Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise. 'Kicking people out is one thing, but it would also be sensible to put a cap on tourist numbers and to reform the tourist industry. Neither of those decisions is easy.'</p> <p>Such concerns have not discouraged tour operators from offering deals to coincide with the bicentennial of Darwin's birth. One is offering a yacht voyage to 'recreate something of the spirit of the Beagle', the Victorian naturalist's ship, and another is offering a chance to travel with Darwin's great-great-grandson. And in a nod to Anglo Saxon drinking tastes, the Rough Guide recommends the bars on Avenida Charles Darwin, a tourist hub on Isla Santa Cruz. 'A dedicated beer-swilling following brings a good atmosphere ... you can shoot pool, sip a blue-footed booby cocktail or relax in a hammock.'</p> <p>In 2009, however, there may be fewer migrant workers to serve you.</p> <h2>The Evolution of the Galapagos</h2> <p>\u2022 The Galapagos comprises six main islands, 12 smaller ones and more than<br>40 islets.</p> <p>\u2022 The islands lie 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador, at the Equator line.</p> <p>\u2022 The five inhabited islands have a population of between 30,000 and 40,000.</p> <p>\u2022 About 800 species of molluscs have been identified in the seas around the Galapagos islands, and about a fifth of those are found only there.</p> <p>\u2022 Part of the Galapagos is a wildlife sanctuary that is home to six species of giant tortoise and two species of large lizards. </p> <p>\u2022 More than 85 different species of birds live on the islands. </p> <p>\u2022 Fray Tomas de Berlanga, the Bishop of Panama, documented the first official visit to the islands in 1535. Delegated to investigate the accounts of the barbaric actions of the Conquistadors in what is now Peru, his ship, caught in a dead calm, drifted westward in the ocean currents.</p> <p>\u2022 In 1835, Charles Darwin, left, spent six weeks studying the variety of the islands' animal life from his ship the Beagle.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> will try to broker a Europe-wide bail-out of <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/business/banking\">banks</a> today modelled on Britain's <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/politics/economy\">\u00a3500bn intervention</a>, warning that the 'stakes could not be higher' for jobs, mortgages and the future of the economy. </p> <p>The Prime Minister told The Observer that within days he would reveal how the bail-out would protect livelihoods in the UK by forcing the banks that accept government help to make money available to businesses and homeowners. One option is understood to be for the government to take seats on bank boards in return for taxpayers' cash. </p> <p>Brown said that the next few days would prove critical as the world tried to drag itself back from the financial brink after Friday's stock market panic wiped \u00a32.7 trillion off global share values. </p> <p>'The decisions that we take now will not just affect what happens in the next week or two but what happens in the next year or two,' said Brown, who flies to Paris for a meeting of eurozone ministers today. He will brief leaders from EU countries within the eurozone, from which Britain is usually excluded, on how his government's three-pronged strategy to buy stakes in banks, inject cash and kick-start lending could be copied across Europe in an unprecedented part-nationalisation of large parts of the global banking system. </p> <p>'I will say to people tomorrow that the stakes could not be higher,' he said yesterday. 'This is a moment of truth for the European economies, facing up to the challenges that are ahead.'</p> <p>Asked why, if his plan was working, the markets had crashed so spectacularly last week, the Prime Minister insisted that the British package was 'the right one', but added: 'Obviously it is going to work best if other countries are in a position to follow.'</p> <p>President George Bush pledged yesterday that the United States would follow Britain's lead by taking stakes in banks after the Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley appeared to be teetering on the brink of collapse. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, said yesterday that the banking crisis had pushed the global financial system 'to the brink of systemic meltdown'. </p> <p>Downing Street has insisted that success should not be judged by daily market movements, but all eyes will be on markets worldwide when the exchanges reopen tomorrow across Asia and Europe. The IMF warned leading indexes could fall by another 20 per cent before the crisis is over. </p> <p>Asked whether he had learnt lessons from the Great Depression, blamed on a failure by governments to respond adequately to the 1929 stock market crash, Brown said: 'I would put it more accurately that this is a failure in the banking system that has got to be corrected so that it doesn't have the major effects that people fear for the real economy. </p> <p>'I want people to know that we are doing everything we can to rectify the failures. Looking back to the lessons of the past, if you have a fundamental failure that has been exposed and you are now acting upon it, then that is the best [solution].'</p> <p>Brown also pledged to work with small businesses around the country to tackle their problems. He believes the speed with which the crisis has spread, with the banking failure in Iceland extending to hit council funding in Kent and small German savers, has underlined the way that globalisation has entwined nations' fates and made the case for international co-operation clearer.</p> <p>The Prime Minister will meet French President Nicolas Sarkozy, European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet, and European Commission President Jos\u00e9 Barroso this afternoon for talks before addressing the meeting of eurozone leaders. The Chancellor, Alistair Darling, held talks in Washington yesterday with President Bush as Treasury officials finalised details of which banks may take up the government offer of buying shares. A source said the Treasury could demand management changes in return for propping them up: 'Clearly, if you have a more significant stake, then you're going to have to think, from the point of view of protecting your interests, how you would take more control.' </p> <p>Darling said the threat from the banking crisis was 'blindingly obvious', adding: 'When people say why are you doing this for the banks, it is because it matters for everyone. It's about people's jobs, people's mortgages, people's businesses; it is about every man and woman in our country.' His words will be seen as failing to rule out wholesale nationalisation of the banks if the current proposals do not work.</p> <p>Senior Tories called for action to save jobs by limiting new employment rights and reducing red tape, in a shift away from David Cameron's support for measures such as more flexible working. </p> <p>Mark Prisk, the shadow business minister, attacked the government's decision to grant temporary and agency workers similar rights to permanent staff after 12 weeks in a job, arguing that this could be the last straw. 'This is just the wrong moment to start making things more complex and expensive. There are people out there now who if you start ratcheting up the costs of employment might just tip over the edge and start pushing more people into joblessness,' he said.</p> <p>Chris Grayling, the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said that the priority now was to save jobs: 'The fundamentals for business will be making ends meet and paying salary bills. The presumption over the next couple of years should be against new regulation and in favour of deregulation where we can.' </p> <p>Government aides, however, rejected the demands to scrap planned new employment rights. 'There is no way out of a recession by reducing people's rights at work,' declared a Downing Street source.</p>",
  "<p>In the GM crops dilemma, you propose that 'science, not fear' be the judge (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/05/gmcrops.food\">leader</a>, last week). But there is plenty of science on both sides: science in the service of corporate profit on the one hand; science in the service of human welfare on the other.</p> <p>Then you list ways that GM crops could alleviate hunger and malnutrition. Yes, in the hands of genuinely neutral scientists, they probably would. But GM is firmly in the hands of the type of people who gave us tobacco lies, asbestos lies and weapons-of-mass destruction lies - the type who sought to create wealth by genetically modifying the banks. Should we trust them when they no longer trust each other? <br><strong>Dermot Smyth</strong><br>Sheffield</p> <p>As much as I understand the sincerity of the motives of those who are against crop gene manipulation (CGM), their anxieties arise from misinformation about the science and the understanding of genetics. In most cases of genetic manipulation, particularly in the case of CGM in agriculture, scientists have done what nature has been doing for a few billion years. Most geneticists would agree that the risks of CGM in agriculture, if adequately regulated, are minimal and manageable.</p> <p>Many disagree with CGM in agriculture because of the involvement of corporations that have been aggressive in pursuing intellectual property rights or because of issues regarding 'termination seeds' which divests the control of raw materials from farmers to corporations. This is to conflate the issues of corporatisation and globalisation with CGM and hampers a necessary technology for addressing global food production and supply.<br><strong>Aamir Ahmed</strong><br>London N12</p> <p>You promote the acceptance of GM crops to save lives. This may be true in the short term. In the long term, the world needs fewer mouths to feed. Fewer mouths will make it easier to achieve each of the objectives for a more sustainable world - food, energy, fresh water, minerals. Achieving this requires political will and effective worldwide persuasion.<br><strong>John Chubb</strong><br>Cheltenham, Glos</p> <p>GM technology should not be released into the environment until proved to have no environmental and health risks. This stance is backed up by the Scottish Parliament's Health and Community Care committee report on the health impacts of GM crops, which argued that the basis for risk assessment is unsound. </p> <p>With regard to the developing world, a recent UN report found that GM crops offer no panacea to future food needs and do not increase yields.<br><strong>Brian Edwards</strong><br>Potters Bar, Herts</p> <p>The Soil Association has not misunderstood the science on the link between GM and allergic reactions, as Jay Rayner claimed (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/05/gmcrops.food\">GM focus</a>, last week). The reason we gave for the allergen risk of GM foods was the presence of the new proteins produced by the inserted genes, something no one in the scientific community would dispute.</p> <p>The association between GM and allergic reactions is so well established that basic allergen testing is one of the few specific requirements of our flimsy regulatory process. Since the inserted genes usually come from other organisms such as bacteria, the proteins they produce are often new to the human diet. More worryingly, proteins that are safe when produced in some plants can become unexpectedly toxic when produced in others.

  "<p>The world film spotlight will shine on Leicester Square on Wednesday when the Bfi London Film Festival opens with the premiere of Ron Howard's <strong>Frost/Nixon</strong>. Written by Peter Morgan and starring Michael Sheen, it is a fitting and glamorous opener for the festival.</p> <p>Danny Boyle's <strong>Slumdog Millionaire</strong>, set in India, closes events 15 days hence, with the small matter of the new Bond, <strong>Quantum of Solace</strong> debuting in between. These are all British enterprises in various ways, emphasising our industry's prominent place in global cinema. But this year, alongside the high-end offerings, there is a stirring of British activity in and around the Square. Last year's festival had little domestic product to shout about - perhaps the most successful film in the New British Cinema selection was Boy A, which last week triumphed at the Dinard Film Festival. Boy A was never released here in the UK, showing only on C4. Now, 13 new films swell that section, with others including Michael Winterbottom's <strong>Genova</strong>, Steve McQueen's <strong>Hunger</strong>, Richard Eyre's <strong>The Other Man</strong> and Terence Davies's <strong>Of Time and the City</strong></p> <p>So, can it be true that, after years of stops, starts and stutters, we are experiencing the flourishing of a new screen generation? Has the new wave of production schemes, regional film funds and a widening of the feature film talent pool finally borne fruit? </p> <p>I suppose the more crucial question remains: are any of these films any good? I came away from the Edinburgh Film Festival in June concerned that the low-budget British films on show had bleak commercial prospects. Glancing at the LFF line-up, I would say our national cinema's subject matters haven't changed much over the years - expect council estates (<strong>Shifty</strong>), criminals (<strong>Bronson</strong>), drugs (<strong>Better Things</strong>), pop music (<strong>1 2 3 4</strong> and <strong>Telstar</strong>), football and street fashion (<strong>Awaydays</strong>). Despite such familiarity, there does seem to be a renewed energy and an increased, nationwide vigour for film culture: settings for these films include the Cotswolds, South Wales, Edinburgh (Richard Jobson's <strong>New Town Killers</strong>), the Wirral, Finsbury Park and the Isle of Skye.</p> <p>Schemes such as Film London's Microwave programme, the Film Council's \u00a35m-a-year New Cinema Fund and the breath-of-fresh-air impetus supplied by WarpX, EM Media and Screen Yorkshire are all leading to an atmosphere of confidence and creativity. FilmFour has also, rather cleverly, courted established talent from the art world, a move which has resulted in Steve McQueen's admired debut and the appearance of Sam Taylor-Wood's short film <strong>Love You More</strong>. Gillian Wearing and the Wilson sisters also have feature film works in preparation.</p> <p>Lenny Crooks, who heads the Film Council's New Cinema Fund, says British film is in rude health: 'The LFF boasts a terrific line-up this year, but it's only the tip of the iceberg. We've made a concerted effort to lift stones and find talent and then get it behind the camera and working.' British film is right up there at the forefront of new world cinema. In a year when Hollywood has been hampered by a writers' strike, this is a good time for some new little triumphs to burst on to a grand, global stage. </p> <p>But there is no shortage of American talent on display, particularly from a revived indie scene. <strong>Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist</strong> should please the Juno audience, starring, as it does, Michael Cera, and director Peter Sollett showed a talent for New York tales in his sweet debut, Raising Victor Vargas. <strong>Ballast</strong>, set in the Deep South, has been attracting attention, while another Sundance favourite, <strong>Frozen River</strong>, set in the snowy north near Canada, boasts a strong performance from Melissa Leo.</p> <p>Ever-unique American directing talents are still likely to prove big festival draws: Steven Soderbergh, with <strong>Che</strong>, his four-hour-plus Che Guevara biopic; Jonathan Demme, with his wedding drama <strong>Rachel Getting Married</strong>; and Woody Allen with his summery tale of love, <strong>Vicky Cristina Barcelona</strong>. Funny how he made three films in London, none selected for the LFF, but as soon as he goes to Spain...</p> <p>\u2022 For details and availability go to <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/lff/\">bfi.org.uk/lff/</a></p>",
  "<p>Someone who sees a lot of the Prime Minister remarked to me the other day that he had not seen Gordon Brown so happy in years. The world is crashing around his ears and Mr Brown has to stop himself smiling too obviously. His chin is up. His stride has lengthened. His shoulders have straightened. He has even taken to cracking jokes, albeit of the gallows variety. When someone's mobile interrupted a speech, he chucklingly wondered 'if another bank has fallen'. Those who have spent time in conversation with him in recent days find the Prime Minister on remarkably relaxed form. He has become a fount of political aphorisms. 'An hour is a long time in politics,' he has been heard to quip, an updating of Harold Wilson's old saw, referring to both the dizzying speed of global events and the apparent reversal in his own fortunes. </p> <p>The opinion polls continue to tell a dismal story for Labour, the more sober ministers still expect to lose the next election, but Gordon Brown looks like a new man. The hunched, hunted Prime Minister of just a few weeks ago has been replaced by a confident, even swaggering figure. Which is the more amazing, of course, because what he is strutting through is mayhem in the banking system and meltdown on the stock market. I don't doubt that much of this is presentational. There was a frenzy of activity behind the scenes in the hours before he coolly announced the eye-watering \u00a3400bn rescue plan for the banks, taking the total commitment to \u00a3500bn. His face is still etched with exhaustion. But he looks contentedly knackered rather than miserably knackered. </p> <p>People at Number 10 hesitate to agree when I suggest to them that Gordon Brown is enjoying this crisis. How can they say the Prime Minister is getting a kick from events which are going to inflict great pain in the lives of so many people? But those around him don't quarrel with the suggestion that he feels that he has finally found himself as Prime Minister. </p> <p>The truth is that the leaders often do relish crises. Margaret Thatcher once confessed that she never felt more energised as Prime Minister than she was during the Falklands War. Military conflict gave her an adrenaline shot much more potent than the humdrumities of normal political life. Tony Blair was always at his most animated when he could place himself at the centre of a high drama, whether it be the death of Diana or 9/11. Mr Brown now finds himself thrust into the role of a war leader - a war for economic survival - and it has galvanised him like no other event of his premiership. </p> <p>The bank rescue scheme was the work of many minds in the Treasury, the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority and Number 10, but he gets to stamp his name on it and project himself as decisive. 'It has felt for the first time that government is actually governing,' says one Treasury official. The flaws in the plan will become apparent, but it has been widely hailed in Britain even by his political opponents and is being held up abroad as a template for other governments to copy. Labour MPs are cheering him again. They had something to celebrate for the first time in months when he casually squelched David Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions. </p> <p>In the early autumn, when his attempt at a relaunch sank without trace and Labour MPs began to go public with calls for him to be replaced, Mr Brown's closest allies began to fear that the cabinet would not need to unseat him because he would decide to quit of his own accord before it got to that. Now the plot to topple him has fizzled out. It may be revived if Labour is hammered in next spring's elections, but for the moment the rebels have sheathed their knives and the cabinet sceptics about his leadership are keeping quiet. As well as giving the Prime Minister a new sense of purpose, the crisis has also lifted the morale of his party. Though Labour's electoral successes owed quite a lot to the debt-fuelled boom years, the party is in an emotionally happier place when financiers are going bust and it can talk about skinning fat cats, taking over banks and regulating markets.</p> <p>Conversely, this huge market failure poses acute intellectual and political questions for the Tories, the instinctive champions of minimal regulation. They are palpably divided about whether to be the defenders of capitalism or to join in the cry to lynch the bankers. 'It is difficult for us. No question,' says one senior Conservative. There was an agonised discussion about Tory strategy when the shadow cabinet met last week. They concluded that they would have to remain supportive of the government for the moment for fear of being seen as opportunistic and unstatesmanlike at a time of national emergency. </p> <p>The problem for David Cameron and George Osborne is that this casts them as Little Sir Echoes, reduced to supporting the government from the sidelines. Where Gordon Brown has struggled with many of the other demands of being a modern leader, this crisis plays to his strengths. Stock markets are plunging and banks are toppling, but he is in his comfort zone. He operates confidently in this arena, not least because he has developed relationships with all the key players around the globe. In quick succession on Friday afternoon, he held conversations with Angela Merkel of Germany, Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, as part of the effort to cajole other governments to take co-ordinated global action before the Western world's financial system implodes. Those talks were conducted on a mobile phone while he was on a train to Swindon. Such are the surrealities of being Prime Minister at this time. One moment, he is trying to persuade the President of France to copy his bank rescue; the next, he is attempting to explain the plan to a pensioners' group in a marginal seat. </p> <p>His evident hope is that this crisis will win him a second chance with all those voters who had lost respect for him as a leader. This is his opportunity to reverse Vince Cable's deadly crack, to transform himself from Mr Bean back into the Iron Leader again. In early September, I had a conversation with one of Mr Brown's closest allies in the cabinet. This minister did not argue with me when I put it to him that the voters were so settled in their animosity towards Gordon Brown that they 'hit the mute button' whenever he tried to speak to them. 'The crisis is a chance to be heard. People are now willing to listen to him again,' says one of the Prime Minister's senior aides.</p> <p>That does not mean they will be willing to vote for him in 20 months' time. There is a huge dislocation between how things are viewed by those inside the political beltway and how they look to the public. Politicians, commentators and economic sages may be impressed by the intelligence and boldness with which Mr Brown has moved to try to save the stricken banks. Voters are furious that so much taxpayers' money is being committed to rescue financiers from their own folly and they are delivering that message to Labour MPs This is why Mr Brown is cranking up the rhetoric by saying reckless bankers will be 'punished' in ways as yet unspecified. To try to assuage the voters over the coming days, you will hear him and his ministers arguing that they are not committing these vast sums because they love bankers, but because the alternative is the ruination of the whole economy.</p> <p>The Prime Minister is nervous of voter rage and he is right to be so. The public are entitled to be incandescent with the discredited titans of finance, not one of whom has yet offered a single word of public remorse or apology for what they have done.</p> <p>That public mood is likely to get much blacker as the economy turns down. The plunge in global stock markets over the past few days has been caused by panicked investors pricing stocks for a very nasty recession. Even on the more optimistic forecasts, a lot of voters are going t o be nursing losses - of their jobs, of their homes, of their pensions. At the same time, ballooning government debt points to a severe squeeze on services. Whitehall is already anticipating the bloodiest spending negotiations for a generation. Mr Brown has guaranteed spending only on health and education, which implies serious pain everywhere else.</p> <p>Politically difficult in any circumstances, the boggling billions directed to the banks makes this even harder to sell to the voters. Every time a cut falls, the cry will go up: you could find \u00a3500bn for the banks, but you can't find \u00a310m for my cherished public service. </p> <p>Even if voters do credit him with firefighting the financial inferno, they may also regard Gordon Brown as one of the people responsible for lighting the blaze. There's an interesting debate to be had about when the Age of Irresponsibility began. Was it in 1997 (the Tory version) when Gordon Brown moved into the Treasury and redesigned the regulatory structure? Was it in 1986 (the left's version) when Cecil Parkinson's bonfire of controls unleashed the 'Big Bang'? Does culpability lie with both? Voters are likely to leave that argument to academics and blame the man who has been running the economy for more than a decade. </p> <p>That reckoning lies in the future. For now, Gordon Brown has won more time, recovered some respect and invested his premiership with a greater sense of purpose. I can say what his aides dare not. He is enjoying this crisis. In fact, he has probably never felt more alive as Prime Minister. That is quite a transformation for a man who, just a few weeks ago, was being taken for dead.</p>",
  "<p>In the week of the crash in 1929, Wall Street fell by 23 per cent. Last week, it fell by 18 per cent, London and Frankfurt by 21 per cent and Japan's Nikkei by 24 per cent. Every major financial centre's interbank market is frozen. Trust and confidence have collapsed; the global system is paralysed on a scale that now surpasses 1929. There is a combination of a worldwide bank run, seizure of credit markets and collapse of asset values that could plunge the globe into a depression. This is history's joke: the crisis of capitalism long predicted by communists and socialists who are no longer able to take advantage of it.</p> <p>The scale of what is happening is scarcely credible. On Wednesday morning, the UK government committed itself to an unparalleled \u00a3500bn of extra support for Britain's paralysed financial system - up to \u00a350bn of capital, guarantees for \u00a3250bn of lending between banks and additional injections of cash. This is the biggest, most comprehensive and best-thought-through operation of its kind mounted by any Western government since 1945. It was rewarded for its pains by a further 10 per cent fall in stock market prices, a further freezing of the already crisis-stricken interbank markets and, most ominously of all, the beginnings of a run on sterling.</p> <p>One government can do so much; the British plan was simply swept to one side by what is now a financial pandemic which only a global response can address. G7 finance ministers, at last jointly aware of the gravity of the crisis, attempted to produce such a response in their five-point plan announced at the meeting of the IMF and World Bank in Washington on Friday night. </p> <p>The proposals are distressingly broad brush and hardly add to the markets' knowledge. It is no longer news that governments do not intend to let a major bank fail, nor that they will protect depositors, inject capital from taxpayers, free up liquidity and do whatever is necessary to keep the system going. At best, I fear it will temporarily hold the line; at worst, it will be ignored as platitudinous.</p> <p>The problem is that the markets no longer have any faith that the world financial system they helped create has any future. The model is bust. It is encouraging that both the Americans and Germans are now moving towards what they considered ideologically unthinkable a fortnight ago - they are preparing to follow the British lead, take big public stakes in banks and offer guarantees to the interbank market.</p> <p>But while this is a necessary condition for stabilisation it is not sufficient. What needs to happen on top is an assault on the dark heart of the global financial system - the $55 trillion market in credit derivatives and, in particular, credit default swaps, the mechanisms routinely used to insure banks against losses on risky investments. This is a market more than twice the size of the combined GDP of the US, Japan and the EU. Until it is cleaned up and the toxic threat it poses is removed, the pandemic will continue. Even nationalised banks, and the countries standing behind them, could be overwhelmed by the scale of the losses now emerging.</p> <p>This market in credit derivatives has grown explosively over the last decade largely in response to the $10 trillion market in securitised assets - the packaging up of income from a huge variety of sources (office rents, port charges, mortgage payments, sport stadiums) and its subsequent sale as a 'security' to be traded between banks. </p> <p>Plainly, these securities are risky, so the markets invented a system of insurance. A buyer of a securitised bond can purchase what is in effect an insurance contract that will protect him or her against default - a credit default swap (CDS). But unlike the comprehensive insurance contract on your car which you have with one insurance company, these credit default contracts can be freely bought and sold. Complex mathematical models are continually assessing the risk and comparing it to market prices. If the risk falls, the CDSs are cheap; if the risk rises - because, say, a credit rating agency declares the issuing company is less solid - the price rises. Hedge funds speculate in them wildly.</p> <p>Their purpose was a market solution to make securitisation less risky; in fact, they make it more risky, as we are now witnessing. The collapse of Lehman Brothers - the refusal to bail it out has had cataclysmic consequences - means that it can no longer honour $110bn of bonds, nor $440bn of CDSs it had written. On Friday, the dud contracts were auctioned, with buyers paying a paltry eight cents for every dollar. Put another way, there is now a $414bn hole which somebody holding these contracts has to honour. And if your head is spinning now, add the three bust Icelandic banks. They can no longer honour more than $50bn of bonds, nor a mind-boggling $200bn of CDSs.</p> <p>The implications are global. The UK government might have frozen Icelandic assets in Britain to get some compensation for the losses, but we are only part of the story. Austrian, Danish and Finnish banks all hold near valueless Icelandic bonds on which they will have bought CDSs from heaven knows whom - Deutsche Bank? A two-bit hedge fund in Dubai? Lehman Brother? Kaupthing? Shareholders in Barclays and RBS are rightly concerned; the two banks hold a stunning $2.4 trillion of CDSs each - more than the UK's GDP.</p> <p>We don't know their exposure to Iceland and Lehman Brothers, but with such enormous credit derivative books it would be amazing if there were none. While every bank tries to pass the toxic parcel on to somebody else, the system has to find the money. So will compensation for the near valueless contracts and thus now uninsured debt ultimately be made - and by whom? And because nobody knows - not the regulators, banks or governments - who owns the swaps and whether they are credit-worthy, nobody can answer the question. Maybe holders of insurance policies will get the cash due to them, but will that weaken somebody else? The result - panic.</p> <p>This is the ultra-dangerous downward vortex in which the system is locked. It is why share prices are plummeting. As recession deepens, there will be defaults on securitised bonds and the potential collapse of more banks outside the G7 ring-fence. Nobody knows what proportion of the $55 trillion of credit default contracts that have actually been written will be honoured and who might bear losses running into trillions of dollars. Buying new contracts to insure against default has become prohibitively expensive. Securitisation, and insuring against risk, has effectively ceased. And because the markets don't know where the losses will fall, banks cannot borrow from each other except overnight or from their central bank. Credit flows are at a standstill. Property prices are plummeting. A famous economist, Hyman Minsky, foretold that unregulated finance capitalism inevitably ends in a meltdown and slump. The world is facing a Minsky moment.</p> <p>One element of the necessary response is in the making - giving banks access to unlimited taxpayers' capital, guaranteeing interbank lending and pumping cash into the system. I suspect that only majority government control of the West's major banks will now stabilise matters. But that is not enough. The markets no longer believe in the financial market structures they have invented. As a result, the US Fed, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and Bank of England must become not just lenders, but insurers of last resort, providing the insurance contracts that the markets have stopped. Governments must write CDSs themselves. </p> <p>In future, the global credit derivative markets will need to be organised into regulated, licensed exchanges rather than conducted in a way that made the Wild West look tame. We will need a global authority to supervise the credit derivative markets, write insurance contracts and stand ready to guarantee that contracts are settled. And we will need a global, independent credit rating agency to assess risk objectively. More immediately, there needs to be deep co-ordinated cuts in interest rates; last week's half per cent cut was useful but inadequate.</p> <p>I don't know whether politicians and their advisers can move as quickly as they need in so many areas and collaborate across so many countries to restore stability. Most of those who should be leading the world's recovery are, politically speaking, numbered among the politically walking wounded or dead; either near the end of office like George Bush, in a fractious coalition like Angela Merkel, or leading a dysfunctional party like the weak Taro Aso of Japan. </p> <p>Without collaboration and leadership, we face disaster. On Friday, there were terrifying signs that the contagion was spreading to the foreign exchange markets: for example, the Australian dollar dived 20 per cent against the yen over the week; sterling fell 3 per cent against the dollar. If investors start to think that politicians cannot control the situation and the necessary international action falls short of what is required, then Britain has got neither the GDP nor financial firepower to support the scale of capital flight and financial losses that will hit the City of London. </p> <p>The pound could fall at least the 30 to 40 per cent that currencies fell during the Asian financial crisis. London could become the centre of the rout. If so, it will not just be complete nationalisation of the banks we will be considering but the reimposition of capital and exchange controls.</p> <p>For 30 years, greedy, callow, ignorant financiers, supported by no less callow politicians from all the political parties, have proclaimed the wonders of financial innovation and how proud we all should be of the City of London. The price tag for their behaviour is an economic calamity. We should never have bought such snake oil. The consolation in these dark times is that we never will again.</p>",
  "<p>Newport Gwent Dragons got their Heineken Cup campaign off to a flying start to beat the battling Glasgow Warriors. The boot of home fly-half James Arlidge proved the difference as both teams ran in three tries - the Dragons through a brace from Gareth Wyatt and one from Colin Charvis, while Lome Fa'atau, Max Evans and Alastair Kellock crossed for the visitors.</p> <p>From the start, it looked as if the Scotsmen were in for a tough afternoon as the Welsh region piled on the pressure, full-back Phil Dollman losing the ball as he stretched to touchdown under the posts in the opening three minutes.</p> <p>But, as the Dragons pressed towards the line, Glasgow hit them with a sucker-punch. Arlidge's pass to Australian centre Rory Sidey was intercepted by Warriors' wing Fa'atau for a 95-metre sprint under the posts, making Colin Gregor's conversion simple.</p> <p>That set the scene for a good first-half contest where play went from end to end and both teams survived moments where they could have conceded tries. Fa'atau nearly went over again in the left corner when he was put away just a few metres from the line but he dropped the ball.</p> <p>Gregor, the replacement at stand-off for Parks, kicked Glasgow into a 10-0 lead after 19 minutes, however the visitors soon found themselves living off scraps of possession and defending their territory.</p> <p>A brilliant tackle by Dougie Hall on Dragons prop Adam Black two metres from his line prevented a first home touchdown following a sustained attack involving several forwards. The only points on the board for the home side by the half-hour were two penalties from Arlidge.</p> <p>But when flanker Kelly Brown found himself sent to the sin-bin for an infringement at a ruck, it signalled a turnaround in fortunes for the home side. They attacked again through former Wales captain Charvis, the Dragons flanker, for Arlidge to feed centre Marc Stcherbina and send wing Wyatt over in the corner.</p> <p>Arlidge failed with the conversion, but added a 30-metre drop goal on the stroke of half-time to give his side a 14-10 lead. </p> <p>While Brown was still warming the bench Arlidge further increased the Dragons lead with a penalty in front of the posts early in the second half. </p> <p>Glasgow would not give in, though, and levelled the match when centre Evans went in at the corner and Gregor landed a brilliant long-range conversion.</p> <p>The relief was short-lived. Wyatt squeezed in at the corner for his second try and Charvis gave them a 10-point lead with the Dragons' third. </p> <p>Glasgow continued to fight as captain Kellock drove over from 10 metres to make it 29-22 and, as the changes came off both benches, the Warriors went up a gear. They were frustrated, though, as Arlidge booted a second drop goal to restore the 10-point advantage and handling errors let Glasgow down too many times towards the final whistle.</p> <p>Cardiff Blues romped to a comfortable eight-try victory over Italian champions Calvisano in Pool 6 Ma'ama Molitika, Jason Spice, Tom Shanklin, Ben Blair, Nick Robinson, Leigh Halfpenny and Gareth Thomas all went over, with a penalty try also added to the Blues' tally, to put the Italian side to the sword with ease.</p> <p>Justin Purll scored a try in the first half as the hosts briefly threatened a shock result. But they were little match for the strength and pace of the Welsh region who breezed through with a devastating second-half blitz of tries.</p> <p>Wasps will hope to get their season back on track today when they take on Castres at Adams Park. Danny Cipriani has recovered from his comeback match 10 days ago, not to mention the punch in the face he suffered from team-mate Josh Lewsey during the week, to take his place at fly-half. Lewsey is moved to outside-centre as he tries to find some form as well as a position to settle in. Lachlan Mitchell starts at full-back, having impressed in Wasps' defeat at Gloucester last weekend. </p> <p>Bath, meanwhile, no doubt taking inspiration from Sale's result at Clermont, take on the other finalists in last season's French championship, the champions Toulouse. Butch James is among a number of regulars to return to Bath's side.</p>",
  "<p>Last weekend, a well known London writer was sauntering down the Portobello Road. He had set out early for a Saturday evening meal with friends, but was last to arrive at the restaurant having been 'unavoidably detained' en route by a group of football fans wearing black-and-amber striped shirts.</p> <p>'<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity\">Hull City</a>!' the writer shouted across the road when he saw them walking in the opposite direction. 'Good luck tomorrow, stick it up them again.'</p> <p>'Hey, lad, come and have a pint,' they said, which is why the writer, a keen football fan, was late for his meal. In the nearest pub they relived Hull's amazing win at Arsenal and predicted another one at Tottenham the following day. They got it.</p> <p>There had been similar scenes of mutual celebration after that Arsenal match, arguably the biggest shock result in the history of the Premier League. Strangers were offering Hull fans high-fives on the streets of north London.</p> <p>Only rarely does this happen in football. An underdog team pull off a barely believable win against illustrious rivals, and, for a while, other fans adopt them as their temporary second team. It happened more than 30 years ago when Carlisle led the old First Division for a few games, but, in most cases, it is a cup run that puts the focus on an 'unfashionable' smaller team: Hereford in the 1970s, Grimsby and their inflatable fish in the 1980s, and, for those with a wider interest, Calais in the 1990s, when the non-League team reached the French Cup final.</p> <p>This is much more than a cup run, though. And Hull are not just an underdog team, they are an underdog city, irked by years of negative publicity about being king of the 'crap towns', worst place to live in Britain, cheapest houses, lowest wages, most chip shops and so on.</p> <p>'The team's success is about more than just the club,' says Alex Burgess, a local broadcaster who has followed the Tigers, home and away, for 30 years. 'It's about the city and the way it's perceived.'</p> <p>Robinson Crusoe set sail from Hull in 1651. Even today, people joke that the best thing about going to Hull is leaving again.</p> <p>The city of Kingston upon Hull, to give it its full name, has been tarnished by uncontrollable circumstances throughout its history. Only London was bombed more by the Luftwaffe than Hull during the Second World War. And, in the mid-1970s, the 'Cod War' - a confrontation with Iceland over fishing rights in the North Atlantic - devastated Hull's economy. The city's population of 257,000 is 50,000 fewer than it was in 1939.</p> <p>But there was a positive blip in the 1980s. Part of it was because of sporting achievement, with two teams from the city dominating rugby league. Hull and Hull Kingston Rovers famously faced each other in the 1980 Challenge Cup final at Wembley. Music was at the forefront of the feel-good factor, though, with many Hull-based bands earning acclaim. One of those bands, the Housemartins, titled their first album London 0 Hull 4 because of the 'us and them' situation between Humberside and the capital.</p> <p>The footballers are now doing for the city what the musicians did 20 years ago. And, on Sunday, the Hull City players could make it London 0 Hull 4. If the Tigers defeat West Ham at the KC Stadium, it will be their fourth straight victory against the capital's Premier League clubs.</p> <p>Third-placed Hull toppled Fulham at home on the opening day of the club's first season in English football's top flight. On the past two weekends, they have wowed the nation with those victories at Arsenal and Tottenham.</p> <p>Asked if he ever thought London 0 Hull 4 could be possible in football, the Housemartins' front man, Paul Heaton, says: 'Absolutely not. In the Eighties, it was pure rugby. Football fans were quiet in the pub, while the rugby fans would dance around. They'd say, \"Hull City got a good draw,\" and the response would be, \"Yeah, whatever.\" The football fans were dormant for years.'</p> <p>Heaton lived in Hull, but he is a Sheffield United fan. 'I thought I'd be really jealous, but it's the opposite,' he says. 'It's because of the way they are patronised by people like Mark Lawrenson [on Match of the Day]. He's not looked into the fact that Phil Brown studies teams 10 times more than Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. He's incapable of saying it's genius. They look at it like it's a little boy doing well.'</p> <p>Heaton looks back fondly on the time when the album came out. 'It was more like what you'd get for a local boxer, not a pop star. When I went to my local at Christmas, I got a standing ovation from pensioners.'</p> <p>As someone who follows European football closely, he can see the parallels between Hull and Calais. 'The Hull mentality is a docker's mentality,' he says. 'They're quite hard. Not necessarily violent, but they are tough.'</p> <p>Everything But The Girl were another successful group based in Hull during the 1980s. The band's name came from a slogan used by a shop in Hull that sold furniture. Singer Ben Watt, born in London, studied at Hull University, where he met Tracey Thorn. The two of them formed the band.</p> <p>Hull remains close to Watt's heart, even though he now lives back in the capital. 'It is often mocked and ridiculed for being the dirtiest or the most violent or the ugliest city, but I loved it,' he says. 'It had a rough, faded stylishness about it. For anyone growing up in the era of The Smiths, it had everything.'</p> <p>Watt, who supports his local team Chelsea, is heartened by Hull City's feats. He admits to 'a wry smile' when he found out about the Arsenal and Spurs wins.</p> <p>The 2-1 triumph at the Emirates Stadium, where Arsenal had lost only once in 59 games, was the most stunning in Hull's 104-year history. Over the summer some bookmakers offered odds of 8-1 that Hull would fail to win a game all season.</p> <p>Burgess, a former BBC Radio Humberside commentator who works for KCFM, says: 'I've seen us lose at places like Bury, a dump of a ground, and Belle Vue in Doncaster, where there was a bank of grass as the away end. When we scored at Arsenal we were jumping around, punching our fists in the air and the stewards looked angry. I had a feeling of genuine disbelief.'</p> <p>It was no surprise that Burgess was ecstatic. Those goals eclipsed some poignant childhood memories. 'I came home from school for dinner and we had gone into administration for the first time. On the telly, they were saying we were going bust.'</p> <p>Rick Skelton, of Hullcityonline.com (and who contributes to Observer Sport's Fans' Verdict), says: 'The highlight so far was Geovanni's goal at Arsenal. That's the best goal I've ever seen live. We got back too late to celebrate, but I've heard that the pubs have been packed back in Hull. People were locked out of the pubs for the Arsenal game.'</p> <p>Burgess did not have that problem. 'On the way back from the game on that Saturday night, I was getting calls from my mates at the bar,' he says. 'They were saying that, however late we got back, they'd keep the bar open so we could celebrate. And we did. We came back that night, but lots of fans stay for a weekend.'</p> <p>Burgess hopes the Emirates triumph will help to alter Hull's image. 'The league tables regarding the city don't lie. But what I dislike is opinions based on spurious facts - things such as the Location, Location, Location programme [which made fun of Hull and said it was a dump]. I don't like anybody coming to the city so they can go away and say it's the worst place to live in the country.'</p> <p>Hull City midfielder Nick Barmby, born and bred in the city, agrees. 'Hull always used to get a bad rap,' he says. 'And it did drive you mad. I wouldn't have come back here and brought my kids up in this environment if it was bad.'</p> <p>Barmby, who had played for Spurs, Middlesbrough and Everton, and won cups at Liverpool, fulfilled a boyhood dream when he joined Hull in the summer of 2004. The aim was to help take Hull, who had just been promoted from League Two, into the Premier League.</p> <p>But critics castigated him. They considered it a ridiculous move for a talented 30-year-old. After all, Barmby had been a Premier League player for 12 successive seasons, scored the opening goals in the England reigns of Glenn Hoddle and Sven-Goran Eriksson, played in England's 5-1 win over Germany in Munich and was once described by Pel\u00e9 as England's most gifted footballer.</p> <p>'At the time, I got slaughtered for moving down the divisions,' Barmby says. 'People were saying that I'd lost my bottle and I wanted to be in my comfort zone, and that I didn't really want to play at the top level any more. That couldn't have been further from the truth. We had a dream. Hull is truly on the map now.'</p> <p>And they could be on the map even more prominently in 2018, when England hopes to host the World Cup. The FA are encouraging a geographical spread of venues and seeking bids from cities not normally considered for internationals. At the past three World Cups there have been examples of locations being selected unexpectedly - Montpellier, Seogwipo and Leipzig. Hull wants to be among them in 2018.</p> <p>'We have held England under-21 internationals in Hull,' council leader Carl Minns says. 'The stadium is easily extendable. It's designed for a quick turnaround.'</p> <p>A World Cup venue? Then even Robinson Crusoe wouldn't want to leave.</p>",
  "<p>The US president, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgebush\">George Bush</a>, today expressed confidence that the world's major economies could overcome the financial crisis after ministers and central bank governors from seven leading nations agreed a five-point plan to avert the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">global turmoil</a>.</p> <p>The G7 group agreed to take \"urgent and exceptional action\" to bail out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">banks</a>, amid fears that a fresh wave of panic had pushed worldwide financial systems to the brink of collapse.</p> <p>They agreed to take \"all necessary steps\", including adopting Britain's plans to part-nationalise banks, in order to kick-start lending in frozen credit markets after Wall Street suffered the worst week in its history.</p> <p>The financial turmoil is a \"serious global crisis that requires a serious global response\", Bush said after a meeting at the White House with international finance ministers including the chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a>.</p> <p>The head of the IMF, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, also speaking in Washington, expressed concern that rich nations had failed to restore confidence in markets. \"Intensifying solvency concerns about a number of the largest US-based and European financial institutions have pushed the global financial system to the brink of systemic meltdown,\" he said.<br> The crisis talks came after the US government announced it would buy stock in troubled financial institutions in a bid to stabilise the global markets.</p> <p>\"As our nations carry out this plan we must ensure the actions of one country do not contradict or undermine the actions of another,\" Bush said. \"In our interconnected world no nation will gain by driving down the fortunes of another. We're in this together, we will come through it together.\" </p> <p>The president said that while nations had to confront the challenges unique to their individual financial systems, they also had to ensure their actions were coordinated. </p> <p>\"I'm confident that the world's major economies can overcome the challenges we face,\" he said. \"There have been moments of crisis in the past when powerful nations turned themselves against each other, started to wall themselves off from the world. This time is different.\" </p> <p>The G7 issued its five-point plan in a short communique after meeting in Washington yesterday. It pledged to \"ensure that our banks and other financial intermediaries, as needed, can raise capital from public as well as private sources in sufficient amounts to re-establish confidence and permit them to continue lending to households and businesses\".</p> <p>Facing the most severe stockmarket crash since 1929, Henry Paulson, the US treasury secretary, said the US would use some of the $700bn, earmarked by Congress to buy up Wall Street's \"toxic waste\", to buy stakes in US banks.</p> <p>He said the government programme to purchase stock in private US financial firms will be open to a broad array of institutions, including banks, in an effort to help them raise money.</p> <p>Paulson said the G7 finance ministers \"finalised an aggressive action plan to address the turmoil in the global financial markets\", and that they were focused on the need to stabilise the financial markets. He said it had never been more important to find \"collective solutions\".</p> <p>The G7 was galvanised into action yesterday by a nerve-shredding month on the financial markets. Yesterday alone, the FTSE closed down 8.9%, slipping below the 4,000 mark for the first time in five years. It fell 381.74 points, to 3,932.06, a 21% fall over the week, wiping \u00a3250bn off the value of Britain's companies in the City's worst week since the crash of 1987.</p> <p>Across Europe, every major market saw at least a fifth wiped off its value during the week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 700 points at the opening bell, but later rallied to finish 128 points down on 8,451. The Dow has fallen by 18.1% this week.</p> <p>Shares in UK banks RBS and HBOS were among the worst hit, with RBS falling 25% and HBOS 19%. The government may be forced to take a stake of up to 50% in RBS after its market capitalisation was reduced to \u00a312bn last night.</p> <p>With little sign that country-by-country plans have helped to kick-start lending, the G7 believes immediate action is vital to avoid a major slump. The past four weeks have seen the biggest cut in growth forecasts in living memory, and the IMF has warned that the world economy is \"on the cusp\" of recession.</p> <p>Darling said yesterday: \"If international cooperation is to mean anything, it means governments have to move on from simply agreeing a general approach, and doing something to resolve the problems we are facing today.\"</p> <p>The chancellor hinted that the government would exact a price from UK bank chiefs deemed at fault for creating the crisis. He said taxpayers \"won't accept people taking large risks that have had hugely damaging effects, not just on individual institutions, but on the wider economic system. Agreements will be negotiated.\"</p> <p>Foreign exchange markets were also hit by panic. Sterling at one point slumped to $1.68, a five-year low against the dollar. Meanwhile, Gordon Brown dispatched a Treasury officials and lawyers to Reykjavik in an effort to reclaim some of the \u00a31bn from British savers under threat from the collapse of Icelandic banks.</p> <p>More details of the Treasury's rescue plan were revealed yesterday, with the recognition that if it fails, wholesale nationalisation of Britain's banking system is the only alternative. The government will buy shares in banks at market prices, and place them in an arms-length fund.

In a desperate attempt to deflect attention from an economic crisis and a faltering campaign, John McCain and Sarah Palin have begun shamelessly using Obama's \"blackness\" and alleged \"Muslimy-ness\" to suggest the biracial senator from Illinois is an extremist terrorist.</p> <p>During the second, monumentally flaccid <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-debate8-2008oct08,0,3276964.story\">presidential debate</a>, a condescending and smarmy McCain pointed to Obama and referred to him as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nimMa7WqMx0\">\"that one\"</a>.</p> <p>It would have been truly maverick had McCain simply dropped the ambiguous rhetoric, boarded his professed straight talk express and instead called him out as \"that quasi Muslim,\" \"that Hussein\" or \"that guy whose name rhymes with Osama\".</p> <p>Not to be out-mavericked, hockey mom and moose hunting vice-presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, recently stated that Obama might <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/04/AR2008100401212.html\">\"pal around with terrorists\"</a> due to his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/us/politics/04ayers.html\">tangential connection</a> to William Ayers, founder of the 1960s radical group the Weather Underground.</p> <p>Furthermore, Palin took the racial cue from Senator Clinton and dusted off last spring's Reverend Wright card to imply Obama's anti-whiteness and racial radicalism. When William Kristol <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/06/opinion/06kristol.html\">asked Palin about Wright</a>, she replied: \"I don't know why that association isn't discussed more, because those were appalling things that that pastor had said about our great country. [Obama's former pastor said \"God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human.\"] Palin continued: \"To me, that does say something about character. But, you know, I guess that would be a John McCain call on whether he wants to bring that up\".</p> <p>Undoubtedly, since both mavericks have now brought that up, one naturally assumes they adhere to the principle that a candidate's \"association\" should presumptively reflect his character. Employing their own standard, let's investigate Governor Palin's and Senator McCain's character based purely on their friends and associations. </p> <p>Regarding extremist religious mentors, Sarah Palin's pastor, Larry Kroon of Wasilla Bible Church in Alaska, beat Obama's pastor in a \"God damn-off\" by suggesting the sinful conduct of Americans would <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blogs/campaignmatters/355545\">invite God's wrath</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>Listen, [God] is gonna' deal with all the inhabitants of the earth. He is gonna' strike out His hand against, yes, Wasilla; and Alaska; and the United States of America. There's no exceptions here -- there's none. It's all.</p> </blockquote> <p>Not to be outdone in associating with angry, reactionary religious leaders, Senator McCain originally courted influential pastor John Hagee's support for his candidacy. The same pastor - known for his anti-Catholic, homophobic and anti-Semitic remarks - bellowed these tolerant and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/max-blumenthal/aipac-cheers-an-antisemi_b_43377.html\">benevolent words of wisdom</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>It was the disobedience and rebellion of the Jews, God's chosen people, to their covenantal responsibility to serve only the one true God, Jehovah, that gave rise to the opposition and persecution that they experienced beginning in Canaan and continuing to this very day \u2026</p> </blockquote> <p>Although McCain conveniently renounced this endorsement after a media firestorm, he originally <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200802290012\">said</a>: \"All I can tell you is that I am very proud to have Pastor John Hagee's support\". One wonders what the crucial, yet undecided, Jewish voters in Florida think about such an association. </p> <p>Sarah Palin, a political neophyte who made her national introduction only a month ago, recently stated that \"it's really important for Americans to start knowing who the 'real' Barrack Obama is.\" Apparently, two years of strenuous vetting by the media have conclusively shown Obama has never been a card carrying, registered member of the Islamic faith. Furthermore, he attended an Indonesian elementary school, or madrassa, during his youth, which was conclusively proven not to be a jihadi, Islamist terrorist training camp.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Governor Palin, already embroiled in the unresolved <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Public_Safety_Commissioner_dismissal\">Troopergate</a> and <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/whats_the_full_story_on_the_bridge.html\">Bridge to Nowhere</a> controversies, has aggressively avoided impromptu press questions, instead opting to sit for only two thoroughly embarrassing one-on-one interviews. However, we do know that Sarah Palin's husband, Todd, <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20081010.CAMPAIGNPALIN10/TPStory/International\">twice registered</a> as a member of the <a href=\"http://www.akip.org/\">Alaska Independence party</a>, a fierce states' rights group that favors Alaska's secession from the US, which is a treasonous and criminal act showing disloyalty to one's nation.</p> <p>Yet, true character has been exclusively reserved for John McCain, a man who takes immense pride in his sage wisdom borne from years of experience as a war veteran and US senator. He assures us his clarion judgment will help steer America from the brink of economic disaster towards a new destination of financial prosperity.</p> <p>However, he conveniently fails to mention his association with Charles Keating, he of the infamous <a href=\"http://keatingeconomics.com/\">Keating Five</a> savings and loan scandal that cost the federal government nearly $2bn and defrauded nearly 23,000 bond-holders, including senior citizens who lost their life savings. Although Senator McCain was cleared for his involvement in the scandal, the Senate Ethics Committee specifically criticised his \"poor judgment\".</p> <p>Perhaps that poor judgment reflects his choice of advisors, such as campaign manager Rick Davis, co-founder of a lobbying firm, Davis Manafort, that was paid $15,000 a month by Freddie Mac for consulting. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/us/politics/24davis.html\">According to the New York Times</a>, \"Davis took a leave from Davis Manafort for the presidential campaign, but as an equity holder continues to benefit from its income\". </p> <p>Furthermore, two of McCain's top advisers were recently lobbyists for Ameriquest Mortgage, a lender involved in the recent mortgage meltdown. In March, the Daily News reviewed disclosure forms and <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/03/31/2008-03-31_key_mccain_advisors_were_lobbyists_for_s.html\">reported</a>: \"John Green, [Senator McCain's] chief liaison to Congress, and Wayne Berman, his national finance co-chairman, billed more than $720,000 in lobbying fees from 2005 through last year to Ameriquest Mortgage through their lobbying firm\".</p> <p>One wonders how McCain can reform the economy when his closest associates consulted for some of the players deeply involved in the current crisis.</p> <p>These questions warrant intelligent inquiry, honest disclosure and thorough analysis. Who has time for such elitist endeavours when fanning the flames of fear-mongering, racial hysteria and smear politics is so much more effective?</p> <p>If indeed Senator McCain and Governor Palin believe one should be assumed guilty merely by one's associations, perhaps they are no better than \"that one\".</p>",
  "<p>The political novel is alive and well. Veteran historian and biographer John Stewart has followed up his entertaining blend of sci-fi and political economy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/19/alienjustice\">Visitors</a>, with an insightful political thriller, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/President-Political-Novel-John-Stewart/dp/0856832618\">The President</a>.</p> <p>Imagine <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing_(TV_series)\">The West Wing</a> penned by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Greene\">Graham Greene</a> and you'd be pretty close. In literary terms it's a little conventional to come under the Booker radar, but were it to find a sufficiently wide audience, it could have a profound impact on our moribund politics. </p> <p>The novel's principal message is that if politicians want to engage with and inspire electorates, they need to look afresh at the relationship between politics and economics, and persuade voters that they can exercise effective direction over the economy and so protect the interests of all citizens, not just the wealthy. This, after all, is what democracy is supposed to be about.</p> <p>Stewart's President Duncan is a widower and a reflective man, not afraid to allow the spiritual side of life to guide his political thought. So when one day he wakes up with a feeling that despite occupying the most powerful office on the planet he is unable to do anything of real value, he throws caution to the wind and decides to take on vested interests regardless of the consequences for his re-election later that year.</p> <p>He starts by taking every opportunity to talk up the possibility of a more inclusive and just society. While avoiding specifics, he makes a strong argument that continued widespread poverty in the richest nation in history is a moral issue, and challenges his audiences to think in more ambitious terms about creating a fairer society.</p> <p>\"If human beings show no sign of moral sensitivity, are they human? Is morality an in-built requirement of humanity, and if it's absent will society suffer and eventually collapse?\" he asks. \"We have civil justice, now it's time to turn our minds to economic justice.\"</p> <p>Finally, having secured the nation's attention, he poses three questions: what is location value? Who created it? And to whom does it belong? In so doing he sparks a fundamental debate about one of the cornerstones of conventional, neoclassical economic thinking: that the right to land ownership also confers on landowners the right to keep the rent that accrues in land values, wealth that is a consequence not of the labour effort of the landowner, nor of any capital applied to their land, nor even, exclusively, of any labour employed on it. </p> <p>Land rent is a consequence of the natural workings of the economy over time, and as such is created by the whole community. Why then should landowners, who comprise a tiny proportion of the population, and include most of the richest corporations in the world, be entitled to keep it as if they were responsible for its creation?</p> <p>By letting the questions hang, this canny president ensures the debate goes beyond the normal reactions to suggestions that location values be collected as a source of public revenue. People gradually come to see that it's not just another tax, nor is it an attempt to penalise landowners and entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Quite the opposite in fact: in the long term, collecting rent would effect a much wider distribution of land and economic opportunities among the population. The creative and entrepreneurial potential of thousands \u2013 even millions \u2013 of citizens would be provided with a more conducive economic environment in which to flourish.</p> <p>The president's cause is aided when a disillusioned corporate magnate and an influential media mogul come on side. But still the electorate must decide. It comes down to the wire, with California delivering the president four more years. In a further echo of The West Wing, Duncan's first act after his re-election is to persuade his defeated Republican rival to make his plan to reconstruct the economy a bipartisan affair.</p> <p>At his inauguration, the president cites Kennedy's rallying cry, but concludes with a quote from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Standing-Justice-Biography-Andrew-MacLaren/dp/0856831948/\">Andrew MacLaren</a>, a Labour MP between the wars: \"Institutional charity and political expedients are no substitute for justice.\" Justice, when talking of people's ability to make something of their lives, is not served by welfare payments and the other devices of redistribution. It can only be served by creating an economy in which all have an equal chance to make the most of whatever talents and abilities they are born with. Stewart's president knows this. </p> <p>There is no indication that either of the real-life candidates for president has the first clue what justice really means. The winner will first have to deal with the fallout from the financial crisis. While Stewart's book might not help much with that challenge, it gives plenty of pointers as to how such crises might be avoided in future.</p> <p>Whoever wins next month, they will not be remembered as a great president unless they are prepared to tackle the economic root causes of injustice and instability. John Stewart's book provides the ideas, and a viable strategy, should either of them want to leave a genuine progressive legacy.</p>",

Well, there are trends you can extrapolate skywards, and then there are blips.

He had, however, already scored a hat-trick that day; Wolves have lost both subsequent games during his suspension. (Which may be down to a big injury list, but let's ignore that.)</p> <p><strong>Kick off</strong> is at 3pm.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Forget what I said about Chris Iwelumo:</strong> Gordon, Broadfoot, Caldwell, Weir, Naysmith, Brown, Fletcher, Robson, Morrison, Maloney, McFadden.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Sky Sports are getting everyone in the mood for the 2010 World Cup finals with a montage set to Africa by Californian cocaine-munching early-80s AOR combo Toto.

Don't blame me, I didn't ask for this.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Anyway, Norway manager Age Hareide gives a debut to 33-year-old keeper Jon Knudsen, after 24-year-old Rune Jarstein copped most of the flak for last month's 2-2 draw with Iceland in Oslo:</strong> Knudsen, Hoiland, Hangeland, Waehler, Riise, the other Riise who isn't John Arne, Stromsted, Grindheim, <em>[Thumping drum solo]</em> It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you, Winsues, Iversen, There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do, Carew.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Burley's confusion explained!</strong> \"Perhaps the reason George Burley looks so perplexed in your photo is that the man on his right is Terry Butcher, Scotland's assistant manager,\" begins Gary Naylor's fair point well made. \"That this man, whose reputation for tactical acumen seems to be based entirely on a willingness to play in a bloodied shirt, is anywhere near an international set-up would be enough to perplex Einstein.\"</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>George Burley's pre-match interview.</strong> Whoever Sky have entrusted with their microphone asks the Scotland manager if his side need to win every home game in order to qualify for South <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=lPT_3PEjnsE\">Africa</a>. \"Every game is crucial,\" is his straight-batted response. He then goes on to give props to West Brom midfielder James Morrison. \"He's a player who will get on the ball, find some space for himself, and create the Norwegian defence some problems,\" says Burley, before scuttling off to look for his shoes, pension book, and house.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Toto: the backlash.</strong> \"Is that the best musical association Sky could come up with?\" asks Ian Copestake, a man who already knows the answer. \"Has the Serengeti been appropriated by South Africa just to accommodate Sky's global geographic laziness?\" Cut them some slack, Ian. Like all of us, they seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that they've become.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>The national anthems.</strong> The Norwegian one is so nondescript I thought for a while someone was pouring a couple of pints of lukewarm water into my lugs. Then the Hampden crowd is forced to listen to that superannuated Kenny Rogers lookalike from The Corries murdering his own song. At least I think he's singing Flower of Scotland, but you can hardly tell for all the needless \"COOOME OONNNNN\"s he's screaming over the pipers.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>The subs, by the way:</strong> McGregor, Alexander, Iwelumo, Boyd, Hartley, Steven Fletcher, Berra; Jarstein, Pedersen, Haestad, Braaten, Skjonsberg,<br>Elyounossi.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> Scotland enjoy some early territorial advantage, but do bugger all with it. A good run from Naysmith down the left, though. A confident and positive start.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Scotland win an early corner down the left but waste it, the long delivery being eventually shinned out of play by Caldwell. Scotland have come flying out of the blocks, like we always knew they would.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Broadfoot shanks a clearance out of play down the Norwegian left. John Arne Riise takes a long throw into the Scottish area which is dealt with well by Weir. This is a nice open start, both teams pelting forward whenever the chance arises.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Maloney skitters down the left, twists and turns, and is hauled down by Winsnes's waist-high hug. The free kick, sent boxwards, is cleared easily, but Scotland come quickly back at Norway, the move ending with Broadfoot taking a rasping shot at goal from just inside the box; it's easily dealt with by Knudsen. I've just noticed the collars of Scotland's shirts are not in fact collars, but white collar-shaped patches drawn round the shoulders. Why is this? Can they not be trusted to iron them properly?</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> The first scare of the match for Scotland, as Carew bursts clear down the centre and into Gordon's area. The keeper comes out to close down the angle, while Caldwell hustles and harries and eventually gets a toe in to deflect the ball out for a corner. That was a very close shave. John Arne Riise takes the resulting corner, but it's headed clear by Naysmith.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Nice play down the wing from Robson and then Broadfoot bamboozles Iversen and nearly releases Fletcher down the right wing. The ball's cut out but that was nice stuff from the Scots.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> There's a lot of long-ball hoofing going on at the moment. I'll not be reporting that with any enthusiasm.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Carew turns Caldwell and tears off down the left. Just as he looks like going one-on-one with Gordon, Broadfoot does brilliantly to slide in and concede the corner. There's trouble for Scotland from the set piece, Hangeland meeting a far-post ball but heading it wildly wide right from eight yards. Iversen wasn't far off turning the effort in with his head, but the ball was spooning up too high for him. Caldwell was the man Hangeland beat to the corner; he's not had a good 60 seconds or so.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Naysmith swings a cross into the Norway area from the left, but there's nobody in the box and Norway are able to faff around for an age. Scotland's bright start has completely fizzled out. A quiet Hampden is already clearly aware that this match could be going a sour way out.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> This is becoming extremely embarrassing for Caldwell, who stands rooted to the spot as Carew picks the ball up and scoots past him into the area, utterly unchallenged. His shot towards the bottom-right is parried well by Gordon, though only to the feet of Bjorn Helge Riise on the edge of the area. Riise shins his first-time shot wide right, another fine chance spurned by Norway. Before Carew showed Caldwell up, by the way, he had sauntered away from Scotland's other three defenders, none of whom could be bothered to make a challenge.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Morrison nips down the right and into the Norway box. He's clear with McFadden and Maloney waiting in the centre, but his low cross is pulled behind both strikers and the chance is gone.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Broadfoot, who is probably the only Scottish player having a half-decent game at the moment, is trying to make things happen. He powers across the face of the Norwegian area and pings a lovely ball across to Maloney on the left - but as the Celtic man races clear into the area, the flag goes up for offside. That is better from Scotland, who have been second best so far.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> McFadden rips down the left and sends a really inviting cross down the corridor of uncertainty and towards the far post. With Morrison lurking, John Arne Riise takes it down calmly, turns, and hooks clear. Why the hell couldn't he do that in the Champions League semi-final earlier this year? Or do what he did in the Champions League semi-final earlier this year again now?</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Iversen slips a ball forward down the right to Carew, who turns on the edge of the area and immediately whips a shot goalwards. Gordon has it covered easily.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Caldwell slaps Iversen in the face while jumping in mid air. The ref blows up for a free kick, 25 yards out: this is John Arne Riise territory. He doesn't hammer it for once, though, rolling the ball into the box for Stromstad to chase and win a corner. From it, there's a bit of a stramash in the area, a cloud with arms and legs sticking out of it, but Weir eventually slices it clear.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Scotland can't keep the ball for much longer than ten seconds a time. This is very poor. Meanwhile Iain Pearson is not prepared to cut Sky any slack whatsoever re Toto: \"South Africa has a hugely impressive musical history: Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masakela, Johnny Clegg, Abdullah Ibrahim, James Phillips, Vusi Mahlasela. They could even try som VokOfPolisieKar (Yes, your translation is probably good). Instead we get some Californian drivel about an East African area thousands of kilometers away. Just imagine if South Africa themed their London Olympics coverage with some Kraftwerk on the grounds it was from the same continent, which is close enough. Or some Bruce Springsteen, since all English speakers look the same anyway.\" Well, you've got that straight, though I don't hold out much hope of television producers changing their tack any time soon.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> There's some head tennis in the Scottish box. Broadfoot bustles the ball away. Riise throws it back into the mix. It's hacked clear again. Riise crosses it back in. It's sliced clear. Stromstad heads across from the left to Carew in the centre; the big striker would have swept home from six yards were it not for a late lunge at the ball from Weir. This is all Norway, and very worrying for Scotland indeed.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Scotland have resorted to pumping long ball after long ball into the Norwegian half. This is awful. \"Have you noticed how flesh-coloured Gordon's kit is?\" asks Steve Cook. \"For a moment I thought that a streaker had run onto the pitch.\" Now you come to mention it, Gordon's get-up is vaguely disconcerting. For those of you who can't see the match, it's vaguely reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYE0LOhkHh0\">Bob Mortimer as Noel Edmonds</a>.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> John Arne Riise cuts inside from the left, drops a shoulder to confuse Broadfoot, and unleashes a screamer from a tight angle which Gordon had covered and is a wee bit too high. Decent play, though.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>45 min: SCOTLAND FINALLY DO SOMETHING!</strong> McFadden diddles around down the left, gets to the byline, and stands up a cross to the far post which Morrison can only head over from four yards. It's not as bad a miss as it sounds, the cross being slightly high and the West Brom midfielder being slightly on the back foot, but that was much better.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Scotland 0-0 Norway.</strong> Seconds later, the ref blows for the interval. Scotland go off to what sounded like a few boos to me. Maybe I misheard. If they did, it wasn't particularly loud and from a minority, but still.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Come back Toto, all is forgiven.</strong> \"If the sound of Runrig at half-time doesn't terrify these Norwegians,\" writes Colin Smith, \"nothing will.\" It's probably not going to make the Scottish feel too good about themselves either, though, is it?</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>And we're off again, with no changes.</strong> Scotland get the ball rolling and hoof it long. It doesn't take long before possession is lost.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> A long ball from Norway this time, and it nearly pays dividends, Carew sending Weir spinning like a teenager full of Special Brew and getting a shot in on goal from five or six yards. Gordon's positioning is excellent, the ball going straight down his throat. Yet again, a great concern for the Scots.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Waehler rakes his studs down the back of McFadden's legs 35 yards out on the left. The referee plays advantage where there was none; eventually Broadfoot passes the ball out of play when standing less than a couple of yards from Brown.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Some hapless defending from Scotland, who have comfortable possession near the centre circle but somehow allow Carew to tear clear down the right, Caldwell's hopeless positioning playing him onside. Carew hares into the box and powers in a shot towards the bottom-right corner; Gordon parries round the post excellently. The corner is easily dealt with, but this is beginning to look very ominous for Scotland. Norway are growing in confidence.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Hoiland picks up the first yellow card of the match for a cynical lunge on Robson as the Celtic midfielder chases a long ball down the centre. There was Norwegian cover, but that was very cynical indeed.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> This is only a matter of time. From a deep corner from the right, Waehler rises by the left-hand post to crash a header into the side netting. Fletcher, standing around lazily, may as well have carried him into the area on a sedan chair, before setting up a step ladder for him to climb. Scotland are shambolic.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Changes are afoot. Braaten replaces Bjorn Helge Riise for Norway. Meanwhile Burley makes two throws of the dice: he replaces Morrison with Steven Fletcher, and takes off McFadden (the decision met with boos) in order to send on debutant Chris Iwelumo (who is received with wild cheers).</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Robson has a slash at goal which is easily gathered by Knudsen.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Now Robson bustles well down the right to win a corner. The set piece is poor, but the substitutions seem to have given the Scots some immediate fire in their bellies.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> This is much, much better already from Scotland. Nothing in particular is happening for them, but they've started to press Norway back all over the pitch with a new high-energy approach. It's almost as if they've suddenly realised that, if they fail to score, there are 28 minutes left of their World Cup campaign.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>64 min: THE WORST MISS IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF ALL FOOTBALL.</strong> Oh dear. This must also go down as the worst debut in the history of international, and indeed possibly all, football. Naysmith cuts inside from the left and scoots clear into the Norway box. He's got Iwelumo in the centre, three yards out. Naysmith's cross along the floor is perfect, cutting the ball past Knudsen and finding the Wolves man in the centre. Iwelumo must roll the ball into an empty net... but somehow he screws the ball wide left of goal. You really have to see this, it was almost impossible to get wrong. Eight minutes, he's been on. Yes, that is the worst miss in the history of all football.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> I still can't believe that. The linesman was actually running back up to the centre circle to signal a goal, so nailed on was the chance. Hampden is stunned into silence. Now I come to think about it, that was Iwelumo's first touch of the ball as an international footballer.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Scotland are pressing and probing around the Norway area, Naysmith and Maloney in particular putting in the legwork, but to be honest the entire team look stunned. Iwelumo is wandering around like he's just been hit in the face by a large cartoon frying pan. \"My friend and I were wondering if Chris Iwelumo was born in Scotland, or if he's just a ringer,\" writes Jon Cummins. \"After that miss, I have no doubt he was born in Scotland.\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Maloney has a dig from just outside the area on the left. It swerves dangerously in the air, and nearly creeps into the bottom-right corner... but doesn't. A good attempt though.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Iwelumo heads a right-wing cross down into the path of Maloney, who is Scotland's most dangerous attacker, which admittedly doesn't say much, or indeed since 64 minutes, anything. Maloney's shot from around the penalty spot is deflected wide right by Riise. The corner is a waste of time.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Stromstad is replaced by Morten Gamst Pedersen.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Scotland are enjoying a lot of the ball in Norway's half, but whenever they get near the area, always elect to drag hopelessly weak shots wide right of goal. First Maloney does it, then Naysmith, then Steven Fletcher.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> I still can't believe that Iwelumo miss.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> What a save from Craig Gordon. Pedersen nutmegs Brown down the right to give himself acres of space. He dinks a cross towards Iversen, free in the centre. Iversen's shot is low and hard, but Gordon comes off his line to smother wonderfully. The ball ends up at the feet of Grindheim, but his attempt to hammer home is blocked by Brown. Norway came so close to hammering the final nail in Scotland's World Cup coffin there.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> This game is over. Everyone can sense it. George Burley is on the touchline clapping his hands together furiously and urging his men on, but he knows, you can see in his eyes he knows.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Carew chases after a long ball. It spins back off the turf and takes Weir out of play, sending the big striker free. He should score, but somehow spoons his effort over the bar. Actually, there could have been a slight touch from Caldwell.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Maloney has a half-chance from the edge of the Norway area but curls his attempt to find the top-right corner just wide.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90 min +1:</strong> There will be two added minutes. In the first, Broadfoot is sent clear down the right. He sends in a delicious ball right along the edge of the six-yard box. Knudsen beaten, a Scotland striker lunges to poke it home. He misses it completely. You don't need me to tell you who it was, either, do you.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Scotland 1-0 Norway, is what it should be, but it isn't. Scotland 0-0 Norway.</strong> Iversen is booked for a late lunge at Maloney in the centre circle. The free kick, lifted long into the Norway area, is useless. The referee blows his whistle, and that is that. Both in terms of this match and, I would suggest, their chances of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>Meanwhile Chris Iwelumo walks off the pitch hanging his head in shame.</strong> Oh dear. The worst debut ever, the worst miss of all time. That's quite a double whammy. Oh dear. Oh Chris! How could you!</p>",
  "<p>No wonder the City and the banking fraternity are purring over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">Darling financial package</a>. It must be the biggest bail-out without strings in modern history. But it is going to skin the taxpayer for a decade or more and stymie expenditure to counter the recession on anything like the scale required.</p> <p>Where else would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking1\">\u00a3400-500bn</a> of public money be ploughed in to unfreeze a set of paralysed institutions without the government taking any controlling interest? Even the \u00a350bn recapitalisation is in the form of preference shares which involve no voting rights. A sum equal to about a third of Britain's entire GDP has been poured into the banking sector unconditionally. Incentives have been given to the banks to participate, but with no enforceability to secure needed outcomes. It shows the government is still far too much in hock to the financial sector, even though they are the miscreants who have brought the country to this impasse.</p> <p>Again, in any other area of public life would vast sums of public assistance be shelled out to salvage failing organisations while retaining the bosses who brought about the catastrophe in the first place? Even private US banks booted out their chief executives when their share prices nosedived as a result of gross mismanagement, notably packing their asset base with toxic derivatives. </p> <p>Here, however, the perpetrators like the RBS boss, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2008/oct/08/royalbankofscotlandgroup.banking\">Fred Goodwin</a>, sail on with impunity, seemingly accountable to no one and now \u2013 adding insult to injury \u2013 eligible for huge dollops of public largesse while retaining their position. The great weakness of the Brown-Darling package is that the sinners go unpunished while the toxic loans they engineered are written off by taxpayers' money.</p> <p>But the really big concern about the Darling plan is that servicing and paying off \u00a3500bn borrowings will pre-empt the public accounts for years if not decades to come and will massively inhibit the handling of the real threat that faces us \u2013 a global depression. That can only be countered by much deeper cuts in interest rates than the 0.5% so <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/interestrates.interestrates\">exaggeratedly welcomed</a> earlier this week, plus a massive public works programme (notably 100,000 social houses built per year, not the 2,500 the government has in mind) and big tax cuts for average and low-paid families. What we absolutely should not get, but probably will, is the opposite \u2013 painful public expenditure cuts made inevitable, we shall be told, by the \u00a3500bn overhang.</p> <p>So how should such a real economy stabilisation package be funded? As Gordon Brown has rightly said, exceptional times call for exceptional measures. The scale of tax evasion by the big corporations and the super-rich, now reliably estimated to rob the Treasury of \u00a375-150bn a year, should be tackled with wartime rigour.</p> <p>The tax havens hiding billions offshore should be opened up by law and the vast wealth illegally accumulated there over decades should be repatriated to replenish Treasury coffers. And in an unprecedented crisis like this, a significant tax surcharge needs to be levied on the broadest shoulders \u2013 the hedge funds and private equity operators, the higher rate taxpayers (particularly the 1% richest) and the biggest businesses. It will hurt, but not doing so will hurt much more.</p>",
  "<p>Strange times bring strange bedfellows. On the same day that Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling were putting the finishing touches to their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">plan</a> to bail out the banks with up to \u00a3500bn of public money, the international labour movement marked the first ever <a href=\"http://www.wddw.org/-English-\">world day for decent work</a>.</p> <p>Events in more than 100 countries across five continents made it a genuinely global occasion, yet fears of imminent recession and accompanying job losses put any celebrations on ice. Instead the day was spent in sober reflection on the role decent work has to play in rebalancing the global economy and addressing the root causes of the crisis now threatening to spread across the world.</p> <p>For with the ink barely dry on the government's immediate rescue plans, attention is already turning to the <a href=\"http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/news/viewArticle.htm?articleId=1218105165015&amp;src=rss\">underlying economic problems</a> that have allowed the current financial crisis to develop. Even now, the recognition is growing that fundamental changes are needed to the global economic system far beyond the reach of recapitalisation packages or injections of liquidity, however large.</p> <p>Increasingly, too, there is an understanding that rebalancing the relationship between capital and labour will be a central element in any long-term solution. Put simply, decent work forms an essential part of the macroeconomic restructuring needed to address the roots of the current malaise.</p> <p>The basic <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/About_the_ILO/Mainpillars/WhatisDecentWork/index.htm\">definition</a> of decent work is productive employment for women and men in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. The moral case for such rights has been clear ever since Engels wrote his classic <a href=\"http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/\">account</a> of the working class in England in 1844, and there is still much to do today to ensure that all workers in Britain enjoy decent pay and working conditions. While the minimum wage <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/05/houseofcommons.economy\">posted</a> its latest rise this month, to \u00a35.73 an hour, many employers still break the law by not paying it. Women migrant workers are those most at <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/newsroom/tuc-15182-f0.cfm\">risk</a>.</p> <p>Yet many of the worst sweatshops relocated long ago to the low-cost labour markets of the developing world. The media has been filled with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/16/supermarkets.retail2\">stories</a> of workers producing goods for the British high street in abominable conditions in countries such as Bangladesh, China and India.</p> <p>Consumers have expressed outrage at news of women being forced to work around the clock for a few pence an hour under the threat of constant abuse and humiliation. As long as there are no legal requirements that companies must guarantee all workers decent conditions and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/12/highstreetretailers.retail\">living wage</a>, such scandals will continue.</p> <p>The UN has also stressed the importance of decent work for poverty reduction. Achieving full employment and decent work for all has been <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/poverty.shtml\">enshrined</a> in the millennium development goals adopted by world leaders at the start of the century.</p> <p>UN agencies <a href=\"http://www.oit.org/public/english/region/asro/bangkok/public/releases/yr2007/pr07_04.htm\">confirm</a> that productive employment is the link that can translate economic growth into long-term development, enabling people to work their way out of poverty rather than just deeper into debt. Without decent work opportunities for the many, growth simply concentrates the benefits of economic development in the hands of an elite few.</p> <p>Yet decent work is no longer just a moral imperative. The financial crisis has underlined the systemic dangers to the wider economy of ignoring workers' rights. For while the crisis may have manifested itself in the <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/investing-and-markets/article.html?in_article_id=452145&amp;in_page_id=3\">convulsions</a> of the financial markets, its roots are to be found in the imbalance which has been allowed to grow between corporate power on the one hand and a disempowered labour movement on the other. \"Light touch\" globalisation has brought multinational corporations vast new freedoms as the regulations governing their operations are dismantled in country after country. By contrast, workers have found their rights, wages and working conditions increasingly undermined.</p> <p>As a result of this imbalance, multinational companies have amassed huge profits in the globalised economy, notably through relocating to or sourcing from labour markets such as China where pay and conditions are kept low. Working people have been largely <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/28/business/28wages.html\">excluded</a> from the feast, as shown by the decline in the share of national income enjoyed by wages and salaries over the past three decades. The UK and US credit bubbles were inflated to record levels in order to make up for this shortfall in working people's pay packets, and it is the bursting of those bubbles that echoes all around us today.</p> <p>By the same token, decent remuneration of workers is now necessary both to avoid driving us deeper into recession and to restore a broader macroeconomic balance. Darling's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/09/tradeunions.policy\">suggestion</a> just last month that public-sector wages must be kept low to stave off the threat of inflation now sounds as if it came from another world.</p> <p>This rebalancing of relations between capital and labour is especially important now that recession is looming, not least because it is working people who will again be hit hardest by the economic downturn. As demand weakens and businesses find credit harder to come by, the pressure on jobs will build.</p> <p>The first signs of this are already appearing in Britain, where official figures show the largest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/unemploymentdata.recession\">rise</a> in unemployment in 16 years. The UK jobless total is forecast to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/14/economics.redundancy\">pass</a> the 2 million mark in the coming months for the first time in over a decade.</p> <p>In many of the world's poorest countries the impact will be even worse, and it will again be women workers who are most affected by the downturn. When the economies of south-east Asia collapsed under the financial crisis of 1997, the <a href=\"http://www.unescap.org/unis/press/f_01_98.htm\">feminisation of employment</a> which had been heralded as one of the achievements of the Asian economic miracle turned into a feminisation of unemployment almost overnight. Thousands of Thai and Indonesian women were forced into <a href=\"http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/last-cn.htm\">prostitution</a> as a result of losing their jobs.</p> <p>Today's financial crisis opens up the debate over what sort of economic system we wish to create for the future. Now that the merits of free-market capitalism have been exposed as a dangerous mirage, the world has the opportunity to develop a fairer system of international economic governance and to redistribute the spoils of globalisation.</p> <p>Preserving the current model, with all its failings and injustices, will simply perpetuate the imbalances which have led to today's crisis. A global economy based on decent work and a living wage for all women and men offers a real chance for a new beginning.</p>"
