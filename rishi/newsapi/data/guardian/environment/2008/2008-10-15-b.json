It was the best thing I could do for the planet, I felt - I was the sort of teenager who took the world very much to heart. Besides, I'd grown up in London, the diametrical opposite of the United States where teenagers learn to drive long before they begin to drink: none of my peers could drive, and no one cared (but we were all putting away bottles of cider like water).</p> <p>About 15 years later, newly pregnant, I began to rethink this policy. This was in the days before buggy-friendly buses: back then (all of seven years ago) you still had to get your baby out, fold up the buggy and then somehow wrestle your way on while magically finding a third hand with which to pay for your ticket. It didn't look like much fun. On top of which my husband had a car, and it was annoying not to be able to drive it. </p> <p>I'd already had one brief twitch of driving lessons, but now I embarked on the whole thing seriously, spending miserable hours in cul-de-sacs bumping from one pavement to another in search of the perfect three-point turn, or having serious rows with my husband whose patience turned out to be slightly thinner than a Rizzla. Finally I passed. But driving was still misery, and I only did it when I absolutely had to. So far, so good.<br><br>Slowly, however, I began to get the hang of the thing. I'd grown up with London traffic so found it completely unintimidating, and after a while I began to appreciate the roll and swing of pitting your wits against other drivers. I loved the fact that you could get in a car and just go \u2026 anywhere, to places which the public transport on which I'd always depended could not reach. The freedom was a little intoxicating. And then the final revelation came when I was invited to drive a Ferrari around <a href=\"http://www.silverstone.co.uk/php/home.html\">Silverstone</a>: my god, the roar of the engine, and the sensation of pushing your foot down and feeling your vehicle leap forward like a stallion \u2026 I was hooked. I wanted more.</p> <p>The problem is, of course, that to many environmentalists, cars are basically wrong. There is a whole <a href=\"http://www.carbusters.org/index.php\">lot of people</a> out there who would like to see the car vanish off the face of the earth. They are not being entirely unreasonable: after all, transport (which also includes aviation and shipping) is the fastest-growing contributor to carbon dioxide emissions. </p> <p>There are about 400-500m cars on the road today: projections about future ownership in the current economic climate are pretty pointless, but people have wondered if there might be 1bn cars around by 2020. Besides the monstrous cloud of CO2 floating up from this lot, there's the way that cars take over the world, turning front gardens into concrete garages, town centres into auto mashups, killing, poisoning, and generally behaving badly. Any right-thinking greenie, you might assume, would want to see an end to such a monstrosity.</p> <p>But not me. Cars might be awful, but they are also genius. Surely the less technophobic greenies must see that the car is a fearfully clever thing, a powerful mechanical servant which can transport us anywhere we want to go, while carrying tents and ovens and picnics and even playing your favourite music? I have separated out my personal crush on high-performance engines - that's clearly just my own little problem and even though I love them dearly I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that we should not be democratically entitled to a V8 engine in every car. The sound of those cylinders firing up gives you a rush in the same way that taking drugs does - it's addictive but not healthy. And the same is true, I am sad to say, of the cars themselves. </p> <p>But small cars, well-made cars, with the lowest possible emissions and high miles-per-gallon, these can serve a real purpose in a green society (there are some <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jun/18/travelandtransport.carbonemissions1\">ideas for green cars here</a>). In an ideal world, cars would not be for commuting or for taking the kids to school (you'd have a much better public transport infrastructure for those journeys): they should be load-bearing animals, used once or twice a week for specific tasks, or even shared with the neighbours and the rest of your family. High-performance cars would be taxed in line with the CO2 they produce, taxed heavily enough to compromise their existence as the market is doing now. Small cars would rule. The old brutes would slowly fade away.</p> <p>And for those of us who would still pine for the roar of a Ferrari bringing the hairs up on the back of their necks, perhaps we could form a little support group? Rewind our favourite bits of The Fast and The Furious? Watch Rendezvous and remnisce about the time an Aston Martin passed us in the street? Any takers?</p>",
  "<p>The new energy and climate change secretary Ed Miliband yesterday hinted he will today accept proposals from Lord Turner's climate change committee to increase Britain's target to cut carbon emissions from 60% to 80% by 2050. </p> <p>In his first interview since appointed secretary of state at the new Department for Energy and Climate change, Miliband insisted there would be no retreat from the government's climate change agenda in the face of the coming recession.</p> <p>While refusing to be specific about his response in the Commons today to Lord Adair Turner's report, he makes it clear that he shares the assumption that the science has changed since the original 60% reduction target was set in 2000. </p> <p>\"The central argument of the Stern report is that the costs of not acting are worse than the costs of acting, and the longer you leave it, the more expensive it gets. So I don't think there is an option not to act,\" he said.</p> <p>However, in a controversial move, he also told the Guardian that aviation should not be included in renewables targets, arguing: \"There is not a credible way of showing aviation can be driven by renewables.\" </p> <p>Miliband claimed that many of the new jobs of the future will be green jobs.</p> <p>He is due to respond today in the Commons to a recommendation from the government's climate change committee, chaired by Turner, that the government raise its target. Miliband admitted: \"It would not be true to say that after the events of the past three weeks that climate change is at the front of millions of people's minds. But politics is about leadership, and that means saying this is an incredibly important issue not just for us, but for our children.\" </p> <p>Much of that leadership must be shown by the EU, he insisted. \"By the end of the year the EU must reach agreement on the 2020 package on renewables and energy efficiency. That is how we can send a signal that we can get an agreement on a worldwide UN deal in Copenhagen at the end of next year. </p> <p>\"I am optimistic. I have got a real sense that people are not backing away in face of the costs.\" </p> <p>He absolutely insisted Britain was not retreating from the EU position that if a global deal was struck next year the required reduction in carbon emissions from the EU would automatically rise from 20% to 30%. \"We are absolutely committed to 30%. I want to be very clear about this. I am also very clear that if Britain is to be play an important role in international negotiations, then we have to lead by example,\" he said. </p> <p>He also urged the green movement to build a relationship with him based on good faith, saying: \"If there is an assumption of bad faith we are not going to get anywhere.\" He added that \"politicians cannot do this alone\". </p> <p>Looking at the wider debate on climate change, Miliband says: \"The argument about the science has been broadly won, but I do not think the argument on what individuals can do has yet been won.\" </p> <p>He said he thought government had to do more to make it much easier for people to be green in their daily lives, and admitted that he was not a paragon of virtue in his personal life, even if he was trying to use his car less. </p> <p>He said he was taken by his brother David's ideas about personal carbon allowances. \"What is very smart about this idea is transparency, the idea that we get to know what our personal carbon emissions are. I do not say that is the end of the story - that is the very important first step along the road to personal carbon allowances. As to the long term practicalities and how it would work, I don't know.\" </p> <p>On the imminent and fraught decision on whether to sanction the construction of a new coal-fired station at Kingsnorth, Kent, Miliband says he is not going announce a decision after 10 days in the job. But he added that the \"only long-term prospect for sustainable energy is around clean fuels. If we are going to meet our targets for 2050, we will have to do it with clean energy.\" </p> <p>On nuclear energy, he described himself as a \"sober-minded supporter,\" but admitted he \"was not raised in exactly a pro-nuclear family\". </p> <p>Due to meet energy companies for the first time yesterday, he said: \"I do not think it is fair that people on pre-payment meters pay more for their energy prices. Ofgem is right to say there has got to be action by the energy companies to stop this happening. I am expecting action to be taken swiftly, and if there is not, the government can legislate.\" </p> <p>He said he was also looking at the structure of tariffs so that people might no longer have to pay the highest price for the first tranche of gas and electricity they use. He said he was strongly expecting the energy companies not to pass on the cost of the energy efficiency, or lag the loft, programme announced by Gordon Brown last month.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown's lauded banking bail-out risked unravelling last night as Lloyds TSB lobbied the government to ease the repayment conditions attached to an emergency injection of taxpayers' money. </p> <p>The urgent attempt to renegotiate parts of the bail-out terms - and allow rescued banks to pay a dividend to their shareholders - came as the stock market wiped out all of the gains made in the euphoria following the bank rescue package, amid anxiety that the global economy was plunging into recession.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 index lost more than 7% - a 315-point fall and its fifth biggest percentage fall in history - after figures showed unemployment rose at its fastest rate for 17 years, the last time the UK was in recession.</p> <p>The chancellor, Alastair Darling, insisted last night that a deal was a deal on the bank bail-out, and he would not \"put billions into banks only to see it disappear out of the door [to shareholders] again\". He told BBC Newsnight: \"All the banks knew what was on offer. They knew the terms and conditions and they signed up to them.\"</p> <p>However, he added that it was up to the banks if they came up with a \"demonstrably better deal\". Last night a source indicated that there could be room for compromise on the government's insistence that all preference shares owned by the government be repaid before the bank could pay a dividend to shareholders. </p> <p>Yesterday's financial mood was further darkened when David Blanchflower, a labour market expert and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, said the 164,000 rise in the jobless total to 1.79m was \"truly horrendous and much worse than I had feared\". He added that he expected the jobless total to be more than 2 million by Christmas.</p> <p>Fears of deep recession also stalked Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed 733 points down after US retail sales suffered their biggest drop in more than three years.</p> <p>As Britain's dole queues lengthened and the likelihood of recession hardened, Gordon Brown went to Brussels to rally a European summit behind a call for concerted global action on the financial meltdown. The prime minister said his three-pronged plan to stabilise Britain's banks and his success in selling the blueprint to most of Europe at the weekend was stage one of his campaign. Now, he said, world leaders needed to hold a summit by the end of the year to write a new rulebook for the globalised economy.</p> <p>He said the Financial Services Authority was considering whether to raise the limit on compensation paid to those individuals whose savings were lost in a bank collapse. The European commission is proposing an EU-wide \u20ac100,000 (\u00a377,000) guarantee on deposits, with the sum being repaid within three days.</p> <p>But while Brown was being feted in Brussels for his bail-out plan, which has been replicated across Europe and copied in the US, banks involved were trying to alter the terms attached to the \u00a337bn of taxpayers' money earmarked to buy shares in Lloyds TSB, HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland.</p> <p>Lloyds TSB, whose takeover of HBOS was personally brokered by Brown, was understood to be keen to alter the conditions attached to the terms on which repayments are to be made to the taxpayer. </p> <p>Lloyds' shares have been driven lower by concern that it would be weakened by the takeover of HBOS, which in turn forced Lloyds into taking part in the bank bail-out package. Even though HBOS was one of only two FTSE 100 shares to end the day in positive territory, taxpayers are sitting on losses of more than \u00a32bn because the government is offering to pay more for the shares than the 85p at which they closed last night. Lloyds was also trading at 150.2p, below the 173.7p at which the government has agreed to buy shares, while RBS ended at 65p, 0.5p below the price paid by the government.</p> <p>Under the government's bail-out terms Lloyds and RBS are unable to pay dividends to their shareholders until preference shares sold to the government are paid off. This could take up to five years - something that Lloyds shareholders are particularly angry about, as they are used to receiving healthy twice-yearly payments from the bank.</p> <p>It is thought Lloyds is looking for ways to restructure its capital raising, perhaps by selling preference shares to investors other than the government, or even increasing the \u00a34.5bn issue of ordinary shares it also has planned.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that the European commission forced the government to ban the dividend pay-outs on the three banks taking part in the bail-out as the price for winning its approval under EU competition rules. It is understood that this was one of up to 10 conditions imposed by Brussels on the government as it sought clearance for its \u00a3500bn capital injection, debt guarantee and liquidity funding scheme last weekend.</p> <p>Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, and her senior officials insisted upon the dividend ban as long as the government held preference shares in the affected banks. They said this would act as an incentive for the banks to repay the capital as soon as possible.</p> <p>Initially, it is understood, the government suggested that penal interest rates would act as an adequate incentive, but Brussels toughened this condition up along with other UK proposals during the negotiations which began in the middle of last week. The EU also imposed a limit on a rise in lending by the part-nationalised banks which the government had ordered to resume lending at 2007 levels.</p>",
  "<p>The City is revolting. It wants Royal Bank of Scotland and a merged Lloyds TSB-HBOS to have the freedom to pay dividends on their ordinary shares. The Treasury's plan is too punishing, it is argued. Look how gentle the US authorities are being with their banks, who will pay a fixed interest rate of 5% on the preference shares sold to the state, not the 12% rate as in Britain. </p> <p>This grumble was predictable and the Treasury seems inclined to retreat from Monday's terms in one important area: a one-year ban on dividends appears likely to remain in force, but RBS and Lloyds-HBOS could then negotiate to resume payments thereafter, even if they haven't repaid the preference shares. But there would be a negotiation. The banks would have offer taxpayers something in return. For example, they could sell assets to improve their capital ratios further, thereby reducing the risks to the taxpayer.</p> <p>Fair enough, but let's hope this compromise is not the first of many, because the broad principles of Monday's rescue plan are correct. So what if the US is seeking a coupon of 5% on its preference shares? Those are sweetheart terms and there is no reason to copy them. The market price for bank preference shares is a coupon of about 9% to 12% and the taxpayer deserves to receive the going rate.</p> <p>Moreover, placing restrictions on dividend payments seems reasonable. The taxpayer could be investing \u00a337bn here. Part of the capital is designed to be a buffer against future write-offs; but the other purpose is to encourage banks to start lending again. We don't want the surplus capital to sit idly within banks' balance sheets or to be siphoned off to satisfy current shareholders. The banks must get back to performing their essential role of transmitting money around the economy and allocating financial resources efficiently. That's how a market system operates.</p> <p>Everybody knows what sits behind this argy-bargy over dividends - it is Lloyds's problem in convincing its own shareholders that the HBOS takeover is worthwhile. But, as matters stand, it is Lloyds's problem, not the Treasury's. Lloyds had the chance to wriggle out of the deal at the weekend and chose not to. Yes, it is performing a useful service by buying HBOS, but let's not forget that it has been given a sweetener in the form of a waiver from scrutiny by the competition authorities.</p> <p>Of course, the Treasury would have to pick up the pieces if Lloyds shareholders vote down the deal, probably by nationalising HBOS, but we're not there yet. So, yes, allow Lloyds to apply to pay dividends in a year's time if it helps the HBOS takeover to proceed without a hitch. But there is no reason to soften the terms of the rescue package further. The banks, and their shareholders, have to understand that there is cost to be paid for guaranteed support from the state.</p> <p><strong>Turning nasty</strong></p> <p>As the banking crisis recedes, the news from the real economy turns nasty. The economic slowdown in China is already so sharp that Rio Tinto, one of the world's biggest miners, is considering cutting capital expenditure. If you are optimistic, like Rio, you will argue that a slowdown in China from growth of 12% to 9% next year is hardly a disaster from a long-term perspective. But will 9% really be achieved?</p> <p>Many economists are expecting a lower figure, because the notion that China could \"decouple\" from the slowdown in the west seems weaker by the day. It is clear that Chinese economy is still dependent on exports, however much we would like to believe that its consumers could fill the hole in spending that will be left by shoppers in the US and Europe. That route to global recovery seems closed, not least because the Chinese authorities see the need to control credit in their own economy. </p> <p>For the likes of Rio, the immediate future looks uncertain. Its shares have fallen two-thirds from their peak, roughly in line with the sector. Prices of industrial metals are falling and, in the case of aluminium, have already dropped below levels where high-cost producers can earn a profit. Copper may soon be close to that point too.</p> <p>Miners always tell us that, when prices drop to the marginal cost of production, a floor should be established because high-cost producers are forced to close. Life rarely works so simply, however. In practice, state-subsidised producers always seem to cling on longer than the models say they should.</p> <p>None of which destroys the long-term bullish case for commodities, which is built on the demand that China and India will generate as they industrialise. One school of thought says that miners' cuts in capital expenditure today will feed a new commodities boom in five years' time. That is possible. But five years is a long time to wait. No wonder investors are fleeing the mining sector: the next two years look very difficult.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Industry giants such as Apple, Dell and HP can turn a notebook launch into a global event, but that's not the sort of thing a Taiwanese company would normally attempt. Taiwan does cheap, not chic. But having what looked like a hot product in the S101 netbook, Asus decided to have a go, and paid to take the world's tech press to a fashion show in Taipei.</p> <p>The event was somewhat short of chic. And as you'd expect from a first attempt, Asus had a lot to learn about herding recalcitrant journalists.</p> <p>The potential benefits to Asus of pulling off this kind of event are enormous. It is turning itself from a motherboard supplier and contract manufacturer - making portable PCs for other companies - into a tier-one supplier with a global brand name. If it can do that, customers will pay more for its products. </p> <p><strong>Fashion show function</strong></p> <p>The S101 is a case in point. Asus is becoming known to European consumers following the success of its netbooks, starting with the little Eee PC700 - but what caught the eye was its \u00a3200 price. With the \u00a3449 Eee S101, what catches the eye is that it's really thin and, as another journalist said, \"gorgeous\". It could have been made by, or for, Apple or Sony. It didn't look out of place in a fashion show. Functionally, the S101 is just an Eee PC 1000 at a higher price. But you might be willing pay extra for something you'd be proud to carry.</p> <p>That message was spelled out by Stan Shih, the founder of Acer and father of the Taiwanese computer industry. At a business seminar in Taipei, reported by Elizabeth Tchii in the Taipei Times, he said the future was in branding, no matter how difficult it was to achieve. \"The days of doing OEM and ODM\" - making boxes and designs for others to put their own brand name on - \"are numbered,\" he said. \"In order to elevate Taiwan to the global business scene with added value, we have to invest in branding right now. This is our social responsibility.\"</p> <p>It's a path Acer has taken, under the Italian management of Gianfranco Lanci, partly by buying known US brands such as Gateway and Packard Bell. It's a path China's Legend, now called Lenovo, has taken by buying IBM's PC division. But Asus is trying to do it by transforming the company.</p> <p>Jonney Shih, who started Asus in 1989 after a dozen years at Acer, says Asus was intended to be \"a small but beautiful company\" based on its engineering prowess. It became known for technical innovation in motherboards, but he says the company also tried to make them look beautiful. In 1997, the company went from motherboards into notebooks as an OEM and ODM supplier, then launched products under its own brand name.</p> <p>According to Jonney, the company was named Asus after an engineer suggested Pegasus. He truncated it because he wanted a name that started with an A. They've now spun off the OEM and ODM businesses into a separate company called Pegatron, thus using the spare half of the flying horse's name. Pegatron's offices are visible from Asus's doorstep, but the split means Asus isn't competing directly against its own customers.</p> <p>Again, Asus is following Acer, which split off its OEM business into Wistron on the way to becoming a global brand name. By contrast, the two giants of Taiwan's OEM business, Quanta and Compal, who manufacture notebooks for Apple, Dell, HP and Lenovo, remain almost unknown. But the fear in Taiwan is that OEM contracts could be moved to companies in China, Vietnam and emerging countries which, according to HTC's founder Peter Chou, are catching up fast. </p> <p>Of course, brand building doesn't mean much unless you also have distinctive products, and this isn't easy in the PC business. Asus is therefore trying to innovate. It is, for example, making power-saving \"green\" motherboards with low emissions and fewer hazardous chemicals than regulations require. It is trying to outperform the competition with its own Super Hybrid Engine and power-saving technologies. It is experimenting with new designs such as the Eee PC and the tiny Eee Box, a desktop PC that will soon have a battery-powered version.</p> <p>In software, Asus provides the Eee Box and S101 with a Linux-based pre-boot system that enables users to get online and do email without waiting for Windows. With Microsoft, it has taken part in the Vista Velocity and Hero PC programmes, and is optimising XP for the fastest possible startup times. Henry Yeh, general manager of Asus's notebook business unit, says the company doesn't slow its machines down with software it's paid to preinstall: users can install the applications they want via a console.</p> <p>Asus is also innovating by using natural materials for notebook finishes. It tried leather three or four years ago, and designer Michelle Hsiao says it is now working with wood, a process that will culminate in the release of a bamboo notebook.</p> <p><strong>Porsche or Hyundai?</strong></p> <p>Yeh says that Asus has built 200 units to introduce the bamboo notebook to the market, then \"we will see customer feedback\". The shift upmarket includes a drive for quality. As Jonathan Tsang, president of sales and marketing, puts it: \"Volume is not everything. Quality is everything. We're trying to make ourselves the most admired enterprise in the digital era.\" That's the company's new vision. He says: \"Do you want to be Porsche or Hyundai?\" It goes along with a corporate philosophy that demands Humility and Integrity (\"Do not cheat!). Which is a refreshing change from: \"Don't get caught!\"</p> <p>Of course, success requires more than quality products, and stepping up marketing and press relations is part of the job. Hauling in jet-lagged journalists from India, Russia, Italy etc is just a start. Asus says it will sell more than 6m notebook PCs this year and 5m netbooks, making it a top five portable supplier with a group turnover of more than $20bn (\u00a311.4bn). The Asus name could soon mean much more than \"Big in Taiwan\".</p>",
  "<p>The strengthening dollar should help boost Pearson's earnings this year, the publishing group said yesterday as it reported resilient sales in the face of looming recession. </p> <p>The UK-listed Pearson generates about 60% of its sales in the US, much of it from its education business, and so suffers when the dollar is weak, as it was last year and earlier this year. </p> <p>Over the nine months to the end of September, the pound averaged $1.95, compared with $1.99 in the same period last year, and by the end of last month it stood at $1.83. </p> <p>The owner of the Financial Times and Penguin books said every five-cent movement in the value of the dollar was worth a penny in earnings per share (EPS). As long as the dollar continues to strengthen, the company expects this year's EPS to be at the top end of estimates, which range from 46p to 52.8p.</p> <p>Pearson said overall sales were up 8% on a constant currency basis in the nine months to the end of September, with operating profit up 11%. On an underlying basis, excluding the effect of currency movements, acquisitions and disposals, revenue rose only 3%.</p> <p>The company, apparently unaffected by fears of a global recession, reiterated its guidance.</p> <p>Pearson's chief executive, Marjorie Scardino, said: \"We're naturally cautious about global economic conditions, but we have good trading momentum, innovative products, resilient businesses and a strong balance sheet. With those advantages, we believe we are in good shape to prosper and strengthen our company, even through these turbulent times.\"</p> <p>However, some analysts warned there could be difficult times for Pearson in the immediate future.</p> <p>Jonathan Helliwell, a Cazenove analyst, said in a note: \"For longer-term investors, Pearson offers the attractions of a well-positioned core education business, potentially valuable assets in financial publishing, a strong balance sheet and improving management execution. </p> <p>\"Near-term, though, we expect an increasingly difficult trading environment for education and financial in 2009.\" </p> <p>Sales at Pearson's education business, which provides textbooks and testing for US pupils, were up 10% on constant currency terms, and by 1% on an underlying basis over the nine-month period.</p> <p>Pearson is hoping the division will weather the economic downturn, as educational spending has tended to hold up in previous recessions. Pearson's sales and profits are traditionally weighted to the second half of the year because of the seasonality of education budgets.</p> <p>Sales at FT Group were up 11%, helped by a 1% rise in advertising revenue at the FT Publishing division, where total revenue rose 14%.</p> <p>\"Operating profits continue to show good growth, as expected, and for the full year we expect FT Publishing to increase profits even if there is no growth in advertising revenues,\" Pearson added. At Interactive Data, the financial information arm of the FT Group, sales were up 8%.</p> <p>Penguin reported sales growth of 3% as it aims for double-digit margins over the full year. The business is pinning its hopes on titles such as the TV chef Jamie Oliver's Jamie's Ministry of Food, Jeremy Clarkson's For Crying Out Loud and the new Patricia Cornwell thriller, Scarpetta, to spearhead sales in the crucial pre-Christmas quarter.</p> <p>Shares in Pearson slipped 8p to 551.5p, on a day when the FTSE 100 fell by 7.2%.</p>",
  "<p>Deep despondency gripped the markets on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday as dismal economic figures reinforced expectations of a global recession, sending shares into another historic tailspin.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 index of leading shares suffered its fifth biggest fall in percentage terms as it slumped by 7.2%, or 315 points, to 4079.6. That reversed more than half of the gains seen on Monday and Tuesday after large-scale bank rescues by governments around the world.</p> <p>On Wall Street, stocks fared even worse. The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted by 733 points to 8,577 - its second worst points drop on record, exceeded only by a fall of 777 two weeks ago. In percentage terms, the day's decline of 7.9% was the worst since 1987.</p> <p>Tim Hughes, head of sales trading at IG Index, said: \"Gains made on the back of the banking rescue plans from the US and European countries have been wiped out as investors began to take the impact of slowing economic growth on board.\"</p> <p>In Britain, figures showed that joblessness had risen at its fastest pace since the recession of the early 1990s.</p> <p>Across the Atlantic, retail sales fell by 1.2% at US shops during September, a far sharper fall than expected. \"Consumers are continuing to move away from discretionary spending, particularly big-ticket items,\" said Anika Khan, an economist at the US bank Wachovia. \"We're seeing a more broad-based decline.\"</p> <p>Traders said that hedge funds accelerated yesterday's falls by dumping billions of pounds worth of investments to meet clients' withdrawals or to protect against risk. A prominent $18bn US fund, SAC Capital run by the billionaire magnate Steve Cohen, has reportedly \"gone to cash\" by liquidating about half of its portfolio.</p> <p>A report by the Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research suggested that 350 hedge funds have collapsed so far this year and the average fund lost 8% of its value in the third quarter.</p> <p>Money markets, however, continued to ease - the daily fixing of Libor rates in London showed that the interbank interest rates in dollars, euros and pounds fell across the board for the second day running.</p> <p>In London, mining stocks fell sharply on worries that a slowing global economy would hit demand for raw materials such as iron ore. The Baltic Dry shipping cost index saw another big drop yesterday which took it to its lowest for more than five years. Shipping analysts said the credit crunch was hitting world trade hard and reducing the demand for tankers.</p> <p>The price of a barrel of crude oil dropped below $75 for the first time since September last year, pulling energy stocks down heavily.

That reversed more than half of Monday's and Tuesday's gains after governments around the world rescued some banks.</p> <p>Tim Hughes, head of sales trading at IG Index, said: \"Gains made on the back of the banking rescue plans from the US and European countries have been wiped out today as investors began to take the impact of slowing economic growth on board. The comedown after the euphoria of the multi-billion pound bail-outs earlier this week seemed inevitable, although a sharp rise in the latest UK unemployment figures hasn't helped matters,\" he said, referring to figures showing joblessness had risen at its fastest pace since the recession of the early 1990s.</p> <p>Mining stocks fell sharply on worries that a slowing global economy would hit demand for raw materials such as iron ore. The Baltic Exchange dry shipping index which measures the cost of transporting commodities fell to its lowest for more than five years. Shipping analysts said the credit crunch was hitting world trade hard and reducing the demand for tankers.</p> <p>As the FTSE 100 closed the Dow Jones industrial average in New York was also lower, down 3.5% at just under 9,000. The Dow was hurt by very weak US retail sales which dealers took as another sign that the world's biggest economy was heading into recession. Weak profit numbers from JP Morgan Chase also weighed on the market. And Ben Bernanke, head of the Federal Reserve, warned that even if the markets had now been stabilised, economic recovery would not follow swiftly.</p> <p>But the daily fixing of Libor rates in London showed that the interbank interest rates in dollars, euros and pounds fell across the board for the second day running and the European central bank announced a relaxation of its collateral requirements. Meanwhile oil prices fell by 5% to their lowest for 13 months. US light crude futures were trading last night at around $75 a barrel.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown built on his best week as prime minister last night by endeavouring to set the global agenda on the international banking crisis and to inoculate the financial system against a relapse.</p> <p>The prime minister surprised an EU summit by unveiling proposals for a major summit which he said should take place within weeks to rewrite the rulebook for the world economy.</p> <p>Stepping up his campaign for a new \"international financial architecture\" that would banish the threat of renewed meltdown, Brown sought to rally a summit of 27 European leaders behind his scheme, also supported by Nicolas Sarkozy, French president and current president of the European council.</p> <p>Sarkozy said the global summit should take place in New York. Brown said it should take place next month or in December and claimed there was widespread support for the conference.</p> <p>\"There is now general agreement on a meeting with an agenda for far-reaching reform,\" said Brown after talking to George Bush, his European peers, and the leaders of China, Brazil, and Australia in recent days.</p> <p>Fresh from a triumphant summit of 16 European leaders in Paris on Sunday which adopted the \"Brown plan\" as the model for salvaging the European banking sector from collapse and kickstarting the paralysed markets, the prime minister yesterday lobbied the other 11 countries of the EU to follow his lead and announced that it was already time to move on to \"stage two\" in tackling the global financial and worsening economic crisis.</p> <p>\"Stage one has been stabilising the financial system. We also have to move to stage two,\" said Brown, who unusually was the first leader to arrive for last night's summit and spent all day yesterday locked in one-on-one meetings with European commission officials and Scandinavian and central European government chiefs.</p> <p>Brown sprung a seven-page paper on last night's summit, outlining his remedies for the global crisis. In doing so, he risked the accusation that he was hijacking the summit agenda at the last minute and stealing the limelight from Sarkozy. British officials said the new proposals had been shared with the French in advance.</p> <p>The proposals are designed to set in motion the most far reaching reforms to world financial institutions since the Bretton Woods meeting of 1944 which led to the creation of the IMF and the World Bank. The conference to rewrite the global financial rules would also agree on a new world trade deal, following the collapse of negotiations in July, in order to remove the dangers of stronger protectionism as the world moves into recession. </p> <p>Brown demanded: </p> <p>\u2022 an early-warning system for the world economy to ensure that problems are anticipated earlier; </p> <p>\u2022 a framework to ensure crises are dealt with better as they arise; </p> <p>\u2022 cross-border colleges of supervisors to monitor the world's top 30 companies and financial institutions that trade across borders. </p> <p>\"It is a response to unique times, unprecedented circumstances and the need to think in unconventional ways about what is the right thing to do,\" the prime minister said.</p> <p>\"I want to see a timetable for agreeing these proposals over the next few weeks and months.\" </p> <p>The group of international regulators for the world's top 30 banks would seek to prevent a repeat of the current financial meltdown, while Brown's vision of a new Bretton Woods handed the key role of investigating and supervising the impact of the financial sector on the real economy. </p> <p>It would work hand in glove with the G7's current financial stability forum (FSF), comprising treasury officials, central bankers and regulators, to deliver early warnings of systemic risk to economic and financial stability and propose measures to combat it. </p> <p>The FSF, based in Basel, Switzerland would be expanded to include members from important emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil, Russia and South Africa. </p> <p>The prime minister demanded strict regulation of all financial market players, including hedge funds and others operating in the \"shadow\" banking system that have helped provoke the current crisis with complex derivative products.</p> <p>The French proposals for last night's summit included action to curb executive excess, saying that the pay and bonuses of company bosses should reflect \"their real performance\" and the success of their businesses.</p> <p>Earnings should not lead to \"excessive risk-taking or extreme concentration on short-term objectives.\"</p> <p>Sarkozy told the summit that no financial institution should escape regulation and supervision.</p> <p>\"We must also work to eliminate the grey areas that undermine our efforts at coordination, in this case the offshore centres,\" he said.</p> <p>Brown hopes that agreement among the EU 27 last night would allow the four EU members of the G8 - Britain, France, Germany and Italy - to present a united front at the proposed world summit which could include the US president-elect as it would take place after the November 4 presidential election.</p>",
  "<p>Independent Radio News has dumped its long-time supplier, ITN, in favour of Sky News. The deal, announced yesterday, gives Sky News a virtual monopoly in the commercial radio news market.</p> <p>IRN supplies news to more than 250 stations in the UK, nearly every commercial radio broadcaster. The few stations that do not subscribe to ITN include former Chrysalis stations Heart and Galaxy - now part of Global Radio - which already use Sky News.</p> <p>Global Radio is the majority shareholder in IRN. Other shareholders include Bauer Radio - formerly Emap Radio - and ITN, which has a minority stake.</p> <p>IRN was founded in 1973, on the day commercial radio launched in Britain with London talk station LBC. Now based in the basement of ITN's headquarters in Gray's Inn Road, London, IRN provides 24-hour national and international news. Sky News was previously seen as a rival, particularly after it bagged the contract to supply Chrysalis Radio in 2005. Now the two have joined forces in what IRN's managing director, John Perkins, said was a difficult decision.</p> <p>This is not the first time Sky News has chipped away at ITN's powerbase. Four years ago Channel Five switched to Sky News, dumping ITN, which had produced the network's bulletins since Five's launch in 1997. The Five contract gave Sky News its first peak-time foothold in terrestrial TV news, something it had been trying to secure since its launch in 1989.</p> <p>ITN's chief executive, Mark Wood, said the company was \"clearly very disappointed\" that IRN had opted for Sky News. \"ITN's proposal was for a continued high-quality, tightly costed service that our client stations have come to expect from us,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Five months after countries pledged to give more than $12bn to address the global food emergency, less than $1bn has been delivered, says Oxfam. In a report to coincide with <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/worldfoodday/en/\">World Food day</a>, the international agency berates rich countries for failing to respond speedily or adequately to soaring food and fuel prices.<br> \"Rich countries are directing their attention to high fuel prices and turmoil in the financial sector but the number of malnourished people in the world rose by 44 million people in 2008. Nearly one billion people are now going hungry. When you consider the speed of the world's response to the credit crisis, the delay in acting is shocking\", said an <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/\">Oxfam</a> spokesman.</p> <p>In a separate report, <a href=\"http://www.careinternational.org.uk/\">Care International</a> said that at least 6.4 million people in Ethiopia now need emergency food aid and that Somalia is facing a food crisis \"unseen since the famine of the early 1990s\". </p> <p>\"Drought, conflict, and rising food prices have left more than 17 million people in the Horn of Africa sliding into a full-blown humanitarian crisis. These countries are heading into the peak hunger season when cereal prices are at their highest, and families have no stocks left from the previous harvest\", said Jonathan Mitchell, Care's emergency director.</p> <p>The Oxfam report says that while staple food prices have come down since their peak in July, they remain stuck at levels far higher than the long-term average. \"This is not a fleeting crisis.\"</p> <p>Barbara Stocking, director of Oxfam GB, said: \"It is shocking that the international community has failed to organise itself to respond adequately to this. The UN taskforce produced a good plan \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.ifad.org/operations/food/documents/cfa/cfa_draft.pdf\">Comprehensive Framework for Action</a> \u2013 but there is still not clear leadership to implement it.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Developing countries are being bombarded with different initiatives and asked to produce multiple plans for different donors. We need to see one coordinated international response, led by the UN, which channels funds urgently to those in need, and leads on implementation of the longer-term reforms\".</p> <p>The Oxfam report contrasts the global food crisis with the record profits being made by the world's largest agribusiness and seed companies. \"[US food company] Bunge saw its profits increase by $583m (\u00a3333m) between April and July, Thailand's Charoen Pokphand Foods is forecasting a 237% increase in sales, Nestl\u00e9's global sales rose 8.9% January to June and Tesco has reported profits up 10% on last year. France's Carrefour and Wal-Mart in the US say that food sales are the main factor sustaining their increases in profits\". </p> <p>The world's largest seed companies have all seen profits grow by over 25% in the second quarter of 2008. </p> <p>However, poor countries have also failed to come up with adequate answers to food price rises, says the report. Many countries responded by banning rice exports. But this, says the report, resulted in only limited curbs on inflation and has contributed to a shortage of supplies on the world market. </p> <p>Other countries have forced controls on markets or slashed import tariffs, but this could pose serious future threats to infant industries and paralysis of the food supply chain.</p> <p>Oxfam recommends that poor countries invest more in agriculture and protect small-scale producers. It urges rich countries to stop pressing for rapid liberalisation of poor countries' economies in trade negotiations and global agreements. </p> <p>\"The food crisis and the fate of 17 million people in Africa is being pushed down the list of priorities. Add to this the global financial crisis, and things could hardly be any worse. The perfect storm just got more perfect\", said Mitchell.</p>",
  "<p>The City and Wall Street face far more than a dire financial crisis. For underlying it is, literally, a demoralisation of the markets and their players. The real \"moral hazard\" is far deeper than the damage to capitalist theory from the state bailing out surfeited losers. The question now is whether more regulation can stop the pack of cards collapsing again.</p> <p>The City has probably never been very ethical. Insider dealing, for example, has always been a scourge. But when I went there as a young lawyer in 1964 it was not as detached, arrogant and doctrinaire as it is now. Firms were much smaller (partnerships limited to 20), more stable and often independent. Above all, personal reputation - ethical as well as functional - meant everything. It was a powerful constraint on conduct. The City take- over panel, for example, functioned well without any statutory backing.</p> <p>Today ethical reputation and peer pressure are enfeebled. For example, many top investment banks - Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs among them - were convicted of extensive dotcom frauds but their businesses were scarcely affected. And when KPMG in the US was convicted three years ago of conspiring with clients to defraud the Internal Revenue Service, KPMG UK continued to garner government contracts. Under pressure, ends too often justify means (short selling et al). Hyper-cleverness too easily trumps probity (eg AIG).</p> <p>These developments stem partly from global markets dominated by huge, faceless corporations, with declining loyalty to anyone or anything. Ownership of City firms, once fiercely cherished, is now a matter of almost universal indifference so long as the bonuses or dividends are right. The basis of shareholding has been generally reduced to brute concern about returns and gains. In such a climate of non-concern, can one be surprised at rampant amorality.</p> <p>Of course people remain people and many struggle to soften the extremes of capitalist fundamentalism and the growing disconnectedness from the societies they service. The latter starts with intense competitiveness within and between firms which demands obsessional commitment, leaving little time for family, friends and hinterland, let alone the public realm. Imbalanced, over-narrow lives do not engender ethical sensitivity. The City has thus become a ghetto where greed (never mentioned) is all but an absolute good, selfishness applauded and altruism banished, except from corporate social responsibility programmes which, frankly, are invariably marginal.</p> <p>The cry since the crisis took hold has been for more regulation. Yet the City today is regulated more heavily than ever before. The financial services and companies legislation plus a plethora of related controls (many deriving from the EU) run to many thousands of pages and have spawned a new bureaucracy overseen by the FSA and underpinned by armies of lawyers and accountants. Some think the goose is already half-dead. </p> <p>As one who has sat on each side of the triangular regulatory table - as lawyer, legislator and City company director - I assert that better regulation can only be a limited part of any deliverable answer. Look at non-financial crime. If more legislation was the cure, we would by now be crime-free. Ironically, the very accretion of regulation over recent years has seriously weakened the organic will of the City to effectively police and address its own ills. But address them it must if it is to avoid regulatory suffocation and/or further self-induced implosion.</p> <p>Although prospects look bleak, there may still be enough strong, farseeing City people to lead a cleansing yet shrewd reformation. That I believe should be underpinned by a City review commission of all the talents with an uncomfortably wide remit. Now is the time.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Phillips (Lord Phillips of Sudbury) is a City solicitor <br><a href=\"mailto:andrew_w_phillips@yahoo.com\">andrew_w_phillips@yahoo.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Japan is no longer the force it once was in the global videogame industry - and a lot of its executives are asking themselves why. In May, Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima admitted that Japanese development had fallen a few paces behind the west. And just last week, Yoichi Wada, president of Square Enix, the publisher of the Final Fantasy series, also noted that Japan is no longer the market leader. What could explain such a fall from grace?</p> <p>It's all about the PC. In Japan, there's really no mass consumer market for home computers - people are more likely to check email or surf the web on their phones, and will play games on consoles or handhelds. But the easy availability of cheap PCs, together with a strongly collaborative online community, has revolutionised game development in the west. This began in the mid 1990s, when the creators of first-person shooters like Doom, Unreal and Half-Life made their development tools available to fans. Quickly, bedroom coders started designing their own levels, swapping ideas via the internet and forming mini-development studios to build ever more elaborate content. Game developers were thrilled - the community input gave their games longevity. None of this could have happened in a culture where home coding on a cheap PC was not particularly common.</p> <p>We're seeing a new phase of the home coding revolution. On the indie scene, small groups of home developers create simple downloadable or browser-based games and then distribute them via websites like Kongregate and Newgrounds. These games spread virally across the web, but they're also being picked up by the big console manufacturers. Two of this year's best Xbox Live games - platformer Braid and RPG action title Castle Crashers - come from the indie community; the next biggie will be daft scrolling fighter, Dishwasher: Dead Samurai by lone coder James Silva, who blogs about development at <a href=\"http://skasoftware.wordpress.com\">skasoftware.wordpress.com</a>. Meanwhile, just released on WiiWare in the US, World of Goo is a bizarre structure-modelling sim, originally conceived for the Experimental Gameplay Project.</p> <p>Japanese publishers do have a history of supporting important offbeat projects - LocoRoco, Katamari Damacy and Lumines spring to mind. However, these tend to be the work of well-positioned creative directors, working within \"legitimate\" internal studios. At the same time, Japan does have an indie games scene - the \"doujin shmup\" is a style of fast-paced scrolling shooter, created by small teams and distributed online - the best-known examples are the truly hypnotic Warning Forever and anything by Kenta Cho (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/gblog5\">bit.ly/gblog5</a>). </p> <p>The orthodox industry seems to be showing little interest in these upstarts - perhaps because of the lack of a PC culture. But if the two sectors can meet, form a community and start sharing ideas, Japan can rise again.</p>",
  "<p>The credit checker Experian is restructuring to help bank clients collect debts - after years of providing credit-scoring services to help them lend cash.</p> <p>Once part of the GUS stores empire, the company generates more than 40% of its business from bank customers and yesterday said a quick reaction to the looming recession was important.</p> <p>\"We are taking positive steps to adapt to the market,\" said a spokesman. \"We are focusing less on credit scoring for lenders and more on recovery of delinquent loans and returning cash. \"</p> <p>He denied the takeovers under way in the sector would hit Experian's business. \"When banks consolidate they usually integrate their IT, and that gives Experian opportunities.\"</p> <p>Experian was posting a six-month trading update showing a 13% increase in revenue in the first half, with acquisitions helping offset flat revenue growth at the core credit services division.</p> <p>The company said plans to sell the PriceGrabber price comparison website had been abandoned. The division, which cost $500m (\u00a3286m) in 2005, was growing and profitable. Experian put PriceGrabber on sale earlier this year after deciding it was not a core business because the site did not generate information about shoppers that could be used for other purposes.</p> <p>Experian's US-based chief executive, Don Roberts, said the credit crunch meant there were no takers because buyers could not find financing: \"We received many expressions of interest but, given the financing environment, these did not convert into bankable transactions.\" </p> <p>Roberts was hopeful the bank bail-outs launched by the US and UK governments would boost retail credit volume. \"Anything that helps stabilise the banking environment will benefit Experian. We want to see healthy, well-capitalised clients and a free flow of credit,\" he said.</p> <p>Experian has agreed to sell French credit card processing businesses for \u20ac203m (\u00a3159m) to the private equity group Advent International and Doc@post, a subsidiary of La Poste, the French postal service. The disposals will generate a net \u20ac150m, which it will use to cut debt.</p> <p>Shares in Experian fell 8% to 300.5p on disappointment that the PriceGrabber sale had been ditched.</p>",
  "<p>Our bodies are being measured for critical comparison like never before. Biometric devices prevent gambling addicts from playing casinos and bar intruders from nurseries. And the border security of the western world could soon depend on an emerging technology that offers security solutions for a post-9/11 world tormented by fears of terrorism, fraud and crime.</p> <p>Computerised examinations of our wrinkly digital extremities, the peculiar shapes of our faces and uniquely patterned irises will be used more and more often to authenticate our use of our passports, ID cards, mobile phones and laptops - as well as regulating access to offices and building sites.</p> <p><strong>Too clever by half?</strong></p> <p>The science behind the industry is advancing rapidly. Two UK universities - Kent and Robert Gordon in Aberdeen - this year established specialist MSc courses in biometrics and security. False rejection rates - when machines fail to recognise pre-registered passengers or staff - are plummeting. But is there a danger that the ingenuity of these applications will outrun the capacity of this young technology? The moment of truth is about to arrive in the UK with deployment of the first major government biometric programmes: ID cards (initially for foreign workers) carrying fingerprint records will be launched next month, while automated immigration gates this summer began recognition checks on passengers carrying the new generation of passports arriving at Manchester airport. And next week, the biggest showcase for the industry in Europe, Biometrics 2008, opens in London (at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, Westminster, from October 21 to 23). A Home Office minister and European police officials will participate. More than ever, businesses are under to pressure to prove that the technology is both resilient and yet also politically sensitive.</p> <p>A research paper produced for the show by Simon France of the University of Kent and the UK Biometrics Institute, confirms that systems are becoming more complex to foil spoofing attacks (where people masquerade as others) and to reduce the error rate. The trend, he says, is to employ \"multimodal\" biometrics - security systems that incorporate several types of measurements. British passports now carry chips recording facial recognition data but will eventually add fingerprints. \"Liveness\" testing, to prevent fraud or spoofing, is increasingly built in. Iris scans, for example, check that the image of a human eye is from a convex surface, is glossy and/or wet and that the muscles oscillate at high frequency.</p> <p>There are still problems, France observes. \"Having a laboratory-based solution is one thing, but achieving acceptable failure rates in the real world can be quite another. Transitory changes [illness, damage] or permanent changes such as ageing can cause identification decisions to become invalid over time. Equally challenging is the presence of varying lighting conditions, dirt or moisture.\"</p> <p>In facial recognition systems - which are slowly being integrated into CCTV networks - research is turning to the addition of 3D images to boost performance. A Dutch scientist, Dr Arnout Ruifrok, will discuss at the show the problem that current technologies have difficulty interpreting non-frontal images and even zoomed-in on faces more than four metres from the camera. Iris recognition - a British technology invented by Professor John Daugman, a Cambridge scientist - is developing methods of reading the unique patterns in our eyes at a distance.</p> <p>Its accuracy helps pre-enrolled frequent flyers pass quickly through congested UK airport security checks. It has lost out, however, chiefly because so many existing police and identity databases already contain fingerprint and photographic records.</p> <p>Voice recognition, palm prints and ear shapes are also being pursued for commercial development. The global biometrics market, according to a pre-credit crunch estimate by ABI Research, is worth around $3bn (\u00a31.7bn) this year and will rise to $7.3bn by 2013.</p> <p>One measure of the improvement in biometric capabilities, according to Mark Lockie, editor of Biometric Technology Today and programme director of next week's conference, is the US series of face recognition vendor tests, which for the past 15 years have evaluated the latest systems. With a false acceptance level set at 0.001, initial tests in 1993 returned a false rejection rate of 79%. By 2002, the rejection rate had dropped to 20% and by 2006 was down to 1%.<br><strong><br>Socially acceptable </strong></p> <p>\"One issue that remains is the speed with which data can be downloaded from the computer chip [in UK passports],\" he says. \"Privacy is another matter. You can design biometric systems that enhance privacy. In the US, samples can be given for Aids tests along with fingerprints and collected by proving your identity without giving a name.\"</p> <p>The battle ahead for the industry may be more about gaining for social and political acceptance. The Conservatives say they will, if elected, ditch ID cards. Security agencies believe that to be effective, biometric records need to be matched across networks of international databases. Airport workers, on the front line of the new technology, remain to be convinced. </p> <p>The Guardian is the media partner of Biometrics 2008 <a href=\"http://www.biometrics.elsevier.com\">biometrics.elsevier.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Supermarkets reacted to the prolonged fall in the global oil market yesterday with a reduction in petrol prices, as airlines followed suit with British Airways and Virgin Atlantic confirming reductions in fuel surcharges. </p> <p>Asda and Morrisons dropped the price of unleaded to 99.9p a litre, taking the cost of a litre below \u00a31 for the first time since December last year.

However, the global oil price has fallen from its high of $147 (\u00a384) a barrel in the summer to less than $80 now. </p> <p>Edmund King, president of the AA, said motorists should expect lower petrol prices this winter. \"It does seem that, led by the supermarkets, we are getting a more realistic pump price, which will ease the pressure on inflation and the economy in general,\" he said. </p> <p>King added that a recent AA survey showed that three-quarters of motorists were spending or driving less due to high oil prices. \"These cuts will be a boost [for the economy],\" he said.</p> <p>Damien Cox, an analyst at the energy advisers John Hall Associates, predicted further oil price falls as the global economy deteriorated. \"With the economic situation looking the way it is, I don't think we have seen the bottom yet,\" he said.</p> <p>Petrol prices remain above last year's levels. In September last year, unleaded cost an average 95.2p a litre, with diesel averaging at 96.9p. </p> <p>Last week Tesco set off the downward momentum for petrol prices by shaving 3p off a litre, with the oil groups Total and BP making similar moves.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in only its second reduction in fuel surcharges since they were introduced four years ago, British Airways reduced the levy on long-haul flights for economy-class passengers but left charges for business-class customers unchanged. </p> <p>The surcharge on return flights lasting longer than nine hours will fall from \u00a3218 a ticket to \u00a3192 for anyone travelling in the back of the aircraft. The surcharge will drop from \u00a3156 for a return flight to \u00a3136 for long-haul economy-class journeys lasting less than nine hours. </p> <p>For premium economy passengers on long-haul flights under nine hours, the charge comes down from \u00a3176 return to \u00a3166; for return flights of more than nine hours, it is reduced from \u00a3229 to \u00a3222. Levies for short-haul flights and business-class passengers will stay the same, a BA spokesman said. Virgin Atlantic confirmed that it had reduced its economy-class surcharges by the same amount as BA. </p> <p>\"Other airlines have made a move on surcharges and BA needs to respond in order to keep its fares competitive,\" said an analyst at Blue Oar Securities.</p> <p>BA's September traffic has been severely affected by the credit crunch, with nine of its top 20 corporate customers coming from banking. The airline reported an 8.6% slump in business traffic last month. </p> <p>The traffic numbers reflect a downturn in BA's profitable corporate customer base and the consequences of passing on fuel price increases in fares. Fuel now accounts for more than a third of most airlines' costs. BA has raised fares by 7% so far this year, as well as raising surcharges. Low-cost airlines such as Ryanair have slashed fares to prop up demand.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/10/16/UNEMPLOYMENT_1610.pdf\">Graphic: The workforce in numbers</a> </p> <p>The number of people out of work rose at the fastest rate since the recession of the early 1990s in the three months to August, prompting fears that the jobless total will break through the 2 million level by Christmas.</p> <p>In the latest sign of the damage to the real economy caused by the 14-month credit crunch, the Office for National Statistics said the jobless total on the broad Labour Force Survey measure jumped by 164,000 in the three months to August from the previous three months - the biggest rise since June 1991 - to stand at just under 1.8 million. This is the highest level for nearly a decade. The jobless rate leapt to 5.75% from 5.2%, also the largest change since 1991. </p> <p>\"These numbers are truly horrendous and much worse than I had feared,\" said David Blanchflower, a labour market expert and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. He told the Guardian his earlier prediction that unemployment would rise to 2 million by Christmas now looked conservative. \"Unemployment will be above 2 million by Christmas.\" </p> <p>The figures referred to the period just before the latest and most damaging chapter of the global credit crisis, which experts say will push the jobless total higher still. </p> <p>Blanchflower said he was particularly worried at the 56,000 rise in the number of young unemployed people, the biggest increase since records began in 1992. \"These are school leavers who are unable to get a job or claim benefits, which is why the claimant count has not risen even faster than it has,\" he said.</p> <p>The number of people claiming jobless benefits rose by 31,800 last month to 939,000, the eighth monthly increase in a row. August's rise was revised higher to 35,700 - the biggest since December 1992. Job losses were concentrated in retail and hotel and catering sectors, as well as manufacturing and financial services.</p> <p>The figures also revealed that the hardest-hit area in the country was London, where the unemployment rate rose faster than anywhere else fastest as City workers began to lose their jobs. The capital, the north-east and north-west have the highest unemployment rates. </p> <p>Nigel Meager, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: \"No part of the country is spared. Much attention has focused on high-end jobs in the City. In an economic downturn, however, the real human cost is likely to hit lower skilled workers who find it harder to move into another job and have less of a financial cushion to see them through difficult times.\"</p> <p>Gordon Brown, speaking during an EU summit in Brussels, said: \"We will do whatever we can to ensure that people can stay in their jobs, we will do whatever we can so that people who lose their jobs can get new skills for the next job. We will do whatever we can to create opportunities.\"</p> <p>He promised to combine the fight against climate change and unemployment by broadening training to increase the number of people insulating lofts.</p> <p>\"So I just give you one example of how we can combine to meet the challenges of climate change and cut people's gas and electricity bills and create the opportunities for work and training for that work,\" he said.</p> <p>However, economists say that with the economy slowing, jobs will be lost faster than the government can create them.</p> <p>\"With the UK heading into recession, we expect unemployment to rise by a total of 1.5 million to around 3 million, or 9%, by the end of 2010,\" said Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats' work and pensions spokeswoman, Jenny Willott, said the government must switch its attention to unemployment now that the bank rescue package had been agreed.</p> <p>\"Real families across Britain are suffering, not just those working in the Square Mile. As the number of vacancies shrinks, it will be harder and harder to get people back into work. It will not simply be a case of retraining the unemployed if there are no jobs for them to return to,\" she said.</p> <p>Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the TUC, called on the Bank of England to cut interest further than the half point reduction it made last week. \"We are now seeing the effect of the credit crunch on the rest of the economy. I fear that the whole economy will soon feel the impact of the problems in the banking sector,\" he said.</p> <p>The ONS figures also showed that average earnings increased by a meagre 3.4% in August, the lowest figure for five years. </p> <p>\"Pay pressures remain very subdued,\" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. \"The labour market appears yet again not to be an inflationary threat to the economy which helps to justify the cut in interest rates last week.\"</p> <h2>In numbers</h2> <p>Unemployment is set to hit the City hard. Thousands of jobs have been slashed since the collapse of Lehman Brothers a month ago, with <strong>HSBC</strong> reducing its workforce by 1,100, <strong>UBS</strong> cutting 1,000 jobs and <strong>Bradford &amp; </strong><strong>Bingley</strong> getting rid of 300 members of staff.</p> <p>A report by the recruitment firm Morgan McKinley out yesterday said that the number of City workers looking for a job rose <strong>42%</strong> in the month to September, as firms make cutbacks. But it found new job <strong>vacancies fell 14%</strong> last month. </p> <p>Robert Thesiger at <strong>Morgan McKinley</strong> said: \"Recent events have affirmed that changes within the hiring market can be rapid and on a large scale. The influx of candidates coming on to the market last month, largely as a result of the collapse of several City institutions as well as general instability within the industry, is evidence of this.\"</p> <p>The <strong>Centre for Economic and Business Research</strong> predicted earlier this week that City jobs will decline by <strong>28,000</strong> <strong>in 2008</strong> and a further <strong>34,000 in 2009</strong>. The worst-hit sector will be corporate finance, which is likely to lose half its 15,000 employees over the next two years. Employment in derivatives is also set to <strong>fall by 46%</strong></p> <p>The report also predicted that legal and professional services, insurance, fund management, securities and equities sectors will all cut the head count by between 10% and 20%.</p> <p>\"The chances for a strong bounce-back in the City from 2010 onwards also appear to be slim,\" the report added. </p> <p>Richard Snook, a senior economist at the research body, said: \"The City will be hard-hit by the crisis; we expect it will be set back by a decade, with <strong>62,000 jobs lost</strong> over the next two years.\"<br><strong>Kathryn Hopkins</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/10/16/UNEMPLOYMENT_1610.pdf\">Graphic: The workforce in numbers</a></p>",
  "<h2>Emerging economies</h2> <p>South Africa, Brazil and India yesterday blamed western \"speculators\" yesterday for creating the crisis that endangered emerging economies and called for reform of the institutions of global governance to reflect their growing economic clout. At a summit in Delhi the countries said they were reeling from the credit crunch - which they blamed on the mistakes and greed of the wealthier world. \"We run the risk of being victims of a financial crisis generated by rich countries,\" said Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil's president. </p> <h2>European car sales</h2> <p>Car sales in Europe slumped by 8% last month making it the worst September for the industry for a decade. The manufacturers' association, Acea, blamed the decline on the credit crunch and warned that, unless governments step in, the industry would find it harder to invest in new, greener, technologies.</p> <h2>US retail sales</h2> <p>Retail sales in the US suffered their biggest fall in three years last month as consumers cut spending amid the financial meltdown. The US commerce department reported September's retail sales fell by 1.2% to $375.5bn (\u00a3216.5bn), nearly double the 0.7% decline expected by economists. The fall was the biggest since August 2005. The figures increased fears of a deep recession for the world's biggest economy, as consumer spending makes up two-thirds of total economic activity in the US. </p> <h2>Iceland</h2> <p>Iceland struggled to stave off economic ruin yesterday by slashing interest rates by 3.5% and pursuing talks with Russia over the possibility of a huge loan. Despite the cut, which brought the rate down from 15.5%, the central bank warned that the economic contraction would be \"very sharp\".</p>",
  "<h2>Conservatives win but fail to get overall majority</h2> <p>The Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, said yesterday he will reach out to all parties during the global financial crisis after his Conservative party won national elections, but failed to clinch an overall parliamentary majority. Harper had called Tuesday's elections early, becoming the first major world leader to face voters since the financial crisis began. But though the party increased its majority, it fell 12 seats short of the 155 needed to govern on its own and will be forced to rely on opposition support to pass legislation - as it has since a 2006 election victory. <br><strong>Associated Press in Ottawa</strong></p> <h2>Ministers sign accord for formal ties with Lebanon</h2> <p>Syria and Lebanon signed a document yesterday formalising diplomatic ties for the first time in their turbulent history. They pledged to strengthen relations \"based on mutual respect for each country's sovereignty and independence\", according to the document. Embassies will be set up in Beirut and Damascus before January, said Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, and his Lebanese counterpart, Fawzi Salloukh. The UN's special coordinator in Lebanon, Michael Williams, said it was a \"very important moment\" both for bilateral relations between the countries and for the region. <br><strong>Associated Press in Damascus</strong></p> <h2>Georgia-Russia meeting ends in acrimony</h2> <p>The first talks between Georgia and Russia since their war in August collapsed acrimoniously in Geneva last night, with each accusing the other of storming out. The Georgians said the Russians had pulled out of the meeting, brokered by the European Union and UN, to discuss the future of the Caucasus region. Moscow said Georgia scuppered the talks by refusing to meet officials from the breakaway republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. UN officials last night admitted the talks had been \"difficult\". Further negotiations will take place on November 18. <br><strong>Luke Harding in Moscow</strong></p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown has won plaudits over recent days for inspiring the turnaround in Hank Paulson's thinking that saw him progress from his \"cash for trash\" plan - derided by almost every economist, and many respected financiers - to a capital injection approach. The international pressure brought to bear on America may indeed have contributed to Paulson's volte-face. But Paulson figured he could reshape the UK approach in a way that was even better for America's banks than his original cash strategy. The fact that US taxpayers might get trashed in the process is simply part of the collateral damage that has been a hallmark of the Bush administration.</p> <p>Will this bail-out be enough? We don't know. The banks have engaged in such non-transparency that not even they really know the shape they are in. Every day there are more foreclosures - Paulson's plan did little about that. That means new holes in the balance sheets are being opened up as old holes get filled. There is a consensus that our economic downturn will get worse, much worse; and in every economic downturn, bankruptcies go up. So even if the banks had exercised prudent lending - and we know that many didn't - they would be faced with more losses. </p> <p>Britain showed at least that it still believed in some sort of system of accountability: heads of banks resigned. Nothing like this in the US. Britain understood that it made no sense to pour money into banks and have them pour out money to shareholders. The US only restricted the banks from increasing their dividends. The Treasury has sought to create a picture for the public of toughness, yet behind the scenes it is busy reassuring the banks not to worry, that it's all part of a show to keep voters and Congress placated. What is clear is that we will not have voting shares. Wall Street will have our money, but we will not have a full say in what should be done with it. A glance at the banks' recent track record of managing risk gives taxpayers every reason to be concerned. </p> <p>For all the show of toughness, the details suggest the US taxpayer got a raw deal. There is no comparison with the terms that Warren Buffett secured when he provided capital to Goldman Sachs. Buffett got a warrant - the right to buy in the future at a price that was even below the depressed price at the time. Paulson got for the US a warrant to buy in the future - at whatever the prevailing price at the time. The whole point of the warrant is so we participate in some of the upside, as the economy recovers from the crisis, and as the financial system starts to work. </p> <p>The Paulson plan responded to Congress's demand to have something like a warrant, but as a matter of form, not substance. Buffett got warrants equal to 100% of the value of what he put in. America's taxpayers got just 15%. Moreover, as George Soros has pointed out, in a few years time, when the economy is recovered, the banks shouldn't need to turn to the government for capital. The government should have issued convertible shares that gave the right to the government to automatically share in the gain in share price. </p> <p>Whether we were cheated or not, the banks now have our money. The next Congress will have two major tasks ahead. The first is to make sure that if the taxpayer loses on the deal, financial markets pay. The second is designing new regulations and a new regulatory system. Many in Wall Street have said that this should be postponed to a later date. We have a leaky boat, some argue, we need to fix that first. True, but we also know that there are really problems in the steering mechanism (and the captains who steer it) - if we don't fix those, we will crash on some other rocks before getting into port. Why should anyone have confidence in a banking system which has failed so badly, when nothing is being done to affect incentives? Many of those who urge postponing dealing with the reform of regulations really hope that, once the crisis is passed, business will return to usual, and nothing will be done. That's what happened after the last global financial crisis.</p> <p>There is a hope: the last financial crisis happened in distant regions of the world. Then it was the taxpayers in Thailand, Korea and Indonesia who had to pick up the tab for the financial markets' bad lending; this time it is taxpayers in the US and Europe. They are angry, and well they should be. Hopefully, our democracies are strong enough to overcome the power of money and special interests, and we will prove able to build the new regulatory system that the world needs if we are to have a prosperous and stable global economy in the 21st century.</p> <p>\u2022 Joseph E Stiglitz is university professor at Columbia University and recipient of the Nobel memorial prize in economic science in 2001.

  "<p>While the eyes of the western world have been fixed on the global financial crisis, the military campaign that launched the war on terror has been spinning out of control. Seven years after the US and Britain began their onslaught on Afghanistan to oust the Taliban and capture Osama bin Laden, the Taliban surround the capital, al-Qaida is flourishing in Pakistan and the war's sponsors have publicly fallen out about whether it has already been lost.</p> <p>As the US joint chiefs of staff chairman Admiral Mike Mullen concedes that the country is locked into a \"downward spiral\" of corruption, lawlessness and insurgency, Britain's ambassador in Kabul, Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, is quoted in a leaked briefing as declaring that \"American strategy is destined to fail\". The same diplomat who told us last year that British forces would be in Afghanistan for decades now believes foreign troops are \"part of the problem, not the solution\". </p> <p>The British commander Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith was last week even blunter. \"We're not going to win this war,\" he said, adding that if the Taliban were prepared to \"talk about a political settlement\", that was \"precisely the sort of progress that concludes insurgencies like this\". The double-barrelled duo were duly slapped down by US defence secretary Robert Gates for defeatism. But even Gates now publicly backs talks with the Taliban, which are in fact already taking place under Saudi sponsorship. </p> <p>This is the conflict western politicians and media continue to urge their reluctant populations to support as a war for civilisation. In reality, it is a war of barbarity, whose contempt for the value of Afghan life has fuelled the very resistance that western military and political leaders are now unable to contain.</p> <p>In this year alone, for every occupation soldier killed, at least three Afghan civilians have died at the hands of occupation forces. They include the 95 people, 60 of them children, killed by a US air assault in Azizabad in August; the 47 wedding guests dismembered by US bombardment in Nangarhar in July - US forces have a particular habit of attacking weddings; and the four women and children killed in a British rocket barrage six weeks ago in Sangin.</p> <p>By far the most comprehensive research into Afghan casualties over the past seven years has been carried out by Marc Herold, a US professor at the University of New Hampshire. In his latest findings, Herold estimates that the number of civilians directly killed by the US and other Nato forces since 2006, up to 3,273, is already higher than the toll exacted by the devastating three-month bombardment that ousted the Taliban regime in 2001. And over the past year civilian deaths at the hands of Nato forces have tripled, despite changes in rules of engagement.</p> <p>But most telling is the political and military calculation that underlies the Afghan civilian bloodletting. \"Close air support\" bomb attacks called in by ground forces - which rose from 176 in 2005 to 2,926 in 2007 and are now the US tactic of choice - are between four and 10 times as deadly for Afghan civilians as ground attacks, the figures show, and air strikes now account for 80% of those killed by the occupation forces. </p> <p>But while 242 US and Nato ground troops have died in the war with the Taliban this year, not a single pilot has been killed in action. The trade-off could not be clearer. With troops thin on the ground and the US military up to their necks in Iraq and elsewhere, US and Nato reliance on air attacks minimises their own casualties while guaranteeing that Afghan civilians will die in far larger numbers.</p> <p>It is that equation that makes a nonsense of US and British claims that their civilian victims are accidental \"collateral damage\", while the Taliban's use of roadside bombs, suicide attacks and classic guerrilla operations from civilian areas are a sign of their moral depravity. In real life, the escalating civilian death toll is not a mistake, but the result of a clear decision to put the lives of occupation troops before civilians; westerners before Afghans.</p> <p>Dependence on air power is also a reflection of US imperial overstretch and the reluctance of Nato states to put more boots on the ground. But however much the nominal Afghan president Hamid Karzai rails against Nato's recklessness with Afghan blood, the indiscriminate air war carries on regardless. Given that the US government spent 10 times more on every sea otter affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill than it does in \"condolence payments\" to Afghans for the killing of a family member, perhaps that shouldn't come as a surprise.</p> <p>But nor should it be that the occupation's cruelty is a recruiting sergeant for the Taliban. As Aga Lalai, who lost both grandparents, his wife, father, three brothers and four sisters in a US bombing in Helmand last summer, put it: \"So long as there is just one 40-day-old boy remaining alive, Afghans will fight against the people who do this to us.\"</p> <p>That doesn't just go for Afghanistan. Gordon Brown recently told British troops in Helmand: \"What you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of Britain.\" The opposite is the case. The occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq - and the atrocities carried out against their people - are a crucial motivation for those planning terror attacks in Britain, as case after case has shown. Now the US is launching attacks inside Pakistan, the risks of further terror and destabilisation can only grow.</p> <p>Senior Pakistani officials are convinced Nato is preparing to throw in the towel in Afghanistan. Both Bush and the two US presidential candidates are committed to an Iraq-style surge, though the number of troops being talked about cannot possibly make a decisive difference to the conflict - and in Barack Obama's case may be as much about providing political cover for his plans for Iraq. But the strategic importance of Afghanistan doesn't suggest any early US withdrawal: more likely an attempt to co-opt sections of the Taliban as part of a messy and protracted attempt to rearrange the occupation.</p> <p>It will fail. The US and its allies cannot pacify Afghanistan nor seal the border with the Taliban's Pakistani sanctuary. Eventually there is bound to be some sort of negotiated withdrawal as part of a wider regional and domestic settlement. But many thousands of Afghans - as well as occupying troops - look certain to be sacrificed in the meantime.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Canada's 2008 general election lacked the glamour of the contest taking place across its southern border. But it was more important and more interesting than its relative neglect - compared to the US election - suggests. Canada, after all, is a G7 nation with a well-developed welfare state, a major player in international peacekeeping and a vast nation without which global climate change cannot properly be addressed. It is in some ways a model for non-superpower important nations - like Britain - to follow. This was also the first election to take place in a developed nation since the credit crunch went ballistic. Any clues as to how voters react under such volatile conditions were worth watching for.</p> <p>Tuesday's early election was called because the Conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper, thought he could win the overall majority he failed to secure in January 2006. This week's second failure to do that - the Conservatives now have 143 seats in the 308-seat House of Commons - was therefore a blow to the party, though it was mitigated by the party's winning 16 new seats and by the heavy losses sustained by the opposition Liberals. The Liberals, who governed for much of the last 50 years, polled a record low share, 26%, and will now face internal upheavals and probably another leadership contest. Gains by the leftwing New Democrats, though more modest than once seemed possible, highlight the electoral squeeze on the Liberals. Canadians, like Germans, seem content with hung parliaments and weak governments these days. The appetite for change is small. </p> <p>Mr Harper failed to win outright mainly because the current financial upheavals caught him unawares - he called the election before the markets went into turmoil and he foolishly observed during the campaign that the stockmarket meltdown offered Canadians \"a lot of great buying opportunities\". But his party also failed to make inroads in Quebec, where the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois held its position, and his new-model Conservatives remain politically ill-defined. Mr Harper has a mandate to see Canada through recession, but things may get harder as the 2011 deadline for the withdrawal of Canada's troops from Afghanistan nears.</p> <p>Canada has a traditional banking system and little exposure to sub-prime loans - another reminder of its virtue. It has therefore been relatively insulated from the banking crisis. But there was no dash to the Conservatives when the markets went into spasm. In the absence of a strong alternative, Canadians have let Mr Harper off lightly, but this week's election confirms the tendency of voters to blame incumbents for economic upheaval - a lesson the US Republicans may be about to learn and which Gordon Brown would also be wise to ponder.</p>",
  "<p>The lights, crowds and attention-grabbing whizzes and bangs of the Tokyo Game Show, held last week in the Japanese capital, should scream migraine central to sensitive non-gamers. But to the faithful, it is the most exciting event in the calendar, offering a glimpse into the future of entertainment.</p> <p>Yet beneath the glitz and the glamour of this year's event, cracks were palpable, exposing the instability of the world's biggest gaming market.</p> <p>Japan has always been a prolific yet insular development space with a profound impact on the global industry. A walk through Akihabara, the capital's heaving technology district, demonstrates that while very few of the western heavy hitters are represented in any way, legions of unknown intellectual property line the streets. \"The number one thing I've come away with this year is the same thing I came away with 10 years ago: the massive gulf between eastern games and everything else,\" describes veteran British game designer Peter Molyneux.</p> <p><strong>Fable's feeble showing</strong></p> <p>Molyneux came to Tokyo to peddle his new roleplaying game, Fable II, a popular western title in a genre that dominates the eastern market. However, its platform, the Xbox 360, has the lowest distribution of any console in the country and is published by Microsoft, which has less than 1% of market share. \"We may think we are making games for the whole world, but it's not true,\" says Molyneux. \"The whole ethos, the whole makeup, the whole mechanics of the games - the way they're played is completely different; it's a shock that we still are unable to make a piece of entertainment that works over here.\"</p> <p>Historically, the reverse has been equally true. Both eastern and western analysts describe Japanese games as unsophisticated and mediocre compared with their non-Japanese counterparts, due in large part to the demands put upon developers by publishers at the mercy of their shareholders. The results are franchises based on manga and anime characters, which don't translate to the big-money audiences overseas. \"I'm intrigued and incredibly curious, but I recognise that many of the games I see on the show floor will never be translated into English, and so I have no idea what they're going to be like,\" explains Molyneux.</p> <p>\"There's a game down there called Monster Hunter,\" he continues, \"and the queues are incredible; there are people virtually passing out because they've been in the queues so long,\" he says. In fact, the Monster Hunter series has sold more than 4m units since it was released for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) last year. Yet it is virtually unknown elsewhere. Yoshiki Okamoto, the creator of Monster Hunter creator and president of developer Game Republic, had expected the game to be successful in western markets because it was set in Ireland, but the game never took off because it was \"too Japanese\", he says. It explains why the Japanese market has bottomed out, he told UK companies at the show.<br><strong><br>Backwards glance</strong></p> <p>Microsoft held a low-key press conference on the floor with a dearth of any revolutionary information. John Schappert, corporate vice-president of Live, Software and Services for the Interactive Entertainment Business, focused much of his presentation on Resident Evil 5 and Tekken 6 - surefire, successful franchises in Japan - before mooting Xbox Experience, an avatar-driven hub which \"aims to take our machine, initially released as a games machine, into an entertainment hub\". He also backhandedly announced Halo 3: Recon, an expansion pack for the monumentally successful Halo series - an IP which has sold 22.8m units in the west, but only 170,000 in Japan.</p> <p>Nintendo was a no-show, choosing to host a press conference a week before. But in its absence, third-party publishers and developers reflected the dominance of the platform in Japan; most stands were crammed with Wiis and Nintendo DSs.</p> <p>The Sony PSP was equally pervasive as developers scrambled to create software for a recently installed consumer base of 2.8m. Western palates were better catered for on the PlayStation stand, with new releases of music-led puzzler Loco Roco 2 and platformer Ratchet and Clank PSP.</p> <p>In all, the show felt like a backward glance into a forward market. There were few new games for European consumers, and no big announcements. However, the floods of consumers who flocked to the conference centre reiterated how central gaming is across all segments of this market. We'll have to wait until next year to see if the doom and gloom propositions of the business meetings will have an effect next year on the streets of Tokyo.</p>",
  "<p>There comes a point in the life of a TV funny man, generally sometime in his 40s, when he has a difficult choice to make. He can either carry on with what he's doing, trying to make people laugh, sometimes succeeding, but more often than not listening to the laughter dying away and the phone not ringing, followed by the downward spiral into alcoholism and depression. This is the usual course. </p> <p>I won't name names: you probably wouldn't even remember them.</p> <p>Or he can try to reinvent himself as something else, which is harder, and still usually involves bouts of mental illness. But there have been some successes. Michael Palin, who was funny in the 1970s, became an international traveller. There are a few more from the 80s. Ben Elton became a writer of novels and musicals. Baldrick is now an archaeologist. Stephen Fry is everything, including bipolar. Hugh Laurie is an American doctor. And Griff Rhys Jones is taking every presenting job going on the telly. He's done buildings, mountains, boats, anger. And now this: <strong>Greatest Cities of the World With Griff Rhys Jones</strong> (ITV1). </p> <p>We're in London, and Griff takes us on a 24-hour tour that goes beyond the normal open-top bus itinerary. A lot of his travelling is along the Y rather than the X axis, if I remember my maths O-level correctly. We climb up a crane and down a sewer, ascend a clocktower (quite a famous one), then abseil into a secret cold-war tunnel complex. It feels a bit like London by yo-yo. But it gives some nice new angles on a few familiar views. </p> <p>Griff is a cheery guide, perhaps a teeny bit too cheery. Every sentence he utters is spoken as if it's a line of comedy, with exaggerated emphasis often accompanied by a grimace or some other appropriate facial expression. You can take the man out of comedy, etc. It's a bit grating after a while, to be honest. Actually I never thought GRJ was that funny, even when it was his job, and perhaps he's better suited to this type of thing - just without the comedy speaking, please.</p> <p>My main gripe is that one whole section of the film has been made redundant by the news. We're on a City trading floor, Griff has a bash on the money markets himself, surrounded by whooping wide-boys. But of course, because of world events, these same people are now living in the sewers themselves, eating rats. I don't know much about the process of making television, but I simply don't believe that it wouldn't have been possible to re-edit the programme so as to make it not look totally stupid and, well, wrong. </p> <p>Ah, <strong>Paul Merton in India</strong> (Five). See? Another comedian who is at that time in life: trying to branch out, doing a bit of the travel thing. Paul Merton was funny, though, and still is, so this could be a bit premature. Maybe that's why he looks much less comfortable wandering round India in a funny white colonial suit than he does being a deadpan smartarse on Have I Got News for You.</p> <p>This show doesn't have much to do with India the new global economic superpower or India the great cultural centre. People will probably be cross about that. They'll say it's freakshow India - bodybuilding dwarfs, blind cricketers, eunuchs. I think it gets away with it. It doesn't matter where Paul Merton is, he'll always search out the ridiculous. And the joke is just as much on the confused traveller - the hot and bothered man in the white suit - as it is on the place he's visiting. This is quirky India, Paul Merton's India. And his Strictly Bhangra Dancing competition, with the Sikh policemen, is a joy. </p> <p>Not as joyous as prank-call show <strong>Fonejacker</strong> (E4) though, which, right now, has to be the funniest thing on the telly. I like the Iraqi man wanting to join the British Army. The recruitment officer is very helpful: he even thinks that Iraq may well be a Commonwealth country. </p> <p>\"What, because you occupy it now?\" says the Iraqi.</p> <p>\"Erm, we don't occupy it now ... Well, I suppose ... can't really get into all that with you, sir.\"</p> <p>It makes you squirm like an eel. But cringing is the new laughing - no, not new, it has been since Ali G, and Ricky Gervais. And this is so beautifully performed - by one man: Kayvan Novak. No need for Kayvan to go off travelling quite yet, then, he can stay put in Cricklewood. A lot of great things come out of Cricklewood.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown doesn't usually turn up early for EU summits. In December, when 26 leaders lined up to sign the Lisbon treaty in a medieval Portuguese monastery, the prime minister was a Johnny-come-lately.</p> <p>The Europeans were disgusted. His supporters were ashamed. The opposition crowed at another own goal.</p> <p>But yesterday in Brussels was a different story. The master of the markets arrived eight hours before kick-off for last night's summit, in the thick of a Euro-schmooze the likes of which the continent's leaders had never seen from a British prime minister.</p> <p>\"Look at him, on time, more engaged, more focused. He's very serious about this. Totally transformed,\" said one European diplomat with a long record of summit-watching.</p> <p>Breakfast with the head of the commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso (\"I want to pay tribute to Gordon Brown's role ... He has acted as an impetus\"), then on to a series of \"bilaterals\" with Scandinavian and central European prime ministers, to line them up behind his plot to save the world.</p> <p>A spot of lunch with the centre-left government leaders or wannabes of Europe. A post-prandial meet-the-media session. </p> <p>All this before going into the full summit, his ears ringing with of praise from the European press.</p> <p>So is Britain now going to join the euro, the man from Le Monde wanted to know. No, we're going to ask to join the pound sterling, cracked the fellow from Frankfurt.</p> <p>\"I did find an extra seat in the room,\" quipped Brown of his privileged role at a single currency summit in Paris on Sunday. But no panic. \"We have no plans to join [the euro] at this stage.\"</p> <p>It's been a stunning few days for Brown, from lame duck prime minister to global saviour in the space of a week. As the markets tumble, shares in Brown/Darling are going through the roof.</p> <p>In Brussels, it is a very long time since a British prime minister looked so good. He might be forgiven a whiff of triumphalism, but instead is trading in self-deprecation, perhaps assisted by the impression that he is the only head of government among last night's 27 who understands what he's talking about.</p> <p>Brown is in his comfort zone, transformed from Anglo-Saxon villain to European visionary. Everyone else is baffled and happy to let him exude authority with statements such as: \"Market participants should develop a robust clearing facility for OTC credit derivatives and fulfil other commitments to achieve greater certainty in OTC derivatives markets.\" The moment on Sunday when the rest of Europe lined up behind his master plan to stop the meltdown and unblock the markets he ascribed to the leadership of Barroso and France's Nicolas Sarkozy, the EU's current president.</p> <p>Brown's European moment occurred in the garden of the British ambassador's stunning residence in Paris after he had spent 20 minutes sweet talking the leaders and central bankers of Europe.</p> <p>The residence, purchased by the Duke of Wellington from Napoleon's favourite sister in 1814, is a sumptuous pile. Napoleon had just abdicated and been dispatched to Elba. The Brits moved in next door to the Elys\u00e9e Palace to lord it over Europe.</p> <p>Last night, for the first time in his premiership, Gordon Brown in Brussels bore a faint resemblance to Wellington in Paris.</p>",
  "<p>Guy Ritchie and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna\">Madonna</a> ended months of speculation yesterday by confirming that their eight-year marriage had come to an end. Leading lawyers predicted Ritchie would gain far less than half of the singer's estimated \u00a3300m fortune.</p> <p>News of the couple's divorce was greeted with little surprise yesterday. Rather like the implosion of the Icelandic financial system, it was something that those who keep an eye on such things had seen coming for some time. </p> <p>The only shock seemed to be that the marriage had lasted so long. When Madonna first stepped out with Ritchie in 1998 there was much discussion of how a relationship between pop's biggest control freak and a little-known British film director 10 years her junior could last. And even after the pair had their son, Rocco, and got married, there were perennial whispers that all was not well in any of their many houses.</p> <p>In June it was reported the singer had consulted Paul McCartney's divorce lawyer, Fiona Shackleton. But just weeks ago the couple made a public show of affection at the premiere of Ritchie's film, RocknRolla, in Leicester Square in London. </p> <p>Madonna's spokeswoman, Liz Rosenberg, said the couple expected to agree a divorce settlement without going through the courts. Ritchie, a mildly successful film director with far less earning power than his wife, is expected to walk out of the marriage with a fraction of her fortune.</p> <p>\"It is absolute nonsense to suggest that Guy Ritchie could get half of Madonna's wealth,\" said Andrew Newbury, a partner in family law at Pannone. \"Around 90% of couples never get as far as a court hearing, but if Madonna and Guy Ritchie do, the court will look at what each was worth when they married, and at the wealth they have built up during their marriage, which is what will be taken into account.\"</p> <p>Margaret Hatwood, a collaborative family lawyer from Thomas Eggar, added: \"One of the significant things here is that a lot of Madonna's wealth was built up before the marriage. I don't think Guy Ritchie will benefit greatly from that.\"</p> <p>Both lawyers agreed that the settlement won by Heather Mills McCartney earlier this year after her divorce from Paul McCartney was likely to be significant. The \u00a324.3m she was awarded was a tiny slice of his estimated \u00a3825m fortune.</p> <p>\"In some cases, one party can claim a sort of career prejudice,\" said Hatwood, citing the example of Julia McFarlane, who gave up a high-flying legal job to become a stay-at-home mother and was awarded alimony of \u00a3250,000 a year in 2006 for the rest of her life in recognition of her contribution to her husband's career. \"But arguably Guy Ritchie's career has been enhanced by his marriage to Madonna, rather like Heather Mills McCartney benefited from being married to a Beatle.\"</p> <p>Barrister Joanna Grandfield, from law firm Mills &amp; Reeve, added that if the couple had signed a prenuptial agreement it could count in any court case. \"A premarital agreement, properly constituted, is likely to be given much weight in the English courts and could have a great bearing as to how assets should be shared,\" she said.</p> <p>Ritchie, 40, and Madonna, 50, married almost eight years ago in Scotland. But yesterday the Sun reported that a recent escalation in rows had led to Madonna and Ritchie communicating via their personal assistants. It claimed Madonna had wanted to wait until the end of her Sticky and Sweet global tour before announcing the split. But the date has been brought forward with both parties wanting a divorce finalised before Christmas. </p> <p>Ritchie has broken off from filming in France to fly back to the UK to inform his parents of the split, the paper added. </p> <p>Madonna and Ritchie have two sons, Rocco, eight, and David Banda, a Malawian boy they adopted in 2006. Madonna also has a daughter, Lourdes, 12, fathered by personal trainer Carlos Leon.</p> <h2>Road to Ritchies</h2> <p><strong>Mar 1998</strong> Madonna meets British film director Guy Ritchie at a dinner party hosted by Sting </p> <p><strong>Aug 2000</strong> Madonna gives birth in the US to their first child, Rocco, after an emergency caesarean section.

  "<p>Yesterday a Labour MP referred to Gordon Brown, possibly with some irony, as Superman. A month ago the prime minister was a basket case, a shambling, pitiful figure who we assumed would soon be out on the streets begging enough coins for a cup of tea. MPs (and not a few of us journalists) are every bit as hysterical as those stockbrokers who believe one day that we are all doomed, and then decide next day that we are all saved and could buy that country house with the helipad before the price doubles.</p> <p>Brown is either a genius or a walking disaster, never anything in between. I think of him as the dynamic ditherer - someone who will do what has to be done with energy and even flair, but will wait to the last agonising moment before he does it. He wouldn't have been much use at the Somme. \"That's a shell coming over, captain!\" \"Yuss, I shall be considering several possible responses and will inform the company of my decision at an appropriate time.\" Yesterday he was in Brussels at an EU summit. Meanwhile, the FTSE-100 had sunk back to where it was when he performed his Superman act. His place at prime minister's questions was taken by the leader of the house, Harriet Harman. </p> <p>She didn't seem wholly in command of her brief. She was facing William Hague. You had the impression that the boss had bustled out, shouting over his shoulder, \"I've got a meeting - hold the fort, will you Ms Harman? Back in 20 minutes ...\"</p> <p>But he wasn't back in 20 minutes. There was no sign of him. Her tone began to sound just a trifle desperate. She flannelled. She didn't answer questions. She produced bland truisms as if they were valuable insights. She repeated herself. Mr Hague was actually milder than usual - the Tories still wish to appear statesmanlike - but he couldn't resist the temptation to whack her about. Biden versus Palin, it wasn't. There are no votes to be lost by being horrid to Hattie.</p> <p>\"We are not complacent about the situation in the economy, we have made no bones about the fact that our economy is facing hard times ... we will take every action we can ...\" You half expected her to add: \"I'm sure Mr Brown will be back in a moment. Would you like a cup of coffee?\"</p> <p>Mr Hague had turned up a blog she wrote in February. \"People know that there is global financial turbulence, but are not worried about their own prospects in 2008.\" Not the greatest prediction of the year. She replied, in effect, that she couldn't have known. The impact had been \"sudden\". She was the anti-Cassandra, bursting with good news that everyone ignored anyway. Was that Mr Brown coming back into the office now?</p> <p>But William Hague was just getting warmed up. \"Is it not time to acknowledge that the claim to have abolished boom and bust was one of the most foolish, one of the most hubristic and one of the most irresponsible claims ever made by a British prime minister?\"</p> <p>Poor Hattie looked as if she wished a giant predatory bird would flap down from the rafters and carry her off. \"I think that this is a serious moment for the economy, and it requires action from the government ...\" Mr Hague should not write off Britain. This is what governments always say when under pressure for their incompetence - anyone who criticises them is actually criticising Britain. </p> <p>Vince Cable for the Lib Dems was his usual blend of waspish humour, specialist knowledge and common sense. </p> <p>He hoped that people who can't pay their mortgages would be given government help \"promptly, efficiently and sympathetically, as the bankers were this week in their hour of need\". </p> <p>At last it was over. But still no sign of Mr Brown.</p>",
  "<p>Polly Toynbee is right to say the top 1% should be taxed to pay for this crisis (<a href=\"http://http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/economy-creditcrunch1\">The defibrillator worked - now for the intensive care</a>, <br>October 14). The problems were predicted, and no surprise to many. Before the Northern Rock debacle, Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson had written that the crash was coming. Four years before this, Anne Pettifor had published The Coming First World Debt Crisis and a year before that I'd written in these columns that big City bonuses were kick-starting another property boom and suggested capital gains and windfall taxes on banks to head it off. Will Hutton and others added their voices.</p> <p>The point is that if we all knew then so did many of those who were profiting from the speculative activity and the growth of unmanageable debt. That is why this time there are no queues of stockbrokers wanting to jump from high buildings. Such people can now hedge against everything, including their own failures. The head of Lehman Brothers departed with a fortune of half a billion dollars. The talk of curbing future remunerations misses the point that the past bonuses of \u00a320bn a year have been kept. An analysis of RBS by the BBC's Newsnight showed that just 2% of the accounts held half of the total money in the bank. When prices of land, property and stocks hit rock bottom, the very rich deploy their liquid financial assets, and the net effect of the crisis is to concentrate wealth even more at the top. Meanwhile, the losses, risks and personal costs of unemployment and instability are borne by the population as a whole.<br><strong>Greg Philo</strong> <br>Glasgow University Media Group </p> <p>What your interviewees ('It's a different world from ours, isn't it', October 14) don't realise, just as Lloyds TSB chief executive Eric Daniels appears to fail to understand when he spoke yesterday of unnecessary \"over-capitalisation\" by the government (Bosses pay the price as taxpayer moves in, October 14), is just how close it has come. No banks, no cashpoint. No credit card. No salary. No cash. No food on supermarket shelves.</p> <p>Far more worrying than the credit crunch is the fact that so many people don't understand why, after centuries of worrying about national debt, governments around the world have, in the space of a few short hours, gone into hock over their eyeballs to save \"banking\". It's simple. Without the banking bail-out, within a few months London would have more closely resembled Mogadishu.</p> <p>If anything comes out of this disaster, perhaps the most important benefit might be to throw a bucket of cold water into the faces of those ignorant of the risks inherent in how we have structured our society. There is no redundancy, there is no resilience. We can only live as we do thanks to an incredibly complex and delicate economic structure, built on the unacknowledged but diminishing subsidy of hydrocarbon fuels, within a biosphere we are blithely destroying.</p> <p>Unless we all wise up, either we or our children will spend our final days scrabbling for bread thrown from the back of an army lorry. Yes, you too Mr Daniels.<br><strong>Bill Robinson</strong><br>London </p> <p>President Bush said the US government will \"aggressively\" use a \"wide range of tools\" to resolve the financial crisis. Apparently, Bush's \"wide range of tools\" is not wide enough to contain a single free market policy. All the \"tools\" our government has aggressively used to date - bail-outs, takeovers, bans on short selling, manipulation of interest rates, creation of fiat money out of thin air, increased spending - have been yanked right out of the socialist and fascist toolkits. </p> <p>We will only get out of the mess created by our government if it cans all of those \"tools\" that got us where we are and starts freeing the market from its statist policies.<br><strong>David Holcberg</strong><br>Ayn Rand Center for Individual Rights, Washington DC </p> <p>The supplement on public pay sector pay (October 15) highlighted the need for an all-round fair solution to the current economic downturn.

  "<p>Chin up! The global economic meltdown is barely a week old and already we can see light at the end of the tunnel. Of course it may well turn out that the light is actually coming from the middle of the tunnel, perhaps from a burning freight car full of toxic debt, but don't worry: our world leaders will soon put that fire out, before moving on to the next flaming train wreck down the line, until finally we can all travel safely back to prosperity. Remember when we didn't have time for these extended metaphors?</p> <p>Apart from anything else, this is a great time to be British. Just a few weeks ago Britain was the only western economy tipped for recession. Now everybody has jumped on the bandwagon, and this nation finds itself a world leader in aggressive multibillion bank bailouts. Gordon Brown is even being hailed as an international hero thanks to his decisive and much-imitated intervention. It's such a huge boost to morale that in some way it doesn't matter whether it's working - which is good, because in some ways it isn't. </p> <p>Elsewhere, yet more evidence of the upbeat defiance one comes to associate with hard times: renowned bluegrass musician Eddie Adcock recently endured a brain operation to correct a tremor.

  "<p>Five months after countries pledged to give more than $12bn (\u00a36.9bn) to address the global food emergency, less than $1bn has been given, according to Oxfam.</p> <p>In a report to coincide with World Food Day today, the international aid charity berates rich countries for failing to respond speedily or adequately to soaring food and fuel prices.</p> <p>\"Rich countries are directing their attention to high fuel prices and turmoil in the financial sector, but the number of malnourished people in the world rose by 44 million in 2008,\" Oxfam said. \"Nearly one billion people are now going hungry. When you consider the speed of the world's response to the credit crisis, the delay in acting is shocking.\"</p> <p>In a separate report, Care International said that at least 6.4 million people in Ethiopia need emergency food aid and that Somalia is facing a food crisis \"unseen since the famine of the early 1990s\". </p> <p>\"Drought, conflict, and rising food prices have left more than 17 million people in the Horn of Africa sliding into a full-blown humanitarian crisis,\" said Jonathan Mitchell, Care's emergency director. \"These countries are heading into the peak hunger season when cereal prices are at their highest, and families have no stocks left from the previous harvest.\" </p> <p>The Oxfam report says that while staple food prices have come down since their peak in July, they remain stuck at levels far higher than the long term average. </p> <p>Barbara Stocking, director of Oxfam GB, said: \"It is shocking that the international community has failed to organise itself to respond adequately to this. The UN task force produced a good plan - the Comprehensive Framework for Action - but there is still not clear leadership to implement it.\" </p> <p>She added: \"Developing countries are being bombarded with different initiatives and asked to produce multiple plans for different donors. We need to see one coordinated international response, led by the UN, which channels funds urgently to those in need.\"</p> <p>The Oxfam report contrasts the global food crisis with the record profits being made by the world's largest agribusiness and seed companies. </p> <p>\"[US food company] Bunge saw its profits increase by $583m between April and July; Thailand's Charoen Pokphand Foods is forecasting a 237% increase in sales; Nestl\u00e9's global sales rose 8.9% from January to June, and Tesco has reported profits up 10% on last year,\" the report says. </p> <p>However, poor countries have also failed to come up with adequate answers to food price rises, says the report. Many countries responded by banning rice exports. </p> <p>But this, says the report, resulted in only limited curbs on inflation and has contributed to a shortage of supplies on the world market.</p>",
  "<p>I've tried everything I can think of to help the ailing economy. I've been to the shops a few times and I've regularly logged on to my building society's website just to reassure it that I still care. I have even looked in the sofa to see if there was any small change I could use to buy out an investment bank or two.</p> <p>Disappointingly, though, my \"think global, act local\" approach doesn't seem to have had much effect on Wall Street so far. My strenuous efforts have also been wasted on the people of my new home, San Francisco. It's a city where they've only just cottoned on to what the rest of the world has been watching for months. For many of the entrepreneurs I've been talking to in recent weeks, the stock market meltdown seemed to drop on them like an asteroid falling from space.</p> <p>Now the meteor has hit, some are trying to brave it out by suggesting that things haven't changed a bit. Only last week Mark Zuckerberg told a German newspaper that he didn't think Facebook would have a proper business model for three years. Google, it seems, is responsible for a generation of cargo cultists.</p> <p>For those dotcom entrepreneurs who are less brash than Zuckerberg, however, economic epiphanies are flowing thick and fast. Sequoia Capital's Mike Moritz, the king of Silicon Valley's venture capitalists, led the way by putting the willies up his portfolio companies (the advice, paraphrased, was: \"stop spending so much money and start making more\"). Suddenly everyone's talking about business models that involve making profit, not just selling to some cash-rich conglomerate.</p> <p>Shocking stuff, I know. These sudden revelations come years after the start of the latest round of bubblish behaviour; months after the banking system began wobbling; weeks after the credit crunch started looking awfully like a crisis.</p> <p>The truth is, this part of California has always been insulated from what goes on in the rest of the world. European explorers didn't even know this area of America existed until the 1700s; they'd never realised that the heavy fog banks that shroud the Golden Gate obscured the entrance to a land of plenty.</p> <p>The Bay Area not only boasts some of the most liberal politics in the US, but it's also one of the richest parts of America.</p> <p>This peculiar combination explains why it has taken so long to feel the pinch. The real victims of the mortgage crisis - poor families unwisely encouraged to pile on debt - are a long way removed from the slick super-rich technocrats and trust fund hipster kids who make up the spine of the community.</p> <p>But the dotcom world has actually been engaging in its own facsimile of the real world monetary crisis.</p> <p>The Web 2.0 boom has largely been funded with cheap money, hopeful investments and sour credit. Every player in the game has conspired to make this happen: the founders who tell everyone their idea is better than it really is, the buyers who believe it's so, and the investors who hope that nobody notices the difference until after they've sold. Sound familiar?</p> <p>You'd be forgiven for thinking that a city with such a tempestuous relationship with the San Andreas Fault would have an aversion to shaky foundations. Not so. In fact, it only helps reinforce the belief that regular turmoil is just a force of nature.</p> <p>Applying that kind of laid-back, West Coast philosophy to business requires a special kind of zen (the sort that's a lot easier if you're a Californian tech billionaire). Still, it's probably less stressful to take the long view. And that's why I'm taking a leaf out of the big boys' book and continuing my campaign to resurrect the financial system one small action at a time. After all, over here we know that whenever the ground shakes, things fall down. There's nothing you can do about it.

  "<p>Despite the current financial crisis turning attention away from sustainable development issues, the urgency of climate change makes the green agenda ever more pressing. As the EU council prepares to meet in Luxembourg later this week to discuss targets for greenhouse gas emissions cuts for 2020, it is a good time to take a closer look at the contribution of British communities to climate change. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Society/documents/2008/10/15/Carbonfootprintbarometer.pdf\">snapshot of local authorities' per capita carbon footprint</a> by <a href=\"http://www.localfutures.com/\">Local Futures</a> draws on the latest experimental data released by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI). SEI's carbon footprint indicator measures carbon dioxide emissions at the district level, associated with various aspects of residents' lifestyles: emissions caused by domestic energy use; transport; housing; consumption of food; and other goods bought and used by households, including emissions incorporated in imported goods. </p> <p>The data shows <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Society/documents/2008/10/15/Carbonmap.pdf\">great variation between local authorities</a>, with the southern part of the country placing a disproportionate burden on the environment. Out of the 25 districts with the largest per capita carbon footprint, 19 are situated in London and the south-east - with seven of them in Surrey.</p> <p>It is perhaps no surprise that districts whose residents have the largest carbon footprint in the country are the most affluent ones, highlighting unsustainable lifestyles and patterns of consumption in these areas. Districts scoring high on SEI's indicator are also clustered in the south-west (mainly in Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Dorset) and parts of Norfolk, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Essex in the east of England. </p> <p>The north-east, Wales and the West Midlands on the other hand, are the best performing regions, with most districts featuring in the bottom quartile. </p> <p>There are great disparities within London, as its boroughs populate the lists of the top and bottom 10 local authorities in terms of carbon footprint. The figure for London City - the local authority with the highest per capita footprint in the country \u2013 stands 50% higher than that of Newham, which appears to have the smallest score nationally. </p> <p>Cities generally tend to fare better, recording smaller figures in the housing and transport components of SEI's indicator than suburbs and more remote areas. This most likely reflects efficiencies deriving from urban density and from the developed transport systems found in cities. </p> <p>While somewhat unsurprising, the patterns in the per capita carbon footprint of local communities revealed by the data can serve to inform and galvanise action on the ground. Local authorities have a unique opportunity to make a real difference in tackling climate change through their renewed planning and economic development duties. </p> <p>Clearly, as the data shows, for some local authorities this opportunity also presents great challenges. At the same time, unless clear responsibilities and powers for climate change mitigation are devolved to the local level, this unique opportunity will be forgone. </p> <p>If the government is serious about its commitment to tackle climate change, it needs to provide local authorities with clear mechanisms and incentives to implement specific carbon reduction policies. These are related to delivering carbon neutral housing and sustainable transport schemes, enabling green entrepreneurship and promoting sustainable consumption at the individual and collective level - which would at the same time create thousands of \"green collar\" jobs, much needed in the current economic downturn. </p> <p>If such conditions are not in place, delivering the emissions reduction targets that the government has committed to will become an even more remote possibility than it appears to be today. </p> <p>Niki Charalampopoulou is a research assistant for the Local Futures group</p>",
  "<p>Rio Tinto sent a shock wave through the mining sector and triggered wider concerns about a global recession yesterday by warning of a major slowdown in China. </p> <p>The company said it was revising its capital spending plans and would miss its end-of-year target of making $10bn (\u00a35.65bn) worth of disposals.</p> <p>Shares in Rio Tinto fell more than 16% and other mining stocks lost as much as 26% after the company said it was cutting production at some of its aluminium smelters. The move came as the Aluminium Corporation of China (Chalco) decided to reduce its Chinese output in response to a 40% slide in local prices over the past couple of months.</p> <p>\"The Chinese economy is pausing for breath after spectacular GDP growth,\" said Tom Albanese, the Rio Tinto chief executive. \"Although not immune from the weakness in OECD countries, the China slowdown is largely caused by last year's tightening of Chinese monetary policy to address inflation.\"</p> <p>He said third-quarter economic data would underline the reduction in demand, which had been exaggerated by the halting of industrial projects during the Olympics. \"There will inevitably be an impact on Chinese exports from these factors.\"</p> <p>The views from the mining group reinforce fears that the Chinese economy - the engine of world industrial growth over the past five years - is beginning to stutter. Some critics say the rulers of the world's most populous nation have presided over a bubble economy that is just waiting to pop.</p> <p>But Rio Tinto believes China's long-term growth pattern can be sustained. It is a view shared by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, which argues that the west's financial crisis and world economic slowdown \"won't change the fundamentals of the Chinese economy\". </p> <p>Dick Evans, chief executive of the Rio Tinto Alcan business, said some growth projects were being put on hold in the aluminium sector and there would be production cutbacks at two or three of its high-cost smelters. \"If prices fall further then we might accelerate that,\" he said. </p> <p>The company had originally planned to boost aluminium output from 4m to 7m tonnes but at least some of this has been put on ice. Evans said he had heard that 1m tonnes of production had been shut down in China, about 7% of the nation's total.</p> <p>Chalco, the world's third-largest alumina producer, revealed it was reducing production at its Shandong plant by 1m tonnes on top of the 300,000 tonnes already halted. The closure would leave Shandong running at 200,000 tonnes of its 1.5m capacity. Weiqiao Aluminium, the second-largest alumina producer in China after Chalco, said it was operating at half of its 4m-tonne-a-year capacity and another rival, Lubei Group, said it was closing a 1m-tonne-a-year facility. </p> <p>Rio Tinto, which is facing a hostile $160bn takeover offer from BHP Billiton, said it had performed very well overall in the third quarter and was well placed for the future. But it admitted that its disposal programme was being made harder by the fall in commodity prices and uncertainties over the global economy.</p> <p>Charles Kernot, mining analyst at Evolution Securities, said the Rio Tinto announcements were important. \"We take the view, as with the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic, that the forthcoming recession will be severe and see a marked global contraction in commodity demand. The slowdown in significant capital expenditure projects and recognition that it cannot sell $10bn of non-core assets before the end of this year implies that Rio Tinto agrees with the politicians.\"</p> <p>BHP warned on Monday that China was slowing but said that it had no intention of cutting back any production or capital spending. </p> <p>Rio Tinto announced it had produced record levels of iron ore in the third quarter, up 17% year on year, and seen a 40% increase in Australian hard coking coal and a 13% growth in uranium output.</p>",
  "<p>Most people, if they bother to think about it at all, probably view the internet as an agent of profound change. In the 15 years since Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web, the life of almost everyone in the industrialised world has been touched by it. But just as many of us are getting to grips with its second stage, the mobile internet, very few are prepared - perhaps even aware - of the third and potentially most revolutionary phase of all: the internet of things.</p> <p>Sometime between now and 2010, the internet is poised to reach beyond virtual space and take root in the physical world. According to many futurist thinkers, almost every object you can see around you carries the possibility of being connected to the internet. This means that your domestic appliances, your clothes, the books on your shelves and your car in the driveway may one day soon be assigned a unique IP address, just as both computers and web pages are assigned them today, to enable them to talk to each other. </p> <p>'<strong>We can IP-enable it'</strong></p> <p>In the past month, a coalition of big technology companies, Cisco, Ericsson and Sun Microsystems among them, have formed the Ipso (IP for Smart Objects) Alliance with the aim of shaping a set of standards for the coming internet of things. \"We could incorporate internet protocol (IP) into nearly everything,\" enthuses Geoff Mulligan, chair of the Ipso Alliance. \"There's no reason why the internet shouldn't be in every single appliance.\"</p> <p>And he should know. Mulligan is one of the original architects of Arpanet, the proto-network built by the Pentagon that led directly to the wider internet we all use today. He believes that the connection of physical objects to the internet is the logical next step in its progression. \"The whole thing about IP is that it can run on almost any type of physical media,\" he explains. \"It doesn't care if it's Ethernet, power-line control or Bluetooth. Whatever it happens to be, we can IP-enable it.\"</p> <p>Now, the days of the internet as we know it are numbered, because the present IP address space - version 4 (usually called IPv4) - is going to hit its limit, even as early as 2010. It will be replaced by IPv6, which has addresses enough for about 3.4...1038 addresses, or 5x1028 for each of the 6.8 billion of us on earth. In other words, every human on the planet could have a personal network the size of the today's internet.</p> <p>One of the reasons that the internet needs so much address space (apart from the obvious reason that it doesn't want to run out again) is to create enough room for the internet of things. Already in Japan cows grazing in the fields of Hida Takayama have their own IPv6 addresses embedded on wireless RFID chips beneath their skin. Farmers can now track their livestock through the growth and distribution process.</p> <p>Back home, the first new IPv6 applications are likely to be in the control and sensor networks of expensive industrial machines, and then by business applications, probably in energy management. Mulligan cites the example of IP-enabled lights that can switch on an off as someone walks along a corridor, or rooms that are heated only when someone is present.</p> <p>After that, the internet of things is likely to extend into the home, with a range of IP-enabled appliances: smoke detectors, fridges, microwaves, water boilers - almost anything that is at present connected to the power grid is expected to get an IP address sometime in the future. \"Wouldn't it be cool if your smoke detector goes off and it told all of your gas appliances to turn off?\" suggests Mulligan. </p> <p>The trouble is that this vision of the smart home has been a staple of futurologist forecasts for decades and yet failed to become part of daily life. But what's different this time is the adoption of IP to standardise, and by extension popularise, a network of \"intelligent\" devices. Until recently the thinking has been that the adopters of such technology would be those keen to geekily control every aspect of their domesticity. But Tony Lucido, vice-president of marketing at Jennic, the Sheffield-based manufacturer of semiconductors and microchips (and a founding member of the Ipso Alliance) says utility companies - not individuals - could well drive the early adoption of the internet of things. \"Energy management is becoming a hot topic,\" he explains. \"Everyone is talking about conservation and using our energy more efficiently.\"</p> <p><strong>Smoothing the peaks</strong></p> <p>Lucido uses the example of how people are using wireless electricity meters, such as the Owl, that allow them to record their energy usage, in pence or Co2 per hour. \"The first phase is just displaying the energy usage within the home,\" he says. \"The next stage is remote energy management so that utility companies can find way to do load-shedding, [which helps] smooth off the peaks you get in energy usages. The way to do that it get access to people's appliances, let's say the washing machine, and at 5pm when energy usage is peaking. They will offer consumer discounts if they are allowed to control a few appliances in the home and shut them down for a few minutes during peak energy usage.\"</p> <p>That electricity usage should be the first major domestic application for the internet of things is something of a poetic beginning. For it was the late Mark Weiser, the former chief scientist at Xerox Parc, who first articulated the idea that ordinary household appliances could become embedded with information technology with his vision of ubiquitous computing. For Weiser, information technology was nothing more than a commodity, like electricity, that would become part of the fabric of everyday life.</p> <p>\"What a lot of people are doing these days is networking up their electricity meters in order to display their current energy consumption,\" says Usman Haque, a London-based architect and designer who believes the internet of things is already here. Last year, he launched a web service called <a href=\"http://pachube.com\">pachube.com</a>, which enables people to connect their devices and share real-time sensor data with each other. \"I compare it to YouTube, but rather than sharing videos you are sharing your sensor data,\" he says. \"The point really is to facilitate interaction between these devices. To open up the protocol, if you like, so the machines can communicate with each other.\" Since then everything from iceberg weather stations to river height sensing equipment to general building management systems have been connected to the network by a set of enthusiasts eager to experiment.</p> <p><strong>Coding the infrastructure</strong></p> <p>But, warns Haque, there could be disadvantages too. \"It depends whether we end up treating the internet of things as a system where we become enslaved to our devices, or whether we treat it as a truly open framework in which we are putting our devices and machines on to this system in order to facilitate our existence,\" he says. \"It could go either way.\"</p> <p>Few of the experts doubt that the internet of things will have a profound effect on the world, but what is apparent that there is no single authority designing it. Talk to any of the designers and coders building the infrastructure and each will tell you that they have private fears about a world where, as Wired magazine founder Kevin Kelly recently described it, \"the environment is the web\". Furthermore, the internet of things would have no on/off switch. It will arrive incrementally, one IP-enabled light switch at a time.</p> <p>In doing so, the internet of things promises to reshape our lives as fundamentally as the introduction of the railway, but with less public consent or even debate about its arrival. Before it does arrive, perhaps we could spare a moment to think what it might mean. As one day in the future you might even get assigned your own unique IP number. By then, of course, it will be too late to complain.</p>",
  "<p>When a recession last hit Australia, back in the early 1990s, then PM Paul Keating offered a dose of sang-froid: \"This is the recession we had to have.\" There is no room for such fatalism in today's Australia \u2013 it would be electoral death for any politician who dared voice it \u2013 but the threat of recession is now all too real.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Australian government announced a A$10.4bn (\u00a34bn) economic stimulus package. The intention: quite simply, to prompt a consumer spending spree and ensure the Australian economy doesn't slide into recession.</p> <p>For PM <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/24/australia.barbaramcmahon\">Kevin Rudd</a>, there will be no repeating Keating's mistakes. In a televised address to the nation, Rudd described the current situation as \"the economic equivalent of a national security crisis\".</p> <p>The sum involved in Rudd's spending rescue is small when compared to the \u00a3500bn put on the line by the British government in bailing out banks or the US$250bn the US government is now pumping into the pummelled American banking sector. Then again, Australia has until now remained immune to the contagion of a global credit crunch. While banks on both sides of the Atlantic were collapsing, or facing serious trouble, the Australian banking sector has escaped unscathed. A <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/10/09/business/OUKBS-UK-FINANCIAL-SOUNDEST-BANKS.php\">survey</a> by the World Economic Forum last week ranked the Australian banking system only behind Canada, Sweden and Luxembourg as the safest in the world. And while economic growth in much of the developed world was slowing, the Australian outlook remained strong (this year's Budget forecast was for 2.75% growth), plugged in as it is to the resource-hungry Chinese economy. All this seemed to confirm Australia's reputation as an economic strongman in the Asia-Pacific.</p> <p>So what, then, has changed? Australian anxiety has turned into panic. Last week, as part of the coordinated international wave of interest rate cuts, the Reserve Bank of Australia slashed rates by a full percent. The real worry is that ongoing financial difficulties may quickly spill over to the real economy in Australia. For all the apparent resilience of the Australian economy, there is a genuine vulnerability. Australian households are heavily laden with debt: average household debt stands at 182% of annual household income, and is one of the highest in the world. An economy that once lived off the sheep's back has in more recent times been living off the back of its credit cards, pumped up by the wealth that comes with inflated house prices. In other words, the Australian economy has been playing by the same rules of neoliberal western capitalism.</p> <p>Even so, the Australian situation is not as desperate as it could be, and certainly not as dire as it is here in Britain. Rudd has acted quickly and decisively, offering a government injection of cash into the economy at the first sign of trouble. While next year's budget is likely to head into deficit, government finances remain strong. There remains further scope for the government to stimulate consumer spending and investment, if required. The real test will be to stave off unemployment. A sudden rise in job losses is likely to mean an alarming rise in credit defaults, given the indebtedness of Australian households. Any sizeable deflation of the Australian housing bubble will have wide-ranging consequences.</p> <p>The imminent threat of recession presents the first grave challenge to Rudd's leadership, now almost a year since he took office. Last week, Rudd gave a speech in which he blamed the global financial crisis on slick-haired, white contrast-collared banking spivs \u2013 or as he put it, \"the children of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/14/wall-street-sequel\">Gordon Gekko</a>\". But if things do take a turn for the worse, it is unclear whether Rudd would front up to tell Australian voters that their own pathological streak of affluenza during the last decade \u2013 the debt-fueled consumption, the obsession with property \u2013 is also to blame. That would sound a lot like saying there is, yet again, a recession Australia has to have.</p>",

It's vital to innovation. Companies like Google, and Yahoo, and eBay, and Amazon, and Skype and so on, got their start without having to get permission from any ISP or any broadband provider to offer services. They simply acquired access to the internet, put their services up and then made them available to the general public.</p> </blockquote> <p>So far, so much the usual explanation of net neutrality. But what does Obama offer? </p> <blockquote> <p>We think that's the best way for the Internet to evolve and I'm pleased to say that in the upcoming presidential elections, the two candidates have rather different views of this particular matter. Senator Obama in particular sees things the way I do which is that the Net should remain open, fully accessible and providing access on a non-discriminatory basis to the people who want to offer new services on the network. </p> </blockquote> <p>We had an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/oct/02/interviews.internet\">exclusive interview with Cerf</a> at the start of October: he makes the case there again for the benefits of net neutrality.</p> <p>There are more scientists and technologists and their endorsements on the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/AVoteForScience\">AVoteForScience</a> channel on YouTube; safe to say that it's not seeing a huge amount of backing for John McCain and his creationist-backing running mate Sarah Palin - although McCain has been unusual among Republicans in accepting that climate change is real, important and urgent. That though has not been enough for many American scientists and technologists who want a break from the Bush years when science has been overruled.</p> <p>Obama did win a certain amount of opprobrium for his backing in June to the FISA bill, \"a sweeping intelligence surveillance law that has been heavily denounced by the liberal activists who have fueled the financial engines of his presidential campaign\" (<a href=\"http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/06/20/obama_supports_fisa_legislatio.html\">according to the Washington Post</a>).

The mood darkened after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/15/unemploymentdata-recession\">the latest unemployment figures showed another sharp rise</a>, as the impact of the financial crisis was felt across the UK economy. </p> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 733 points as it fell to 8,577.9, a drop of 7.8%. Stocks were dragged down by news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/15/useconomy-usa-retail\">US retail sales suffered their biggest drop</a> in more than three years, heightening fears of a deep recession in the world's largest economy. </p> <p>Rio Tinto spread alarm across the mining sector this morning when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2008/oct/15/mining-sportsdirectinternational\">it warned that demand from China is slowing down</a>. There are already fears that the global financial turmoil will wound the Chinese economy, hitting imports, exports, and demand for raw materials and energy.</p> <p>Last night the Dow closed down 0.8% at 9310 points after the Bush administration reluctantly followed Britain's lead by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/15/wall-street-bank-shares\">investing $250bn (\u00a3143bn)</a> in taking minority stakes in nine leading banks including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America and Citigroup. </p> <p>David Evans, market analyst at BetOnMarkets, said: \"While some investors might attribute the lower opening in London to profit taking, others are worried that the sagging corporate profits will overshadow the bail-out.\" </p> <p>Christian Gattiker at Bank Julius Baer said the volatility in the markets over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/glossary.black.swan\">last few days was a \"Black Swan\" event</a>. \"First we had relief when the bank guarantees were agreed, but now we have a haggling process by the banks,\" he said. \"There's not a lot to cheer about.\"</p> <p>In Japan, the Nikkei index which gained 14% yesterday in its biggest ever one-day jump, closed up another 1% today. Figures showing a 20% surge in imports while exports stagnated heightened fears of recession in Japan's export-dependent economy.</p> <p>Other Asian markets were more gloomy. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell over 5%, while South Korea's leading index lost 2%. The Australian stock exchange was down 1%. The Shanghai Composite and the Taiex in Taiwan both fell almost 1%.</p> <p>In India, shares slid 3.5% as finance minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said interbank lending still remained constrained, and the government and the central bank had agreed measures to address the problem.</p> <p>Evans noted that oil has tracked swings in stockmarkets this month as the credit crisis deepened. \"Oil traders will have a full plate tomorrow as they await the release of the inventory supplies data. There is a strong possibility that oil will touch the $75 per barrel level before stabilising,\" he said. </p> <p>Oil prices fell to $78 a barrel this morning. Light, sweet crude for November delivery fell 72 cents to $77.91 a barrel then settled at $78.52.</p> <p>\"People are worried that the world economy is heading for recession,\" said Gerard Rigby, an energy analyst at Fuel First Consulting in Sydney. \"The bail-out may save the banks, but companies are still laying off workers and demand is going to suffer.\"</p>",
  "<p>As far as reputations go, Gordon Brown is not the only one who has managed to <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-britain-brownoct14,0,7127771.story\">look good</a> in the face of the global economic meltdown. Spain and its socialist government have looked confident and decisive in response to the crisis.</p> <p>Unflappable <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/speaker/0,2879,en_21571361_37578380_37888355_1_1_1_1,00.html\">Pedro Solbes</a>, the finance minister, resisted the kneejerk unilateralism of Ireland's blanket guarantee of savers' deposits, arguing early on that Europe needed to adopt a coordinated response to the world's credit crunch. However, when initial attempts to thrash out a European consensus failed, Spain was quick to unveil a national strategy.</p> <p>Next Monday, a special parliamentary session will be held to approve the government's measures: to offer bank guarantees for new debt of up to \u20ac100bn this year (and the government has already indicated it is likely to make available around the same amount next year) and to set up a fund of up to \u20ac50bn to buy assets from banks in order to keep credit flowing to the economy.</p> <p>Spain's main opposition party, the conservative Partido Popular (PP), is broadly in favour of the measures, which is unsurprising as they are similar to those being introduced by other European countries and followed a meeting of Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero,the prime minister, with some of the country's largest bankers, including those from Santander and BBVA.</p> <p>But it's high time to focus on the nitty-gritty of the plan. \"The conditions which the economy ministry is going to establish so that banks can benefit from this guarantee are still unknown,\" points out Wednesday's business daily <a href=\"http://www.negocios.com/negocios/\">La Gaceta de los Negocios</a>.</p> <p>The Spanish taxpayer has a right to know what kind of assets the government will buy with the emergency fund, how the process will be run, their interests protected and whether the funding will reach \"the real economy\" \u2013 including families and small businesses hit by tighter lending and the increase in the <a href=\"http://www.euribor.org/\">Euribor</a>.</p> <p>The government has said the fund will be used only to buy \"high quality assets at their real value\" and that eventually it will stimulate the market, so that it does not cost the taxpayer a cent. Critics have viewed these assurances with scepticism. \"Why are we going to give banks this large sum of money without asking what they are going to do with it, as Solbes proposed we do on Friday?\", wrote Santiago Gonz\u00e1lez in right-of-centre El Mundo. \"Let's apply the same lack of trust which they apply to us when they gave us loans.\"</p> <p>The largest Spanish trade union, the CCOO, made its own proposition to ensure the country's borrowers reap some of the benefits of the bank guarantees \u2013 it proposes banks which get public aid be obliged to cut their interest rates on mortgages (on average 5.477% in October) to the ECB's lending interest rate, which is currently 3.75%.</p> <p>Whether accepted or not, the proposal is a reminder that beyond the liquidity squeeze facing banks, the Spanish economy faces a home-grown crisis of its own. While Spanish banks have boasted they are not saddled with fancy derivatives of dubious value, many face rising defaults on mortgages and consumer loans issued at the height of Spain's decade-long building boom and have to compete for business in a less dynamic economy.</p> <p>History will ultimately rate this government on its ability to implement some painful and unpopular economic restructuring, to drive up productivity and create wealth and jobs beyond the empty houses which litter Spain's coasts and many of its cities.</p>",

  "<p>Government guarantees on individuals' savings could be raised from \u00a350,000 pounds, Gordon Brown said today as he unveiled plans for an upcoming summit of world leaders to tackle the global finance crisis.</p> <p>The UK savings guarantee has just been raised from \u00a335,000 to \u00a350,000, while the European Commission is proposing a new EU-wide \u20ac100,000 guarantee on deposits, with the sum being repaid within three days.</p> <p>The Financial Services Authority has been considering whether to raise the limit again. At a gathering of European leaders in Brussels, Brown said this was now a possibility.</p> <p>\"As far as the deposit guarantees is concerned, we moved to \u00a350,000 over the last few days. We said at the time we were prepared to look at any other proposals. Obviously we will see what comes up in the discussions. But the FSA is at the moment looking at the proposals.\"</p> <p>Earlier, Brown said the planned global summit would set in motion the most far-reaching reforms to world financial institutions in 60 years.</p> <p>He arrived in Brussels today to promote his plan to reform the Bretton Woods financial framework of 1944, which led to the establishment of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>In a meeting with Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European commission president, at 9.30am - more than five hours before the formal start of the summit - Brown distributed a new paper which called for:</p> <p>\u2022 a new early-warning system for the world economy to ensure that problems are anticipated earlier,</p> <p>\u2022 a new framework to ensure crises are dealt with better as they arise,</p> <p>\u2022 better surveillance of what is happening in the world economy so that people are aware on one continent of what is happening on other continents, and</p> <p>\u2022 a new cross-border college of supervisors to monitor the world's top 30 countries that trade across borders.</p> <p>Brown said: \"We believe that the trust that has been lost in the financial system will be best built for the future by people agreeing to these proposals. I want to see a timetable for agreeing these proposals over the next few weeks and months.\"</p> <p>The prime minister, who first called for reform of Bretton Woods in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis, said he hoped world leaders would now accept his proposals. \"We need to reform the international system in a more profound way so that it meets the challenges of the future. The institutions like the IMF and the World Bank were created for the circumstances of 60 years ago. We now have global markets. Instead of simply having national supervisors we need a global way of supervising our international system.\"</p> <p>The prime minister hopes that the EU's 27 leaders, who will discuss the financial crisis in their session before dinner tonight, will agree to the proposals in the coming weeks. That would allow the four EU members of the G8 - Britain, France, Germany and Italy - to present a united front at the world summit, which will include the G8 members plus major economies such as Brazil and India. Brown hopes the meeting will take place in November or December.</p> <p>Brown said: \"I believe that a forum to decide big changes in the international economy can be held in the next few months. I said I wouldn't put a specific date on it because that is what has to be agreed with all countries.</p> <p>\"There have been discussions with all the major countries about the desirability of this and when it would be most appropriate. There is now general agreement that there should be an international leaders' meeting. There is agreement that the agenda should include far-reaching reform of the international financial system.\"</p> <p>The prime minister received a warm welcome in Brussels today in the wake of the decision of Hank Paulson, the US treasury secretary, and EU countries to implement bank rescue plans along the lines of Britain's plan.</p> <p>But eyebrows were raised today when Brown circulated his new paper. Under EU convention it is for the country holding the rotating presidency - currently France - to do that.</p>",
  "<p>The most galling thing about Peter Mandelson's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/13/mandelson-lords\">return to British politics</a> earlier this month was how Gordon Brown summarised his stint in Brussels. \"Everyone has said right round the world that he has done a brilliant job\", the prime minister proclaimed, a line repeated by several BBC correspondents as if it was an undisputed truth.</p> <p>A ceremony taking place in <a href=\"http://www.nationnews.com/editorial/305025285326278.php\">Barbados</a> this week indicates that Mandelson has little to show for his four years as the EU's trade commissioner. Governments in the Caribbean are signing an <a href=\"http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2008/february/tradoc_137971.pdf\">economic partnership agreement (pdf)</a> with the union, one of the few free trade deals that this \"brilliant\" negotiator actually clinched. </p> <p>The term agreement is a misnomer in this case. For the most part, its provisions were not the product of a frank dialogue on how the Caribbean could put commerce at the service of its people. Rather, they were drawn up by Brussels officials and presented in a take-it-or-leave-it manner. </p> <p>Enormous pressure was put on representatives of Caribbean nations to cross what they considered red lines. This was especially so with the inclusion of a \"<a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/theWTO_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm\">most favoured nation</a>\" clause, under which any trade concession that these islands offer to major economies such as Brazil, India or China would automatically have to be offered to the EU as well.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.crnm.org/brussels_rep.htm\">Junior Lodge</a>, the chief negotiator for the Caribbean, had stated he was \"violently opposed\" to the EU's demands for this clause \u2013 which others have described as an affront to the national sovereignty of the countries concerned \u2013 as he felt it was being driven by an aggressive mercantilist agenda. Yet because of Mandelson's bullying, his region eventually had to capitulate.</p> <p>The bullying lacked even a modicum of subtlety. The Caribbean was told that if it did not accept an EPA by the end of last year, higher tariffs would be imposed on its exports to Europe. Shortly before he left Brussels, Mandelson reiterated that threat to Guyana, which initialled an agreement in December last but \u2013 following the election of a new government \u2013 has been <a href=\"http://www.bilaterals.org/article.php3?id_article=10922\">reluctant</a> to sign it. Imposing increased trade taxes on Guyana would deprive it of some \u20ac70m per year, a huge sum for a small economy where the national income per capita is only about \u20ac7,000.</p> <p>The EPA also boasts chapters on competition, investment and public procurement. Known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_issues\">Singapore issues</a>, these topics proved so contentious during the Doha round of world trade talks that developing countries insisted that they be taken off the agenda. Unable to get its way in a quasi-global forum, the EU is now reintroducing these measures \u2013 aimed at giving multinationals unimpeded access to wherever they wish to do business \u2013 through the backdoor.</p> <p>Just as troubling, the Caribbean is being pushed to adopt European standards of intellectual property. This is not a question of preventing fake Gucci handbags being sold in Jamaica or the Bahamas. Instead, the stringent rules relating to pharmaceutical patents in the accord are likely to mean that people with life-threatening diseases will no longer be able to afford cheap generic versions of medicines. And, according to one of the most probing <a href=\"http://www.ciel.org/Publications/Oxfam_TechnicalBrief_5May08.pdf\">assessments (pdf)</a> yet conducted on the EPA, public libraries and schools could be prevented from allowing students to have access to materials that are under copyright.</p> <p>None of this affects the Caribbean in isolation. EU officials have made clear that they want this agreement to serve as a model for similarly comprehensive ones they are hoping to reach with over 60 countries in Africa and the Pacific. Diplomats from these countries do not share Brown's view that Mandelson did a \"brilliant job\"; some have described the EPA talks as the most painful experience of their careers.</p> <p>A new report by <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org/assets/pdf/BREAD%20Report%202.pdf\">ActionAid (pdf)</a> warns that foisting trade liberalisation on Africa will exacerbate the crisis over soaring food prices that drew some attention from western journalists before we all became fixated with Wall Street's woes. Requiring Africa to open up to European agricultural produce will further increase its dependency on imported food, rather than stimulating the development of the continent's own farming sector.</p> <p><a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/1466&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en\">Catherine Ashton</a>, Mandelson's replacement as trade commissioner, steps into an atmosphere of acrimony and distrust between the EU and some of the world's poorest countries as a direct result of her predecessor's sledgehammer tactics. It would be comforting to end on an upbeat note by quoting that inane pop song he was seen bopping to over a decade ago: things can only get better. But it could take a long time to repair the damage he has done.</p>",
  "<p>The new energy and climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, insisted today that there must be no retreat from the government's climate change agenda in the face of the coming recession, as he prepared to accept proposals from Lord Turner's climate change committee tomorrow to increase Britain's statutory target to cut carbon emissions from 60% to 80% by 2050. </p> <p>In his first interview since he was appointed secretary of state at the new Department for Energy and Climate Change, he claims many of the new jobs of the future will be green jobs, adding that the cost to taxpayers of failing to fix the environment will only be higher if it is not tackled now. <br> \"The central argument of the Stern report is that the costs of not acting are worse than the costs of acting, and the longer you leave it, the worse it gets in terms of the costs. So I don't think there is an option not to act,\" Miliband told the Guardian.</p> <p>He is due to respond tomorrow in the Commons to a recommendation from the government's climate change committee, chaired by Lord (Adair) Turner, that the government raise its target to cut carbon emissions to 80% by 2050 from 1990 levels. </p> <p>Without being specific about his response tomorrow, Miliband makes it clear he shares Turner's assumption that the science has changed since the original 60% reduction target was set in 2000. </p> <p>\"It would not be true to say that after the events of the past three weeks that climate change is at the front of millions of people's minds. But politics is about leadership and that means saying this is an incredibly important issue not just for us but for our children,\" he said.<br> Much of that leadership must be shown by the EU. \"By the end of the year the EU must reach agreement on the 2020 package on renewables and energy efficiency. That is how we can send a signal that we can get an agreement on a worldwide UN deal in Copenhagen at the end of next year. </p> <p>\"If the EU sticks to its guns and says we will hold to our climate change commitments that will have an impact on other countries . If it looks like we are retreating, it will also have an impact.\"</p> <p>The minister insisted Britain was not retreating from the EU position that if a world deal was struck next year, the required reduction in carbon emissions from the EU would automatically rise from 20% to 30%. </p> <p>\"We are absolutely committed to 30%. I want to be very clear about this. I am also very clear that if Britain is to play an important role in international negotiations, then we have to lead by example.\"<br> He said he was hugely encouraged by the attitude to the issue of the two US presidential candidates. </p> <p>He also urged the green movement to build a relationship with him based on good faith. \"If there is an assumption of bad faith we are not going to get anywhere, so we have to show, through the totality of our actions, that we are broadly committed to this agenda. The NGOs are not going to agree with us about everything, nor are the energy companies, but there should be an assumption of good faith.\" <br> He added that he wanted a bigger popular green movement. \"Politicians cannot do this alone.\"</p> <p>But Miliband will disappoint some NGOs by saying that aviation should not be included in renewables targets, arguing that \"there is not a credible way of showing in relation to aviation it can be driven by renewables\". </p> <p>Airlines such as Virgin are pledging to use 5% renewable fuel by 2015. <br> Looking at the wider state of the debate on climate change, Miliband says \"the argument about the science has been broadly won, but I do not think the argument on what individuals can do to make a difference has yet been won.\" </p> <p>He said he thought government had to do more to make it easier for people to go green in their daily lives, and admitted that he was not a paragon of virtue in his personal life, even if he was trying to use his car less. </p> <p>He said he was taken by the \"thought experiment\" on personal trading allowances of the foreign secretary, his brother David. </p> <p>\"This is my thought experiment on it,\" the climate change secretary said. \"What is very smart about this idea is transparency, the idea that we get to know what our personal carbon emissions are. I do not say that is the end of the story - that is the very important first step along the road to personal carbon allowances. As to the long-term practicalities and how it would work, I don't know. I'll need to commission some work on it.\"</p> <p>On the imminent and fraught decision over whether to sanction the construction of a new coal-fired power station at Kingsnorth, Kent, Miliband says he is not going to announce a decision after 10 days in the job. </p> <p>\"I have to look at this in a balanced way,\" he said, but he added that the \"only long-term prospect for sustainable energy is around clean fuels. If we are going to meet our targets for 2050, we will have to do it with clean energy.\"</p> <p>He said he was delighted that the European parliament last week voted in favour of stumping up the \u00a37.8bn necessary for 12 carbon capture and storage demonstration projects. </p> <p>\"CCS has got huge potential. The debate is about whether and when that potential is going to be realised,\" he said.</p> <p>He seemed opposed to the idea of allowing the polluting plant to go ahead, as some have suggested, on the condition that it would be closed prematurely if it did not meet maximum carbon emissions criteria by a fixed date, such as 2020. </p> <p>On nuclear he described himself as a \"sober-minded supporter of nuclear power\" but admitted he \"was not raised in exactly a pro-nuclear family\".</p> <p>\"The government used to have a moratorium on new nuclear power stations; that has been lifted, but there is not going to be any subsidy from government, either in construction or clean-up costs. On safety, it is important to remember that 15% of our energy comes from nuclear now and we have got a good safety record.\" </p> <p>Due to meet energy companies for the first time this afternoon, he said: \"I do not think it is fair that people on pre-payment meters [suffer] from their energy prices. Ofgem is right to say there has got to be action by the energy companies to stop this happening. I am expecting action to be taken swiftly, and if there is not, the government can legislate.\"</p> <p>He said he was also looking at the structure of tariffs so that people might no longer have to pay the highest price for the first tranche of gas and electricity they used. </p> <p>He said he was strongly expecting the energy companies not to pass on the cost of the energy efficiency, or \"lag the loft\" programme announced by Gordon Brown in September.<br> But he suggested he was not planning to intervene, pointing out that \"we are not operating in a price-regulated market\". </p> <p>His new department, housed off Whitehall, is a potentially fraught marriage of the former energy department of Business, Energy and Regulatory Reform, and the climate change wing of Defra. </p> <p>Altogether he is likely to have around 1,000 civil servants working under him, and one of his first tasks will be to create some synergy between the pro-nuclear, pro-business civil servants from Berr and the greener types from Defra. </p> <p>\"To pretend there are not dilemmas and trade-offs in government would be dishonest, but I have got to integrate this department into one coherent whole. If all this was simply bringing civil servants from two departments into one building that would not make sense. You can already see people who used to be on the energy side of Berr now understand and emphasise the climate change approach perhaps more than they would have done. Equally on the climate change [side] they are understanding energy.\"</p> <p>He rejected suggestions that transport or housing should be included in his new empire, saying that the department was big enough to wield influence within Whitehall. <br> \"The concept of the new department is absolutely right. It is a reflection of the fact that the issues of energy and climate change are inextricably linked. Production and energy account for two thirds of carbon emissions. </p> <p>\"You need an energy policy that is sustainable and a climate change policy that is fair. Therefore it makes sense to bring them together. I am hugely excited at the possibilities.\"</p>",

  "<p>An army of loft insulators and draught-proofers is to be released on to the streets of Britain as Gordon Brown combines his fight against climate change with the need to provide jobs in an economic downturn.</p> <p>In an echo of the New Deal, launched by the US president Franklin Roosevelt during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the prime minister said that a new employment scheme would train thousands of loft insulators.</p> <p>Speaking in Brussels at the EU summit, Brown expressed his concern about the sharp rise in unemployment announced today. But he said he had a plan.</p> <p>\"We are expanding in a very radical way our insulation and draught-proofing central-heating provision for the elderly and other people in our country. We are training large numbers of additional people to do that work in insulation. That will be one of the employment programmes that will grow. </p> <p>\"So I just give you one example of how we can combine to meet the challenges of climate change and cut people's gas and electricity bills and create the opportunities for work and training for that work.\"</p> <p>Brown expressed his concern about people losing their jobs. \"Every person who loses their job and the redundancies that are taking place in our country concerns me,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We have over the last 10 years created 3 million jobs extra. Therefore we want to maintain employment levels as high as possible.</p> <p>\"We will do whatever we can to ensure that people can stay in their jobs, we will do whatever we can so that people who lose their jobs can get new skills for the next job. We will do whatever we can to create opportunities.\"</p> <p>Chris Grayling, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said that Brown's remarks demonstrated that he had \"nothing substantial to offer\".<br> \"For all the hype surrounding Gordon Brown in the past few days, these comments show just how out of touch he is with what is going on in the real economy. He promised that he had ended boom and bust - but today's unemployment figures show what an absurd claim that was. </p> <p>\"Now as people are paying the price for that failure, he has nothing substantial to offer them. If training people to lag roofs is the best suggestion he can make, then it doesn't say much for the challenges we face as a nation.\"</p> <p>Tony McNulty, the employment minister, responded: \"It shows how out of touch Grayling is that while Gordon Brown is in Brussels leading European efforts to tackle the global economic crisis, his first thought is to trivialise an initiative that is aiming to get people into work and has helped 3 million people cut their fuel bills. </p> <p>\"This really is a shallow comment from a shallow man and I fail to see how this fits in with the constructive opposition which his leader has promised.\"</p>",
  "<p>Only half of the development projects carried out in the world's most insecure countries by the UK government are achieving their development aims, according to a report published today by the National Audit Office (NAO).</p> <p>The report by the government's independent spending watchdog shows evidence of poor project design and performance in insecure environments such as Iraq and Afghanistan and concludes that average project performance is \"worsening\". It also reported that the Department for International Development (DfID) sometimes fails to consider whether its work in war zones might actually exacerbate conflict.</p> <p>DfID, which spends over \u00a31bn in overseas aid to developing countries, had \"limited experience\" of operating in insecure countries and \"insufficient evidence on how best to adapt its approach to counter the risks posed by insecurity\", the report said. </p> <p>It was also damning of DfID's management structures. \"Guidance for staff needs to be adapted to reflect the challenges of working in an insecure environment ... it is less clear how far their assessments inform the design and management of programmes.\" The NAO showed DfID spends on average \u00a3250,000 employing a member of DfID staff in Afghanistan. Despite this funding, the NAO showed that DfID experiences a \"high staff turnover, limited experience and staffing gaps\" in insecure environments.</p> <p>Launching the report, Tim Burr, the auditor general of the NAO, said that DfID had \"insufficient experience\" of operating in the most insecure environments and needed to improve. He said: \"Guidance for staff needs to be adapted to reflect the challenges of working in an insecure environment. DfID teams in insecure countries assess the extent and nature of conflict, but it is less clear how far these assessments inform the design and management of programmes. In order to improve the effectiveness of aid operations, DfID needs to apply the lessons from practical experience more quickly.\"</p> <p>The NAO said it believed the reason for this was because of the difficult environments in which it was working. A spokesperson said: \"Higher risks run in insecure environments have led to a lower project success rates. DfID could be better and faster at learning lessons.\"</p> <p>Examples of poor project design cited in the report included the case of UK government-funded money put into the Afghan government's counter-narcotics programme between 2005 and 2008, \"but the government lacked the capacity to design and implement component projects\".</p> <p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, what the NAO called \"poor monitoring\" by DfID due to insecurity meant that insecticide-treated bed-nets had not been available free to pregnant women at a health clinic; as a result malaria increased.</p> <p>The report also showed evidence of fraud in a quarter of DfID-funded programmes, but a spokesman for the NAO said that this was more likely to be \"people walking off with bags of cement rather than bags of money\".</p> <p>A \u00a320m project in Iraq suffered from serious corruption when local officials massively overbilled the amount of work days for a contract. DfID was unable to adequately monitor the situation because of the poor security situation.</p> <p>Andrew Mitchell, the shadow international development secretary said: \"It is clear that DfID needs to learn new skills and up its game.\"</p>",
  "<p>An ultra-sensitive form of the silicon used in most solar panels may soon help to harness the near limitless power of the sun. Thanks to an extremely rough surface, \"black silicon\" can absorb more light and can also trap a wider range of frequencies, including infra-red rays, that normally pass straight through standard silicon.</p> <p>Eric Mazur, a physicist at Harvard University, discovered black silicon by accident in his laboratory in 1998 when one of his research team blasted normal silicon with a very short laser pulse. Almost a decade later, the company created to commercialise his work, SiOnyx, has announced the production of the first commercial-grade wafers.</p> <p>While producing electricity from the sun's rays has enormous potential, the industry has been hampered by the high cost of silicon wafers. Research teams around the world have been hunting for ways to bring down costs by improving the efficiency of solar cells. </p> <p>Mazur said that photovoltaic (PV) cells using black silicon would significantly increase the efficiency of modern panels, the majority of which only convert around 8% of the energy falling on them into electricity. The very best convert around 20%. He said that a black silicon wafer could approach the theoretical limit of converting around 30%-40% of the energy falling on it into electricity.</p> <p>Daniel Davies, chief technology officer at the PV manufacturer Solarcentury, said there were two potential areas for development in solar cells: getting more out of conventional crystals of silicon and the high-volume manufacture of thin film PV. </p> <p>\"SiOnyx sounds like an interesting method of increasing the efficiency of conventional crystalline PV,\" he said. \"If this can be easily integrated into the cell processing that already exists then the potential to increase the global manufacturing capacity with a relatively low level of intervention is very exciting.\"</p> <p>Making textured surfaces on silicon is already possible, notes Keith Barnham, a physicist at Imperial College London who works on PV cells. \"What's important is if this [technique] helps the light absorption so that you can get away with thinner cells. There has been a silicon shortage and the price is not coming down, so the less you use of it the better. With good light-trapping, which is what these can do, you can hope to get higher efficiency in a much thinner cell.\"</p> <p>The rough surface of black silicon allows it absorb light from many different angles, producing an electrical response to light that is 500 times greater than normal silicon. Another advantage is that black silicon can absorb infra-red radiation, which makes up around a quarter of the energy coming from the sun and which normally passes through silicon panels. As well as PV cells, it could improve the performance of any device that uses silicon to detect low levels of light, such as night vision goggles, medical imaging equipment, surveillance satellites and even digital cameras.</p> <p>\"We've been completely stealth, there hasn't been anything published about the company since its founding. We wanted to make sure we could scale the technology into a commercial foundry,\" said Steve Saylor, chief executive of SiOnyx. \"The recent success in doing that is why we've started to introduce the company.\"</p> <p>More than $11m (\u00a36.3m) of venture capital has been invested so far in the Massachusetts-based SiOnyx. Mazur said the most recent work has shown that additional cost of making black, as opposed to standard, silicon wafers was marginal. \"We were in a standard silicon foundry and there was no modification required to it.\"</p> <p>Greenpeace's chief scientist Doug Parr expressed a note of caution: \"The challenge [for solar] is cheap mass production and a widespread application of the technology. Many apparent breakthroughs fall at this hurdle, but we hope that black silicon can get to the next stage.\"</p> <p>Mazur said his discovery of black silicon was serendipitous: \"We were doing research on the chemical reactions on metal surfaces and, on a hunch, I said let's look at semiconductors, without a clear plan.\" </p> <p>One of his research team fired short pulses of laser light at a piece of silicon wafer in the presence of the gas sulphur hexafluoride. When Mazur examined the resulting black silicon under a high-powered microscope, he found the surface was covered in a forest of short spikes.</p>",
  "<p>The boss of Mexico's public sector teachers' union has caused outrage in a country where 40% live below the poverty line by splashing out on 59 Humvees for her top officials.</p> <p>Elba Esther Gordillo - known simply as \"la maestra\", or \"the teacher\" - handed out the first dozen of the controversial vehicles at a meeting of her 1.6 million-strong union at the weekend.</p> <p>\"This is a strategic car and if I could I would be handing them over to you amour-plated, and that's the truth,\" she told the lucky recipients, who reportedly broke into applause. \"This is not an attempt to manipulate or buy loyalties. Nothing could be further from my intentions,\" she said.</p> <p>But the Mexican public has reacted badly to images of union bosses getting into the orange and silver Hummers, worth some 500,000 pesos (\u00a323,000), bombarding radio programmes and newspaper websites with angry comments. Many have expressed their outrage at such largesse at a time when the global financial crisis is causing widespread concern. </p> <p>The recipients initially justified the gifts by citing their need to reach isolated rural schools along unpaved roads and to ensure their personal security in a country in which 3,500 people have been killed this year in increasingly violent gang warfare.</p> <p>When this failed to diffuse the mounting scandal, Gordillo changed tack and announced this week that the Hummers had always been intended as raffle prizes to raise money for deprived schools.</p> <p>It was not clear whether this would be enough to bury the indignation.</p> <p>In recent years Hummers have become an increasingly common sight in Mexico, where they are popular with bourgeois ladies in well-to-do parts of the capital, and are now one of the vehicles of choice for gangsters. </p> <p>More Hummers are bought in Mexico each year than anywhere else in the world outside the US.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iceland\">Iceland</a> rushed to stave off economic ruin today by slashing interest rates by 3.5% and pursuing talks with Russia over the possibility of a multibillion euro loan. </p> <p>But despite the cut, which brought the policy rate down from a record high of 15.5%, the central bank issued a bleak forecast, predicting the collapse of Iceland's banks would be \"extremely burdensome\" and the economic contraction \"very sharp\". </p> <p>In a statement warning of numerous job losses and reduced market demand, the bank noted: \"The Icelandic economy has been subjected to unprecedented turbulence in the past few weeks. The banking system has not been able to withstand the trials it has faced as a result of difficult market conditions, global deterioration of confidence in economic affairs, and domestic risk appetite. </p> <p>\"A variety of jobs have disappeared virtually in the blink of an eye, demand has declined precipitously and, by all measures, expectations are at a low ebb.\"</p> <p>As the team of Icelandic officials sat down with their Russian counterparts for a second day of bail-out negotiations in Moscow, the country drew on swap facilities with Denmark and Norway, tapping them each for \u20ac200m (\u00a3155m) to kickstart its currency markets. </p> <p>The country has already accepted a \u00a3100m loan from the UK government to help it repay depositors in Landsbanki, one of the three Icelandic banks nationalised last week after the country's banking system fell apart.</p> <p>Iceland is also due to present a plan to the International Monetary Fund over the next few days and is widely expected to seek funds further afield.</p> <p>The country has endured years of high interest rates as its central bank struggled to control inflation. A collapse of the Icelandic krona exacerbated the situation as the island nation is heavily dependent on imported goods.</p> <p>Asgeir Jonsson, an analyst at Kaupthing, which was nationalised along with Landsbanki and Glitnir last week, welcomed the interest rate cut.</p> <p>\"It will help companies that will now have to be financed by Icelandic banks,\" he said. \"Going forward, we will not see any serious inflation in 2009 given that 20% of the CPI [consumer price index] is the housing market. Labour unions have said they would be willing to accept a two-year wage freeze.</p> <p>\"The main thing is that they have to stabilise the currency and get the payments system going again.\" </p> <p>The Icelandic prime minister, Geir Haarde, insisted he still had \"full confidence\" in the head of the central bank, David Oddsson, even though the governor has been criticised by some for his handling of the crisis.</p> <p>\"This is not the time to assess blame for what happened; this is the time to find solutions,\" said Haarde.</p> <p>While Iceland tried to shore up its economy, the British government announced it had sent emergency teams into three of the 116 local councils that have a total of \u00a3858m deposited in Icelandic banks. </p> <p>Thirteen local authorities said they may face short-term problems because of the blocked deposits, but ministers stressed there was \"no reason to think that wages will not be paid or that services could be at risk\". </p> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/15/localgovernment-localgovernment\">talks this afternoon</a>, the government and the Local Government Association released a joint statement saying they were working \"to get the best and most rapid resolution of the situation relating to Icelandic banks and the \u00a3858m\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, speculation mounted over the future of the Icelandic retail investor Baugur, whose UK interests include Hamley's, House of Fraser, Karen Millen and Oasis. </p> <p>Although the British retail magnate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/retail-iceland\">Sir Philip Green</a> had been regarded as the favourite to snap up Baugur's \u00a31bn debt \u2014 and possibly its entire operation \u2014 reports suggestt other potential buyers have emerged, among them the equity groups TPG, Permira and Alchemy.

  "<p>Hundreds of thousands of people who love books all in the same place - it must be fun, right? Not exactly. Frankfurt Book Fair, which kicked off today, might be buzzy, busy, exhilarating, exhausting \u2013 but most people aren't here to muck about. The biggest event of the year for the publishing industry, this is where the deals are made, from foreign rights in an obscure British textbook to the mega-bucks deal for the yet-to-emerge \"book of the fair\" (which at the London Book Fair in 2007, incidentally, was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/oct/14/booker-prize-adiga-white-tiger\">Aravind Adiga's Booker-winning The White Tiger</a>).</p> <p>Although there are lots of authors here (Orhan Pamuk, Karin Slaughter and Gunter Grass, to name a few), this is really a trade event. The German public will descend en masse come the weekend to snaffle new titles from their favourite authors, but for the rest of the week, it's business first.</p> <p>And this year, like the rest of the world, the question the books business is asking itself is if books are going to be affected by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/15/creditcrunch-globaleconomy\">the worldwide financial crisis</a>.</p> <p>Looking at the numbers, the answer is yes, it already has been. There are fewer exhibitors here than there were last year (7,373 compared to 7,448), and a recent survey of 90 German publishers shows that <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.de/14875/20081014/\">business was down 3%</a> in Germany over the first nine months of the year.</p> <p>But publishers here are resolutely optimistic about the fate of books in a recession - one agent said that \"books are good in the good times, and great in the bad times\". <a href=\"http://faz-community.faz.net/blogs/charkin/archive/2008/10/14/day-one-actually-my-171st-frankfurt-book-fair-day.aspx\">In the words of Richard Charkin</a>, former Macmillan chief, now Bloomsbury executive director, \"banks may crash, derivatives flounder, hedge funds wither, dotcoms rise and fall but somehow or other writers, publishers, booksellers, literary agents, publishing consultants and old bookish friends always manage to congregate for the autumnal bunfight known by the single word, Frankfurt\".</p> <p>Other hopeful types have been pointing out that publishing has done OK in previous recessions. Nigel Newton, co-founder of Bloomsbury, is adopting a wait-and-see attitude, but for the moment he is revelling in stellar sales for his Warren Buffett biography, The Snowball, which he thinks wouldn't have happened without the credit crunch.</p> <p>Michael Bhaskar at Pan Macmillan is more cautious: \"There has been much talk of how publishing might be 'recession-proof' sales are up due to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/oct/02/pressandpublishing.christmas\">Super Thursday</a> \u2026 To my mind such talk sounds a bit like the commercial equivalent of waving a big red flag at a big angry bull,\" he writes at <a href=\"http://thedigitalist.net/?p=265\">The Digitalist</a>. But like the others, he concludes that books are going to be alright, come what may \u2013 although he thinks sales of expensive e-readers are likely to be affected.<br><a href=\"http://fifthestate.co.uk/2008/10/a-prescription-for-thrift-what-would-yours-be/#more-461\"><br>Louise Tucker at publishing blog Fifth Estate</a> writes hopefully that \"compared to a cinema ticket in London, a \u00a37.99 paperback is still a bargain, since, if loved, it provides several hours, or even years in the rereading, of pleasure\", while Philip Jones at trade mag the Bookseller is also looking on the bright side. \"The business does seem almost embarrassingly healthy,\" he blogs, pointing to recent big-money deals such as <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/blogs/68900-still-a-good-time-for-books.html\">Hodder's seven-figure splurge on Simon Pegg</a>. \"[This] suggest that money remains on the table - at least for the big books.\"</p> <p>I'm almost convinced (although splashing out \u00a31m-plus on Pegg <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/15/unemploymentdata-recession\">seems a little distasteful</a> when people are losing their jobs \u2013 is he really worth it?).

  "<p>The leaders of South Africa, Brazil and India today blamed Western \"speculators\" for creating the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">financial crisis</a> that endangered the development of the world's emerging economies - and called for reform of the institutions of global governance to reflect their growing economic clout.<br> At a summit in the Indian capital, the three countries said they were reeling from the credit crunch \u2013 which they blamed on the mistakes and greed of the wealthier world. \"We run the risk of being victims of a financial crisis generated by rich countries. This is unjust,\" said Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.  \"It is inadmissible that we'll pay for the irresponsibility of speculators that transformed the world into a gigantic casino. At the same time they gave us lessons on how we should govern our countries.\" Countries like Brazil and India, part of the so-called BRIC group of elite emerging markets, have been campaigning for more influence on global policies and for a seat at the high table of international decision-making. They say the \"southern\" nations need adequate representation in the citadels of power such as the United Nations security council and the Group of Eight industrialised countries.</p> <p>India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, said: \"More than ever before a renewed effort to reform the institutions of international governance, our voice on how to manage this crisis in a way that does not jeopardise our development priorities, needs to be heard in international councils.\"</p> <p>All three nations have been flexing their muscles at the world trade talks \u2013 which were sunk two months ago after India and China refused to accept American demands over fears for food security. Both Brazil and South Africa are key mineral and agricultural exporters.</p> <p>The three nations had agreed in 2003 to hold regular meetings on how to promote the needs of emerging economies. The International Monetary Fund revealed forecasts last week that showed global growth would be kept afloat by the emerging economies. India will still see its economy manage 7.9% growth next year, down from 9.3%.</p> <p>However, this aggregate figure conceals a painful slowdown. Yesterday Jet Airways, India's biggest private carrier, announced it was \"letting go\" 1,900 staff and the government said it was looking to inject more cash into the markets.</p> <p>All three nations have seen strongly performing stock and currency markets slide as foreign investors, who fuelled emerging market booms, flee \u2013 pulling out money to meet liquidity needs in their home markets. </p> <p>In the last three months Brazil's currency the real has fallen by more than 30% against the dollar, the South African rand is down by 18% and the Indian rupee weakened by almost 12%.</p> <p>Even worse has been the collapse in equity valuations in the three economies. Brazil's stockmarket has lost more than 40% in the last three months \u2013 while both India and South Africa have seen shares in the main indices drop by a quarter.</p> <p>South Africa's president, Kgalema Motlanthe, said answers were still required about self-regulatory mechanisms \"that we were told would obviate what has become an unmitigated disaster\".</p> <p>\"As a developing world we must accept that one-sided solutions ascribed to us by the developed world must be approached with a great deal of caution.

  "<p>In March 2007, European leaders embarked on the most far-reaching and ambitious EU policy undertaken since the launch of the euro. They not only agreed on a 20% target for overall emissions reduction by 2020, but \u2013 crucially \u2013 binding targets for 20% of <em>all</em> energy to be sourced from renewables, and for 10% of transport fuels to come from biofuels. </p> <p>Now, with full-blown recession in Europe a serious possibility, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/15/climatechange-carbonemissions\">politicians are getting cold feet</a>. It's not hard to see why.</p> <p>The scale of the package is breathtaking. In Britain, it would mean around 40% of electricity being generated from renewable sources (up from under 5% today), within a decade. Building five new wind turbines every single working day from now until 2020 would get us just over halfway to meeting this target.

This is equivalent to \u00a3600 per family of four per year, paid for in higher bills, lower wages and more costly goods and services. It means up to \u00a3200 extra on the annual domestic energy bill for British families; which could push one million more people in fuel poverty. The plan will squeeze society's most vulnerable the hardest \u2013 just when they can least afford it.</p> <p>If this was the only or most efficient way to combat catastrophic global warming, it might (at a push) be possible to justify. But the real tragedy is that this is not the case: the plan is, quite simply, a wasteful and inefficient approach to cutting carbon.</p> <p>In a highly influential report, <a href=\"http://www.berc.berkeley.edu/flyers/McKinseyQ.pdf\">consultants McKinsey (pdf)</a> suggested that the cost of bringing global emissions down to safe levels could come in at less than \u20ac40 per tonne, predominantly achieved through energy efficiency and better management of forests and agriculture. A <a href=\"http://www.bdi-online.de/en/Dokumente/Report_CostsandPotentialsofGHGabatementGermany_BDI_McKinsey.pdf\">more recent report (pdf)</a> on climate change policy in Germany (Europe's largest emitter) found that by 2020: \"A reduction of 31% is possible with measures that cost less than \u20ac20 per tonne of CO2 or are part of the already planned change in energy mix.\"</p> <p>However, under the EU plan, the technology-specific targets for renewables and biofuels mean that investment is unlikely to be directed towards the most cost-effective methods of removing CO2 from the atmosphere. These distortions will mean that the per-unit cost of carbon reduction of the EU package as a whole will be unnecessarily high, at \u20ac80 to \u20ac105 per tonne of CO2.</p> <p>It is not hard to see why the EU package is so inefficient. Biofuels <a href=\"http://www.openeurope.org.uk/research/eereport.pdf\">grown in Europe (pdf)</a> cost \u20ac160 to \u20ac470 for every tonne of CO2 avoided. To offset this, we could import cheaper agro-fuels from the tropics, which may or may not have been grown on land cleared from natural carbon sinks like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/feb/08/scienceofclimatechange.biofuels\">rainforest or peatlands</a>; or perhaps <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/05/colombia.energy\">grabbed by force</a> (there would be no way to be sure). Renewable electricity is better, but is also a poor performer: the <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/Environment/climatechange/uk/energy/renewablefuel/pdf/ukbiomassstrategy-0507.pdf\">UK government admits (pdf)</a> that its system for renewable electricity subsidy costs around \u20ac180 per tonne of CO2 saved. </p> <p>It is important to note that some renewables may be cost effective \u2013 for instance, limited amounts of onshore wind energy and large-scale hydro. These can and should be a part of our arsenal of measures for fighting climate change. However, it is certain that because of its vast scale, the EU target cannot be met solely through these cheaper renewable technologies. To come anywhere close, there will be no choice but to rely on more expensive options like solar, tidal power, and offshore wind. </p> <p>We should also bear in mind that any form of wind power will suffer progressively <a href=\"http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file21118.pdf\">declining productivity (pdf)</a> as the best sites are used up first. The costs of extra fossil fuel backup and supply/demand balancing for this highly intermittent power source will also begin to ski-slope up as more turbines are built. </p> <p>These arguments are not intended to write off EU-level action on climate change. It is justifiable for transnational bodies like the EU to set targets for absolute carbon emissions reductions, which is ultimately what matters. But it is wrong for the commission to insist on prescribing the <em>means</em> by which EU member states achieve this objective \u2013 especially when the policies they are pushing are probably the wrong ones. </p> <p>And if, against all expectations, huge volumes of renewable energy are in fact the best solution, simple, tightly enforced absolute emission reduction targets, backed by a solid carbon price, would direct money towards these projects as appropriate.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of a shrinking economy and rising unemployment, it is absolutely essential to approach climate change policy rationally, and reduce carbon emissions as efficiently and cheaply as possible. </p> <p>National ministers will discuss <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/09/energy.climatechange\">the EU proposals</a> this week. It should now be <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hcE2rGwQxeJcGBDQ-nPs8BGCqwyg\">more obvious than ever</a> that the elderly and the fuel-poor literally cannot afford the indulgence of irrational and wasteful policies that will be locked in under this reckless plan.</p>",
  "<p>A petrol price war ensued today as two major supermarkets announced they were cutting the price of unleaded to less than \u00a31 a litre. </p> <p>Asda cut prices at its pumps by 5p a litre to 99.9p, and cut the cost of diesel to 110.9p from 116.9p. </p> <p>Morrisons also announced it was dropping its prices. Motorists will now pay 99.9p for unleaded and 111.9p for diesel on the supermarket's forecourts. </p> <p>Petrol has not been under \u00a31 a litre in the UK since December last year, and prices have since soared as high as 120p a litre for unleaded and 130p a litre for diesel. </p> <p>Jennifer England, a spokeswoman for Asda, said the cut would be \"a welcome boost\" for consumers.</p> <p>\"Unlike some of our competitors, our price is constant throughout the country and does not vary from area to area. This reduction will come as a relief to road users,\" she said.</p> <p>Morrisons said the reductions would apply across its 287 UK forecourts, and that it was the sixth time it had cut petrol prices since July.</p> <p>The retailer's chief executive, Marc Bolland, said: \"This is strong support for the millions of motorists that are served at our forecourts. We're absolutely committed to delivering real value for all of our customers - whether they're shopping in our stores or filling up at our forecourts.\"</p> <p>The moves came after oil prices today slid to their lowest level for nearly 14 months amid concerns the world economy is heading for a major slowdown.</p> <p>Today's fall in oil prices was reflected on the stockmarket, with shares in BP sliding nearly 4%. Royal Dutch Shell fell by the same amount.</p> <p>The price of oil on world markets has fallen from a high of around $147 a barrel earlier this year to around $80 last week. Prime minister Gordon Brown said he wanted this price cut to be passed on to consumers \"as quickly as possible\".</p> <h2>Respite</h2> <p>RAC motoring strategist Adrian Tink said: \"Finally we have a bit of respite for Britain's hard-pressed motorists. For the past year they have been paying over \u00a31 a litre for petrol - a figure that went up to \u00a31.19 in July.</p> <p>\"This has hit Britain's motorists hard in a tough economic climate, with the average motorist spending over \u00a31,300 a year to fill their tank.</p> <p>\"At least that figure should start to come down now and motorists will see a significant difference in their wallet when they next visit the forecourt.\"</p> <p>Tink urged all retailers to follow with their own price cuts. </p> <p>Last week, Tesco began a new round of price cuts after cutting prices by 3p a litre at its 430 forecourts. Total followed suit, while BP announced it had reduced pump prices at its 300 company-owned stores by an average of 3p a litre and some sites by 5p a litre.</p> <p>Petrol prices remain above last year's levels, however. In September last year unleaded cost an average 95.2p a litre, with diesel averaging 96.9p. </p> <p>Damien Cox, senior analyst at energy adviser John Hall Associates, predicted further oil price falls as the global economy deteriorates. </p> <p>\"With the economic situation looking the way it is, I don't think we have seen the bottom yet. There's still a little bit to come out of this over the next few months,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>A summit of world leaders - possibly to include the new president-elect of the United States - will take place by the end of the year, Gordon Brown announced this afternoon as he unveiled new British proposals to avoid another collapse of the financial system.</p> <p>Speaking at the European summit in Brussels, the prime minister declared that the summit would set in motion the most far-reaching reforms to world financial institutions in 60 years.</p> <p>Brown arrived in Brussels early today to promote his plan to reform the Bretton Woods financial framework of 1944, which led to the establishment of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>In a meeting with Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European commission president, at 9.30am - more than five hours before the formal start of the summit - Brown distributed a new paper which called for:</p> <p>\u2022 a new early-warning system for the world economy to ensure that problems are anticipated earlier,</p> <p>\u2022 a new framework to ensure crises are dealt with better as they arise,</p> <p>\u2022 better surveillance of what is happening in the world economy so that people are aware on one continent of what is happening on other continents, and</p> <p>\u2022 a new cross-border college of supervisors to monitor the world's top 30 countries that trade across borders.</p> <p>Brown said: \"We believe that the trust that has been lost in the financial system will be best built for the future by people agreeing to these proposals. I want to see a timetable for agreeing these proposals over the next few weeks and months.\"</p> <p>The prime minister, who first called for reform of Bretton Woods in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis, said he hoped world leaders would now accept his proposals. \"We need to reform the international system in a more profound way so that it meets the challenges of the future. The institutions like the IMF and the World Bank were created for the circumstances of 60 years ago. We now have global markets. Instead of simply having national supervisors we need a global way of supervising our international system.\"</p> <p>The prime minister hopes that the EU's 27 leaders, who will discuss the financial crisis in their session before dinner tonight, will agree to the proposals in the coming weeks. That would allow the four EU members of the G8 - Britain, France, Germany and Italy - to present a united front at the world summit, which will include the G8 members plus major economies such as Brazil and India. Brown hopes the meeting will take place in November or December.</p> <p>Brown said: \"I believe that a forum to decide big changes in the international economy can be held in the next few months. I said I wouldn't put a specific date on it because that is what has to be agreed with all countries. </p> <p>\"There have been discussions with all the major countries about the desirability of this and when it would be most appropriate. There is now general agreement that there should be an international leaders' meeting. There is agreement that the agenda should include far-reaching reform of the international financial system.\"</p> <p>The prime minister received a warm welcome in Brussels today in the wake of the decision of Hank Paulson, the US treasury secretary, and EU countries to implement bank rescue plans along the lines of Britain's plan. </p> <p>But eyebrows were raised today when Brown circulated his new paper. Under EU convention it is for the country holding the rotating presidency -- currently France - to do that.</p>",

  "<p>Rio Tinto sent a shock wave through <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/mining\">the mining sector</a> and triggered wider concerns about a global recession by warning of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">a major slowdown in China</a>. </p> <p>The company saying it was now revising its capital spending plans and would miss its end-of-year target of making $10bn (\u00a35.65bn) worth of disposals.</p> <p>Shares in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/riotinto\">Rio Tinto </a>and other rival stocks fell by up to 9% as the miner said it was cutting back production at some of its aluminium smelters. The moves came as the Aluminium Corporation of China, Chalco, decided to reduce its local output in reaction to a 40% slide in some local prices over the last couple of months.</p> <p>\"The Chinese economy is pausing for breath after spectacular GDP growth,\" said Tom Albanese, the chief executive of Rio Tinto. \"Although not immune from the weakness in OECD countries, the China slowdown is largely caused by last year's tightening of Chinese monetary policy to address inflation.\"</p> <p>He added that third quarter economic data would underline the reduction in demand which was being exaggerated by by the temporary halting of industrial projects during the Olympics. \"There will inevitably be an impact on Chinese exports from these factors.\"</p> <p>The views from the mining group reinforce fears that China - the engine of world industrial growth over the last five years - is beginning to stutter. Some critics say the rulers of the world's most populous nation have presided over an bubble economy that is just waiting to pop.</p> <p>But Rio Tinto believes China's long-term growth pattern can be sustained while the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has just put out a report arguing the west's financial crisis and world economic slowdown \"won't change the (strong) fundamentals of the Chinese economy\". </p> <p>Dick Evans, a colleague of Albanese at Rio Tinto, said some growth projects were being put on hold in the aluminium sector while there was going to be production cutbacks at two or three of its high-cost smelters. If prices fall further then we might accelerate that,\" said Evans, chief executive of the Rio Tinto Alcan business. </p> <p>The company was originally planning to boost aluminium output from 4m tonnes to 7m tonnes but at least some of this has been put on ice. Evans said he had heard that 1m tonnes of production had been shut down in China, around 7% of the nation's total.</p> <p>Chalco, the world's third largest alumina producer, revealed it was shutting in a further 1m tonnes of production at its Shandong plant on top of the 300,000 tonnes already halted. The closure would leave Shandong running at 200,000 tonnes of its 1.5m capacity.</p> <p>Weiqiao Aluminium, the second largest alumina producer in China after Chalco, said it too had closed half of its 4m tonne a year capacity while another local rival, the Lubei Group, said it was also closing a 1m tonne a year capacity facility. </p> <p>Rio Tinto, facing a takeover threat from BHP Billiton, said it had overall performed very well in the third quarter and was well-placed for the future. </p> <p>But it admitted that its disposal programme was being made harder by the decline in commodity prices and uncertainties over the global economy. This also made it prudent to reconsider capital spending plans.</p> <p>Charles Kernot, mining analyst at Evolution Securities, said the Rio Tinto announcements were important. \"We take the view, as with the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic, that the forthcoming recession will be severe and see a marked global contraction in commodity demand. The slowdown in significant capital expenditure projects and recognition that it cannot sell US$10bn of non-core assets before the end of this year implies that Rio Tinto agrees with the politicians.\"</p> <p>BHP warned on Monday that China was slowing down but it said that it had no intention of cutting back any production or capital spending. </p> <p>Meanwhile Rio Tinto, facing a hostile $160bn takeover offer from BHP, announced that it had run up record production levels of iron ore in the third quarter, up 17% year on year, and seen a 40% increase in Australian hard coking coal and a 13% growth in uranium output.</p>",
  "<p>Is unemployment \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/15/unemploymentdata-recession\">now rising sharply</a> \u2013 set to be the major economic, social and political issue over the coming months and years?</p> <p>The boom years of the \"roaring 20s\" ended with the bust that was the Wall Street crash of 1929, followed by the great depression. Mass unemployment led to the rise of Hitler in Germany. In America, the New Deal got people back into jobs through public work programmes. In Britain, Keynes published his <a href=\"http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/\">General Theory</a>, which warned that market economies had no automatic tendency to create full employment, so government action was needed. But it was only the second world war that solved the global unemployment problem.</p> <p>\"No return to the 1930s\" was thus a strong driver to ensure that post-war reconstruction was followed by Keynesian demand management to sustain full employment. For a generation, it was thought that the problem of unemployment had been solved.</p> <p>By the 1970s, though, the long post-war boom was creating inflationary pressures. Anti-inflationary policies led to the return of unemployment, and this was given a dramatic upward twist by the monetarist policies of the Thatcher governments from 1979. Unemployment topped the 3m mark, before falling during the Lawson boom of the late 1980s, rising again in the early 1990s with Britain's ill-fated attempt to join the European <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Exchange_Rate_Mechanism\">exchange rate mechanism</a>. The subsequent cuts in interest rates and devaluation launched what has proved to be a 16-year era of uninterrupted growth \u2013 trumpeted as the \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6986469.stm\">end to boom and bust</a>\".</p> <p>As we can now see, the truth is rather different. The greatest bust since 1929 has been averted only by the part-nationalisation of most of the major banks, plus billions of pounds of taxpayers' money also being made available to create credit, and with the government guaranteeing bank accounts and inter-bank loans. </p> <p>So, while a global crash may have been averted, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/15/banking-europe\">will the economy still slide into recession with 2m unemployed</a> by Christmas?</p> <p>Unemployment will certainly rise. The only question is whether we will see the third-highest unemployment figures since the second world war \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2008/aug/15/unemployment\">after the early 1980s and early 1990s</a> \u2013 or whether the coming recession will prove worse than that of the early 1990s?</p> <p>The bad news is that the boom years were based heavily on the financial sector and the City of London. This disguised a continuing weakening of the economy's manufacturing base. It is true that the divide between manufacturing and services has, in many cases, become blurred. But this doesn't necessarily make manufacturing less important \u2013 in many cases, quite the contrary. Britain thus missed out on the huge industrial opportunities around green technologies, where Germany, the US and others have taken advantage while we were celebrating the success of our light regulation encouraging financial risk-taking.</p> <p>The good news is that action has at last been taken. But the nationalised and part-nationalised banks need to be encouraged to lend to sustainable business. Unemployment won't be solved by labour market flexibility that makes firing people easier, but by functional flexibility, which encourages retraining and reskilling. The government's policy whereby they will only fund a second degree if it is in the same subject as your first degree \u2013 and therefore at a higher level \u2013 is the exact opposite of what is needed, and should be scrapped. If someone is prepared to pursue a degree in a new subject, and hence at the same level as their existing degree, they should be supported and applauded.</p> <p>To prevent large-scale unemployment will require long-term investment, innovations in real products rather than financial trickery, and a functionally flexible workforce.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond\">Alex Salmond</a> has challenged Gordon Brown to a \"toe-to-toe\" debate about the economy and the rising cost of living after the prime minister confirmed he plans to campaign in the Glenrothes byelection.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/snp\">Scottish National party</a> leader formally launched his party's byelection campaign in the Fife constituency this morning and called on the UK government to spend several billion pounds tackling fuel poverty this winter.</p> <p>The Scottish first minister said the SNP would make soaring living costs and the economy a key plank of its campaign to win the Westminster seat by overturning a 10,664 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> majority, inflicting its second byelection defeat on the government this year.</p> <p>\"This is a winter byelection, and that will concentrate minds wonderfully in this campaign,\" he said. \"I detect that the political earth is still shaking from Glasgow East and it's going to be felt next here in Glenrothes.\"</p> <p>Salmond knows the prime minister is highly unlikely to stage a debate \u2013 Labour insists the byelection should be fought by the candidates, not party leaders.</p> <p>But Salmond today tried to turn the campaign into a popularity contest between his government and the Labour government in London \u2013 a tactic he successfully used in the last week of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glasgoweast\">Glasgow East byelection</a>.</p> <p>It emerged last night that Brown has written personally to all Labour MPs and peers \"urging\" them all to visit the constituency and support the party's battle to hold the seat.</p> <p>The prime minister said both he and his wife Sarah expected to do so, \"subject to the global financial situation\". Her unexpected appearance to introduce Brown's speech to the Labour conference last month helped bolster his leadership.</p> <p>In a measure of the byelection's significance to Brown \u2013 the seat borders his constituency of <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/hoc/constituency/0,,-1059,00.html\">Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath</a> - the party's whips had been instructed to help every MP and peer join the campaign, either in person or by phoning voters.</p> <p>Labour believes the prime minister's success in tackling the global financial crisis has transformed the party's fortunes. Last night, Brown claimed in a BBC Scotland interview that the scale of the banking crisis completely undermined the SNP's case that an independent Scotland could prosper.</p> <p>Salmond claimed Brown's \u00a350bn financial rescue package would fail to combat rising unemployment, the latest jump in inflation or the sharply increasing cost of living.</p> <p>The first minister pledged to match the dozen visits he made during the three weeks of the Glasgow East byelection, urging voters to support the SNP. \"Battle will be joined and the issue will be toe-to-toe,\" Salmond said, adding later: \"I would be delighted to debate with the prime minister anywhere in this seat.\"</p> <p>David Cameron, the Conservative leader, has already challenged Brown to campaign in Glenrothes, claiming two months ago the prime minister was scared to visit in person.</p> <p>The nationalists hope that Brown's appearances in Glenrothes could backfire, since they anticipate he will only attend staged events with invited guests, to avoid unscripted meetings with voters and for security reasons.</p> <p>A Labour spokesman said: \"This is a typical SNP stunt. Alex Salmond seems to be planning to spend more time in Glenrothes than actually running the country, like in Glasgow East, when he gave up running Scotland to run their byelection campaign.\"</p> <p>The SNP should instead concentrate on allowing their candidate, local council leader Peter Grant, to debate the issues face-to-face with Labour's candidate, Lindsay Roy, the head teacher at Brown's old secondary school in Kirkcaldy, he added.</p> <p>Salmond called on the government to suspend the 5% VAT paid on domestic energy this winter, at a cost of \u00a31.5bn across the UK; increase winter fuel relief to pensioners by another \u00a3100 on top of the \u00a350 or \u00a3100 increases already announced by ministers; and cut VAT on all home energy efficiency measures to 5%.</p> <p>The party said the extra fuel relief for Scottish pensioners would cost \u00a368m in Scotland, and later said it would cost \u00a3620m across the UK. The current reduction in VAT by ministers for some energy efficiency measure to 5% had failed to cover labour costs and some materials, so was insufficient, it added. </p> <p>\"We're saying it's time for a fair deal on energy prices in this constituency, where average fuel bills are now \u00a31,400 per family, with bill increases of 40% have thudded through letter boxes in the last few years,\" Salmond said. </p> <p>A Downing Street source dismissed Salmond's challenge. \"Alex Salmond's economic illiteracy is becoming more apparent and more embarrassing for Scotland every day. The prime minister is spending every moment he can combating the global economic crisis, trying to ensure that people's jobs are secure, bank deposits are secure and mortgages are secure, and to draw down food and fuel prices.</p> <p>\"While he's doing that, Alex Salmond can try to convince the people of Scotland to become like Iceland.\"</p> <p>The byelection will be held on November 6, following the death in August of the Labour MP John MacDougall, the former council leader and close ally of Brown's, who held Glenrothes for seven years.</p> <p>Although Brown's fortunes have changed markedly after Labour conference thanks to his handling of the global financial crisis, the byelection could yet be crucial to his future as Labour leader. </p> <p>The SNP are favourites to win the seat, partly since opinion polls suggest the SNP has its first ever lead over Labour in a UK general election, although senior party figures admit it will now be a far tougher campaign and are trying to dampen predictions they are expecting to win.</p> <p>The nationalists hold the equivalent Scottish parliament seat, control the council in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, and have been quietly campaigning in Glenrothes since MacDougall's terminal illness become public.</p> <p>However, Labour sources insist their vote is solid, and growing, with Tory supporters switching to stop the SNP winning the seat. Jim Murphy, the new Scottish secretary, has said Brown was a tremendous asset for the party in Fife and commanded significant local respect and loyalty.</p> <p>Full list of candidates declared so far:</p> <p><strong>Labour:</strong> Lindsay Roy</p> <p><strong>Scottish National party:</strong> Peter Grant</p> <p><strong>Liberal Democrats:</strong> Harry Wills</p> <p><strong>Conservatives:</strong> Maurice Golden</p> <p><strong>Scottish Socialist party:</strong> Morag Balfour</p> <p><strong>Solidarity:</strong> Louise McLeary</p> <p><strong>UK Independence party:</strong> Kris Seunarine</p>",

The use of standard engines from 2010 is just one of the proposals outlined by FIA president Max Mosley in a letter to the 10 teams ahead of a meeting in Geneva next week.</p> <p>\"The FIA believes that formula one costs are unsustainable,\" it said. \"Even before the current global financial problems, teams were spending far more than their incomes.\" Mosley, whose plan, if accepted, will be implemented over five years, expects revenue from sponsors to dry up after several high-profile backers became embroiled in the credit crunch.</p> <p>\"There is now a real danger that in some cases these subsidies will cease,\" added the FIA. \"This could result in a reduction in the number of competitors, adding to the two team vacancies we already have and reducing the grid to an unacceptable level.\" Honda-backed Super Aguri folded after the Spanish grand prix in April while a planned Prodrive team has been shelved. Meanwhile, former champions Williams are sponsored by bailed-out bank RBS and companies owned by troubled Icelandic retailer Baugur. </p> <p>Three proposals have been put to the Formula One Teams Association (Fota) for the period between 2010 and 2012. They include a call for an homologated engine produced by a single supplier, after a tender, with current engine makers free to build their own to the same design. Another idea would be for a consortium of teams to obtain a low cost engine from a single supplier, while a third alternative, proposed by Fota, would provide independent teams with a powertrain (engine and gearbox) for less than \u00a33.8m per team per season.</p> <p>The latter arrangement would also include 30,000km of testing and on-track assistance. The FIA also said it is considering common chassis parts such as standard suspension and wheels and other expensive parts which \"add nothing to the spectacle or to the public interest of formula one\".</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/britishairways\">British Airways</a> today <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/30/britishairwaysbusiness.theairlineindustry\">reduced its fuel surcharges</a>, bringing relief to some passengers following similar moves by rivals and a prolonged dip in the global oil price. </p> <p>BA has reduced the levy on long-haul flights for economy class passengers but left charges for business class customers unchanged. </p> <p>From midnight, the surcharge on return flights lasting longer than nine hours - to Cape Town and Delhi, for example - will fall from \u00a3218 per ticket to \u00a3192 per ticket for anyone travelling in the back of the airplane. The surcharge will drop from \u00a3156 per return flight to \u00a3136 for long-haul economy class journeys lasting less then nine hours, such as Heathrow to New York or Montreal. </p> <p>For premium economy passengers on long-haul flights under nine hours, the charge comes down from \u00a3176 per return to \u00a3166; for return flights of more than nine hours, it is reduced from \u00a3229 to \u00a3222. Levies for short-haul flights and for business class passengers will stay the same, a BA spokesman said. </p> <p>The airline's decision to reduce surcharges for only the second time since they were introduced in 2004 follows surcharge reductions by Air France-KLM and close rival <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/15/virginatlantic-theairlineindustry\">Virgin Atlantic</a>, which has reduced its economy class surcharges by the same amount as BA. </p> <p>Ryanair has criticised BA for keeping its fuel surcharges at the same level as when oil cost just under $150 per barrel, acccusing the airline of charging passengers disproportionately in order to protect profits during a downturn. </p> <p>BA argued the stronger dollar wiped out some of the gains from a lower oil price, but with oil now trading below $80 per barrel, it has decided to act. </p> <p>\"Other airlines have made a move on surcharges and BA needs to respond in order to keep its fares competitive,\" said Douglas McNeill, an analyst at BlueOar Securities. </p> <p>BA's September traffic has been severely affected by the credit crunch. Nine of its top 20 corporate customers come from the banking sector and the airline reported an 8.6% slump in business traffic last month and said \"increased anxiety\" in global stockmarkets was affecting bookings. </p> <p>Total passenger numbers in September fell by 5.6% on the same month last year as the airline carried 165,000 fewer customers. </p> <p>The traffic numbers reflect a downturn in BA's profitable corporate customer base, but they also reflect the consequences of passing much of the fuel price increase into fares. BA's fuel bill is expected to top \u00a33bn this year and the airline has raised fares by 7% so far this year, as well as rasing surcharges, in order to cover the cost. </p> <p>Low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, whose business model is predicated on filling more than eight out of 10 seats per flight, have responded to the crisis by slashing fares in order to prop up demand. </p> <p>BA is also covering the cost increase by cutting jobs \u2013 450 managers have applied for voluntary redundancy. </p> <p>The chief executive, Willie Walsh, has described the high oil price and the economic downturn as a \"devastating combination\" for an airline industry that has lost about 30 carriers to bankruptcy so far this year. </p> <p>Fuel now accounts for more than a third of most airlines' cost bases, leaving them with the option of cutting jobs or raising fares - or both - to shore up profits. Even with those actions, the most profitable airlines worldwide, including Ryanair and BA, expect to do no better than break even this year.</p>",
  "<p>Today, as you doubtless know, is <a href=\"http://blogactionday.org/\">Blog Action Day</a>, when the online community is encouraged to turn its attention to a particular issue of global importance. This year the theme chosen is poverty, which seems pretty apt, given the parlous state of the world economy. It also fits nicely with the fact that we are midway towards the 2015 target date for achieving the anti-poverty <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\">millennium development goals</a>.</p> <p>Yet when I was asked to take part in today's initiative, I was more than a little wary. There's something a bit uncomfortable about calling on everyone to concentrate on an issue for a day and then moving on glibly to the next one. The <a href=\"http://site.blogactionday.org/about/2007-the-environment/\"> environment</a> was last year's theme. Does that mean we sorted it out, then?</p> <p>As I see it, the good thing about blogs and online spaces such as Comment is free is that they offer us, as readers, an opportunity to gain access to a far broader spread of specialists and other informed voices than we would otherwise enjoy. Unless you are prepared to subscribe to a large number of technical publications, at some personal expense, you are unlikely to have access to a fraction of the issues raised in the blogosphere. </p> <p>The hard copy versions of the national newspapers tend to be based around their own columnists and the occasional offerings by high-profile politicians or cultural figures. Their online equivalents, by contrast, offer a far broader range of specialist writers \u2013 for free. Comments back from the wider community offer a further set of perspectives, as well as links through to other sources to compare and contrast.</p> <p>This is particularly important when it comes to today's theme of poverty. Most media outlets have a host of in-house correspondents dedicated to reporting on business, economics and other aspects of wealth creation. Few have a single reporter <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ifs/hi/newsid_3660000/newsid_3660200/3660257.stm\">dedicated</a> to poverty or international development issues. This leads to regular misrepresentation in the media, where political correspondents often fail to apply the usual checks and balances to official statements simply because they do not have the expertise or the interest to spot dodgy claims.</p> <p>Last month's international poverty summit in New York was a case in point. Rather than addressing the underlying <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/25/unitednations.internationalaidanddevelopment\">reasons</a> why the international community is failing to tackle global poverty, those media commentators which covered the summit at all were content to depoliticise it and simply record world leaders' statements of concern and renewed intent. The Guardian's own 16-page <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/alloutonpoverty\">supplement</a> on the summit was actually paid for by the British government, and suitably complimentary of it.</p> <p>Similarly, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/default.stm\"> Newsnight</a> had planned a studio debate on the merits, or otherwise, of the world trade talks as they sought in vain to escape from <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7526043.stm\">crisis</a> this July. In the end they replaced this with a live interview of British trade minister Gareth Thomas, which was a good opportunity to put him on the spot over the government's failure to honour Labour party commitments on trade policy. Yet the interview failed to challenge the government on a single point, and Thomas was allowed to get away scot-free.</p> <p>The problem is symptomatic of a more general trend away from having specialists within the media, as Nick Davies has described in his account of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/04/comment.pressandpublishing\">churnalism</a> that characterises much of today's press coverage. Yet there's also a clear hierarchy that condemns issues such as poverty to a marginal status. Along with correspondents devoted to industrial relations, journalists with a specialist background in international development are an endangered species.</p> <p>The same applies to broadcasting, if not more so. As shown in the International Broadcasting Trust's latest <a href=\"http://www.ibt.org.uk/research.php\">survey</a>, international factual programming on the main four terrestrial channels has now reached its lowest level since the surveys started 20 years ago. Many of the programmes filmed in developing countries are devoted to wildlife, holidays or reality TV shows spiced up through being shot in exotic locations. Politics, development and environmental themes now represent a meagre 7% of all international factual programming on terrestrial TV.</p> <p>This is where the online community comes into its own, as it can turn the political spotlight on such issues and question the establishment line. For this reason alone, today's blogging initiative is welcome. Raising the number of dissenting voices on an issue as important as global poverty can only be a good thing.</p> <p>I do have one problem with blog action day, however. As well as giving time to take part in the blogging, the website encourages people to donate money \u2013 a day's earnings is the suggestion \u2013 to a good cause. As director of a <a href=\"http://www.waronwant.org/Stand20With20Us3A20Donate20Now+14081.twl\">charity</a> that relies on such donations from the public, I have no quarrel with that. </p> <p>Yet the official partner recommended for blog action day is the <a href=\"http://www.theglobalfund.org/EN/\">Global Fund</a> to fight Aids, tuberculosis and malaria.

In the 1960s, the west African country was home to about 100,000 of the apes; in 1989-1990, scientists counted 8,000 to 12,000, which they estimated to be half the remaining population of the species. The most recent count turned up 800 to 1,200 chimps.

  "<p><strong>\"Wolves have Mick McCarthy following Glenn Hoddle and Graham Taylor; Manchester City have Mark Hughes succeeding Sven-Goran Eriksson and Kevin Keegan,\"</strong> muses Cliff Challenger, <strong>\"but which club has been managed by the greatest number international managers/coaches?\"</strong></p> <p>Well, Cliff, Wolves and Manchester City don't come very close we're afraid. Peter Reid's recent appointment as Thailand manager takes City's tally up to six - Peter Reid (Thailand), Joe Mercer (England), Kevin Keegan (England), Mark Hughes (Wales), Sven-Goran Eriksson (Mexico and England) and Malcolm Allison (Kuwait) - which is about as good as we can do for English clubs. On the continent, however, clubs have historically had a more global outlook with their managerial appointments.</p> <p>First we headed over to Italy, where we were impressed with Milan's tally of eight, mightily impressed with Juve's nine and then blown away by Inter's 14 international coaches. They are (or were): H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper (Georgia), Giovanni Trapattoni (Italy/Rep Ireland), Marco Tardelli (Egypt), Marcello Lippi (Italy), Roy Hodgson (Switzerland and Finland), Mircea Lucescu (Romania), Luis Suarez (Spain), Helenio Herrera (Italy, Spain and France), Heriberto Herrera (Paraguay), Alfredo Foni (Italy and Switzerland), Jesse Carver (Holland), Giuseppe Meazza (Italy), Carlo Carcano (Italy) and Giovanni Ferrari (Italy). </p> <p>Elsewhere in Europe, plenty of clubs hit double figures in international coaches, including Partizan Belgrade (10), Ajax (11), Steaua Bucharest (12) and Benfica (14), but it is in Spain where most managers have also enjoyed coaching countries. Real Madrid weigh in with 15 - Fabio Capello (England), Vanderlei Luxemburgo (Brazil), Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho (Spain), Carlos Queiroz (Portugal), Vicente del Bosque (Spain), John Toshack (Wales), Guus Hiddink (Russia, Holland, South Korea and Australia), Leo Beenhakker (Holland, Saudi Arabia, T&amp;T, Poland), Luis Molowny (Spain), Vujadin Boskov (Yugoslavia), Miljan Miljanic (Yugoslavia), Manuel Fleitas Solich (Paraguay), Jos\u00e9 Villalonga (Spain), Jacinto Quincoces (Spain) and Francisco Bru (Spain) - while <em>el clasico</em> rivals Barcelona trump that with 18 - Dom\u00e8nec Balmanya (Spain), Salvador Artigas (Spain), Luis Aragon\u00e9s (Spain), Radomir Antic (current Serbia), Ljubisa Brocic (Kuwait), Ferdinand Dauc\u00edk (Czechoslovakia), Enrique Fern\u00e1ndez Viola (Uruguay), Louis van Gaal (Holland), Jack Greenwell (Peru), Helenio Herrera (Italy, Spain and France), Ladislao Kubala (Paraguay), C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti (Mexico), Rinus Michels (Holland), Franz Platko (Chile), Sandro Puppo (Turkey), Frank Rijkaard (Holland), Bobby Robson (England) and, of course, Terry Venables (England and Australia).</p> <p>Both those Spanish giants, though, are beaten by Madrid's city rivals Atl\u00e9tico. Helenio Herrera (Italy, Spain and France), Tomislav Ivic (Iran, UAE and Croatia), Otto Gl\u00f3ria (Nigeria), C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti (Argentina and Mexico), Ferdinand Daucik (Czechoslovakia /Slovakia), Domenec Balmanya (Spain), Fred Pentland (France, Germany and Spain), Jos\u00e9 Villalonga Llorente (Spain), Juan Carlos Lorenzo (Argentina, Spain and France), Luis Aragon\u00e9s (Spain), Alfio Basile (Argentina), Javier Aguirre (Mexico), Arrigo Sacchi (Italy), Radomir Antic (Serbia), H\u00e9ctor N\u00fa\u00f1ez (Uruguay), Javier Clemente (Spain), Omar Pastoriza (El Salvador and Venezuela), Francisco Maturana (Colombia, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Peru and Trinidad &amp; Tobago) and Ricardo Zamora (Spain) have all managed Atl\u00e9tico and their country of choice, 19 managers in total.</p> <p><strong>THE BIGGEST PLUG OUTSIDE THE BFG'S BATH</strong><br>Coming soon, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbooks.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10401_25501_132806_100_38603_38603_category_\">The Knowledge in book form</a>, a collection of our favourite questions and answers from the past eight years.</p> <p><strong>THE BIG THREE?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/23/premierleague.manchesterunited\"><br>A couple of weeks back</a> we looked into the relationship between matches involving the Big Four and their impact on the final Premier League table. After being slapped on the wrist for including Liverpool in our study - \"They have finished an average of 23 points behind the leader in those six seasons (nearer relegation than the top),\" pointed out one reader - we threw the Reds out of our equation and found that not much changed really.<br><strong><br>2002/03 PREMIER LEAGUE:</strong> Man U 83pts, Arsenal 78, Chelsea 67, <br><strong>BIG THREE LEAGUE:</strong> Man U 8pts, Arsenal 5, Chelsea 2<br> <strong>2003/04 PREMIER LEAGUE: </strong>Arsenal 90pts, Chelsea 79, Man U 75 <br><strong>BIG THREE LEAGUE: </strong>Arsenal 8pts, Chelsea 4, Man U 3<br> <strong>2004/05 PREMIER LEAGUE: </strong>Chelsea 95pts, Arsenal 83, Man U 77<br><strong>BIG THREE LEAGUE: </strong>Chelsea 8pts, Man U 6, Arsenal 2 <br> <strong>2005/06 PREMIER LEAGUE: </strong>Chelsea 91pts, Man U 83, Arsenal 67<br><strong>BIG THREE LEAGUE: </strong>Chelsea 9pts, Man U 7, Arsenal 1 <br> <strong>2006/07 PREMIER LEAGUE: </strong>Man U 89pts, Chelsea 83, Arsenal 68 <br><strong>BIG THREE LEAGUE: </strong>Arsenal 8pts, Chelsea 4, Man U 2<br> <strong>2007/08 PREMIER LEAGUE: </strong>Man U 87pts, Chelsea 85, Arsenal 83 <br><strong>BIG THREE LEAGUE: </strong>Man U 10pts, Chelsea 6, Arsenal 4</p> <p>As you can see, the winner of the Big Three mini-league has bagged the title in five of the last six seasons. The 2006-07 season is the only time the natural order of things was disturbed. Arsenal took eight points off Chelsea and Manchester United, yet only finished fourth in the title race. While it would be foolish to suggest that the Premier League is ultimately decided each year by just six games, it lends a degree of truth to the words of fans and managers up and down the country who swear the Big Three are in a league of their own. </p> <p><strong>POOL OF TALENT</strong></p> <p><strong>\"I've noticed that there are three Scottish managers in Group E of the Champions League this year \u2013 Sir Alex Ferguson, Bruce Rioch and Gordon Strachan,\"</strong> writes Grant Campbell. <strong>\"Have there ever been more managers from one country in a European group?\"</strong></p> <p>In short, no. The same has happened twice before, though only in the Uefa Cup, we're afraid. First up is the 2005-6 season.</p> <p>Group G was a family affair in 2005, with Rapid Bucharest's Radvan Lucescu - known to the fans without even a hint of irony as the \"Jose Mourinho of Guilesti\"- facing up to his father Mircea, coach of Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk. Lucescu Jr got the better of Dad, with Rapid stealing a late 1-0 win at the Olympiyski Stadium, and despite Lucescu Sr's rather melodramatic complaint that \"it's a disaster for my whole family that this match must be played\", Christmas at the Lucescu house was still a happy one as both sides eventually made it through to the knock-out stages. </p> <p>Stade Rennais coach Ladislau Boloni- capped over 100 times by his country- could only look on enviously at his compatriots as his side finished bottom of the group. The French side's foray into Europe may have ended with nil points, but Romania could look on with pride at the success of their prodigal sons. </p> <p>One year earlier, Group B provided us with three more, Italians this time. Parma (Silvio Baldini), Steaua Bucharest (Walter Zenga) and Standard Li\u00e8ge (Domenico D'Onofrio) injected some Italian flair into the group, though Standard were the side to see themselves slip out after a shocking 7-1 defeat at home to Ernesto Valverde's Atl\u00e9tico Bilbao. Valverde, disappointingly for us, is Spanish.</p> <p><strong>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</strong></p> <p><strong>\"What is the earliest time a professional match has ever kicked off?\"</strong> wondered Kate Haldane back in 2005.</p> <p>During the 2003-04 season, Bar\u00e7a were scheduled to play a midweek game against Sevilla prior to an international weekend. Since Fifa rules stipulate players summoned for international duty must be released by their clubs four days before the match, the Catalans hoped to host Sevilla on the Tuesday, September 3, rather than the next day when their internationals would have been missing. However, sensing a chance to take on a below-strength opponent, Sevilla refused, pointing out that a club cannot play two matches within 48 hours (after the Sunday fixture programme), unless both teams were agreed.</p> <p>Quick-thinking suits at Bar\u00e7a then hit upon a novel idea: play the game as early on Wednesday morning as possible and hope their international stars would still be allowed to play. Thus, the game kicked off at 12.05am - alas, the only national association to accept Barca's ploy was the Portuguese one, who allowed winger Ricardo Quaresma to take part.</p> <p>Incredibly, 80,000 fans turned up ... though it's not actually incredible at all when you consider that the club laid on free gaspacho and 100,000 complementary Kit Kats. Also, stand-up comics entertained the crowd before live telephone link-ups with Ronald Koeman and Hristo Stoichkov worked them into a frenzy. The players ran out to the Village People's YMCA [no, we're not sure either], but it clearly worked, as the supporters only hushed once during the match, when Jose Antonio Reyes's penalty gave the visitors the lead. Ronaldinho's first - spectacular, naturally - goal for the club salvaged a 1-1 draw, the roar greeting his strike reportedly registering on the city's earthquake monitors.</p> <p>A special mention must also go to Coventry City's [then known as Singer's FC] FA Cup match with Burton Swifts in 1892, as Joe Myall explains. \"As Burton played in a higher division, they had the right to arrange the game as and when they felt it would least impinge on their league programme.\" The match kicked off at 8am.</p> <p>For many more sepia-tinged questions and answers, why not visit the Knowledge archive.</p> <p><strong>CAN YOU HELP?</strong></p> <p>\"With Joe Kinnear effectively appointed caretaker manager at Newcastle for six games, I was wondering which caretaker has kept a managerial hotseat warm for longest?\" asks Pat Kerry.</p> <p>\"Apart from goalkeepers who's won the most caps without scoring a goal for their country?\" wonders Marcus Massey.</p> <p>\"Who were the last team to qualify for European competition by winning a cup competition outright, despite being outside the top-flight?\" muses Peter Clegg.</p> <p>\"Was Blackburn Ladies' recent defeat against Portsmouth, in which they had <a href=\"http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/3733691.Lakeland_anger_as_four_sent_off_for_Blackburn_Ladies/\">four players sent off</a>, the dirtiest women's match ever?\" wonders Alex Fortune.</p> <p>Send your questions and answers to <a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">knowledge@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Since 1992, more than \u00a355bn worth of private finance initiative <a href=\"http://www.nao.org.uk/practice_areas/private_finance/recommendations.htm\">(PFI) contracts</a> have been awarded by central and local government to a range of private companies to build the nation's hospitals, schools, roads and even leisure centres and waste incinerators. But with the credit crunch pushing up the cost of borrowing and an economic downturn threatening companies' very survival should we be entrusting our infrastructure to the likes of <a href=\"http://www.capita.co.uk\">Capita</a>, <a href=\"http://www.serco.com\">Serco</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amey.co.uk\">Amey plc</a>? </p> <p>Are we likely to see half built buildings and highways as companies go bust, or will government be unable to afford to rent back over 25 or 30 years the projects that are built and maintained by private companies? Is Amey's attempt to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/12/economy-policy\">withdraw its sponsorship</a> of a city academy a wake-up call?</p> <p>Chris Ecob, head of infrastructure finance at <a href=\"http://www.mottmac.com\">Mott MacDonald</a>, a global management, engineering and development consultancy that advises on a number of large-scale PFI deals says he has not seen anything that indicates that the 700-plus PFI projects are being scrapped. \"For most that have been set in motion, legal terms and conditions will require that the projects continue and are delivered on time and operate as agreed\" says Ecob. </p> <p>But he does admit that some PFI sectors appear likely to weather the storm more strongly than others. \"For example, legal directives dictate that waste PFI projects are going ahead to meet the 2013 deadline to halve waste disposal sent to landfill. Similarly the <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page5801\">Building Schools for the Future programme</a> is proceeding, designed to replace many inefficient school buildings built back in the 70s, or earlier, with the new schools designed to provide a focal hub for their local communities,\" he says.</p> <p>And Mott MacDonald is beginning to see a slow down on newer deals reaching financial close, says Ecob. \"We expect that regeneration projects may be slowed down over the next couple of years or so.\" The reason for this? \"Financing of PFIs may become more difficult if the liquidity problem doesn't ease and the authorities who have money tied up in failed banks may have to put major investment projects on hold,\" he predicts.</p> <p>\"Risk is an important determining factor in making investment decisions. PFI spreads some of the risk away from the public sector, transferring it onto the private sector, and PFI can still be an attractive proposition where major cost-intensive infrastructure is desperately needed,\" he explains. </p> <p>The crux of the matter for Ecob is \"whether UK financial PLC and its global counterparts can afford to invest in new major infrastructure, given the current economic climate\". </p> <p>\"Government has identified that there are needs that must be addressed; with the UK population's growth rate being one of the highest in Europe, people will continue to need schools and hospitals as well as all the other public sector buildings and services that PFI is helping to deliver.\"</p> <p>He concludes that it is too early to say whether UK PFI projects are going to become seriously damaged by the financial market freefall, but advises \"caution seems to be the order of the day\". </p> <p>Ken Anderson, managing director of <a href=\"http://www.ubs.com\">UBS investment bank</a> and former commercial director at the Department of Health, is more bullish. \"PFI projects tend to be very safe, risk free and pensions funds like to hold money in them. The final guarantor is the government so it doesn't get much better than that.\" But he admits that if deals aren't yet \"inked\", some may not stack up on value for money. \"Some may be scaled back if there are issues of affordability around debt,\" says Anderson. But he has not heard of companies playing \"hard ball\" to renegotiate contracts in the face of higher borrowing costs. \"Even if debt is more expensive PFI deals are still a very safe bet. The borrowing window is always open for high quality debt.\"</p> <p>Overall, he sees the economic downturn as a \"wonderful opportunity\" to build infrastructure in the UK - \"if you look at how we come out of recessions government spends a lot of money\" - and to rejig the PFI model. He would like to see governments redesign contracts that pay for outputs rather than inputs and processes in order to ensure value for money for taxpayers and the end user. This would represent the <a href=\"http://www.nao.org.uk/practice_areas/private_finance/background.htm\">16 year old PFI</a> maturing from a teenager into an adult says Anderson.</p> <p>\"Of course budgets will be tighter and money less plentiful with the slow down in the economy, but the NHS, for example, is now far better at identifying priorities and targeting funds to get the infrastructure we need to treat patients.\" </p> <p>So no let up on PFI deals then? Says Anderson: \"If it makes sense and value for money, PFI will continue.\"</p> <p>But that could be a big \"If\".</p>",

  "<p>The news from the Lyric Hammersmith is that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2002/jul/06/rsc.whoswhoinbritishtheatre\">Sean Holmes</a> has been appointed the successor to artistic director David Farr, who is off to the RSC. It is, I think, an excellent choice: what Holmes lacks in experience of running a building or a company, he makes up for with all-round niceness and directing talent. Most importantly, he is one of the few directors around who has a foot both in new writing and more experimental work. Holmes is as comfortable with a David Storey or Arthur Miller revival, or a new piece such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/aug/04/edinburghfestival.festivals\">Simon Stephens's Pornography</a>, as he is with Filter's radical rethinks of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2007/aug/21/edinburghfestival2007.edinburghfestival2\">Twelfth Night </a>or The Caucasian Chalk Circle.</p> <p>This is important because <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatre\">theatre</a> is in a thrillingly fluid state at the moment. It is good to have someone in charge of a significant London theatre who understands that there is room for all kinds of work at the table. As Nick Hytner said recently, there is an unprecedented <a href=\"http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article4774791.ece\">explosion of rival voices </a>in British theatre practice, and buildings \"thrive on contradictory visions of the world and incompatible ways of making theatre.\" </p> <p>Variety is not just part of the National Theatre's fabric, but of the entire fabric of British theatre. We should embrace it. At the moment, experimental companies such as <a href=\"http://www.punchdrunk.org.uk/\">Punchdrunk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kneehigh.co.uk/\">Kneehigh</a> and <a href=\"http://www.filtertheatre.com/\">Filter</a> are getting as good a hearing as the voices that have dominated postwar British theatre. I suspect that artists such as Nic Green, Melanie Wilson and <a href=\"http://beescope.blogspot.com/\">Chris Goode </a>will soon follow. There is no going back. </p> <p>Under outgoing director <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/privatepassions/pip/km6nr/\">David Farr</a> the Lyric has been one of those theatres that, along with the National and venues such as <a href=\"http://www.bac.org.uk/\">BAC</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.gatetheatre.co.uk/\">Gate</a> (which has been transformed through the vision of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/apr/04/gender.theatre\">Carrie Cracknell and Natalie Abrahami</a>), has responded most vigorously to the profusion of new voices. Audiences may be bewitched and bothered by what they see, but they are seldom bewildered when confronted with new theatrical languages. I'm only sorry that he's going out on <a href=\"http://www.lyric.co.uk/fromhomepage/pl354.html\">a show as lame as Spyski</a>, because it strikes me that Farr has understood better than most that rigorous dramaturgy is crucial to visual and physical theatre.</p> <p>The Lyric's original job description suggested that the artistic directorship could have gone to a producer rather than a director (Stephen Unwin was replaced at <a href=\"http://www.ett.org.uk/\">ETT</a> by <a href=\"http://www.ett.org.uk/Press_and_Marketing/Press_releases/2007/ETT_to_become_the_first_Producer-led_touring_company_under_the_Directorship_of_Rachel_Tackley.html\">producer Rachel Tackley</a>), but I'm pretty sure that Holmes's appointment will be greeted favourably by everyone from playwrights to puppeteers. Anyone who doubts his ability to deal with both camps should remember that it was Holmes who had the bravery to take on Stephens's extraordinary Pornography after it frightened the horses at most of the UK's new writing theatres, and had the vision to pull it off.</p>",

The bank bail-outs and the impact of the credit crunch on the wider economy are likely to dominate.</p> <p>With British <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/15/unemploymentdata-recession\">unemployment posting its biggest rise</a> today since the last recession 17 years ago , MPs from all sides will want to know what is to be done to avert an unemployment boom by Christmas.</p> <p>MPs are also likely to seek reassurances from Harman that the government will work hard to ensure public bodies, notably councils, and charities that have their investment locked in Icelandic banks recover their money in full.</p> <p>The grilling is likely to include questions over the decision to scrap Sats tests for 14-year-olds, while keeping in place the two rounds of tests for primary school pupils at age seven and 11. </p> <p>The Conservatives might even remonstrate that the security minister, Lord West, chose to reveal that security services are investigating another great terrorist plot. Was it wise to make that public?</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>12:04pm:</strong> Harman rises and says a statement to the house will be made by Gordon Brown when he returns from the EU summit.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>12:05pm:</strong> My colleague <strong>Michael White</strong> texts from the Commons: \"It's Hattie vs Hague .

He asks whether the government is now ready to reform insolvency laws, to help businesses at such a critical time, to avoid further rises in the jobless numbers.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>12:07pm:</strong> Mike texts: \"Grim day as jobless totals rise , says sombre Hague. Will ministers reform bankruptcy laws? Done that- we are now speeding up mortgage help.\"</p> <p>Harman says the government is announcing \u00a3100m extra to help people who lose their jobs to help them to retrain to fill the 600,000 vacant jobs in the economy.</p> <p>Also, there will be extra help for people thrown on to the dole who have mortgages to pay. They will be helped to pay their mortgages after 13 weeks.</p> <p>Hague retorts that there is an expectation that unemployment is forecast to rise to 3 million by 2010. He says the money she cites has already been allocated to the skills budget and already announced. Why not adopt Tory proposals to resolve insolvency laws to prevent thousands of jobs going under, he asks.</p> <p>Harman fires back that there is no complacency from government over the threats to the economy, but hang on there, why write the economy off?</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>12:09pm:</strong> We're trying to stabilise the economy, both nationally and internationally, which is why the PM isn't here today.</p> <p>Hague says if she won't take the measures on insolvency that the Tories propose, what about pensioners locked into a lower pensions annuity as a result of the credit crunch? Will the government suspend the rules necessary to ensure these people do not suffer?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>12:10pm:</strong> Harman says the shock to businesses and the workplace has been sudden. We're helping pensioners with an increased fuel allowance, she says. The problem Hague raises affects some people and it is a concern, she says.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12:11pm:</strong> So will the government suspend the rule which stipulates pensioners have to opt for their annuity within a given timeframe, given the times we are in, asks Hague.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>12:12pm:</strong> Mike texts: \"Complacent, says William.

What would be the point of what the government has done otherwise?</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12:14pm:</strong> \"We want to re-establish credit lines to individual and small businesses,\" she says. She says all the measures the government took on Monday were backed by the Conservatives. So why isn't Hague backing the means to get to those ends?</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>12:15pm:</strong> Yes but, says Hague, it seems rather a lot of countries are \"better prepared\" than we are to weather the economic downturn. \"The claim [by Brown] to have abolished boom and bust was one of the most foolish, one of the most irresponsible claims ever made by a prime minister,\" says Hague to Tory cheers.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>12:16pm:</strong> Harman urges Hague not to write Britain off or compare it unfavourable to other countries.

Are we going to sit down with greedy energy companies with their huge fat earnings and see what we can do to bring those fuel bills down for ordinary people?</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>12:23pm:</strong> Hoyle is right, says Harman, we do need to take action.

Harman says briefly that the situation of Northern Ireland is \"very much in the government's mind\".</p> <p><strong>Clive Efford</strong> (Lab, Eltham) wants reassurance that helping the \"masters of the universe\" will not be at the expense of frontline public services?

  "<h2>Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics</h2> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/15/unemploymentdata-recession\">UK unemployment is continuing its upward march</a>. September's rise in the claimant count measure of 31,800 was slightly lower than August's rise. But at this rate, the claimant count will still surpass 1m by the end of this year. And the wider ILO measure of unemployment is shooting up much more quickly. The 164,000 rise in the 3 months to August (driven by a sharp drop in employment) pushed the unemployment rate up to 5.7% from 5.2% in the previous quarter. With the UK heading into recession, we expect this measure to rise by a total of 1.5m to around 3m or 9% by the end of 2010,\" she said. </p> <p>\"The threat of a pick-up in pay growth has therefore all but disappeared. Indeed, the 3.4% headline rate of average earnings growth in August was its lowest since 2003. With inflationary pressures outside the labour market now easing markedly too, the way's clear for aggressive interest rate cuts.\"</p> <h2>Howard Archer at Global Insight</h2> <p>\"It seems inevitable that unemployment will rise sharply further over the coming months as near certain recession and depressed business confidence impact. Extended very tight credit conditions would also be liable to lead to firms having to shed jobs. Consequently, claimant count unemployment seems poised to move above 1 million in November and we expect it to climb markedly higher through 2009. Indeed, it could well reach 2 million in 2010. Unemployment on the ILO measure seems certain to rise well above 2 million in 2009,\" Archer said.</p> <h2>Alan Clarke at BNP Paribas</h2> <p>\"The claimant count number may have shown an increase of 32k - not quite as bad as the 35k consensus - but the ILO numbers were simply awful. The ILO measure of unemployment rose by 164k in the last 3 months, that compares to an 81k reported the prior month and is the biggest rise since July 1991,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Employment was equally depressing, with employment falling by 122k in the latest 3 months. That compares to a 16k loss the prior month. </p> <p>\"Earnings growth was more subdued than expected, slowing to 3.4% 3m/yr for the headline (from 3.5) and ex bonus slowing to 3.6% 3m/yr (from 3.7).</p> <p>\"To summarise - these data are grim. Employment is falling off a cliff and it is still early days in this slowdown. Unemployment is rising at a pace not seen since the worst of the early 90s recession.\" </p> <h2>David Kern at the British Chambers of Commerce</h2> <p>\"The worse-than-expected labour market figures highlight the deepening recessionary pressures in the economy. Unemployment is rising, and employment is falling, at their fastest quarterly rates since the early 1990s. Unemployment will rise above the two million mark earlier than we expected. But average earnings growth is falling, confirming that inflationary pressures are easing,\" he said.</p> <p>\"In view of the deteriorating situation, the MPC must now seriously consider a half per cent cut in interest rates at its November meeting. It is also critically important for the Government to announce cuts in business taxation.\"</p> <h2>Lib Dem shadow work and pensions secretary Jenny Willott</h2> <p>\"These figures come as no surprise and are only likely to get worse over the coming months. The effects of the banking crisis have filtered down to the real economy and are affecting people across the county,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Now the banking rescue package has been agreed, the Government must turn its attention to unemployment and inflation. Real families across Britain are suffering, not just those working in the Square Mile. </p> <p>\"As the number of vacancies shrink, it will be harder and harder to get people back into work. It will not simply be a case of retraining the unemployed if there are no jobs for them to return to.\"</p> <h2>Nigel Meager, director of the Institute for Employment Studies</h2> <p>\"Measured unemployment continues to grow, and will keep doing so in the months ahead as the effect of the financial crisis feeds through into the real economy. The labour market responds with a lag to economic changes, however, and it is still too early to say how big the overall impact on employment will be. Developments in the last month mean that an economic recession in the months ahead is almost certain, but its depth and duration are much less certain.<br> \"The labour market has entered this downturn in better shape than it was in previous downturns, and there are still reasons to hope that it may prove more resilient. Since January this year the claimant count increase has averaged 18,000 per month; in the very early stages of the last two recessions it averaged well over 50,000 per month. Reductions in migration and in the numbers of older workers staying on in the labour market may dampen the overall impact on unemployment this time round.\"</p> <h2>CBI's deputy director-general John Cridland</h2> <p>\"These figures are worse than we expected. They suggest the fallout from the slowdown in the economy is being felt by individuals faster and sooner than previously thought. These figures pre-date the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the turbulence which followed, indicating unemployment is likely to rise further through the winter. <br> \"However, changes in the economy since the recessions of the eighties and early nineties should help us avoid the levels of unemployment we saw then.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> today called on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">EU countries</a> to take concerted action to \"root out\" the problems that first caused the economic meltdown in Europe.</p> <p>But he warned that the fight against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climatechange\">climate change</a> was more important than ever as he ruled out relaxing EU targets in the face of the global financial crisis. </p> <p>The premier held a joint press conference with the EU commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, following pre-summit talks on the possible next steps to keep up EU financial coordination and cooperation, while leaving national authorities free to tailor rules to domestic needs.</p> <p>Brown said it was essential that all EU countries felt part of the process necessary to stabilise the system and move the economy of the EU forward. </p> <p>Lauding the leadership of both Barroso and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, over recent days as countries in Europe reeled from the collapse of banks, Brown said that countries had well worked well together on \"stage one\" of dealing with the economic crisis, by stabilising the banking system.</p> <p>The EU now needed move on to what the PM called \"stage two\" \u2013 namely, tackling the underlying fault lines that had caused the crisis in the first place to \"make sure these problems do not recur again\".</p> <p>\"We need to root out the irresponsibilities in the system and introduce new rules to ensure better supervision,\" said Brown. </p> <p>He added: \"To build confidence, which is essential for every investor, every depositor and every business, we have to make sure we deal with the problems in the first place.\"</p> <p>With the economy now a global, rather than merely European or national phenomenon, it was time to overhaul international institutions, and put in place a new \"college\" of supervisors to oversee the financial regulatory system, he said. </p> <p>\"The International Monetary Fund has to be rebuilt and made fit for purpose for the modern world,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We need an early warning system for the modern economy. Instead of having 15 different supervisors meeting separately, we need to have a college of supervisors to deal with these issues.\"</p> <p>He also called for greater transparency across the financial world. </p> <p>But the premier said a focus on tackling the underpinnings of the economy should not be at the expense of the climate change agenda.</p> <p>Citing rising fuel prices, energy security and environmental damage, he added: \"If the last year shows us anything it is that we must deal with climate change problems.\"</p> <p>Flanked by Barroso, he added: \"There are concerns about energy security and about affordability and making us less dependent on a volatile commodity so I believe the climate change agenda is part of the solution to the challenge in the economy that we face today.\"</p> <p>The president of the EU commission said EU leaders needed to remain committed to the 2020 climate change targets.</p> <p>\"I believe it is critically important to keep it,\" said Barroso.</p> <p>Acknowledging the potential \"burden\" to the EU economy if European countries committed to tackling climate change while others did not, he added: \"If we send a signal that we are not committed to doing it it will not encourage others to do it. It would be a complete mistake to say after all this time it is not so urgent.\"</p>",

  "<p>I've always looked to <a href=\"http://www.mahatma.com/\">Mahatma Gandhi</a> as an inspiration, because he embodies the kind of transformational change that can be made when ordinary people come together to do extraordinary things. His values of compassion and understanding as well as determination inspired me in my own struggle and continue to be a source of inspiration for me today.</p> <p>Gandhi inspired a generation to believe in truth, honesty and decency. He gave birth to a global movement of passive resistance and eschewed violence as a means to an end. He inspired giants like Rev Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement in the US. And he inspired <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/blackhistorymonth-nelsonmandela\">Nelson Mandela</a> in his struggle against apartheid. </p> <p>Gandhi wasn't a ruler of nations, nor did he have scientific gifts. Yet this modest man did what others before him couldn't. He led an entire country to freedom and he gave his people hope.</p> <p>The non-violent raid tactic that became a hallmark of Ghandi's resistance against British rule can be traced back to the struggle for home rule in India and the raids on the Dharasana Salt Works \u2013 in protest against a salt tax and the prohibition of private salt making.</p> <p>During the raids, columns of volunteers \u2013 as many as 2,500 at a time \u2013 gathered, walked silently and bravely defied the heavily guarded mines, knowing they would be beaten and perhaps killed. Some had to watch their colleagues collapse and die right before them, as they marched on to face the same dangerous fate. This powerful and moving scene was captured in David Attenborough's 1982 movie, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083987/\">Gandhi</a>. </p> <p>The raids were a perfect example of how non-violent action can undermine ruling powers by dramatising the contrast between steadfast resistance and ruthless repression. As a result of the raids, the British empire's power and credibility in the colonies, and indeed around the world, suffered an irreparable blow. Perhaps more importantly, the raids on Dharasana brought a shining new tactic to the arsenal of non-violent militancy.</p> <p>It's therefore bitterly disappointing that, at the dawn of the 21st century, we don't appear to have learnt these lessons, or heeded the words of one of the greatest humanitarians of our time. </p> <p><em>Kanya King is founder of the Mobo Awards, which take place tonight (Wednesday)</em></p>",
  "<p><strong>10.30am Cannes time -</strong> There are a lot of weary faces around the Palais this morning after the toil of three heavy nights starts to kick in.<br>Last night was one of the biggest party nights here in Cannes, with a number of events going on. BBC Worldwide, together with Impossible Pictures, was promoting ITV1 drama <strong>Primeval</strong>, which it is selling here, with a cocktail party with a number of the cast members. I was told that the show is apparently bigger than CSI in South Korea. Who'd have known. Guests left with a goody bag containing a flying remote control dinosaur which will give EasyJet no end of worries on the journey back I'm sure.</p> <p><strong>Gok Wan</strong> was also in town to promote his new show Miss Naked Beauty at a party hosted by All3Media International and production company Maverick. Guests included Entourage star Adrian Grenier, who was only too happy to pose for pictures with the ladies. </p> <p>For those who witnessed Wan's opening turn at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International TV Festival, you will be pleased to know that he managed to just about keep his potty mouth under control.</p> <p>Today is a broadband focused day here at Mipcom, with the first major event a keynote speech by You Tube founder <strong>Chad Hurley</strong>, who himself looked like he might have had a bit of a late one last night. He announced new partnership deals with Rai in Italy and Aardman in the UK, which will see more animation appear on the platform. The BBC's new director of future media and technology Erik Huggers is due to appear later.</p> <p><strong>10.45am -</strong> Scottish production company The Comedy Unit, part of the RDF Media Group, has released more details of its <strong>Rab C Nesbitt</strong> Christmas special - the first time the Govan philosopher will have been seen on the small screen in a decade.</p> <p>The 45 minute show for BBC2 will reunite the team that made Rab C Nesbitt a hit in the 1990s, with a script penned by Iain Pattison and Gregor Fisher reprising his role as Nesbitt. Elaine C Smith will return as Nesbitt's long-suffering wife Mary Doll while Tony Roper is back as Jamesie Cotter. </p> <p>New faces in the Christmas special include Gary Lewis, who has appeared in Billy Elliot and Gangs of New York, as Mary's old boyfriend Frank and Kathleen McDermott, whose credits include Wedding Belles, as Gash's new wife Lorna. </p> <p>\"For those waiting to find out what has been happening to the string-vested, armchair philosopher since he was last seen on the small screen, there'll be more than a few surprises in store as Rab's return will see him finding religion, sobriety, and even the cooker,\" a spokeswoman promises.</p> <p><strong>4.30pm -</strong> <strong>Erik Huggers</strong> was interviewed in a session at Mipcom today but didn't say much more than Guardian readers already know, following his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/13/bbc-microsoft\">interview with the media section on Monday</a>.</p> <p>He confirmed that a children's version of the iPlayer was in development and would launch soon, potentially before the end of the year. He also talked more about bringing the iPlayer to television sets through Freeview and said he wanted to see an open standard developed that could see other services get in on the act as well. However, he warned that road ahead on this one could be a long one with costs not even in the equation yet and permission still needed from the BBC Trust. \"There is a lot of technology that needs to come to bear to make this work in an open environment,\" he said.\"My best guess is that it is a year to a year and a half away if everything is approved.\"</p>",
