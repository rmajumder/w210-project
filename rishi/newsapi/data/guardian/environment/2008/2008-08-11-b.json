  "<p>With get-in and get-out times at a premium, it is rare to come across an Edinburgh show with a serious design, let alone a company that tries to use space with real imagination. So all power to director and designer Dan Marsden, who demonstrates real flair and ambition with this piece exploring the relationship between the women who work in lap-dancing clubs and their punters. From the moment you set off up the seedy red-lit staircase to the room above, nothing is quite what it seems in this promenade performance. Just as the women who wriggle around the poles or strut along the walkway are selling illusions, so is this show.</p> <p>There are moments when you cannot quite believe your eyes because it seems as if the walls have moved. The technique of disorientating the audience and creating an immersive environment is one that will be familiar to anyone who has seen a Punchdrunk show. Marsden and co-director, Rose Lewenstein, handle this aspect with real aplomb. What is lacking is the content to match the aesthetic. The show makes its points quickly and then merely repeats them. It never quite negotiates the thin line between critiqueing the gentlemen and strippers of the title and actually making them seem quite sexy.</p> <p>The writing's lack of muscle is scarcely camouflaged by the show's multimedia overkill: a live DJ, choreographed sequences and film, as well as a last-minute and totally spurious nod towards circus skills. It is a pity because this is an ambitious and in many ways a very confident work, which not only creates a complete world, but is also worlds away from the typical Edinburgh black-box show.</p>",
  "<p>It is only mid-afternoon in Sana'a's picturesque old city, a maze of tall gingerbread houses, braying animals and colourful markets. But is is strangely quiet as shopkeepers lounge behind their wares, many of them chewing away furiously at a green wad the size of a golfball. Drivers with bulging cheeks negotiate the narrow streets picking at plastic bags of leaves, sipping water to combat dehydration or sweet fizzy drinks to take away the bitter taste of qat \u2014 a national pastime and part of the landscape of this beautiful country.</p> <p>But as consumption increases and the effects of the global food crisis kick in, attention is starting to focus on the huge damage this habit is doing to a desperately poor people with limited resources of land and water. Seventy percent of all households report at least one user; one in seven of the workforce is involved in production, transport or sale. Qat makes up a third of all Yemeni agriculture. </p> <p>\"I spend 1,000 riyals every a day on qat, and I earn about 4,000,\" says Hamid from Ta'iz, Yemen's second city. Amin, a journalist, admits to chewing every day. Others indulge only a couple of times a week. But government ministers, officials and businessmen often chew as much as the simplest people. Qat chews can take place on a grimy pavement or in a smart diwan equipped with comfortable cushions and water-pipes. \"It helps me relax,\" explains one habitual user. \"It's like having a couple of beers,\" says another.</p> <p>Qat is an amphetamine-like stimulant that is banned or restricted by many other countries. Users say chewing the leaves of this spindly shrub encourages conversation and sociability, though this wanes at \"Solomon's hour\", a time of introspection often accompanied by the playing of the oud. A session might last for three or four hours, after which chewers spit out their wads of qat mulch and go home. Users can become psychologically dependent but it is not considered addictive.</p> <p>Fares Sanabani, editor of Yemen Today magazine and an aide to President Ali Abdullah Salih, always has a story to tell or something to contribute when he goes to a chew. \"I'm sad that it's there but I enjoy the culture,\" he admits. \"We have chews where we listen to music or talk politics. But I don't want my staff to chew. I don't want them to waste their money, especially if they don't have very much.\"</p> <p>Until the 1960s qat chewing was an occasional pastime for the elite. But it is now deeply engrained, a product, ironically, of the rapid growth of wealth in the 1970s and 1980s. Abdel-Karim al-Iryani, a former prime minister, now holds qat chews very infrequently. But the minister of religious affairs offered me the choicest leaves when I went to see him at his Sana'a home recently. The Quran and the hadith do not offer unequivocal guidance.</p> <p>Social pressure is the main reason so many Yemenis chew. \"The decision not to use qat is not equivalent to the decision to decline drinks at a dinner party,\" wrote Branko Milanovic, who studied the phenomenon for the World Bank. \"It is much more important because it excludes the person from social contacts that are necessary for his business or private life.\" If corruption is the country's political glue, commented another foreign student of Yemen, qat is its \"social glue\".</p> <p>Tim Mackintosh-Smith, a British writer and veteran resident of Sana'a, dismisses as \"quasi-scientific poppycock\" the suggestion that chewers are \"at best profligates, at worst irretrievable sinners\". The so-called \"curse of Yemen\" has certainly not impaired his ability to write with huge empathy and erudition about this remote and extraordinary corner of south Arabia. The leaf, he insists, helps users to \"think, work, and study\". </p> <p>To some, qat makes sense economically. Like poppies in Afghanistan, qat is a high-value and resilient crop that regularly produces good returns for growers. But the result is that it has taken over the most productive arable land and displaced food crops that used to be grown for local consumption or for export (including the legendary Mocha coffee), boosting dependence on imported staples. The price of wheat has doubled or more in recent months.</p> <p>Another downside is that qat cultivation consumes a staggering 20% of Yemen's already scarce water\u2014 cheap to pump with subidised diesel fuel. Government ministers say openly that reducing fuel subsidies would be the most effective way to discourage qat growing.</p> <p>And the health risks are indisputable: the use of fertilisers and pesticides to increase crop yields can cause cancers of the mouth and digestive system. Qat is also an appetite suppressant. For poor families \u2014 in a country where half the population (growing at one of the fastest rates in the world) lives on less than $2 per day \u2014 spending on qat means less to spend on food. The World Bank says its consumption requires about 10% of the household budget for all income groups. Malnutrition is already rife and famine is now seen as a real danger.</p> <p>\"It's got to the stage where foreign donors say the government needs to choose between qat and food,\" warns Khaled al-Mulad, director of the Yemen branch of the Islamic Relief charity.</p> <p>Some say the taboo on talking about qat has been broken, though official attempts to discourage its use have met little success. Several NGOs are now trying. No-one believes an outright ban could work \u2014 if only because chewing is not harmful enough. Parents of children at one Sana'a school complained when their offspring came home to tell them qat was a bad thing: the education programme was shut down.</p> <p>Qat is banned in the security forces but it is common to see police and soldiers chewing, even, disconcertingly, when on guard duty. Hotels and companies catering to foreigners have enforced a ban on pain of fines or dismissal. Even President Salih announced that he was reducing his consumption. One American diplomat faced a terrible ordeal when he had to go on local TV to explain that qat users would not be granted immigrant visas to the US because the leaf was classified as a drug.</p> <p>For Abdel-Rahman al-Eryani, Yemen's minister of water and the environment, this year's food crisis has come as a wake-up call, though he fears it may already be too late. \"Qat is a drug, even if every Yemeni will fight you if you say that. It has all the symptoms. It's a cash crop that is part of a vicious cycle of internal bleeding. People in this country are simply chewing their way to oblivion.\"</p>",
  "<p>It came as no surprise to Dick Hobbs, professor of sociology at the London School of Economics, when he made Patsy Kensit cry. An expert on violence and organised crime, he had been asked to contribute to an edition of the BBC programme \"Who do You Think You Are?\", due to be broadcast tomorrow, in which the actress explores her family background. (Last night, he appeared on BBC4's The Real Life on Mars, arguing that 70s cops really were as bad as depicted in the John Simm TV series.)</p> <p>\"All I knew about Patsy Kensit's dad was that he was a grass,\" says Hobbs. After some research, including talking to former London gang members \"Mad\" Frankie Fraser and Eddie Richardson, he knew more, but none of it was likely to please Kensit. The extent of Jimmy \"The Dip\" Kensit's involvement in crime was shocking, says Hobbs. Not only was he a well-known pickpocket and close associate of the Krays - indeed he made Reggie Kray his son's godfather - but he had also been arrested a couple of times simply for being \"an incorrigible rogue\". Then there was the fact that he'd given evidence against the Richardson brothers in order to get himself out of prison.</p> <p>Being a grass isn't quite as big a deal as people like to think, says Hobbs. He claims the idea that some kind of moral code exists among villains, which means they don't inform on each other, is a myth. In fact, many of the big organised crime cases, from the Brinks Mat gold heist to the activities of the Kray twins, were solved because people were willing to inform. Everyone knew Jimmy Kensit had snitched, but he didn't suffer any consequences. </p> <p><strong>The night-time economy</strong></p> <p>Underlying much of Hobbs's work, which has examined gun crime, bouncers, drug trafficking and the night-time economy, is the view that villainy is not necessarily that big a deal either. Just as villains' approach to informing on their mates has often been based more on practicality than morality, so has their approach to crime. \"I want to get away from the idea that crime is an extraordinary activity,\" he says. \"It is normal, and a part of everyday life.\"</p> <p>This is a view formed after a childhood spent in the East End of London, and an academic career dedicated to talking to others about their lives in a big city. Few of us can say we have taken no part in the criminal marketplace, whether buying cheap drink or a knocked-off DVD, he claims, and for most city dwellers, crime is something they take for granted, which they negotiate as victims, perpetrators, and often as both. It comes some way down their list of concerns, below educating their children and keeping their jobs. Where it does worry them, it is usually in terms of vandalism or noise rather than drug-running or guns. And for a significant minority it can offer meaning, status and money in their pockets.</p> <p>\"If you are a victim of crime it is a terrible thing,\" says Hobbs. \"But crime can be quite life enhancing for people. It gives them a buzz. A little bit of the day is theirs. If they have a mundane job and have nicked something from work or taken a packet of drugs, it gives them the feeling they have some control over their lives. They enjoy it; otherwise, they wouldn't do it.\"</p> <p>This is not to say the nature of crime and violence has remained constant. When he began his research 20 years ago, anyone carrying a gun was a specialist. \"He was known as a shooter, and these weren't random acts,\" he says. \"It was someone who would use weapons as part of their job.\" If guns were used in a vendetta, it demonstrated a major step up - a step across the line - whereas now, he says, guns are more likely to be used simply because there are more of them around. The kind of violent feuds once associated only with professional criminals now seem to be taking place between children, he says - something he blames not only on the greater availability of weapons, but on a youth culture, which, dominated by consumerism and by the US, encourages young people to carry them.</p> <p>But, according to Hobbs, what has really transformed the nature of crime since he began studying it is the dominance of drugs and the instant and enormous fortunes they offer. Drugs, he says, have taken away any notion of criminal specialisation. \"Anyone can have a whip-round, take a cheap flight to Amsterdam and become an international drugs smuggler. Hijacking a lorry, robbing a bank, breaking a safe, or whatever, is impossible because of the levels of knowledge you'd need. Now, it's a complete and utter free for all. It's very democratic.\"</p> <p>Where once villains needed to come from the right criminal family and to serve an apprenticeship of several years to learn their safe-breaking or bank-robbing craft, the underworld has become more diffuse, fluid and multicultural, he says. While criminals have always had a streak of entrepreneurialism, crime itself has now gone from a craft to an international business. And just as city analysts seem to take in their stride the risk of getting things wrong, so the smugglers make realistic assessments about the risks of getting caught - which, on the whole, are not that high.</p> <p>Hobbs has just completed a piece of work for the Home Office in which he interviewed 230 drug smugglers in jail. One of the things he found was that prison wasn't much of a deterrent; they accepted the possibility of going to jail as part of the game. The thing that really worried them was having their assets taken away. \"The idea of coming out having spent 10 to 12 years inside - having no car, no money, family gone, back to the bare bones. That seemed to worry them far more.\"</p> <p><strong>Messenger boy</strong></p> <p>The business side of crime has always interested Hobbs, although he's never been anywhere near business himself. The son of a warehouseman and dressmaker, he left school at 17 with two O-levels and started work as a messenger boy for a publishing company, based in the building directly opposite his current office at the LSE. This was in 1968, and he says he used to watch the students preparing for global revolution while he was busy running errands.</p> <p>After getting further qualifications at night school, between clerical and manual jobs, including working as a dustman and roadsweeper, he taught in London primary schools, before taking a masters in sociology at the LSE, where he discovered a fascination for the sociology of crime. This was followed by a PhD at Surrey on the entrepreneurial nature of criminals and police officers in the East End, a study that became a prize-winning book Doing Business. It examined wheeling and dealing in the East End - minor fiddles carried out in warehouses, dodgy early morning deals before a van driver started his day job, CID information trades with villains. \"Some of it was legal and some wasn't and, in the end, it didn't matter what was and what wasn't,\" he says.</p> <p>The same attitude informs his drug-smuggler research. Carried out in collaboration with economists, it looks at drug dealing as an economic activity, studying questions involving pricing and transport, \"trying to break away from all the moral outrage that accompanies so much writing about drugs\".</p> <p>It is not the first time that Hobbs has been consulted by the government, although he is cynical about how much it will listen. As a professor at Durham University in the late 1990s, he carried out an extensive piece of research on alcohol and the night-time economy, which included a couple of his research colleagues working as bouncers. Like many experts, he advised that 24-hour pub opening would not solve Britain's alcohol problems. \"All the civil servants and MPs we spoke to agreed with us, but they went ahead anyway,\" he says. \"I think it's for economic reasons. We are so reliant now on pubs and clubs in city centres that if you take that away, what's going to be there?\"</p> <p>Many of the villains who have been Hobbs's contacts over the years have themselves fallen victim to drink, often bewildered by the changes that have taken place in their world over the past couple of decades - the loss of those armed robber fraternities in which, even if the rules were regularly broken, at least they were rules they understood. But in this nostalgia for their heyday, they differ little from their pensioner contemporaries in the legitimate world, says Hobbs.</p> <p>He also hesitates to say that the younger generation is any more prone to violence than it ever was. When he was growing up, a friend bled to death after being struck with a glass in a pub known as the Stabbers Arms because of the number of stabbings that took place. \"Violence was part of our lives and you became quite savvy about dealing with it,\" he says. </p> <p>Yet he concedes that \"there are certain communities that are undoubtedly racked with fear concerning children killing children\", and that in these places the issue of escalating violence is a real one. \"We need to be very very careful about how we approach it,\" he says. \"A lot of the media approach to both gun and knife crime has been surreptitiously racist.\" While the first reaction when a young person is killed is to relate it to gangs, often it has been the result some other kind of feud - to do with family or jealousy, he says. \"That's what we need to be careful about, because the whole gang thing has been turning it into a racist conversation rather than a conversation about changes in youth and changes in the way youth view the world.\"</p> <p>Personally, he feels in little danger because he no longer lives in the communities where violence is happening. Nevertheless, displaying some of Patsy Kensit's feeling for family, he admits he still doesn't sleep until his two sons, both \"huge\" and in their early 20s, are safely home in bed.</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>57</p> <p><strong>Job </strong>Professor of sociology, LSE</p> <p><strong>Books</strong> Doing the Business (Oxford) 1988.

  "<p>He dropped out of the sky and left, an hour or so later, the same way, helicopter rotor blades driving a gritty dust storm from the dirt playing field into the faces of hundreds of Ethiopian hill villagers. They waved and clapped and shook the hand of a white-haired man who used to hold the most powerful office on the planet and who has just failed to help his wife secure it in her turn. Yet the people of Rema had no idea who William Jefferson Clinton was or what he was doing in their village.</p> <p>One man knew the name, though his wife looked blank. \"Clinton,\" said Awke Tiruneh, whose hut the president had been due to visit but didn't, because of the tight schedule powerful men run to. \"He is from Germany.\" It is the only foreign country Tiruneh has heard of, because a German NGO is based on Rema's doorstep, but he has not a clue where either Germany or America are. The outside world is the village on top of the next hill, a long, rocky walk down one mountain and up another.</p> <p>Yet Clinton came to put Rema on the map, hailing it as a model for the developing world and a place that could teach the US a thing or two. Rema, in the northern highlands, is now the first solar-powered village in Ethiopia - a cluster of 1,100 homes that shine in the dark evenings like white beads on a string. Every home has electric light from an energy-efficient LED bulb hanging from the straw ceiling. Children can do schoolwork after 6pm while women weave the gabi - a white cotton head-to-toe wrap that is worn in church and in the evenings to keep out the cold (now Clinton has one too). Night classes have started in the school for adults who want to learn to read, there is a solar-powered fridge at the health centre that cannot run out of fuel, and women no longer have to walk a mile to the well, thanks to a solar-powered pump. High-quality equipment has been installed that will last for 25 or 30 years. Villagers pay around 80p a month to cover the cost of maintenance and new batteries.</p> <p>Rema has become a model for the future energy needs of developing countries, Clinton believes. Solar power could be a revolution for Africa. \"It's the energy equivalent of the cellphone movement,\" he says.</p> <p>Bill is not the only Clinton whose imagination has been caught by this project. His 28-year-old daughter Chelsea is there too, as are Clinton's brother Roger and 14-year-old nephew Tyler. Chelsea took indefinite unpaid leave from her management consultancy job to help her mother's unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination. \"She wasn't back at a new task yet so she wanted to come with me, and I love it,\" her father tells me later in the presidential suite at the Addis Ababa Sheraton, whose marbled elegance and air conditioning would make a Rema villager's eyes pop. \"We like to travel together.\"</p> <p>The shade of Hillary's momentous campaign travels with them. Clinton speaks of it with a sort of warm afterglow, in spite of the panning he personally received. \"I'm immensely proud of Hillary,\" he says. \"Her performance in March, April and May, to June 3, was literally miraculous. If you'd told me, given the facts that existed on March 1, that she'd come back, win more popular votes, do as well as she did, I would never have believed it ... I thought she learned, she grew and I think by the end she was running like a house on fire.</p> <p>\"I'm very grateful actually, personally, that I had a chance to get out and see so much of America, because her only option after she lost all those caucuses in February and knew she was going to be outspent was to raise this incredible grassroots campaign. And Chelsea made 450 appearances for her mother. In the last three months alone I went to 350 different communities. I got to see parts of America I never saw when I was running or serving, and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.\"</p> <p>Now, however, he is on a whistle-stop tour of his charitable foundation's projects in Africa: today Ethiopia, tomorrow Rwanda, the next day in and out of Liberia and on to Senegal. Much of it is to do with health - Clinton's influence, his ability to flatter, charm and persuade, has had great success in negotiating down drug prices for Aids and malaria for the developing world. He is pushing to increase dramatically the numbers of women with HIV given drugs in pregnancy to stop their babies becoming infected. But here in the northern highlands of Ethiopia, we are looking at ways to mitigate the effects of climate change.</p> <p>\"My whole theory about climate change is that the biggest problem in aggregate is the fact that India and China are about to pass the US in emissions and no country is going to agree to remain poor in order to avert climate change. We have to be able to show that there are economically viable options.</p> <p>\"I think it is really important that the vast mass of countries that are developing find ways to skip the carbon stage of economic development - ways that accelerate rather than undermine their wellbeing.\"</p> <p>Shouldn't the US take steps to reduce its own emissions before it starts visiting its ideas on Africa? \"I think that the United States does need to pass climate change legislation, we need to put a price on carbon, we need to set up a capping trade system and one that can't be cheated on: I agree with all that. But when people say that most loudly, they are usually looking for an excuse to do nothing, and if we burn up the planet then no one will give you laurels for having come up with the best available excuse to do nothing. Your grandchildren won't be proud of you. And we may have an irreversible situation,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Secondly, because all these developing countries have to be worried about the problems at hand, feeding the people that are there, educating them, providing basic healthcare, having some near-term economic strategy, I think that people like me who care about this stuff have to find economically attractive options for them.\"</p> <p>Environmentally friendly energy policies can go hand in hand with economic growth, he says. It's happened in the UK and Denmark, he says, two of only six countries - excluding \"some former communist countries that, prior to 1990, were running very, very dirty carbon-based inefficient industrial economies\" - that have been on course to meet their Kyoto target.</p> <p>\"The biggest problem with Kyoto was the United States bugged out on it, so it gave everybody an excuse to take a bath,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I'm not a government and I don't have access to vast amounts of money, and I'm frustrated that even when the Democrats are in, we still haven't given a tax credit, for example, for wind energy that goes more than three years. Nonetheless, somebody needs to go out there and help people figure out how to do this stuff. That's what I do. </p> <p>\"I just try to figure it out and I try to get other smart people around who figure out how to do this, because I was so struck by all these countries that won't meet their Kyoto targets. Most of them were not led by people who were dishonest when they signed Kyoto. They aren't lazy, they aren't stupid and they aren't corrupt. They're well-meaning, hard-working people who are, like all political leaders, facing all kinds of competing pressures in an economy that is not organised for tomorrow's energy - it's organised for yesterday's.</p> <p>\"One reason I went to that little village today is that that little village is now organised for tomorrow. I'll go home now and I'll be able to tell people that I went to the highlands of Ethiopia and saw a classroom with two LED lights - nobody will believe that - and that it works economically for them.\"</p> <p>The man who brought light to Rema was neither a former president nor a technology geek. Harald Sch\u00fctzeichel studied music and theology, he tells me. He started the Solar Energy Foundation because he wanted to help development. If there are environmental benefits, so much the better. He was completely astonished when he got an email saying Clinton wanted to visit. He is still not quite sure why, but he knows that the boss of Good Energies, the company that has donated 80% of his funding, is a friend of the former president.</p> <p>What Sch\u00fctzeichel does not realise is that Marcel Brenninkmeijer, founder and CEO of Good Energies, who also jumps out of the Clinton helicopter, is shelling out cash - it took \u00a3240,000 to equip Rema - because he is part of the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). It is a kind of networking with good deeds attached. Clinton brings together wealthy businessmen and government leaders for an annual jamboree and they promise action on global problems, not just talk. If they fail to carry out their promises, they don't get invited again.</p> <p>Sch\u00fctzeichel, though, is innocent of the politics of global philanthropy. Clinton invites him to give a presentation to the next meeting in September. Afterwards, Sch\u00fctzeichel confesses he has no idea what the CGI is. He wants help to expand his solar-powered villages across Ethiopia by setting up a microfinance bank that will allow villagers to borrow money for solar power installation and pay it off at a rate they can afford. \"I need \u20ac10m [\u00a37.8m],\" he says, barely appreciating that he has just been handed his best-ever opportunity of getting it.</p> <p>Rema had its installation for free, to show what could be done. Down the hill from the village, Sch\u00fctzeichel has built an International Solar Energy School, which has trained 24 technicians from all over Ethiopia. The plan is for them to return to their regions and set up their own businesses, equipping more villages, which will borrow the necessary funds from Sch\u00fctzeichel's microfinance bank.</p> <p>We're thousands of miles away from the US, but not from its politics. Some of the foundation staff worked for Hillary's nomination and they talk of it as something momentous, with a sort of awe-struck sadness that they were part of it and she lost. \"I just want very much the country to change course,\" says Clinton. \"I want us to be on a different economic course, a different social policy course, a different course in the world. And we're going to do what we can to be helpful.\"</p> <p>What about criticisms of his role in Hillary's campaign? \"It's all part of the deal,\" he says, laughing. \"Look, what we were doing was working, so you had to assume there was going to be some blow-back. It's a contact sport, politics ... I would never have gotten back into politics if it hadn't been for Hillary, but I felt so strongly that she should be elected and she needed all of us - she needed Chelsea and she needed me. Our bodies made up for the financial disparity a little bit. And so we threw ourselves into the fray and did our best and you just get up and go on.</p> <p>\"And I'm immensely proud of her, but I think she's the political leader of our family now - I'm not in politics. And I'm going to do exactly what she says we should do and agree with her decision. I think she's been big and positive and that's what we should all be.\"</p> <p>And so he and Chelsea are in Africa to change the world in other ways. Rema's name will be spoken of in high circles, as a byword for environmentally friendly development. More visitors may descend from the skies. A solar-powered cinema is mooted, where films on development will be shown, so that Rema's people will understand what they can aspire to.</p> <p>Awke Tiruneh and his wife Emaye Beyene are not the only couple who are faintly bemused. They are pleased with their two lightbulbs, one in the main room and a second in the kitchen annexe of their pristine mud hut, and with the radio that everybody in Rema tunes to get music, not news. But they say they don't want anything else. </p> <p>\"When they have more money, they don't know what to do with it in Rema,\" says Samson Tsegaye, country director of the Solar Power Foundation. \"They are happy. They don't need a Mercedes or a television. When they have money, the men are always going to the bar. </p> <p>The solar cinema is to show them what money can do - how opportunity can come to their lives. They have three meals a day but they don't know what is going on in the world.\"</p> <p>Are Bill and Hillary Clinton, who have been at the centre of what is going on in the world, happier than the villagers of Rema? It's an interesting question.</p>",
  "<p>Sales of homes by Britain's estate agents are down 40% on a year ago as the strict lending conditions imposed by the credit crunch prevent first-time buyers securing a mortgage, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says today. </p> <p>In its monthly health check of the property market, the body that represents estate agents said it expected prices to continue falling but that its members were hopeful of a pick-up in business.</p> <p>The RICS said it could detect some signs that the market was close to a floor, with new buyer inquiries and sales expectations higher and a small fall in the balance of surveyors reporting price falls. But with one estate agent saying that the first-time buyer was \"on the endangered list\", the RICS confirmed that the market was being affected by the financial market turmoil of the past year.</p> <p>\"Tighter credit conditions, in terms of both collateral requirements and generally wider lending margins, is impairing housing market activity,\" it said.</p> <p>Sales per surveyor stood at 14.4 in the three months to July, it said, down from 15.3 in the quarter ending in June. The balance of estate agents recording a fall in prices over the three months was a \"very negative\" 83.9%, but down from 86.9% in June and a peak of 94.7% in April.</p> <p>In addition to the headline price balance, the RICS said new buyer inquiries and newly agreed sales series improved for the third successive month. \"This might possibly reflect the more realistic pricing environment,\" it said.</p> <p>\"In terms of the outlook, the July survey lends further support to the notion that activity may be beginning to stabilise, albeit at a low level.\" </p> <p>Surveyors questioned by RICS were downbeat about the outlook, although in some parts of the country agents said they saw signs of an improved climate. \"It has been an encouraging month for sales - 25% up on June and just 20% down on July 2007,\" said James Buxton of Bidwells in Cambridge, who noted that a seven-bedroom house had sold for about \u00a33.5m - a record for the city.</p> <p>Quentin Jackson-Stops, of Jackson Stops and Staff in Northampton, said: \"Conditions are more difficult even than the 1990s because of a lack of first-time buyers entering the market due to a lack of available mortgage funding.\"</p> <p>Another surveyor, Malcolm Parker, of Joplings in North Yorkshire, said: \"The only properties attracting any interest are those offered at greatly discounted prices (ie repossessions, new builds on large developments) and the older rural properties. The first-time buyer is on the list of endangered species.\"</p> <p>A separate report today from the British Retail Consortium finds that the weakness of the property market was affecting demand for household goods and furnishings, helping to contribute to another poor month for business in the high street.</p> <p>The BRC said poor weather and belt-tightening by consumers had meant annual like-for-like sales were down in July for the fourth time in five months - retailing's worst run since 2005. The BRC's director-general, Stephen Robertson, said \"frivolous shopping is off the agenda\", adding that customers were concentrating on \"value and durability\". There was little sign of the slowdown in retailing bottoming out, Robertson said.</p> <p>Supermarkets were the only sector of the high street to report significant growth on July 2007, but the BRC said sales of furniture and furnishings were well below their levels of a year earlier for a sixth consecutive month. \"With no let-up in the housing market slowdown and the squeeze on incomes, forward orders pointed to further slowdown,\" the report said.</p> <p>With increasing demands on household budgets, the BRC said shoppers were reluctant to spend on non-necessities, and were now including clothes in this category. \"With shoppers increasingly cautious in spending tight budgets - and now often seeing clothes as more of a discretionary purchase - core basics, childrenswear and clearance bargains sold well.\"</p> <p>The survey found that retailers had responded with aggressive price cuts in the summer sales, but business remained difficult. \"Even heavy discounting often failed to tempt customers to buy,\" the BRC said.</p> <p>Total sales in July were 1.7% higher than in the same month a year ago, but the BRC said like-for-like sales were down 0.9%.</p>",
  "<p>Kazakhmys, the world's 10th-biggest copper producer, yesterday moved to ensure that none of its rivals can snap up fellow Kazakh miner Eurasian Natural Resources Corp (ENRC) by increasing its stake in the world's biggest producer of ferrochrome.</p> <p>Kazakhmys said it has no plans to mount a takeover of ENRC, but the move, taking its stake to 25%, will increase speculation that the two firms could combine with Russian group Metalloinvest to create a major force in international mining.</p> <p>News that Kazakhmys had bought a further 35.7m ENRC shares - at an average price of \u00a311.26 to take its holding to 322m - came as commodity prices continued to fall yesterday.</p> <p>Growing concerns about decreasing demand from the US as well as emerging markets such as China saw the price of copper fall to a six-month low yesterday.</p> <p>Prices of other metals used extensively in industry, such as zinc and nickel, also declined as traders predicted that the commodity boom has come to an end as the global economy slows down. Speculators were also said to be moving their focus from commodities to the dollar, which strengthened again yesterday after its biggest one-day rise against the euro for almost eight years on Friday.</p> <p>Gold also fell, having seen its price drop more than $50 an ounce last week, as the dollar continued to rise. The precious metal, which was trading at around $850 an ounce yesterday, is used as a hedge against the dollar and typically moves in the opposite direction to the currency.</p> <p>The recent downturn in what has been a prolonged boom in commodity prices has seen merger activity among the mining companies. Last week Xstrata mounted an audacious $10bn (\u00a35bn) hostile bid for Lonmin, the London-based mining company created out of Lonrho in 1998.</p> <p>Lonmin, a platinum specialist, saw its share price soar almost 50% after Xstrata snapped up a 10.68% stake in the business and launched a \u00a333-a-share offer for the whole company.</p> <p>Lonmin rejected the bid as \"opportunistic and entirely unwelcome\" and over the weekend each company accused the other of engaging in dirty tricks to try to gain shareholder support for their positions.</p> <p>Last month Kazakhmys said it was holding merger talks with an unnamed company, widely believed to have been Metalloinvest, founded by Uzbek billionaire Alisher Usmanov. Kazakhmys's move on ENRC is seen by some in the City as the precursor to a three-way tie-up.</p>",
  "<p>There was one positive to emerge from Manchester City amid the turmoil surrounding the club's financial future yesterday when Mark Hughes confirmed he had prevented the popular defender, Vedran Corluka, from completing an \u00a38m move to Tottenham Hotspur. That City's new and increasingly frustrated manager was compelled to act at all, however, indicates how Thaksin Shinawatra's legal and political problems have radically altered the ambition that enticed Hughes from Blackburn Rovers 10 weeks ago.</p> <p>A spokesman for City last night denied claims that Corluka and Stephen Ireland had been offered for sale without the manager's knowledge and that the owner's decision to seek exile in the UK, and leave an estimated \u00a3800m in assets frozen in Thailand, had thrown the day-to-day running of the club into chaos. \"That is categorically untrue,\" he said.</p> <p>City claim that Corluka came close to joining Spurs - so close that the Croatian international passed a medical on Friday and is believed to have agreed personal terms over the weekend - only because of the attractive offer on the table from White Hart Lane and not because the club needed the money. </p> <p>Likewise Ireland, who was out shopping on Saturday afternoon when he received a call telling him to report for City's pre-season friendly defeat of Milan, was absent because of a miscommunication and not after being informed that Sunderland and Bolton were interested in his \u00a36m services. City's case in that respect was strengthened yesterday when Sunderland denied being in pursuit of the Republic of Ireland midfielder.</p> <p>Accepting a potential \u00a31m profit on Corluka, however, as the City hierarchy did last week, does not tally with the ambitions of a club that is supposed to be competing for European qualification under Hughes this season. Nor does it dispel the argument that, having pledged almost \u00a370m on transfer fees alone since purchasing the club for \u00a380m last summer and sought new investment in the club, It could be that Thaksin is struggling to pay the latest instalments on players signed by Sven-Goran Eriksson - frozen assets and the heat from the Thai Supreme Court being the principal reasons why.</p> <p>The deposed former Thai prime minister spent \u00a321.6m to buy City's shares last summer and a loan of \u00a319.2m previously owed to the former owners John Wardle and David Makin is now owed to Thaksin's company, UK Sports Investments Ltd. </p> <p>Of the 10 headline signings made since his arrival, only the recent \u00a35m acquisition of Tal Ben Haim involved money paid to an English club, in this instance Chelsea, with the remaining nine, including the the \u00a38m Elano, the \u00a319m Brazilian striker Jo and the \u00a38.8m Italian forward Rolando Bianchi, payable in several instalments. The second instalments on those deals are now due while loan fees for Nery Castillo, wages, severance pay for Eriksson and compensation to Blackburn for Hughes have also added to the costs for City and their owner.</p> <p>Doubts over Thaksin's ability to realise his goal of taking City into the Champions League hardened last week when it was confirmed he had appointed an intermediary to hold \"exploratory discussions\" with several potential investors, believed to be based in the Middle East and India, who can also help promote the club as a global brand. </p> <p>Yesterday the club reiterated that City were not up for sale, only seeking new partners, but should \u00a3800m remain frozen in Thailand, then a saleable Premier League outfit would represent an obvious way for Thaksin to recoup his losses.</p> <p>The impact for Hughes appears more immediate. City officials claim to be trying to add to the manager's squad, not detracting from it, despite accepting an offer for a defender - Corluka - who Hughes had made clear was an integral part of his future plans. The City manager talked the Croatian out of the move to London on Sunday afternoon but only, it is believed, after blocking the sale and insisting on the terms of a contract that gives him control over transfer policy.</p> <p>\"I am a huge admirer of Vedran. He is a top-class player with a bright future ahead of him and I am delighted that he continues to be a part of our plans at City,\" the manager said. \"It is a real boost for everyone at the club.\" Maybe not all.</p> <h2><strong>Thaksin's transfers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Ins</strong><br><strong>2007</strong><br>Bianchi (Reggina) \u00a38.8m<br>Fernandes (FC Sion) Undisc<br>Geovanni (Cruzeiro) Free<br>Petrov (A Madrid) \u00a34.7m; <br>Garrido (Sociedad) \u00a31.5m<br>Corluka (D Zagreb) \u00a37m<br>Blumer (Shakhtar Donetsk) \u00a38m<br>Bojinov (Fiorentina) \u00a36.6m</p> <p><strong>2008</strong><br>Caicedo (Basle) \u00a35.2m<br>Benjani (Portsmouth) \u00a33.9m<br>Jo (CSKA Moscow) \u00a318m<br>Ben Haim (Chelsea) \u00a35m<br><strong>Total \u00a368.7m</strong></p> <p><strong>Outs</strong><br><strong>2007</strong><br>Sinclair Released <br>Jordan Released <br>Trabelsi Released <br>D'Laryea Released <br>Matthewson Released <br>Williams Released <br>Distin (Portsmouth) Free<br>Barton Newcastle \u00a35.8m<br>Weaver (Charlton) Free</p> <p><strong>2008</strong><br>Laird (Millwall) Undisclosed<br>Dabo (Lazio) Undisclosed<br>Miller (West Bromwich) \u00a30.9m<br>Dickov Released <br>Geovanni (Hull) Free<br>Mpenza Released <br>Sun Jihai (Sheffield Utd) Free<br>Isaksson (PSV Eindhoven) Undisclosed <br>Samaras (Celtic) \u00a32m<br>Corradi (Reggina) Free<br>Mills (Doncaster) \u00a3300,000m <br><strong>Total \u00a39m</strong></p>",
  "<p>Arthur Scargill is a brave man. He was brave to come to the climate camp at Kingsnorth last week. Though we disagreed with most of what he said, he earned our respect for his willingness to debate. He is brave to return to public life after suffering one of the nastiest vilification campaigns in British history, and is brave to be fighting for coal again. He is especially brave to offer to asphyxiate himself in the interests of science. Many people would be willing to help him perform this experiment at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>But he is also wrong. In his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/08/nuclearpower.fossilfuels\">article</a> last week demanding a return to coal and accusing me of selling out, Scargill suggested that radioactive discharges are more dangerous than carbon emissions. This, of course, is nonsense; but if he really believes it he should be campaigning against the burning of coal. </p> <p>The odd and widely ignored truth is that routine radioactive discharges from coal-burning are greater than those produced by nuclear plants. Coal contains trace amounts of uranium and thorium. Though these are present at much lower levels than in nuclear fuel, a lot more coal is burned, which means that total emissions are greater. An article in Scientific American last year maintained that levels of ionising radiation in the bones of people living around coal plants are up to six times higher than the levels in people living around atomic power stations. </p> <p>The people most at risk from the radioactivity associated with coal (not to mention far greater hazards such as dust, heavy metals and sulphur and nitrous oxide pollution) are the workers - both in the mines and in the power plants. Coal mining is associated with some of the most unpleasant industrial diseases ever recorded. Why would a trade unionist wish to expose working people to these dangers, when they could instead be employed, at minimal risk to their health, building and installing wind turbines, wave machines and solar power plants?</p> <p>Scargill maintains that nuclear power is four times as expensive as coal-fired electricity. There's a standard model for estimating future costs, of which he should be aware, produced by the International Energy Agency. This shows that it's likely to be 10%-50% more expensive to save a tonne of carbon through coal burning with carbon capture and storage than by means of nuclear energy. (Wind power, incidentally, is much cheaper than either.) The agency's figures are not definitive - nothing in this field is - but the estimates it gives are for coal bought at anticipated market prices, not for the much more expensive fuel Arthur proposes: coal produced only from deep mines in the UK. </p> <p>I feel I need to point out that I have not become an advocate for nuclear power. My position is that environmentalists should stop trying to pick technologies for electricity generation. Instead we should demand a maximum level for the carbon dioxide produced per megawatt-hour, impose a number of other public safety measures, then allow the energy companies to find the cheapest means of delivering it. Otherwise we are in danger of backing the solutions we find aesthetically appealing and delaying the massive carbon cuts that need to be made. If nuclear power meets the very tough conditions I proposed last week, we should no longer oppose it - though that remains a big if. This is too subtle a point for Arthur and other commentators, who are shrieking that Monbiot has gone nuclear. </p> <p>Scargill claims that the closure of most of the UK's coal plants has not been accompanied by lower carbon emissions. In fact, carbon pollution has faithfully tracked coal burning for the past 18 years. In 1990, when consistent carbon data for the UK began, this country used 108 million tonnes of coal and produced 592m tonnes of carbon dioxide. In 1999, coal consumption fell to its lowest level since 1970 (56m) and the UK's emissions fell to their lowest level since 1990 (540m). Emissions rose in 2006 because coal burning increased when gas prices shot up. They fell back again in 2007 when the gas price dropped. In all cases, coal has been the key swing factor for CO2 production. </p> <p>When Scargill suggests that, by mining and refining coal, \"we can provide all the electricity, oil, gas and petrochemicals that people need, without causing harm to the environment\", he shows that he is living in a world of make-believe. He rightly demands that we \"end the import of shale oil, tar sands and other so-called unconventional oils\" and calls them \"the dirtiest fuels on the planet\". But while the total carbon emissions from petrol made out of tar sands are 30%-70% higher than those from conventional petroleum, turning coal into transport fuel raises emissions by 85%. The process also requires 10 gallons of fresh water for every gallon of fuel produced. Coal, not tar sand, is the dirtiest fuel on the planet. </p> <p>When he speaks of a resurgent coal industry, he pictures deep seams hacked out by grimy workers romantically dying of silicosis. But, with a few minor exceptions, this is no longer how coal is produced in the UK. New research I've commissioned, published for the first time here, shows that the industry is planning a great opencast revival. Since January last year, 22 new opencast coal mines or mine extensions have been approved by British planning authorities. Only two schemes - both of them quite small - have been rejected without appeal. My researcher, Ketty Dean, has discovered that mining companies have applied for planning permission for a further 22 schemes, while 11 more applications in England alone are about to be submitted. </p> <p>Altogether, if the new proposals are accepted, 55 million tonnes of coal extraction is in the pipeline. If we accept the outer limit proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for the carbon cut required to prevent more than 2C of warming (85% worldwide, which means 95.9% in the UK), the coal these pits will produce equates to the sustainable annual emissions of 280 million people. </p> <p>This digging can happen only at the expense of the communities Scargill claims to support. The Coal Forum is a government-funded lobby group in which coal companies and civil servants plot against the public interest. Its latest minutes reveal that if - as the Welsh assembly now proposes - there is a minimum distance of 500 metres between opencast pits and the nearest homes, this would \"sterilise\" all the useful coal reserves in Wales. This means that they could no longer be dug. The pits are viable only if they are allowed to wreck the lives of local people. Even before a lump of clean coal is burned, its extraction trashes the environment. </p> <p>Arthur Scargill ends his column with a final appeal to reason - by challenging me to a duel. \"I am prepared to go into a room full of CO2 for two minutes, if he is prepared to go into a room full of radiation for two minutes.\" I accept his challenge, as long as I can choose my source of radiation. I invite Arthur to propose a date and send me the name of his second. I hope he can hold his breath.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The Bush administration yesterday announced plans to relax the law protecting endangered species to allow federal agencies to decide for themselves whether construction projects such as highways, dams or mines might harm endangered animals and plants.</p> <p>Under the altered rules, the government would no longer have to consult with independent scientists about the effect of new projects on wildlife. Thousands of consultations take place every year.</p> <p>The US interior secretary, Dirk Kempthorne, said the proposal would help the US use the species law \"more efficiently and avoid misusing it to regulate global climate change\". He added: \"It is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impact affecting species.\" </p> <p>Environmental campaigners condemned the planned changes as a \"sneak attack\" on species protections that have existed since 1973. John Kostyack, executive director of conservation at the National Wildlife Federation, said: \"These changes take unbiased, professional wildlife biologists out of the equation and put decisions in the hands of political appointees.\"</p> <p>Kempthorne defended the proposal as an effort to clear up \"confusion\" and prevent \"unnecessary\" wildlife protection work. In a draft version of the plan leaked to the media, his department claimed US government agencies would \"err on the side of caution\" when performing their internal environmental reviews.</p> <p>The Bush administration is not required to consult with Congress before approving the changes, even though a similar proposal died in Congress three years ago.</p> <p>The senior Democrat on the Senate environment committee, Barbara Boxer, said the species plan amounted to an illegal \"back door\" repeal of environmental law. \"If this proposed regulation had been in place, it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle, the grizzly bear and the grey whale,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Scotland has lost its lead over England in attracting young applicants to university, new figures show.</p> <p>The statistics from Universities UK, which represents higher education institutions, published today, show Scotland led with 406 applications<br>per thousand of its 17-year old population in 2004, compared to England's 400 applicants. But in 2008 England is way ahead with 475 applications, with Scotland trailing at 425.</p> <p>Scotland's increase over the four-year period was also less than Wales, which saw a rise of 45 applicants per thousand of its 17-year old population, compared to Scotland's 19, and less than Northern Ireland which rose by 21 to 577.</p> <p>Scottish universities have expressed concern and confusion over the lacklustre growth in young applicants to the nation's institutions. They say it is strange that applicants in England have risen above Scotland at a time when the former has introduced fees.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said, \"It is encouraging to see that the proportion of 17-year-olds applying to Scottish universities has continued to increase. However, over the next 20 years the proportion of 17-year-olds in Scotland is expected to decline significantly. If Scotland is to achieve sustainable economic growth in the global economy, it must have the right people and skills to compete. Other countries like Finland and Sweden are achieving higher education participation rates of over 70 per cent. All the projections show that growth will occur in occupations that are high in skill and at managerial and professional level. It is therefore vital to Scotland's future prosperity that we<br>encourage and inspire people to go into university\".</p> <p>The University and College Union in Scotland suggested the dramatic decrease in the number of English students applying to Scottish universities this year may have also contributed to the slowed growth.</p> <p>\"It is of concern.

  "<p>Water companies in England and Wales want bills to go up by about \u00a330 plus inflation over five years from 2010 to pay for renewing ageing infrastructure, developing new supplies and tackling the effects of climate change.</p> <p>Water UK, which represents water and waste water companies, said the increases amounted to an average of \u00a36 a year, which would take the average bill to \u00a3350 by 2015. The actual bills are likely to be higher because Water UK's calculations are based on 2007-08 prices and do not include the effect of inflation.</p> <p>Although the new price regime will not be decided until next November by the industry regulator, Ofwat, and will not come into effect until 2010, the process is taking place against a background of sharp rises in household energy bills.</p> <p>Water UK said its figures covered a wide range of increases, from an average of less than \u00a32 a year to \u00a315. Southern Water wants to increase prices by an average of 4.5% a year above inflation to pay for \u00a32.6bn of investment. A number of smaller companies are pressing for similar rises.</p> <p>Thames, the largest water company, wants to raise prices 3% a year, before inflation, to fund \u00a36.5bn of investment.</p> <p>Severn Trent and Welsh Water are among those seeking to keep increases in line with inflation or close to it.</p> <p>Pamela Taylor, chief executive of Water UK, said the overall industry proposals for investment in new plant and pipes for the five years was \u00a327bn, more than \u00a37bn higher than in the five years to 2010. Taylor noted the range of bill increases between different companies. \"One of the things the industry has long called for is to move on from a 'one-size-fits-all' mentality to one that reflects regional need. Customers will be hoping the regulator will reflect this regional diversity in the final determinations in 2009.\"</p> <p>She warned of the consequences of squeezing the companies' capital maintenance plans. \"Our view is that realistic investment in renewing assets can't be put off indefinitely. At least it can't without risking a fall-off in service that customers would hate and could seriously damage the economy and the environment.\"</p> <p>Richard Laikin, a director in Ernst &amp; Young's water team, said the companies now included the impact of climate change when considering pricing plans.</p> <p>\"Some of this increase is also aimed, for the first time, at dealing with climate change-related issues, from improving the flood resilience of critical infrastructure to widespread plans to increase household metering.\" </p> <p>He warned that in the current economic climate the companies were likely to face increased problems with bad debt.</p> <p>He added: \"Ofwat have a very difficult task in balancing the requirement for significant investment with customers' priorities not to see bills increase more than is necessary.\" </p> <p>Dame Yve Buckland, chair of the Consumer Council for Water, said: \"Water and sewerage prices between 2010 and 2015 need to be set in line with what customers are willing and able to pay, and companies should deliver a package of benefits in line with what consumers see as a priority.</p> <p>\"The Consumer Council for Water has encouraged water companies to give extra back to consumers and this has resulted in \u00a3130m of benefits in two years. We will take the same approach in pressing Ofwat and the companies to be guided by the needs of consumers up to 2015.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain's pension schemes were driven into the red in July after falling stockmarkets and rising bond prices eradicated the surplus registered in June.</p> <p>The official calculation by the Pension Protection Fund, which was established to pay compensation to members of defunct company pension schemes, demonstrates the volatility in the financing of retirement plans across Britain.</p> <p>Its research covers 7,800 defined benefit schemes - which are linked to final salaries - and found that they recorded a deficit of \u00a324.1bn at the end of July, compared with a surplus of \u00a38.3bn at the end of June. Even more dramatic is the contrast with a year ago, when there was a surplus of \u00a383.3bn.</p> <p>The deficit is calculated by valuing the total assets of the funds minus their liabilities and is affected by the prices of bonds and shares.</p> <p>According to the PPF, there was a fall in the value of pension fund assets in July of 1.8% because of a drop in UK and global share prices. There was also rise in pension funds' liabilities as these are calculated by using bond yields, which have fallen as their prices have risen. </p> <p>\"Over the past year, the negative impact of equities on scheme assets combined with falling bond yields have led to an overall worsening of the funding position, resulting in a 8.6% increase in aggregate liabilities, while weaker equities have reduced assets by 7.4%,\" the PPF said.</p> <p>Its findings follow calculations by actuaries Lane Clark &amp; Peacock based on the pension schemes of companies in the FTSE 100, which found a surplus of \u00a312bn a year ago had swung to a \u00a341bn deficit - the biggest change since 2002. The actuaries pointed out that the shortfall would have been greater if companies had not pumped \u00a340bn into the schemes in the last three years in an attempt to eradicate the deficits.</p> <p>Many defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members because of the volatility and cost of funding them. Those that remain face pressure from trustees to pour money into them to try to close the gap in their financing.</p> <p>Not all the schemes surveyed by the PPF were in deficit. It found that in July 76% of the schemes in its survey were in deficit. That total of 5,857 funds in the red compared with 5,499 in the previous month.</p> <p>The PPF calculation is based on what would have to be paid to an insurance company to fund the level of compensation required if the company supporting the pension scheme went bust.</p>",
  "<p>The cost of fuel and raw materials for Britain's hard-pressed manufacturers fell for the first time in a year last month, the government said yesterday, amid signs on financial markets that the global surge in commodity markets of the past year is coming to an end.</p> <p>Although industry is paying almost a third more for items such as energy and metals than it did last summer, the annual rate of increase recorded by the producer prices index dipped slightly in July as oil prices retreated from their record high of $147 a barrel. The cost of crude yesterday was more than $30 below its peak and was up only slightly at $115 a barrel after the weekend fighting between Russia and Georgia.</p> <p>Other commodities used by factories have also dropped sharply in price, with copper at a six-month low of $7,329.50 a tonne in London yesterday. Commodity prices have slipped as the dollar has strengthened on the foreign exchange markets, with copper now 17% cheaper than it was at the start of July.</p> <p>The latest snapshot of Britain's small and medium-sized manufacturers from the CBI out today showed how businesses have been affected by spiralling costs. In a finding that is likely to alarm the Bank of England, the employers' organisation said SMEs were responding to a squeeze on margins by pushing up their prices at the fastest rate in 13 years. Domestic and export order books were down.</p> <p>Russel Griggs, chairman of the CBI's SME council, said: \"Although pockets of stronger performance do exist in the manufacturing world, it is a real concern that orders and output have fallen and are set to fall again. There is no doubt this is a challenging time for many small and medium-sized firms. Many are trying to stay on top of higher energy and raw material costs, and are finding it difficult to pass these on to customers through higher prices.\"</p> <p>Figures released by the Office for National Statistics yesterday revealed a 0.6% drop in fuel and raw material prices paid by manufacturers last month. The annual rate of input-price inflation for industry - which was falling slightly in July last year - stood at 30.1% last month, a modest fall from the 30.8% recorded in June. Over the past year, firms have paid 75% more for their gas, 79% more for oil and 21% more for imported materials.</p> <p>Fuel and raw materials account for one third of the costs of manufacturers, and the scale of the increases of the past 12 months have pushed up the price of goods leaving factory gates. Output prices were 10.2% higher in July than they were a year ago, the highest annual rate of increase since records on a consistent basis began in 1986. The ONS said a rate of increase of 10.7% was recorded in 1982 but the data was based on a different definition of manufacturing.</p> <p>Paul Dales, analyst at Capital Economics, said: \"The sharp falls in oil, gas and wholesale food prices seen in recent weeks suggest that price pressures right at the start of the inflation pipeline may be close to a peak.\"</p> <p>Separate figures from the ONS yesterday indicated that the decline in the pound is doing little to narrow Britain's trade gap. Despite a record surplus for services, the overall trade gap with the rest of the world widened from \u00a34.1bn to \u00a34.4bn in June - its largest since February. Exports of goods were up by \u00a30.7bn between May and June, but there was an even bigger rise of \u00a31.1bn in imports.</p>",
  "<p>Isaac Hayes, who has died aged 65, earned massive international acclaim and a niche in the record books from writing the Oscar-winning theme for the movie Shaft in 1971. But that was only the tip of the iceberg of Hayes's talents, which comprised skills as a multi-instrumentalist, producer, arranger and vocalist, as well as composer, songwriter and actor. The musical innovations he pioneered throughout his career made him an influential figure in the development of soul and disco, and he was later dubbed the \"Original Rapper\". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.</p> <p>Born in Covington, Tennessee, Hayes was raised by his sharecropper grandparents in their shack after his mother had died and his father walked out. When he moved with his grandparents to Memphis, he took jobs as a bus boy and dishwasher to help boost the household's dire finances, but it was a sign of things to come when he won a talent show singing the Nat King Cole hit Looking Back. \"Career change!\" recalled Hayes, whose only previous musical experience was singing in church as a boy. \"I started pursuing music big time.\"</p> <p>He began finding work as a musician in local clubs and formed several shortlived groups, including Sir Isaac and the Doo-Dads and Calvin Valentine and the Swing Cats. Then he signed on as pianist with saxophonist Floyd Newman, who was also a staff musician for the new Memphis label, Stax. This brought Hayes an invitation to stand in on keyboards for a temporarily absent Booker T Jones, from the Stax house band Booker T &amp; the MGs, and he played his first paid sessions with Otis Redding in early 1964. </p> <p>Hayes had become a familiar face around Stax when the writer and producer David Porter suggested they collaborate as songwriters. It was an inspired move, and soon the Porter/Hayes duo (alias the Soul Children) were banging out such classics as Soul Man, When Something Is Wrong With My Baby and Hold On, I'm Coming for Sam &amp; Dave, and the sublime B-A-B-Y for Carla Thomas. Hayes's work at Stax helped to create the Memphis Sound, which influenced the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and almost everybody who mattered in pop.</p> <p>The assassination of Martin Luther King in Memphis on April 4 1968 was especially shattering for Hayes, who had joined King's civil rights marches and was due to meet him on the day of his death. \"I thought 'I can't do a thing about it, so let me become successful and powerful enough where I can have a voice to make a difference.' \" His first solo album, Presenting Isaac Hayes, was released that year. It sold insignificantly, but his 1969 follow-up, Hot Buttered Soul, sold 1m copies and represented a bold artistic advance. It contained only four tracks, and its complex symphonic arrangements and verbal monologues pointed the way ahead to 1970s concept albums by Marvin Gaye, Barry White and Stevie Wonder. His expanded versions of Burt Bacharach's Walk on By and Jimmy Webb's By the Time I Get to Phoenix still sound revolutionary. </p> <p>Hayes's Shaft moment duly arrived in 1971, and his double-album soundtrack made him the first African-American to win an Academy award. The Theme from Shaft, with its tense beat, edgy wah-wah guitars and effortlessly hip monologue, became a Grammy-winning chart-topper, made No 4 in the UK and made Hayes a global star. He was the godfather of bling in his gold chains and interplanetary costumes, as well as one of the most imitated musicians on the planet. He was showered with film and television work, scoring the TV show The Men and the movies Tough Guys and Truck Turner (both of which also starred Hayes, who played a bartender in Shaft). His Truck Turner score would be used by Quentin Tarantino in his Kill Bill movies. In 1974 he debuted in the recurring role of Jim Rockford's fellow ex-con in The Rockford Files. </p> <p>Hayes released a second successful double-album in 1971, Black Moses, and his US chart-topping Live at the Sahara Tahoe made it three. His 1973 album Joy included the hit I Love You That's All, later sampled by numerous artists, including Massive Attack and Eric B &amp; Rakim. </p> <p>In 1975, following a struggle with Stax over royalties, Hayes set up his own Hot Buttered Soul (HBS) label, under the wing of ABC. He scored a big hit with the disco-orientated Chocolate Chip, though follow-ups Disco Connection and Groove-A-Thon proved less commercial. By 1976 he somehow found himself $6m in debt, and was mortified to see his solid gold Cadillac Eldorado go to the tax authorities. </p> <p>However, he lost no time in staging a comeback, teaming up with Dionne Warwick for the 1977 double-LP A Man and a Woman, and co-writing Warwick's US Top 20 hit, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. Hayes signed a solo deal with Polydor and notched hit singles with Zeke the Freak, Don't Let Go and Do You Wanna Make Love. The last of these was from his final 70s album, a duet with Millie Jackson called Royal Rappin's (1979).</p> <p>The 1980s proved unrewarding musically, but Hayes compensated by stepping up his acting work. He played the villain in John Carpenter's Escape from New York, appeared in action romps Counterforce and Dead Aim, and adorned the small screen in The A-Team, Hunter and Miami Vice. In 1988, he appeared in the Keenen Ivory Wayans comedy I'm Gonna Git You, Sucka, a satire of Shaft-style blaxploitation films. </p> <p>Numerous film parts followed through the 1990s. Hayes now signed a record deal with Columbia. His album U-Turn contained Ike's Rap, featuring a powerful anti-crack message (\"Don't be a resident of crack city\"). He also agreed to lecture in colleges in prisons about the perils of drug addiction. </p> <p>In 1992, Hayes explored his humanitarian bent further when he and Warwick accepted an invitation to visit the Cape coast and the Elmina slave castles of Ghana. Much moved, Hayes committed himself to raising funds to improve social and educational standards in Ghana. He was rewarded by being made a Ghanaian king. He subsequently founded the Isaac Hayes Foundation, to promote literacy, musical and nutritional education around the world. He was an enthusiastic chef who owned restaurants in Memphis and Chicago, and often performed at both. </p> <p>In 1997, his culinary leanings led to his being cast as the voice of Chef in the animated TV show South Park. Hayes described the character as \"a person that speaks his mind; he's sensitive enough to care for children ... And he loves the ladies\". Chocolate Salty Balls (PS I Love You), a song performed by Chef, was his first UK chart-topper. However, he left the series acrimoniously, apparently offended by an episode that satirised Scientology, which he espoused and promoted. South Park's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, argued that Hayes had not objected to other religions being lampooned, but wanted to apply different standards to Scientology. </p> <p>Hayes suffered a stroke in 2006, and appeared confused and disorientated on a TV talk show earlier this year. Last Sunday, he was found unconscious by his wife Adjowa at his home near Memphis, apparently having collapsed while using a treadmill. He was pronounced dead at Memphis's Baptist Memorial hospital, and was thought to have suffered a simultaneous stroke and heart attack. Adjowa was his fourth wife. He fathered 12 children.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Isaac Hayes, musician, born August 20 1942; died August 10 2008</p>",
  "<p>What, pray, is all the fuss about? Since August 9 last year, we have (according to the sages at the International Monetary Fund) been in \"the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression\". Aditya Chakrabortty, in these pages last week, was the latest to claim that the past year's \"financial drama\" has produced \"a bonfire of capitalist certainties\". Phooey.</p> <p>If this is the worst crisis since the Great Depression then we must have all been living pretty cushy, gilded lives since the 1930s. If this is all it takes to destroy capitalism (or at least its certainties), then it is a wonder why the Soviet Union failed to do so during its seven decades of existence.</p> <p>For the past year has actually not been very bad at all - unless you are a banker, a bank shareholder or Gordon Brown; and few will shed tears for any of those. Unemployment, that traditional begetter of rebellions against capitalism, hasn't risen at all. In fact it has dropped from 5.4% to 5.2% of the workforce. The economy grew in the year to the second quarter by, oh my gosh, just 1.6%. Earnings have been rising by - yikes! - 3.8% a year. Let's all head for the hills.</p> <p>The only statistics that point strongly in a downward direction are those for bank shares, house prices and mortgage lending. So far this has really been a crisis just for the Daily Mail and the Financial Times. Oh, and the IMF. Most ordinary people have been affected more by inflation, in the form of rising petrol and food prices, than by anything connected to the supposed crisis of capitalism. Anyone who can remember the unemployment of the early 1980s or the early 90s, or the inflation of the 70s and 80s, ought to be shaking their heads in disbelief at all the kerfuffle over what is just a mild slowdown.</p> <p>That is surely the real reason why the left has \"gone awol\", as Chakrabortty suggested. The sort of people the left are most concerned about have not been affected very much, at least not since they felt a twinge of worry about their savings in Northern Rock last autumn. And since the basic reason why petrol and food prices have been rising is that a lot of poor people in China and India have been getting wealthier and that their central banks have not been clamping down on monetary growth, inflation is not going to provide much traction for anti-capitalist campaigners.</p> <p>This is not intended to make light of 5.2% unemployment, which amounts to 1.6 million people, nor of the issues of poverty and inequality. But those issues have not changed in the past year: they were there during the prosperous years and they are there now. They have not been altered for better or for worse by the credit crunch.</p> <p>Of course, these sanguine views may just be akin to the judgment of the proverbial building-jumper who remarks when halfway to the ground that so far the fall hasn't been too bad. Perhaps we will soon hit the ground with a thud. We might: there are reasons to think that things could indeed get worse. But they still don't amount to anything that justifies the hyperbole.</p> <p>In the past month the price of oil has fallen by more than 20% and food prices have also been falling. Partly, this is because more oil is being pumped and more food is being grown. But also this good news has happened for the bad reason that global economic growth is slowing and hence demand for energy and food. Much of that slowdown has happened in America and western Europe. More critical, though, could be the slowing of demand in China and India.</p> <p>The first year since the credit crunch began has been a mild affair chiefly because exports from America and even Britain have been growing, partly thanks to demand from Asia. If China and India now deal with their inflation problem by cutting their economic growth quite sharply, that support from exports will fade.</p> <p>If that happens, then some of the doom-laden predictions about the credit crunch could begin to come true. Rather than just being a matter of banks writing off loan losses for sub-prime mortgages and complex derivative securities, a much weaker economy could make the loan defaults spread into corporate and consumer borrowing, adding to the banks' losses and making them even less willing to lend.</p> <p>That sort of downward spiral is what a true credit crunch would consist of, and if it were to last a long time it could even bring some sort of crisis for capitalism. Essentially, that is what happened in Japan during the 1990s: loan defaults gradually accumulated, forcing banks to cut lending, which produced more loan defaults, and an even weaker economy.</p> <p>Yet it is not at all clear that this is what is going to happen. If petrol and food carry on getting cheaper, the Bank of England will start to cut interest rates. China, India and other emerging markets will grow more slowly if their central banks do start to take inflation seriously, but by \"slowly\" is meant 8% and 6% respectively, and there is no reason to expect their slowdown to last very long. Globally, there is no credit crunch: money is abundant. </p> <p>\"Crisis, what crisis?\", as a Labour prime minister once didn't quite say, in rather worse times than today's.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bill Emmott is a former editor of the Economist and the author of Rivals: How the Power Struggle between China, India and Japan will Shape our Next Decade <a href=\"mailto:bill@billemmott.com\">bill@billemmott.com</a></p>",
  "<h2>Age 10-20</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336480632\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/08/12/jump1.jpg\" alt=\"Jumping\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Whatever the reasons - fewer school playing fields and less time spent doing PE, fewer children walking to school and \"paranoid parents\" stopping them from climbing trees - most of this age group \"do bugger all', according to specialist sports doctor Catherine Spencer-Smith. \"We need to get them active so their generation doesn't die before us,\" she says.</p> <p>A wide range of activities is preferable. \"Building up as much bone mineral density as possible is vital,\" says Dr Spencer-Smith. </p> <p>\"Hopping, running, skipping, jumping off things and rapid twisting are all important.\"</p> <p>Weight training was previously thought to be detrimental to the physical development of adolescents, but there has recently been a substantial shift in thinking, and exercising with weights is known to increase bone density.</p> <p>\"If a child is old enough and sensible enough to follow instructions, say from the age of 11, a programme of light weights and high repetitions is a good idea,\" adds Spencer-Smith. \"It is safe, provided they are supervised, the technique is good and, crucially, that they are not lifting weights that are too heavy. A good rule to follow is that if they cannot easily do 10 repetitions, the weights are too heavy.\"</p> <p>Instilling good technique pays off in later years. John Shepherd, author of The Complete Guide To Sports Training, is 46 and came second in the recent European Masters long jump. \"I'm lucky, I've never had any real injuries, perhaps because my limbs are in alignment during activities thanks to proper instruction from an early age.\"</p> <p><strong>How much do you need to do?</strong> <br>Three to five one-hour sessions a week of running, jumping etc. All exercise, at any age, should be followed by stretching. Keen children could do an additional two one-hour weights sessions.</p> <h2>Age 20-30</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336480633\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/08/12/stretch1.jpg\" alt=\"Stretching\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It is still important to develop bone mineral density at this age, so the ideal activities are weight-bearing, dynamic ones, such as running, dancing, football or martial arts. </p> <p>\"It is also good to do some posture work, such as Pilates, yoga, Alexander technique or balancing exercises on a Fitball [or Swiss ball],\" says Spencer-Smith. \"Anything involving balance is good, and it doesn't have to be a formal, organised activity: dance is great. At this age, you may well be a desk slave, so it is particularly important to develop good postural habits. It is also a good idea to become accustomed to doing some kind of regular exercise - for example, cycling or jogging - to destress.\"</p> <p>For women who want to become pregnant, Spencer-Smith adds: \"If you are overweight or sedentary, you may well experience fertility issues. Exercise can help with hormone regulation and increase the possibility of conception.\"</p> <p><strong>How much do you need to do?</strong> <br>Three one-hour sessions of cardiovascular activities a week, plus one to three one-hour sessions of Pilates, Alexander technique or yoga.</p> <h2>Age 30-40</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336480634\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/08/12/triathlon1.jpg\" alt=\"Triathlon\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It is possible to play top-class sport until the mid-30s. \"Everything is pretty good until about 35,\" says Karen Hambly, senior lecturer in sports therapy at London Metropolitan University. \"Thereafter, a whole series of things is going on. It's like having a car; when there are a few miles on the clock, things start to break down. Our resting heart rate increases and our muscle mass and strength decrease.\"</p> <p>Central to this is the decrease, in both sexes, of production of growth hormone (GH) by the pituitary gland. GH is the primary stimulus for muscle, bone and tendon strength, and is also closely linked with the mobilisation of fat as fuel, thus helping maintain a lean physique. </p> <p>\"Intense exercise helps us to produce more GH,\" says Shepherd, \"increasing our youthfulness and vitality and improving our skin tone. So it is important to do short, intense bursts of activity at this age, rather than thinking that fitness is all about building endurance. Whatever cardiovascular activity you do, be it indoor rowing, running, swimming or triathlon, make sure you also do strength training. You can lose loads of weight doing endurance work, but weight training develops the whole body.\" Weight training can be done on gym resistance machines, although free weights improve core strength better as there is no machine to support your body.</p> <p><strong>How much do you need to do?</strong> <br>Two to four one-hour sessions of weights, followed by cardiovascular work and stretching. In addition, one to three sessions a week of Pilates, Alexander technique, tai chi or yoga.</p> <h2>Age 40-50</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336480635\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/08/12/weight1.jpg\" alt=\"Lifting weights\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The fifth decade is when our bodies express, ever more loudly, what they have been put through. Joint wear and tear is commonplace, with signs of osteoarthritis often coming to light. Given that lung function declines with age, it is important to maintain cardiovascular fitness. If your knees are painful, then swim, cycle or use an indoor rower. Whatever the state of your joints, this is a good time to undergo gait analysis, which involves running on a treadmill while a sports-injury specialist, aided by a bundle of computer software, assesses postural abnormalities. \"We can prevent decline in physical function later in life by pinpointing and dealing with problems now,\" says Mitchell Phillips, a postural and sports-injury therapist.</p> <p>Strength work is a must, too, as the pituitary gland grows wearier still of producing GH. \"Compound moves, such as squats, deadlifts and bench presses, done with medium to heavy weights are the key,\" says Shepherd. \"Free weights are better than machines, as they improve functional strength and work the core and, again, proper instruction is important. You're looking at four sets of each exercise, of about six to 10 repeats, so you're targeting your fast-twitch muscle fibres [muscle fibres used for intense, sprint-type movements, as opposed to slow-twitch fibres used for endurance exercise]. The more muscle mass you have, the higher your metabolic rate and the more fat you burn when you're resting. If you are new to weight training, though, start slowly. You have to precondition your body.\"</p> <p><strong>How much do you need to do? </strong><br>Two to four one-hour sessions of cardiovascular work, weights/resistance and stretching. In addition, do Pilates, Alexander technique, yoga or tai chi one to three times a week.</p> <h2>Age 50-60</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336480636\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/08/12/row1.jpg\" alt=\"Rowing\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Investment for later life is the mantra as we approach retirement age. \"Nerve conduction and reflexes slow down as we age,\" says Hambly. \"While we can't turn back the tide, we can slow the rate of decrease. A classic cause of disability in elderly people is falling, because of loss of balance. Before we reach that stage, if we can reduce the slowing down of the nervous system, we can reduce the likelihood of falling when we're older.\"</p> <p>Pilates, Alexander technique and core-stability exercises can work wonders in training the neural system. Proprioception refers to the brain's ability to know where our limbs are in space without having to look. To aid his clients' proprioception, personal trainer Bob Rising, 60, gets them to stand on one foot. \"Try doing it with your eyes closed. All the muscles twitch and, at first, you might panic. Then you start to improve.\"</p> <p>Strength training is a must, too. Use lighter weights, or rubber resistance bands instead. Aim for 20 to 30 repeats. For cardiovascular fitness, Hambly suggests swimming, walking, cycling and rowing indoors or on water. \"Low-impact exercise is best. It is all about protecting the knees and hips.\" </p> <p><strong>How much do you need to do?</strong> <br>Two to four one-hour cardiovascular and weights/resistance sessions, followed by stretching. Also Pilates, Alexander technique, yoga or tai chi one to three times a week. </p> <h2>Age 60-70</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336480637\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/08/12/swim1.jpg\" alt=\"Swimming\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Between the ages of 30 and 70, the average person loses 25% of their muscle mass. In this decade alone, they lose 15% of their strength. Relatively speaking, though, endurance increases, hence the number of veteran runners in marathons. While it could be argued that it would make sense to go in for plodding, ultra-distance challenges to boost fitness levels, working on weaknesses, ie strength, should take priority.</p> <p>Balance, body awareness and ability to function in daily life can be enhanced by strength work. \"Without wishing to sound depressing, we're not talking about building strength, but decreasing the decline,\" says Hambly. You can't do high-intensity sports at this age (swimming is your best bet for cardiovascular fitness). With weights, use lighter ones and do up to 30 repeats, perhaps with a longer recovery time between sets, and rest days between sessions. Work the upper body once or twice a week, and the lower body once or twice on different days, so you have plenty of recovery time. Acceptance is mandatory. \"It's not about throwing the towel in. It's about being realistic,\" says Hambly.</p> <p><strong>How much do you need to do? </strong><br>Two to four one-hour cardiovascular and weights/resistance sessions, plus Pilates, Alexander technique, yoga or tai chi one to three times a week.</p> <h2>Age 70-80</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336480638\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/08/12/taichi1.jpg\" alt=\"Tai chi\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Our metabolism slows down as we become older and we require a lower caloric intake. This should be borne in mind when we exercise - otherwise that post-workout hunger could result in excess calories and increased body fat. Social aspects become an important driver in staying active in your 70s.</p> <p>Yoga, t'ai chi and Pilates are all beneficial. \"Anything that can promote the idea of standing up, balancing, stretching and breathing, bringing in all that coordination, has got to be good,\" says Phillips.</p> <p>Tai chi, in particular, scores well. A study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, found that this gentle martial art increased physical confidence and reduced falls by 47.5% in people aged over 70. </p> <p>For the more competitive, Hambly has noticed an upsurge in elderly participants joining table tennis and badminton clubs. \"You can play them with a limited level of mobility, get a really good cardiovascular workout, and socialise,\" she says. Golf is also popular, although because it is a repetitive, \"one-sided\" activity, it can lead to hip injuries.</p> <p><strong>How much do you need to do?</strong> <br>Two classes each week of t'ai chi, yoga or Pilates and two sessions of cardiovascular exercise.</p> <h2>Age 80-plus</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336480639\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/08/12/nordic1.jpg\" alt=\"Nordic walking\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Nordic walking - marching along, using sticks like ski poles for balance and propulsion - is highly recommended for the over-80s. </p> <p>Phillips says it can have a great effect on cardio fitness and endurance. \"The balance and stability that the poles provide help to reduce the risk of falling, regardless of the environment, so it can mean the difference between going out and exercising and doing nothing at all.\"</p> <p>\"As you get older, it's more important than ever to get the right gear,\" says Hambly. \"As we age, our thermoregulation isn't so good, so it may be an idea to wear more layers of sports clothing when you exercise.\" She also emphasises the importance of getting walking or running shoes appropriate to your gait. That means going to a specialist running shop.</p> <p>Swimming - which will soon be free for all over-60s as part of the 2012 programme - is also good exercise for this age group. </p> <p>Hambly stresses the importance of stretching after exercise. \"Elasticity in muscles and tendons decreases with age,\" she says, \"and the more supple you are, the better. </p> <p>If your balance isn't great to start with, do static stretching, and if you can manage something more dynamic, go for gentle yoga or Pilates.\"</p> <p><strong>How much do you need to do? </strong><br>Daily gentle cardiovascular exercise and stretching.</p>",
  "<p>These were words to gladden the heart. \"Wealth is about so much more than pounds or euros or dollars can ever measure. It's time we admitted that there's more to life than money. It's time we focused not just on GDP, but on GWB - general well being.\" This was David Cameron, 2006 vintage. His speech to the Google Zeitgeist conference suggested a new set of political and economic priorities. He spoke of a \"passionate desire for capitalism with commitment\". He noted that many companies and ordinary people \"are expressing a profound dissatisfaction with rootless, rampaging globalisation\".</p> <p>Fast-forward two years, to the verge of a recession and the fears of knife crime, and what do we hear? Society is broken; more prisons should be built; more people should be denied bail. While the Tories are nowhere near the point of Michael Howard's dog-whistle anti-immigrant pitch of 2005, they are slipping back into their political comfort zone. That is a shame for the country, and a lost opportunity for them.</p> <p>In many ways the move was inevitable. Some might argue that the terms touchy feely and Tory are an oxymoron, and that politicians are found out when they branch out into unfamiliar territory. Another reason is the profound electoral shift of the intervening period. In the dying days of Blair, Cameron lagged behind. He needed the liberal floating voter, so he sought to hug Polly Toynbee, the hoodies and the huskies. Now, with so many votes in the bag, these are superfluous to requirements.</p> <p>The most compelling explanation is the stifling grip of the political consensus. New Labour and Conservative spin doctors tend to mix in the same social circles. They may differ in some of their conclusions, but the raw data and calculations they feed into their discussions are pretty similar. One rule that applied in 1997 (heard from Peter Mandelson, Alastair Campbell, Philip Gould and others) applies in the equivalent period now: new politics is for wusses. </p> <p>Back then Labour faced a similar journey. Labour folk started off pledging a variety of policies that sought to make people believe in politics again. They advocated stronger rules on corporate transparency. They talked of tighter controls on arms sales. They promised an overhaul of the constitution, strong freedom of information, and a radical shift in party funding. </p> <p>Some of this came about, albeit watered down, but much of it did not. Voters, we were told, were interested only in \"bread and butter\" issues: health, education and crime. As for civil liberties, this government has presided over a broader dismantling of basic rights than any of its predecessors.</p> <p>Power beckons for Cameron. He is reported to be preparing for it already, and Whitehall is preparing for him, months before it is statutorily required to do so. As Labour contemplates the twin nightmares of regicide followed by internal strife versus stasis followed by electoral annihilation, the Tories' choice of priorities is now vital.</p> <p>In some areas the pitch is set. In most it remains deliberately vague. Huggy Cameron talked a good talk about individual freedoms, opposing 42-day detention and identity cards. Will David Davis's departure lead the Tory leadership to loosen these commitments? Many around the boss worry that he is in danger of coming over all soft. </p> <p>On the environment, Cameron appears to have been convinced that his position up to a year or so ago, his \"vote blue, get green\" message, was too ambitious. The Quality of Life policy group report of last September (when the Tories were still contemplating electoral defeat at the hands of a resurgent Gordon Brown) has been widely ridiculed, particularly the idea of increasing taxes on flights and imposing levies on out-of-town supermarket car parks. \"Unmitigated disaster\" and \"overflowing with guff\" were the verdicts of the Spectator's influential website. </p> <p>In these straitened times, green is now linked with posh. Only people educated at Eton shop at farmers' markets, we are now told. Real people are grappling with more immediate concerns. The Tories' green commitment is in danger of being reduced to \"it would be nice if you would dispose of your litter\".</p> <p>So, weaker on human rights and weaker on the environment, what is left? Not much of Cameron's 2006 speech remains intact. Can you imagine him now saying the following? \"Our goal is clear: to move beyond a belief in the Protestant work ethic alone to a modern vision of ethical work.\" He goes on to explain his aspirations towards work-life balance and wellbeing. </p> <p>This is one area where the Labour government of the past 12 months has a record to be proud of. Brown has introduced measures to give 1.4 million agency workers better rights and to extend flexible working rights for parents of school-age children. At the recent Warwick policy forum, more improvements were decided on the minimum wage and maternity leave.</p> <p>Naturally, none of this has been extensively advertised, for fear of offending business groups or certain newspapers; but timidity towards the right has always been the New Labour way. The only person who speaks with any conviction on the work-life agenda is Harriet Harman, who by now is reconciled to the abuse heaped on her in most of the media.</p> <p>Finally, Cameron Mk I was making some interesting noises about fairness, and responsible management practice. Little more has been heard since. Brown, cautious not to offend the City, has said nothing about the underlying reasons for the economic crash. Ministers responded to the collapse of Northern Rock by nationalising and bailing out the bank. No attempt has been made to use the debacle to throw open the debate about the accountability of directors, or the actions of the banking sector. Here is fertile ground for others to occupy. The only person making any noise is the Lib Dems' irrepressible Vince Cable. The Tory leader is silent.</p> <p>Cameron now hides behind his new pet theory of the \"nudge\". Just a gentle prod in the direction of the boardroom and, hey presto, directors will behave responsibly. It seems that the better politics that he toyed with two years ago has gone the way of the better economic conditions. Now that life is really tough again, with people struggling to pay their bills, so the politics will return to its old bad habits.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Kampfner is a former editor of the New Statesman </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jkampfner.net\">www.jkampfner.net</a></p>",
  "<p>Lying toward the east of Beijing in the Chaoyang district, the Workers Stadium was one of the Ten Great Buildings commissioned in 1959 to mark the 10th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. These are somewhat different times, though, and so it is that a new face in town has parked itself right across the street. As this establishment's waitresses shriek in unison at arriving customers: \"Welcome to Hooters Beijing!\" Behold the new face of Chinese capitalism. And please try to stay looking at its face. </p> <p>Whilst other bars in the area were ordered to close for the Olympics by the state authorities, Hooters was never under threat, being one of Beijing's relatively tiny amount of sports bars, and a source of faintly misplaced early-capitalist pride. Following successful openings in Shanghai and Hangzhou, the Atlanta-based chain last year rolled out its nuanced vision of post-feminism-with-buffalo-sauce to Beijing, and the busy new branch is pushing itself as the perfect place to keep your eye on several events at once, on the many screens garlanded with Olympic and Chinese flags. \"Can you keep it on the beach volleyball?\" demands an American concerned at moves to switch channels on his nearest portal into the Corinthian contest playing out at venues across the city.</p> <p>Clientele is 50% foreign, 50% Chinese, says Rachel. Rachel will be your server today - she calls herself Rachel in keeping with the Chinese practice of adopting a Western name they like or which sounds most like their real one - and she's wearing Hooters' international uniform of tight white vest and exceedingly short orange shorts. </p> <p>She recently graduated from university in the city, and confirms this is a almost exclusively a graduate job, partly because of the requirement for decent English, but mainly because of the pay. Hooters waiting staff can expect to be paid 1400-1800 RMB (\u00a3106-\u00a3137) a month, plus tips. The restaurant's turnover is up to 900,000 RMB (\u00a368,000) a month, according to manager Alfie, who says pointedly that he does not encourage his staff to bring their families to the restaurant. </p> <p>Hooters not translating as a pun in Mandarin, Rachel is unaware that the word emblazoned across her vest refers to something other than the owl that goggles away in its logo, as she takes orders beneath a large sign reading \"Caution: blondes thinking\". Unsurprisingly, given it is entirely staffed by local Chinese women, there are no blondes, but the Hooters approach would appear to be: why tamper one iota with a winning formula? Almost every other globalised brand that has made incursions into China has adapted itself to some degree, with McDonalds' menus reflecting regional tastes, for example, whilst IKEA produces Chinese-influenced furniture designs. At Hooters, not so much as a buffalo duck wing corrupts that sacred template, and the Guardian's Chinese translator confirmed the sight of Beijinger waitresses dancing provocatively to Hey Mickey jarred markedly with Beijing's still-conservative culture.</p> <p>Frankly, watching them giggle slightly self-consciously through the choreographed routines, one senses that even were Hooters to roll out its franchise to the Vatican City, it would demand zero deviation from its global standard, for all the likely shortage of suitable applicants.</p> <p>Shanghai is far more progressive and westernised than the capital, landing it the honour of China's first Hooters four years ago, but in Beijing the idea that sex sells is still in its very early days. Hang around long enough in Hooters Beijing, though, and you are left with the impression that the sports stuff is just there to sweeten the pill - Hooters is actually pioneering an approach that, all things being well, will lead to the utopian state already achieved in the west, where you can barely buy an overpriced broadband package without the mirage-like promise of a bunk-up.</p> <p>The US-based website The Smoking Gun recently published Hooters' employment guidelines, which state: \"The Hooters concept is based on female sex appeal and the work environment is one in which joking and sexual innuendo based on female sex appeal is commonplace\". Do they follow that code to the letter here in Beijing? Official guidelines merely stress applicants must be \"cheerful in a lively way and like the sports\".</p> <p>Management stresses all applicants are required to have a good knowledge of local sports - especially Olympics at this time - on which they are examined before being given the job. They must also \"create joyfully the lively dining room atmosphere\".</p> <p>\"I like Hooters. It's very happy. It's enthusiastic and energetic. I love Hooters,\" runs a typically on-message verdict from a Beijing branch waitress - a reminder that Hooters women across the world love their jobs, and the guys they get to serve. Yet the banner near the restaurant entrance reads \"Hooters Beijing loves the Olympics!' and that one feels even easier to buy into.</p>",
  "<p>Seldom can the pressure of Olympic competition have impacted more heavily on a British athlete than Tom Daley. Yesterday six months of hype, expectation and over-exposure weighed like concrete boots on the teenager's dreams and dragged them to the bottom of Beijing's Water Cube. </p> <p>Sunk with him was Blake Aldridge, whose sour reaction to disappointment was to lay the blame on his junior partner. Regardless of who dived worse on the day, and the judges gave Aldridge higher marks on four of the six dives, it was clear that the unique demands of the Olympic arena were too much for a duo with no previous experience of the confidence-sapping nature of such a stage.</p> <p>Expectations that they might claim a medal were always misguided. Debutants seldom flourish at Olympic Games - China's gold-medal pair proved a gloriously accomplished exception - and five of the eight teams had both more experience and better results than the British pair. </p> <p>That did not stop it being promoted as one of the big events of a dramatic day in the aquatic centre. A glance at the morning papers confirmed that Daley is one of the few British athletes at the Games capable of capturing global attention. He was featured on the front page of the China Daily's sports section, his winning smile irresistible in a country where divers are revered as highly as any sportsmen. </p> <p>The VIP attendees in the Water Cube also confirmed that this was a hot ticket. The British Olympic Association's top brass were present and the Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, and sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, were never going to be anywhere else. Bill and Melinda Gates and Henry Kissinger were more surprising attendees, but what they saw departed from the script.</p> <p>At 14 years and 83 days old Daley is an unreliable witness as to why he did not perform to the standards that saw him win European and World Cup medals in the last year. He announced that he was \"quite disappointed\" with the duo's lowest score in competition and said \"it was not our day\".</p> <p>The British team leader, Steve Foley, was more succinct, identifying a pressure-induced loss of trust and confidence between Aldridge and Daley. They ended the competition feuding at the poolside after Aldridge took a call from his mother before the last dive, earning a rebuke from his younger partner, but the collapse began much earlier, when they failed to nail their third dive, the first alternate that sets the tone for the key rounds of the competition. </p> <p>Contrary to Aldridge's view, Foley felt both men had failed to cope but identified the third round, where Aldridge badly missed his entry to the water, as the turning point.</p> <p>\"It looked like on the third dive that he [Aldridge] missed his grab on entry because the water came up so high you had to go for an umbrella,\" he said. \"When you're making little mistakes like your entries, that's nothing but nerves.</p> <p>\"Something I saw before the third dive was that Tom, after they had blown the whistle, he started to take a step and then stopped. So he's in a hurry, he wasn't relaxed and calm. I don't know what his pulse-rate would have been but Blake walked around as if he had the weight of the world on his shoulders. This is half-way through the contest and they didn't come back.\"</p> <p>The trouble began for the British pair long before the final dive when they descended into feuding after Daley reprimanded his partner for waving at his mum. Their second dive, a relatively facile inward one-and-half somersault, was splashy, lacking the precision of their rivals and dropped them out of the medals. Their third, an inward 3\u00bd somersault, was noticeably worse and cost them not only their chances of a medal but the confidence of the judges, who both Foley and Aldridge felt marked them harshly from then on.</p> <p>\"The third was the turning point,\" said Foley. \"If they had drilled that, they would have been right in the mix. Also, I thought they lost the judges' confidence after that. You have to dive good so the judges can't hurt you. But they seemed to cop some pretty tough scores.\"</p> <p>For Daley there is the individual event to look forward to later this week, and beyond that London 2012, by which time he may have learned to say no <br>to the demands of his sponsors as well as a little about how to cope with the biggest stage. </p> <p>For Aldridge there is unlikely to be similar consolation and he knew it. \"My time was now to get a medal,\" he said. \"It was my main chance of getting one and it didn't happen.\"</p> <h2>Do the scores back up Aldridge's claim?</h2> <p>Blake Aldridge blamed Tom Daley for the pair finishing last. The judges' scores below show he had a case.There were four judges, two judging each of them separately on six dives.</p> <p><strong>Daley</strong></p> <p>8.5 8.5</p> <p>7.5 8.5</p> <p>6.0 7.0</p> <p>5.5 7.5</p> <p>7.5 7.0</p> <p>8.5 8.0</p> <p><strong>Aldridge</strong></p> <p>8.0 8.5</p> <p>8.5 8.0</p> <p>7.5 7.5</p> <p>7.0 7.5</p> <p>7.5 7.5</p> <p>7.0 7.0</p>",
  "<p>Jon Sharp has made a surprise return to Super League just two months after leaving Huddersfield, having been appointed as the football operations manager at Hull FC, where he spent 10 years as a player. Sharp, currently working as a coaching consultant at National League One club Featherstone, had been linked with a move to Australia.</p> <p>He has agreed a two-year contract at the KC Stadium starting on December 1, with the remit to assess the club's entire football operation, from grassroots level through to the first team. He will work alongside the current coach Richard Agar. The pair were childhood friends in Featherstone.</p> <p>\"I go back many years with Jon and in my opinion he is a man who will compliment our existing coaching team,\" Agar said. \"This is a ground-breaking appointment and a vital position within the coaching team. I feel Jon's skill and knowledge will be invaluable in creating the required structures and environment to assist myself in maximising the development of our players at every level of the club.\"</p> <p>Sharp guided Huddersfield to their first Super League play-off finish last year, having also taken them to the Challenge Cup final in 2006. He was sacked following a disappointing run of results this season, and has since been working at Featherstone in an advisory role.</p> <p>\"I am looking forward to joining one of the biggest clubs in rugby league and returning to a club where I have a lot of friends and very fond memories from my days as a player,\" Sharp said. \"My role at Hull will be very varied but it will allow me an opportunity to work with all the coaching staff and some of the best players in Super League.\"</p> <p>The Hull winger Gareth Raynor could miss the Challenge Cup final against St Helens on August 30 if he is today found guilty of making a reckless tackle against Huddersfield and banned for more than two games. The Bradford Bulls full-back Michael Platt will also appear before the RFL disciplinary over an alleged head butt in last Friday's defeat to Leeds Rhinos.</p> <p>The Rugby Football League is investigating an incident at Catalans Dragons on Saturday, where the referee Steve Ganson had beer thrown on him at the end of the 16-16 draw with Wigan.

  "<p>The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is backing a couple living in rural Northumberland after they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/11/wildlife\">received</a> an unusual cease and desist letter from their council, asking them to stop feeding the birds in their garden.

  "<p>Millions of people in the Horn of Africa region are facing starvation because of failed harvests and the global increases in the price of food, an aid agency warned today.</p> <p>ActionAid said the situation in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Eritrea and Djibouti could become catastrophic if action was not taken.</p> <p>Last week, the poverty fighting organisation Concern Worldwide warned that millions of people in Ethiopia were facing starvation. The country's February harvest failed due to the worst drought in years.</p> <p>The Ethiopian government estimates that 4.6million people need emergency food aid. </p> <p>The Horn of Africa usually get two rainy seasons a year but many areas have had inadequate rainfall for more than 12 months. Some rain has fallen in the region recently but the charity said it was either too little or too late to ensure a harvest later this year.</p> <p>The drought arrived at the same time as the global increases in the price of food, fuel and fertiliser.</p> <p>Roger Yates, ActionAid's head of emergencies, said: \"People will need emergency food aid well into 2009. Women and children are suffering most from malnutrition and many are now only surviving because of supplementary food rations.</p> <p>\"Smallholders and pastoralists must be helped to get back on their feet as soon as possible.

  "<p>It was easy to spot in Sichuan, and it will undoubtedly be prominent as the Olympics unfold. When the <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/03/oly.sichuan.torch.ap/index.html\">Olympic torch toured the earthquake-ravaged province</a> just days ahead of the games, thousands of onlookers sported identical <a href=\"http://shanghaiist.com/attachments/shang_shanghaiist/Untitled-2.jpg\">\"I (heart) China\" T-shirts</a>. The shirts aren't just a fashion statement in this Olympic moment, but <a href=\"http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90782/90872/6419971.html\">a political statement</a>.</p> <p>\"I (heart) China\" serves as the Beijing regime's succinct public response to foreign criticism of China's human rights record: If our people love our country, then you meddlers from outside ought to just shut up. It's a fair point. </p> <p>In China's Olympic moment, foreign critics are focusing on all the country has failed to achieve, from its abundant air pollution to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/05/china.usa\">scant human rights</a>. China's citizens, on the other hand, see all that the country has accomplished after emerging from foreign domination and internal turmoil. They are proud of those achievements and resentful of foreigners pointing out China's shortcomings, especially when those failings don't bother the alleged victims.</p> <p>Bringing the Olympics to Beijing is the latest instalment in a rather straightforward bargain between Chinese government and its citizens that Deng Xiaoping put in place nearly 30 years ago. The regime would maintain its monopoly on political power, but Chinese citizens would get the opportunity to improve their standards of living. </p> <p>In the 1980s, that meant decent shampoo and high heels. Now the price is substantially higher. Consumer goods and rising incomes to afford more and more are no longer enough. To supplement material advancement and fill the spiritual gap left by the demise of communist ideology, the Beijing leadership has offered its version of circuses to go along with bread, including space travel and, now, the Olympics. </p> <p>When Beijing says it wants politics separate from the Olympics, it's talking about international politics. Domestically, the regime has portrayed the Olympics as a great victory for the people of China, global recognition of China's status as a great power and an endorsement of Communist party rule. In short, it's a reason to don your \"I (heart) China\" shirt.</p> <p>With the government's encouragement and heavy diet of propaganda, the Chinese public has been convinced that anti-Olympic protestors are interlopers bent on insulting China. Government control of information has left the Chinese public brainwashed to believe Tibet has always been part of China and that Beijing is bringing civilisation and development to this backward region, not conducting cultural genocide and resource exploitation. The Chinese public doesn't know what Darfur is or understand how China could be part of genocide among Africans. </p> <p>Moreover, as Beijing is happy to remind the world, the internal affairs of one nation are no business of other nations. The Chinese public also largely accepts the government's position that human rights and freedom are expanding in China, and that no country has a prefect record on this score, so therefore has no right to criticise others. People under 30 in China were born under the one-child policy, so these indulged little emperors and empresses may be particularly surprised and aggrieved to witness expressions of anything other than unfettered love for themselves and, by extension, their country.</p> <p>Under these circumstances, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/06/sports/olympics/07prexy.html?em\">George Bush's public criticism of Beijing's human rights record</a> was the worst move possible if he hopes to convince the government to loosen its grip or win Chinese hearts and minds. Public criticism ensures a negative response from Beijing's leaders, who will lose face by making any concessions. It also ensures that the Chinese public will hunker down in those \"I (heart) China\" shirts, particularly when the speaker is ungracious enough to criticise China while a guest on her soil. </p> <p>Combining his criticism with a visit to China sends precisely the wrong message to the Chinese people. As they see it, even though Bush hates China \u2013 why else would he say such hurtful things? \u2013 China is so powerful that he must nevertheless come to the Olympics to honour China's leadership and people. </p> <p>A much better way to try to change China would be to eschew public criticism and, as the Olympic behaviour guide for Beijingers recommends, avoid public displays of affection for the Chinese leadership. In other words, effusively praise China for its cooperation with the US on North Korea nuclear disarmament, for example, while privately condemn human rights abuses and deny it propaganda victories like appearing at the Olympics, unless earned by specific actions. Rather than <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/31/AR2008073101335.html\">meet publicly with five freed dissidents at the White House</a> recently, Bush should have demanded privately that China release the dozens of dissidents it has arrested as part of its pre-Olympic cleanup effort before he agreed to board Air Force One for Beijing. </p> <p>If Beijing meets the demands, you've won a significant victory and Beijing gets a reward. If Beijing doesn't cooperate, you've denied the regime the oxygen of propaganda so vital to maintaining its grip on hearts and minds. The less potent the propaganda, the more likely China's public will be to question what they hear from the official media. But, no matter what you do, it's up to China's people to start asking the questions. Eventually, they may come to understand that for Chinese as well as foreigners, there's nothing incompatible with challenging the government while wearing an \"I (heart) China\" T-shirt.</p>",
  "<p>One of the more warming pleasures of the Olympics is that it makes stars of ordinary folk; people who talk, think and act like you and me except for their raging desire for sporting excellence. People like Rebecca Adlington.</p> <p>Moments after winning the women's 400m freestyle, which briefly scrambled her senses and irreversibly changed her world, Adlington was asked to describe what it was like to win a gold medal. She acted just like most of us would, spouting excited cliches such as: \"It feels great, I can't believe it, I'm over the moon!\", and grinning wildly. She had little time to contextualise before being shepherded off the stage to make way for the American men's 4x100m relay team.</p> <p>This afternoon, however, we were able to meet Adlington in a scrunchier, more informal setting. Hacks who didn't know who she was 48 hours ago crowded busily around her, asking about boyfriends and domestic arrangements, fast cars and Jimmy Choos. It took all of 30 seconds for her to have them eating out of her hand.</p> <p>\"Yes, I've still got my Vauxhall Corsa but I really want to change it for an Audi A3,\" she sighed. \"Even though Jeremy Clarkson slagged them off as chavvy I don't care. I also like the BMW1 series - Dan Davies has one so I'm aiming high.\"</p> <p>She was just as honest when asked about her victory, saying: \"I saw Katie Hoff go at 250m and I thought: 'Oh gosh, she's gone'. I just tried to stay with Jo [Jackson]. I was so tired. But in the last 50m I thought 'right, go!' and it paid off.\"</p> <p>\"To be on the podium with my best friend was just incredible,\" she added. \"And to hear the Great Britain team looking down on me and singing the national anthem - badly! - was just great. When Jo and I walked into the team meeting everyone stood up and applauded.</p> <p>\"For someone like Mark Foster, who has competed in five Olympic Games, to do that was unbelievable. I've had the gold medal on all afternoon. I even wore it to dinner and when I was on the internet.\" The homeliness didn't end there: she revealed that when she phoned home all she heard were screams from her parents and two sisters as they passed the phone to one another and back again.</p> <p>Interviewing sports stars is often a torturous business: they are cynical and suspicious and have PhDs in media training. They believe we are going to stitch them up; occasionally they are right.</p> <p>Today though was different. Everyone was on the same side. For me the most touching and revealing moment of all came after the interview had ended. As the rest of the press pack shuffled out of the mixed zone, Anita Lonsbrough - the last British lady to win an Olympic gold back in 1960 - walked up to Adlington and told her: \"I was in tears for you, I was so happy!\" Immediately they chatted away like ordinary folk, like you and me.</p> <p>\"You know I thought I'd lost it, I always lose those close ones,\" Adlington replied. \"I was convinced that I had [Federica] Pellegrini yesterday and I didn't. And I thought Hoff had got me today too. I was so glad to be wrong.\" Their brief chat ended with a hug and Lonsbrough telling Adlington: \"Well done and enjoy the moment - it's been too long.\"</p> <p>There won't be much time for that, not yet anyway. There's the 4x200m freestyle relay and the 800m freestyle to look forward to, and the possibility of two more gold medals too. Her life will never be normal again, but hopefully that's all that will change.</p>",

Eggs cost almost a third more - \u00a32.58 instead of last year's \u00a31.95 for a dozen medium free-range eggs. </p> <p>Global grain prices have been driven up by increasing demand in recent months, pushing up the cost of meat and dairy products as feeding livestock costs more, while high fuel costs mean transporting products is also far more expensive. </p> <p>Johnny Stern, managing director of mysupermarket.co.uk, said: \"This month we have seen the highest annual price increase on the staples basket since April this year. This indicates that shoppers need to keep an even closer eye on what they're spending.</p> <p>\"Shopping habits are changing. Consumers are more cash-conscious and consequently, despite the overall price increases, there are a wide range of offers available in each store. This means that discerning shoppers can beat these rises and be smart about the way in which they shop.\"</p>",

  "<p>This credit crunch business is no fun at all - the cutbacks, the saving, the generally having no fun and not being able to afford to go down the pub. It's worse than being a student. And then, just to really top things off, there are the annoying people who spout non-stop thrifty advice without pausing for one second to see if you need it.</p> <p>These are the kind of people who take one look at your shopping bags and issue a sharp intake of breath. Shop-bought pies? High-street clothes? Spray bottles of cleaning stuff? Why are you buying those when you could make them for a fraction of the price?</p> <p>Well, maybe in the olden days. But does that really hold true now? Are thousands of convenience addicts just a few money-saving tips away from beating the credit crunch? Can making my own chicken pie really be the answer to all my financial needs?</p> <p>Certainly, we buy many more things ready prepared now than we ever have before. \"Demands on time have got tougher and more people are in the workforce,\" says Jonathan Schroeder, professor of marketing at the University of Exeter. \"The idea is that convenience products will save us time so we can have time for social activities or seeing the people we want to.\"</p> <p>On this basis, you might expect buying something ready-made to be more expensive than doing it yourself - if you are saving your time, you are presumably paying for someone else's. And there are some products that definitely fall into this category: ready-sliced green beans, for instance, will always be more expensive than whole ones. Which in turn, of course, are more expensive than growing your own. But how will the chicken pie fare?</p> <h2>Fowl play</h2> <p>I don't grow my own chickens, so I hop off to the supermarket (yes, I know the market would have been cheaper, but it shuts before I even leave work). Sainsbury's family chicken pie retails at \u00a32.35 and feeds three to four. Having rifled through Nigella and found a pretty straightforward chicken pie recipe, I start assembling ingredients. The basket fills up to the tune of \u00a310.09 - plain flour, 44p; butter, 85p; milk, 80p; frozen peas, \u00a31.06; free-range chicken breasts, \u00a34.68; cooked ham, \u00a32.26. So much for being thrifty.</p> <p>Back home, I start cooking. And continue cooking. Even with some hardcore multitasking it still takes more than an hour before the pie goes in the oven. Granted, one doesn't have pie all the time - it's a jolly treat for weekend lunch, perhaps (and considering the amount of butter Nigella has me adding, a good job too), but it's a significant time investment.</p> <p>There's also the problem of my bomb-site kitchen to tackle. Time to test how well a home-made kitchen cleaner performs. Out goes the Ecover squirty stuff at \u00a31.98 for 500ml, and in comes the vinegar, soda crystals, bicarbonate of soda and lemons. The cost? \u00a32.05. A few pence more but a great deal more cleaning kit bought - enough to do probably twice the area of the shop-bought bottle. That's almost half price. If it works.</p> <p>Which, surprisingly, it does. You need to put in a bit more effort, but the cleaning doesn't take any longer, and the wild fizzing of vinegar and bicarb is a welcome distraction from the scrubbing. The sink gleams like never before. Thrifty and effective. I sink into a smug glow that is made all the more self-satisfied by the emergence of my pie from the oven.</p> <p>Admittedly, it cost more than four times the price of a ready-made shop pie. But, while my splurging on ingredients hasn't made me any better off, it has made my pie a great deal more delicious. And, in fact, enormous. There's far more pie than in the shop-bought version - enough to feed at least eight - and it's about 900% better quality (there isn't any palm oil in there for a start, nor any vegetable concentrate).</p> <p>Of course, if I was a truly thrifty cook my costs for this pie would have been different. I bought all the ingredients from scratch - to properly save money I would have used leftover meat from a roast earlier in the week, and my flour, milk and eggs would have been cheaper because I'd have bought them in larger quantities. I'd also have reduced the time I spent on the project by making several pastry-based dishes at the same time. Maybe you can make a decent quality chicken pie for less than \u00a32.35, but only if you plan properly.</p> <h2>Time tariff</h2> <p>Which is where I play my trump card (of sorts). Because, actually, I'm already into sewing. I have two machines, a load of thread and a stash of material. Running up a quick t-shirt? Surely I can do it for less money than it would cost to buy it. Except, well, maybe not. The price of clothes on the high street has, thanks mainly to Primark and the supermarkets, actually fallen.</p> <p>Even though I'm only paying \u00a34.50 for my fabric, once you take into account the cost of making a mock-up (or buying a pattern), and a percentage of the costs of my machines, threads and sundries, you can still buy tops more cheaply. Mine might not unravel at the hem on its first wear, but it also took several hours of my time to make.</p> <p>And this brings us to the crunch question: how do I price my spare time? Of my three potentially thrifty enterprises, only making my own cleaning products cost less and didn't take up any extra time. Both the pie and the t-shirt, while being better quality than many ready-made counterparts, cost considerably more and involved me putting in some graft.</p> <p>So how much is my free time worth? Not so much that I mind taking 15 minutes to whizz up a big batch of hummus or make a couscous salad to take for lunch. But enough to take pastry making off my to-do list except for on special occasions, and save the sewing for things that are out of the ordinary.</p> <p>Which doesn't mean I'll stop cooking or stitching. Because it's not all about the money - if it was I could spend those extra hours working part time in a bar rather than trying to shave a few pence off the cost of a supermarket chicken pie. Certainly, my bank account would be in better shape if I did.</p>",
  "<p>Hands up if you're already <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=bored+with+the+olympics&amp;btnG=Google+Search\">bored by the Olympics</a>? Is that everybody (apart from the weak orangey drink sipping nerds at the back, obviously)? Good. Then let the alternate games begin. My mate Ted - a Philadelphian, a chiropractor and a keen rugby player - is boycotting the Olympics to protest the domestic and foreign policies of the People's Republic of China. Instead Ted and his extended family will be holding their own Wii Olympics in Ted's sister's living room. \"Probably at about four in the morning,\" says Ted.</p> <p>But Ted's family Wiilympics are just the tip of an <a href=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1163/529979355_e9438a67a1.jpg?v=0\">alternative Olympics iceberg</a>. All over the world people are holding or have held alternate events for reasons ranging from disgust at <a href=\"http://www.babelgum.com/122814/afp-tibetans-stage-alternative-olympics-22-may.htm\">China's policies in Darfur and Tibet</a> to the excuse to stage a pointedly apolitical global knit-in. Or - in the case of the whacky, zany, goofy, off-the-freakin'-scale hilarious MTV's <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6398/is_200704/ai_n25580980\">The Games</a> - an attempt to destroy over 20,000 years of human civillisation and replace it with a kegger-fuelled nightmare dude-culture composed entirely of shaven-chested American boy-men who are proud of the fact that they have never read a book, getting drunk and shouting and having hot, steamy, drunken and painfully clumsy sex with not very bright American women in hot tubs. Just like everything else on MTV.</p> <p>North Korea is staging into own alternative Olympics this week in the shape of its <a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10525346&amp;ref=rss\">\"mass games\"</a>. The Mongolians will be racing around doing crazy stuff on ponies, because <a href=\"http://www.gluckman.com/Naadam.html\">that's what they do every year</a> anyway.

In the interests of full exposure, I ought to reveal that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/14/popandrock.stevenwells\">I am universally hated</a> by a <a href=\"http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/articles/16125\">global \"alternative\" knitting community</a> that seems to be largely comprised of entirely <a href=\"http://www.philaweekly.com/?inc=article&amp;id=404&amp;x=raveling-in-it&amp;_c=a-e--a-e-feature\">cranky</a>, <a href=\"http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/articles/16367\">humourless</a>, hobby fascists and <a href=\"http://worldnews.about.com/b/2008/07/20/knit-a-dictator.htm\">petulant knit Nazis</a>.</p> <p>Nonetheless I must confess to be utterly confused as to the purpose of the Knitting Olympics. They protest nothing. They offer as an alternative to sitting on your fat backside and watching the Olympics, the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/67189100@N00/2516320175/\">stupendously pointless exercise</a> of sitting on your fat backside and <a href=\" http://smariek.blogspot.com/2008/07/knitting-olympic-trials.html\">knitting something</a> while watching the Olympics. \"The goal of the Ravelympics,\" says one Knitting Olympics website, \"is to pick an item to cast on during the opening ceremonies that will be a challenge to knit during the 17 days of Olympic competition and [to] complete [it] by the extinguishing of the flame during the closing ceremonies.\"</p> <p>Seriously. <a href=\"http://bitsofyarn.wordpress.com/2008/07/24/knitting-olympics/\">That's it</a>.

Which is some kind of awesome.</p> <p>But wait, it turns out this story has a political bent after all. The <a href=\"http://www.dose.ca/toronto/news/story.html?s_id=iNwE06xPFIulUlEfNg7uJSBEyg%2B3s9zz%2FFcXFMWtewpmhyhtec57zw%3D%3D\">first knitting Olympics</a> took place during the 2006 winter Olympics <br>but founder and organiser Stephanie Pearl-McPhee - aka the <a href=\"http://www.yarnharlot.ca/blog\">Yarn Harlot</a> - says she's boycotting Beijing 'cos the Chinese government are a bunch of bastards. \"I'm not so keen on taking part in an Olympics hosted by China within the context of their current human rights issues,\" she says. Which makes the organisers of the current knitting Olympics not only boring but also a bunch of dirty rotten, sticking-a-knife-in-the-back-of-the-knitting-community scabs and knit traitors.</p> <p>But leaving the dirty scabs aside, while some knitters are showing their disgust at China's terrible human rights record by <em>not</em> knitting during the Olympics, others (says <a href=\"http://yarnscoop.com/?tag=the-color-orange\">yarnscoop.com</a>) \"urge a more active form of protest\" like knitting orange things for <a href=\"http://www.thecolororange.net/uk/\">The Color Orange</a> protest project. All of which sort of begs the question - could competitive knitting ever become a serious sport worthy of consideration for inclusion in the proper Olympics in its own right? To which the answer is - dude, it already is.</p> <p>For some time the crazed and stupid ear-flapped Tibetan style hand-knitted hat-wearing \"sick kids\" of the strange and dangerous world of <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB119766934184930123-lMyQjAxMDE3OTE3NzYxNjc5Wj.html\">Xtreme knitting</a>, have been pushing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yst6hc0kLzE\">the craft</a> to its <a href=\"http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/06/extreme_knittin.php\">twisted extremes</a> at events like <a href=\"http://sockapaloozafour.blogspot.com/\">Sockapalooza</a> and <a href=\"http://pepperknit.com/blog/archives/category/socktoberfest\">Socktoberfest</a> which, on further investigation, just seem to be <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6Hc8MdTSQ\">more instances of people sat on their fat arses</a> at home, knitting. Probably while watching the Olympics. Which, if you'll excuse me, is what I'm off to do. Now where did I put my needles and my pattern for a giant orange 'Support Tibet's return to theocratic feudalism!' flag?</p>",

  "<p>As Russian columns <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/georgia.russia3\">advance</a> into Georgia proper, columns in the American press fill with dire warnings and withering contempt for anyone so puerile as to ever trust a Russian. George Bush's infamous glimpse into Putin's soul failed to recognise what nostalgic cold warriors have always insisted was pinned to his sleeve: a heart that beats for lost imperial glory, and a ruthless ambition to match. Blogging at the Weekly Standard, John Noonan describes the Georgia conflict as the consequence of \"<a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/Weblogs/TWSFP/TWSFPView.asp\">Chamberlain-esque conflict aversion</a>\". National Review's Jonah Goldberg cries <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmUxYzA5ZjRiZjYxMzRiNTIyZTJmMTBkNDIwYWRlYjI=\">that</a> \"this is what happens\" when the west takes its eye off the Russians to enjoy the Olympics. </p> <p>\"This\", of course, is the brutalisation of a hapless, innocent, fledgling democracy \u2013 a role played to the hilt by Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, who has spared no absurdity in his increasingly haggard efforts to trigger a western bailout of his hasty and ill-advised weekend invasion of long-autonomous <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4485527.ece\">South Ossetia</a>. </p> <p>Saakashvili's overheated rhetoric \u2013 \"If the whole world does not stop Russia,\" <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUSL768040420080808\">he has remarked</a>, \"then Russian tanks will be able to reach any other European capital\" \u2013 is illustrative of the kind of feverish thinking that is sure to transform a regional crisis into a global one. But where the frustrated desperation that Saakashvili has brought upon himself seems to explain his descent into hyperbole, American commentators have no such excuse. The real wake-up call placed by the Russo-Georgian conflict is not a clarion to a new cold war, but a head check for pro-democracy ideologues \u2013 whose idealism has ratified a style of sloppy thinking and rote sloganeering that actually threatens the durability of representative government around the world.</p> <p>The anti-Russia lobby is giving the pro-Israel lobby a run for its money, hyping the settling of scores among two European, Orthodox Christian countries as more dangerous to the peace and security of the west than any clash of civilisations or jihad ever was. Casting this conflict as a 9/11-style litmus test of patriotism and humanity, New Criterion editor <a href=\"http://pajamasmedia.com/rogerkimball/\">Roger Kimball</a> praises John McCain as a man who \"knows evil and repudiates it\", deriding Barack Obama as one \"crippled by moral relativism\" for daring to admit \"fault on both sides\". For Kimball, Russia, \"uncivilised\" as our terrorist enemies, affords the added menace of a disgruntled ex-superpower hell-bent on \"an imperialist mission\". Meanwhile, at Slate, Anne Applebaum <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2197155/\">balefully warns</a> that Russia may make \"Islamic terrorism\" look like \"the least of our problems\". </p> <p>This will only come true if the west, in a paroxysm of fear and loathing, makes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/russia.georgia\">an enemy of Russia</a> \u2013 which, indeed, would be a far more formidable foe than Iran, Hizbullah, and al-Qaida combined. No strategy against jihad can succeed with Russia aligned actively against the west. But no Russian official has expressed a desire to eradicate Georgia from the face of the earth, or drive the Georgian people into the sea. Nor are motives like these driving an illegal and destabilising Russian nuclear programme. Nor is our friendship with Georgia quite as deep and profound as our friendship with Israel. </p> <p>Despite moans of wishful outrage to the contrary, the small, democratic ally is not a Weberian ideal type or a Platonic form. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/10/AR2008081002311.html?hpid=topnews\">Saakashvili</a> is a deeply imperfect leader, prone to beating his domestic opposition in the streets, and the Georgia he leads is a country that has been fragmented from birth. </p> <p>The anti-Russian reaction obscures the basic particularity of the Georgian situation, and all the history that informs it. These lost, sound judgment in pursuit of even a forthright agenda of assertive democracy promotion becomes impossible. Treating the Georgia we see on the map as if it were as sovereign and whole as the state of Israel, or Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, sets us down a path of danger and confusion. But the pro-democracy ideologues confusing big hearts for big brains make this mistake by design. </p> <p>The fact of the matter is that the territorial integrity of Georgia has been continuously undermined from within since the Abkhazians and South Ossetians first rebelled in the early 1990s. A central contention of the anti-Russian crowd holds that <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4500362.ece\">Georgia today</a> would have been saved, if only the west had the courage to admit the country into Nato at once. But Nato membership was in large part imagined to smooth Georgia's reassertion of sovereignty in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In short, the integrity of Nato was to be gambled on precisely the sort of move Saakashvili has just engineered to such catastrophic effect \u2013 and on the odds that Russia would abandon its citizens in those territories to frank and open aggression. How democratic.</p> <p>Another talking point advanced relentlessly by the anti-Russians proclaims, per Saakashvili, \"today Georgia, tomorrow the world\". The editors of the Washington Post have <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/08/AR2008080802741.html?hpid=opinionsbox1\">railed that</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The principles at stake, including sovereignty and territorial integrity, apply well beyond the Caucasus. To abandon Georgia and its fragile democratic Rose Revolution would send a terrible signal to other former Soviet and Warsaw Pact republics that to Moscow's dismay have achieved or are working toward democracy and fully independent foreign policies. </p> </blockquote> <p>Would that these sacrosanct principles had applied to Serbia, which fought on just those grounds to keep Kosovo an integral part of its recognised territory. But the west recognised that European integration and American good faith would both have been profoundly damaged by stiffing the Kosovans; and in a sound calculation that combined realpolitik with democratic principle, Kosovo was recognised as an independent state of the sort that, soon, Russia will be recognising Abkhazia and Ossetia as. Indeed, it is hard to see how the Georgian taste for democracy is any weaker than the Kosovan, or how the fate of Abkhazia and Ossetia affects the fate of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, or the Baltics \u2013 long-sovereign nation-states without ungovernable autonomous regions, and Nato members to boot. </p> <p>The fact remains that even if Russia were to squander its advantages and foolishly conquer all of Georgia, the consolidation of democratic, representative government on mainland Europe would be unaffected. American foreign policy, however, would not be. As much as we must work not to make an enemy of Russia, we cannot rule out the possibility that Russia, in its zeal to teach Georgia a lesson it will never forget, may be willing to risk making an enemy of America. Given the jingoism coming from American quarters, Russia enjoys, as is its wont, plausible grounds for appealing to the simple logic of tit for tat. </p> <p>The natural response is the firm but fair stance taken up by Barack Obama and the Bush administration \u2013 cognisant of the complex of blame in the Caucasus, but adamant that Russia not devastate Georgia without consequence. The alternative, typified by the anti-Russian caucus present within the McCain campaign and the American commentariat, is to romanticise Georgia and demonise Russia out of all proportion \u2013 not so dreadful, as election-year shenanigans go, but for the most imprudent and destructive policy that must follow upon it.</p>",
  "<p>Whether team GB hits its target of bringing home 41 medals from the Olympic games will depend on more than just the talent and hard work of the athletes. Winning at the top level also means having the most advanced kit and the best training strategies.</p> <p>In the run-up to the games ministers were keen to point out that the government had put far more money into elite sport compared with previous Olympics. Since 2004, top athletes and their coaches have received \u00a3265m, compared with \u00a384m ahead of the Athens games and \u00a363m before Sydney.</p> <p>Whether that will translate into more medals remains to be seen, but much of this money has gone into developing new technologies that should give British athletes the edge over the competition.</p> <h2>Training</h2> <p>Competitors will be eyeing up their rivals for advances in the equipment they use \u2013 more aerodynamic bikes, more powerful kayak paddles and the like. But many of the technological advantages will be invisible once the events start. </p> <p>\"The biggest gains are certainly in the training period,\" said Dr Scott Drawer, research and innovation consultant with UK Sport. He has been funding university scientists and companies to develop technologies that will allow coaches to assess the performance of their athletes more accurately and more quickly so that they can give more effective feedback. \"Developing measurement technologies to understand how people perform is an absolutely fundamental part of coaching,\" he said.</p> <p>His researchers have borrowed innovations from Formula One, aircraft design and the defence industry and have made a particular impact in kayaking, rowing and sailing. For example they have fitted miniature sensors to kayak paddles and rowing blades to measure the force applied in each stroke. That information can be combined with accurate data on the boat's speed from a GPS sensor.</p> <p>\"By putting all those sensors together you get a really accurate picture of how an individual is performing. You can then relay that information in real time to a coach ... and they can see, for example, what the athlete is doing and how they can change their technique,\" said Drawer. Much of the innovation has come in the software to combine the information in real time.</p> <h2>Diving</h2> <p>Another sport where new training aids could make a difference is diving. Previously, competitors practised new, more complicated dives over a trampoline. But the step up to doing it for real in the pool was a large one. Getting a new dive wrong could result in a belly-flop and a serious injury.</p> <p>To prevent this, researchers have developed a harness worn by the diver that is attached to the ceiling of the training pool. The harness gives them the freedom to perform twists and somersaults, but by holding the other end of the ropes the coach can control the diver's descent and slow them down if necessary. The harnesses have been used at elite diving centres in Sheffield, Southampton, Plymouth and Leeds.</p> <p>The harnesses were built by Dr Dave Richards, team leader in engineering design at Fraser Nash Consultancy. He said the device helps the athlete learn the feel of the dive more safely. \"It's for when you are first learning and you are trying to visualise what you are going to see,\" he said. \"It is to help the athlete learn orientation as they are doing the dive.\"</p> <p>The difficult part was fitting the harnesses. \"The challenge for us was putting them up in swimming pools that weren't designed to take them,\" he said. That meant using corrosion-proof, lightweight materials.</p> <h2>Heat adaptation</h2> <p>Although Beijing's 32C to 33C is positively balmy compared with the raging heat of Athens, adapting to the conditions is vital for athletes in every event. More difficult to deal with at these games is the 70% humidity which means that the body's natural mechanism of evaporative cooling via sweating is less effective. </p> <p>\"We are looking at other ways other than evaporative heat loss to remove heat from the body,\" said Prof Mike Tipton, an expert in human physiology at the University of Portsmouth who has been working with the Olympic team. </p> <p>At its most trivial this means pre-cooling kit, for example the protective clothing that fencing competitors wear during a bout, by putting it in a freezer. Other strategies include ice vests, cold hand baths and clothing containing cooled water or glycol. Another strategy is to help athletes acclimatise to the heat in advance by training in an environment that mimics the heat and humidity they will experience on the big day.</p> <p>Improvements in one aspect of a sport, for example reducing drag by changing the shape of a cycling helmet, might cause other problems, perhaps because the new design retains more heat. </p> <p>\"The aerodynamics, particularly in the cycling events and triathlon events, can make quite a significant difference to the amount of effort that's expended,\" said Tipton, \"but if the cost of that is that body temperature reaches the level at which heat exhaustion is likely then it is not a trade-off you are going to accept.\" Tipton has been involved in assessing other new equipment to check it will not affect the athletes' physiological performance.</p> <h2>Cycling</h2> <p>Team GB hopes to boost its cycling performance from the four medals won in Athens to six this time around. Most of the innovations to the bikes are top secret to stop other teams copying them. Only the competitors and a small group of engineers and scientists \u2013 whom Drawer calls the \"secret squirrels\" \u2013 know what they are.</p> <p>One training aid that has been revealed, though, is a more sophisticated cycling simulator or \"ergometer\" that can be more easily tailored to different cyclists to give a realistic ride while remaining stationary in the lab or in the training room. \"It is very adjustable to different people, but it also much better mimics the track cycling event,\" said Richards.</p> <p>The innovation was to include a large flywheel with a fan in it that mimics the change in resistance that a cyclist experiences during acceleration. Because the ergometer always reacts in the same way \u2013 unlike cycling on the track which might be affected by different air pressure or temperature \u2013 the cyclist and coach can accurately compare the effect of different training regimes or acceleration strategies.</p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Tuesday August 12 2008. We meant to accredit Dr Scott Drawer to UK Sport, not Sport England. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>When I was a history student in the sixties some lecturer assured us that all the European empires of the modern era were crumbling fast with the exception of the two which had expanded across land, not sea: Russia and the United States.</p> <p>Leaving aside the reasonable speculation that the Chinese flag may one day fly over Hawaii, things haven't quite turned out that way for Russia, have they?</p> <p>To my great astonishment the Tsarist/Soviet empire fell rapidly apart after 1989. When Georgia seceded from the Soviet Union in the remarkable year of 1991 it was only the sixth item on the BBC TV evening news - itself a remarkable fact.</p> <p>What should the west do now that <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/georgia.russia7\">Russia is reasserting its revived power</a> on the periphery of its core state, the so-called \"near abroad\"? Reading the weekend press there is a pleasing - do I mean alarming? - disparity of views.</p> <p>The Telegraph flexes its cold war muscles and sounds hawkish. The Mail and Times chide the American-educated <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikheil_Saakashvili \">Mikhail Saakashvili</a>, \"Rose Revolution\" president of Georgia since 2003, for his reckless belief that he could reassert his authority over South Ossetia without provoking the kind of Russian response we are now watching from afar.</p> <p>Did Moscow lure the excitable Saakashvili (he has been on the news channels a lot since Friday) into a trap, whereby it could consolidate its hold on South Ossetia and the other pro-Russian enclave of Abkhazia? Or was the Georgian advance a half-baked shambles in which Saakashvili had actually hoped to be at the Olympics like everyone else (except Gordon)? </p> <p>Today's Guardian runs a mix of opinion. <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/georgia.russia4 \">Jonathan Steele</a>, a specialist in this field for 40 years, dismisses the oil pipeline dimension as marginal (I'm inclined to agree, as I was over Iraq's oil) and puts the dispute in the wider context of US-led western efforts to reduce Russian influence throughout the region.</p> <p>Jonathan blames the \"hot-headed\" Saakashvili for over-reaching himself and thinking he has more claims on Nato and the EU's support in this far border corner of Europe and Asia than is warranted. Even George Bush urged \"peaceful resolution\" of Georgia's historic conflicts when he popped up in Tbilisi.</p> <p>Further into the paper, <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/russia.georgia\">David Clark</a>, a former adviser to Robin Cook, tilts the other way. Whatever his faults Saakashvili is no Milosevic (that's true) and deserves some diplomatic support. The west should sanction Putin's Russia - it's still Putin's, isn't it ? - if it tries to annexe sovereign territory, for instance by asking the IOC to reconsider nearby Sochi as a suitable base for the winter Olympics of 2014.</p> <p>The way I read <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/georgia.russia \">the paper's editorial</a>, it is more Steele than Clark. Russia has lost whatever moral high ground it had by bombing civilians and frightened its other \"near abroad\" neighbours, notably Ukraine, which has been squabbling with Moscow too and is well-placed to make trouble for the Russian Black Sea fleet if it is deployed.</p> <p>But the big loser is Saakashvili, whose EU critics - notably France and Germany - will now say they were right to resist UK-supported US pressure to admit Georgia to Nato and the EU. He speaks perfect English and, even making allowances for stress, I've learned not to trust all he says in the past few days.</p> <p>Myself, I've always had some sympathy with Russian complaints about being \"encircled\" by the US as Nato and the EU expanded into the former Soviet bloc. Eastern Europe, OK, those states were part of a Europe divided by the settlement of 1945. No one recognised the 1940 Soviet annexation of the Baltic states. </p> <p>But Russia's southern flank - the so-called \"stans\" - you could see why they felt humiliated and nervous. All that stuff about missile bases to cover Iran from Poland and the Czech Republic, oh really? </p> <p>On the other hand, neither camp in Fleet Street seems to dispute that the Russians have been stirring it up in the two enclaves for several years, moving in troops, shooting down drones and worse. So I am disinclined to see Russia and its Ossetian allies as mere victims of a foolish move from Tbilisi - Joe Stalin's birthplace, incidentally, in case anyone forgot.</p> <p>Will the Russians merely uphold the status quo, now the Georgians are pulling back? Will they organise a breakaway plebiscite, again using the anti-Serb, anti-Slav precedent of Kosovo since 1998 as their justification? Will they seek to use the inevitable backlash at home against Saakashvili to replace him with a more obliging local? </p> <p>What would the Yanks have done in their backyard, in Mexico or - more recently - in Haiti or (failed) Venezuela? It's worth asking, though it's also fair pointing out that abuses by US-backed states, Israel for example, get young westerners out on the streets in protest faster than abuses out of Asia. Think Lebanon, August 2006.</p> <p>My hunch is that, in its present assertive mood Moscow will risk pushing hard, not least to remind the west not to push too hard the other way. As in most such disputes - Iraq included - a mixture of motives, local and global, are in play. No one wants to miscalculate, this being the sort of crisis where \"Sarajevo 1914\" is more often invoked than \"Munich 1938\".</p> <p>But it's risky. Everyone feels nervous and a bit threatened. China's pyrotechnic Olympic opening ceremony - against which the Ossetian drama unfolded, confusingly at times (are they fireworks or rockets on TV?) - will not have made Moscow or Washington feel very relaxed this August. They have seen the future - and it works, at least when it comes to mass mobilisation.</p> <p>Many people seem to have adored the Beijing ceremony. I found it a bit scary, the sheer scale of it looking more like CGI images (those drummers?) than real-life Chinese at several points. By unhappy coincidence it all came in the week <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn\">Alexander Solzhenitsyn</a> died which prompted the Economist to lecture us all - Russians, Chinese, liberal westerners - against being complacent towards tyranny.</p> <p>Where are the new generation of Solzhenitsyns among Russia's famed intelligentsia, it asked? Bought off by privileges, the comforts of revived nationalism and by flattery (so was Solzhenitsyn towards the end), it suggests. Ditto in China where new-found opportunities for free speech have not generated a more liberal regime. Is that fair? Several weekend reports suggest internal criticism of the vulgarity, chauvinism and cost of Friday's ceremony in the Bird's Nest stadium. Good.</p> <p>As for us, our collective willingness to speak truth to power against authoritarianism and abuse seems to atrophy gently as its moral clarity erodes. The product of affluence, the decline of a shared moral or religious code? Or am I being too pessimistic?</p>",

  "<p><br>Chilli peppers. Photograph: Helen Rimell</p> <p>The veg garden goddess reminded me today of the time, a good many years ago now, when a big-time American magazine sent us to Naples to investigate the use of chillies in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_cuisine\">Neapolitan cuisine</a>. We found chillies everywhere except in the food. </p> <p>Every shop seemed to sell them, even some that didn't sell any other food. There were wreaths of them in greengrocers' shops, and bunches of them hanging in restaurants and attached to buildings that had nothing at all to do with food. Most disconcertingly, there was usually a bunch of chillies carved into a stone or wood panel in the dozens of <a href=\"http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/mischurches03.htm\">churches</a> we visited - and some had actual bunches of dried red chillies somewhere near the entrance to the church. </p> <p>The ubiquity of the chilli finally persuaded us that there was a symbolism we were missing and, as it was Naples, we concluded that the chillies were a talisman against the <a href=\"http://www.luckymojo.com/evileye.html\">evil eye</a>. I can't remember whether we ever managed to confirm this in any properly scholarly way but, as a theory, it had the virtue of explaining all our sightings of chillies - and in principle was certainly falsifiable.</p> <p>I love chillies almost as much as I hate unpeeled bell peppers. We've got a great relationship with chillies, as we've grown them - in the open, not under glass - for so long that our first endeavour might even have been AGW; ante-global-warming. Mind you, two sides of our kitchen garden are walled, and the side that would otherwise be exposed to the Siberian winds has a (<a href=\"http://www.ehow.com/how_2187472_prune-leyland-cyprus.html\">very nicely pruned</a>, thank you) tall leyland cyprus hedge. </p> <p>Still, we do negotiate with the local nursery to germinate and pot on our chilli seeds. In the past we've grown <a href=\"http://www.thechilligarden.co.uk/hungarian-wax-chilli-peppers.html\">Hungarian wax</a>, <a href=\"http://www.littlegreenmen.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=112&amp;Itemid=9\">padr\u00f3n</a>, <a href=\"http://www.chileseeds.co.uk/hot_chili_pepper_seeds_5.htm\">jalape\u00f1o</a>, serrano and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_pepper\">bird's eye</a> chillies, and had successful crops from each of them. I know the gardeners amongst you will call me a liar, but I promise it's true. </p> <p>There is a \"however\" coming, though. Our chillies, while not quite heat-less, are never exactly hot. Global warming or no, I don't think the weather has really ever been hot enough for long enough to make the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale\">Scovilles</a> soar. But I count this an advantage, as our chillies all have the distinctive flavours of their varieties, without the shrivelling <a href=\"http://www.fiery-foods.com/Dave/capsaicin.asp\">capsaicin</a> heat hit you get from the ones you buy. </p> <p>Any of ours can be fried in olive oil and consumed as is, flaked with Maldon salt; sliced or chopped they add real interest and depth to pasta dishes, soups and stews - and they don't bite back if eaten raw. They are fantastic pickled, and mild enough to use in scrambled egg with garlic or spring onion and fresh coriander. We dry the surplus every year - whereupon they go bright red. I crumble one into almost any savoury dish to which I'd add black pepper.</p> <p>This year we forgot to take our seed to the nursery in time, and had simply to buy whatever they had germinated. I picked the first one in mid-July; I think it was a serrano, about 15cm long, pointy and flecked with chocolate-coloured streaks as it ripened. </p> <p>What else would you do with these lovely mild chillies? My wife has made chilli jam in the past, and I've added a dried one to poached pears.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Bonjour. The small fourth-innings chase is one of cricket's more fascinating elements. At the best of times sport is perhaps 10% talent and 90% mind \u2013 were it the other way round Mark Ramprakash would have 11,023 runs @ 45.62 from 17 years of Test cricket \u2013 but in these situations that balance moves even further towards it being a mind game. When you are chasing under 200, with time no object, you know you will win nine times out of 10 (or four times if you're Australian) but you know that the tenth instance will cause embarrassment, humiliation and, as Thom Yorke once said, bruises that won't heal.</p> <p>Basically, you've done the hard work. You've engaged that attractive lady/boy with an opening line that's nowhere near as good as you think it is; you've made your job and indeed yourself sound ten times more interesting than they are, perhaps hinting tantalisingly at a fascinating ocean of melancholy just beneath the surface; with the aid of umpteen snifters of Strong Drink, you've held eye contact for at least 0.01 seconds longer than would be appropriate in a less sexually charged environment; you've only gone and got that ladyboy to invite you back to theirs!</p> <p>And now you can only Costanza it. You can only say, no thanks, you don't like coffee at this hour because it keeps you awake; you can only say something wildly inappropriate about tranvestisism, not knowing that their father has only just this last week undergone the change; you can only mispronounce Leffe as 'Leff-ay' and find out that, with the exception of George Lamb, this annoys them more than anything else in the entire world; you can only struggle miserably with that strap; you can only inexplicably confuse the word 'prophylactic' with 'ptedoractyl' when asking them if they have protection; you can only be told the taxi is on its way.</p> <p>It's a whole different kind of pressure, basically, and to blow it can be damaging stuff. Same goes for the fourth-innings collapse, which can impact upon a player, a generation of players, or even an entire sporting nation. Australia would not rid themselves of <a href=\"http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/63291.html\">Headingley 81</a> for over a quarter of a century, until Shane Warne decided to remake The Exorcist as an arthouse sport movie; Damien Martyn did not play another Test for six years after slapping one to cover in <a href=\"http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/63629.html\">Sydney 94</a>; England have been going in one direction since the unfathomable horror of <a href=\"http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/225443.html\">Multan 05</a> when, having played with the most splendid authority for four days in the first post-Ashes Test, they fell in a heap on the final day. It was a result that at the time felt like a blip but was actually the beginning of the end.</p> <p>That was actually one of only two occasions in the last 30 years in which England have lost when chasing a fourth-innings total of under 200 (by way of comparison Australia have failed eight times in the same time) but both, like today's involved a target in the nervous 190s: in the other, in Trinidad in 1993-94, they didn't even make <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMn4bhi-KU\">a quarter of the target of 94</a>. By rights they really should win today on a pitch that apparently remains largely blameless: but in the fourth innings of a Test, as in the third part of a horror trilogy, all bets are off.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Don't pick your nose, at least not in public.

Others will say, show me a dead-rubber win and I'll show you a dead rubber. I say deliver me from Swedish furniture.</p> <p>Meanwhile, here's an email.</p> <p>\"I've a feeling that if Strauss goes early, MP Vaughan will be on the plane to India, but if Strauss hangs around for 60-odd, I can't see Vaughan having enough cricket to build his case for a tour. England surely won't take Vaughan and Strauss to India - it would be Gatting and Gooch to Aus all over again.\" The combined ages are slightly different - 77 to 64 from memory, and one of them can be hidden in the slips this time - but I take your point. For me it has to be Vaughan: better player and complements Cook perfectly, both as right-hander and initiative-seizer.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Another link</strong> James Dart and Scott 'Dulux' Murray have a book coming out based on the weekly column, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbooks.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10401_25501_132806_100_38603_38603_category_\">the Knowledge</a>, which, if it's anywhere near as good as said column, should be well worth some of your beer tokens.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 4-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 0, Cook 4)</strong> It's Ntini to finish the over he began yesterday evening, and Cook pulls him with crisp authority for four. Nice shot. I like the way Cook is moving his game on ever so slowly: in this series his strike rate in Tests is, I believe, behind only those of Broad, Bell and Pietersen, and he is pulling more often and with more class.</p> <p>Steve Hudson is on something, and I like it. \"Sir Geoffrey Boycott was mesmerising yesterday on TMS. Balanced, courteous, incisive, succinct, charitable: he was none of these things, but compulsive listening nevertheless. It's sounding more and more like a drunk driving a car with Aggers and Polly as passengers in the back, trying to grab the keys, on the verge of screaming for it all to end. Pin your ears back today.\" I won't heard a bad word against Boycott. I'll hear <em>the</em> bad word against him, but not <em>a</em> bad word.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 5-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 0, Cook 4)</strong><br>Strauss has pared his game to a ludicrous degree. He only had three shots in the first place, but watching a DVD of the 04-05 tour of South Africa reminds you how outstandingly well he played then. He was absolutely be<em>la</em>bouring the short ball. Now he is a just a sub-Tavare blocker, like a mute who has started editing his thoughts so rigorously that he never shares them. He can't be accommodated any longer in my opinion. In that over he edges Morkel just short of Harris at fourth slip.</p> <p>Here's Ian Copestake. \"Could this the day that will be remembered henceforth by all South Africans as Harris's day, or H-day if you're into the whole brevity thing?\" That's just, like, your opinion man. Actually I am still wondering how Harris managed to hoover up so many wickets against Pakistan. If it was in Salim Malik's day it would make perfect sense, but not now.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 5-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 0, Cook 4)</strong> This is Cook's 33rd Test, and it's hard to think of many players - Trescothick is one; Strauss maybe - who have played as many Tests without being dropped. But not many others. In that over he reaches to drive a wider, fuller delivery from Ntini and is beaten. Smart bowling, that, and it's a maiden.</p> <p>\"Boycott has actually turning in some high quality anti-establishment rhetoric on TMS during the last two ot three Tests,\" says Stephen Wolstencroft. \"He gave the Iraq war a proper seeing to the other week, and yesterday he was decrying the materialistic nature of the modern capitalist world, spurred on by the sudden influx of Sky money into cricket. Pop him in some sandals and hand him a bowl of lentils and he could pass for a Guardianista.\" Does he cheques from the folks as well?</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 9-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Strauss looks horrible here. He's hardly playing a shot and, when he's forced to by a straight, short one from Morkel, he can only loop it straight to where silly point would have been. But he gets off the mark later in the over, working a straight one off his pads through midwicket. Good shot.</p> <p>A wee thought: in an age of a) rotation and b) enlightened attitudes to mental fragility, should England invite Trescothick to play in home Tests only? I'm starting to think that maybe they should, if only for the sake of my sanity.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 9-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Maiden from Ntini. In other news, Paul McMillan shuts me up armed with nothing other than a keen love of statistics and a Cricinfo bookmark. \"Cook's strike rate is 44.6, which is also slower than Collingwood, Harmison and <br>Flintoff. Or in other words the 3rd slowest in the top 9, behind only <br>the soon to be dropped Strauss and Ambrose.\" Ok, so maybe it's this calendar year? I definitely checked it the other day; either that or I dreamt it, the implications of which I don't want to consider in public.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 9-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Strauss does well to leave a big short ball from Morkel. No real threats to England this morning, but the problem with these two is that they can bat for an hour and you've not really gone anywhere. <br> <br>\"I have been advocating the Tresco thing ever since they picked Pattinson - if we are going for special selections, why not bring Banger in for the Ashes series?\" says Rachel Clifton. \"I saw him at Lords the other day and he was looking as good as ever.\" The first thing is that it'll never happen, but I do think it's something that should be considered. Why should his illness be any different to a player who, coincidentally, gets injured before every winter tour? You just get prior warning with this. The key is that you accept cricket is now a squad game rather than a team game. But Geoff Miller said recently he doesn't like the word 'rotation'. This after he had just rotated Paul Collingwood out of the team.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 9-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Cook is done by the Ntini angle again, pushing at and missing a slightly wider length delivery. The next ball keeps a bit lower, and there is just a hint of uneven bounce - but, as Mike Atherton points out, nothing much more than you'd expect on a fifth-day track. Another maiden.</p> <p>\"Boycs' rant on Stamp and Death Duties was a joy to behold last week. He really got stuck into it,\" says Tom Walling. \"I'd like to see him on Newsnight, alongside Paxman, as a summariser. He'd cut through the rubbish. 'My Gran could run this country better than Brown, and she'd do it with a cucumber.' Or is that a Carry On film?\" Boycott ooh-matroning his way through a Carry On film really would be something to behold.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 10-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Strauss is caught off a no-ball! He turned Morkel straight round the corner to the man at leg gully, but Morkel had overstepped by a fair distance. Sickeners come a little more definitive, but not that much.</p> <p>\"It's not exactly the same thing but Dennis Bergkamp's fear of flying meant he was available solely for the home leg of most European matches for Arsenal, which was widely accepted as he was good enough to justify his presence,\" says Michael Hunt, not unreasonably.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 10-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> <br>Wars of attrition can be as enriching as anything in sport. This, it's fair to say, isn't. But England are struggling a little, and Cook is beaten as he has a leaden-footed grope at Ntini. You can arrested for that in some cultures. \"Can these two hang on for the draw do you reckon?\" honks Dave Voss.</p> <p>In lieu of any action, the Sky team are extracting the stuff out of Nasser for his preposterous dismissal against Ntini in 2003, when he flap-hooked him straight up in the air with one foot daintily off the ground.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 11-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> <br>I think this game still has a pulse, but it's not easy to discern. Morkel. Strauss. Maiden. The other thing is that the weather is by no means to hold; it's a bit funky overhead.</p> <p>Luciano Howard utters the Banned Word: 'Adelaide'. But this <em>is</em> similar, even if the context isn't. England learnt nothing from that day and, if anything, have gone further into their shell since.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 20-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 12)</strong> <br>Cook crunches Ntini down the ground for four - he didn't time it particularly well, but that's our quota of runs for the next four overs, so enjoy them; cherish them; <em>love</em> them. Actually there are four more, pulled away beautifully through midwicket off a no-ball. It's a feast!</p> <p>\"Unfortunately,\" says Andy Bradshaw, \"CMJ was saying the other day that Trescothick didn't want to play for England full stop.\" Ah. Case closed, Columbo.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 26-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 5, Cook 16)</strong><br>Morkel is joint top wicket-taker in this series with 15, yet by common consensus he can bowl a lot better. He certainly bowls some utter dross at times, and the first ball of that over, around the wicket to Strauss, is the widest of wides. Strauss then turns one round the corner: he now has 5 from 40 balls. Michael Slater, cry your heart out. Cook then pulls for four; he plays that short so very, very well.</p> <p>\"Bad luck Smyth. Looks like the quicker-scoring Cook is to remain a feature only of your nocturnal imaginings,\" mwah-ha-hahs Tom Lawrence. \"Cook's strike rate for matches starting in 2008: 45.09, behind Harmison, Pietersen, Broad, Bell, Flintoff and Collingwood, and ahead of Ambrose, Strauss, Vaughan and the rest of the bowlers.\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 33-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 12, Cook 16)</strong> Ntini beats Strauss with a gem, a trampolining leg-cutter that just missed the edge of his tentative push. Strauss then plays a very nice shot, driving Ntini pleasantly down the ground for four. He then tucks three more off his pads. It hasn't great to watch, at all, but England are slowly grinding their way into a position of control. Time for a bit of bluster and bull from Andre Nel, I think.</p> <p>\"Surely Harmison should only play home Tests too?\" says Chris Bowden. \"His newfound confidence is likely to be destroyed if he leaves the comforts (sic) of Durham and tours India, and he would risk being dropped for the Ashes.\" You say that, but Harmison actually has a splendid record on the subcontinent, where he has consistently showed an admirable willingness to get his hands dirty. Absurdly, it's in overseas conditions that should favour him - Africa and Australasia - where he has bowled like a drain. His is a much more complex case than many people think.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 39-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 13, Cook 17)</strong><br>South Africa do make a change, but it's Harris rather than Nel or Kallis. The first ball does turn (out of the rough, obviously), but if Harris bowls South Africa to victory today I'll eat my own toenail clippings. Strauss sweeps for one, and then Harris beats Cook and Boucher and England get four byes.</p> <p>\"Afternoon Rob,\" chirps unofficial Laphroaig taster Ian Taylor. \"This Thursday, after 7\u00bd years' selfless mediocrity, I'll be leaving my current employers for pastures new. Since you've left the Guardian on about 37 occasions in the last four years I wonder if you, or any of you readers, have any tips and suggestions as to how to go out in style?\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 48-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 13, Cook 26)</strong> Ntini, indefatigability incarnate even at the age of 78, continues to hustle in, and his first ball, slanted across Cook, zips past his attempted drive. Smart bowling. Cook gets some bat on it later in the over, though, steering successive deliveries to the fence at third man. This is an over too many, even for Ntini.</p> <p>\"Where did the phrase 'bowled like a drain' originate?\" asks Sam Blackledge. \"Maybe we will see an unexpected call up for a top of the range sewage system from Nottinghamshire...\" I thought we did two Tests ago?</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Drinks-break chitter-chatter</strong> <br>\"Is the talent deficit between Rolf and the rest of the SA team about as great a gulf as there has been in cricket?\" says Gary Naylor. \"Reading your colleague Jonathan Wilson's excellent book on the history of football tactics last night, I was reminded of the sensational Brazil 1982 team of Socrates, Eder, Zico etc. Up front, they had the lumbering Serginho - football's Rolf. However, I can't think of any examples from cricket to compare with Ringo, sorry Rolf.\"</p> <p>In football, I'd like to offer the lumbering fool known as Jonathan O'Shea. In cricket, probably not among the regular picks (there are one- or few-cap wonders like Scott Muller, Clybe Butts). Some would say Roger Harper, but he was a half-decent spinner, not to mention the greatest fielder of all-time.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 54-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 13, Cook 31)</strong> <br>\"Catch it\" shouts Harris, as Cook puts him miles away from any fielder and through midwicket for four. Harris really is a total nonentity.</p> <p>\"I have plenty of suggestions as to how Mr Taylor can go out in style, but they would be wasted on a man who cannot manage an evening of drinking without wrecking a perfectly innocent pair of suit trousers,\" says Richard O'Hagan. \"Frankly, the best I can do is to recommend that he avoids his own leaving do like the plague.\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 59-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 18, Cook 31)</strong> <br>Nel is on for Ntini, and Strauss leaves, leaves, leaves - and then tucks one off his pads for a single. Five, in fact, because Amla's unnecessary throw fies away for four overthrows.</p> <p>Iain McCulloch is getting feisty. \"SJ Harmison's 'splendid record in the sub-continent' amounts to 23 wickets at 34.65. I think you should stop eating a whole Stilton before you turn in of an evening, these statistic dreams are becoming ever more extreme.\" You want some McCulloch? A) That's a decent record for a seam bowler on the subcontinent. B) It's a very decent record for a seam bowler who's perceived to be a shi*house on the subcontinent. C) He has bowled better than those figures suggest. Next!</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 63-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 21, Cook 32)</strong> Harris is certainly getting it to rag out of the rough, but you suspect that nobody on either side really believes he is going to take wickets, and that makes a huge difference. Shane Warne could turn it exactly the same amount and end up with a six-for. Anyway, Strauss tickles one to third man for three.</p> <p>\"Surely,\" says Paul Roberts, \"Mike Brearley and the rest of his England team would be an example of a pretty large talent gap?\" He would, but only if you see cricket as a two-dimensional game.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 69-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 21, Cook 38)</strong><br>Brainlessly short from Nel, and Cook dumps him through midwicket for four with a real flourish. I think the word is 'Shot!'. England are now cruising towards their first dead-rubber victory in the final Test of the home summer since 1997, a Test best known, of course, for being the last of Digger Martin's career.</p> <p>\"I suggest that Ian Taylor puts on 'Simply The Best', does a lap of honour around the office, high-fiving each and every staff member before waving goodbye at the door with the words 'I've been Ian Taylor - you've been the best',\" says Sam Blackledge. \"Or has that been done before?\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 72-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 21, Cook 38)</strong><br>Strauss takes a dodgy single off Harris but Prince at square leg lets Cook off with a preposterously naff throw that Mark Boucher does well to stop. Cook then fresh-airs a hoick that goes through everyone and away for two byes. What's the chorus of that British Sea Power song 'No Lucifer' again?</p> <p>\"Harris reminds me of our old science teacher at school. He used to coach the cricket team as well, and when we were in the nets he's bowl his brand of off spin that everyone would clatter around,\" says Alistair Stewart. \"He'd then inform us that we'd have hit it straight at the fielder he'd have placed in anticipation of being hit a mile over his head.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 77-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 23, Cook 42)</strong> Another frankly regal pull stroke from Cook for four, although it's staggeringly witless bowling from Nel. Someone give Gunther one of those little 'Logic Problems' books to get his brain working again, please.</p> <p>\"Could you please explain to a newbie the Mike Brearley comment?\" says Andrew Hulbert. \"Do I infer correctly that he was a mediocre cricketer but did something else worthwhile?\" He was, perhaps, the greatest captain of all time - he had, as the Aussie fast bowler Rodney Hogg put it, \"a degree in people\". He was certainly in the top 10, so that more than made up for his modest batting.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 80-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 24, Cook 44)</strong> <br>England continue to prove that you can also milk a dog, taking three from Harris's over.<br> <br>\"The constant criticism of Harris from all quarters puzzles me. He is SA's Ashley Giles - bats well and does a job with the ball (keeps it tight whilst the seamers rotate),\" says David Smeath. \"He's no Shane Warne but he's no worse than countless other Test spinners over the years - remember Ian Salisbury!\" True, but there are differences: Giles was a significantly better batsman, for one, and he won a few Tests outside the subcontinent, most notably in 2004. What Harris does do, as you say, is generally keep it genuinely tight (his Test economy rate is an excellent 2.68) while the four seamers get their break. But in situations like this he's about as useful as Special Slapheads Shampoo.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 90-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 25, Cook 53)</strong> <br>Kallis, who has arguably had his series with the ball since they toured West Indies in 2000-01, comes into the attack. But he makes the mistake of bowling short to Cook, who slaps him through the covers off the back foot to reach a very fine fifty, with 10 fours (mostly thumping pull shots) and from 83 balls. It'd be nice if he could get his first century of the summer today.</p> <p>Iain McCulloch is back, armed with a thesaurus and a broadband connection. \"Smyth, there doesn't seem to be any need to get in an argument \u2013 quoting one fairly ambiguous stat made you downgrade your rating of Harmy in Asia from 'splendid' to 'decent'. If I leave you to your own devices you'll eventually run the gamut through 'middling' and 'patchy' to 'sub-standard' all by yourself. Next!\" Ah but I said his record was decent and his actual bowling (and attitude) splendid. These things are relative, in view of the conditions and perceptions as to how he will performs. Also, YOU RELEASED 'NOTHING LASTS FOREVER'. Next?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 95-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 29, Cook 53)</strong> <br>No threat from Harris, although that doesn't stop Harrus putting his hands in the air like he just don't care after every ball. Strauss comes down the track and screws him through midwicket for four more.</p> <p>Talking of which. \"Does Harris throwing his arms up in the air after every delivery annoy anyone else as much as me?\" says Zac Aldridge, knowing full well the answer. \"He's never going to convince anyone that he can turn the ball.\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 100-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 32, Cook 55)</strong> <br>England are past halfway, and now past 100. It's all over bar the dawdling, but the next 90 runs might have great significance for Michael Vaughan's future. If Strauss is, say, 65 not out he will be hard to drop, as Gary Naylor pointed out earlier.</p> <p>Here's Tom Lawrence. \"<a href=\"http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?bowling_pacespin=1;class=1;filter=advanced;home_or_away=2;opposition=6;opposition=7;opposition=8;orderby=bowling_average;spanmax1=11+Aug+2008;spanmin1=11+Aug+1998;spanval1=span;team=1;template=results;type=bowling\">This link</a> below displays pace bowling stats for the last ten years for England playing away Test matches against India, Pakistan or Sri Lanka.

They should give his match fee to charity, or JD Wetherspoons, and play with 10 men. Frankly, South Africa look like they couldn't give one anymore, and why should they? I wonder what percentage of dead rubbers are won by the side that has lost the series. I bet it's ludicrously high in view of the fact that the side that lost the series is invariably, intrinsically inferior.</p> <p>Here's Raja Dasgupta. \"Re: David Smeath's comment in the 23rd Over ('The constant criticism of Harris from all quarters puzzles me. He is SA's Ashley Giles') - does this count as damning with faint praise, or just damning.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 109-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 38, Cook 58)</strong> <br>Morkel goes past the outside edge of Strauss, the first time that has happened in a while. But England are scoring at a steady rate now, gobbling up runs like Pac-Man does those things he gobbles up. </p> <p>Nick Evans exposes cricket journos for the idiots they are shocker. \"Is it just me or has the coverage of this series focused on the SA batsmen 'booking in for bed and breakfast', and ours batting like carefree ne'er-do-wells who sneak out of a bedroom window at 7am minus half their clothing? Yes Strauss is a far less attractive batsman than in 05, but if Cooky is by all accounts playing a few more shots, surely that should be a nice balance with Strauss leaving everything outside off, boring the bowlers into bowling at the stumps a la McKenzie?\" </p> <p>I think you need one initiative-seizer of an opener: Smith does it for South Africa; Cook isn't ready to do that yet, and ideally should be allowed to develop in his own bubble. In terms of the whole series, I think South Africa have just played the context very well - coincidentally, most of the time it has demanded an accumulative approach - whereas England seem to have one approach regardless of the context.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 109-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 38, Cook 58)</strong><br>What England have done well this morning is use their feet against Harris. There was a 0.00000001 per cent chance that he would settle into a groove and bowl them out on a fifth-day pitch. They took away that chance by not allowing him to settle through positive foot movement (is there any other kind?) and the resulting shots. </p> <p>Iain McCulloch's back for more. \"Darren Gough's sub-continental record is 24 wickets @ 22.58. Now that is splendid. But I'd love to hear your thoughts on his attitude and everything else, cos that's obviously more relevant. And 'Nothing Lasts Forever' reached number 8.00 in the charts, another splendid record.\" Yes, and Darren Gough was world-class whereas Steve Harmison is simply very good. Plus Gough reverse-swings it, which is a huge weapon to have on the subcontinent. Plus Gough's attitude was never questioned, so in mentioning attitude you are being deliberate disingenuous. That's naughty. Bad boy. Naughty boy. Your second point I won't even dignify with a response.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>That's lunch</strong> After a soul-sappingly slow start, Strauss and in particular Cook took complete control against a South African side who left their hearts in San Francheesy, or at least the Edgbaston dressing-room. See you in 30 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>\"Lunch is... lunch is difficult\"</strong> So says the brilliant Brain in the film Brick. And he's right. When you've only got 40 minutes between OBO sessions, lunch can be difficult. Especially when the nearby Sainsbury's has a queue of about 431 people, all spending their daily cheque from the parents on \u00a35 salad leaves and Fairtrade Tic-Tacs.</p> <p>Anyway, the players should be back on in a bit, and sometime around 3.15pm England will be getting ever so slightly giddy on the smell of dead rubber. It's legal, you know.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Lunchtime chat</strong> \"Losing the last Test in a dead rubber depends on the nature of the team, surely,\" says Pete Gay. \"I don't remember tGarner, Holding and co going to sleep in the last mach of a series or, for that matter, the Australians recently. Both those teams were quite happy to rub the opposition's noses in it as hard as they could.\" True with Waugh's Australia, but Taylor's were renowned for it, and even Waugh's did it on occasion: South Africa 2001-02, the Ashes 2002-03. West Indies had a couple as well, most notably - and absurdly - at the hands of Murray Bennett, Bob Holland and Allan Border in 1984-85 and 1988-89.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 115-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 38, Cook 63)</strong> <br>Ntini begins after lunch in what might just be his final spell on these shores. He's been a trooper and all, but I worry about him if he plays in Australia in a few months' time. He will go <em>every</em>where. Anyhoo, in that over he has a big shout for LBW against Strauss, but it obviously pitched outside leg, even to the naked eye. Cook then pushes him blissfully straight for four.</p> <p>\"I have no telly here but I do have windows and its hammering down,\" says Chris Miller. \"Where's the rain? I have money on a draw...\" Don't know how to break this, Chris, but the weather <em>isn't the same all round the world</em>?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>31th over: England 119-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 42, Cook 63)</strong><br>The man who won the little-known South African reality TV show, How Do You Solve A Problem Like Tayfield?, continues to bowl to absolutely no effect whatsoever. Strauss works one round the corner for a couple. This presents a really interesting selection problem, because they won't have the stones to drop Strauss now that he has made one whole fifty in the series. So that means - if we work on the not unreasonable assumption that five bowlers are back for the forseeable future - that there is probably only room for one of Vaughan, Bopara and Shah in the squad to tour India.</p> <p>\"Have you got my Starship CD?\" writes one of OBO's finest, Sam Collins. \"I can't find it anywhere.\" No I haven't, Collins, you sick fool.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 123-1 (Cook c Smith b Ntini 67)</strong><br>Cook fails in the sixties for the seventh time in the last year. The ball after pulling another blistering boundary, he drove at a full delivery from Ntini that left him just enough to take the edge and went straight into the shovel hands of Graeme Smith at first slip.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 127-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 42, Bell 0)</strong><br>Bell walks a long, long way across his stumps to Ntini first ball. The ball flies to third man - but it's given as leg-byes, which means it must have been a pretty close shout, even allowing for Ntini's largely prohibitive angle. Hawkeye indeed has it hitting a good portion of leg stump.</p> <p>\"Have you got my Mick Hucknall poster?\" writes Sam Collins. \"I can't find it anywhere.\" No I haven't, Collins, you sick fool.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>33rd over: England 130-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 45, Bell 0)</strong><br>Strauss lifts Harris high over the infield, like a father hoisting his child above his head, for a couple. I wouldn't even take Harris as a Kolpak; he is useless.</p> <p>\"So, the question is, is Cook the 'new' Thorpe? Scoring plenty of <br>half tons, and not converting,\" says David Horn. \"And, if so, is that a bad thing? Discuss.\" Interesting. They could hardly have got those half-tons in different ways, but it was a huge problem for Thorpe (and another left-hander, Stephen Fleming), in the first half of his career. The thing is, of course, that before this year it wasn't a problem: I think only Bradman, Miandad and A.N.Other had scored more Test tons before their 23rd birthday.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>34th over: England 138-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 53, Bell 0)</strong> Strauss screws a back-foot force off Ntini to third man. With nobody there, it goes for four. Strauss then plays a really nice stroke through midwicket for a boundary that brings up his fifty, his first of the series, from 95 balls and with five fours. It's been a pulse-free effort, but it's probably breathed new life into his Test career.</p> <p>\"Have you got my Angela Lansbury keyring?\" writes Sam Collins (well, nobody <em>else</em> is writing in, are they eh?). \"I can't find it anywhere.\" No I haven't, Collins, you sick fool.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 138-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 53, Bell 0)</strong> <br>Harris continues over the wicket to Bell and - no word of a lie - he has a chance put down. Bell, going back, gets a big inside-edge onto the pad and McKenzie at short leg, moving to his right with all the speed of fossilisation (copyright Georgina Turner 2006), puts it down.</p> <p>\"Assuming we limp there soon, have you ever been more underwhelmed by a win?\" asks Lee Calvert. I was fairly underwhelmed when I 'won' a packet of Chewits simply for having my haircut at some dodgy alcoholic barbers (you never went after lunch, or if you did you paid the price) in Milton Regis once when I was kid, but that's about it.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 142-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 57, Bell 0)</strong><br>Good shot from Strauss, showing the full face to Ntini and putting him back down the ground for four. If England lose this, there's only one person to blame: Tom Daley. I've yet to be convinced he's not responsible for the sad drop in quality of Peep Show either. And as for the disappearance of Beef Discos.</p> <p>\"Have you got my Paul McKenna bottom-shaver?\" writes Sam Collins. \"I can't find it anywhere.\" No I haven't, Collins, you sick fool.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 146-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 57, Bell 4)</strong> Bell is a little uneasy against Harris as he gets used to the rough and the over-the-wicket angle, but it's just barely noticeable detail on the bigger picture of the match. Which is in itself barely noticeable etc on the bigger picture of the series.</p> <p>Eventually Bell works Harris nicely through midwicket for four to get off the mark.</p> <p>\"This consolation win is going book this whole shower on the plane to India, and then into the Ashes team,\" harrumphs Alfred Moore, who I might call Alfie from now on just for the sake of it. \"I've suspected for a while that Strauss is the consummate cricket politician - great at getting elected, but rubbish at governing - because he knows that a fifty in the last Test is worth about a hundred and fifty in the first.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 147-2 (Bell b Ntini 4)</strong><br>Great idea/execution combos of our time: part one in a short series. Ian Bell, the Oval, 2008, decides to combat Makhaya Ntini's unusual angle by walking miles across his stumps to work him to leg. He should be given LBW first ball but isn't. He carries on regardless, fearless eejit that he is, and is bowled round his legs from <em>over</em> the wicket playing exactly the same shot. Dear oh dear; that was pitiful.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 147-2 (chasing 197, Strauss 57, Pietersen 0)</strong><br>The idea is not unsound - Pietersen does it excellently against Ntini to open up the leg side - but Bell misjudged the extent to which he needed to go across to a frankly hideous degree.</p> <p>\"Rob, it's time to put your cards on the table and give us your touring 15 for India,\" says Sam Blackledge. Not this again! I did the other day! (!!!!!!!!). Anyway, it would be: Cook, Vaughan, Bell, KP (we're friends; he calls me RS, at least I think that's what he says honkety honk!), Collingwood, Flintoff, Prior, Foster, Harmison, Sidebottom, Jones, Panesar, Swann, Broad, Bopara.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 147-3 (Strauss c Smith b Harris 58)</strong><br>Could an epic farce be unfolding? Probably not, but Strauss has gone. It was straightforward stuff: he pushed forward with hard hands at Harris, but got an inside-edge onto the pad and round the corner to Smith at leg slip.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 148-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 0, Collingwood 1)</strong><br>I'm putting some salt on my toenails just in case, because if England lose another one it opens up a huge tail. Still, I'm sure there is no chance of them blowing this. Collingwood pads up to the rest of Harris's over.</p> <p>\"Do you have my matching Gareth Gates pyjamas and duvet cover set?\" says James McKerney. \"I can't find them anywhere.\" Actually I <em>do</em>. Do you need them back straight away? They're awful comfortable.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 152-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 0, Collingwood 5)</strong><br>Collingwood works Ntini to leg for an all-run four, and then misses a pull that goes through to Boucher. Atherton thinks there was an inside-edge but replays show it just hit the right thigh. Outstanding umpiring from Steve Davis.</p> <p>If Collingwood is to stay in this team - and he deserves to in the short term after that century - it must be at No5. He and Pietersen bat really well together. It's odd that teams are happy to structure a batting order according to left-hand/right-hand balance but rarely in accordance with something more important: chemistry. Anyone think of other great pairs batting together? When they weren't running each other out farcically, Butcher and Hussain were superb together - there was Brisbane 98, Nottingham 03, Jamaica 04, Headingley 01, and other family favourites.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 156-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 4, Collingwood 5)</strong><br>Pietersen uses that huge reach to whip Harris majestically, and against the spin, through midwicket for four, a shot of naked, mind-boggling talent.</p> <p>\"Many thanks for starting the Tom Daley backlash,\" says David Hopkins. \"No one likes a show-off, especially one who is less than half your age. Can I be the first to state that even if he is only fourteen, he still finished last which makes him a LOSER. Could you arrange for the Guardian to print a Tom Daley dartboard cf. the Sun's David Beckham one in 1998.\" I don't know about a dartboard, but I'm sure he could be included as a key ingredient in one of the free recipes.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 161-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 7, Collingwood 5)</strong><br>Morkel is back on, for Ntini, and it's a sign that South Africa aren't too bothered about this that they haven't brought on Kallis to bowl at his bunny. Either that or Kallis is carrying an injury. Pietersen, in the meantime, plays another sumptuous wristy stroke through midwicket, this time for three off Morkel. </p> <p>\"Wot no Shah?\" says Steve Busfield. \"Does this batting line up not need some refreshing?\" Well it does, but Collingwood has done enough to stay in for a bit now. With the exception of Pietersen and to an extent Cook, everyone's places are up for grabs in the short-to-medium term. But I think Bell, Vaughan and Collingwood have done enough to deserve a chance in India. Key is next cab on the rank for Bell, Denly for Vaughan, and Bopara for Collingwood. In my opinion too much water has gone under the bridge - like with Andy Cole and England - for Shah to be able to play with freedom in the Test team. They are only so many times you can be rejected before you conclude that it's not them, it's you. Not playing him in Sri Lanka last year was a disgusting decision on, at a conservative estimate, 46 levels.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 161-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 7, Collingwood 5)</strong><br>This could turn out very, very well for KP: a win in the first Test as captain, the man of the match award I would have thought, and maybe the winning runs as well. Anyway, Harris continues into the rough, and I suspect it won't be too long before we see the first switch-hit from a Test captain. He actually dummied to do it from one ball in that over. </p> <p>\"Hussain and Butcher were good, but Hoggy and Gilo were superb!\" says Gary Naylor, eschewing insight in favour of unashamedly brainless nostalgia. And who can blame him, frankly.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 170-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 7, Collingwood 14)</strong><br>Consecutive boundaries for Collingwood off Morkel: the first was pulled witheringly, the second time through midwicket. </p> <p>\"For a brief while Flintoff and Geraint Jones proved a fine partnership,\" says Paul Roberts (and a few others). \"Maybe to recover Freddie's batting form, England need to recall Papua New Guinea's finest.\"</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 170-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 7, Collingwood 15)</strong> For those of you calling me various shades of eff, the reason I'd leave Anderson out is that, for all his admirable improvement, I just don't think he is good enough to take wickets against the very best. Do what the opposition least want you to do. Ricky Ponting would pick Anderson to bowl at him all day.</p> <p>\"Have you got my signed photo of Tom Daley?\" says Wesley Ball. \"If you have, you can keep it.\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>46th over: England 175-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 8, Collingwood 19)</strong> Nearly there now, as Collingwood dumps Morkel contemptuously over midwicket for four more. There is a perception about Collingwood that he doesn't have shots, but it's more about the mindset he sometimes gets into when he's wearing whites. Batting with KP frees him up, I think.</p> <p>\"What's Vaughan done with the bat of late?\" challenges Dominic O'Reilly. Sweet eff, but I think he's earned enough slack for us to accept his explanation - that the captaincy was frazzling his mind - and to give him at least those two Tests to see if he was right or if he was telling big fat porkies. A year ago, in Sri Lanka, he played superbly as an opener - and with the dustbowls we'll probably get it's even more importantly we have an opener who embraces calculated risk against the new ball.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>47th over: England 175-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 8, Collingwood 19)</strong><br>Harris and KP continue their little leg-stump stand-off: it's Adelaide 2006 all over again! (The good bit, on the second day, not the unmentionable.) A maiden.</p> <p>\"Hear hear re: that irritatingly little snot-nosed brat at the Olympics,\" says Richard Norris. \"I know he's only 14, but what does he want: a medal?\"</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>48th over: England 178-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 9, Collingwood 19)</strong><br>Pietersen takes one of his buttock-clenchingly tight singles into the off side. The throw missed by a while; had it hit it would have been, well, buttock-clenchingly tight.</p> <p>\"I remember Robin Smith and Allan Lamb being great together in the late 80s/very early 90s,\" says Oliver Lewis. \"Yes, they were both Saffers, but I think crucially both had moustaches. More than a coincidence I think.\" Especially against the West Indies, when they went way beyond the call of duty for their adopted country.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 182-4 (Pietersen c McKenzie b Harris 13)</strong> <br>Pietersen falls in tame fashion. Harris switched to around the wicket with mid-off and mid-on back in an attempt to play on the ego, and Pietersen just plopped one onto his pad and up in the air for short leg to take the catch.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>49th over: England 182-4 (chasing 197; Collingwood 19, Flintoff 0)</strong><br>Kim Sibthorpe's life may be missing something: life, chiefly. \"Whatever happened to the slower ball?? I was thinking about this the other day.\"</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>50th over: England 185-4 (chasing 197; Collingwood 22, Flintoff 1)</strong><br>Nel comes on for one last spurt, but somebody forgot to grease him up: he's rumbling in at about quarter rat-power.</p> <p>\"Couldn't agree more about Anderson,\" says Alfie Moore. \"This is supposed to have been his breakthrough season, but 15 wickets @ 34 doesn't seem much of a breakthrough. Compare Hoggard's breakthrough series in South Africa 04-05: 26 wickets @ 25. If we stick with Anderson we'll just be cultivating mediocrity - we'd be better off bringing back Hoggard, who has the nous to be our Chaminda Vaas.\" What he said.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>51st over: England 186-4 (chasing 197; Collingwood 23, Flintoff 1)</strong><br>Mid-off and mid-on go back for Flintoff against Harris as well, though not quite as far as for Pietersen, but Flintoff isn't yet confident enough in this environment to finish a game as he would at county level, or as he would at Test level a few years back, so he blocks assiduously.</p> <p>\"Just about any combination of very tall and very short batsmen works well, as it upsets the bowler's length,\" says John Starbuck, inadvertently pointing out that Will Jefferson is the key to Tim Ambrose's Test career. \"Think Greig and Knott, if your memory goes that far back.\" My memory doesn't go back to the start of thi- what day is this?</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>52nd over: England 188-4 (chasing 197; Collingwood 25, Flintoff 1)</strong><br>Collingwood tucks Nel off his pads and, in a gesture that sums up the man, Ntini charges across the boundary, dives and saves two runs: an outstanding piece of work. What a thoroughly admirable fellow he is.</p> <p>\"Is Tom Daley the greatest British loser since Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards,\" says Lee Calvert, \"Sure, Daley has the excuse of being 14, but Edwards equally had the excuse of being nearly blind. Also, Daley has had access to pools full of water for all of his recently over-exposed life while Eddie had to practice on slides in his local park, skateboard half-pipes and his own stairs. And while I'm on, have you got my Diagnosis Murder tankard?\" Gave it to Sam Collins. You'll do well to get that back.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>ENGLAND WIN AN ENTIRELY MEANINGLESS GAME BY SIX WICKETS!!! </strong> <br>Flintoff rocks back to cut Harris for four and then, when Harris tempts him with some flight, Flintoff can't resist ending the match in the grand manner with the most marvellous straight six. He finishes on 11 and Paul Collingwood on 25.</p> <p>So there we are. It's a happy ending to a pretty downbeat summer, but at least England can go forward into the winter with optimism, however misplaced it might seem to be. They were always going to win this game after rolling South Africa on the first day, and they finished the job pretty efficiently today. Certainly, they look a better side with five bowlers.

  "<h2>Cinema and politics</h2> <p>From its inception, cinema was conceived as a mass-market entertainment. Film was a new and exciting form of cultural production, whose mass appeal and collective experience naturally aligned it with the struggles for democracy underway at the time. So it's not surprising that demagogues of every sort embraced film as the perfect instrument of political propaganda.</p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>In the 20s, the Russians used photography and film to promote the popular-front politics of communist revolution. The techniques of mechanical reproduction and mass production implicit in the production and distribution of films made them especially useful for an ideology promoting international revolution. Film was a key element in the battle for hearts and minds - the propaganda trains had wagons of exhibitions and screening room wagons so news of the revolution could be circulated to the most isolated parts of the Russian interior.</p> <h2>Latin America</h2> <p>In Latin America during the 60s and 70s, cinema was used to promote the ideals of the Cuban revolution and to counter the cultural hegemony of America. While American studios drowned in resources, these groups had almost no marketing budgets and were working at a local, not international, level. So it's not surprising their posters look strikingly different from those the other side of the equator. </p> <h2>Printing and Political Economy</h2> <p>It's not just differences in economy and ideology that led to this disparity - massively different techniques of image making and reproduction were also a factor. In Cuba this meant screen-printing - a technique whose origins are connected to the stencil-cutting and vernacular signage traditions. Screens are made up of a fine mesh. Careful cutting of a top layer creates a stencil that could be supported by the mesh. This allows ink to be squeezed through the stencil and screen to create a print. The stencil screen was robust enough to be re-used.</p> <p>In its original form, sometimes called seriography, this technique required few resources and was available to marginal groups. The New Deal, Works Progress Administration artists used screen-printing to create inexpensive images of America during the 30s (some of which are on view in London as part of the British Museum's American Scene exhibition).</p> <h2>Screen printing</h2> <p>Compared with lithography and letterpress printing, access to screen-printing was inexpensive and made small run posters for local events possible. In the 50s and 60s, the development of light-sensitive make-ready for stencils helped reduce the labour and costs associated with screen-printing. New printing inks and finer screens gave the prints a vibrant and solid base of colour that distinguished them from the mass of offset-litho produced advertising images.</p> <p>If you look carefully at silk-screen posters, the ink lies thickly in the surface of the paper and seems a solid block of colour. The ink has a sharp edge that exaggerates the optical disruption of any errors in colour registration.</p> <p>In America, campus revolutionaries embraced screen-printing to promote the ideas of the emerging protest movements. In France, the posters of Mai 1968 were made by silk-screen. So it's hardly surprising we're still subject to the global proliferation of Alberto Korda's iconic portrait of Che Guevara.</p> <h2>Posters</h2> <p>For post-revolutionary Cuba, the film poster became a means of promoting revolutionary values across Latin-America and South-East Asia. This was done through the solidarity organisations aimed at the people of Africa, Asia and Latin-America (OSPAAAL) and at the worldwide student body (OCLAE). The Cuban Film Institute played an active role in the distribution of Cuban films and various publicity materials across Latin America.</p> <p>Writing in 1970, Susan Sontag itemised the values of Cuban poster art as internationalist, diverse, eclectic and as exemplifying moral seriousness and a commitment to artistic excellence. So, the Cuban film poster does much more than advertise a film; it begins to distinguish its audience.</p>",
  "<p><strong>2pm Beijing time</strong> Welcome to the Water Cube, where Tom Daley is about to take his Olympic bow alongside Blake Aldridge in the synchronised 10m platform diving, due off at 2.30pm here.</p> <p>The British contingent inside the aquatics centre is beaming after Rebecca Adlington and Joanne Jackson took gold and bronze in the 400m freestyle a couple of hours ago, but young Tom's debut is not a parochial affair. He made the front page of the China Daily's sports section today, evidence that he has captured the imagination beyond Blighty.</p> <p>They love a diver in China, unsurprising perhaps given that they have won 20 of the 32 titles in Olympic history, and they look nailed on for another one this afternoon courtesy of reigning world champions Lin Yue and Huo Lang. Russian pair Gleb Galperin and Dmitriy Dobroskok look the most likely challengers to the Chinese so the received wisdom is that Tom and Blake - does that make them sound like singer and lead guitar in an earnest indie band? - are competing for the bronze with the USA and Germany. T&amp;B appeared at poolside about 40 minutes ago to join the throng of divers warming up for competition. There are about 20 divers hurling themselves off the various springboards and platforms in front of me, almost casually reeling off fiendishly acrobatic dives.</p> <p>T&amp;B joined in at 1.37pm, taking their first practice plunge off the 5m platform, before trying the 10m board 10 minutes later. Helpfully Tom is wearing black wristbands, which makes identification a little easier. Surprisingly given his youth and size - he's 5'1\" in his verucca socks - he's not that much smaller or younger-looking than the rest of the field.</p> <p>They have just wandered over to speak to Leon Taylor, who won silver with Pete Waterfield four years ago and has been acting as his mentor in the run-up to the games. The British entourage all give the pair a hug and they are off to the locker room to prepare for the real thing.</p> <p><strong>2.15pm</strong> A word about the format. There are eight teams in today's final qualifying by virtue of performances in the 2007 World Championships and the 2008 World Cup. They are, by order of start list, Australia, Cuba, Great Britain, Germany, USA, Colombia, China and Russia.</p> <p>Each pair will perform six dives in rotation, each of which has a degree of difficulty. Daley and Aldridge will start with a forward one-and-a-half somersault. With pike. Obviously. Degree-of-difficulty 2.0. There are nine judges, four to rate execution and five to look after synchronisation. As the name suggests, that last category is the key to the event. The official list does not give the nationality of the judges, so the conspiracy theories will have to wait until later.</p> <p>Two execution judges sit on each side of the pool judging the diver nearest to them only. The five synchronicity judges also split up but watch both divers. They then each award a mark out of 10, with the highest and lowest score in each category dropped. That leaves five scores of 10 or less. The total is then multiplied by three and divided by five to give a raw score out of 30. That is then multiplied by the degree of difficulty to give the final score. Got that?</p> <p><strong>2.20pm</strong> The teams have just arrived and lined up in their tracksuits for their introduction. A large cheer and several Union flags greet T&amp;B, but the welcome is beaten by the reception the Australians get. Lots of Aussies lingering from the morning events I suspect. The Chinese get a huge roar. Young Tom looks his usual unnaturally relaxed self.</p> <p><strong>2.30pm</strong> Leon Taylor is not only an Olympic silver medallist but also officially a very nice chap. He has just shared the benefit of his considerable wisdom with the Guardian moments before going on air to share it with the nation. According to Leon, Tom is relaxed, but the challenge he and Blake face is performing under pressure in their first major final.</p> <p>\"When Pete and I got our medal in Athens we had the benefit of having been to Sydney and finished fifth,\" he says. \"We left there knowing what an Olympic final is about and in Athens we knew if we did our stuff some of the rookies would drop away. If Tom and Blake can deal with the pressure then they have a chance.\"</p> <p><strong>2.30pm</strong> Tom's parents Rob and Debbie have been spotted in the crowd on the far side of the pool with his two brothers and all four grandparents. Tom has just been spotted in the shower and he can't resist a grin at the camera. He really does appear to be made for this. Meanwhile, the Australians Matthew Helm and Robert Newberry are on the board for the first dive. It's all downhill from here...</p> <p><strong>2.32pm</strong> Aged 14 years and 94 days Tom Daley is about to appear in an Olympic final.</p> <p><strong>2.34</strong> And it's a good one by the look of it. They score 52.8 overall, with higher marks for synchronisation than execution. No sign of nerves from here, but they will be feeling better for that.</p> <p><strong>2.40pm</strong> The first round is over with Daley and Aldridge lying joint third in a three-way tie with Australia and Germany. All the teams kicked off with fairly routine dives, nothing more difficult than a 2.0, but it is fairly clear already that the Chinese are the team to beat.</p> <p>Lin Yue and Huo Lang loook less like two divers than one and a mirror. Their first effort was the most straightforward there is, listed simply as a \"forward dive\" with pike, but they nailed it and barely left a splash behind them and got a whopping 57.0 from the judges. True to the form book the Russians are lying second with 53.4, then comes the pack on 52.8. Long way to go and all that, but T&amp;B seem to be scrapping for the places.</p> <p><strong>2.51pm</strong> Relax everyone, the politicians have arrived. Sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe has just slipped into his seat two along from Tessa Jowell just in time to see T&amp;B take their second plunge, an inward one-and-half somersault that the judges don't like so much. They get only 50.4 for an effort that somehow, imperceptibly almost was not as tidy as their first. It is hard to say how, but you get a sense of whether they've nailed it from the sound as the pair of them enter the water like missiles. The better executed the dive the less splash, and the more synchronised they are the crisper the noise as they enter the water. That noise was, for want of the technical term, a bit sloppy.</p> <p>It wasn't good enough to keep them in the medal places after two rounds either. The Americans, Germans and the Aussies out-scored them there, but all are chasing the Chinese. Lin and Huo's second dive was, according to the judges, approaching perfection, an inward dive - they start with their backs to the water - worth 59.4, only six tenths off a perfect 60 for that dive. They've opened up an 8 point lead on the Russians and there's a 13-point gap to T&amp;B. Work to do.</p> <p><strong>3.03pm</strong> Round three and another splashy effort from T&amp;B. Their most difficult dive yet, an inward three-and-a-half somersault gets nothing better than a seven for execution, but the synchronicity wasn't too bad. Was that a touch of over-rotation I spotted on entry? I'll check with a judge later.</p> <p>Anyway, it's dropped them down to last place because the opposition are starting to get tricksy. Even the Cubans and the Colombians have steamed past. The German pair Patrick Hausding and Sascha Klein just pulled off a very fancy effort, two-and-half backward somersaults with one-and-a-half twists thrown in. Most of us would be lucky to live if we tried it, but they manage to break the water within a fag paper of each other to push up into the medals at the expense of the USA. The Chinese continue to set the standard and are way out in front. On this form they could afford to bomb their last dive and still win.</p> <p><strong>3.13pm</strong> THe halfway stage and it seems that Blake is in charge of the team, assuming that the boss is the one that says \"Ready, steady, go\" when they're balancing on tiptoe 10m above the pool. Not sure exactly what he says, but he definitely mouths something that only Tom can hear before the leap into the void.</p> <p>A better effort by some distance in the fourth round, a back three-and-a-half somersault, and a poor effort from the Germans cheers up the Brits a bit more. They are resigned however to young Tom marking this one down as experience.</p> <p>The Chinese meanwhile are already humming the national anthem as Lin Yue and Huo Lang produce another awesome effort. As they leap into their inward three-and-a-half somersault even the water droplets spraying from their hair appear to fly in unison. They maintain their eight point lead over the Russians, and the tussle for bronze looks to be between the USA, currently third, and the Germans four points back. T&amp;B lie seventh, ahead of the Cubans.</p> <p><strong>3.20pm</strong> Fascinating though it is to concentrate on a lad who ought be on his BMX with his mates experimenting with tobacco, but instead finds himself taking on the world, it would be remiss not to briefly mention the rest of the field. The Cubans are the duo you would least want to fight, while the Colombians have the best tattoos by some distance. The Russians have the palest skin and sternest brows, just ahead of the Germans.</p> <p>While we wait for the fifth round to get under way, meanwhile, a hidden DJ plays us a re-mix of what I think is Cotton Eye Joe, a risible dance track from the late 1990s. Those keen to know who it was by, look below later. Someone will know.</p> <p><strong>3.27pm</strong> We've seen the fifth round and the Chinese could still win if only one diver makes it up the ladder. They are 24 points clear and the crowd are going wild, flags waving as they chant \"China, China\". Another iffy disco tune is playing and everyone else joins in for a bit of a boogie in the stands. It feels like a lively rain delay at Wimbledon with revolutionary Communist overtones.</p> <p>Behind the Chinese the Russians look safe in second, but the battle for bronze is wide open, though not open enough for T&amp;B to have a chance. They are still seventh, holding off the Cubans for pride's sake, but anyone of Germany, currently third, Australia and the USA can take the third medal.</p> <p><strong>3.35pm</strong> That's it, all over in the Water Cube and Tom Daley's first Olympic competition ends in last place, less than a point behind the Cubans. Leon Taylor was right - performing under this pressure when you have never encountered it before is not easy. Tom looks as delighted to be here as he has since that grin first emerged, and he knows that he will have a much better chance to take a medal four years hence, all being well. Blake may not get the chance, which is why he looks a little more glum.</p> <p>China, naturally, have taken gold, and they almost took the roof off with their final dive, a hugely difficult back two-and-a-half somersault with two-and-a-half twists. I feel like I need to visit my chiropractor after typing it, but they manage it effortlessly to seal China's 22nd diving gold in Olympic history.</p> <p>In a dramatic finish meanwhile the Germans edge out the Russians for the silver, much to the disappointment of Gleb and Dmitriy. Off to see what T&amp;B have to say about it now, thanks for paying attention.</p>",
  "<p>The credit crunch, which has dragged the UK economy to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/08/economicgrowth.economics\">brink of recession</a>, has wiped \u00a3600bn from the wealth of the UK - more than \u00a31m a minute - since the crisis began a year ago, accountants said today. </p> <p>A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers showed that housing wealth has plummeted by \u00a3400bn while sharp falls in the share prices of<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">banks and financial institutions</a> have wiped out another \u00a3200bn.</p> <p>With house prices suffering a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/08/houseprices.mortgages?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">record double-digit fall</a> last month, households are tightening their purse-strings and cutting back on shopping. </p> <p>PWC's research focused on the housing and financial sectors, as they are particularly affected by the global tightening in lending. It warned that consumer spending could fall by another \u00a312-16bn as the effects of the negative stockmarket and destruction in housing wealth filter through. This will knock off up to 1% from the country's entire GDP over the next year-and-a-half with additional impact on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/jul/12/redundancy.housingmarket\">employment</a> and growth.</p> <p>\"The fall in wealth will mean that UK household spending growth is likely to slow to just 0.5% in 2009,\" said John Hawksworth, head of macroeconomics at PWC. \"However, that will not be enough in itself to push the UK into recession. We are sailing pretty close to recession but it will take something else to push us over the edge.\"</p> <p>But the accountants said that its perspective is \"conservative\", and that this is its best case scenario, excluding the impact and likely spill-over of other important related sectors.</p> <p>Separately, a survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and financial services group KPMG found that more than a quarter of all employers now plan to shed jobs over the next three months.</p> <p>The survey also revealed that the number of employers looking to take on staff this September - traditionally the most buoyant time for recruitment - dropped to only 29%, nearly 10 percentage points lower than for the same period last year.</p> <p>John Philpott, chief economist at the CIPD, said: \"The jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the UK economy. But cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook.\"</p>",
  "<p>Do cyclists need helmets? So <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/11/healthandwellbeing.transport\">asks Stuart Jeffries</a> in today's G2. Well I've been cycling regularly in London - and several other big cities - for about 20 years now, and for a good 19 of them I've worn protective headgear.</p> <p>Why? To be honest, after the first few months it became sheer habit as much as anything else. These days, pedalling anywhere without that familiar polystyrene shield clamped in place - even a two-minute spin to the shops - makes me feel dangerously exposed.</p> <p>It's been a process made all the simpler by the fact that as I replaced a helmet every few years its successor was progressively lighter, better ventilated and more comfortable. Whereas once my headgear was a <a href=\"http://punchthekeys.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/small_bu010989.jpg\">shiny, outsized half mushroom</a>, it is <a href=\"http://www.ukbikestore.co.uk/product_images/Medium/giro_havoc_08;Warehouse;Warehouse.jpg\">now (almost) cool</a>.</p> <p>As Jeffries mentions, in London's often depressingly macho bike culture, helmets are ubiquitous. The same was true when I lived in Sydney, where they had just become compulsory, an experiment which <a href=\"http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:Oy2yZXkhDZcJ:www.cyclehelmets.org/papers/c2022.pdf+nsw+state+%2B+cycle+helmets&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2\">brought mixed results</a> - fewer head injuries but also fewer cyclists.</p> <p>I have remained helmeted even when many of those around me were bare headed and carefree, for example when living in Paris. The one place I sometimes risked it was Beijing, but that was principally to avoid standing out even more than I did anyway as I joined the cycling masses.</p> <p>So if I survived there - and modern Beijing is dominated more by reckless <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/28/pollution.carbonemissions\">car traffic</a> than cyclists - why bother with the helmet, bearing in mind the inconclusive evidence for it efficacy?</p> <p>Firstly, there have been a couple of occasions when wearing a helmet turned a nasty fall which could easily have left me concussed into a far less serious spill. Admittedly, one accident happened while mountain biking and the other when I was cycling home drunk (though luckily still sober enough to fasten the helmet properly).</p> <p>Most of all I think this: a bike helmet only has to save me once. I would probably walked away from the two other crashes, but something more serious could await me any day.</p> <p>Am I being gloomy and over-cautious or just sensible?</p>",
  "<p>The creation of the European Union's cap and trade system (<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission.htm\">EU emissions trading scheme</a>) in 2005 was no small feat. Businesses face a cap on their emissions, and, in general, must either reduce their emissions or pay others to do so for them. It is the most sophisticated and successful carbon market yet, and the centrepiece of EU efforts to reduce its carbon emissions. And despite significant teething problems, the scheme is working reasonably well. </p> <p>But three years after it was created, another challenge remains: to persuade businesses and investors that that carbon price will stay high over the long term. This is critical if the ETS is to help stimulate investment in low carbon technologies. Investors need to believe that the price of carbon will remain high. If they do not, they are unlikely to invest in technologies that will only prove profitable if the carbon price remains high over several decades.</p> <p>The past volatility in the price of carbon hasn't helped. But there is also a structural problem in the ETS: the scheme is run by politicians \u2013 the European Commission in collaboration with the member states of the EU. Investors know that governments face pressures to gain short term political reward through actions which could undermine the carbon price. They worry \u2013 with good reason \u2013 that they will succumb to those pressures, and cut deals with the commission on emissions targets which will result in a reduced carbon price.</p> <p>The commission has been more independent than many expected. It enforced stringent emissions targets earlier this year, rejecting many of the member states' proposed carbon limits and <a href=\"http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L09594698.htm\">facing down a German threat to take legal action</a> over its decision. Nonetheless, as emissions are cut more aggressively in the future, and as an increasing part of the economy is brought within the purview of the ETS, so the commission's position will become ever more politically uncomfortable.</p> <p>The European Central Bank removed governments' ability to set interest rates, and therefore to pursue short term political gains at the cost of inflation. The running of Europe's carbon market should be similarly depoliticised. A central bank-type institution could provide both the political independence and the institutional credibility to reassure investors that a high carbon price will be sustained. </p> <p>This institution \u2013 an emissions trading authority \u2013 would distribute national emissions caps to the member states and monitor emissions reductions. These caps would be set at the level the authority deemed necessary to meet a long term politically defined target (such as a particular percentage cut in emissions by 2050). This would be similar to the relationship between central banks and governments, with the bank setting interest rates to meet an inflation target. As policy moves towards auctioning emissions allowances rather than allocating them for free, the new institution would administer the auctions. It would also ensure that trading is transparent and that the market operates efficiently and with reasonable price stability. This would entail occasional intervention in the market, to buy or sell allowances. </p> <p>The major obstacle to setting up such an institution is that a new EU treaty would be needed. It would give the EU sole competence over emissions policy as it has in international trade. Given the collapse of the Lisbon treaty, it may be best to attempt this in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/16/eu.ireland1\">single issue treaty</a> rather than as part of a grander, more ambitious document of the type that has been rejected in recent years. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.centreforum.org/assets/pubs/ets.pdf\">European emissions trading authority could also serve as a model</a> for a global market in carbon. The former BP chairman, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c3a8d506-034a-11dc-a023-000b5df10621.html?nclick_check=1\">Lord Browne, has called for a similar institution</a>, arguing it is critical if carbon is to be traded like other commodities. The EU should seize the opportunity to inspire the rest of the world.</p>",

With 15 mins to go.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>4.45 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>We're still having a collective intake of breath over two exceptional races. On the telly Sharon Davies is still crying about Rebecca Adlington's gold and Jo Jackson's bronze. Meanwhile, Chris Wright is blown away by that 4x100 Freestyle relay, \"That 4x100 was amazing. The first five all beat the world record and even Britain, in last, were just half a second outside it.\" And in Christian Wolff in India, 'state TV's toying with its viewers has reached new heights: about 10 minutes ago, the hockey match was interrupted - said the studio anchor, \"and we're interrupting the hockey for good reason..\" - presumably to show the 4x100m relay final, RIGHT?! - \"in order to show you yesterday's highlights!\" Really.' Team GB are 4-2 up against Pakistan in the hockey as the game enters its dying moments.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>4.55 am:</strong> <strong>Equestrian.</strong> In fairness to Indian tv, all the non-Brits I know, are really frustrated with British Olympic coverage. Where is all the water polo? And the beach volleyball? They ask. Especially, our national obsession with 'horse racing, that isn't even horse racing.\" And what of our Eventing team? Well, William Fox-Pitt rode fastest for Great Britain who have risen to third after the cross country. The German team lead the rankings after impressive performances from their riders, while Australia dropped to second.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>5.00 am:</strong> <strong>Archery</strong> \"As the only Englishman in an all Chinese office here in Beijing,\" writes Steve George, \"the atmosphere is proving unusually tense, is anyone else watching the team GB/China archery showdown?

Better for office diplomacy, I'm guessing.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>5.05 am:</strong> <strong>Cycling.</strong> From the sublime to the ridiculous. Spanish track cyclist Maria Isabel Moreno has been named as the first competitor in Beijing to fail a drugs test. Moreno, 27, would have been a rival of Britain's gold medallist Nicole Cook, tested positive for the blood-doping agent EPO.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>5.10 am:</strong> It's time for a Brit-in-the-antipodes-perspective from Andrew Jolly. \"At least for Brits at home it's all on in the middle of the night, and you don't have to face Olympic Mad Aussies popping into your office every 10 seconds to say that some Australian swimmer or other has smashed out a world record in the pool. I watched us win that race a moment ago, but am withholding any sort of interoffice gloat fest at the moment, I have learned from the Ashes that one wicket does not make a test match. Not even one. Or even a draw... Bring on the velodrome.\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>5.25 am:</strong> <strong>Shooting. </strong>Joy for Christian Wolff. Indian tv can stop showing Pakistan losing, India have won gold. Abhinav Bindra wins the men's 10m air rifle.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Brit-in-the-antipodes-perspective II.</strong> \"TVNZ have helpfully got three live streaming channels online in addition to their TV coverage (also streamed online). Hurrah, thought I, I'll be able to watch the swimming. Except work's gone and blocked the stream\", tuts Joanna Harris in New Zealand, \"Of course there's no saying TVNZ would have shown the swimming; so far their coverage has been pretty appalling, for example hours of beach volleyball and boxing instead of rowing (we got the Kiwis' races, but that was it). And there are ad breaks every ten minutes.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>5.30 am:</strong> <strong>Tennis.</strong>World No.1 elect Rafael Nadal is making uncharacteristically hard work of Italian World No.71 Potito Starace. After losing the first set, Strarace has pulled the second set back. It's going with serve in the third set.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>5.45 am:</strong> <strong>Fencing. Britwatch. </strong>The USA's Erinn Smart beat Martina Emanuel 15 pts-7 pts. Still, fencing's never as good to watch as you'd think it would be.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Brit in the Philippines, Al Parkes,</strong> \"sympathises with the Brit in Kiwiland about the beach volleyball (had to endure hours of it here in Philippines, yesterday, too) but not about the boxing - we also got hours of that, but that's ok by me...\" I'm with you, Al. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/olympicsboxing.olympics20081\">Billy Jo Saunders</a>. What a guy.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>5.50 am:</strong> Just cos a few of you have asked about it. The medal table... It's nowt to do with me. It's been outsourced. No, really.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>5.55 am:</strong><strong> Badminton. </strong>In a seismic shuttlecock shock unseeded Japanese duo Maeda Miyuki and Suetsuna Satoko eliminated defending Olympic champions Yang Wei and Zhang Jiewen in the women's doubles. All eyes (and excruciating pressure) on men's top seed Lin Dan, who plays unseeded Ng Wei of Hong Kong. And Chinese tv watch, Steve George, reckons \"Joanna Harris should consider herself lucky, yesterday Chinese state television appeared to show nothing but 9 hours of back to back power lifting.\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>6.05 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>It's been a great day in the pool. Brits <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/swimming.olympics.britain\">Rebecca Aldington and Jo Jackson</a> brought home gold and bronze medals in the 400m freestyle. Though, sadly, there was no resurrection for Athens finalist Laure Manaudou. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/swimming.olympics.britain\">Marina Hyde</a>, wrote a fine piece on her extraordinary story in today's big paper. There's been plenty of drama. And at 7am 14 year-old Tom Daley will make his Olympic debut. Paul Kelso will be blogging from the poolside at 7. Join him <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/tom_daleys_olympic_debut_live.html \">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>6.15 am:</strong> <strong>Tennis. </strong>After a flat middle period, Rafael Nadal took the third set and the game to defeat Italian minnow Potito Starace. <strong>Women's basketball. </strong>The Czech Republic destroyed Mail 81-47.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>6.20 am:</strong> Foreign news round-up one. <strong>Weightlifting. </strong>Just looking through the foreign papers, if Laure Manaudou was the melodramatic/tragic story, Turkish weightlifter Sibel Ozkan is one of the uplifting ones. As you might remember, Ozkan came from nowhere to win silver in the surprisingly fruity 48kg medal class behind Chinese No.1 Chen Xiexia on the first day of the games. Raised in state care, she dedicated the medal to her dead mother as she was made 'State Sportsman' and received 2,000 gold pieces (worth about \u00a3240,000) from the Turkish government.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>6.30 AM:</strong> Foreign news round-up two. <strong>Swimming. </strong> The IOC have accepted the explanation of an Iranian swimmer, Mohammad Alirezaei, who withdrew from the heats of the men's 100-meter breaststroke on Saturday just before he was due to compete against a field that included Israel's Tom Beeri. Iran could have faced sanctions from the IOC if Alirezaei pulled out deliberately because an Israeli was also racing, but the IOC said no violation had been found.<br>\"The athlete has withdrawn because of sickness,\" said a spokesman. \"He confirmed this in writing to the swimming federation. We've also spoken with the national Olympic committee and they have underlined to us that all their athletes compete here in the right spirit against athletes from any nationality.\" Iran does not recognize Israel and bans any contact with the Jewish state. At the 2004 Athens Olympics, an Iranian judo athlete did not compete against an Israeli opponent, and Iranian government officials were quoted in state media as congratulating him for doing so.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>6.40 am:</strong> <strong>Britwatch. </strong> Charlotte Kerwood's Olympics is over, after finishing 16th in the qualifying for the women's trap final. Kerwood made her international debut at the Manchester Commonwealth games at the age of 15, she's a 21 year-old veteran now and a definite maybe for London 2012. Slovakia's Zuzana Stefecekova and Finland's Satu Makela-Nummela led the field.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Good morning, Gary Naylor. </strong> \"Catching up with the MBM Olympic report isn't easy pre-coffee, and is made all the more difficult by surprise medals,\" writes the undisputed Sir Steve Redgrave of the MBM Olympics. \"Things were easier when Team GB used to win just the one gold in the whole Games. This \"another day, another gold\" is all a bit much to be honest. Lewis Hamilton is shelving his Sports Personality of the Year acceptance speech for another year.\" I think Rebecca Aldington will need the 800m as well to secure that Sports Personality nomination, no? But Tom Daley has got the Young Sports Personality sewn up.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>6.50 AM:</strong> <strong>Brit-in-the-Baltics-perspective.</strong> Robin Hazlehurst in Estonia writes, \"Here in Estonia the national broadcaster has set up a second channel specially to show the Olympics, and now both channels are simultaneously showing beach volleyball, presumably just because Georgia are playing and this is an act of anti-Russian solidarity. There's no other reason, noone here cares about beach volleyball otherwise.\" You know, Kakum\u00e4e, V\u00e4\u00e4na-J\u00f5esuu and Lohusalu...

Anyway, get the rest of the news to date by signing up to our free email. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/thebeijinger\">The Beijinger</a>. Next up we have Tom Daley in the pool. <a href=\"http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/minder.htm\">Not Minder</a>. But the the 14 year-old diving sensation. <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/tom_daleys_olympic_debut_live.html\">Paul Kelso</a> is at poolside now.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Not everyone is excited about the diving, though.</strong> Not curmudgeonly Gary Naylor, for example. \"I know the IOC has all kinds of rules and regs (which essentially reduce to \"Will it work on telly?\")\", says Gary. \"But, ontologically, what is sport? For me anything that involves judges awarding points is more suited to a variant of the Eurovision Song Contest rather than the Olympics.\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Brit-in-the-antipodes-perspective III.</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>How the Australian media reported Rebecca Adlington's race. \"In the excitement of jumping up and down and going \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" for a while I forgot about the TV commentary on the 400m freestyle, over here in Australia,\" writes Martin Lyons. \"About 200m in (when Rebecca Adlington was last) the Aussie commentator was listing the top 3 swimmers, followed up by hyping the Australian in the race (who eventually came 6th) and then said \"as for the Brit Adlington, she's gone\", to which the other commentator replied \"Yeah, they've chewed her up and spat her out\".\"</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>7.30 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>Britain are underway. Aldridge and 14 year-old Daley score 52.8 on their first dive. Highly impressive. Just to let you know how it works - there are eight teams in the final - Australia, Cuba, Great Britain, Germany, USA, Colombia, China and Russia. Each pair performs six dives in rotation. China who have won 20 of the 32 titles in Olympic history are red hot favourites. Bronze would be a result for our (literally) boys.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>7.40 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>At the end of the first round China, lead from Russia and Australia, Germany and Britain, Blake Aldridge and Tom Daley, are tied fourth. The dives get progressively harder...</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>7.45 am:</strong> And the second Aldridge and Daley dive is a 50.4. This dive is a inward one-and-a-half somersault with pike. To my eyes, a bit out of time. (Though still mind-blowing.)</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>7.50 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>Several million eyes are on a boy from Devon with verruca socks and his partner whose name is destined to be forgotten. (It's Blake Aldridge.) How's he doing? Pretty well. At the end of the second round GB lie sixth. China lead, Russia are second and Australia and Germany are tied third. The Chinese are simply miles ahead. Their pair of divers look like they are tied together by string.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>7.55 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>Aldridge and Daley's third dive is a inward three-and-a-half-somersault tuck. The experts say they messed up the entry into the pool. It's a 72.96. Now it's time for a change in the hot seat. I'm off to bed and in comes Paolo Bandini, who I give a perfect 10.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>8am:</strong> Hello. I'll be tiding you over for the next three hours of tucks, pikes and ... er ... kayaking. All the focus is on the synchronised diving right now, but - if my hastily thrown together schedule is to be believed - we also have 49er and Yngling events kicking off just about now (Team GB involvement alert!), women's 58kg weightlifting and the trap final of the women's shooting.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>8.05am</strong> Fans of our ever-present standfirst (the grey bit underneath the headline) will already have spotted this, but for those who haven't, Paul Kelso is <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/tom_daleys_olympic_debut_live.html\"> giving the diving a far more knowledgeable treatment in his live blog</a>.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>8.10am</strong><strong>diving</strong> An impressively synchronised triple somersault (\"inward three-and-a-half tuck\", apparently) draws excited praise from our BBC commentary team, but there's a ruffle of the nose from Daley as he and Aldridge are awarded just 75.24 for their efforts. That leaves them seventh.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>8.12am</strong> Are they really playing Cotton-Eye Joe in the Bird's Nest? <em>Really</em>?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>8.16am</strong> I've always figured that a bronze medal must often be more satisfying than a silver. If you finish third then you're probably just going to have been pleased to have picked up a medal at all, rather than dwelling on the fact that you came so close to a gold but didn't get it. As if on cue to back up my half-baked theories, this story about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/feedarticle/7715689\">Chinese shooter Zhu Qinan weeping on the podium</a> after picking up silver in the 10m air rifle drops into my lap.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>8.19am</strong> <strong>Diving:</strong> Daley and Aldridge synchronise beautifully again, but they're not entering the water quite right, so again it's only a 77.52. Hopes of a medal are fading.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>8.24am</strong> \"That's an interesting theory you have about coming second/third,\" jabbers Joseph Bennett. \"But isn't the more interesting point here really just how much more pleasant life must be as a lottery-funded Brit rather than a Chinese competitor at these Games. Daley and Aldridge will probably get a heroes' welcome back home if they finish within five places of the podium.\" Yes, that too.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>8.27am</strong> Team GB's women's eight have finished second behind USA (repeat three times for emphasis) in the rowing, and will therefore have to get through the repechage tomorrow if they want a place in the final.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>8.29am</strong> Another splashy entry from the Brits, and they'll be lucky not to finish last now.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>8.37am</strong> \"Daley and Aldridge?\" exclaims Gary Naylor. \"Please don't write it like that. Those of us of a certain age are getting flashbacks to 80s football (Tony Daley and John Aldridge) and it's not very nice.\" It's alright Gary, I won't mention them again now, what with how they've finished in eighth. A dodgy last dive from China gives Russia a shot at gold, but it was only ever an extremely unlikely one and they can't manage it. Instead, Germany leap up to grab silver, and the Russians must settle for bronze. Which will, of course, be far more satisfying (see 8.16am).</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>8.42am</strong> The Beeb is showing replays of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/swimming.olympics.britain\">Rebecca Adlington's gold in the 400m freestyle\"</a>, so this seems as good a time as any to plug our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/thebeijinger\">informative daily Beijinger email</a>. It's full of fun, facts, and the word 'Olympics'.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>8.50am</strong> It's 64-64 in the women's preliminary basketball game between Russia and Korea, while the Italian Valentina Vezzali is through to the semi-finals of the women's fencing. If she can parry, riposte and perform various other sword-swishing motions better than fellow Italian Margherita Granbassi in the semi-final, and then one more opponent in the final, she'll become the first Italian ever to win gold at three different Olympics. That opponent could actually be yet another Italian, since Giovanna Trillini is in the other semi-final against Nam Hyunhee.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>9am</strong> Team GB's 49er team Stevie Morrison and Ben Rhodes are ninth with 41 points, which sounds like quite a lot behind Australia's Nathan Outteridge and Ben Austin on 13, but then I don't really understand how this is scored if I'm being honest. Explanations welcomed and appreciated. My colleague Alan Gardner has just walked in with an outrageous new moustache. It's quite distracting.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>9.05am</strong> The moustache is apparently in honour of Mark Spitz, the American swimmer whose seven gold medals in 1972 set the record which Michael Phelps is now trying to break. Alan thinks <a href=\"http://images.beijing2008.cn/01/75/Img211717501.jpg\">Spitz's was the greatest sporting moustache of all time</a>. For me the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/i/page2/photos/040414hrabosky.jpg\">former Atlanta Braves pitcher Al Hrabowsky</a> takes some beating.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>9.10am</strong> Back to the sailing and Ben Ainslie is doing rather well in the Finn. In fact he's won four of his last five races and is first on just seven points. Not bad for a man who said he was going to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/olympicssailing.olympics2008\">play it safe</a></p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>9.16am</strong> Britain's Alan Campbell is fourth in the quarter-finals of the men's single sculls but moving up through the field ...</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>9.17am</strong> And in the end he pushes on to finish a comfortable second behind Germany's Marcel Hacker, who looks very pleased with himself indeed. Hacker has been waiting quite some time to get one over on Campbell, but I dare say the Brit was fairly sensible to just pace himself and settle for second, given that there's still a semi-final and potentially a final to come.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>9.21am</strong> I'm hoping Gary Naylor had his tongue firmly in his cheek when he put forward <a href=\"http://img.skysports.com/08/03/800x600/GaryNeville_724859.jpg\">Gary Neville's shameful attempt at face fluff</a> for our great sporting moustaches contest. France's Gael Monfils is through to the second round of the men's tennis after beating Spain's Nicolas Almagro 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. Britain's very own Andy Murray is up at 10am against Chinese Taipei's Yen-Hsun Lu, who is currently ranked No77 in the world. They have never met before on the ATP Tour.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>9.30am</strong> Al Parkes is not the first person to suggest Merve Hughes for our moustache contest, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/ffximage/2006/12/20/mervehughes_narrowweb__300x361,0.jpg\">but he did include the best link</a>. Those of you wanting a break from all this moustache malarkey could do worse than checking out Barney Ronay's <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/premier_league_preview_no11_ma.html\">Premier League preview on Manchester United</a></p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>9.32am</strong> Britain's 'three blondes' - Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson - finished fourth in the fifth race of the women's yngling, leaving them joint-first with the Netherlands on 13 points.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>9.40am</strong> Apologies for the slightly belated reporting here, but Finland's Satu Makela-Nummela took gold in the women's trap shooting earlier on, and even set an Olympic record along the way by hitting 21 targets in the final. Slovakia's Zuzana Stefecekova took silver and USA's Corey Cogdell took bronze.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>9.46am</strong> You* will be excited to hear that Italy are through to the finals of the men's archery after crushing Ukraine 223-221. In more sombre news, Anatoly Khrapaty, a weight-lifting gold medallist for the USSR in 1988, has been killed at the age of just 45 in a motorcycle accident. </p> <p>* I</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>9.50am</strong> It's all coming up Italy right now - I've just found out they've also beaten Russia in a women's water polo preliminary too. Russia finally overcame Korea 77-72 in the women's basketball, while Latvia are 13-12 up against Belarus in the same event.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>9.54am</strong> Gary Naylor's back, and this time he's angry. \"Women's trap shooting? Why a separate competition,\" he booms. \"Likewise archery and indeed several other sports - anachronistic nonsense. Women and men should compete against each other on a 'level playing field' unless there are proveable physical reasons why the playing field isn't level (eg swimming, athletics etc).\"</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>10am</strong> The official Beijing website is utterly useless when it comes to sailing results - right now they have nothing up for any of the races, beyond a starting list of competitors and the word 'unofficial' where the results should be. Our super newswires, however, inform me that Ainslie did indeed finish the day in first place as did the women's yngling team \"after another pair of solid performances\". They boast leads of one and three points respectively. In the 49er class, however, Stevie Morrison and Ben Rhodes, managed to slip from first to ninth despite being the 2007 world champions.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>10.05am</strong> There's windsurfing news too - Britain's Bryony Shaw, who won the test event here last year, is third in the RS:X women's category, while Nick Dempsey is ninth in the men's competition.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>10.10am</strong> \"David Wilkie was just a bit behind Spitz in gold medals and face furniture,\" pipes up Gary Naylor, putting his equal-opportunities bluster behind him to get back to the more pressing issue of facial hair. \"<a href=\"http://cache.viewimages.com/xc/3318044.jpg?v=1&amp;c=ViewImages&amp;k=2&amp;d=11B127B063386F61C80E5920C1CC8592A55A1E4F32AD3138\">Decent effort on both counts though</a>.\"</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>10.15am</strong> Ah kayaking - like rowing, only better (strong current, white water, high potential for drowning - what's not to like)? Campbell Walsh was supposed to be one of Britain's biggest medal hopes here, having taken silver in Athens, but a dodgy first run, picking up two penalty points. He's ninth at the minute and needs to stay in the top 15 after two runs to progress.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>10.20am</strong> Murray is 2-1 up, but I've been disappointed by the lack of over-enthusiastic middle-England support. Perhaps they're being drowned out by both players' absurdly squeaky shoes. Not enough fist pumping for my liking either.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>10.25am</strong> Walsh has finished 14th in the first round of the K1. Not great.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>10.30am</strong> A big thank-you to Gavin Brown, who has pointed me in the direction of <a href=\"www.sailing.org/olympics\">this website</a>, which seems to be fairly comprehensive and up to speed when it comes to the sailing results. They're all done for today now anyway, but will doubtless come in handy again over the next few days. Murray is 3-2 up and the match has so far gone with serve.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>10.32 am</strong> Scratch that - Murray just broke for the first time and leads 4-2.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>10.34am</strong> China's Chen Yanqing has won the women's 58kg weightlifting competition. They now have eight golds - five more than anybody else. China also claimed bronze in the men's team archery with a 222-219 win over Ukraine. Italy are playing Korea in the final now.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>10.38</strong> More good news for Team GB as David Florence finishes third after two heats in the C1 canoe slalom to make the semi-finals with ease.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>10.43</strong> Britain's men's coxless pair of Robin Bourne-Taylor and Tom Solesbury are out after finishing fourth in the repecharge.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>10.47am</strong> I return to the tennis to find that Murray has now broken Lu twice, only to swiftly drop his own serve on both occasions. He leads 5-4, with Lu serving to stay in the set.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>10.51am</strong> Korea have beaten Italy 227-225 in the final of the men's archery, which by my reckoning puts them second in the gold medal count with four.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>10.55am</strong> Murray really isn't making light work of things against Lu, and he is taken to deuce before holding serve to take a 6-5 lead. Britain's Elise Laverick and Anna Bebington are through to the final of the women's double sculls after winning the repecharge.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>11.05am</strong> The picture is ahead of the sound on the BBC's coverage of the Murray match, which makes for quite an odd viewing experience. I've watched sport before where the opposite is true, but never quite like this. Lu holds to force a tie-break after saving three set points on deuce. Murray's body language is not especially encouraging - it's very hot on court and he looks quite lethargic. He has relied heavily on unforced errors from Lu to this point.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>11.12am</strong> Lu takes the tie-break 7-5 to shrieks of what I can only assume is the Chinese equivalent of \"come on Tim\". It was a bizarre end to the set actually - Murray double-faulted, but there was confusion over whether his second serve had been called in or not and both players were made to hang about for a few minutes while the umpire called the Hawkeye team, only to discover it wasn't working. In the end Murray was told it had been called out, and that would stand. Anyway, Murray is in trouble here - he's really not playing that well. You, however, are in very good hands, as I am now passing this minute-by-minute over to my esteemed colleague Tom Bryant.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>11.20am:</strong> Morning all. As I take over typing duties, Campbell Walsh is bobbing about like a cork in a waterfall in the white waters of canoeing course. He finally crosses the line with 172.44 to come in fifth which should mean he qualifies for the next round - or say they're saying on the telly - I've been watching Andy Murray begin his inevitable first game exit from the Olympics so haven't been concentrating too hard.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>11.25am:</strong> There's wild excitement in the badminton court - or at least you'd think so from the terrifying chanting that appears to be going on there. Brit Andrew Smith is taking on Marc Zwieber and is currently one game up but losing the second 13-9. Andy Murray, meanwhile, is trying to get off the court as it's started raining but the umpire won't let him as he doesn't think it's hard enough.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>11.30am:</strong> In the badminton, Smith (who looks a bit like John Arne Riise) is taking the shuttle early at the front of the court which is a good thing, by all accounts. It doesn't help him save the second game, though, as Zwieber draws level on one game all The furious chanting is still going on but bears no relation to this game, which means there's probably a far more exciting one elsewhere in the building, albeit one that doesn't involve a Brit and is therefore not being shown by the Beeb.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>11.32am:</strong> Ah. An apology. All that badminton happened ages ago. At 4am. And Smith lost badly. That's the peril of assuming that what you're watching is live when it isn't. What a brilliant start I've made to all of this. In other news you may not have caught up on - the allies won the war and England won the 1966 World Cup.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>11.36am:</strong> Something that very much is happening at the moment is Andy Murray heading into that dark place in his head while some unknown shows him how to play tennis. He's 2-1 down in the second set, having lost the first two games and then breaking back.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>11.39am:</strong> Murray's problem are - apparently - his short balls. By which, he's not hitting the tennis ball far enough. Why? What were you thinking? Campbell Walsh, in the canoeing, qualified from his heat in ninth place, so that's a good thing.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>11.44am:</strong> An email. Hurrah. \"Do tennis players really take the Olympics seriously,\" asks Jim Thompson, not unreasonably given Murray's showing so far. \"Is winning a gold medal as important a spur to them as winning at somewhere like Wimbledon?\" I don't think it is, to be honest. I'm always surprised by how many big players turn out - but then, according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/tennis.olympics.nadal\">this report from Will Buckley</a>, the Chinese love a bit of tennis.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>11.46pm:</strong> Sharron Davies is talking away on the telly about the fantastic success in the swimming this morning. The BBC cameraman is scrupulously zooming in very closely on her head, not allowing his lens to show anything but her face. <a href=\"http://observer.theguardian.com/osm/story/0,,1677787,00.html\">Wonder why that is</a>.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>11.51am:</strong> \"I think that the tennis players suffer The Olympics because of their sponsors' contracts,\" reckons Gary Naylor. \"They don't seem to care much and (perhaps I'm being charitable) look embarrassed about taking the limelight away from those for whom The Olympics is the pinnacle of their careers.\" Murray certainly looks like he's suffering at the moment - after an epic deuce battle to go back to 2-2 in the second set, he looks absolutely shattered and is spending a good deal of time grimacing as his gammy knee gives him jip.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>11.53am:</strong> Aside from the tennis, there's much going on at the moment. A quick glance shows lots of women in wetsuit-ish swimming costumes ploughing up and down the pool (where Brit Caitlan McClatchey has come second in the 200m freestyle heat), two women in judo suits grappling with each other and others playing hockey, sailing and jabbing at each other with swords. </p> <p>Also, there this: \"I agree with Gary Naylor that there is something not quite right about events which require judges to award points,\" says Paul Smith of the ever prodigious Mr Naylor's comments at just 7.20am this morning - proving that Paul Smith is just as much behind the times as I was a few minutes ago. \"Of more interest/concern though is that, as far as I can work out, diving is the only such event which has not been made into 'Celebrity Synchronised Diving'. No idea who would host it but some of the potential combinations are delicious - both technically and aesthetically.\" Any suggestions?</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>12.05pm:</strong> The featherweight and lightweight boxing preliminaries are underway and Santos from Mexico and Okoth from Kenya are busy knocking seven shades out of each other. The Mexican is 3-2 up after the second round. Meanwhile Federica Pelligrini has just smashed the 200m freestyle world record after clocking 1min 55.45 seconds. Well done her.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>12.10pm:</strong> \"Further to the comments of Gary Naylor and Paul Smith re what defines a sport, I would like to say that if you can play it without changing your shoes, its not a sport,\" emails Jimmy Shaker - which, by that reckoning, makes diving a sport as you should probably remove your shoes before entering the pool. My assessment of what makes a sport is whether you can do it with a cigarette in your hand - therefore snooker, darts and cricket are not sports.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>12.15pm:</strong> It's going from bad to worse for Murray. Not only is it four games all in the second set, he's also battling fatigue, a bad knee and the inner demons to whom he seems to have started talking - going by the constant muttering with which he's greeting each point.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>12.17pm:</strong> Santos has clinched his bout about against Okoth and, with his face mask off, he appears to be all of about 10 years old. Elsewhere, Italian Giulia Quintavalle has claimed the gold in the women's 57kg judo after beating Deborah Gravenstijn from the Netherlands.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>12.21pm:</strong> World number 77, Lu Yen-Hsu, has just knocked Andy Murray out of the Olympics in straight sets. That really is appalling from Murray. Expect Murray to be referred to as only a Scot rather than a Briton for the next two weeks.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>12.25pm:</strong> The commentators are gamely talking up how well Lu Yen-Hsu has played - and rightfully so - but, honestly, Murray played shockingly badly. He barely looked interested, was as mobile as a sloth and seemed never to have really been in this. He'll be out later in the doubles with his brother, so he can have the ignominy of crashing out twice, if he carries on like this.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>12.30pm:</strong> Ah, the butterfly. The most ludicrous of swimming strokes. And isn't it always brilliant when someone down the municipal pool attempts it while you're lamely doggy paddling down the slow lane? Anyway, there's a 200m butterfly heat underway at the moment and the British interest involves Michael Rock who's not doing badly. In fact, he's done rather well and has finished in third with 1:55.55, which is just outside the British record and is a huge personal best.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>12.33pm:</strong> \"I think you're being harsh on Andy Murray,\" says Colin Stevens. \"The guy has just come through consecutive weeks of Masters tennis held in baking heat and humidity, winning one and getting to the semis in the other. Peter Fleming early on in the last tournament said that whoever won that would have no chance in the Olympics. Might be why Federer got knocked out early.\" Yeah, but to slump out to the world number 77 so lamely is what's depressing. There was just no fight.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>12.35pm:</strong> Phelps is off like a flailing dolphin in his 200m butterfly heat - well, like an extremely effective, winning machine-like flailing dolphin. He hit the turn on 150m in sixth and then came back to win in the last length and casually set a new Olympic record of 1:53.7 while he was at it. Extraordinary.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>12.39pm:</strong> \"Contrary to your comments, darts appears to be the ultimate sport,\" insists Kevin McKenzie. \"In competitions, you have to wear black shoes at the oche, you can no longer smoke indoors, and theres no judge deciding on your score. Could darts be the ultimate sport?\" Hmm, it's beating cricket under those terms. Meanwhile, Jo Jackson has joined Caitlin McClatchey in the semi-finals of the 200m freestyle after winning bronze this morning in the 400m freestyle. Good on her.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>12.41pm:</strong> The men's 62kg weightlifting is reaching its exciting pinnacle. There's a lot of shouting, a fair bit of grunting and some very peculiar body-shapes on display. 140kg is where the weight is at currently and a lot of men who I , personally, wouldn't mess with are struggling to lift it.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>12.47pm:</strong> The Korean Ji Hunmin is the talcum powder and shouting king currently. He's just lifted 142kg, something which the pleasingly alliterative Chinese contender, Zhang Xiangxiang, can't lift it himself, despite the entire crowd roaring at him. Meanwhile Chris Brock has sent me a very amusing email on the subject of one particular person who would make a worrying celebrity diving partner. Unfortunately, unless I want to spend the next few month of my life in court, I can't print it. Pity.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>12.49pm:</strong> Ah, but Xiangxiang has come out again and had another go, this time lifting 143kg. So, well done him.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>12.52pm:</strong> In the judo, Azerbaijan's Elnur Mammadli has clinched gold in the 73kg men's category after taking only 13 seconds to knock teenage world champion Wang Kichun of South Korea out of the reckoning. Tajikistan's Rasul Boqiev won bronze after beating Dirk van Tichelet of Belgium. My advice is to steer clear of all four of them if you ever see them in a bad mood.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>12.55pm:</strong> Back to the pool, where Brit Keri-Ann Payne has come in seventh in the 200m individual medley heat but was up at the front alongside hot favourite Natalie Coughlin for initial stages. Her time is good but maybe not good enough for the final. Hoff races in the next heat and she'll certainly be the person everyone wants to beat.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>12.59pm:</strong> Actually, the backstroke is quite silly too. Not as silly as the butterfly, but still fairly silly. Hoff possibly thinks so as her backstroke length lets her down a bit in the fourth of the women's 200m individual medley but, still she comes second to Australian Alicia Coutts. After that heat, Payne has slipped down to tenth but could still make the semis.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>1.04pm:</strong> Back in the boxing - the men's lightweight (60kg) round of 32: Match 4, to be absolutely precise - Domenico Valentino of Italy has creamed Tahar Tamsamani 15-4. He'll have a sore head in the morning. In the pool, Brit Hannah Miley has continued Team GB's good day in the pool by winning heat five of the 200m individual medley in a time of 2:11.72. She looks delighted with herself too, and well she might as she's now fourth in the semi-final. Payne is through too.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>1.09pm:</strong> \"Here in Sweden, the telly is showing some boxing where one of the competitors rejoices in the name Prince Octopus Dzaine,\" writes Gary Naylor of the Ghanaian boxer (it says on t'internet) . \"Disappointingly, he has just the two arms.\" It would be something of an unfair advantage should he have had eight, though extremely entertaining to warch.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>1.12pm:</strong> Bix Mistry has suggested: \"Dawn French and Peter Crouch, Darth Vader and an Ewok or Robert Mugabe and Gordon Brown,\" for the celebrity diving. I'd rather see Cristiano Ronaldo and Didier Drogba - they're certainly got form. Honk!</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>1.18pm:</strong> Nikoloz Izoria and Thato Batshegi, from Georgia and Botswana respectively, are clattering each other all over the boxing ring. The Georgian is 10-4 ahead in the second round but manages to find time to stop and do up his shoe laces. He's also got a nasty graze under his eye. Bathshegi is going at him like a drunk on a Saturday night - all agression, flailing arms, wild attacks and not much contact - while Izoria is concentrating on actually doing some boxing.</p> <p>Unfortunately for British badminton player Tracey Hallam, her Olympics are over. She's been knocked out by Xu Huaiwen who, despite her name, mystifyingly appears to be from Germany.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>1.24pm:</strong> Batshegi has decided he's had enough of being punched in the head and has, instead, decided to wrestle Izoria to the ground. I'm no boxing expert but I'd say that's probably not Queensberry Rules. Next he batters the Georgian around the back of the head, which doesn't seem quite right either. </p> <p>On the subject of sports with judges, Phil Mannion has this to say: \"I once passed an enjoyable afternoon in the pub with a friend thinking of ways judging could be eliminated from sport. Most of our innovations now escape me, but I've always thought our re-imagining of synchronised swimming as a gruelling endurance slog, where the winners are the last team still underwater-pirouetting when the rest have given up/drowned, was potentially the same sort of televisual gold as Touch The Truck with Dale Winton.\"</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>1.27pm:</strong> The referee has decided that the slight bruising to Izoria's eye is enough to stop the bout for a bit. He seems less concerned by the Botswanan's attempts to turn this into a wrestling contest, however. The scoring seems a bit iffy, too. Batshegi finally connected with a good punch and failed to score, before Izoria does the same three times more and doesn't get a point either. It finishes 14-4 to the Georgian.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>1.28pm:</strong> U-S-A, U-S-A are stomping all over China in the women's basketball and are currently up 45-14 with five minutes remaining in the half. Which half? I'm not sure at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>1.33pm:</strong> The Chinese are not going down without a fight though. Despite being about half the size of most of the Americans, they're giving it good go. It's not going to work though, I'd wager. U-S-A, U-S-A are now 54-22 ahead with only a minute and half to go of the half. Which half? Still don't know.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>1.37pm:</strong> Ah, it was the first half. China are out of this already. Let's move on somewhere else.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>1.38pm:</strong> Apologies again. It appears the website is not updating. So all of these carefully worded vignettes have not been appearing, which has probably only improved the overall report. Whether this apology will also appear is also in doubt - but it's the thought that counts, eh?</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>1.45pm:</strong> Good lord, they're still lifting insane weights in what I can only presume is called the weight-lifting arena. Alliterative dream, Zhang Xiangxiang, is attempting to lift 184kg - a weight that would be a new world record. He's already the gold medal winner. He approaches the stand, looking knackered, scoops the weights up to his neck ... and ... drops them back on the floor, unable to lift them any higher. Still, that was a very impressive contest from the Chinaman.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>1.48pm:</strong> Ah, it would appear the site is working again. Good stuff. Right, in the men's 62kg weightlifting, the winner is Zhang Xiangxiang, Diego Salazar of Colombia can hang the silver medal from his mantelpiece, while Indonesia's Triyatno will have to settle for bronze.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>1.55pm:</strong> It's U-S-A, U-S-A against Romania in the boxing ring in the shape of Georgian Popescu v American teenager Sadam Ali and it's shaping up to be quite a bout for the Romanian. He's absolutely clonking Ali and has landed some weighty lefts on Ali's face - enough to knock the American to the floor. Going into the third round, Popescu leads 9-3, which means yet another American boxer could be on his way home.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>1.58pm:</strong> As boxing contests go, this is not the most technically brilliant. There have been one or two air shots, some wild, whirling arms and the odd landed punch - mostly from the American. In return, he's getting a real whooping. Popescu is absolutely killing him. At the end of the third, the Romanian leads 16-5. Ali needs a knockout or a miracle to stay in this.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>2.03pm:</strong> Some fencing news: Margherita Granbassi from Italy has beaten fellow Italian Giovanni Trillini to the bronze medal in the women's individual foil by 15 points to 12. Meanwhile, Popescu has finished his demolition of Ali and will no doubt take a certain amount of pleasure in having sent the second American boxer of the contest back home.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>2.07pm:</strong> Ah - the mystery of the badminton player who is mystifyingly German despite all the evidence of her name name has been solved. Xu Huaiwen was a Chinese citizen who was dropped by the Chinese team because she was too short. She moved to Germany, got into their team, and is now back in China showing her homeland what they have missed out on. None of which changes things for Briton Tracey Hallam, who Xu beat, as she's still on her way home.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>2.12pm:</strong> Having written the Chinese women basketball players off, they're doing their best to make me eat my words. At the end of the third quarter they've fought back to leave the score at 46-81 to U-S-A. They can still count on packing their unfeasibly long t-shirts and shorts tonight but they'll do so having put on a decent showing.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>2.17pm:</strong> There's some hot breaking women's beach volleyball news ... well, it's news, anyway. In the preliminary competition, pool C, match 3, Ana Paula Connelly and Larissa Franca (Brazil) beat Paula Uryadova and Alexandra Shiryaeva (Russia) 2-1 (19-21 21-12 15-13). Take that down the pub and impress your mates.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>2.20pm:</strong> Elsewhere, Maria Valentina Vezzali has won he women's individual foil gold after beating South Korea's Nam Hyun-hee (who took silver). She's a bit special, is Maria Valentina and this gold means she's taken that medal home at three individual Olympics. Sort of like the Steve Redgrave of Italy. But in fencing. And not quite as good.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> The tennis courts are swelteringly hot - leading to players having to change their shirts constantly throughout. That's the reason Murray did so badly earlier, apparently. Hmmm. On the court at the moment Svetlana Kuznetsova is a set down against Li Na, but two games up in the second set.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> We'll see just how worn out Andy Murray is when he comes on to the court alongside brother Jamie a bit later on. Meanwhile Li Na is banking on home support to get her through her match against Kuznetsova. The Chinese woman is absolutely throwing the kitchen sink at her rival and, so far, it seems to be working.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> \"Grrr,\" \"Ungghh,\" \"Oof,\" \"Owwwll,\" or noises to that affect are what you'd be hearing if you were watching Kuznetsova try and get back on level terms with Li Na, where the score is now two games-all in the second set.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>2.44pm:</strong> Valentina Vezzali says her unprecedented fencing success is down to her son Pietro. \"I have to first off all thank my little boy Pietro,\" without going on to elaborate. Still, that's her third successive gold and sixth overall - the most for any female fencer ever.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>2.49pm:</strong> Bad news in the tennis - well, bad news if you happen to be defending men's doubles champions Fernando Gonzalez and Nicolas Massu of Chile. They were beaten 7-6 6-4 by Russians Dmitry Tursunov and Mikhail Youzhny. In Athens Gonzalez and Massu won Chile its first ever gold medal but obviously couldn't repeat the feat again. The Murrays are due up in five minutes - any predictions for how many times Andy will shout at his older brother?</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>2.56pm:</strong> It's bad news for Kuznetsova, too. She's looking thoroughly deflated. Despite being the world number 3, she's in the process of crashing out of the Olympics to the Chinese number two Li Na. \"The question is not how many times Andy Murray will shout at his brother but how soon,\" reckons Tim carter. \"I'm banking on the abuse starting in the changing room.\"</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>2.58pm:</strong> Li Na, who has barely cracked a smile all match, doesn't appear to be dropping the hardman exterior now. She looks positively stony-faced as she fails to finish this match off. She's 5-3 up in the second set and stuck on deuce. Meanwhile, U-S-A have finally completed their rout over the Chinese women's basketball team, winning 108-63. That was probably quite inevitable.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>3.01pm:</strong> Kuznetsova comes back to win the game, bringing the score to 5-4. In the background, Chumbawumba's (whose tour bus I once climbed into, for no real reason) Tubthumping blares out of the arena's PA. I cannot think of a single reason why that should be.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>3.04pm:</strong> And Li Na's finally done it and has won in straight sets. Well done her. Still doesn't make her smile though. Should you want to know what it's like to row at the Olympics, you could do a lot worse than clicking <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/one_down_two_to_go_in_my_quest.html\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>3.07pm:</strong> The Murrays are on court and facing Canadian pairing Daniel Nestor and Frederic Nestor. Andy looks knackered, Jamie not so much. But, despite a stunning series of net-cord volleying from the Murrays when 15-30 up in the first game, the Canadians go on to get th first points on the board.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> It's a game-all now in the men's doubles, and there's been a disappointing lack of on-court shouting so far. Ah well, there's still time.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>3.17pm:</strong> In the cricket, Freddie Flintoff has just won the game for England with a big, straight six, so England win by six wickets. In Beijing, Albert Selimov, the favourite in the featherweight division, has just been knocked out - of the competition, not knocked unconscious - by Ukraine's Vasyl Lomachenko. That'll hurt.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>3.19pm:</strong> Rather than shouting, the Murrays are whispering to each other behind their hands like the Williams sisters. It seems to be working as every one of the four games they've played has gone with serve. It's 2-2 and Andy Murray has already got quite a sweat on.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> It's with a peculiar \"Phheee\" sound that Nestor unleashes his serves. It seems to do the trick, though. He wins that game for the Canadians to love. The arena is virtually empty, showing you just how much the Chinese care about this. Andy Murray then slaps down a decent, if half-hearted, service game to level the scores at 3-3 again. I'm not sure he really cares much about this.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>3.29pm:</strong> The Canadian pair, rather than just whisper under their breath, are indulging in a series of complicated hand signals which seem to be confusing them as much as anything else. It's like doing semaphore to a blind man. It means the Murrays get themselves three break points - all of which they blow - before the game goes to deuce and the Canadians hold serve again.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>3.34pm:</strong> There are a pitiful handful of spectators watching this game - all of whom seem to be middle-aged women from the home counties. Strange. They watch on as Jamie Murray holds his serve, taking the score to 4-4 in the first set. Russia, meanwhile, have beaten Sweden 28-24 in the handball preliminary round, you'll be pleased to learn.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>3.41pm:</strong> It would appear the site has gone down again. Bah. Stay with us, it'll get better. Maybe. </p> <p>Canada survive a Murray pummeling, thanks to Nestor's excellent anticipation. What appeared to be an unplayable Andy Murray shot down the line was amazingly returned by the Canadian. Two points later, with the scores at deuce, Andy lets out his first shout. \"Rraarrr,\" he yells as he screws his shot into the net. He does the same thing a little later when he puts another into the net as Canada take the game. The score's 5-4 to them, now.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>3.45pm:</strong> Facing three set points, after going 0-40 down at 4-5, Andy Murray throws the ball into the air and smashes it far too long. His second serve goes straight into the net and the Canadians claim the first set. Murray 'celebrates' by smashing his racket into the ground, while his brother just looks despairing.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> Should you get tired of the, ahem, word pictures being drawn here, you can look at actual pictures <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/11/olympics2008\">here</a> of the best shots from day three of the Olympics. On the court, you'd struggle to find anyone looking less bothered than the Murray's right now. Despite Andy's ocasional shouts and racket slams, they don't look like they could care less. Having said that, they have just broken the Canadians in the first game of the second set.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>3.54pm:</strong> Sean Ingle has spent much of his afternoon chasing new British swimming hero Rebecca Adlington around Beijing. The results? He rekons she's quite nice. You can make your own mind up by following <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/the_joy_of_the_olympics_is_how.html\">this link</a>, of course.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>3.57pm:</strong> Finally, the Murrays are beginning to make a fist of this. They fight back from 15-40 down to get to deuce - courtesy of a Nestor double fault - but can't go on to break the pair again. It's 2-1 to the Murrays who are still a set down in the second set. Meanwhile long-jumper Chris Tomlinson has passed a fitness test and has been passed fit to compete in Beijing - which is good news.</p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>4pm:</strong> Hmm, or perhaps I've spoken too soon. The next game, on Andy's serve, finds the brothers at 0-40 down. They fight back to 30-40 but a brilliant return from Nestor brings the scores level. That's the second service game that Andy Murray has lost.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>4.03pm:</strong> The Murrays break back, as the strains of a cover version of Sweet Child O'Mine blare from the speakers in the empty tennis arena. The score is 3-2 to the Scottish pair in the second set.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>4.10pm:</strong> Jamie Murray just about manages to cling on to his serve, taking the score to 4-2. It really is extraordinary how few people are watching this game. It may not be the greatest game tennis has ever seen but Andy Murray is a big name and Nestor, for one, is a very good doubles player so you'd have thought it would be more of a draw than it's proving. Perhaps it needs more trick shots - something Andy tries when he returns a Nestor forehand by facing the wrong way and playing the ball behind his back.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>4.16pm:</strong> After the Canadians hold their serve, the Murrays maintain their advantage after a a brutal, two-handed forehand club from the net from Jamie Murray wins them the next game. They're 5-3 up in the second set now and facing Niemeyer's serve.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>4.20pm:</strong> The Murrays land themselves with two set points but can do nothing with the first when Niemeyer forces Jamie Murray wide with his serve. His lobbed return is smashed back by Nestor before Niemeyer serves up an ace to Andy take the score to deuce. From deuce, the Murrays battle to advantage and win the second set. Game on.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>4.25pm:</strong> The first people to jump on the/cash in on the Adlington band-wagon are ... Sherwood Swimming Baths in Mansfield Woodhouse. The pool at which the Olympic gold medallist learned to swim aged six will be closed down and reopened as the Rebecca Adlington Swimming Centre, according to the town mayor. Adlington will also be pleased to know she will be able to do such things as drive sheep through the city centre when she's given the Freedom Of Mansfield, too. That medal will soon begin to look worthless in the face of such honours.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>4.30pm:</strong> The first two games of the set go with service, making the score 1-1, though Niemeyer's serve is looking ever-more vulnerable. The Murrays still don't look particularly interested in this but at least they're putting together some decent shots now. They are, however, barely looking or talking to each other - leading to speculation in the commentary box that Jamie is worried about annoying Andy and sending him into a rage after his defeat this morning.</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>4.35pm</strong> Nestor has to battle to win his serve after finding himself staring down the wrong end of a 0-40 scoreline. The Canadians get back to 15-40, before Nestor double faults and the Murrays go 3-1 ahead.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>4.38pm:</strong> The Murrays have this within their sights now. They're now 4-1 up in the final set and, despite both looking as glum as octogenarian pessimists, they're finally got their mojo working. They've also got Niemeyer's serve to face, which has been weak so far.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>4.45pm:</strong> But Niemeyer holds his serve for once, forcing Andy Murray into s service game in which both Canadians return well. A mistake by Jamie Murray at the net doesn't much help his brother's cause. Andy decides to blast a couple of serves instead and the result is that the Murrays take the game and go into a 5-2 lead. It's 11.45pm in Beijing at the moment - which perhaps explains why nobody is watching this.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>4.48pm:</strong> A delicate drop shot down the line takes the Canadians to 40-15 and prolongs this match by another game. After typing solidly for six hours, I could have done without that, to be honest. Bah. Hopefully Jamie Murray can serve it out for the win nd we can all go home.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p><strong>4.53pm:</strong> An ace at 15-15 from Jamie starts the ball rolling but then, at 30-15, they concoct some elaborate plan that involves much talking behind hands before cocking up the point like clowns. Next minute the Canadians are 30-40 up and the damn match looks like it will never die. Then, just as it's all going wrong, Andy Murray dives across the net and slams Niemeyer's return home with a war cry. It's deuce ...</p> <!-- Block 174 --> <p><strong>4.54pm:</strong> ... and inevitably the Canadians break back and prolong this misery. It's 5-4 to the Murrays in the third set.</p> <!-- Block 175 --> <p><strong>4.55pm:</strong> A double fault from Niemeyer. Yes! That helps. He follows it up by sticking a half-volley into the net. 0-30 to the Murrays.</p> <!-- Block 176 --> <p><strong>4.59pm:</strong> With a sharp forehand, Andy Murray takes the score to 0-40 and brings the demise of this damn game nearer ... until the Canadians ruin it by having the temerity to win a point from their own serve. Then, ridiculously, they do it again. But, finally, the Murrays claim the win and they're through to the next round. You'd have thought that would cheer Andy Murray up after his loss earlier. From the grimace on his face, you'd be wrong.</p> <!-- Block 177 --> <p><strong>5pm:</strong> And with that, so ends this epic Olympic minute-by-minute. Thanks for all your emails - join as again for another one, which we'll be gearing up at around 2am tomorrow morning.</p>",
  "<p>As if they were not busy enough striving for trophies, the top four have to deliver major stories as well. At least Chelsea put their heart and soul into the mission and never shy away from melodrama. Luiz Felipe Scolari is the third person in under a year to be Stamford Bridge manager so it is as well that he is the master of acclimatisation, having been in charge of clubs in Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Japan.</p> <p>Scolari has done well enough to enjoy a permanent place among the elite in his profession. Nobody pulls rank on someone who has won the World Cup. His standing was unharmed as manager of Portugal when there was a curious tolerance of the team's defeats, as hosts, to Greece in the games that opened and closed Euro 2004. Overall, Scolari has no apologies to make for his CV.</p> <p>For all the rhetoric about the ravishing football supposedly insisted upon by Chelsea's owner, Roman Abramovich, there has always been beauty enough for Scolari in winning ugly. It was only the critics who winced when his Gremio side, with its roughhouse habits, took the Copa Libertadores in 1995. Scolari is not dissimilar to Jose Mourinho and Chelsea fans will be cheered if he is better at tending the relationship with the owner.</p> <p>His problem lies in the fact that Chelsea are a less composed side now after being runners-up to Manchester United in successive campaigns. Losing the Champions League final to them was a further dose of misery. Sir Alex Ferguson's hurtful musings about Chelsea's prospects led to some totting up of the ages of the respective squads at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge, but his real insinuation was that Scolari's group had slender scope for development.</p> <p>At trophyless Chelsea, the Brazilian will have to work hard to convince his players that they are really capable of regaining domination of English football. Ferguson's assignment is the converse of that. He is the only manager to have won the Premier League title in three consecutive seasons and now has to remember quite how he preserved the freshness. The difficulty is exacerbated because surgery has ruled Cristiano Ronaldo out of the start of the programme, even if United could be scornful about Real Madrid's efforts to whisk him away forever.</p> <p>Longevity of achievement comes when there are additional figures ready to dominate. It would have been folly to assume that Ronaldo would offer as much for a second year in a row even if he were utterly committed to United and totally fit. Eyes were bound to settle on Wayne Rooney, who has been a paragon of industry and humility.</p> <p>Some, surely including Ferguson, still wish for echoes of the explosive self-confidence he had as a youth at, for example, Euro 2004. The manager was happy to muse recently on the importance of finding a role that really suits Rooney. It is an exercise whose outcome will also matter to Fabio Capello as England settle down to World Cup qualifiers.</p> <p>Premier League rivals would prefer the low-profile Rooney since life is already hard enough without him on the rampage. The strain is felt almost everywhere. Even if the top four is viewed as a league apart, its bottom two clubs, Arsenal and Liverpool, might wince at the notion of being relegated from it.</p> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has had a lot to reckon with and while he is not the type to rail against his employers, the need to pay off the Emirates Stadium has its impact on the wages or transfer fees that can be agreed. Morale, for all that, may be improved by an opening stretch of amenable fixtures. The club's usual low-key build-up to the season could also be an advantage since they have avoided the debilitating travels of United and Chelsea, who seemed on a global treasure hunt in July, looking for long-term marketing income.</p> <p>Liverpool met a high price when agreeing to pay Tottenham \u00a320.3m for Robbie Keane, but the extra power in attack, and the option of switching from 4-2-3-1 to a gung-ho 4-4-2 against the weaker sides, with the Irishman pushed up from a deeper role to partner Fernando Torres, might save the club from drawing over a third of their League matches, as they did last season. It remains to be seen if new full-backs will endow Liverpool with the deftness which is sometimes lacking on their flanks.</p> <p>They cannot afford miscalculations. Everton, despite limited means, came fifth last year and several others see themselves surging nearer the top. Portsmouth, with Peter Crouch to partner Jermain Defoe in attack, are on the move. Aston Villa, too, could rise although expanding the squad has been a demanding project. There is the same craving for progress at West Ham and at Fulham, where the outlay has been eye-catching this summer. Roy Keane, with Sunderland, committed himself to a recruitment spree.</p> <p>Tottenham were also in the mood to galvanise themselves from the moment they concluded that the Croatian midfielder Luka Modric's energy and skill would compensate for his lack of heft. Exciting as Juande Ramos's retooled line-up should be, the solidity of the defence is crucial and there will be relief if Ledley King's troublesome knee allows him to appear regularly.</p> <p>The potential of Manchester City under the management of Mark Hughes, so long as he is in harmony with Thaksin Shinawatra, was made manifest in the \u00a318m purchase of the Brazilian striker Jo from CSKA Moscow. Hughes may have put himself on the side of the wealthy at just the right moment, stepping down at Blackburn as some important players there approached the final year of their contracts. Paul Ince, his successor at Ewood Park, will have excelled if he keeps the club stable.</p> <p>There are severe tests elsewhere and Kevin Keegan's circumstances at Newcastle are intriguing now that the owner, Mike Ashley, is being financially circumspect. With an imbalanced squad, the club may be prone to lurches. Middlesbrough, with a youngish group and an emphasis on speed, may be better placed to upgrade their status.</p> <p>Mere survival will ensure exultation for the newcomers: West Bromwich Albion, Stoke City and Hull City. Each of them must study the shrewdness in the market place that, over recent years, has so bolstered Wigan and Bolton. Then again, everyone in the Premier League other than Manchester United is in the scrambling quest for transformation.</p> <h2>Big four: How the new man compares</h2> <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson</strong></p> <p><strong>Stressbuster</strong> More than once a furiously chewed piece of Extra has prevented an apocalyptic meltdown on the Old Trafford touchline.</p> <p><strong>Drinks cabinet</strong> Once owned a pub in Govan, but in the prawn sandwich era has moved on to wine, which he buys and sells for profit.</p> <p><strong>Favourite word</strong> Youse.</p> <p><strong>Bete noir</strong> Pesky bloated footballing supergiants trying to tap up a club's best player.
