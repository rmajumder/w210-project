  "<p>Not so long ago, it was thought that the internet might prove to be the kind of utopian space that Negri hopes to find. Turner's enjoyably deep cultural history traces the roots of 1990s techno-utopianism in the acid tests and communes of the 1960s. He tells the story through the central figure of Stewart Brand, founder in 1968 of the \"Whole Earth Catalog\", which promoted American Indian fashions, self-sufficient living, and cybernetic theory. The last, of course, came straight out of the military-industrial complex that Brand and fellow enthusiasts saw themselves as rebelling against. </p> <p>This and similar tensions are deftly traced as Turner continues the story through the hobbyist computer scene of the 1970s and then Brand's legendary internet bulletin board, the Well, to the electro-optimism of the dotcom boom and Wired magazine, which in 1997 stated on its cover: \"We're facing 25 years of prosperity, freedom and a better environment for the whole world. You got a problem with that?\" It's quite touching in retrospect. Meanwhile, Brand himself becomes a kind of meta-entrepreneur, linking global networks of idealistic businesspeople, what Slavoj Zizek would call \"liberal communists\". They didn't beat the system; they joined it.</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of bathing beaches have been contaminated with increased levels of sewage as the wet summer increases pressure on water treatment systems and forces millions of extra litres of toxic waste to be pumped into the sea.</p> <p>Last month, two-thirds of the 488 designated bathing beaches, rivers and inland waters in England and Wales suffered increases in peak sewage pollution compared with the same period in 2006, the last dry July. Pollution incidents in breach of European commission standards were recorded at almost a third of bathing waters.</p> <p>Worst affected have been some of the country's most popular swimming spots, including Totland Bay on the Isle of Wight, Camber Sands in East Sussex and Watergate Bay in Cornwall, home of Jamie Oliver's Fifteen restaurant and the Extreme Academy, one of Cornwall's most popular surf schools.</p> <p>Campaigners against water pollution said the tests conducted by the Environment Agency last month raised questions about the true cleanliness of beaches in Britain. </p> <p>In the UK, 138 beaches fly the blue flag, which should guarantee that \"no industrial or sewage-related discharges may affect the beach area\". This week the Guardian visited Porthtowan, a blue flag beach in Cornwall where evidence of sewage contamination included used cotton buds and remnants of sanitary towels. Campaigners say that hypodermic needles which have been flushed down the toilet are often found as well.</p> <p>The inability of sewage systems to cope with heavy summer rains could be behind the problem, according to clean water campaigners. Rainfall levels were twice as high in July as in 2006 and this month could go down as the wettest August in a century.</p> <p>\"Some sewage overflow pipes are discharging constantly when they shouldn't be,\" said Thomas Bell, coastal pollution officer for the Marine Conservation Society. \"We know these overflows will be discharging more often now with the rain we have had this summer. The sewage is heavily contaminated effluent and big pieces of debris, which includes sanitary items, plastic and organic waste which is flushed down the toilet.\"</p> <p>Environment Agency figures show that at 310 testing sites, peak levels of coliform bacteria - which are abundant in animal and human faeces - were higher in the first three weeks of July than in the same period of 2006, 135 were lower and 43 remained the same.</p> <p>The problems come as people swap holidays abroad for a trip to the British seaside. An estimated 34m trips are expected to be made this year, 45% more than in 2007. But heavy rains have put pressure on the sewage system, which discharges either raw or partially treated effluent into rivers or out to sea to avoid it backing up into people's homes.</p> <p>Godrevy beach on St Ives Bay in Cornwall has suffered increased pollution, partly because of sewage discharged from sewage overflows into the Red river, which runs on to its sands.</p> <p>\"The treatment works are suffering because of the unseasonal heavy rainfalls we are getting, and because of that they have to dispose of some of the sewage untreated through a combined sewage and storm water overflow,\" said Richard Hardy, campaigns director for Surfers Against Sewage. \"We regularly clean this beach but you can see cotton bud sticks and tampon applicators. We know that surfers and bodyboarders, whose sports result in swallowing seawater, are three times more at risk than the average bather of picking up something like gastroenteritis.\"</p> <p>Local surfers have reported cases of acute vomiting and diarrhoea after ingesting sea water.</p> <p>The water industry has invested \u00a32bn since 1990 to improve bathing water quality, with the result that the proportion of beaches meeting the European bathing water directive increased from 78% to 99% in 2006. However, water quality fell last year and there are fears it could fall again this year to pre-2001 levels.</p> <p>\"As part of water company business plans developed for the water company price review in 2009, the Environment Agency is encouraging continued commitment and investment in maintaining, improving and protecting our water and sewerage infrastructures, which secure a high standard of bathing water quality,\" the EA said in a statement.</p> <p>However raw sewage is still routinely pumped into waters next to four bathing beaches in Cornwall, at Tintagel, Boscastle, Bossiny Haven and Polpeor, as well as beaches in Wales, the Isle of Man and Scotland.</p> <p>This week, sewage created by thousands of holidaymakers at Tintagel could be seen pumping directly into the sea despite the area's designation as an area of outstanding natural beauty. The smell engulfed hikers on the cliff tops and seagulls picked at the cloudy plume. </p> <p>Staithes, in North Yorkshire, the UK's worst bathing beach, is facing being struck off the list of designated bathing beaches because the bacterial contamination which runs from two waterways into the harbour will cost an estimated \u00a314m to clear up. The EA has said that unless the local community can raise funds, a sign will be erected warning bathers off.</p> <p>But there are also signs of progress. Environmental campaigners celebrated a small victory last week when Marks &amp; Spencer, the Co-op and the Body Shop agreed to replace the plastic stems on cotton buds with cardboard. The plastic sticks have become one of the telltale signs of pollution around Britain's shores.</p> <h2>Beach table</h2> <p><strong>Five of the best:</strong></p> <p>St Ives, Cornwall</p> <p>Woolacombe, Devon</p> <p>Lulworth Cove, Dorset</p> <p>Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire</p> <p>Abersoch, Wales</p> <p><strong>Five of the worst:</strong></p> <p>Staithes, North Yorkshire</p> <p>Bude (Summerleaze), Cornwall</p> <p>Cooden Beach, East Sussex</p> <p>East Haven, Angus</p> <p>Ballyholme, Co Down.</p>",
  "<p>Tata Motors will move production of the world's cheapest car from a new factory in India's West Bengal state if violent protests by local farmers forced to sell their land continue, its chairman warned yesterday.</p> <p>In a blow to the country's image as an emerging centre of manufacturing might, Ratan Tata told a press conference that demonstrations over the acquisition of farmland for the factory threatened to delay the launch of the Nano, scheduled for October.</p> <p>\"What has concerned us is the violence, the disruptions, that has led us to be concerned about the safety of our employees, our equipment and investment, and of the viability of the process,\" he said in the state capital, Kolkata, yesterday.</p> <p>\"We need to protect our people. How would we [be able to] bring our managers and their families if they are going to get beaten? ... If anybody is under the impression that, because we have made a large investment of 15bn rupees (\u00a3184m), we would not move, then they are wrong, because we would move to protect our people.\"</p> <p>The Nano, which will be sold for 100,000 rupees (\u00a31,230), was designed to bring motoring to the masses. Although hailed by the world's press this year, the Nano factory has become a symbol of the simmering confrontation between industry and farmers who are unwilling to part with land in a country where two-thirds of the population depends on agriculture.</p> <p>In the case of Tata's new car, more than 1,000 acres of fertile fields in West Bengal's Singur district were acquired by the state government to set up the Nano plant. The factory will be able to produce 250,000 cars a year. Thousands of farmers who once raised four crops a year have been evicted.</p> <p> When the Guardian visited the site this year it found farmers had killed themselves after losing land, and a protestor had discovered the body of his daughter inside the factory site, strangled and burned. </p> <p>The heavy-handed actions have resulted in repeated clashes. This week a strike shut the factory and thousands marched, blocking access to the site. </p> <p><strong>Rebranding</strong></p> <p>The backlash is embarrassing for West Bengal's communist government, which has been in power for more than three decades and saw the Nano project as vital to rebranding itself as a regime friendly to capitalism. </p> <p>Some analysts say Tata may be using the threat to force the state government to face down the protests, something it has been noticeably reluctant to do since losing local elections. </p> <p>Opposition parties demand the return of 400 acres of land, which the company says is impossible.</p> <p>\"Tata say they have no Plan B. The factory is nearly complete and the money is spent in West Bengal. If they start again somewhere else it will take time and there will be a cost implication. However, Nano will be loss-making at this price so Tata may save some money in that way,\" said Mahantesh Sabarad of Mumbai's Centrum Broking.</p> <p>Commentators say that, whatever the calculation, this is a \"huge blow\" for West Bengal, long plagued by labour unrest. </p> <p>\"It's disastrous. The real problem is the way that land was acquired - by government strong-arming people into selling their land,\" said Gurcharan Das, a business columnist. </p> <p>\"I think the real question here is whether Indians want to remain starving peasants or part of an urban proletariat. My bet is the latter.\"</p> <p>Economists say that at the heart of the argument is the fact that land is one of India's scarcest resources, and its acquisition is essential to balancing industrial growth with the needs of rural farmers. </p> <p>The tensions signal an economic transformation that is likely to be as jarring as that in China, which has seen a number of \"peasant revolts\" over land grabbed for new industries. </p> <p>However, some say the Indian system will give rise to a \"negotiated industrialisation\".</p> <p>\"I think we are seeing local people having a say in the process. And sometimes projects are pulled. Just recently 11 dams were cancelled after local protests in Sikkim,\" said Sunita Narain, head of Delhi's Centre for Science and Environment.</p> <p>\"Industrialisation has been violent in other countries, but I think Indian democracy can accommodate it without the violence.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The Tata Nano was hailed as the great hope for the Indian middle classes when it was launched this year. The car, a jelly bean-shaped hatchback with a 623cc engine, was billed as the cheapest in the world. It would prompt millions of Indians to get off their scooters and into cars. </p> <p>The Nano was supposed to roll out of the 1,000-acre site in Singur, West Bengal. However, farmers have stepped up protests in recent weeks, concerned that they had missed out. Land prices in the area have shot up at least fivefold since December 2006, when the government started the land acquisition. Plots are going at 5m rupees (\u00a361,400) an acre. The discontent has been fuelled by social activists, and opposition politicians defending the right of farmers to their land. </p> <p>There is also the issue of jobs. The Tata factory took the land or jobs of at least 14,000 farmers and others. In return, the plant would create only 1,500 jobs.</p>",
  "<p>As I approached Zakynthos on the ferry, the sea had the supple smoothness of shark skin and the late haze of morning was rising up the green flanks of the island, leaving the houses of Zakynthos town bathed in sunlight. Further along the coast, bright daubs of red pantiles could be glimpsed through palm trees and sprays of pink bougainvillea. As we entered the harbour, the passengers crowded to the rails, most of them locals on the way home - priests and widows in black, the rest more colourful. </p> <p>All the familiar ingredients of a perfect Greek morning. Now here are a few extra elements: death threats, beatings, illegal building, rampant corruption and shocking environmental degradation that threatens one of Europe's most endangered species, the loggerhead turtle, in its prime Mediterranean nesting area. None of this is readily visible on arrival, particularly if you are a first-time visitor like myself. I stepped off the ferry and looked around with an approving eye. After a five-day odyssey by train through Europe, I was looking forward to diving into that wine-dark sea, tasting some fish, drinking a few glasses of ouzo.</p> <p>We usually accept places for what they are on first contact. Only when we return years later do we start to grumble, \"It's ruined!\" That morning, Zakynthos looked great. An hour later </p> <p>I was standing on a hillside with Yannis Vardakastanis and I was seeing things differently.</p> <p>Born on the island in 1964, Yannis has packed several incarnations into one life: teenage sailor on freighters to the far east, centre forward for Lincoln City Football Club, and beach-bar proprietor serving up drinks and good humour to the tourists on Zakynthos's Gerakas beach, one of the favourite egg-laying sites of the loggerhead turtle. Then, in 1990, standing at his bar on the sands, looking out over his uncle's loungers to his brother's pedalo operation, across the hundreds of tourists, he had an epiphany.</p> <p>\"That day there were 1,800 people coming to the beach and I realised I was completely wrong,\" he says. \"Such a crowd of people in a turtle nesting area was doing a lot of damage. I decided everyone had to get out, get off the beach.\"</p> <p>Turtle protection is certainly one of environmentalism's toughest assignments, not only because of the conflict with tourist development. In winter the Zakynthos loggerheads migrate to the north African coast, Malta and Sardinia, further complicating the story. By the time a turtle has dodged the many hazards - fishermen's nets, plastic bags, seagulls, tourists' sunloungers - only one in a thousand will make it back to the beach of its birth and breed.</p> <p>The realisation that turtle numbers were falling led Yannis to do the unthinkable: he dismantled his beach bar and moved it on to land above the beach. His family thought he was crazy, but in fact he had become what at the time was another of the island's rare species: an environmental activist. </p> <p>\"When I was a kid,\" he says, \"I'd be alone on the beach and go out swimming with the turtles and dolphins. In summer the beach at Gerakas would be black with hatchlings. I didn't appreciate it at the time, but I was living in God's pocket.\"</p> <p>For the past 18 years Yannis has been working to restore a little bit of that lost paradise. His small group of cottages at Gerakas offers a very different experience to the island's resorts: quiet, simple accommodation in the gardens and olive groves behind the beach. The nightlife, apart from the cicadas, consists of the local builder and his sons, who do a mean set of classic folk songs at the taverna. The main beach at Gerakas is never crowded, but for real seclusion there are a couple of rocky coves where there is room to stretch out a towel or two. I went snorkelling in one of them with my son, Conor, and we found ourselves watching squid moving among shoals of tiny colourful fish. The turtles, however, did not put in an appearance. </p> <p>\"It's the turtles that highlight the problems on the island,\" Yannis says. \"Their nesting sites are the main tourist beaches, and their nesting time is exactly the same as the European holiday season. We have to find a way that humans and animals can co-exist.\"</p> <p>At Gerakas beach, it seems they are finding a way. It has not been easy - Yannis has had to deal with everything from death threats to the anger of members of his own family - but now Gerakas is the best beach on the island. The pedalos have gone, as have the beach bars and food sellers, and only about 120 sunbeds remain. At sunset the beach closes to all except turtle protection workers. Yannis has his own conservation group, Earth Sea and Sky, which works with Archelon, a Greek NGO. Volunteers from the two organisations patrol the island's beaches, counting and marking nests and keeping night-time vigils as the turtles come in to lay their eggs. Those I spoke to were full of enthusiasm and many had been coming for several summers. \"I love the night-time beach patrols, watching the turtles climb up the beach in the moonlight,\" a British volunteer with Archelon told me. He was in his third summer and already planning a fourth. </p> <p>To this first-timer, standing on a hillside looking over the southern side of the island, things seem pretty good. The hillsides look fresh and green, the sea deliciously cool, but then Yannis starts to point out a few things. \"See the tower over there? That's the airport. They built it on top of our only lake, which was a major migration point for thousands of birds, including flamingoes.\" I give myself a pat on the back for not arriving by air. </p> <p>Then he stands up and his accusing finger moves to the left, to the crust of development at the end of the bay. \"That is Laganas, the main tourist town for Zakynthos, very popular with the British. I want to show you Laganas.\" We drive down. The green of the hills gives way to an ugly mess of scrubland and concrete ribbon development, and then we are into Laganas: bars, strip joints, cheap drinks. A pair of shirtless youths roll across the street guffawing drunkenly. The majority of the island's visitors are British - more than 600,000 of them every year. Laganas is where this summer nine British female tourists found themselves charged with prostitution after taking part in an \"oral sex competition\" in one of the bars. Yannis doesn't get out of the car; he cannot bear Laganas. </p> <p>I wander along the packed beach. The sea is full of swimmers and boats. There are glass-bottomed boats huddled together, circling a turtle while everyone gets the essential photo. Most turtle injuries on the island are caused by boat propellers. A girl assails me with an offer of a turtle-watching trip. Her sign says, \"We care for the turtles!\"</p> <p>\"How do you care?\" I ask.</p> <p>She smiles. \"We don't kill them by driving the boat over them.\"</p> <p>\"Until the 1980s Laganas, with the airport just behind it, was a big freshwater ecosystem as well as the main nesting site for loggerhead turtles,\" Yannis says. \"Now the sand is packed so hard that no turtle could ever make a nest, even if it wanted to. All the building here on the beach is illegal. It is just a big club for 18 to 30s, and with all the drunkenness it has become a very dangerous place.</p> <p>\"Gerakas has been a success, but now I want to extend that success - I'm taking the message to the heart of the problem.\" He is building a turtle rescue centre in Laganas to raise awareness of the issue. It is a courageous move, and one that will bring him into possible conflict with powerful vested interests. \"Every year there are injured animals and I think they should be treated here - and then released back into the bay,\" he says.</p> <p>From Laganas we head up to the Archelon camp. Chris Dean, a British biologist, the project's co-ordinator, says: \"We have had local hostility in the past seven years. Some of our people were beaten up and the camp has been targeted.\" He grins. \"But things are getting better now. I reckon our message is getting through.\"</p> <p>Yannis is more cautious. \"Loggerheads take at least 25 years to reach sexual maturity, so we haven't yet felt the full effects of the beach development.\" Those turtles circling off Laganas are not posing for photographs, but are simply disoriented, having returned to their native beach to find it destroyed.</p> <p>Yannis takes me over the hill to see two beaches that are supposed to have full protection, being part of a marine park that was established in 1999. The first shock is to see a landfill tip inside the park boundaries. The guard refuses to allow us close enough to take photographs. \"Apart from pollution problems, the tip attracts seagulls, the main predator of baby turtles, and it is right above Dafni beach, a major nesting area,\" Yannis says. What is most surprising about this rubbish dump, as announced on a noticeboard outside, is that it was 75% funded by a \u20ac1m grant from the EU. </p> <p>Further down the track are more unpleasant surprises. Dafni beach has several illegal buildings, including two tavernas. The Greek government has been committed to clearing the buildings since 1984, but it seems the authorities are big on legislation, but short on action. The road barrier at Dafni, intended to keep cars out, is up and clearly unused. An Archelon volunteer tells me that the beach here is not patrolled by the turtle-watchers because the locals are too hostile.</p> <p>Sekania, the adjoining beach and the most important nesting site on the island, has been made out of bounds to visitors. This, says Dean, is proof that the marine park is starting to fulfil its purpose. \"We've got 185 nests there this season,\" he says.</p> <p>Yannis and the Archelon workers represent a future for Zakynthos in which tourists and turtles each have a place. Back at Gerakas, watching Yannis's father's donkey graze contentedly under the olive trees, it seems to me that it is the cheap glitz of Laganas whose days are numbered.</p> <h2>How you can help</h2> <p><strong>Earth Sea and Sky</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.earthseasky.org\">earthseasky.org</a>), set up by Yannis Vardakastanis, runs volunteer projects and activities throughout the summer.

  "<p>I always thought that amnesia affected only victims of severe head trauma and that you would need years of intense therapy to get back to normal. Yet that isn't what happened to me.</p> <p>On April 30, I went to bed an ordinary 32-year-old mother of one, living in Manchester and studying psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University. </p> <p>The next morning, I woke into a nightmare. I was convinced I was my 15-year-old self. Distressed and confused, I wondered why I wasn't in my comfy lower bunk bed, covered in a pink Marilyn Monroe bedspread, sharing a room with my sister. As far as I was concerned, it was 1992 - GCSEs, Inspiral Carpets, Stone Roses and illegal raves. </p> <p>Yet here I was in a two-bedroom council house with a room full of books, a cat and an 11-year-old son I didn't recognise. In those first hours, I paced my bedroom convinced I was going mad. I can remember looking in the bathroom mirror and starting to scream. Through the eyes of a 15-year-old, what I saw was horrifying; who was this ageing woman with crow's-feet, spots and bags under her eyes? </p> <p>I ran to the telephone, a number going over and over in my head, even though I had no idea whose it was. I called and it was Kerry, a close friend who lives nearby.</p> <p>Kerry and my sister came round and looked after me. For the first day or two we were all hoping that I'd go to bed and wake up as if nothing had happened. But if anything, it got worse. As the weekend passed, I grew more shocked and petrified; I didn't understand the outside world, what I was reading and seeing around me.</p> <p>The only Bush I'd heard of was George senior and the Gulf war. My sister painstakingly had to explain the horrors of 9/11, and 7/7.</p> <p>I'd fallen asleep dreaming of a world full of endless possibilities and woken up into a world I could never have envisioned as a teenager: email, Big Brother, Facebook - I had no concept of 21st-century culture and technology. At night, I would start to worry about brain tumours. I would fall asleep longing for the only life I knew: school, best friends, sneaky cigarettes and cider in the park with the bad boys. </p> <p>A few days after the initial memory loss, I went to my doctor. He told me I had transient global amnesia, brought on by a combination of events. Just before I lost my memory, I was extremely stressed. I was anxious about my third-year exams. I had also just split up with a boyfriend, and I'd had a nasty stomach virus followed by tonsillitis. I felt physically and emotionally overwhelmed. The doctor explained that my body could no longer handle the strain, so my brain had closed down its \"episodic\" part, which is linked to emotional memories, times and events. </p> <p>The semantic part of my memory, relating to knowledge rather than specific experiences, was still intact. So even though I didn't recognise my son and had no memory of being pregnant or giving birth, I could remember my pin number and knew how to drive. </p> <p>It can take anything from four weeks to eight months for episodic memory to return. For me, it took six to seven weeks - now I can remember almost everything. I was blessed with a great doctor who early on allayed most of my fears. He told me that many people around the world had suffered a similar type of amnesia, even though it wasn't one that was widely known about. The best cure was to rest and give my body time to repair itself - and not force myself to remember too much. Salvation came in the form of talking each week to my doctor about what I was going through. </p> <p>Fortunately, I had kept 20 years of diaries - at first it was like reading a stranger's journal. Gradually all the pieces began to fit together. Flashes, rather than whole memories, would return and with them the emotional connections I felt at the time. I would hear a song and ask my sister, \"That's to do with your graduation - why?\" She'd reply, \"Yes, we went out that night and danced to it, and had such a laugh. Do you remember?\" Incredibly, I did. </p> <p>As scary as it was, I don't regret anything that happened. I feel privileged to have seen the world through different eyes. It helped me to re-evaluate and put my life back together in a different, but definitely better, way.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Do you have an experience to share?

  "<p>A little before dawn on a recent summer morning, a convoy of three large blue lorries, a handful of police cars and a bus rumbled along the dual carriageway heading north out of the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. Even if it had not been so early, the motorcade would probably not have drawn much attention. The lorries were unmarked, the bus carrying a few sleepy policemen was old and scruffy, while the lumbering shipment was big and slow enough to explain the escort and its flashing blue lights.</p> <p>But for Bulgaria, and indirectly for the rest of us, the convoy's progress marked an important transition - the departure of the country's last remaining stockpile of High Enriched Uranium (HEU), the stuff of which nuclear bombs are made. It took two years of talks and preparatory work before the highly radioactive material - just over 6kg of spent fuel from a defunct research reactor - was fished out of the storage pools in which it had lain unused and largely forgotten for nearly 20 years. It was sealed in steel casks - custom-made by ...koda, the Czech car manufacturer - and lowered into the three anonymous blue trucks.</p> <p>Over the course of the morning of July 5, the convoy made its way over the mountains and down to the banks of the river Danube, where the containers were winched into a long, black barge bound for Ukraine. Ten days and a rail journey later, the HEU arrived in Russia, whence it had come nearly half a century earlier as a gift. In Chelyabinsk, just east of the Urals, it is to be reprocessed or blended down. I was permitted to witness its secret journey on condition that nothing was printed until the shipment reached its destination, and this small but massively lethal fragment of the cold war was made safe.</p> <p>The operation was the latest in a series - part of an accelerating scramble to clean up the scattered legacy of nuclear profligacy. In the 50s and 60s, the US and Soviet Union exported HEU-powered nuclear reactors to their allies for power generation and experimentation. When the cold war finally came to an end, deals were done on dismantling the redundant weapons in the former Soviet republics. Under a programme called Megatons To Megawatts, one tenth of America's electricity is generated from uranium from thousands of former Soviet warheads. The Russians blend down HEU in the warheads to Low Enriched Uranium (LEU), which cannot be used in bombs; the Americans transport it to nuclear power stations back home.</p> <p>However, that still left thousands of kilograms of weapons-grade material, mostly HEU, in civilian reactors at power stations and universities around the world, some with no more security than a watchman and a padlock.</p> <p>As the logic of deterrence and mutually assured destruction recedes from the collective memory to be supplanted by the fears evoked by the September 11 attacks, nuclear terrorism has emerged as the number one threat to western security. The suicidal extremist driving a crude nuclear device into the centre of a major city is now the ultimate nightmare. George Bush and Tony Blair went to war in Iraq with the ostensible aim of preventing Saddam's assumed nuclear stockpile falling into the hands of al-Qaida jihadists. Barack Obama has called nuclear terrorism \"the greatest danger we face\".</p> <p>The gap between rhetoric and effective action, however, is startling. The US has so far spent $648bn on the war in Iraq to eliminate a threat that never existed. The amount spent on removing fissile material from countries that actually do have the ingredients for a nuclear device has been paltry by comparison. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI), launched in 2004 after previous efforts at eliminating the world's civilian stocks of fissile material had proved ineffectual, has an annual US budget of about $150m, or roughly what the US military spends in eight hours in Iraq. Britain allocates a respectable \u00a336.5m a year to the programme, most of it on helping to secure nuclear sites in the former Soviet Union, but that still pales in comparison to the \u00a31.7bn cost last year of keeping troops in Iraq.</p> <p>There is no question that the threat of nuclear terrorism is real. As long ago as 1998, Osama bin Laden declared it was a religious duty to acquire nuclear weapons \"to terrorise the enemies of God\". Just days before the September 11 attacks in 2001, the al-Qaida leader met a Pakistani delegation, including two retired nuclear scientists, in Kandahar. According to accounts of that meeting, Bin Laden expressed keen interest in how to build a bomb and was told it was technically quite simple - acquiring the fissile material was the main obstacle.</p> <p>Al-Qaida has spent years trying to overcome that problem. Western intelligence officials believe the organisation was cheated several times by middlemen claiming to have weapons-grade material for sale. An al-Qaida defector, Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl, has described helping Bin Laden clinch a deal in Sudan, his home country: Bin Laden paid $1.5m for a 30-inch cylinder supposedly containing South African uranium. The cylinder is widely believed to have been a fake.</p> <p>Ivan Ivanov, a Bulgarian businessman working for a Dubai-based building contractor, claims to have met Bin Laden in Pakistan in April 2001, and to have been approached the day after the meeting by an al-Qaida scientist who proposed a scheme for buying Bulgarian nuclear material. Ivanov says he turned down the deal, but Bulgaria has remained a source of concern for anyone worried about proliferation. The country's post-Soviet nuclear industry has been hit by one safety scandal after another, and the EU has taken the unusual step of cutting off funds because of the hold that corruption and organised crime have on the country's economy.</p> <p>The removal of Bulgaria's HEU last month was therefore more than a technicality. It represented the elimination of a significant threat. Officials at Sofia's Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy, where the spent fuel had been stored since its reactor was shut down in 1989, claimed security had been beefed up in recent years, but the Institute was clearly suffering from years of neglect. Feral dogs chased each other through the bushes in the grounds around the reactor.</p> <p>The removal operation was overseen by a two-man American team, who represent the business end of the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. Their job is to fly around the world trying to persuade governments that it is in their long-term interests to part with their stocks of fissile material.</p> <p>The US duo are both immigrants. Andrew Bieniawski, a 41-year-old from South Africa, is in charge of the programme at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the part of the US department of energy that is responsible for looking after the US nuclear arsenal, making sure the bombs still work and do not blow up unexpectedly. His deputy, Igor Bolshinsky, a former mine technician from the Ukrainian coal city of Donetsk, has responsibility for repatriating the Soviet-origin material and does most of the travelling and persuading - \"Schmoozing for world peace,\" as Bolshinsky put it.</p> <p>\"This is what keeps us on the road 70% of the time,\" he said. \"We see different reactors in different conditions, and we know this removal has to be done very fast. We don't want to give more time to people who are preparing to steal this material.\"</p> <p>In Sofia, Bolshinsky had been in fine form, cajoling, joking and flattering Bulgarian officials in a mix of Russian and English. He was consequently stunned on the designated day of the uranium's departure when Bulgarian security - somewhat prickly over the arrival of this ebullient American employee in the nation's inner nuclear sanctum - ordered the uranium convoy to leave the institute an hour earlier than agreed, without bothering to tell Bolshinsky. </p> <p>In the past few years, Bolshinsky has overseen uranium removals from Libya to Vietnam, and has been tailed in the course of his duties by some of the world's most persistent secret policemen, but this stunt stretched his sense of humour to breaking point. \"Not good, not good at all,\" he said emphatically when he turned up at the reactor at dawn to find the car park empty. He jumped into a car for a high-speed chase along a Bulgarian motorway, in pursuit of the missing uranium casks.</p> <p>He finally caught up with the convoy about 32km north of Sofia, parked on the hard shoulder of the motorway. Ivan Gorinov, the head of \"physical protection\" at Bulgaria's Nuclear Regulatory Agency who appeared to have taken the decision to leave early, was unapologetic. \"I don't care about the American taxpayer,\" Gorinov said defiantly, and a touch sulkily, when he was reminded that the exercise had been US-funded. Nor did he hide his lack of enthusiasm for the presence of journalists, suggesting that we might prefer to see a wet T-shirt competition underway in the nearby town of Kozloduy than observe the casks being loaded on to the giant barge.</p> <p>Gorinov said later he would have been less nervous if the HEU shipment had gone by rail, but the necessary transit agreements would have taken too long to negotiate. It had been decided to take the quicker but riskier option of moving the uranium casks about 180km to the Danube by road, where it was theoretically vulnerable to ambush or protests.</p> <p>\"That was a big challenge, from the security point of view, and from the point of view of keeping it secret,\" Gorinov said, \"but we had a constant exchange of information with the Bulgarian security services.\" A chain-smoker, he began to relax only when technicians in white coats and caps lowered the blue containers into the belly of the 86m barge and slid its long lid over them. \"It looks just like any other barge - business as usual on the Danube,\" he declared triumphantly.</p> <p>As the barge moved off downstream, heading towards Ukraine and a rendezvous with a Russian train, Bulgaria became officially free of HEU.</p> <p>There are two kinds of nuclear bomb. Modern warheads involve an implosion device, in which the fissile material, normally plutonium, is violently compressed by shaped charges until it reaches critical mass, and the process of nuclear fission becomes self-sustaining. This is an extremely hard trick to pull off reliably, and is the province of sophisticated state programmes. However, there is a much cruder form of bomb, which achieves critical mass by firing one chunk of HEU at another. A \"gun-type\" bomb such as this, Little Boy, was dropped on Hiroshima. As the apartheid government in South Africa discovered, it can be developed by a relatively small team with some basic engineering skills. It is the sort of bomb a terrorist organisation would build. Plutonium is useless for such a device. It requires HEU, which happens to be far more plentiful and much less well guarded.</p> <p>Under the GTRI, a total of 610kg of HEU fuel (both spent and fresh) has now been returned to Russia from countries including Serbia, Romania, Libya, Uzbekistan, Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Latvia and Vietnam. More than a third of those shipments took place in 2007, as the urgency underlying the programme has increased. US-made HEU has meanwhile been repatriated from Latin America, Europe and south-east Asia. In fact, at about the same time the uranium convoy was leaving Sofia, secret shipments of HEU and plutonium were on the way to the US from Japan, Sweden, Germany and Denmark. More than 50 HEU reactors around the world have been converted to use LEU. Four reactors have been closed down altogether.</p> <p>Hungary and Kazakhstan are next on Bieniawski and Bolshinsky's visiting list, after which virtually all the fresh HEU fuel being stored at civilian sites around the world will have been dealt with. And almost all the Soviet-origin spent HEU, which can still contain high concentrations of weapons-grade material, is due to be removed from civilian sites around the world by 2010. Bieniawski said every day counts. \"We are very concerned about this material. We take this threat to be very real. The information that we have lets us know we have to act as aggressively as possible to remove this material,\" he said.</p> <p>The programme does not include military stockpiles, which are usually better guarded and are part of a different scheme, nor does it cover \"gap\" HEU fuel, made in neither the US nor the Soviet Union, but in countries such as South Africa that ran their own nuclear programmes. Ukraine and Belarus are also reluctant to give up all their HEU.</p> <p>There is another, even more troubling, question hanging over Bieniawski and Bolshinsky's work: could their efforts already be too late? They are, in effect, running a race blindfold. They do not know if their adversaries - the terrorist groups, smugglers and bent officials with whom they work - are behind them, breathing down their necks, or ahead of them, or even whether they have already crossed the finishing line. What is beyond doubt is that they are in the race - and their footprints are all around.</p> <p>Since the end of the cold war, the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has logged more than 800 incidents in which radioactive material has gone missing or been seized from smugglers. Eighteen of those cases involved weapons-grade material, HEU or plutonium, mostly of Soviet origin. Another seven cases of weapons-grade theft or contraband have yet to be confirmed by the IAEA, but are considered well-founded.</p> <p>In a recent example, a Russian fish trader and occasional smuggler named Oleg Khinsagov was arrested in Georgia in early 2006. He had about 100g of weapons-grade HEU in his leather jacket, wrapped in a plastic bag, and was under the impression he was about to sell his sample to a Muslim from a \"serious organisation\" on the market for fissile material. Khinsagov told his customer there were two more kilograms available. The would-be buyer turned out to be a Georgian government agent, and Khinsagov is now sitting in prison in Tbilisi, apparently too terrified of his Russian contacts to name them.</p> <p>At a time when long-standing Russian-Georgian tensions have exploded into conflict, Moscow has been unhelpful in the extreme, implausibly claiming that it is impossible to tell where Khinsagov's HEU came from. Coincidentally or not, an estimated 2kg of HEU went missing when a top-secret former Soviet nuclear laboratory in the Georgian region of Abkhazia fell to Russian-backed separatists in 1993. It simply disappeared into the chaotic underworld of the Caucasus where organised crime thrives on national rivalries, and has not been seen since.</p> <p>Last November, on the other side of the world, two groups of armed men broke into the emergency control centre at South Africa's supposedly high-security Pelindaba nuclear facility, where hundreds of kilograms of HEU are stored - they stumbled on a senior security official who was not supposed to have been there but was keeping his girlfriend company. The intruders shot him and fled. </p> <p>In formal testimony to the IAEA, the South African government admitted the attackers were \"technically sophisticated\" and had \"prior knowledge of the electronic security systems\". On the other hand, they insisted the site's fissile material had not been in danger and that only a computer had been taken. There have been no arrests so far.</p> <p>Most of the nuclear thefts located by the IAEA to date have involved small quantities of HEU, far short of the 55kg necessary to build a gun-type bomb, but no one knows how much more has disappeared unnoticed. Matthew Bunn, a proliferation expert at Harvard, has estimated the risk of a nuclear attack on the US in the next decade to be 29%. He was once asked by an investment bank to carry out a similar exercise for London. He will not say what he told the bank, revealing only that he estimated a smaller risk than his US estimate, but still \"a real number\".</p> <p>James Acton, a nuclear proliferation expert at King's College London, said, \"Even if you think that there is a one per cent, or half per cent, chance of there being such a catastrophic event, it's probably worth taking a lot more precautions than we are at the moment.\"</p> <p>A terrorist group could make do with much less than the 55kg of HEU necessary to achieve critical mass and detonate whatever it had managed to steal or buy on the black market in the form of a \"dirty bomb\". Acton said radioactive material could also be sprayed like an aerosol across a wide urban expanse, in a stealth attack that could pass unnoticed until it was too late.</p> <p>\"If people insist on the same standards [for radioactivity] we have now, we would have to give up large areas of the city. People would ultimately have to get used to the risk of going back to a slightly contaminated part of London,\" Acton said. It would be so easy to perform and so devastating in its effects, he added: \"I really don't know why an attack hasn't happened already.\" </p> <p>Dhiren Barot, a north London al-Qaida member arrested in 2004 on terrorism charges, had been planning a dirty bomb attack using tiny radioactive particles found in home smoke alarms, which he intended to buy by the thousand. Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, has said the government is taking the threat seriously and a computer simulation of a radiological attack on London was carried out by the Home Office last year. Senior officials in the Bush administration took part in a similar exercise last year, involving three simultaneous dirty bomb blasts, and Spain, another recent terrorist target, carried out a drill earlier this year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, radiation detectors are being installed in ports around the world, as a last line of defence against a smuggled nuclear device. So far they have produced literally millions of false alarms (a particular potassium isotope in bananas, for example, can set off the sirens). The White House has its own nuclear bomb squad, which it scrambled in 2005 to intercept US-bound ships suspected of carrying a weapon. It turned out they were carrying scrap metal contaminated by illegally dumped radioactive material.</p> <p>This is the emerging battlefield of the 21st century. Western governments have little idea whether they are being overly paranoid or recklessly negligent in their preparations. The potential is so horrifying, there seems little choice but to prepare for the worst.</p>",
  "<p>You could get fined for taking your daughter out of school without permission from the head (which, presumably, would be difficult to obtain during the holidays). Your daughter will miss the first few days settling in to a new class and a new school year. Could you have a summer holiday at home during the school holidays instead? Camp out in the garden, be tourists in your own town ... children don't need to be taken to exotic places to have adventures, and you could find it just as restful holidaying at home without needing to disrupt your daughter's education.<br><strong>Liz Plane,</strong> Luton,</p> <p>If your daughter does miss some school time, she would probably catch up with the work and continue with the same friends, but the subliminal message from you is that education/school is not really that important compared with holidays. The argument that travel is educational was shattered by a pupil of mine who had been to Spain in term time. When I asked about the countryside, she said that she had not been out of the hotel complex!<br><strong>B Hillmen </strong>(retired teacher), by email</p> <p>It's quite clear from your letter that you can afford a holiday, but not the one to which you somehow feel entitled. Taking your daughter out of school in this way is profoundly selfish. It damages her education and gives her the message that she can take it or leave it if something \"better\" comes up. It also harms the progress of the rest of her class, as the teacher will have to take time to help her catch up on her return. Have you never heard of Kant's moral imperative? - ie, how would it be if everyone did as you propose and dipped in and out of the term as they felt fit?<br><strong>Gillian Williamson, </strong>Saffron Walden, Essex</p> <p>I once had a week out at the start of a school year. Decades later, I can remember wandering round the school friendless until a new girl arrived. Even now, it's not too late to pack the car and B&amp;B somewhere new and exciting each weekend in September. Everyone lives within 100 miles of really interesting stuff; buy the book Bollocks to Alton Towers and use it as a guide.<br><strong>Margaret Squires, </strong>St Andrews, Fife</p> <p>Without getting into the legalities of the situation, schools should realise that children can learn many things outside of the classroom environment and holidays can be an excellent way of achieving this. I would, however, consider your choice of destination before committing to take your beloved out of school. If you're planning two weeks on the beach in Ibiza, all you're teaching her is how people behave while under the influence of 18 pints of larger, kebab eating and the use of buildings as a toilet. However, if you're planning a cultural and educational trip to any number of wonderful places, then let the head teacher know that your daughter will be returning to school late and will prepare a project on what she has discovered while on her educational break.<br><strong>Andrew Jarvis,</strong><strong> </strong>Newcastle</p> <p>Think of the impact that missing the first week of a new school year will have on your daughter. This is a time for making new friends and establishing herself within the new class. She'll have a new teacher, probably, and then there's the new class rules and procedures. Then there are the simple things, like which coat peg she gets or where she sits in the dinner hall, which can be so important to a small child. I don't know how socially interactive your child is or how successful academically, but when all children are starting a new year they are nervous, and she'll probably feel even more nervous walking into the playground a week late. The older the child, maybe the less the impact. No time is a good time to take your child out of school because the curriculum moves on relentlessly. You may argue that a holiday can be just as educational as a week in school, and everyone understands that the cost of fares rise dramatically as soon as the school holidays start. However, I would urge you to rethink this holiday and discuss your circumstances with the headteacher well in advance next time, and remember - always be honest.<br><strong>Julia Cariss, </strong>Ffrith, Flintshire</p> <p>For more ideas go to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money\">www.theguardian.com/money</a> then click on Blogs and Personal Effects </p> <h2>Any answers?</h2> <p>My neighbours and I are considering selling their car (old) and sharing mine (two years old with low mileage).

  "<p>I'm not going to lie to you. You're big enough boys and girls to deal with this now: Wellard from EastEnders has been put down. Wellard is dead. He hasn't gone to live with a lovely couple in Braintree with acres of land for him to bury juicy bones. No, the truth is that Wellard got sick, then he got sicker, then things got very bleak indeed, and then a kindly vet came round to Bianca's house and administered an injection to the fluffy exhausted soul.</p> <p>Wellard slipped away quietly, to a backing track of Stay by East 17, surrounded by Bianca and her legion of children, all sobbing and hugging their four-legged friend. Obviously, I was an emotional mess, but then I'm an animal lover, one of those people condemned to spend old age crawling round building sites at midnight armed with a butterfly net and ASDA Whoops! section prawns, rescuing disgruntled cats with whiskers only marginally less bristly than my own. I was bound to be upset by Wellard's passing. He's been trotting about, begging for scraps and making occasional amuse bouches of Ian Beale's buttocks for 14 years.</p> <p>Wellard was one of the true old guard of EastEnders, unlike, say, Roxy and Ronnie Mitchell, cluttering up every episode of late playing hide and seek with each other around the Square. \"Oh, here you are, I've been looking for you!\" Ronnie says most episodes, \"We need to talk! You've got to come back to the flat!\" \"No, I won't, Ronnie,\" says Roxy, \"I'm moving... moving away!\" \"But you can't move away!\" cries Ronnie, \"Why don't you come back to the flat and I'll move away... to Ibiza!\" \"Oh fine, go to Ibiza then!\" yells Roxy. \"But don't come crying when I'm not here in the flat when you get back! Cos I'm moving away!\" \"Oh, why don't you both bloody move away,\" the nation shouts, fast-forwarding their Sky+ to the dog euthanasia plot.</p> <p>Ronnie and Roxy's latest brouhaha is over Peggy Mitchell's wedding. Yes, Peggy is marrying again. Due to the credit crunch, Peggy has seen a downturn in other people's weddings available for her to stick her beak into, force dismal Queen Vic receptions upon and generally scupper with her Tannoy gob. However, now Peggy can organise her own big day; she's marrying Roxy and Ronnie's dad, Archie Mitchell! </p> <p>Yes, indeed, that's a Mitchell marrying another Mitchell, while a plethora of other Mitchells argue about it, before telling themselves that \"at the end of the day, we're all Mitchells and us Mitchells need to stick together\", etc. Peggy and Archie aren't blood relatives, Peggy being the widow of Archie's brother, but, let's face it, she's still been auntie to his daughters for 30 years, so it's not surprising it's giving queasy Ronnie the dry boke just thinking about her new mommy. She probably senses it can't be long before cousin Phil is due another wifelet.</p> <p>Over in Coronation Street, Tyrone Dobbs's wedding to Molly Compton draws nearer, aided by Molly's Aunty Pam, a bizarre woman who's life's mission is to spread E coli and listeria through Weatherfield via the sale of knock-off pork products kept in the sweaty lining of a beige Littlewoods handbag. \"Wipe the best of the fluff off it, make yourself a nice sandwich, make sure you eat round the green parts, it'll be reet,\" seems to be the general theme of Pam's idea of food hygiene.</p> <p>Recently Pam has started a small business making pickle, allowing her to mask all kinds of terribleness in an opaque sauce and sell it to the locals for \u00a33 a jar. It's been selling like hot cakes. </p> <p>Dev would be frightened for his business if he wasn't clearly so heavily medicated. \"Mmmm, a cup of tea! I like tea. A nice cuppa!\" said Dev this week dreamily, nursing a plate of Jammie Dodgers and a mug of PG Tips. \"Some people like coffee, but it's a cuppa for me. Mmmm...\" Dev is being pursued by the lusty wife of a business partner at the moment who keeps offering to help with his \"interior design\", which she says while undulating her spine and winking like a pirate. What Dev really needs to shake him from his daze is a strong-minded woman, which is fortunate as Tyrone's mother - played by the legendary Margi Clarke - returns at the end of August to shake the cobbles up a bit. I can't wait to see all the different shapes Deirdre's face contorts into when she finds out about that.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Fiz appears to be patching things up with unfaithful ex-boyfriend John Stape, while former teacher John's face has only just recovered from the violent drubbing it took last Christmas Day for sleeping with his A-level pupil Rosie Webster. John is no longer a teacher (something to do with his penis and a lack of discipline over it). He now works at Street Cars, where he's launching a bid to regain Fiz's heart by luring her to the Rovers for romantic pints of Newton &amp; Ridley and packets of Nobby's Nuts. Meanwhile, Rosie, her dad Kevin and the entire staff of Underworld knicker-stitchers channel a death of 1,000 paper cuts on his filthy soul. Fiz still loves him, though, that's the problem. She just does. </p> <p>Just like Deirdre loves Ken, in fact, despite the terrible month he's put her through in his bid to become a novelist. There's been no blissful solitude in a back bedroom hunched over a hot laptop for Ken. Oh no: Ken wanted everyone to enjoy the pain of his art, sat brooding in the dining room, week after week, guzzling Scotch, face covered in stubble, surrounded by crumpled A4, most days neglecting to take Eccles for his afternoon pee.</p> <p>\"He's really caught up in this chapter!\" chirped Deirdre, smiling to hide the tears. \"He looks like a wino,\" said Blanche, quite reasonably. To be honest, most things Blanche says are utterly reasonable. I'd watch an entire episode a week just of Blanche slagging people off. She's shocking but rarely ever wrong.</p> <p>Over in Hollyoaks, baby Max has suffered another confusing week, being passed between his surrogate mum, Tina, who now wants to keep him, and Jacqui, the girl who believes she's his mum, then on to Tony, the boy who thinks he's Max's father (although it might actually be Russ), and then on to Dom, who wants his girlfriend Tina to keep her baby but swears he'll never be as good a father as Tony, who did, after all, donate the sperm. At last glance, Tina was keeping the baby on account of her being the only one with breast milk to feed the poor thing. Kids' TV confuses me these days. Bring back Willo The Wisp.

  "<p>Seventy years ago, Europe was plunged into the deepest crisis experienced since the end of the first world war, paving the way for the rapid descent into a new, even more terrible, world conflict. Few historical developments have been more extensively researched and reassessed than the critical events of 1938, and there have been fierce debates, in particular, about Hitler's aims. Did he have a clear ideological programme, a blueprint consistently followed? Or was he a brutal, unprincipled opportunist, with a gift for propaganda and lust for power, together with a sharp eye for exploiting the weakness of the western democracies? Could German aggression be attributed simply to Hitler's megalomania, or did it represent more deep-seated forces in society, particularly the strength of the military and of big business? Did Hitler, in other words, follow or break with traditional aims in German foreign policy?</p> <p>Historians have wrestled with these questions over the years. But they have gradually arrived at some clear answers. We are currently enjoying a rush of major books about the Third Reich by British historians, and these books are noteworthy not least because they reflect the fact that there are now generally - if not universally - accepted conclusions about Hitler and the run-up to war.</p> <p>An obvious starting point in the debate is the publication in 1961 of AJP Taylor's Origins of the Second World War, which set out to be controversial. For Taylor, Hitler was no more than an opportunist, operating without any plan or programme other than vague notions of expansion. Taylor's real villains were the appeasers in Britain and France whose political ineptitude opened the door. It was a maverick interpretation, which was heatedly contested. Hugh Trevor-Roper convincingly argued that Hitler was a man of ideas, however repulsive. Tim Mason, emphasising the economic pressures arising from German expansionism that made a drive to war inevitable, came close to claiming Taylor did not know what he was talking about. In Germany, Taylor's interpretation was scarcely taken seriously, but the antithesis of his approach was at its most forthright in a work that still forms the most fundamental assessment of prewar German foreign policy, Gerhard L Weinberg's masterly The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany, in which Hitler's goal of domination is absolutely central.</p> <p>Recently, Adam Tooze's acclaimed study The Wages of Destruction (Penguin, 2006) has offered a novel approach - looking at Germany's long-term economic weakness in relation to the US as the key to German aggression. As a determinant of prewar foreign policy Tooze perhaps overemphasises Hitler's preoccupation with the threat from America. But he successfully adds increasing economic pressures on the Nazi regime to the ideological thrust that produced those pressures. And he is also one of the few historians to link the radicalisation of antisemitism to the growing proximity of war, as increased international tension underpinned notions of a \"world Jewish conspiracy\" behind US policy.</p> <p>Jonathan Wright has produced the incisive Germany and the Origins of the Second World War (Palgrave, 2007), while German foreign policy is also explored, as part of the structure of the Nazi regime, in Richard J Evans's The Third Reich in Power (Penguin, 2005) and, with particular focus on Hitler's role, in my own biography of the German leader.</p> <p>So what are the generally accepted conclusions? Hitler had no plainly defined programme. But to dismiss him as merely an opportunist would be wrong. He did have a limited but inflexible framework of ideas that gave consistent direction to his leadership. Its twin tracks, embedded in a sense of race as the key determinant in history, were \"removal\" of the Jews and expansion to the east to obtain land to secure Germany's future. Both imprecise, distant goals served, once Hitler had taken power in January 1933, as guidelines for action for every facet of the regime, without ever having to be spelt out in overt policy terms. Much was adapted to rapidly changing circumstances - but within the parameters embodied by Hitler's ideological \"vision\". </p> <p>Before 1938 there was no incompatibility between Hitler's long-term goals and the interests of the military (and other sections of the power elite) in the build-up of German armed force, renewed national strength and standing, and the profits to be made from an expanding armaments industry. But, as would become ever more apparent from 1938 onwards, Hitler was not just following traditional lines of German policy. Taylor's characteristic throwaway line that \"in international affairs there was nothing wrong with Hitler except that he was a German\" (leaving aside the fact that he was actually Austrian) is misleading. Hitler could indeed build on expansionist traditions in the German power elite. But his increasingly unassailable leadership position and his racial obsessions distorted those traditions, then took policy into uncharted territory as the war progressed - producing ultimately the moral and physical ruination of his country.</p> <p>If even in retrospect it hasn't been easy to arrive at a clear assessment of Hitler's aims, it is little wonder that contemporaries inside and outside Germany were unsure how to deal with him. The year 1938 marked the high-tide of the attempts of the western democracies to appease Hitler. \"Munich\" is still a byword for the ignominy that attaches to Chamberlain's attempts to buy off Hitler at the expense of Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain's reputation cannot be rescued. But recognition of the grave errors of judgment of policy-making in the 1930s has come to be seen in the perspective of the realistic options open to the British government at the time.</p> <p>The first crisis of 1938, over Austria, arose so suddenly that the Nazi leadership was itself caught unawares. It was triggered by the announcement on March 9 by the Austrian chancellor, Kurt von Schuschnigg, that there would be a plebiscite three days later to determine whether Austria would remain an independent country. The result would have been a foregone conclusion, but the plebiscite never took place. Incensed by Schuschnigg's move, Hitler reacted swiftly. On March 11 the Austrians were bullied into submission, Schuschnigg and the president, Wilhelm Miklas, forced to resign. Lord Halifax, the British foreign secretary, had told Schuschnigg that \"his majesty's government are unable to guarantee protection\".</p> <p>Hitler's axis partner, Italy, offered support for the annexation, prompting effusive expressions of Hitler's gratitude. Hitler's man, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, was installed as the new chancellor. But even with Austria under Nazi control, Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht to cross the Austrian border. He himself followed later that day, March 12, making slow progress through the jubilant crowds of Austrians before reaching his home town of Linz. Under the emotional impact of his tumultuous reception, Hitler decided that mere satellite status for Austria was not enough. It had to be full incorporation. Legislation for this was hurriedly devised on March 13. Before the evening was out, Austria was merely a German province. A month later, on April 12, in the perfect result for a plebiscite staged by a dictatorial regime, 99% approved the Anschluss.</p> <p>Though the Anschluss crisis had erupted rapidly and the Nazis had largely made brutal policy on the hoof, it would be mistaken to share Taylor's view that the way in which Austria had fallen under German control had been for Hitler \"a tiresome accident, an interruption of his long-term policy\". It was in fact a direct outcome of the interlinked ideological, military-strategic and economic strands of Nazi policy that had developed over the previous five years. The ideological imperative of expansion, necessitating rapid rearmament, which ensured Hitler's backing in the military leadership and big business, made Austria a strategic target - even apart from Hitler's wish to unite his homeland with the Reich and the growing clamour for union among Austrian Nazi supporters (about a third of the population). The speed of rearmament had led to severe economic bottlenecks. Austria offered much-needed iron-ore deposits, other raw materials and supplies of labour. </p> <p>It was little wonder that there was growing pressure for political union between Germany and Austria, which was already heavily dependent economically on the Reich. In the second half of 1937, Hitler spoke menacingly about moving soon against Austria. And when, on February 12 1938, Hitler met Schuschnigg, he browbeat him into major concessions on German influence there. The plans for a gradual absorption of Austria by Germany were then thrown overboard by Schuschnigg's peremptory announcement of the plebiscite. The crisis followed. But it was a crisis waiting to happen. It was indeed directly provoked by Schuschnigg, rather than Hitler, as Taylor stated, but only in the sense that an unlocked car might provoke someone to steal it. Hitler's furious reaction at Schuschnigg's move should not be taken as evidence that the crisis was unwelcome to the German dictator. On the contrary: it was an opportunity he was avid to grasp with both hands.</p> <p>Hitler knew his action would be swallowed by the western powers. Halifax had implied as much when he had met Hitler the previous November. Chamberlain certainly did not like the brutal methods used. But, speaking to the cabinet's foreign policy committee two days after the Anschluss, he said \"he did not think anything that had happened should cause the government to alter their present policy\" of seeking a general settlement of Europe's problems through the appeasement of Germany. He was, in fact, even more sure that this policy was correct. Appeasement was about to be subjected to a much sterner test in the Czech crisis that was widely expected to follow Hitler's triumph in Austria.</p> <p>The German takeover in Austria left Czechoslovakia completely exposed. And it was even more important than Austria as far as German expansionist aims were concerned. But German aggression was fraught with danger. Since France was treaty-bound to back Czechoslovakia in the event of aggression, and Britain was allied with France, a German attack ran the high risk of European war. The Soviet Union, too, had treaty obligations with the Czechs and had indicated its willingness to help the French. </p> <p>For Hitler, however, there could be no holding back. Precisely because of the alliances between Germany's enemies east and west there was no time to lose in destroying Czechoslovakia if his expansionist intentions were to be realised. Economically, too, the country was a tempting prospect, with its strong industrial base, big armaments factories and important sources of raw materials. The 3 million-strong ethnic German minority in the Sudetenland, abutting Germany, offered the pretext for an allegedly nationalist policy publicly targeted at bringing them \"home to the Reich\". Across the summer of 1938 Hitler ratcheted up pressure on the Czechs. War appeared increasingly likely. But most Germans were horrified at the prospect of another conflict only 20 years after the end of the first world war. Internal reports spoke of a \"war psychosis\" in the German population. The army was divided. The chief of the general staff, Ludwig Beck, advocated a collective stand by the military leadership, but was left isolated and he resigned in August. Whatever their apprehensions, most generals remained loyal. However, for the first time, there were stirrings of resistance among some individuals in high places, and plans began to take shape to have Hitler deposed in the event of a strike against Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>Probably nothing would have materialised. There were inevitable weaknesses in the clandestine planning, the most obvious being a dependence on the willingness of the army's commander-in-chief, Walter von Brauchitsch, a weak reed if ever there was one, to support a coup. But in any case the hopes of the plotters were destroyed by Chamberlain. Wedded to his policy of buying off Hitler, and determined to save Europe's peace, Chamberlain had desperately embarked on shuttle-diplomacy, flying on September 15 to visit Hitler at Berchtesgaden, then a week later at Bad Godesberg. The German dictator simply increased his demands. Even now, Chamberlain was persuaded that Hitler was speaking the truth in wanting no more than \"racial unity\" with the Sudeten Germans. But his personal appeal to Hitler fell on deaf ears. War seemed inevitable. </p> <p>Then the near impossible happened: Hitler backed down. Britain, supported by France, had pressed the Czechs into cession of the Sudetenland to Germany. Mussolini had then intervened, appealing to Hitler for a postponement of troop mobilisation and acceptance of a negotiated settlement along the lines of the British proposal. Being effectively given what he had claimed he wanted, Hitler conceded with bad grace. The result was the infamous carve-up of Czechoslovakia in the Munich agreement on September 30, decided at a four-power conference of the Germans, French, Italians and British. The Czechs themselves were not present at the mutilation of their own country. </p> <p>Hitler had wanted war to destroy Czechoslovakia completely, not a negotiated settlement for a part of the country. His plans went way beyond the \"homecoming\" of the Sudeten Germans. But when Britain and France agreed to give him what he purportedly wanted without war, he had no pretext to fight. \"You can't carry out a world war on account of modalities,\" his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, remarked.</p> <p>Born out of weakness, with resources and military commitments (in different parts of the world) stretched to their utmost, and rearmament programmes (opposed until late in the day by Labour and the Liberals) still in their early stages, Chamberlain's drive for appeasement was a logical outcome of the years of drift, hesitancy and hope for the best in British foreign policy, coupled with the deep fears of a repeat of 1914-18. His military chiefs advised against going to war. The Dominions did not want to fight over Czechoslovakia. Despite their large army, the French, too, had no appetite for a fight: Verdun was too recent a memory. The League of Nations was by this time scarcely even a paper tiger, devoid of credibility since its divisions and pusillanimity had been so clearly laid bare following Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia in the autumn of 1935. </p> <p>And across the Atlantic, the militarily weak US was only just emerging from the comforting illusion of isolationism and starting to show concern about developments in Europe. On hearing that Chamberlain was on his way to Munich, where a sellout to the German bully was the only outcome in sight, Roosevelt cabled \"Good Man!\" to the British prime minister. </p> <p>All in all, Chamberlain was dealt a terribly bad hand, which, however, he then proceeded to play badly through his mistaken assessment of Hitler's aims and his over-eagerness to placate the dictator with territorial concessions. The only hope resided, as Churchill advocated, in creating a \"grand alliance\" with the Soviet Union to deter and put pressure on Hitler. Chamberlain opposed this. Antipathy to communism undoubtedly played its part. But his stated reasoning was that an alliance of Britain, France and the Soviet Union, evoking the alignment before 1914, would ensure that Hitler went to war rather than pull back from conflict. He was probably right that this would have acted as a provocation to Hitler rather than a deterrent. </p> <p>In any case, the \"grand alliance\" had, in practice, little to offer. Though Stalin claimed his troops were ready to march if Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia, the Red Army - devastated by recent purges - would have had its passage through Poland and Romania blocked. In the west, France was looking for a way out of honouring its commitment to Czechoslovakia, and Britain did not want to be tied through its alliance with France to fighting for a people in a \"faraway country\" of whom \"we know nothing\". So Chamberlain, having laid his poor hand of cards on the table at Berchtesgaden and Bad Godesberg, was forced to surrender them - and with them the fate of Czechoslovakia - at Munich. </p> <p>The elation at having preserved \"peace for our time\", which Chamberlain reported to delirious crowds on his return from Munich (he received 40,000 letters of congratulation), evaporated almost instantly. Shame and national humiliation at what had been done in Britain's name replaced it. Yet many who came to heap opprobrium on Chamberlain after the event had earlier supported the policy of appeasement. Tumultuous cheering came from all sides of the House of Commons when Chamberlain announced he was going to Munich. Members of all parties were eager to shake the prime minister's hand, though it was obvious to everyone what the trip to Munich must mean: that peace could only be saved through sacrificing the Czechs.</p> <p>Was Chamberlain merely buying time, as he still claimed in 1940, when he remained adamant he had done the right thing? What would have happened had Britain gone to war over Czechoslovakia in the autumn of 1938? No military aid from Britain or France would have been forthcoming for Czechoslovakia. Probably Hitler's forces would have quickly vanquished the Czechs (as war games predicted). Internal opposition in Germany would have come to nothing. A phoney war somewhat similar to 1938-39 would have set in a year earlier. True, German forces and defences in autumn 1938 were nowhere near as strong as they were by spring 1940. But Britain's forces were at that time proportionally still weaker. Given the pressure to act, the weakness of his adversaries, and his own temperament, Hitler would probably have invaded France in 1939, which would have necessitated some (temporary) deal in the east with the Poles or the Russians. The French may well have caved in as they did in 1940. </p> <p>Whether Churchill would have assumed the premiership in Britain and succeeded in bolstering morale and defiance had war commenced a year earlier cannot, like much else, be known. But without his leadership, Britain might have been tempted to look for a settlement that would have left Germany in the ascendancy in Europe. Who knows? What did not happen is open only to the realms of fantasy, not the methods of historical research. But it is at least feasible that Chamberlain's capitulation at Munich proved ultimately beneficial to Britain - if at the expense of the Czechs and lasting national ignominy.</p> <p>Each of the crises over Austria and Czechoslovakia had a crucial effect on Nazi anti-Jewish policy and paved the way for the third major crisis of 1938: \"Crystal Night\". Though foreign policy and the persecution of the Jews are usually treated separately in the literature - Hermann Graml's Antisemitism in the Third Reich (1992) and Saul Friedl\u00e4nder's Nazi Germany and the Jews: The Years of Persecution (Phoenix, 1997) have to stand proxy for a vast literature on the latter - it is important to recognise the connections. These emerge plainly in the events surrounding the nationwide pogrom of the night of November 9-10 1938.</p> <p>The pogrom was not planned. However, it was also no accidental development. The occasion was the shooting by a young Jew of a German embassy official in Paris, Ernst vom Rath, on November 7, and his death two days later. Goebbels, with Hitler's express approval, seized the opportunity to spur on party radicals throughout Germany to give vent to the \"anger of the people\" and unleashed the orgy of violence that destroyed synagogues and other property, led to the brutal beatings and often death of hundreds of Jews, and ended with 30,000 male Jews being rounded up and sent to concentration camps as blackmail to dredge up the money to pay for their emigration. Hurried legislation was passed to force Jews out of the economy altogether, and to levy a huge, cynical \"fine\" on them - effectively for having provoked the destruction of their own property.</p> <p>Anti-Jewish violence had been escalating for months before the pogrom. Hitler had given the green light to a new wave of attacks on Jews in a tirade at the party rally in September 1937. Soon afterwards the drive to \"Aryanise\" the economy took hold and accelerated throughout 1938 as German big business, keen to maximise profits from the booming armaments industry, eagerly colluded in pressure to force Jewish concerns to sell out for knock-down prices. The economic assault on Jews was accompanied by a raft of discriminatory legislation turning Jews increasingly into pariahs on the fringes of society. And as the year progressed, the violent attacks on Jews, their property, businesses, synagogues and cemeteries drastically intensified. The growing assertiveness of the regime played its part. So did the radicalisation of anti-Jewish policy that followed the Anschluss.</p> <p>The savagery towards Jews on the streets of Vienna immediately following the Anschluss, as the pent-up aggression of Nazi hordes was let loose, surpassed even what had happened in Germany itself since 1933. The uncontrolled violence soon gave way to the more orchestrated violence of organised expulsion in the hands of the man whose ability to force out Austrian Jews established the reputation that would take him to the role of manager of the \"final solution\": Adolf Eichmann. In Germany, attacks on Jews provided a useful distraction for Nazi gangs in a summer of mounting tension. Then the Munich agreement gave a great boost to the regime's self-confidence. By the autumn, the antisemitic climate was extraordinarily menacing for Jews. The powder keg was ready to explode. It needed only a spark. Vom Rath was shot. Crystal Night followed.</p> <p>There was now a stampede to get out of the country, producing a refugee crisis. Around 120,000 escaped over the next few months. But the door to emigration was only partially pushed open. The barriers against acceptance of Jewish refugees, recently reinforced at the international conference at Evian in France in July 1938, prevented many from getting away. Chamberlain agreed to some easing of admission to Britain of Jewish refugees fleeing Germany. But appeasement was only temporarily suspended, not abandoned. He expressed hope that the \"moderates\" in Germany might even now restrain Hitler.</p> <p>In Germany itself, the unpopularity, which went deep into Nazi circles, of the violence of the pogrom (though not of the aim of removing Jews) meant that such an open outrage was not again tried within the Reich. Something even more sinister happened. In January 1939, responsibility for finding a solution to the \"Jewish Question\" (still through forced emigration) was handed over to the security police - clearing a path that would end in the gas chambers. There was no thought of gas chambers at the end of 1938. But in the fetid anti-Jewish atmosphere before and after the pogrom, notions that war would bring a showdown with the Jews - seen as responsible for Germany's defeat in the first world war and now viewed as pernicious agents in agitating for a new war - were voiced by leading Nazis. These marks of a genocidal mentality found their most outright expression in Hitler's baleful \"prophecy\" made in his big speech to the Reichstag on January 30 1939 that \"if the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevising of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe\".</p> <p>At the end of 1938, then, the twin Nazi aims - expansion to gain domination in Europe, and \"removal\" of the Jews - had blended into the vision of a war soon to be fought and the destruction of the Jews as an outcome of that war. The appeasers, by means of their sellout of Czechoslovakia at Munich, had bought a respite. They had not, even now, given up. Only when, in March 1939, Hitler tore up the Munich agreement and occupied what was left of the Czech lands did the scales finally fall from their eyes. Another crisis, now over Poland, was inevitable, with Britain and France finally committed to action in the event of German aggression. Hitler thought the western democracies would give in over Danzig as they had done over the Sudetenland. This time he was wrong. This time there was war.</p> <p>Looking back at 1938, we see \"old Europe\" approaching its end, before war enveloped it and before the entry on to the scene of the superpowers that would determine the ruined continent's postwar destiny. It is not a pretty sight - a Europe of bitterly competing nations, riven by the age-old clashes for dominance, now taking place in an era of hyper-nationalism with its attendant imperialist ambitions, buttressed by the technologies of total war and mass death. </p> <p>Seventy years on, our present Europe, for all its flaws and faultlines, provides such an attractive contrast that it is hard not to see the European project that arose from the lessons of the second world war and out of the far-sightedness of, especially, postwar German and French statesmen as a huge success story. The main objective of these postwar visionaries was to prevent circumstances ever again arising in which European nations could go to war with each other. The former Yugoslavia gives an example of what, not long ago, was still possible outside the framework of what became the European Union. Though \"1938\" will not be repeated, the crisis spots have moved elsewhere. The dangers to world peace are different, but still present. Having come this far, logic suggests that we need to look to a future in which, without any loss of national identity, a European voice can speak more strongly and urgently for the interests of a united continent than can the current prevailing and persistent dissonance. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ian Kershaw's Hitler is published by Allen Lane.</p>",

  "<p>Yesterday's figures showing that the economy ground to a halt in the second quarter of the year - as compared with growth of 0.2% in provisional figures - is bad news for Gordon Brown and for all of us. It ends an unprecedented period in Britain's recent economic history during which the output of the economy has expanded for 63 successive quarters and brings the spectre of a recession nearer. The way things are going, the UK will count itself lucky if it escapes with only two quarters of negative growth, the usual definition of a recession. Recent statistics have been almost remorselessly bad: unemployment is up, business investment down, manufacturers much more gloomy, the housing market still very depressed despite a recent mild recovery - and the credit crunch goes on like a continuous descant in the background. It is no consolation that the rest of Europe seems to be accompanying the UK into economic stagnation.</p> <p>If you believe official statistics, one of the few bright spots is the volume of retail spending which is reported to have surged by 0.8% last month to 2.1% above a year earlier. If this buoyancy were real and sustainable then the economy might avoid a recession. The problem is that the British Retail Consortium, which represents much of the industry, does not believe the figures. Its own surveys point to falling sales year-on-year. Part of the explanation may be that people are buying cheaper substitutes to offset the impact of rising food prices on their living standards. According to the research firm TNS, two of the UK's big three discount food chains, Aldi and Lidl (the other is Netto), boosted sales by almost 20% and 12% respectively in the quarter to August. No recession for them. Two of these are not members of the retail consortium and the organisation will not say whether they took part in the confidential survey which, it emphasises, is a representative sample. In any case, the three discount stores account for barely 6% of retail sales, so even if they were not included, it would not make a significant difference to the outcome.</p> <p>It is undoubtedly sensible to switch to cheaper alternatives on the high street, just as it is to drive more slowly to offset higher petrol prices. But this cannot disguise the fact that, with inflation rising and earnings slowing, it is well-nigh impossible to avoid a squeeze on living standards. The only question is how long it will last before exports or business confidence revive. As Lombard Street Research pointed out yesterday, UK firms outside the financial sector are flush with cash and well-placed to lead a recovery when it comes. The question is how long that will be and whether continuous pessimism will feed on itself to make a bad situation worse. In the exceptional circumstances of the moment - with rising food and energy prices piled on top of a global credit crunch - an outcome of a couple of quarters of negative growth might look as if we are getting off lightly. Not for Mr Brown, who built his reputation on sound economic management and who, on more than one occasion, pledged to abolish the trade cycle in order to escape from the stop-go economics that had tarnished past Labour governments. </p> <p>There is an optimistic scenario - that the economy narrowly avoids two quarters of contraction for the next 12 -18 months when falling inflation revitalises spending power. Until then there is not much Mr Brown can do unless he throws caution to the wind by spending enhanced oil revenues on priorities such as social housing. But there is something the Bank of England can do. If it is confident that inflation will fall significantly once the recent rises in food and energy costs pass through the system, then it should cut interest rates now because changes in monetary policy take many months to filter through to the economy. The excuses for not doing so are wearing thinner and thinner as each new statistic is published.</p>",
  "<p>Here in America we are experiencing a wave of superhero movies. Some say this has to do with a pervasive sense of impotence in the face of a disappointing government and/or global warming and/or the feeling of fear, bordering on paranoia, that has suffused the national discourse since 9/11. My feeling is, people like seeing men in tight clothes and capes doing impossible things. I know I do.

A steep profit decline saw the bank reduce the price of the shares on offer and abandon a plan to sell 20% of the business to US private equity firm TPG. Investors sold heavily over the ensuing months and the shares dived below the new, 55p offer price. The offer closed at the end of last week, with Citigroup and UBS left holding more than 70% of the stock. </p> <p>An agreement that they could offload their holdings over the following week came to a close yesterday. </p> <p>B&amp;B revealed that the banks were rebuffed by all but four shareholders and forced to approach its high street rivals to honour their obligations as sub-underwriters.</p> <p>The investment banks were joined by HSBC, Lloyds TSB, HBOS, Barclays, Santander's Abbey and Royal Bank of Scotland, which had all agreed to buy the shares if investors refused to take up their rights.</p> <p>The four institutional shareholders to increase their stakes were Legal &amp; General, Standard Life, Prudential's M&amp;G and HBOS's Insight. The four firms agreed to take up their rights after a high-profile and, in City terms, vitriolic battle against the TPG deal.</p> <p>Citigroup and UBS are expected to end up with as much as \u00a375m of shares.

It also includes shares bought by Barclays Global Investors on behalf of clients. </p> <p>B&amp;B will report interim earnings next Friday, the day that its new chief executive, Richard Pym, will address investors for the first time, though he is not expected to set out his strategy for the lender until the autumn.</p>",
  "<p>Weak and almost certain to get weaker. That's the only conclusion that can be drawn from yesterday's figures showing that the UK economy came to a halt in the second quarter of this year. </p> <p>There was nothing in the data released by the Office for National Statistics to suggest anything other than a long hard winter ahead, in which Britain will have its first recession in more than a decade and a half.</p> <p>The first reason for concern is that the flat picture for growth between April and June is a bit of a mirage. Growth is made up of a number of components - household spending, government spending, investment, inventories and net trade - and in the second quarter households spent less and investment fell heavily.</p> <p>Government spending boosted the economy but had it not been for a rise in inventories - unsold goods that companies have stockpiled - GDP would have fallen by 0.6% on the quarter. But firms could run these stocks down over the coming months rather than producing new goods. The domestic economy contracted in the second quarter of 2008 by 0.3%, as it did in the first quarter. At home, we already have a technical recession.</p> <p>The reason GDP was flat rather than negative was due to trade. Imports were down by 1.4%, but exports fell by only 0.5%. With the global economy struggling, it would appear that even with a weaker pound the UK is not going to be able to trade its way out of trouble.</p> <p>Ever since the start of the credit crunch a year ago, the government has been banging on about how well placed Britain is to weather the storm. Nothing could be further from the truth, since the deceptively strong performance of the economy over the past decade was the result of bubbles in two specific sectors - financial services and housing. Both have now burst, and there is nothing to fall back on. In the latest quarter, construction and manufacturing contracted, the service sector grew by just 0.2%.</p> <p>Finally, there's the stance of policy. While it is clear that consumers are tightening their belts in response to a squeeze on real incomes, the Bank of England is concerned about cutting interest rates while inflation is running at more than double its 2% target and on course to hit 5% over the coming months. The long lags in monetary policy mean that it would probably be too late to avoid the two quarters of negative growth that constitute a technical recession even if the bank moved aggressively now. Any rate cut is likely to be delayed, meaning that growth in 2008 as a whole will be barely 1% and 2009 will be even lower than that. </p> <p>Not good news for a government 20 points behind in the polls and facing an election in less than two years.</p>",

  "<p>The first decade of the 21st century, for want of anything else to define it, will probably be remembered as much as anything for the twin buzzwords Celebrity and Reality. Sure, there was Celebrity in the 20th century, but it wasn't quite as we know it today. There was Reality, too, prior to 2000, but once Reality met Celebrity, it created a whole new strain, a whole new spawn of television to which, frankly, there is no adequate response.

She's done so through a mixture of awfulness, tenacity, appallingness and an understanding that Being Famous For Being Famous isn't just one of the regrettable by-products of modern Celebrity, it's the essence of it. Not to mention belief-beggaring brazenness: before her recent cancer scare, Goody was to star in the Indian Big Brother, and the least surprising aspect of that was just how surprising it was.</p> <p>Abi Titmuss is another bona fide success story, someone who, in a latter-day act of alchemy, has managed to convert the base ore of her modicum of notoriety as John Leslie's ex-partner into a golden, multi-million pound industry, based on Titmuss being Titmuss. She couldn't be invented; no self-respecting writer would ever dare, for fear of being seen to lack subtlety. There's the triumph of Reality over Imagination. Of course, at some point, she had to trade in her dignity. But then, she evidently had no life plans to use it, so why not flog it? </p> <p>Complaining about the Goodys and the Titmusses of this world is, as many sceptics have long realised, as effective as trying to put out a kitchen fire with olive oil. Ignoring them doesn't work either. They are the winners in the now explicitly competitive media environment. Behind them swim a whole flotilla of serial Celebrity offenders. Kerry Katona, for example, must be having a hard time distinguishing between reality and Reality; her long list of appearances as \"herself\" has all but eclipsed the memory that she started life in some sort of troupe, helping to sing pop songs. Tara Palmer-Tomkinson continues to play an effective Tommy Steele to Paris Hilton's Elvis Presley. And then there's Jodie Marsh, someone whose life story and achievements can be summed up in just two words: Jodie Marsh. </p> <p>Neil and, particularly, Christine Hamilton added their own, malign twist to the Celeb game. Once, undergoing the jungle privations of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, or the trials of Big Brother, was a sort of redemption, or rehabilitation, for the Michael Barrymores and Les Dennises of this world, a soul purge. Not so for the Hamiltons. Instead they opted for cleansing by cathode - appear on TV often enough and you'll be noted for appearing on TV often, rather than being the sleazemongers responsible for bringing down John Major's Tory government.</p> <p>These transgressors are all too well known. But what of the more insidious class of Reality Celebs - The Ones Who Should Know Better? John Lydon and Germaine Greer spring instantly to mind. The fact that they walked out on I'm A Celebrity... and Big Brother respectively lends them kudos in the eyes of some, although there is also the sense that both had bitten off more than they could chew; both thought they were bigger than the 21st-century Celebrity Game but lacked the endurance to see it out.</p> <p>This is not an accusation that can be levelled at two of the contestants on Maestro, the Beeb's latest Celeb vehicle, Sue Perkins and Goldie. For this pair, the Reality/Celeb/Competition lark isn't something into which they've launched themselves for the sake of making up a Rula Lenska/George Galloway style surreal, one-off juxtaposition. Perkins has form. Her past credits include The Supersizers, Celebrity Fame Academy, Celebrity Masterchef, Showbiz Poker, Celebrity Big Brother, The Weakest Link Celebrity Special and Celebrity Stars In Their Eyes. This pithy, Radio 4-style comedienne evidently has a strong stomach. Ditto Goldie. Former king of the jungle sound, he's given up trying to chase Wiley off the block. As well as Maestro, he's been in The Games, The Priory and Celebrity Big Brother, among others. Once leaders in their field, now they're the guys that producers call when they're a competitor short. They are professional Goodys and Titmusses. Well, actually, lower than Titmusses, even. Abi is quite the antithesis of a celebrity these days - she acts in theatre. She is Doing Something.</p> <p>So if a Perkins or a Goldie can be sucked so improbably into the Celebrity maw, then what of the future? Boxing has proven a fertile source, with Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn both doing for Celebdom what Frank Bruno did for panto. Expect the increasingly circumferential Prince Naseem Hamed to follow on from them, as well as the increasingly horizontal Audley Harrison.</p> <p>Britpop is another happy hunting ground, as Alex James, formerly of Blur, and Bez, ex-Happy Mondays, have shown. What price Liam Gallagher taking the Celebrity Redundancy Cheque in the near future?</p> <p>Finally, we have The Disgraced, which has given us Neil Hamilton, aristo fraudster Lord Brocket and love rat James Hewitt. Herein lies the ultimate challenge to Reality: Maxine Carr. Get her out to the jungle. If that happens, Reality must surely be the winner.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Maestro, Tue, 9pm, BBC2</p>",

Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> According to its marketing literature, The Residences at 2211 Camelback, an upmarket apartment building in Phoenix, Arizona, is \"a dream within a dream environment,\" where \"life beyond the expected awaits your discovery\". An \"ambience of distinction embraces residents and their guests upon arrival and rewards them with soaring architecture [and] a bountiful treasure of luxury amenities that ensure personal comfort\". There's a fitness centre, business facilities and a boardroom, a massage service, and a rooftop pool terrace with a sun deck and spa, offering \"majestic mountain views,\" all just yards away from \"couture boutique shopping, exquisite dining [and] championship golf\". If John McCain does not win the US presidency this November, his two combined units at 2211 Camelback might provide a consoling setting in which to reflect upon why. So might his ranch on the banks of a creek in Sedona, a couple of hours' drive away, which has three houses on it, or his three-bedroom apartment in Virginia. Or one of a number of other hideaways - the exact number, of course, being precisely McCain's biggest problem at the moment.</p> <p>Whether or not it ends up proving decisive in the outcome of the election, McCain's admission in an interview this week that he does not know how many homes he owns - \"I'll have my staff get to you,\" he promised a reporter for the Washington-based website Politico - certainly had many of the qualities of the perfect political gaffe. Like the first president Bush acting stunned by a supermarket checkout scanner, or John Kerry going windsurfing, it threatened to demolish McCain's man-of-the-people credentials - an especially awkward matter in a campaign in which charges of elitism have been flung about so energetically, and in which winning the votes of struggling lower-middleclass Americans in key swing states is seen as crucial to victory. (It didn't help that McCain, days earlier, had suggested that only those with an income of \u00a33m or more really counted as \"rich\".) </p> <p>Helpfully for Barack Obama, it also raised another theme, one that the Democratic candidate's campaign team felt unable to broach in the attack advertisement they launched within hours: the idea that McCain, who will soon turn 72, is growing so forgetful that he can't recall basic facts about himself.</p> <p>To be fair, the truth about McCain's homes, which are mainly owned by his heiress wife, Cindy (pictured with him, above), or by companies she controls, is complex. To paraphrase Bill Clinton, who arrived at the White House having never owned any home at all, it depends on what the meaning of the word \"home\" is. Do the knocked-together units at 2211 Camelback, worth about $1.7m (\u00a3920,000), count as one or two? </p> <p>Cindy McCain certainly owns a $1m condominium unit in La Jolla, California, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, but it's reportedly occupied by an elderly aunt. A loft-style apartment in Phoenix features \"a giant silver chimney\" extending from the fireplace to ceiling \"about 20ft above,\" one reporter noted - but it was bought for McCain's daughter Meghan. \"The reality is they have some investment properties and stuff,\" McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers told the Washington Post. \"It's not as if he lives in 10 houses. That's just not the case. The reality is they have four that actually could be considered houses they could use.\"</p> <p>The McCain properties, worth an estimated $13m in total, demonstrate a striking homogeneity in their architecture and locations. Counting 2211 Camelback as a single residence, three of them are in Phoenix, or not too far away. Five are apartments in modern tower blocks, and three overlook the Pacific Ocean. Two are in Coronado, near San Diego in California. (Last year, Cindy McCain told San Diego Magazine she comes to the area \"any time I get a chance to\".) </p> <p>The most distinctive is probably the McCain ranch in Sedona, where McCain played host to several potential vice-presidential candidates earlier in the campaign, though the description of it as a \"ranch\" sometimes irritates his opponents. \"McCain doesn't graze cattle or sheep,\" the liberal Arizona blogger David Safier wrote recently. \"He doesn't sell meat or wool. He has about 15 acres of land in Oak Creek near Sedona with a large vacation home ... and about six smaller guest houses... 'Ranch' evokes images of cowboys and horses and cattle roundups ... it makes McCain and [President George] Bush seem like virile, independent men of the land.\"</p> <p>In fact, Bush only purchased Prairie Chapel Ranch - his beloved \"Western White House\" in Crawford, Texas, where he entertains world leaders and relaxes by clearing brush - in 1999.</p> <p>Nevertheless, accusations of housing-related elitism tend to work more effectively in US politics when levelled against Democrats: rightwing wealth, it's implied, is the result of vigorous capitalist success, whereas liberal wealth is hypocritical, suggestive of out-of-touch elitism and feyness - and so it remains to be seen whether McCain's remarks will hurt him to the degree that Kerry was damaged by attacks on his family's home ownership in 2004. </p> <p>In purely factual terms, the two cases are remarkably similar: Kerry, as Republicans took much delight in noting, had the use of at least five homes, again mostly owned by his heiress wife. One of them, notoriously, was a 1485 barn that had been shipped over piece-by-piece from England to Idaho - although not by Kerry but by his wife's former husband, John Heinz III, a Republican. </p> <p>Obama certainly does not live in penury, something upon which the McCain campaign was quick to try to capitalise in the wake of their candidate's gaffe. Obama owns a large redbrick home in Kenwood, a neighbourhood of Chicago, which may or may not be \"a frickin' mansion\" - as Rogers described it - but which does have four fireplaces and a wine cellar. And purchasing it did involve Obama in dealings with the disgraced Chicago businessman Tony Rezko, a donor to his campaign, though the candidate has insisted that he paid well above market price and received no favours. (A McCain ad released on Thursday referred to the Rezko connection as Obama's own \"housing problem\".) Obama also rents a second-floor apartment in a townhouse in the Capitol Hill neighbourhood of Washington DC. </p> <p>As so often in this election season, though, the McCain campaign response ended up sounding peevish, like a playground taunt hurriedly constructed in an attempt to turn Obama's own words against him. \"Does a guy who made more than $4m last year, just got back from a vacation on a private beach in Hawaii and bought his own million-dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses?\" Rogers asked. McCain \"is a guy who lived in one house for five and half years - in prison in Vietnam\".</p> <p>Rezko was not a convicted felon at the time, of course (and, incidentally, there are no private beaches in Hawaii). On the other hand, some of the McCain family's homes may have been smart investment decisions, and their total number really is a question of definition. But it's perception that matters - and the appalling impression made by McCain left his campaign, last night, in the curious position of looking forward to the wall-to-wall media coverage that Obama's vice-presidential announcement was bound to generate: at least it promised to change the subject.</p>",
  "<p>The City was braced last night for Britain's first recession since the early 1990s after the government revealed that belt-tightening by households and business brought growth to a standstill in the second quarter of this year.</p> <p>Adding to the pressure on Gordon Brown to deliver a stimulus package to relaunch his administration, the Office for National Statistics said the economy had performed less strongly than it had earlier estimated. It revised down growth from 0.2% in the three months to June to zero.</p> <p>The annual growth rate slowed to 1.4% - its weakest since the period in late 1992 immediately after the pound left the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday - with manufacturing and construction contracting and the service sector barely expanding. Household spending dropped by 0.1% and investment by companies dipped by 5.3%.</p> <p>Britain has not seen a single quarter of falling growth since the early 1990s, but analysts said last night that the economy was on course to fulfil one definition of recession - two quarters of declining GDP - in the second half of this year.</p> <p>The domestic side of the economy, which excludes trade, has been on the slide since the start of the year as the credit crunch and rising inflation have created a far tougher environment for consumer spending. House building has also slumped as the property market has suffered, prompting calls yesterday from the House Builders Federation for lower interest rates from the Bank of England.</p> <p>But with inflation expected to hit 5%, the City believes Threadneedle Street will delay reducing the cost of borrowing, putting added pressure on the government to boost the economy with a package of tax and spending measures this autumn. George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, said last night: \"For years Gordon Brown boasted about consecutive quarters of economic growth. Now economic growth has ground to a halt and Brown's bubble has burst. Millions of people are paying an unfair price for Labour's economic incompetence and the fact the prime minister didn't put money aside during the good times to prepare for a rainy day.\"</p> <p>Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said: \"We now have official confirmation that the British economy has already reached the point of stagnation. Any further slowdown and we'll be in outright recession. We're now seeing the full extent of the self-delusion which led ministers to believe that everything was well with the British economy.\" </p> <p>Yesterday's figures from the ONS show that the economy has cooled quickly since the start of the global financial crisis last summer. In the second quarter of 2007, quarterly growth of 0.9% left the annual rate of expansion at 3.3%. Subsequently, quarterly growth eased to 0.6% in the third and fourth quarters of 2007, before halving to 0.35 in the first three months of this year. The annual growth rate has more than halved and is set to undershoot Alistair Darling's budget forecast of 2% expansion in 2008.</p> <p>City analysts said the Treasury's prediction of 2.5% growth in 2009 looked even more optimistic. \"The economy now looks set to grow by just 1.2% or so this year, with a very strong chance of a technical recession in the second half,\" said Jonathan Loynes, of Capital Economics. \"And things will be considerably worse in 2009.\"</p> <p>Diana Choyleva, of Lombard Street Research, said: \"There is nowhere for the UK consumer to go but to continue to retrench. Real income growth has slumped as inflation accelerated while nominal pay growth remained subdued. Households can no longer resort to their borrow-and-spend habit.\"</p> <p>A Treasury spokesman said: \"The UK, like other economies, is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices, as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets. The government's priority is to guide Britain through these challenging times, while also supporting those hit hardest as a result of these global factors.\"</p>",
  "<p>Israel last night warned an attempt by peace activists to sail two wooden boats to the Gaza Strip was a \"provocation\" and said it would prevent them reaching their destination.</p> <p>A group of 46 activists set sail yesterday morning from Cyprus and were hoping to reach Gaza later today to challenge the economic blockade Israel has imposed on the strip and to deliver a cargo of 200 hearing aids for a deaf school and 5,000 balloons. Among those on board is a Catholic nun, aged 81, the British journalist Yvonne Ridley and Lauren Booth, sister-in-law of Tony Blair.</p> <p>\"I've been nervous, but today I'm excited,\" said Booth, 41, shortly before the boats sailed. \"It's not about our fear, it's about the people waiting in Gaza, you can't think about anything else.\"</p> <p>Another passenger, Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian with Israeli and US citizenship, said: \"The siege that the Israelis have imposed on Gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law, it is also immoral. Global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it.\"</p> <p>Israel has already warned those on board not to undertake the journey and last night Aviv Shiron, spokesman for Israel's foreign ministry, said the voyage was a \"provocation\" and that \"all options\" were under consideration to prevent the boats reaching Gaza. An Israeli admiral has issued an apparent warning to all shipping to stay clear of waters near Gaza because of an unspecified \"security situation.\"</p> <p>It appears most likely that there will be a standoff with the Israeli navy later today, and that the activists will be arrested rather than being allowed into Gaza. Although Israel withdrew its soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005, it still controls Gaza's air space and sea space, as well as nearly all the border crossings. Until a recent ceasefire with Hamas the Israeli military was mounting regular incursions into the strip, saying it wanted to stop rocket fire into southern Israel. It has imposed a tight economic blockade of Gaza, saying it wants to weaken Hamas, the Islamist group which won Palestinian elections more than two years ago.</p> <p>In a statement issued as they departed yesterday, the activists said they would lodge a legal protest against any attempt by the Israelis to arrest them. </p> <p>\"If Israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships, we will not forcibly resist,\" they said. \"If we are arrested and brought to Israel, we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums ... It is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens have when they organise to stand against injustice.\"</p>",
  "<p>The British government will lose its leadership position on climate change and risk scuppering a global deal to cut emissions if it presses ahead with a new generation of dirty coal power, say leading US scientists and environmental leaders.</p> <p>The heads of three influential groups, representing more than 2 million members, have written to the foreign secretary, David Miliband, warning that the UK proposals for up to eight coal plants threaten the chance of the US joining a post-Kyoto international agreement, due in 2009.</p> <p>It is the first public sign of growing international anger over the plans and will add to pressure on Miliband and environment secretary Hilary Benn to oppose the government's new coal policy in cabinet. Most immediate is the decision on a new coal plant at Kingsnorth in Kent, the site of this month's Climate Camp protest.</p> <p>There has been heavy criticism of the plans to build coal plants without technology to capture and bury their large volumes of carbon dioxide. The letter, revealed to the Guardian, is signed by the heads of the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Natural Resources Defence Council. It argues Britain is in a particularly important position because of \"your government's historic commitment to lead on global warming in Europe and around the world\".</p> <p>Energy minister Malcolm Wicks said: \"As a 'live' planning case I cannot comment on the merits or otherwise ... or on the timing of any decision.\" In a Guardian interview this month, he said new coal power stations were essential for energy security and to allow development of carbon capture technology. Without that technology, \"all is lost on global warming\", he said, because of China's reliance on coal.</p>",
  "<p>AC Grayling's paean to the foreign secretary (The rise of Miliband brings at last the prospect of an atheist prime minister, August 21) ignores why atheism has been seen as a superior force in human affairs. The European religious wars of the 17th century proved the violent potential of religion and paved the way for more humanistic traditions, and atheism should be viewed in that sense.</p> <p>However, the 20th century also proved that atheists are no less warlike than their religious counterparts, and in fact even better at murdering others for an ideology. Were Stalin or Hitler religious? It is silly to argue that Bush and Blair launched the Iraq war because God told them to do so. This line of thinking reduces the causes of that war to absurdities that ignore oil politics and the fight for geopolitical influence.</p> <p>The Pope opposed the war. He must have been talking to a different God than Blair's, and presumably that God is a peaceful atheist. I am an atheist but I much prefer religious people opposing unjustified violent wars to atheists bringing democracy to the rest of the world by shedding blood. Once you endow an ideology like atheism with superior moral qualities that it does not possess, you are talking like a convert. Grayling sounds very religious indeed.<br><strong>Satya Pradhan</strong><br>London</p> <p>As a practicing member of the Church of England, I think it is worth adding to the torrent of letters responding to AC Grayling to say that I have no difficulty in agreeing with virtually everything the professor has to say. There is, though, one proviso: the attributes and qualities he admires are not the sole preserve of atheists, nor are the shortcomings of \"religionists\" only visible to atheists.</p> <p>It is a useful exercise to line up some of the weaknesses and failings of religion, but one needs to be wary of going on to suggest that such faults are religion's only - or at least main - attributes. There are many \"religionists\" who are keenly aware of these and many other shortcomings and reject and resist them too.<br><strong>Jerry Scott</strong><br>York</p> <p>AC Grayling has hit the nail on the head. We need leaders who do not defer to any one interest group but who give attention to all groups, regardless of religious affiliation or non-affiliation. An atheist leader would be a significant move away from the political/religious bias that blights much of western democracy, especially in the US where, if candidates for office do not profess religious adherence, they will be vilified. I see no reason why in a secular society, religious leaders and groups deserve any special deference, influence or recognition.<br><strong>Marc Loewenthal</strong><br>Wembley, Middlesex </p> <p>The real problem with AC Grayling's argument is that his childish piety in the powers of reason prevents him from engaging in any serious argument beyond the secular equivalent of a sort of Sunday-school analysis: that religion is bad and that reason is always and everywhere reasonable. For surely some of the key problems today are the unquestioned authority of neoliberal economics, the increasing powers of the state and the growing reach of global corporations. From this perspective, faith in the \"invisible hand\" of the market is a kind of piety all of its own.<br><strong>Philip Swift</strong><br>London</p> <p>What are the neutral facts upon which AC Grayling's secular society is based? The Darwinian principal of survival of the fittest? Nietzsche's \u00fcbermensch supermen and their will to power? It makes the archaic religious rule of \"love your neighbour as yourself\" and the liberal, tolerant Church of England seem attractive.<br><strong>Ulric Gerry</strong><br>Wembley, Middlesex </p> <p>So AC Grayling thinks we would be better served by a leader who shares his outlook on life.

  "<p>To traditionalists, they will probably never change. Manchester City will always be the attractive, loveable losers while, down the road, their enemies get all the trophies. City get by on spirit and gallows humour and a general acceptance that things will always go wrong. It is all part of the charm, the endearing qualities that have led their former manager Joe Royle to talk of a disease called \"Cityitis\", Sir Alex Ferguson to nickname their stadium the \"Temple of Doom\" and their supporters to fear they will always be in the shadow of their overbearing neighbours.</p> <p>And then there is Garry Cook, headhunted by Thaksin Shinawatra three months ago to become their executive chairman and clearly a man who wants to look at the stars in the sky rather than the mud in the gutter. A man who believes City can be the biggest club in Manchester. \"And we will,\" he says. \"Can we be as big, or bigger, than Manchester United? Yes. Can we win the Premier League? Yes. Can we win the Champions League? It will take time, probably 10 years or more. But if I didn't think that, I wouldn't be here.\"</p> <p>It is a staggering prediction at a time when Thaksin has \u00a3800m of assets frozen in Thailand and Mark Hughes's body language is so downbeat. Yet Cook is deadly serious. \"The truth is that this club is not going out of business, it is not bankrupt and we currently have good offers in for four players. I know what's ahead and I know Thaksin's ambitions. He still wants to buy the Ronaldinhos of this world and he knows he can do that only if he has an abundant amount of cash.\"</p> <p>There is, he admits, a \"cash challenge\" in the short term. City have taken out a \u00a330m bank loan to help them through, he confirms. \"Do we have \u00a340m in the bank to buy new players? No.\" Yet Cook is encouraged because Thaksin is talking to some of the world's richest men about investing in the club. They have had \"Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on the phone\" and met \"the second richest man in China\". Funding is on its way. \"We have five or six different options and we want to get it done in the transfer window because we need three or four players.\"</p> <p>The important thing is that Thaksin will continue to bankroll the club. \"As he resolves his issues in Thailand, the anticipation is that he will get some of his money back.\" Does the one-time billionaire have bank accounts outside Thailand? \"I'm going to assume he doesn't,\" says Cook. \"All I know is that he has some very wealthy friends.\"</p> <p>Thaksin is \"embarrassed about the indignities he has brought on the club\" and willing to stand down as a director. Yet Cook has misgivings about the Premier League's fit-and-proper-person test. \"It is a very loose term, almost tongue-in-cheek, because there have been plenty of unfit and improper people in the league over the last 10 years.\" He talks of a sport rife with \"greed and jealousy - I won't use the word corruption but wherever there's greed and jealousy there will be something else that follows it\".</p> <p>As for working for a man who has been described by Human Rights Watch as a \"human rights abuser of the worst kind\", Cook replies: \"He's embroiled in a political process and I've chosen to stay out of it. Is he a nice guy? Yes. Is he a great guy to play golf with? Yes. Does he have plenty of money to run a football club? Yes. I really care only about those three things. Whether he [Thaksin] is guilty of something over in Thailand, I can't worry. I have to be conscious of it. But my role is to run a football club. I worked for Nike who were accused of child-labour issues and I managed to have a career there for 15 years. I believed we were innocent of most of the issues. Morally, I felt comfortable in that environment. It's the same here.\"</p> <p>Not everyone will be satisfied, but Cook is more bothered about the \"10-year plan\" to become a \"global empire\" and bringing in a box-office signing. \"We need a superstar,\" he says. \"I've talked about this a lot to Mark and he sort of understands. China and India, 30% of the world population, need a league to watch and we want Manchester City to be their club. To do that, we need a superstar because, no disrespect, Richard Dunne doesn't roll off the tongue in Beijing.\"</p> <p>The obvious question is: shouldn't it be up to Hughes who they sign? Cook says there would be a \"heated debate\" if Hughes objected. \"When we talked to Mark about coming to this club we said, 'Don't come if you don't think you need a superstar.' He said he wanted to challenge himself by managing the best players.\"</p> <p>Yet Hughes was lukewarm, to say the least, about the drawn-out pursuit of Ronaldinho. As Cook admits, the former Blackburn manager has simpler tastes. \"Mark is adamant he wants Premier League experience because that is what let us down last season. Mark's a homegrown lad, very old school. He'd rather sign players he knows, even overpay. That's an endearing piece of what he's all about. He doesn't like the unknown because it takes him out of his comfort zone. He jumps out of his comfort zone when we say to him, 'Hey, you've got to change this up a little bit.' But he can't have Roque Santa Cruz so now he's back in his 'uncomfortable zone', which is that he will have to bring in someone new and develop them.\"</p> <p>Hughes, he says, was unfortunate because Sven-Goran Eriksson's recruiting from abroad meant City had \"players who weren't right for the club\" - especially in \"the dead of winter when the players are putting on gloves and tights, there are five games in 10 days and it's bloody tough\".</p> <p>Hughes was said to be against City's plans to sell Vedran Corluka and Stephen Ireland. Cook's take is very different. \"Mark's assessment was that he had seen the players he wanted to keep and the areas where he felt we could do better. There were a couple of players we looked at [selling] because Mark said he wanted to bring in better. We went out to sign those players, they didn't come and we were left holding the baby.\" </p> <p>It hardly represents a vote of confidence for Corluka and Ireland, but Cook is unapologetic. \"Everyone's for sale. If they want to stay at this club they will have to aspire to it.\"</p> <p>The better news for Hughes is that Thaksin will not, according to Cook, automatically sack him if City fail to reach the last six. \"Thaksin has said himself, 'I probably made some mistakes last season.' He realises he needs to give the manager more room, be more patient.\"</p> <p>Thaksin, however, has not had a complete change of personality. As Cook says: \"If I were to ask him, 'Is it true we haven't got any money?' he'd fire me on the spot.\"</p> <p><strong>In pursuit of a global brand</strong></p> <p>By his own admission, Garry Cook has radical views on football that not everyone will agree with, not least his belief that there should be a new top division of 10-14 elite clubs with no promotion or relegation. 'The fans,' he says, 'would find a way to get passionate about it.'</p> <p>A Birmingham City fan, with a part-West Midlands and part-American accent, Cook previously worked in an executive role for Nike in Portland, Oregon, becoming president of the Nike Jordan Brand.</p> <p>The Premier League is '10 years behind' the US in merchandising. 'This is the most powerful sports league in the world but also the most undervalued.' Manchester United had not 'even scratched the surface and if anyone's got a headstart it's them'.</p> <p>As for City, he says their behind-the-scenes operation is a 'shock to me' explaining: 'You look at our brand and it's Thomas Cook. There's something not quite right about watching us in a bar in Beijing or Bangkok or Tokyo and seeing \"Fred Smith's Plumbing, call 0161 ...\"'</p> <p>He was angry when a side of ex-players won the Masters tournament 'using our name and our badge when they had nothing to do with us - then, lo and behold, we congratulate them in the programme. You couldn't set up a band and call it the Drifters, so what are they doing using our name?'</p> <p>He sees City becoming a 'global empire' and 'bigger than Manchester United' but feels the club is undermined by leaks to the media and suggests there is 'someone inside the club with a vendetta'.</p> <p>He is unimpressed, too, with some of the footballers he has encountered. 'They don't understand their responsibility to the club,' he says.

A village in the Champagne region of France with just under 2,000 inhabitants, it was cut off from the railway network after the second world war and lay forgotten.</p> <p>As France roared into a new era of high-speed train travel - or train \u00e0 grande vitesse (TGV) as it is known in France - that linked up big cities, the provinces were left out in the cold.</p> <p>Now, however, Bazancourt is back on track. Its dilapidated station has been given a lick of paint and restored to its former glory. The missing letters from its name have been fixed back on the freshly white-washed walls. </p> <p>As of 1 September, twelve trains from the regional network will stop at its modernised platforms every day and the locals are claiming victory in what they have called the \"battle of Bazancourt\".</p> <p>\"We have been fighting for years for this and now at last it's happened,\" said Michel Jahyer, president of an association pushing for the reopening of smaller stations in the region around the city of Reims. \"For 40 years the policy of the SNCF [public rail network] has been to focus almost entirely on the TGV. It was always the TGV. They have been totally uninterested in the rest of us.\"</p> <p>Jahyer, for one, is delighted with what many are hailing as the revival of France's regional railways. He will now be able to travel to Reims in just 11 minutes, a distinct improvement on a half-hour car journey or winding bus tour which takes an hour to do the journey of 16 miles. </p> <p>The village's teenagers will be able to come home from school on their own, the car-less elderly will be relieved of their isolation and commuters will be freed of the costs of parking and petrol.</p> <p>But it is not just in Bazancourt that this is happening. All over France authorities are showing signs of waking up to the needs of the provinces after years in which high-speed, inter-city links have been the unquestioned priority. </p> <p>From Provence to the outskirts of Paris, disused lines are being reactivated, small town stations reopened and new networks built. </p> <p>At the same time, in a summer of soaring petrol prices and plummeting spending power, many French people are starting to make changes to the way they move around. Fuel consumption is down. For the first time in 30 years, car use is down as well. </p> <p>Public transport is facing its highest demand in years - and one French news magazine asked this month whether these trends indicated a new era and \"the end of the reign of the car\". R\u00e9gis van Herreweghe, a spokesman for the Mayor of Bazancourt, said the changes in his village had clear implications for the wider world. </p> <p>\"This mode of transport has obvious significance in terms of sustainable development in a global context of rising prices and fuel shortages,\" he said. \"Travelling by rail helps people save money and protect the environment.\"</p> <p>Speaking of the need to face up to the demands of a new, energy-efficient era, Guillaume P\u00e9py, the president of the SNCF, said the main challenge of the coming years would be to provide a real alternative to the car. \"This is an incredible chance for the railway, which many people 30 years ago thought had no future,\" he said. \"Today, with the energy crisis, we're moving into a different period. Everyone realises that the car cannot be the only answer.\"</p> <p>Michel Jahyer, meanwhile, is now lobbying the local Champagne-Ardenne authorities for a new railway station at the village of Chatelet-sur-Retourne, just eight miles down the road. </p> <p>\"There are still places without any public transport at all,\" he said. \"No station, no bus, no nothing.\"</p> <p>The battle of Bazancourt may have been won but the war, it seems, will roll on.</p>",
  "<p>The words market garden aren't normally used to describe Walthamstow, a built-up corner of north-east London better known for the greyhound stadium that closed last week. But amid the rows of Victorian and Edwardian terraces there's a thriving home-grown food industry. </p> <p>Last year a small group of volunteers picked 12 tonnes of fruit, that would otherwise have rotted, from gardens and street trees across the borough.</p> <p>OrganicLea's scrumping scheme lets householders keep 25% of the fruit collected, while the rest is sold at the co-op's market stall or turned into juice.</p> <p>Clare Joy of OrganicLea estimates that even in such urban areas, one in four detached or semi-detached houses have fruit trees in their garden, yet much of it simply goes to waste.</p> <p>\"It ranges from street trees and pub gardens to residents who are housebound and unable to pick themselves, and pear-tree owners who are sadly not that keen on pears. We discovered a beautiful Victorian kitchen garden with orchard and hothouse but lacking the full-time gardener it would once have had.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, some allotment holders are fighting the credit crunch by swapping their surplus goods for a free pint down the pub. At The Pigs in Edgefield, near Holt, Norfolk, customers are greeted with a sign that reads: \"If you breed, grow, shoot or steal anything you feel may be at home on our menu, ask at the bar. Let's do a deal.\"</p> <p>So far, pints have been swapped for potatoes, mackerel and a kilo of fresh fruit. Pub regular Derek Feast, 64, exchanges his free-range chicken eggs for a pint. \"I have a job where I earn the national minimum wage, so this little bit of extra money helps me get out,\" he told the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>Organised food swaps - a sort of urban village fete where you can get good food for free by swapping what you've brought - are becoming popular across Britain. The first Great Food Swap was staged by Growing Communities (<a href=\"http://www.growingcommunities.org\">growingcommunities.org</a>) in October 2006 in Stoke Newington, north London. It was so overwhelmed by visitors that it has now become an annual event.</p> <p>The summer may have been a washout, but the wet and warm conditions have been perfect for cucumbers, squash, courgettes and marrows. If you want to sell your bumper crop rather than swap it or give it away, it's not easy. Some allotment associations occasionally rent stalls at farmer's markets, but the cash earned is usually ploughed back into association funds.</p> <p>There are some weekly stalls at year-round markets where allotment holders can take their surplus for sale. OrganicLea runs a weekly market stall, primarily supplied by a farmers' co-op in Norfolk, but it also offers surplus produce from local allotments. The stall takes 25% and the allotment holder gets 75% of whatever is made.</p> <p>There's also the option of roadside sales, which are particularly popular with small-scale egg producers. Just five backyard chickens can easily lay 1,250 or more eggs a year, leaving the average family with a surplus of dozens of eggs every week. </p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.allotment.org.uk\">allotment.org.uk</a>, so long as your roadside sales are surplus, and production is not at commercial levels, you can rely on a technical exemption called \"farm gate sales\". </p> <p>But take them to market and the Egg Marketing Inspectorate will be watching to make sure that each one is marked with a producer code number. You are also not allowed to sell to any catering establishments.</p> <p>The law on selling surplus produce from allotments confuses some smallholders. Many allotment associations tell members it is against the law to sell their goods, but that's not entirely correct according to Bryn Pugh, legal consultant to the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners. \"Strictly speaking, produce from allotments cannot be sold, but there should be no objection to the occasional sale of surplus produce. What is prohibited under the Allotments Acts, 1908-1950 (section 22, subsection 1) is that an allotment cannot be used to support a business.\"</p> <p>But he says that if an allotment holder can prove they have more than they can use themselves, it won't be regarded as illegal to sell the surplus. \"There are only so many courgettes you can eat in a week,\" he says.</p> <p>Bend the rules too far, however, and you'll be the disgrace of the green-fingered community. In one case in north-west England last year, an allotment holder was found to be growing soft fruit purely for his wife's jam-making business. \"The tenant was removed. It is totally against the ethics of allotment gardening,\" says Pugh.</p>",
  "<p>As Russian tanks rumbled imperiously across Georgia and French troops were slaughtered in a 10-hour firefight near Kabul, western security policy appeared to be in disarray, challenged on several fronts and struggling to cope.</p> <p>The embodiment of that policy for two generations, the Nato military alliance looked over-stretched, under-resourced, and hobbled by bureaucratic infighting among its 26 member states.</p> <p>When their foreign ministers met in Brussels to deliver a response to Russia's invasion of Georgia, the crisis was promptly compounded by the news of the worst French losses in 25 years at the hands of the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Nato's secretary general, found himself having to explain the alliance's value. \"It is worth what it has been worth since 1949. That's my short answer,\" he said.</p> <p>But there are plenty of policy makers in Brussels, from Nato and the EU, who increasingly wonder whether that statement of purpose is warranted.</p> <p>\"Terrorism, radicalisation, climate change, energy - these are the biggest security threats nowadays and they are not something Nato can do much about. It doesn't have an answer,\" said an EU official, who wished not to be named. </p> <p>Born in 1949, Nato's original function and purpose was to keep the Soviet Union at bay and keep the Americans in Europe. But in recent years the alliance has suffered from strategic confusion while morphing into a very different organisation. Nato has become a global gendarme, fighting wars far away from its \"North Atlantic\" core, peacekeeping, and expanding civilian control of the military in new democracies through its policy of admitting countries from the Balkans and the former eastern bloc.</p> <p>This week's events in Georgia and Afghanistan throw Nato's very different dilemmas and missions into sharp focus.</p> <p>\"For the last five years we have been increasingly focused on being an expeditionary force [in Afghanistan],\" said an unnamed Nato diplomat. \"Now we have to struggle with the return of the classical Nato challenge [in Georgia] and we're going to have to manage to do both.\"</p> <p>Vladimir Putin's throttling of Georgia, say analysts and diplomats, presents big risks and big opportunities. \"The era of Russian weakness is over. We're now in a much more competitive relationship with Russia and Georgia has put European security back on the geopolitical map, also for the US. All that could mean a rejuvenation of Nato,\" said Tomas Valasek at the Centre for European Reform.</p> <p>The new Nato states in the Baltics and central Europe are not, unlike the US or Britain, preoccupied with terrorism, Afghanistan, or Iran's nuclear potential. Their bugbear is the Kremlin. The Czechs and the Poles have agreed to host the Pentagon's missile defence system not because they worry about Iranian missiles, but because they feel more secure by having US troops permanently on their soil for the first time.</p> <p>\"If we said no to the Americans, there's a danger the transatlantic alliance could unravel and the Americans could leave Europe. We think that would be a disaster,\" said a Czech official.</p> <p>For small west European countries, too, Nato's value includes keeping the US committed to Europe's defence and engaged in its politics.</p> <p>\"For the Czechs, Nato is existential,\" said a Dutch EU official. \"But for the Dutch or the Portuguese Nato is also about looking to the Americans to keep the big European powers in check.\"</p> <p>In Afghanistan, Nato critics and loyalists agree, the alliance's first ground war is deciding its future. With the Taliban resurgent and western casualties at their highest since the Taliban were overthrown in 2001, the Senlis Council thinktank declared this week that Nato was failing in Afghanistan. The Nato diplomat said the Taliban were \"having some short-term tactical successes\".</p> <p>The Nato-led coalition's lack of success in Afghanistan has exposed divisions caused recriminations, with Germany bearing the brunt of the criticism for its reluctance to put its forces on the frontlines.</p> <p>Germany has also been central to the Georgia crisis, highlighting the limits of Nato's policies towards Russia and its post-cold war policy of expanding into the countries around Russia's rim.</p> <p>At a Nato summit in April, while agreeing that Georgia would eventually join the alliance, Germany undid that promise by blocking US pressure to open negotiations to bring Georgia in. The German veto, admits an unnamed senior US official, emboldened the Kremlin in its invasion preparations. \"Russia misread that decision and saw it as a lack of resolve on Nato's part.\"</p> <p>In a report on the Georgia crisis to be released on Monday, the European Council on Foreign Relations says: \"Moscow is well aware that few Nato members want to extend a mutual security guarantee to a country at war with Europe's biggest neighbour.\"</p> <p>This cuts to Nato's policy flaw. \"The main question is, are you willing to go to war for Tbilisi? I think the answer is no,\" said the EU official.</p>",
  "<p>Like the maiden voyage of the Titanic, my time as controller at BBC1 went very smoothly for a while. It only takes one iceberg, though, doesn't it? And in the summer of last year, I hit mine. What followed was variously called Queengate, or Crowngate, and it of course got mixed up with the whole trust in television crisis that broke over the industry last year, and which has continued lapping at the sands ever since. It has been a grim and unsavoury episode in TV history: money taken from viewers on false pretences; competition winners faked; awards given to the wrong people; the interests - and the votes - of viewers ignored or overruled.</p> <p>Let me be quite clear - we should all feel remorse at this collective lapse of standards. Inadequate systems, poor supervision, investigations, recriminations, apologies - it all has a peculiarly British feel to it, but as we now know from the fireworks and the singing at the Olympic opening ceremony, fakery in TV is a global phenomenon.</p> <p>If TV wants to grow its relationship of trust with its audience in the core area of news, the truth is indivisible. Yet we've spent so much time in the past 12 months talking about deception that I worry that we haven't found time to talk about the other side of the coin: invention. Invention - creativity, call it what you will - is at the heart of what we do. It's what those in the posh seats might call art and the rest of us would call entertainment. That's the baby, and while we're busy throwing out the bathwater, let's keep a firm grip on it.</p> <p>My contentions are few and are as follows: TV is a creative medium; it needs to be free to be creative; its unique power lies in its popularity; and although I respect those who regulate it, the medicine they are ministering may be as likely to kill it as cure it. </p> <p>During my enforced sabbatical after leaving the BBC, I found time for quite a bit of TV viewing that was purely for pleasure. I also found time to read all 137 pages of Ofcom's phase two report into public service broadcasting. What you'll find in this report, and it's echoed in Channel 4's lengthy doorstopper, Next on 4, is a version of TV that is understood by regulators, consultants, strategists and media commentators. It has a language all of its own. Unfortunately, if the person in the street were to overhear us speaking it, they'd wonder what on earth we were on about.</p> <p>Here we have the deathless language of the committee, each word carefully weighed, balanced and rinsed of all life and passion; a definition of public service broadcasting that exists only in the minds of those whose job it is to write such definitions. Maybe this is the necessary rhetoric that TV needs to sign up to in order to access the public money that keeps the whole thing afloat. Maybe this is the equivalent of the Highway Code - it's good it's there, but when driving keep it in the glove compartment, not on the dashboard. Maybe. But I don't think so. Those of us who work at the box office, rather than the box-ticking, end of TV see it - dare I say - in a more realistic light. What sets the medium apart from theatre, from novels, museums and galleries? It reaches millions of people. A typical episode of Coronation Street, on an ordinary Monday night: eight, nine million viewers. It is still, in this highly fragmented world, a mass medium.</p> <p>You might think, if you were attempting to define public service broadcasting for this modern, competitive age, that your very starting point would be: what can we do to help ensure the continuing breadth of TV's appeal? But Ofcom's four purposes - \"informing our understanding of the world\", \"stimulating knowledge and learning\", \"reflecting UK cultural identity\", \"representing diversity and alternative viewpoints\" - are the opposite: a recipe for the niche, the marginal, the worthy. Try hanging them outside a West End theatre. See who buys a ticket. </p> <p>Now, you might say, why is this of concern to someone who is now at ITV? From ITV's point of view, there's a simple answer: stop being a public service broadcaster altogether. Yes, we could do that. TV could split down the middle, like the medieval church. The BBC and Channel 4, beholden to regulators and politicians, take the high road. The rest of us go the other way. Do we really want that? I hope not. TV's at its best when high and low intertwine. </p> <p>Some people think that the journey in audience numbers from nine to eight to seven million has an end point of zero. It's a tempting scenario, but wholly mistaken. Audiences don't only aggregate in large numbers due to lack of choice, they do so because the desire to be part of an audience, to share an experience, is a strong and enduring one. In the past week alone, look at the Olympics; look at the launch of The X Factor. What's big gets bigger, spreads wider, goes deeper. Phone voting, tarnished as it may have been, tells us something we want to hear: viewers care; they're engaged.</p> <p>Trustees, governors, regulators - in all cases, a distrust of TV having mass appeal seems to lurk beneath the surface. Few today, I dare say, remember the redoubtable figure of Lady Plowden, vice-chair of the BBC governors in the 1970s, who memorably described the ITV soap opera Crossroads as \"distressingly popular\". She'd be glad to know that her views are alive and well in 2008. BBC1 is no longer my responsibility, of course. But ITV1 is. The two channels are part of a very small club with very few members. They need defending, and they need sustaining. We can't resist fragmentation, or time-shifted viewing, or multiple platforms. But unless we fight hard to assert the importance of mass audiences, we may find that broadcasting as we know it simply splits into a thousand pieces.</p> <p>Between now and 2012 we have a choice: we could let fragmentation wash the existing order away and seek comfort in TV that ticks the right boxes. Or we can fight to say that the \"broad\" is a key part of \"broadcasting\"; that TV will serve society better if it unites audiences than if it scatters them; that regulators and politicians can make all the highfalutin demands they like, but if people don't turn on to watch, we're all just whistling in the wind.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Fincham is director of television at ITV.

  "<p>Britain's Olympic medal winners should be awarded honours when they return home, Gordon Brown said yesterday, as he pledged to turn Team GB's successes into a decade of sporting triumphs.</p> <p>The prime minister said he was confident that Britain's accomplishments in Beijing would secure greater private sector investment in the London games and lead to a doubling of investment in British sport by 2012. \"Everyone wants to play their part in making the Olympics a success,\" he said. </p> <p>Brown's arrival in Beijing came as it emerged the Chinese authorities have detained a Briton for 10 days for her part in a Free Tibet protest. Downing Street said it did not comment \"on individual consulate cases\". But it is understood the prime minister has taken up Mandie McKeown's case amid a flurry of activity behind the scenes. Police detained McKeown, 41, as she videoed three fellow activists unfurling a banned Tibetan flag near the Bird's Nest stadium yesterday. The men, a German of Tibetan origin and two Americans, are also thought to have been detained.</p> <p>Earlier, Brown said he would be bringing forward an \"incentive plan\" in the next few weeks to encourage business sponsorship of British sport. A government source said ministers were expecting \"something of a bidding war\" between companies wanting to sponsor Britain's champion athletes.</p> <p>\"The challenge now is to turn what has been two weeks of great success into 10 years of sporting triumph for our country,\" Brown said. \"I will leave no stone unturned in my determination to make London 2012 a great success.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he wanted to see honours awarded to medal-winning members of Team GB, Brown said: \"That's a matter for the Queen. I think the country will want to see our athletes honoured and the country will want to celebrate their success and give them the permanent recognition they deserve.\" </p> <p>Brown singled out the 2008 cycling champions Chris Hoy and Rebecca Romero, 400 metres runner Christine Ohuruogu and swimmer Rebecca Adlington for praise. \"Rebecca Romero's story is amazing,\" he said. \"Not content to win a silver medal in Athens in 2004, she decided to change sports.\"</p> <p>Romero gave up rowing in favour of cycling after failing to get the gold in the women's quadruple sculls in Greece four years ago. She becomes the first British woman to win Olympic medals at two separate sports and only the second British competitor ever, alongside Cardiff-born Paulo Radmilovic, who won gold medals at water polo and in the 4x200m freestyle in 1908.</p> <p>After the 2004 games in Athens, Tony Blair used the last set of honours before the 2005 election to reward successful British athletes.</p> <p>Brown said Britain needed to extend its domination in sports such as rowing, cycling and swimming and make further breakthroughs in sports like gymnastics.</p> <p>The government aims to spend \u00a3600m on sport in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics. Brown met the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing yesterday, where he praised the \"spectacular success\" of the Olympics. \"With the whole world watching, the Olympic Games have captured the imagination of the whole global community,\" he said. \"The 2008 Beijing Olympics have set a new standard for the Olympic Games which we in London in 2012 will seek to follow.\"</p> <p>Brown also spoke to Hu about China's stance on Zimbabwe and Darfur, where it has been criticised for supporting repressive regimes. \"He responded by saying that these are issues that will be part of our continuing discussions,\" Brown said. He also raised the issue of Tibet, urging a \"productive\" conclusion to talks with the Dalai Lama's representatives.</p> <p>Brown told reporters he hoped that the temporary relaxation of the ban on some internet sites while the Olympics was on could be made permanent. Britain's success in Beijing has taken some of the pressure off Brown, who has faced a barrage of criticism over his leadership this summer following a number of policy U-turns, dire poll ratings, and a string of byelection defeats.</p>",
  "<p>Hunslet Hawks claim they are in danger of making unwanted sporting history by becoming the first club to be forced out of existence by a wind turbine. The south Leeds club, who were one of the founder members of the Northern Union in 1895, but currently prop up the rest of the professional ranks at the bottom of National League Two, have been stunned by the erection of a 35-metre turbine less than 25m from their pitch at the John Charles Centre for Sport which is also the base for the City of Leeds Athletic Club.</p> <p>\"We've just had no consultation, no notification, it's just appeared on the grass beyond the athletics track,\" fumed the Hawks chairman, Stephen Ball. \"If it stays there, I just can't see how the Rugby League are going to let us play at the ground again, because it makes such a noise and it affects the flight of the ball. When you think that it's a local authority-funded stadium that acts as the base for some top-quality athletes as well, I just can't believe the council would do something like this.\"</p> <p>Ball found enthusiastic support from Veronique Marot, the winner of the 1989 London Marathon who is now the president if the athletics club, and manager of it's women's team. \"It's pretty much glued to the side of the track, with only a bit of grass in between,\" she said. \"We have about 500 athletes who train four or five nights a week, but I don't know how youngsters are going to react when there is a loud buzzing noise from a wind turbine. I'm as green as the next person, but I can't believe the best place to put it in the whole of Leeds is next to an athletics track.\"</p> <p>A Leeds city council spokesman insisted that the turbine would have no effect on the strength of wind at the stadium and that Hunslet and the athletics club had \"misunderstood the science\" but conceded that \"our communication could have been better\". But he said that was due to a late change in the location for the city's first wind turbine after the discovery that the original site interfered with the flight path of bats. </p> <p>However that has not pacified Ball, who also claimed the council had denied access to the stadium to photographers and television crews yesterday. \"We have felt for sometime that the local authority have not been supportive of us,\" he added. \"The club will fight this issue as long as we have breath in our lungs.\" Hunslet do not have another home game this season, as their last two NL2 fixtures are at Keighley tomorrow and Doncaster next week.</p> <p>Wakefield Trinity, who face a tough task in Perpignan against the Catalan Dragons in today's only Super League match, have withdrawn their interest in the St Helens captain Paul Sculthorpe. \"We've been informed by Wakefield that their salary cap won't allow them to enter negotiations,\" said Sculthorpe's agent David Howes, who confirmed for the first time that the former Great Britain loose forward could yet join Salford next season despite recent denials. The 30-year-old hopes to return from his latest hamstring injury tomorrow at Huddersfield, with Saints aiming to finish top of the Super League for the fourth season running.</p> <p>St Helens were the only club to breach the salary cap last season but only by \u00a38,456, which the Rugby Football League accepted was down to an innocent accounting error. The club yesterday confirmed that the former Wigan prop Bryn Hargreaves has agreed a new two-year deal but announced that they will be releasing five players at the end of the season, and sending another four out on loan to keep them under the cap next year.</p>",
  "<p>Thirty-one years ago Gilles Villeneuve was faced with the daunting challenge of trying to learn Silverstone, a circuit he had never seen before, in a pre-qualifying session before his formula one debut for McLaren in the British grand prix.</p> <p>When it was pointed out to him that he had spun a lot, the French-Canadian driver replied: \"Yes, of course! I've had no chance to test. This is the fastest car I have ever driven and the fastest track I have ever seen. I had to learn both in a short time and the quickest way to find the limit was to go quicker and quicker until you go over it. Then you know how quick is too quick.\"</p> <p>The bold plan worked for Villeneuve, whose son Jacques would go on to win the world championship in a Williams 20 years later, and he qualified seventh on the starting grid. In the race Villeneuve reached as high as fifth place at one point before a technical problem pushed him down the field to a final position of 11th.</p> <p>Yesterday Lewis Hamilton was able to deploy the rather more sophisticated resources at his disposal as he began the task of learning the new Valencia street circuit for the first time in preparation for tomorrow's European grand prix at the wheel of his McLaren-Mercedes.</p> <p>Yet even as his grey and silver machine rumbled out of the pit lane in a shimmering heat haze rising from the 44C track tarmac, Hamilton, who was fifth in yesterday's practice, was secure in the knowledge that his efforts were already underpinned by some of the most sophisticated technology available.</p> <p>\"It was quite unusual at the beginning, because everything was so new, even though I'd walked the circuit,\" said Hamilton. \"When you're in the car the corners come up a lot quicker than you anticipated. I just took time to get used to that and was taking notes of braking points, bumps and how much kerb I could use.\"</p> <p>Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren's chief operating officer, explained: \"You never quite know what to expect from a brand new circuit but we have worked very hard over the years to develop simulation techniques which help us considerably in these situations.</p> <p>\"When there is a new track on the schedule the FIA supplies some preliminary information after which we get down to collecting more detailed data from which to build [our computer model]. Our survey team, which first came out here about nine weeks ago, uses information from a high accuracy global positioning satellite and a laser scanner which records every detail of the track surface and its geometry.</p> <p>\"On July 21 we put some other [non-formula one] drivers in the simulator who were going to drive in the preliminary formula three and GT races which were run at the meeting last month when the circuit was opened.</p> <p>\"Then we arranged to put on-board cameras in the cars for these races and incorporated the footage in the simulation programme, which would help give more texture to the circuit in terms of putting the trackside buildings in place.\"</p> <p>Once this had all been completed Lewis Hamilton and Heikki Kovalainen were drafted in to assess the results of all this work and begin the serious process of preparing for the new circuit. </p> <p>Before the first 90-minute session the collective prediction had been for a fastest qualifying lap of around 1min 37sec and the accuracy of the computer predictions looked set to be vindicated after Sebastian Vettel took his Toro Rosso round in 1:40.496 on a dusty track surface in the first session while Kimi Raikkonen trimmed that to 1:39.477 in the afternoon, raising the prospect of pole position being achieved with a time close to the predicted target this afternoon.</p> <p>Some teams will have to make do with less sophisticated preparations, the BMW Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld combining video footage and the simple expedient of walking the circuit as his method of familiarising himself with this new venue.</p> <p>\"We don't have a simulator like other teams do but we have some on paper so I can see speeds, braking and gears, things like that, so we can look at the profile,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I will try and get some footage and I've already seen something on the internet. I don't walk all the circuits any more but on the new ones I will walk and try to do it with a scooter or a car. It helps a bit, I think, walking the circuit, driving it and watching the footage as it gives you a rough idea.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"I Nintendo live for ever, or die trying\" - Mario Marx.</p> <p>Poor Nintendo. Those clever little handheld games in the 80s: small, orange, plastic \"Game &amp; Watch\" devices that opened up like a book. A gorilla threw barrels down at you while you leapt about a beeping LCD world. Then came the NES Game Console, followed by the highly successful Game Boy. After that, things began to go wrong: the Nintendo 64 and its successor, the GameCube, failed to penetrate what was now an enormous market. The oldest video games company of them all was in trouble: Donkey Kong and the Mario Brothers seemed destined to go the way of Atari and Sega, Pong and Sonic the Hedgehog, while the big boys would be left to slug it out with their PlayStations and Xboxes. That was Sony and Microsoft's plan, and no one doubted it would be so. Nintendo, as a games brand, was about as hot as Waddingtons.</p> <p>And then came its \"seventh generation\" offerings, the DS and the Wii (pronounced \"wee\"). The assumption made by Sony and Microsoft was that awesome processing power, state-of-the-art graphics, smooth animation and voluminous storage would make their big beasts market leaders. Nintendo staked all on cheaper devices that stressed a personal relationship between player and machine. The DS was all about a highly portable, stylus-driven environment, while the Wii \u2013 well, the Wii changed the rules completely.</p> <p>The DS and its more streamlined successor, the DS Lite, reached out to women and the middle-aged, and managed to do this without alienating the core gaming audience. Games for teenage girls, games for sudoku-playing commuters, \"brain trainer\" games for fortysomethings \u2013 whole new audiences were being reached, and the units sold in their millions.</p> <p>My DS Lite is pink. There was so much demand earlier this year that they couldn't be had for bribes, sexual favours or worse. Unless you accepted girly pink. The moment you open it, you are taken back to the old Game &amp; Watch days but can see why the DS has succeeded so well with the middle class, the middle-aged and the Hello Kitty/My Little Strawberry Shortcake Pony set. You set up in a twinkle and then play on two screens, one of which accepts stylus input and touches. </p> <p>As well as being backwardly compatible with the Game Boy Advance, there are hundreds of DS-specific games to choose from, some available on all platforms, such as Lego Star Wars; others proprietary and particular, such as Mario Kart. Fashion Dogz, Hannah Montana: Music Jam and Imagine Girl Band look after the all-important little girl sector, while Call of Duty, Race Driver: Grid and endless sports implementations show that your classic boy gamer isn't left out either. He will prefer the versions on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, of course, but Nintendo's whole strategy is to encourage crossover. Adults are turned on to the joys of shoot 'em ups and RPGs, the young discover Space Invaders and Scrabble. That's the theory, and more than 100m units sold make it hard to disprove. The DS is nothing like as feature rich as the PlayStation Portable, but it isn't trying to be. The philosophy seems so counterintuitive at first blush: surely today's digital devices demand the Swiss Army knife approach? If the DS has a touch screen, speakers and controls, then it should offer USB connections, AV and HDMI in and out sockets, memory cards, MP3 and movie playback, Wi-Fi and texting. Convergence is all, no? Well, we humans can be so ornery. A simple pocket knife can be more appealing and usable than a bristling Victorinox, and a dedicated little games machine like the DS can engage us far more than the sleek power of the PSP. You can feel admiration and even awe for the big power boxes, but for the DS you feel affection - and that, in marketing terms, is worth a whole heap more.</p> <p>Next wiik, wii'll take a wii look at Nintendo's other phenomenally successful platform...</p> <h2>Acronym of the week</h2> <p><strong>HDMI </strong>High Definition Multimedia Interface.

  "<p>The Russian-Georgian conflict is being described as the first time cyber-attacks have accompanied an actual war. Last year, the Russian-Estonian spat was described as the first modern cyber-war. These descriptions over dramatise events and are a distraction from the more prosaic, but more serious, danger these illicit cyber-actions represent. The technology used in these cyber-conflicts has only limited strategic impact, but represents a major threat to one of the most successful engines of human freedom and opportunity \u2013 the World Wide Web itself.</p> <p>The strikes against Georgian government websites, along with last April's attacks against Estonian websites, were <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack\">distributed denial of service</a> attacks (DDoS) where many computers simultaneously send messages to a website, preventing legitimate traffic from reaching the site. These attacks are relatively easy to launch, but taking a website down does not affect real world infrastructure and competent IT professionals can counter or at least mitigate DDoS attacks. The increasing volume and sophistication of these attacks is a subject much discussed among IT professionals, but its impact is to create an inconvenience.</p> <p>Theoretically taking down Georgian government sites could have prevented Georgia from publicising its side of the conflict. However, some Georgian sites were migrated to new locations. More importantly, the Georgian government's message was getting out to the world. The problem was that the United States and Nato had limited options for supporting Georgia. In short, the cyber component had no significant known impact.</p> <p>Advanced economies and militaries rely on sophisticated information networks. Damaging or infiltrating these networks will probably be an important component of future wars. The ability to listen in on or disable an enemy's military communications net could be the difference between victory and defeat. It is also conceivable that information inside these networks could be influenced, or that the networks running critical infrastructure - military or civilian - could be infiltrated and used to cause real-world damage. However the skills and technologies needed for these attacks will be highly specialised, and not akin to the DDoS attacks which a relative amateur can launch.</p> <p>Russia, home to a sophisticated core of cyber-criminals, undoubtedly possesses some of these capabilities. But, considering Russia's massive military advantage over tiny Georgia, it is unlikely that Russia would have turned to advanced cyber war to guarantee victory, particularly when deploying it would provide potential future adversaries with valuable intelligence about Russia's cyber war strategies and tactics. In addition, much of Georgia's infrastructure is old and consequently not online and therefore invulnerable to a cyber strike. (The Georgians claim that Russia has targeted their phone system, and while that is possible, it is more likely that Georgian phone systems were overwhelmed in the general crisis accompanying the Russian attacks.)</p> <p>The Russian government may have instigated the DDoS attacks, although the evidence is unclear, and it is difficult to identify the origins of a DDoS attack. It appears that the DDoS attacks were in fact a mass action by regular Russian citizens. For the future of the Web, this is even more worrisome.</p> <p>DDoS attacks typically use botnets, networks of thousands of compromised computers that, unbeknownst to their owners, are used to disseminate spam. Five years ago DDoS attacks and botnets were the domain of highly skilled cyber-criminals. Now, botnets can be rented online, and rentals come with tech support. The massive DDoS attacks on Georgia included botnets, but ordinary citizens joined in, using simple tools distributed online to join in the attacks. The tools of cybercrime are becoming progressively easier to use.</p> <p>The Web was established as an open environment, with minimal governance, that puts a premium on individual liberty and initiative. This openness has been essential to the Web's success as a tremendous engine of creativity, opportunity, and liberty. DDoS attacks that take down websites are bad manners and one threat to the open spirit that underpins the Web. But the technology behind these attacks represents even greater threats.</p> <p>The primary use of botnets is not DDoS attacks, but to perpetrate an ever expanding repertoire of online frauds and distribute malicious software. These activities undermine the physical and moral integrity of the Web. Some estimates are that more than 75% of the emails sent worldwide are spam. With botnets becoming easier and easier to create and manage, the rate of spam is increasing faster than new internet capacity. Spam also represents a moral threat to the Web, as online fraud undermines trust in e-commerce and online communications in general. </p> <p>Governments can better prepare for specific events, such as international cyberspats. There are a number of improvements that could be made in coordination and in developing early warning systems. But the systemic issues also need to be addressed. Software designs need to be improved to reduce the vulnerabilities that cyber-criminals exploit and the public needs to be better educated about safer online behaviour. Major Web users such as governments, ISPs, universities, and corporations need incentives to better secure their networks, and educate their users. Finally, serious efforts must be made to develop international laws that can prevent increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks and to prosecute cyber-criminals. All of these steps are costly, but without them more draconian efforts that impinge on individual privacy may be needed to keep the Web viable.</p> <p>The cyber-component of the Russian-Georgian conflict was only a sideshow, but it highlighted the threats facing one of history's great promoters of freedom and innovation - the World Wide Web.</p>",
  "<p>Political scientists Stephen Brown, Chandra Lekha Sriram and Marie-Jo\u00eblle Zahar are right in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/20/zimbabwe\">pointing out</a> the perils of a quick-fix power-sharing solution in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>They view a unity government as an untidy and \"inherently undemocratic\" outcome but they are less successful in outlining possible alternatives for ending the political deadlock in Harare. Their suggestion that Zimbabwe should hold fresh elections under a caretaker government is fanciful at best because Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party is unlikely to agree to a new poll.</p> <p>In any case it is difficult to see how a credible election can be held in the toxic environment that Mugabe and his shock troops have created in Zimbabwe today. Given Zimbabwe's weak institutions and partisan security forces, fresh elections would do very little to deepen the democratic culture.</p> <p>The international community has been urging the main opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, and his MDC party to push for \"full executive authority\". Although this is desirable, Mugabe and Zanu-PF are unlikely to cede complete control - therefore Tsvangirai needs to take a more realistic approach.</p> <p>Rather than quibbling over what amount of power he will exercise in a new coalition government, the opposition leader might be wiser to demand a framework for genuine reforms under a unity government.</p> <p>Constitutional changes that would shield the judiciary from executive interference and change the current system where judges are handpicked by a compliant Judicial Service Commission, for example, would offer a significant check on the all-powerful presidency. An independent judiciary could be a powerful guarantor of Zimbabwe's democracy down the road while serving as a deterrent to the militias that have wreaked havoc in the country, safe in the knowledge that there would be no consequences for their actions.</p> <p>Similar changes to guarantee the independence of the electoral commission and strip the presidency of powers to appoint its members would be an invaluable tool in safeguarding the integrity of future elections.</p> <p>The impact of genuine reforms would be to insulate Zimbabwe against a reversion to one-man rule, entrench the concept of separation of powers between various arms of government and possibly offer a window for cleaning up the security forces. This would be a far better platform for sustainable change in Zimbabwe than fresh elections in the current poisoned environment.</p> <p>Tsvangirai and the MDC have time on their side, mainly because of coming changes in South Africa where ANC leader Jacob Zuma is expected to replace Thabo Mbeki as president in a year's time. This transition will be uncomfortable for Mugabe and Zanu-PF. The Zimbabwean leader has profited from his close ties to Mbeki with whom, as Mbeki's biographer William Gumede <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/africa/2008/06/tsvangirai-mugabe-zimbabwe\">has noted</a>, he shares a kinship rooted in class and history.</p> <p>Mbeki and Mugabe are both well educated and were involved in the liberation struggle. Tsvangirai, by contrast, is a former trade unionist of modest education who did not take part in the guerrilla movement that helped to end white minority rule, a fact that informs Mbeki and Mugabe's dim view of his suitability to lead.</p> <p>The rise of Zuma - like Tsvangirai a man who has been propelled to his position by the powerful trade unions in South Africa - is likely to change all that. Zuma and other powerful figures within the ANC initially regarded Mugabe with sympathy as he cast himself as a champion resisting neo-colonialism and as a victim of imperial conspiracy. As Mugabe has increasingly turned his guns on his own people in his attempts to cling to power that admiration has given way to revulsion. Where Cosatu, the umbrella body of South African trade unions, was once a keen supporter of Mugabe, its members are now more likely to be found leading demonstrations against him. Zuma has also been far more strident in his <a href=\"http://www.zimdaily.com/news/zuma22.4911.html\">public criticisms</a> of Mugabe than Mbeki, a fact which does not portend well for the Zanu-PF leaders.</p> <p>Considering the leverage that South Africa has over Zimbabwe's leadership, it is inconceivable that under a Zuma presidency Mugabe would be able to get away with the virtual impunity he has exercised under Mbeki's watch.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, Tsvangirai refuses to take part in a unity government, his stance could give Zanu-PF an opportunity to go ahead with a unilateral arrangement that excludes the main opposition leader and present this to the rest of Africa as a <em>fait accompli</em> borne of the opposition's intransigence.</p> <p>A lot of commentators have drawn parallels between the deal Mugabe wants to strike with Tsvangirai and the 1987 <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7558578.stm\">unity government</a> with another former trade unionist, Joshua Nkomo. That arrangement ended unhappily for Nkomo whose Zapu party was overshadowed by Zanu and whose career never recovered.</p> <p>But Mugabe may be looking further back into history as he discusses a new coalition government. The state media in the last few weeks have been &lt; a href=\"http://www.herald.co.zw/inside.aspx?sectid=817&amp;cat=1\"&gt;actively supporting a deal that would see Mugabe enter a coalition with the smaller MDC faction led by Arthur Mutambara. Zanu-PF would then attempt to poach opposition MPs with offers of front bench positions to maintain control of parliament. With the Zimbabwean national assembly convening on Tuesday, the next few weeks could yield movements in this direction.</p> <p>Such an arrangement would have echoes of the deal struck between Bishop Abel Muzorewa and the Ian Smith regime in 1979. Smith hoped to freeze out what he viewed as the more radical liberation movement players such as Mugabe and Nkomo by working with Muzorewa. It was a desperate attempt to hold on to power and it did not ultimately succeed. Mugabe's attempt will similarly fail in the long run, though in the short term it will keep him in power while deepening the economic crisis in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>The MDC has few real options outside some form of unity government, but it must insist on enough guarantees to ensure a process of reform with an eye to the Mugabe succession.</p> <p>If nothing else, this arrangement will help to pave the way for badly-needed investment to help lift the economic siege that has enveloped Zimbabwe under Zanu-PF rule. Unlike the politicians, the suffering masses do not have time on their side.</p>",
  "<p>In late 2009, the world's top climate scientists, environmental officials and business and NGO leaders will <a href=\"http://www.cop15.dk/en\">converge on Copenhagen</a> to negotiate a solution to climate change. It will be a meeting with global repercussions, and its participants will be united by a common belief in the need for a comprehensive solution to this common threat.<br> The need for such a solution is supported by the best science available, including the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/07/science/earth/07climate.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;th&amp;emc=th\">report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC), which was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2007 and of which I was a member. The IPCC's message is clear: climate change is real, compelling and urgent - and we need a concerted, comprehensive and immediate effort to confront it.</p> <p>But in the midst of this momentum and clarity, one voice has stood out as a persistent naysayer.</p> <p>Bjorn Lomborg, author of <a href=\"http://www.grist.org/advice/books/2001/12/12/of/\">The Sceptical Environmentalist</a>, makes headlines around the world by arguing that capping carbon dioxide emissions is a waste of resources. He recently published a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/15/carbonemissions.climatechange\">piece in the Guardian</a> in which he dismissed efforts to craft a global carbon cap as \"constant outbidding by frantic campaigners\" to \"get the public to accept their civilisation-changing proposals\".</p> <p>To support his argument, Lomborg often cites the <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Default.aspx?ID=1014\">Copenhagen Consensus project</a>, a 2008 effort intended to inform climate negotiators. But there's just one problem: as one of the authors of the Copenhagen Consensus Project's principal climate paper, I can say with certainty that Lomborg is misrepresenting our findings thanks to a highly selective memory.</p> <p>Lomborg claims that our \"bottom line is that benefits from global warming right now outweigh the costs\" and that \"[g]lobal warming will continue to be a net benefit until about 2070.\" This is a deliberate distortion of our conclusions. <br> We did find that climate change will result in some benefits for developed countries, but only for modest climate change (up to global temperature increases of 2C - not the 4 degrees that Lomborg is discussing in his piece). But developed countries are relatively prepared to handle climate change's effects - they tend to be in colder areas, and they have the infrastructure to mitigate severe depletion of resources like fresh water and arable land. That is precisely why our analysis concluded - and Lomborg ignores - that climate change will cause immediate losses for developing countries and the planet's most vulnerable, millions of whom are already facing challenges that climate change will exacerbate. Downplaying the threat of climate change allows Lomborg to focus on his claim that \"unlike even moderate CO2 cuts, which cost more than they do good, we should focus on investing in finding cheaper low-carbon energy.\" He attributes this finding to our analysis as well, but again he overlooks a key element of our work. Of course the world needs to make significant investments in cheaper, low-carbon energy. But making those investments without also implementing a constraint on emissions would fail to address the problem. Our analysis assumed that over the next century, $800bn will be spent confronting climate change - $50bn spent on R&amp;D in the next 5-10 years, and the remaining $750bn spent on adaptation and mitigation. This allocation of resources will reduce the cost of \"clean\" technology <em>and</em> increase the effectiveness of policies - like capping emissions - that are designed to reduce global CO2. <br> In short, we never advocated research into new technologies as a stand-alone way to fight climate change, nor did we accept Lomborg's dismissive attitude toward the threat climate change poses.  The negotiators in Copenhagen will need credible, accurately reported analyses upon which to base their discussions. This is not the time to deny the scope of the problem or belittle efforts to implement solutions. We need all options on the table. This was the message of the Copenhagen Consensus Challenge paper, and even a sceptical environmentalist should understand that.</p>",

  "<p>Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke came to the rescue of the market today.</p> <p>His <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2008/aug/22/wallstreet.enrc\">comments </a> about inflation put some life back into a Wall Street still worried about the continuing effect of the credit crunch on banks, and by extension lifted London too. By the close the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> had climbed 135.4 points to 5505.6.</p> <p>Talk of Korean interest in struggling Lehman Brothers bank also helped.</p> <p>But not everyone was convinced by Bernanke's words of wisdom.</p> <p>Rob Carnell at ING said: \"Given recent market volatility, one of Ben Bernanke's main goals at a speech like the one he gave today at the Jackson Hole symposium, must simply have been to avoid adding to that volatility. And in that respect, he seems to have managed quite well, by virtually avoiding talking about current economic and financial market conditions.</p> <p>\"To the extent that there was any 'real time' commentary, this acknowledged that the outlook was weakening, and that this justified the current low level of rates. He also noted that falling commodity and energy prices were, alongside the global slowdown, likely to bring inflation lower later this year (we think as early as next month). That said, there was no indication that this might free up the Fed to ease policy further any time soon, with the inflation outlook still 'highly uncertain'.</p> <p>\"The bulk of his speech centred on ways to improve financial regulation, including the new jargon of 'macroprudential oversight'. By this, Bernanke is suggesting that instead of focusing piecemeal on individual firms, central banks should take a holistic approach to the positions taken by the entire market \u2013 which is an admirable goal, though one that may run into problems if banks repeat past history of hiding exposures in off balance sheet vehicles, and as hedge funds still are not subject to the sort of reporting requirements of much of the rest of the financial industry.</p> <p>\"We suspect that spotting a looming financial sector over-concentration of risk may prove as difficult as spotting a bubble in advance, which Alan Greenspan always maintained was impossible. We disagree on the bubble point, but suspect that the goals of macroprudential oversight may provide insurmountable practical difficulties, even if it were to get off the ground.<br>Bernanke also advanced the case for the US Treasury to have the power to intervene early in the case of failing non-bank financial institutions, such as Bear Sterns \u2013 a less ambitious goal, but one that may be more achievable, and indeed, given current developments with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, more pressing.\"</p> <p>There were not many fallers in the FTSE 100 but all of them were resources companies, with miners and oil companies losing ground on a drop in metal and oil prices. <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> lost 29p to \u00a310.33 while <strong>Xstrata</strong> was 59p lower at \u00a331.01. <strong>Tullow Oil,</strong> recently boosted by takeover talk, slipped 3p to 796.5p.</p> <p>On the upside, property group <strong>Liberty International</strong> closed 70p to 945p after US rival Simon declared a 3.45% stake.</p> <p>Insurer <strong>Benfield</strong> - run by Chelsea football club boss Matthew Harding before his untimely demise in a helicopter crash - added 74.5p to 345.5p after a 350p a share agreed offer from US giant Aon.</p>",
  "<p>If you want a glimpse of how the movement against climate change could crumble faster than a summer snowflake, read <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/21/climatechange.kingsnorthclimatecamp?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=commentisfree\">Ewa Jasiewicz's article</a>, published yesterday on Comment is free. It is a fine example of the identity politics that plagued direct action movements during the 1990s, and from which the new generation of activists has so far been mercifully free. </p> <p>Jasiewicz rightly celebrates the leaderless, autonomous model of organising that has made this movement so effective. The two climate camps I have attended \u2013 this year and last \u2013 were among the most inspiring events I've ever witnessed. I am awed by the people who organised them, who managed to create, under extraordinary pressure, safe, functioning, delightful spaces in which we could debate the issues and plan the actions which thrust Heathrow and Kingsnorth into the public eye. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorthclimatecamp\">Climate camp</a> is a tribute to the anarchist politics that Jasiewicz supports. </p> <p>But in seeking to extrapolate from this experience to a wider social plan, she makes two grave errors. The first is to confuse ends and means. She claims to want to stop global warming, but she makes that task 100 times harder by rejecting all state and corporate solutions. It seems to me that what she really wants to do is to create an anarchist utopia, and to use climate change as an excuse to engineer it. </p> <p>Stopping runaway climate change must take precedence over every other aim. Everyone in this movement knows that there is very little time: the window of opportunity in which we can prevent two degrees of warming is closing fast. We have to use all the resources we can lay hands on, and these must include both governments and corporations. Or perhaps she intends to build the installations required to turn the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/16/energy.householdbills\">energy economy</a> around \u2013 wind farms, wave machines, solar thermal plants in the Sahara, new grid connections and public transport systems \u2013 herself? </p> <p>Her article is a terrifying example of the ability some people have to put politics first and facts second when confronting the greatest challenge humanity now faces. The facts are as follows. Runaway climate change is bearing down on us fast. We require a massive political and economic response to prevent it. Governments and corporations, whether we like it or not, currently control both money and power. Unless we manage to mobilise them, we stand a snowball's chance in climate hell of stopping the collapse of the biosphere. Jasiewicz would ignore all these inconvenient truths because they conflict with her politics. </p> <p>\"Changing our sources of energy without changing our sources of economic and political power\", she asserts, \"will not make a difference. Neither coal nor nuclear are the 'solution', we need a revolution.\" So before we are allowed to begin cutting greenhouse gas emissions, we must first overthrow all governments and corporations and replace them with autonomous communities of happy campers. All this must take place within a couple of months, as there is so little time in which we could prevent two degrees of warming. This is magical thinking of the most desperate kind. If I were an executive of E.ON or Exxon, I would be delighted by this political posturing, as it provides a marvellous distraction from our real aims. </p> <p>To support her argument, Jasiewicz misrepresents what I said at climate camp. She claims that I \"confessed not knowing where to turn next to solve the issues of how to generate the changes necessary to shift our sources of energy, production and consumption\". I confessed nothing of the kind. In my book Heat, I spell out what is required to bring about a 90% cut in emissions by 2030. Instead I confessed that I don't know how to solve the problem of capitalism without resorting to totalitarianism. </p> <p>The issue is that capitalism involves lending money at interest. If you lend at 5%, then one of two things must happen. Either the money supply must increase by 5%, or the velocity of circulation must increase by 5%. In either case, if this growth is not met by a concomitant increase in the supply of goods and services, it becomes inflationary and the system collapses. But a perpetual increase in the supply of goods and services will eventually destroy the biosphere. So how do we stall this process? Even when usurers were put to death and condemned to perpetual damnation, the practice couldn't be stamped out. Only the communist states managed it, through the extreme use of the state control Jasiewicz professes to hate. I don't yet have an answer to this conundrum. Does she? </p> <p>Yes, let us fight both corporate power and the undemocratic tendencies of the state. Yes, let us try to crack the problem of capitalism and then fight for a different system. But let us not confuse this task with the immediate need to stop two degrees of warming, or allow it to interfere with the carbon cuts that have to begin now. </p> <p>Jasiewicz's second grave error is to imagine that society could be turned into a giant climate camp. Anarchism is a great means of organising a self-elected community of like-minded people. It is a disastrous means of organising a planet. Most anarchists envisage their system as the means by which the oppressed can free themselves from persecution. But if everyone is to be free from the coercive power of the state, this must apply to the oppressors as well as the oppressed. The richest and most powerful communities on earth \u2013 be they geographical communities or communities of interest \u2013 will be as unrestrained by external forces as the poorest and weakest. As a friend of mine put it, \"when the anarchist utopia arrives, the first thing that will happen is that every Daily Mail reader in the country will pick up a gun and go and kill the nearest hippy\".</p> <p>This is why, though both sides furiously deny it, the outcome of both market fundamentalism and anarchism, if applied universally, is identical. The anarchists' associate with the oppressed, the market fundamentalists with the oppressors. But by eliminating the state, both remove such restraints as prevent the strong from crushing the weak. Ours is not a choice between government and no government. It is a choice between government and the mafia.</p> <p>Over the past year I have been working with groups of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/11/kingsnorthclimatecamp.activists\">climate protesters</a> who have changed my view of what could be achieved. Most of them are under 30, and they bring to this issue a clear-headedness and pragmatism that I have never encountered in direct action movements before. They are prepared to take <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/climatechange.police\">extraordinary risks</a> to try to defend the biosphere from the corporations, governments and social trends which threaten to make it uninhabitable. They do so for one reason only: that they love the world and fear for its future. It would be a tragedy if, through the efforts of people like Jasiewicz, they were to be diverted from this urgent task into the identity politics that have wrecked so many movements.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC faces the prospect of strike action next week at its research and development centre in Kingswood Warren, Surrey. </p> <p>Staff claim that years of inconsistent decisions about the future of the site are putting its unique and world-class reputation for technological research at risk.</p> <p>At a ballot this week, Bectu union members voted in favour of strike action on August 29 and said they questioned the integrity of the decision to close the historic Kingswood Warren.</p> <p>The listed building, which is set in several acres of parkland and has been home to the BBC R&amp;D department for 60 years, has been sold to a residential developer and staff will leave the site this autumn.</p> <p>Bectu has been negotiating with BBC management to secure guarantees about the future of the department and the facilities at its new location at White City, and has also been trying to ensure fair treatment of R&amp;D staff - many of whom have worked at Kingswood Warren for decades.</p> <p>Staff argue that the White City plans will not match the facilities and technical infrastructure of Kingswood Warren, potentially hampering the department's research work. </p> <p>Bectu members question whether their new accommodation will provide the quality laboratory space or the environment required to develop next generation technologies. </p> <p>\"Kingswood doesn't just have high capacity internet links, an anechoic chamber and the facility to build prototype equipment quickly and cheaply,\" said Bectu national official Anna Murray.</p> <p>\"The base is an academic community which nurtures new ideas and solutions. Our members fear that relocation signals the beginning of the end for world-class BBC research.\"</p> <p>Murray said staff did not want to \"withdraw from the work they love\" but are frustrated by management's \"refusal to demonstrate that their plans are workable\".</p> <p>Bectu says that many staff will face a new and expensive commute into London following a below-inflation pay deal. </p> <p>They are not eligible for redundancy because, under BBC policy, the move is less than 30 miles away - though some staff face a second move to the BBC's new base in Salford in the north-west of England by 2012.</p> <p>Kingswood's engineers have contributed, among other things, to the development of Nicam Digital Stereo, colour television, digital terrestrial innovation Freeview, FreeSat and the iPlayer.</p> <p>A BBC spokeswoman said: \"The BBC is disappointed by the decision by a small number of Bectu members to take industrial action. </p> <p>\"The BBC believes its plans to relocate the research and innovation department are in the best interests of the future media and technology team and in the best interests of the licence fee payer. </p> <p>\"We understand the concerns of the staff affected and we are working with them and with the unions to address those concerns.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>As the country <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/08/bayhs-drive-by.html\">holds its breath</a> and waits for Barack Obama's vice-presidential choice to emerge, it's worth taking a look at the running mate John McCain is <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/politico/20080819/pl_politico/12619\\\">planning to introduce</a> a week from today.</p> <p>A major aspect of McCain's appeal to independent voters -- the types political analysts call \"swing\" voters -- is his stated commitment to fighting climate change. No less an arbiter than <a href=\"http://gulliverswift.newsvine.com/_news/2008/08/19/1763043-nyt-bill-clinton-praises-john-mccains-energy-policy\">Bill Clinton recently said</a> that no matter who is elected president this year, reducing carbon emissions will vault to the top of the agenda.</p> <p>But McCain may send a very mixed message next week by choosing a vice-president who is, shall we say, less than convinced about the merits of mandatory greenhouse gas reduction. Where do his hopefuls stand on the issue?...</p> <p><strong>Mitt Romney:</strong> He has become the front-runner in the VP speculation game, but just seven months ago Romney was slamming <a href=\"http://www.pewclimate.org/policy_center/analyses/s_139_summary.cfm\">McCain's climate change bill</a> as a \"<a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/DEC_2008\">job killer</a>\" that would \"make it harder for families to make their ends meet\". The former Massachusetts governor was also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAGpLOKtQDA\">filmed earlier this year</a> saying a cap-and-trade carbon reduction scheme is \"one of the possible solutions\" but that he would only pursue it \"with other nations involved\".</p> <p><strong>Tim Pawlenty:</strong> This Minnesota governor, reportedly high on McCain's short list, is one potential running mate who might keep the Republican honest on climate change. He established a <a href=\"http://www.governor.state.mn.us/mediacenter/pressreleases/PROD008606.html\">regional cap-and-trade system</a> with fellow mid-westerners this year and backs state carbon reduction targets that are even steeper than McCain has proposed for the entire US. But <a href=\"http://www.minnpost.com/ronway/2008/02/21/958/critics_wonder_what_happened_to_pawlentys_push_to_reduce_emissions\">critics have grumbled</a> about Pawlenty's slow follow-through on the recommendations of his own climate change advisers.</p> <p><strong>Joe Lieberman:</strong> This dark-horse choice for McCain's No 2 was his co-sponsor on a major climate change reduction bill in 2005, making him a natural ally on the issue.</p> <p><strong>Tom Ridge:</strong> He is another long-shot candidate thanks to his support for abortion rights, but this former homeland security secretary has revealed little in recent years about his stance on climate change. In 2000, while governor of Pennsylvania, he <a href=\"http://ontheissues.org/Governor/Tom_Ridge_Energy_+_Oil.htm\">signed onto a platform</a> that called for \"voluntary\", not mandatory, carbon reductions and insisted on a global climate change treaty would only work if every country agreed to reductions.</p>",
  "<p>As an Iranian woman and mother, I was absolutely gutted when I heard about the fact that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/21/iran.religion\">Golshifteh Farahani</a> had been stopped from leaving Iran. Farahani, 25, is a popular actress who has, in her already distinguished career, managed to capture the heart of her nation. <br> Although the full reasons behind the ban have not become public, the reaction inside Iran to this news \u2013 spread through informal channels \u2013 has been shock and disappointment. When I spoke to Mona, a 22-year-old university student in Tehran, she told me: </p> <blockquote> <p>This news has spread very quickly within the student community and Iranian internet chatrooms, but as it has not been much broadcast in the national press, a lot of what we hear is merely speculation. There has been a tremendous amount of support and sympathy towards Golshifteh's problem. This is typical behaviour towards a well-recognised and successful woman in Iran. We are disappointed that there hasn't been a shift in attitudes towards women in recent years.</p> </blockquote> <p>We can only imagine what must have gone through Farahani's mind as she went thought the gates of the new Imam Khomeini Airport in the outskirts of Tehran. She must have been full of hope and excitement at the prospect of this new stage of her acting career in Hollywood. Iranian women have always played an important role in Iran 's art, music and entertainment world. Farahani was on her way to the US to discuss future film roles when she was informed that she was unable to leave the country due to a problem with the permit which was supposed to allow her to do further work abroad. It has been reported that she was with other actors at the airport when she was given the devastating news.<br> Although one of the conditions in the contract for her most recent (and as yet unreleased) film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758774/\">Body of Lies</a> was to observe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab\">hijab</a>, I am sure the movie director must have made sure her role in the film wouldn't jeopardise her career or life in Iran in any shape or form. \"Body of lies\" tells the story of a CIA agent (Leonardo DiCaprio) sent to Jordan to track down an al-Qaida leader. Farahani's appearance in the film is the first by an actress living in Iran in a Hollywood movie. <br> The current turn of events is bad news not only for Farahani, but for others in the entertainment industry in Iran. In one of her <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/arts/story/2008/08/080820_an-aa-golshifte.shtml\">recent interviews</a> in Iran, she complained about the lack of encouragement and opportunities for the young people in Iran. She was concerned about their future and mentioned her own brother who plays rock music but is unable to organise a concert due to restrictions.</p> <p>As an Iranian who has experienced the excessive and unfortunate social restrictions imposed on women, I sincerely hope the airport incident is nothing more than a technical glitch in her agreement with the vezarat-e ershad (ministry of culture and Islamic guidance). This department was founded following the Islamic revolution through the integration of the ministries of culture and art and information and tourism. Hopefully, authorities there will allow her to continue with her journey to secure more acting roles in the US and elsewhere. In one sense, of course, the whole incident has been brilliant publicity for the movie. But we can only hope all obstacles are removed so that this Iranian artist can be free to pursue a global career. Iran at present is lacking role models like Farahani and it would be a great shame if this incident discouraged other young professionals from exploring opportunities outside of Iran. </p> <p>I would urge the verzarat-e ershad to consider the positive side of this gifted actress playing a role in a Hollywood film. It would show the US public that ordinary Iranians have respect and admiration for US films. It would also project an open-mindedness on the part of the ministry toward Iran-US cooperation in the creative and performing arts. Surely it is difficult enough to create a film and to develop a talent to the point where an actor is invited to take a role in another country, without governments throwing obstacles into the paths of such ventures?</p>",
  "<p>University College London has overtaken its rival Imperial in the most highly rated world rankings of universities.</p> <p>UCL climbed three places to 22nd in the annual international rankings published last week by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China.</p> <p>In a statement UCL said the Shanghai Jiao Tong University's latest annual academic rankings of world universities indicates that UCL's place among the world's leading universities \"has risen again\".</p> <p>UCL president and provost professor Malcolm Grant said: \"These new rankings confirm UCL's strengths \u2013 and steady improvement - on the global stage. We know that the UCL community conducts excellent research and teaching, but it is their commitment to applying that excellence to the world's major problems that make us London's global university.\"</p> <p>Imperial dropped from 23 last year to 27th in the 2008 tables.</p> <p>The tables are dominated by the US universities, with Harvard ranked top in the world, but UK universities continue to be among the best, with five institutions, including UCL and the universities of Manchester and Bristol, improving their international positions on last year.</p> <p>The UK has 11 universities in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2008/aug/22/internationaleducationnews.highereducation1\">world's top 100</a> - the second highest number after the US with 54. The universities of Cambridge and Oxford have maintained their 2007 positions of fourth and tenth in the world respectively.</p> <p>The universities of Manchester and Bristol improved on their 2007 standing, climbing eight places to 40th and one place to 61st respectively. Kings College London rose two places to 81st in the world and Birmingham university climbed one place to 91st.</p> <p>Four UK universities slipped down the league table, most notably Imperial.</p> <p>Sheffield University dropped the most, falling five places to 77th in the world, while Edinburgh University slipped two places to 55th and Nottingham University fell to 82nd in the world from 81st last year.</p> <p>The figures show that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2008/aug/22/internationaleducationnews.highereducation\">UK universities</a> continue to punch above their weight compared to the performance of institutions in other countries.</p> <p>For example, Germany invests around 6% of its gross domestic product in its universities, compared with the UK which invests 4.9%. But only six German institutions are among the top 100 compared to 11 from the UK.</p> <p>Seventeen of the top 20 institutions are from the US. The universities of Harvard, Stanford, and California, Berkeley maintained their 2007 first, second and third places in the league table respectively.</p>",
  "<p>The British government will lose its leadership position on climate change and risk scuppering a global deal to cut emissions if it presses ahead with a new generation of dirty coal power, say leading US scientists and environmental leaders.</p> <p>The heads of three influential groups, representing more than 2 million members, have written to the foreign secretary, David Miliband, warning that the UK proposals for up to eight new coal plants threatens the chance of the US joining a post-Kyoto international agreement to be agreed in 2009.</p> <p>It is the first public sign of growing international anger over the plans and will add to pressure on Miliband and the environment secretary, Hilary Benn, to oppose the government's new coal policy in cabinet. Most immediate is the decision on whether to approve the first major planning application for a new coal plant at Kingsnorth in Kent, the site of this month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorthclimatecamp\">Climate Camp protest</a>.</p> <p>In the UK, there has already been heavy criticism of the plans to build new coal plants, without technology to capture and bury the large volumes of carbon dioxide emitted. Lord Smith, the new head of the government's Environment Agency, recently added forcefully to condemnations by the Environmental Audit Committee, the Royal Society, City investment groups, the government's environmental advisor Jonathon Porritt, former chief scientist Professor Sir David King, and the Institute for Public Policy Research think-tank. </p> <p>The letter, now revealed to the Guardian, is signed by the heads of the <a href=\" http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/08/15/Milibandletter.pdf\">Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Natural Resources Defense Council</a>. It argues Britain is in a particularly important position because of \"your government's historic commitment to lead on global warming in Europe and around the world.\"</p> <p>It adds: \"As proposed, these conventional coal plants lack any limits on their emissions of carbon dioxide and would drastically increase the UK's carbon dioxide emissions and make achievement of your stated pollution reduction goals extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible. Building new conventional plants and setting the UK up to fail and lose its leadership mantle will make our work in the US all the more difficult.\"</p> <p>Tim Jones, climate policy officer for the World Development Movement anti-poverty campaign group, said the concern was shared across the developing world, especially where emerging environment campaigns are arguing for much poorer nations to cut emissions, and rich countries like the UK are being blamed for changes such as typhoons, drought and rising sea levels. </p> <p>\"They can adapt to one to two degrees of warming, but if it's more than that they can't adapt; they are just filled with despair,\" said Jones.</p> <p>British officials and ministers are understood to have already been challenged over plans for unabated coal power by other governments.</p> <p>The US intervention - signed by Carl Pope, the Sierra Club's executive director, Kevin Knobloch, the UCS president, and Frances G Beinecke, the NRDC director \u2013 follows an unprecedented campaign against new coal power in the US which has led to 66 of a proposed 150 new plants being abandoned or rejected by politicians and the courts, and most of the remainder locked in legal battles.</p> <p>But although the two main candidates for the US presidential election in November, John McCain and Barack Obama, have both declared their support for international emissions cuts, campaigners warn that any deal would also have to be approved by Congress, which would need to know there was public support for such a move, particularly during a recession.</p> <p>'If the UK takes a firm stand and rejects conventional coal it will send a strong, clear message to our new President and a new Congress, as well as to other countries considering new coal plants,' the letter adds. </p> <p>Replying for the British government, the energy minister at DBERR, Malcolm Wicks, said \"as a 'live' planning case I cannot comment on the merits or otherwise\u2026or on the timing of any decision\". </p> <p>In a Guardian interview earlier this month, Wicks widened the government's argument in favour of coal, saying that new power stations were not just essential for energy security but also to allow the development of carbon capture and storage technology. Without that technology, \"all is lost on global warming\", he said, because of China's reliance on the fuel. \"The idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in Britain say no to coal and China will say 'OK we will follow' is just daft,\" he said. Green campaigners reject the idea that CCS cannot be developed without new, unabated power stations.</p> <p>A recent report by the IPPR said the European Union's goal of reducing emissions from the power sector and heavy industry through its emissions trading scheme would collapse if the go-ahead were given to seven new coal plants in the UK and up to 75 across Europe.</p>",
  "<p>Who would think about cricket on a day when the most awe-inspiring physique that sport has seen since Jonah Lomu made his competitors look as immobile as Lot's wife on his way to sprint immortality? Why bother about a game in coloured clothes when India had ensured a multiple-medal haul at an Olympics for the first time since 1952? Excitement over 27 runs from 57 balls? Get a life.</p> <p>Every four years, when India's sporting inadequacies are laid bare for the planet to see, it becomes fashionable to trash cricket, to lay all the blame for athletic and administrative ineptitude at the door of the only sport that hasn't been sold down the river by buffoons with political connections. Cricket's grip on the country is all pervasive, we're told. It's the giant banyan tree under whose shadow no other sport can thrive. It takes away all the sponsorship money and endorsement deals, leaving the rest to run around with begging bowls.</p> <p>\"My blood boils when everybody goes gaga over cricket,\" <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7482661.stm\">said Vijender Kumar</a>, the Bhiwani boxer whose brave quest for middleweight gold ended at Cuban hands on Friday afternoon. It's a sentiment that has been picked up on by millions, including the bandwagon-jumpers who don't even care about sport. Those who wouldn't know an air rifle from a popgun are suddenly experts when it comes to what ails Indian sport. Cricket.</p> <p>Never mind that the cricketers actually reached a World Cup final in 2003, something their hockey counterparts haven't even come close to since 1975. Forget the fact that the footballers finally qualified for the Asian Cup for the first time since Platini's summer of '84. Ignore too that the athletes are nowhere close to the standards achieved by Milkha Singh and PT Usha, dominant at Asian level and as close as India have ever come to world-class.</p> <p>Let's blame everything on cricket, the one sport that allows Indian sports fans to hold their heads up high from time to time. The lack of proportion extends to the fans as well, with a deluded minority considering the team better than Australia after one win, and then throwing animated objects at them on websites when they lose.</p> <p>It doesn't help that Indian cricket's golden age is over. In the mid-1970s, the hockey players couldn't deal with the transition to Astroturf and the game in India lost its soul. Now, with India's greatest bowler and the finest middle order that Asia has ever seen preparing for retired life, Indian cricket must begin its process of renewal.</p> <p>On Wednesday, we saw a glimpse of its future, and it was a welcome one. This isn't a Mystic Meg column, but <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/02/11/badrinaths_talent_goes_wasted.html\">as it pointed out in February</a>, it was obvious to all but the very daft that Subramaniam Badrinath was the answer to India's middle-order prayers. Only the infinitely wise selectors can tell you how a succession of non-entities - Rohit Sharma being the lone exception - jumped past him in the queue.</p> <p>One innings doesn't a career make, but often it can reveal a depth of character that convinces even the hardened cynic. In January of 2003, a fairly meaningless VB Series encounter at the Adelaide Oval saw Australia give a first cap to 21-year-old Michael John Clarke. England stuggled to 152, but after a 90-ball crawl to 30 from Michael Bevan, Australia lost four wickets for eight to slump to 104 for six. On a pitch that had reduced gifted stroke players to plodders, Clarke stroked an assured 39 from 47 balls, leading the side home in the 48th over. He would play no part in the subsequent World Cup, and would have to wait more than 18 months - and an injury to Ricky Ponting - for his first baggy green, an opportunity he grasped with a glorious 151 at Bangalore's Chinnaswamy Stadium.</p> <p>Badrinath wasn't even in India's one-day squad until Sachin Tendulkar hurt his elbow in the final Test less than a fortnight ago. And but for Virender Sehwag's ankle injury and Gautam Gambhir suffering from a stiff neck, he certainly would have played no part in Wednesday's game. He turns 28 in just over a week's time, and when he arrived at the crease with India quaking at 75 for five, it's safe to say that the pressure was immense.</p> <p>Mahela Jayawardene had the scent of the kill in his nostrils, and Ajantha Mendis and Muttiah Muralitharan were soon wheeling away in tandem. Badrinath, who was Murali's team-mate in the IPL, played them with the poise of one who had been doing it for years. He worked Murali through the leg side with a wristy flourish and cut him impossibly late on a couple of occasions. Mendis's variations were met with the straightest of bats. Unlike some of his more illustrious compatriots, he didn't get sucked into pad play, and his solidity at one end allowed MS Dhoni to whittle away at the target from the other.</p> <p>Even after Dhoni departed with victory in sight, Badrinath stayed around to make absolutely sure, clinching the game with a neat drive to extra-cover. As with Clarke, his technique had been impressive. His temperament and focus were even more eye-catching, and it'll be a brave selector who tries to pitchfork a callow youth into the Test team at the expense of one whose game appears far more complete.</p> <p>Rahul Dravid, who played a couple of Deodhar Trophy games alongside him, reckons that Badrinath has what it takes to eventually become a fixture at No4 or 5. \"He seems very organised technically,\" he said, \"and more importantly, he has the right mentality.\"</p> <p>Once the quadrennial Olympic fever subsides and Australia arrive in town in October, there's likely to be less cribbing about India's national sport. And as India start to build for the future, Badrinath, the team's Johnny Come Lately, could become one of the most important bricks of all.</p>",

  "<p>Weak and almost certain to get weaker. That's the only conclusion that can be drawn from today's figures showing that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/22/economicgrowth.economics\">UK economy came to a halt in the second quarter of this year</a>. </p> <p>There was nothing in the data released by the Office for National Statistics to suggest anything other than a long hard winter ahead, in which Britain will have its first recession in more than a decade and a half.</p> <p>The first reason for concern is that the flat picture for growth between April and June is a bit of a mirage. Growth is made up of a number of components - household spending, government spending, investment, inventories and net trade - and in the second quarter households spent less and investment fell heavily.</p> <p>Government spending gave a boost to the economy but had it not been for a rise in inventories - unsold goods that companies have stockpiled - GDP would have fallen by 0.6% on the quarter. There is a risk that firms will run these stocks down over the coming months rather than producing new goods.</p> <p>Trade also added to growth, but only because there was a bigger fall in imports than there was in exports. With the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globaleconomy\">global economy</a> struggling, it would appear that even with a weaker pound the UK is not going to be able to trade its way out of trouble.</p> <p>That leads to a second point. Ever since the start of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> a year ago, the government has been banging on about how well placed Britain is to weather the storm. Nothing could be further from the truth, since the deceptively strong performance of the economy over the past decade was the result of bubbles in two specific sectors - financial services and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/housingmarket\">housing</a>. Both have now burst, and there is nothing to fall back on. In the latest quarter, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/construction\">construction</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/manufacturing\">manufacturing</a> contracted, the service sector grew by just 0.2%.</p> <p>Finally, there's the stance of policy. While it is clear that consumers are tightening their belts in response to a squeeze on real incomes, the Bank of England is concerned about cutting interest rates while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">inflation is running at more than double its 2% target</a> and on course to hit 5% over the coming months. </p> <p>The long lags in monetary policy mean that it would probably be too late to avoid the two quarters of negative growth that constitute a technical recession even if the Bank moved aggressively now. The fact that policy easing is likely to be delayed means that growth in 2008 as a whole will be barely 1% and 2009 will be even lower than that. </p> <p>Not good news for a government 20 points behind in the polls and facing an election in less than two years.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Hello</strong></p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Rob will be here from 1.30pm or so.</strong></p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Afternoon, yeah?</strong> I've never been much of a fan of having the one-day series after the Tests \u2013 you wouldn't have your pressed foie gras with Sauternes and camomile reduction, pickled garlic, grilled focaccia after your line caught turbot fillet studded with Perigord truffle, boulang\u00e8re potatoes, leek ballottine and civet sauce, would you now \u2013 but the very reason the system is so flawed should work in England's favour for this series.</p> <p>As Duncan Fletcher pointed out <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/20/newlook_england_can_scoop_odi.html\">the other day</a>, invariably the team that ends the Tests with an actual or moral victory struggle in the subsequent one-dayers, because of inherent difficulties such AS THE RANK LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM THAT PRECLUDES THEM FROM RAISING THEIR GAME ALL THE TIME.</p> <p>So that psychological quirk might level things up a bit, because there's no doubt South Africa (2nd in the world) are a better side than England (7th). It's a really big series for England, and especially their coach Peter McClaren. He's no bigamist, of that we're sure, but he has had a lot of honeymoons lately. The first came when he took the job; the second when England symbolically started a new era by axing Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard in New Zealand; and the third when Kevin Pietersen took over as captain.</p> <p>All of this has meant that Moores has, so far, got away with a pretty modest record. But it's three honeymoons and you're out in this game and, as Lawrence Booth pointed out in <a href=\"http://sport.theguardian.com/thespin/0,,806133,00.html \">The Spin</a>, this might be a career-defining fortnight.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Team news</strong> There are all manner of changes from the last (serious) ODI, against New Zealand at Lord's in June. Kevin Pietersen drops to the more sensible position of No4. Owais Shah leaps to No3 and Matt Prior gets another chance to show that he has the savvy to open the batting in one-day cricket. (A little clue that would save us all a lot of time: he doesn't.) Samit Patel stays in the team after making his debut against Scotland the other day.</p> <p>South Africa, who are without both Morkel brothers, have a few one-day specialists, the most exciting of which is surely the obscenely gifted Herschelle Gibbs. Watch out, too, for JP Duminy, a young batsman with serious flair.</p> <p>I don't mind the look of this England team: there is real depth in the batting and some big-hitters in the bowling. <a href=\"http://www.thewisdencricketer.com/blog/?p=144\">This</a> would be my team, but it's not much different. And the return of Stephen Harmison gives England the intriguing option of Harmison and Flintoff as first- and second-change, which was devastatingly effective against in Australia in 2005. That said, I think that, with another pitch-hitter in Broad in this side, Harmison will probably take the new ball today. I'd be very tempted to try Flintoff at the start of the innings, but they seem averse to it.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>England</strong> Bell, Prior, Shah, Pietersen, Flintoff, Bopara, Patel, Wright, Broad, Harmison, Anderson.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Stattage</strong> Of the last 12 completed ODIs at Headingley, going back to 1990, 11 have been won by the team batting second. That said, none were day-nighters, so the significant advantage of batting second (ie bowling at Headingley before midday) isn't there. So, basically the last 59 words you've just read have been a complete waste of your time. Sixty-two words now.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Is it socially acceptable to link to your own work?</strong> <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/22/the_joy_of_six_england_v_south_1.html\">It is now</a></p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Proving just how little that stat meant</strong> Kevin Pietersen has won the toss and England will bat first.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> Smith, Gibbs, Kallis, de Villiers, Duminy, Boucher, Philander, Botha, Nel, Steyn, Ntini.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>Riffwatch</strong> Given the <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/organgrinder/2008/08/bbc_radio_4s_test_match_specia_1.html\"> spectacular mid-life crisis that Test Match Special is currently undergoing</a>, why not nominate your alternative yoof/laddish/2k9 presenters for next year's Ashes. Lee Calvert has suggested Dick &amp; Dom In Da TMS Box, which is a good start. </p> <p>Fearne Cotton and Holly Willoughby would give good ball-by-ball, I reckon, and they could kill two birds (it's not sexist \u2013 I'm not calling them birds) with one stone by popping into the crowd to do some matchmaking.</p> <p>Failing that, I reckon those peerless nuggets Bex and Luke from Big Brother should get a go. Their sub-Carry On innuendo (which is quite an achievement, when you think about it) would be something to behold: \"He's wielding his stick Bex; there's a man wielding his stick in public!\" At which point she would steam onto the field with her top whipped up, inducing a collective coronary among the members.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>\"Robster</strong>,\" begins Jeremy Theobald. \"Would you mind wishing Lynn Bashforth a happy birthday on the OBO today? I won't mention her age but we do seem to be in the pensioners/disabled area at Headingley this afternoon.\" Isn't that more to do with you than her, old boy?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 7-0 (Bell 3, Prior 4)</strong> Okay. It's the fit-again Dale Steyn to open the bowling in encouragingly clammy conditions. He gets some early shape, but Bell leans across and works him classily through midwicket for three. This is surely the best position for Bell in this side. Prior then very nearly goes first ball: he was squared up by a good delivery and edged it <em>right between</em> first and second slip, who were both sat scratching their backsides and looking pleased with themselves. It was closer to Kallis at second slip, but he just watched it go to the boundary.</p> <p>\"A new motorway has opened up recently - that's it\" honks Mikey Holding. \"Seven-nil yeah?\" asks Scott Murray as he walks past, showing the instinctive understanding of the game so evident in his OBOs back in the day.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 12-0 (Bell 4, Prior 8)</strong> Makhaya Ntini, who as David Lloyd points out has gone for over 60 in his last three ODIs, tempts Bell into fresh-airing a windy woof well wide of off stump from his first delivery. Later in the over Prior laces a quite superb cover-drive for four.</p> <p>This is such a big series for Prior, who in 21-odd ODIs opening has made only one fifty, and has shown an adolescent level of shot-selection. I'd go for Mustard but, having picked Prior, I hope they give him at least this series and the winter's ODIs to adapt to the role at international level. If he's still failing then, fine, have him shot and bring Mustard in.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 17-0 (Bell 5, Prior 10)</strong> Steyn gets too much swing as is wided twice as a result. Prior then screws a slightly leaden-footed drive behind point for two. Early impressions are that it's a pretty decent pitch. </p> <p>\"Afternoon Rob,\" afternoons Andy Bradshaw. \"May I suggest a bet on how long Naylor takes to get an email in with the words \"Prior\" \"Balance\" \"Lack of\" \"for\" \"top\" \"level\" \"cricketer\". I'm going for three overs.\" As ever, Naylor wins.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 24-0 (Bell 11, Prior 10)</strong> Bell pulls Ntini for two off the front foot; as Holding points out, it reflects the lack of pace in this pitch. Then he rolls his wrists to get three more through square leg. There is talk of Bell being the man to bat through the overs for 115 not out, but that's a bit early-90s, no? Besides, Bell is better than that.</p> <p>\"Charlie Brooker would be brilliant for TMS,\" says Tom Paternoster, \"but only if he was commentating on the commentators during the drinks break. He could tear Boycott a new one every time he brought out his stick of rhubarb. Unfortunately, Charlie's got a face like [\"eulogy\" deleted] so, despite it being radio, they'll probably go for George Lamb and his gang of sycophantic morons.\" I'm sure George Lamb is a good fellow. I'm sure he loves his Ma, furnishes the odd beggar with silver and that. And I do like his beard. But my god if ever there was a living case for a mute button.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 27-0 (Bell 11, Prior 14)</strong> Steyn is drawn towards the pads, looking for some killer late swing, but it doesn't work and Prior tucks it crisply behind square for four. Good shot. The next shot is an utter disgrace. He tried to pull an 88mph half-tracker, but it was on him too quickly, even on this pitch, and he choked it gently back over the bowler's head and safe. Utter filth, mind.</p> <p>In other news, here's the latest of Dileep Premachandran's <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/22/badrinath_can_cure_middleorder.html\">excellent blogs</a> on the state of Indian cricket.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 29-0 (Bell 12, Prior 14)</strong> It's all pretty agreeable from England so far, with nothing to moan about: that's no way to spend an OBO. Prior has played some nice strokes, especially that searing cover-drive, and Bell is snugly inside his bubble. It's not quite in the realms of man-love, but I so, so want Ian Bell to succeed. </p> <p>\"I always thought Brian Blessed was a missed opportunity on TMS,\" saying Andy Bradshaw, \"especially when on the sub continent and the phone lines had gone down.\" The day's first genuine LOL!</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 34-0 (Bell 11, Prior 18)</strong> Blistering stuff from Prior, who leans into a wide, swinging delivery from Steyn and howitzes it over cover for four. After going over the boundary, the ball drops into the camera pit and gets a good soaking; as a consequence, it's changed. South Africa will hope the new ball swings from straight and not just from wide of off stump.</p> <p>\"Steve McClaren is a shoo-in as a soon-to-be TMS presenter,\" says Andrew Banks. \"He fills all the requirements \u2013 experience on FiveLive, Little understanding of cricket, well any top-class sport, and he's known to the youth of today.\" You only put \"shoo-in\" because it sounds Dutcsh, didn't shoo?</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 37-0 (Bell 14, Prior 18)</strong> Ntini, going even wider on the crease than usual and delivering from around extra-cover, draws Bell into an almost fatal grope. Later in the over England take a stupid single to de Villiers, charging in from backward point, and one of them - either Bell or Prior, of that I'm sure - would have gone with a direct hit. Prior, in fact.</p> <p>\"Rob: I think it would be quite fun to have Hugh Porter and Phil Liggett in tandem (couldn't resist!) in the TMS box, with occasional contributions from Gary Herbert \u2013 who could scream 'The British are coming, the British are coming' every now and then,\" says Clare Davies, who may or may not have existed on a diet of nothing but cycling and Pro Plus-Plus for the last fortnight.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 42-0 (Bell 16 from 34 balls, Prior 22 from 20)</strong> Prior picks Steyn's slower ball and drives it very pleasantly down the ground for three. Then Bell pulls a short one <em>just</em> short of midwicket. England are being done for pace on the bouncer, which is strange as this is a pretty slow pitch. That said, he is, as Shaun Pollock points out, bowing down the hill.</p> <p>\"Alright Rob,\" says Tom Nicolson. Alright Tom Nicolson. \"What's the deal with Luke Wright batting so far down the order having been opener in recent matches?\" Well, the deal with Luke Wright batting so far down the order having been opener in recent matches is, basically, that they want him in the middle for either the first 10 overs or the last 10 overs. If England lose their fifth wicket in, say, the 46th wicket I think they'd promote Wright ahead of Patel.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 44-0 (Bell 18, Prior 22)</strong> This is just a bit too slow from Bell: 18 from 40 deliveries now. I really am not sold on this anchor role. Basically, with the exception of things that can't be copied, England should look to be Australia-lite: play the same way but just around 4% as well. And Australia don't have anchormen. They have punishers or strokeplayers (or both) all the way down the order, and with eight/nine batsmen in a team, surely that has to be the way forward. And it's not as if Bell can't do it, either. All things being equal, he should be looking for a strike-rate of around 80. So far, it's below 50.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 46-0 (Bell 19, Prior 23)</strong> Nel replaces Steyn, who bowled okay but couldn't get it to swing when he wanted it to swing, and Philander drops an unbelievable sitter. Prior clunked a drive straight to mid-off, with one hand coming off the bat, and Philander grassed the most straightforward catch imaginable. Nel has steam emerging from every orifice. </p> <p>\"Are you watching the game on Sky or are you at the game; or both?\" asks Dan Woodhouse. None of the above. I'm sat in my jim-jams at home watching Diagnosis Murder. This is just one of those avant-garde \"imaginings\" of how the game might have gone. In reality, in Yorkshire, England are 12 for nine, all nine to Quinton Fortune.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 48-0 (Bell 20, Prior 24)</strong> Ntini gets one to lift savagely from a length past the outside edge of Bell, who recoils like a man who's just had some used grundies waved under his sniffer. England are in a bit of a rut now, possibly scared of the mistake they usually make when they open: getting out in the 20s and 30s.</p> <p>\"I'd suggest Daniel Radcliffe takes over at TMS,\" says Neill Brown. \"He's a cricket fan, so he'd know what he's talking about, plus there'd be endless opportunities for him to make \"witty\" plays on his Harry Potter past with his co-commentators. The kids would love him. And also, let's face it, after the Potter series ends he'll need the work.\"</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 51-0 (Bell 22, Prior 25)</strong> \"You can just tell right now that Prior doesn't fully understand his role,\" says Nasser, and he's bang on. Bell, meanwhile, rolls a couple off the pads to bring up a curate's egg of a fifty partnership.</p> <p>In other news, isn't Shaun Pollock a brilliant commentator? And, while we're at it, <em>isn't Schindler's List a brilliant film</em>?</p> <p>\"Riffing on members of an imaginary TMS Box is unlikely to match the eccentricities of Hoggy in real one right now,\" says Gary Naylor. \"I'd like to nominate the great Kenneth Williams for TMS. Given Kenny's notorious spikiness vis a vis Nicholas Parsons on Just a Minute, pairing him with Sir Geoffrey would do it for me.\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 56-0 (Bell 23, Prior 28)</strong> I'll be honest: Bell is starting to seriously get on my wick now. He's hit 23 from 52, without a boundary. He is so much better than this. It is also putting extra pressure on Prior, who makes room and slams Prior on the bounce to cover, and then works one to leg for two.</p> <p>Pollock and Nasser make a great commentary pair, because both are naturally inquisitive nerds. At the moment they're talking about the difference in opening the bowling against England in one-day cricket with and without Trescothick. I'd transcribe but, y'know.</p> <p>\"Surely TMS is screaming for Marcus Bentley, the voice of Big Brother?\" says Lee Calvert, and I'm glad he added that last bit because I was about to point out that it's <em>Da</em>Marcus, and Beasley rather than Bentley. \"'Ovah thorty-eayet, and the team mayats are talking aboot coming arownd the wicket. Team Captain Pietersen has left the field to go to the diary room, while Ian and Alastair are arguing ovah who is the best at short square-leg'.\" Sold. In fact, it might be the <em>best idea that anyone has ever come up with ever</em>.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 59-0 (Bell 24, Prior 29)</strong> Nel has an en<em>or</em>mous shout for LBW - seriously, it went on for about 10 seconds before the pain of rejection silenced him - against Bell. Bell had come miles across his stumps and was hit on the pad on off stump; Hawkeye had it clipping the top of off and middle. Later in the over yet another pull/hook is mistimed, with Prior bottom-edging it into his breadbasket. It's another good over for South Africa - only four boundaries in the first 15 overs now, and one of those fortuitous -and the walls are starting to close in. </p> <p>\"Surely we should start a 'Gary Naylor for TMS' campaign?\" save Dave Bell. \"This would have 2 advantages; 1) it would give mere mortals such as myself more chance of achieving fame by having an OBO missive printed, and 2) He baffles me a lot of the time, so he would have at least some chance of doing that to Boycott and keeping him quiet for a while. Everyone's a winner.\" Boycott and Naylor deserve a much greater stage than TMS. Prime Minister's Questions? Nuts TV?</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 62-0 (Bell 27, Prior 29)</strong> So we're into the final Powerplay, but England haven't scored a boundary since 1983, and there are none in that over, with Bell's tribute to Sunny Gavaskar's 1975 go-slow continuing. Sometimes this approach is justified - Mike Atherton took 29 balls to get off the work on a juicy Lord's track in the decisive ODI v West Indies in 1995, and he judged it beautifully, eventually getting a stunning century - but there's nothing in the pitch to suggest that this is such a situation.</p> <p>\"Noel Edmonds,\" offers Tom Oxley, mistaking this riff for 'Room 101 only they actually get clipped rather than shoved in an imaginary hole'. \"He's a creative genius, carries a wry and gentlemanly humour and has a beard. Furthermore Deal or No Deal is the best programme ever. Fact.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 65-0 (Bell 30, Prior 29)</strong> I don't always look forward to Beefy entering the box, but he could be on fire in view of today's events. Already he's off on one: \"plodding along\"; \"no idea how to use Powerplays\". Beefy is in the box with Nick Knight. Now that's a one-day opening partnership that would have been interesting. Three from that over, and it's drinks. Bell has 30 from 63 balls, Prior 29 from 39.</p> <p>\"Re: Tom Nicolson,\" begins George Thomson. \"What's the deal with Luke Wright being anywhere international cricket? Other than a marketable hairdo.\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 71-0 (Bell 34, Prior 31)</strong> Even when Bell gets a wide length delivery from the new bowler Kallis, he can only crash it straight to the man at short-extra. Beefy is ranting about Bell's strike-rate - \"not good enough for me\" - and, well, he's right. <em>England haven't hit a boundary for 11 Powerplay overs</em>.</p> <p>In other news, Ed Collington is a man after my own heart. \"TMS could do worse than <a href=\"http://www.struttergear.com/\">Mike Strutter</a>,\" he says. \"It'd be worth tuning in to hear him calling Prior a clumsy Mmtherf*&amp;^er everytime he put one down.\" I don't really think he'd use the word 'clumsy' now, do you?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 75-0 (Bell 34, Prior 35)</strong> THE FIRST BOUNDARY FOR 70 BALLS! Inevitably it didn't come from Bell; instead Prior charged Nel and heaved him high over mid-on. He didn't really get hold of it, and it dribbled apologetically to the fence, but they all count yeah? Those are the only runs from the over.</p> <p>\"What about 15 Peter 20?\" says Alex Netherton. \"He'd certainly introduce a golden new dynamic to commentary. Effluently similar to Pougatch.\" I actually don't mind Pougatch. And if anyone disses Vic Marks they're barred from this here OBO. Vic's soothing voice could quell a riot in Oz by the third syllable <em>at the latest</em>.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>THE CLOWN WALKS. WICKET: ENGLAND 77-1 (Bell c de Villiers b Kallis 35)</strong> The inevitable punchline to all that miserable faffing arrives when Bell, coming down the track to Kallis, slices a slower ball to backward point, where de Villiers takes a showy but still excellent two-handed catch above his head.</p> <p>That really is utter garbage from Bell: 35 from 69 boundaryless deliveries, taking up all bar three balls of the Powerplay overs. Once you promise as a one-day opener, you simply have to pay.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 78-1 (Prior 36, Shah 1)</strong> Shah, in his newish role at No3 (he batted there in a couple of ODIs back in the day, possibly in India in 2005-06), gets off the mark with a single. And that's the end of Powerplays, from which England accrued a risible five boundaries.</p> <p>\"Perhaps a Peep Show TMS special would be a runner,\" says Ian Copestake. \"One couldn't imagine Jez being at all interested though unless Super Hans offered him some speed to get him through it.\" Gog could be the Alison Mitchell-style pitchside rover, going round demanding that people go and get him a kebab.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 79-1 (Prior 36, Shah 1)</strong> Beefy and Knight are having a right-old tear-up in the commentary box. This is great stuff. Beefy is putting the boot in on Bell for getting one fifty in 21 innings; Knight is defending him, saying he's a class act and it's about defining roles. Shah, who I prefer at No6 to No3 for what it's worth, plays himself in against Nel in that over. Clare Davies, meanwhile, calls for Usain Bolt to be shoehorned into the team.</p> <p>\"It seems England can't win,\" says Martyn Kingsbury, who's got that straight. \"They have successfully played through the first 18 overs without losing a single wicket and still go at nigh on 4 an over and they still get ripped apart...\" Four an over stopped being acceptable 15 years ago. What would Australia be here? Say 130 for two maybe? And it's not like it's beyond Bell to play aggressively and pierce the field: he very frequently gets to a run-a-ball 30 in Test cricket before knuckling down.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 86-2 (Prior c de Villiers b Kallis 42)</strong> Gah! Matt Prior falls within sight of a fifty yet again. He had smoked Kallis majestically over long-on the previous ball, but the blood rushed to his head and he crashed the next ball straight to de Villiers at backward point. Still, 42 from 52 is a decent return to the side, especially as his opening partner was R Mortis.</p> <p>Just a thought, while we're here: how the hell does Kallis pick up so many wickets?</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 87-2 (Shah 2, Pietersen 1)</strong> The new batsman is Pietersen, who in his previous three one-day innings has failed to reach double figures.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 92-2 (Shah 4, Pietersen 4)</strong> The new bowler is Johan Botha, an off-spinner about whom I know little. This is why it's so important to have Pietersen no higher than No4 (and ideally at No5): he must be around in the middle overs to milk and manhandle these average spinners.</p> <p>It's a decent move by South Africa, too, because they will feel they can get away with two or three of Botha's overs while Pietersen plays himself in. Shah flap-sweeps a poor delivery to fine leg for two. Five from the over.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 96-2 (Shah 6, Pietersen 6)</strong> Not much happens in that Kallis over; Shah improvises nicely to take a single to third man.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 99-2 (Shah 8, Pietersen 7)</strong> Botha gets rid of another over for just three runs. England are struggling a wee bit here. </p> <p><a href=\"http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=balls_faced;qualmax1=0;qualmax2=0;qualmin1=0;qualmin2=0;qualval1=fours;qualval2=sixes;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\">Here</a>, by the way, is a list of the longest ODI innings without a boundary. I knew Kim Barnett was good at something apart from being bald.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 103-2 (Shah 9, Pietersen 10)</strong> Pietersen, on the walk to his nemesis Kallis, inside-edges a fraction short of Boucher, diving away to his left.</p> <p>Sam Collins is here. \"Prior's technique was so shoddy today. Can't keep his hand on the bat because his weight is all wrong. When are England going to learn how to bat in the first ten overs? It's not rocket science; bowlers hate bowling at batsmen who come at them, as Pollock said earlier. It's the continual lack of intent that is so galling.\"</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>27th over: England 106-2 (Shah 9, Pietersen 13)</strong> Whatever happened to the Pietersen slog-sweep? That's three overs out the way from Botha now, for only 11 runs, and I reckon it's time for these two, both devastating punishers of spin when they want to be, to go after him. There are risks involved, but of course there are bloody risks involved: this is one-day cricket.</p> <p>Here's a good email from Naylor. \"If we apply Mssrs Duckworth and Lewis' reasoning, ODI cricket is all about resources used and resources available. A huge advantage of having proper batsmen at 8 and 9 is that the batting resources are \"extended\" in terms of talent, but (obviously) not in terms of overs. This is why Australia keep attacking four even five down, knowing there's batting to come. England's slowness risks leaving batting resources unused (through batsmen left in the pavilion or proper batsmen arriving at the crease to slog immediately). This is the 21st century version of being bowled out with overs left.\" What he said. The last line is particularly true. At the start of this game the idea of a one-day anchorman mildly irritated me; now it's making me want to cleave everything that moves with the nearest golf club. It's so ridiculously antiquated.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 113-2 (Shah 12, Pietersen 16)</strong> Vernon Philander is the new bowler. They've just shown a replay of Nel when Philander dropped that sitter off his bowling earlier in the day. I think I may just have felt the first pangs of the man-love for Nel. Back in the real world, Shah tries to smear Philander from wide of off stump but only crunches it onto his pad and away for one. England have still hit only six boundaries all innings.</p> <p>\"Blimey!\" says Ken Nettleship, possibly upon realising that his surname is actually 'Nettleship'. \"Kim Barnett must have been knackered after that knock though. Mark Dekker, Zim, looked impressive with 22 scored off 18 overs worth of bowling, he must have been calling 'no' as the bowler was still in his run up.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 113-3 (Shah c Philander b Botha 12)</strong> Oh christ. Shah does finally go at Botha, but only skies a sweep high to deep backward square, where the butterfingered Philander makes an entirely straightforward catch look like something out of the Krypton Factor, eventually taking it at the second attempt after it went through his hands and hit him in the chest.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 115-3 (Pietersen 17, Flintoff 1)</strong> The oldest member of the team, Freddie Flintoff, is the new batsman. He's done his best work in ODIs at No5, most notably in 2004, but don't expect fireworks straight away: he likes a good 15-20 balls to play himself in.</p> <p>\"That list of innings without boundaries is palpably false,\" says Gary Naylor. \"David Boon is listed as making 64 off 98 balls running them all! He'd have expired.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 117-3 (Pietersen 18, Flintoff 2)</strong> Two from Philander's over, in which Flintoff is beaten by a lolloping slower ball that bounced twice on its way through to Boucher. In England's defence, this is a slowish pitch, but nonetheless it is criminal to have only scored six boundaries in 30 overs. Realistically they need at least 220 to have anything resembling a chance, but par is probably somewhere nearer 262.44.</p> <p>\"If England are going to insist on a one-day anchorman can it be Ron Burgundy?\" says Melanie Brown. \"At least that would be funny, rather than laughable.\" Best not to suggest alternative biffers, eh?</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>31st over: England 123-3 (Pietersen 22, Flintoff 4)</strong> In Throw Momma From The Train, during the writing class, one of the characters offers his opus: \"100 women I'd like to...\". I have an alternative idea: \"100 utterly mediocre spinners who have ... England during the middle overs of an ODI.\" Bestseller waiting to happen - fact, yeah? Botha has just joined the list that includes such luminaries as Mark Dekker, Sanath Jayasuriya, Aravinda de Silva, Daan van Bunge, Shoaib Mohammad, Chris Gayle, Dirk Viljoen (!) and other family favourites. Any publishers who are interested, feel free to contact my agent.</p> <p>I don't have an agent. Anyway, Botha should have had another wicket in that over. Pietersen went miles across to sweep, missed it, and was hit plumb in front basically. But so far across did he go that the umpire must have thought he got outside the line.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 126-3 (Pietersen 23, Flintoff 6)</strong> And still England accumulate. And still Matt Prior is the only man to have hit a boundary.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>33rd over: England 130-3 (Pietersen 26, Flintoff 7)</strong><br>Pietersen gets away with a brutally tight referral to the third umpire. He took a really tight two to fine leg, and had to dive to make his ground. But in doing so, his bat bounced up, and basically it was impossible to be absolutely certain that the bat had bounced up at the moment the wicket was broken - it seemed to do so just after. Had Boucher been a split-second slower, Pietersen would have been out. On such decisions are the extent of English defeats decided: it might only be with 10 overs to spare now.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>34th over: England 134-3 (Pietersen 28, Flintoff 8)</strong> The fantasy scenario is approaching - Pietersen and Flintoff, at the crease and in for the last 15 overs - but at the moment mundane reality prevails: just four from that Philander over. If I ever go on Room 101, the middle overs of an ODI involving England are going in first. Maybe second after George Lamb. Maybe third after George Lamb and, just in case the dog eats the first one, George Lamb. But they're going in.</p> <p>\"Re: over 31,\" begins Steve Betteley. \"My suggestions are Robert Croft, Neil Smith, Peter Such, Richard Daws.....I'm missing the point aren't I?\" It'd make for a cracking companion book.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 141-3 (Pietersen 30, Flintoff 13)</strong> Smart move from Smith, who brings back Dale Steyn with a view to taking the wicket that would stall England's charge before it even starts. For now it works in England's favour: the extra pace enables Flintoff to crunch one through the covers for four - the first boundary scored by someone other than Matt Prior in this game. Seven from the over.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 152-3 (Pietersen 32, Flintoff 22)</strong> Ntini (8-0-27-0) returns. As Nasser points out, Smith brought back his opening bowlers straight after the mandatory bowling change. The hard ball works both ways, and Flintoff lifts him high over the leg side, but after bouncing a few feet inside the rope it almost stops completely, so England only get two. Next ball he backs away and clubs it with a cross bat through extra cover for four. Top shot, and 11 from the over. Not unsurprisingly, it's the most profitable of the innings.</p> <p>\"Surely Swiss Toni for TMS,\" says Peter Joyner. \"'Playing cricket is very much like making love to a beautiful woman. Grab hold of the old bat, polish your balls and you've bowled a maiden over...'. Or something like that only much funnier.\"</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 158-3 (Pietersen 33, Flintoff 27)</strong> Pietersen is playing like Bevan at the moment - 33 from 46 balls with no fours - but that's okay while Flintoff is playing like Flintoff. He takes five the four deliveries he faces in that Steyn over and England, despite themselves, have a base to at least reach a workable total of 250.</p> <p>Anyone not in the pub?</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 160-3 (Pietersen 34, Flintoff 28)</strong> Philander is back on for Ntini. That's interesting, because he doesn't need to bowl (the fifth-bowler combination of Botha and Philander have already bowled 10 overs). Philander has at least three different slower balls, a couple of which keep Flintoff honest early in the over. The speeds for the first three balls were 81, 71 and 63mph. It's a really good over, in fact: just two from it. The crowd couldn't care less: they're all rendered on pints of Liver Compromiser and the Mexican wave has started.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 170-3 (Pietersen 41, Flintoff 31)</strong> Botha (6-0-23-1) also returns, which to my mind is an unnecessary risk because Pietersen could mangle him. But Botha's line (middle stump) and length (full) are really good to Pietersen, allowing him to take only three from the first three balls, the third of which brings up the fifty partnership from 62 balls. If they reach the hundred, it's fair to presume the second fifty won't take anywhere near as long.</p> <p>Later in the over Botha offers Pietersen a full toss, which he smears inevitably over midwicket for his first boundary of the innings. A dismal end to an otherwise good over: 10 from it.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 181-3 (Pietersen 46, Flintoff 36)</strong> Philander's first ball is a no-ball because there were only three men in the circle (Kallis at short fine leg should have been down at fine leg). It's the start of a profitable over for England: 11 from it. First Pietersen smears one gunbarrel-straight for four and then Flintoff, waiting for the slower ball, dumps it contemptuously over Philander's head for a one-bounce four.</p> <p>\"My brother has just sent me a text claiming he has had a message on the Guardian OBO for three matches in a row,\" says Chris Betteley. \"Apparently that's a good thing for him. Now I don't know the first thing about cricket and didn't realise there was a game on, but at the end of the text he just sent me it said 'in your face' like he's got one up on me. Can you please put this message on your OBO thing so I can shut him up.\" I bet the Betteley Christmas lunch is a cracker.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 194-3 (Pietersen 57, Flintoff 38)</strong> Nel is back but England are flying now: 13 more from that over. Pietersen belabours the first ball through the covers off the back foot to bring up his fifty from 55 balls, a very fine effort given that he's only scored three boundaries. </p> <p>From the next ball, he plays an astonishing shot. He walks miles across his stumps to sweep a length delivery - from Andre Nel, lest we forget - well outside off stump behind square for a spine-tingling boundary. Genius, right there.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 200-3 (Pietersen 58, Flintoff 42)</strong> Pietersen survives a big shout for LBW after being pinned by a slower off-cutter from Philander. It looked like there was enough doubt over height to justify Simon Taufel's decision even though Hawkeye had it clipping the top of middle. Six from the over.</p> <p>\"'And England, despite themselves, have a base to at least reach a workable total of 250,'\" quotes Tim Parkinson. \"Come on, Rob; this is tabloid and deeply uncharitable. Looks like England might actually be pacing it well, no?\" Sorry, but that's garbage. They are three wickets down with eight overs to go, which means Bell had no excuse for batting the way he did. <em>Pietersen and Flintoff</em> have paced it excellently, but not Bell.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 208-3 (Pietersen 60, Flintoff 48)</strong> Lovely shot from Flintoff, who makes room to lift a slower short ball over point for four. That makes it eight from the over.</p> <p>\"Come on then Smyth, and we both know you have a theory, so I'm asking the question: why do you think we've never had this Pietersen-Flintoff dream sequence?\" says RB McKinley. \"I know injury, but I mean, why has it never worked at the crease before?\" Everyone asks this, which means everyone has forgotten Edgbaston 05, the fools. I suppose in the past there might have been machismo issues - both are much humbler players these days - but I think it's more that they were in the wrong position in the order: Pietersen at No4, for example, is frequently in by the 10th over so unlikely to be around by the final 10. I'm all for a flexible order from Nos 3-8, the chief purpose of which (apart from scoring runs) is to get Pietersen in around the 20th over and Flintoff around the 32nd.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 211-3 (Pietersen 62, Flintoff 49)</strong> Philander is mixing his pace very well under pressure - while it seems obvious, it takes stones to bowl a 55mph off-cutter to Pietersen or Flintoff - and England get just three singles. Superb bowling.</p> <p>\"I think I'm the only person not in the pub!\" says Beth Connor. \"But does mean I can read the OBO without fear of discovery. Though to be fair I think my boss has been turning a blind eye to my sports monitoring antics. I know my chief exec knows; he keeps asking me for the score!\" What slovenly, two-bit shower would permit this level of skiving, you wonder? Yep, she's a civil servant.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 218-3 (Pietersen 64, Flintoff 54)</strong> Pietersen, miles short, would have been run out there by a direct hit from the bowler Nel, sprawling on the floor and throwing in one movement with his tongue flapping around like a lizard's. He missed.</p> <p>From the next ball, Flintoff tucks an attempted yorker off his pads for four to reach a really excellent fifty from 52 balls - his first for England since the CB Series of 2006-07. He looks in good nick, and he looks like he's enjoying it. I'm not sure which is the chicken and which is the egg, but it's refreshing to see the old Flintoff make an appearance. Seven from the over.</p> <p>\"Brian Sewell for TMS,\" says Alan White. \"'Thit's a wonderful, rustic shawt from Flintorf, one that recalls some of Gainsborough's more rustic landscapes..'.\"</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>46th over: England 232-3 (Pietersen 75, Flintoff 55)</strong> Steyn replaces Philander (8-0-37-0), yeah, and England take 14 from the over, yeah? Four of them are mowed thrillingly over wide mid-on by Pietersen, who then lifts the next ball all the way over long-on. Wonderful shot.</p> <p>\"Beth Connor can't possibly be a civil servant,\" says Zadok Prescott. \"It's past 5:30 and she's still at work.\" The wonder of flexitime, eh?</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>47th over: England 243-3 (Pietersen 76, Flintoff 66)</strong> Eleven from Nel's over. It begins when Flintoff works one to fine leg for four from miles outside off stump. Then from the fifth ball he does it again: same shot, albeit a fraction squarer, and the same result. Splendid stuff.</p> <p>\"Oh it's worse then that,\" begins Beth Connor. \"I'm a contractor working for the Civil Service. Otherwise I'd have slopped off to the pub at 4:10pm like everyone else. But to be fair you get paid to watch sports for a living!\"</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>48th over: England 257-3 (Pietersen 77, Flintoff 75)</strong> Flintoff strong-arms Steyn through the covers and, with the aid of some brainless fielding from Ntini on the cover boundary, gets four for it. He then gets four more with a wonderful shot. He was zig-zagging around his crease, so Steyn gave him one full and outside off stump. Flintoff just rifled it back whence it came for four. The next ball brings four more, albeit absurdly: Flintoff missed a full toss, which missed leg stump by a whisker and scuttled past Boucher. Fourteen from the over.</p> <p>\"It's but one Test and half an ODI into his tenure, but KP is looking an inspired choice for skipper,\" says Gary Naylor. \"I feel it's important to say this, because had KP been failing, the naysayers would be screaming.\" Just wait till he gets out switch-hitting. One obvious thing is that everyone appears to be enjoying themselves a lot more - Harmison even smiled during the Oval Test - but let's see how much fun they're having in the first Test in India when the home side are 452 for five in reply to England's 277 and Dhoni is whirling it everywhere. That was when the 03-05 Vaughan really came into his own.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>49th over: England 270-3 (Pietersen 87, Flintoff 78)</strong> Philander gets the penultimate over, and England take 13 from it. It shouldn't have been that many, but AB de Villiers of all people turns two into four with a shambolic misfield running round from long-on (I think). Pietersen salts the wound by lashing the next one through long-on for four.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 271-4 (Flintoff b Steyn 78)</strong> Flintoff's policy of walking across his stumps eventually brings about his downfall: he misses, Steyn hits. Simple. But so was Flintoff's batting: as cheerily uncomplicated as it was back in the day, and bringing him a splendid 78 from 70 balls in a partnership of 158 in 21 overs with his captain.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>50th over: England 275-4 (Pietersen 90, Wright 2)</strong> So only five from a very good last over from Steyn, and South Africa will need 276 to win: just about par I'd say.</p> <p>It really was an innings of two halves. Rigor Mortis, hiding under an Ian Bell mask, meant that England took only 99 from the first 25 overs; from the second 25 they took 176, most of them during a superb fourth-wicket partnership of 158 between Pietersen, who ends on 90 not out, and Flintoff. The captaincy isn't doing much harm to KP's batting at the moment, is it?</p> <p>I'm off to put something wet in my mouth. See you in 30 minutes for what should be a cracking run-chase.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>Mid-innings waffle</strong> \"Pouring a large glass of Devil's Advocaat, as I'm STILL not in the pub...couldn't you say that Freddie and KP are at their most vulnerable if they come in early and have to nurdle?\" says Alan White. \"In some ways Belly getting through the first 20 odd overs is helpful, even if he didn't exactly pile on the runs.\" I take the point, but I disagree: with a flexible order Bell can go at it from the off and, in real terms, you could have had five more overs of a punisher (Wright, Patel, whoever) plus all this from Flintoff and Pietersen. But the key lesson from this innings is that the timing of the arrival of Flintoff and Pietersen is absolutely crucial, and the only way to control that is to have a flexible batting order.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>Hello again</strong> \"What's remarkable about that list of the longest ODI innings without a boundary,\" begins Thom Scott-Phillips, \"is that if you reorder it by strike rate you find out that Ian Bishop once scored 14 off 3 balls (SR 466.66), <em>without scoring a boundary</em>.\" Ten overthrows and two twos? It's clearly a cock-up: he added 51 with Keith Arthurton, so if Bishop's share was 14, and from three balls, there would have been all sorts of tomfoolery going on.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 5-0 (chasing 276; Gibbs 2, Smith 1)</strong> Now this is interesting: England have given the new ball to Broad rather than Harmison. I like this move, partly because I really like Harmison at first change, and partly because Broad has earned the right with some very good one-day performances so far. It can be the making of a man, you know.</p> <p>His second ball is a wide, to Gibbs, but his third zips away from Smith's grope and the fourth takes a thick edge low to third man. It's a decent enough first over: five from it.</p> <p>Anyone out there?</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 10-0 (chasing 276; Gibbs 6, Smith 2)</strong> It's Anderson at the other end, as expected. Encouragingly, his first two balls to Smith swing different ways, first in and then out, but it's early swing and as such less dangerous. Later in the over he drifts one onto Gibbs's pads and is kissed to fine leg for four. </p> <p>\"England need to take a few early wickets and get Kallis in... and keep him in,\" says Gary Naylor. Kallis, like Bell, is an annoying one-day player because he hides his light under a bushel. I remember a game in the last World Cup against the West Indies when, possibly piqued by being accused of selfishness by the Aussies, he played some absolutely devastating shots.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 15-0 (chasing 276; Gibbs 6, Smith 7)</strong> Pietersen at mid-off turns four into one with a good piece of fielding but then that one into two with an unnecessary and errant throw. So overall he saved two. It's been a pretty low-key start, but South Africa will be content to be going at five an over without even acknowledging the long handle, never mind engaging it.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 21-0 (chasing 276; Gibbs 6, Smith 12)</strong> Smith drives Anderson for four, and then Gibbs touch Anderson just short of the man deliberately placed at short midwicket. Bah, gah and wah all at once. </p> <p>\"I'm not in the pub,\" says Phil Sawyer with what sounds like pride, but arguably shouldn't be. \"I'm at home having a cold Corona Extra and catching up on what I've missed having just got back from sorting out a loan prior to picking up my new planet unfriendly Civic Type R tomorrow. The mid-life crisis starts here. And the volley of abuse from green OBOers...\" Sadly that assumes that anyone is actually reading this.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 25-0 (chasing 276; Gibbs 7, Smith 15)</strong> Gibbs takes a bum-squeaking single to mid-on, but Wright fumbles it. Later in the over he turns four into two with a brilliant piece of work, chasing the ball down as might a mangy mutt and catching up with it a few paces inside the rope. </p> <p>\"So you'll probably be there till what, 10:30/11? <em>To the tune of that music they play when a six is hit</em> Ha ha de ha ha haha de ha ha ha ha de ha ha ha ha de ha ha ha ha de ha ha ha ha de ha ha de ha ha ha ha de ha ha,\" goads Sam Collins, who will do well to ha de ha when he's got my foot up hi</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 36-0 (chasing 276; Gibbs 11, Smith 15)</strong> It's still pretty muted, but Anderson had a biggish shout for LBW against Gibbs. It looked to be sliding down, and Hawkeye feels the same. Gibbs responds with a delicious and emphatic cover drive from around middle-and-leg. He gets four more next ball, leg-byes when Anderson errs. This has been a poor start from him - there were also three wides in that over - and South Africa are flying without really having had to spread their wings.</p> <p>\"I've been a long time viewer of OBO, MBM and the like, and I've yet to <br>see one that doesn't include the words 'Gary' and 'Naylor',\" says Stu Urch. \"Does anybody at Guardian Towers or any fellow OBOers recall such an occasion!?\" As with mobile phones, Peep Show and Liver Compromiser, I don't really remember life before Gary Naylor.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 45-0 (chasing 276; Gibbs 18, Smith 17)</strong> Smith, I forgot to say, is ranked No1 in the official ODI batting rankings. But at the moment I'm just enjoying Gibbs. This will surely be the last series in which we'll see him - he's 34 now - and even though he hasn't always delivered (his Test average should be higher than 41.95), when he has done so he has had the hairs on the back of his neck completely at his mercy. To prove the point he has just driven Broad inside-out over wide mid-off for six. Glorious stuff, and England have no option but to call for Harmison and especially Flintoff ahead of schedule.</p> <p>In other news, some floodgates have just opened: South Africa have officially told the ICC that they are pulling out of the Champions Trophy if it is held in Pakistan.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 50-1 (Smith c Prior b Harmison 21)</strong> Who writes his scripts? Harmison takes a wicket in his first over back, and it was a good delivery too: a lifting leg-cutter that kissed Smith's edge on its way through to Prior. Harmison is mobbed by his team-mates, who all seemed really delighted, as much for him as because of the context of the game. England really, really needed that.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 50-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 18, Kallis 0)</strong> One thing we sometimes forget about Harmison is that he brings out the animal in all of us. A disinterested crowd are suddenly baying for blood, woooooooooohing every ball, and that must impact upon the batsmen as well.</p> <p>\"I'm here, wondering when to crack open my bottle of Saffer Shiraz Rose,\" says Clare Davies. \"Thinking I might save it until my local librarian drops in for a drink, bringing with her, hopefully, Jonathan Wilson's latest opus magnus. So cheers, Rob \u2013 I think I might be losing the plot a bit, but never mind. Semper fideles or is it fidelis? I never can mind.\"</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 60-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 28, Kallis 0)</strong><br>Mixed over from Broad. Okay, a naff over with one good bit. Either side of beating Gibbs with a gem, he gifts four balls: one touched to leg and the other larruped through the covers off the back foot. Stop: Freddietime.</p> <p>Okay, so apparently that Champions Trophy story this is old news. But more importantly: has anyone heard about the bloody Titanic?!</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 65-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 28, Kallis 5)</strong> Kallis gets off the mark in style, square-driving Harmison to the fence. Despite that wicket, South Africa are still cruising: their run-rate is 6.50 and the required-rate only 5.27.</p> <p>\"I can't believe there is not a 'Gary Naylor for prime minister' group on Facebook yet,\" says Dave Tovey. \"Guess what I'm going to be doing tomorrow?!\" Discreetly watching porn, openly watching Soccer Saturday (postmodern porn) and then drinking pints of Knee-Weakener in the evening? Oh.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 71-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 33, Kallis 6)</strong> Old Man Flintoff is on for Broad (5-0-33-0), but Gibbs couldn't care about that. He just swaggers away and down the pitch, like the Fonz entering a room, and slams a length ball over mid-off for four. That was a shot of the purest talent, because it was a heavy, 89mph ball.</p> <p>England, by the way, were 46 for none after 11 overs. \"Rob,\" says Paul Spencer. \"Tell Clare Davies to open her plonk now. Otherwise, she might have to share it.\"</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 73-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 34, Kallis 7)</strong> Two from Harmison's over. \"Is it just Headingley or is this \"no spinner\" selection a change of policy?\" says Gary Naylor. \"I like slower bowling in ODIs, but if a spinner doesn't warrant his place, I'd be happy with four speedsters and some dibbly-dobbling. Oh, I've missed Samit Patel - something I feel Herschelle won't.\" Suspect it's a Headingley assumption, although they also did it the other day. I'm all for only four specialist bowlers - if two of them are Broad and Flintoff, you get a really long batting line-up - but I'd like to see Swann in the side in all bar the most extreme conditions (which these aren't), especially as we're theoretically building towards a World Cup on the subcontinent.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 85-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 34, Kallis 19)</strong> Four to Kallis, walking across his stumps to ping Flintoff through square-leg. It's a shot of brilliant, languid authority. He does it again two balls later, to a poor delivery this time, and then slices four more through the vacant slip area. South Africa are already 34 ahead of where England were at this stage. After 13 overs, that's a big difference, and I'm afraid this game is going only one way. That said, if South Africa keep up this rate of clatter, I might make Eviction Night!</p> <p>\"Still here, still reading, desperately wish I wasn't,\" says Richard Sheffle. He wrote a bit after that, but this is pretty much the gist.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 90-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 34, Kallis 23)</strong> Kallis may have read the entry for the second over, because he's playing beautifully: when Harmison bangs one in, Kallis swivels to sweet-spot it over square-leg for a one-bounce four. <em>This is how you bat in the Powerplays overs</em>.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 91-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 35, Kallis 23)</strong> A much, much better over from Flintoff, the sort we've seen a million times before. One from it. Meanwhile, Pietersen has had enough and done one, presumably for a toilet break, so Cook is on the field. I wonder who the stand-in captain is. Flintoff? <em>Bell</em>? Bloody hell.</p> <p>\"Any chance of a pic of Gary Naylor?\" says James Cook. \"He's part of the OBO furniture, would be good to see what he looked like...\" I'm got a cob on now: nobody ever asks for a picture of me. Admittedly there are good reasons for this, most of them aesthetic and some of them legal, but still.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 93-2 (Gibbs b Patel 37)</strong></p> <p>In one-day cricket, not taking a Powerplay is pretty much equivalent to waving the white flag. England haven't taken the Powerplay. It's Pietersen's decision - he's back on now - and with the field able to go back he brings on the left-arm spin of Samit Patel. And Patel has struck with his fourth ball! It skidded on and went straight through Gibbs, who had made room to go through or over the off side. Well, well, well. It's an inspired move by Kevin Pietersen, and from hereon in I may keep my opinions on Powerplays to myself.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 93-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 24, de Villiers 0)</strong> One obscenely gifted all-round sportsman replaces another: de Villiers is the new batsman. But that's a great start for Patel, whose figures are 1-0-2-1. It's not his debut - he played and took a wicket against Scotland the other day - but it will feel like it.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 96-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 26, de Villiers 1)</strong> Now Pietersen <em>does</em> take the Powerplay, a decision with which I totally agree. One more wicket and England will feel very confident, because South Africa don't have quite as dangerous a lower-middle order as usual (no Albie Morkel for one). After that we have Duminy, Boucher, Philander, Botha and then the bowlers. Three runs from Flintoff's over, including a peach that squared up and beat Kallis.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 100-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 30, de Villiers 1)</strong> With Patel's work done, Harmison returns to the attack, but his first ball is a touch too short, a touch too wide, and Kallis screams it behind point for four. He tries to do the same later in the over to a ball that was shorter and got bigger, but only succeeds in sending fresh air racing away to the fence. Four from the over.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 100-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 30, de Villiers 1)</strong> Maiden from Flintoff, or \"Flintstone\" as David Gower just called him. \"I was pictured on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/22/olympics20082\">Olympics MBM</a> earlier today,\" says Gary Naylor. \"I quote Scott Murray at 11.43am, 'Hong Kong Charlie is right about the Modern Pentathlon being based on the skills of a 19th century British soldier - an officer,' writes Naylor (<a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Karl_Marx.jpg\">pictured here</a>). 'If it were based on the life of a squaddie, it would comprise: being shouted at; forcing pay out of reluctant quartermasters; getting by on half-rations; wearing cheap, unsuitable clothing; and not sharing in the proceeds of Empire'.\"</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 108-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 33, de Villiers 6)</strong> Beautiful shot from de Villiers, blasting a wide, fullish delivery from Harmison square on the off side for four. Eight from the over, and South Africa are still in a <em>rea</em>sonable amount of control.</p> <p>\"I hope you aren't going to be watching that disgusting Big Brother! One of them can't use the toilet properly! You'll start with your dirty tricks again! Love etc, Mother.\" Says David Weston.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 120-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 35, de Villiers 15)</strong> Kallis is limping fairly badly after taking a sharp single. If anything significant comes of it, you'll hear it here fourth. De Villiers then takes Flintoff for consecutive boundaries, one to third man and one to fine leg. </p> <p>\"Keeping Gary Naylor's identity under wraps would be a far greater homage to him as he would then become the Thomas Pynchon of the OBO,\" says Ian Copestake. \"Perhaps he too could then appear on The Simpsons with a bag over his head, while telling Homer exactly why baseball is not really a sport.\"</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 124-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 38, de Villiers 16)</strong> Now that the Powerplay overs are done, Pietersen goes back to Samit Patel. His left-arm spin looks quite rudimentary - don't play for turn, basically - but South Africa content themselves with having a look at his bowling for now: four from the over.</p> <p>It has started raining at Headingley, though not badly enough for the players to come off yet.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 128-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 39, de Villiers 19)</strong> Another bowling change: Bopara for Flintoff, and his first over brings four no-risk runs for South Africa. How England could do with a middle-overs wickettaker in ODIs. The fear here is that Patel and Bopara bowl 10 overs, are milked easily for 55-60, and South Africa are left needing 100 from the last 17 overs.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 132-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 41, de Villiers 21)</strong> Clare Davies sends a longish email about the history of the Modern Pentathlon. Just as I'm about to cut and paste it onto the OBO, the will to do so inexplicably drains out of me.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 139-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 46, de Villiers 23)</strong> Short from Bopara, and Kallis's withering pull gets past, sliding round at deep midwicket. England are really struggling here, and I think he should give a two/three-over spell to Anderson, because they desperately need a wicket.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 141-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 47, de Villiers 24)</strong> Pietersen is whirling his arms, which suggests he'll be on pretty soon. That's a risk because he bowls four-balls, but maybe his personality can buy a wicket. If England don't get one in the next five overs it's hard to see how they can win this game. Decent stuff from Patel, though: just two from the over and his figures are a very respectable 4-0-12-1.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 142-3 (De Villiers c Bell b Pietersen 24)</strong> Is there anything this bloke doesn't do? He desperately wanted a wicket, so he brought himself and got it in his first over. De Villiers, trying to clip a straight one over midwicket, only found the safe hands of Ian Bell.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 142-3 (chasing 276; Kallis 48, Duminy 0)</strong> Now's surely the time to get Harmison or Anderson, or maybe even Flintoff for just two overs, on to try to bully the young lad Duminy.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 146-3 (chasing 276; Kallis 51, Duminy 1)</strong> For now Patel continues, and Kallis drives him lazily through extra-cover to bring up a good fifty, from 62 balls and with seven fours. Duminy, a left-hander who averages 138 in ODIs this year, then gets off the mark with a premeditated lap for one.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 149-4 (Kallis run out 52)</strong> Another Pietersen over, another wicket, and this one is massive. Kallis tucked Pietersen to leg, but there was a mix-up with Duminy, and the fielder coming in from midwicket (Bell I think) did really well to sense that a) Kallis was the wicket they wanted and b) Kallis was struggling with his leg. He sent a sharp throw to Pietersen, who gleefully did the rest and celebrated long before it was confirmed by the third umpire. What's cricketese for Goldenballs?</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 149-4 (chasing 276; Duminy 3, Boucher 0)</strong> \"Pace Mr Copestake (21st Over) \"I'm tempted to adopt a Pynchonesque writing style, but I suspect it wouldn't match the culture of the OBO,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Lacking in snappiness, I feel. The bag over the head is an excellent suggestion though. Thomas Pynchon, John Merrick and me!\"</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 152-4 (chasing 276; Duminy 3, Boucher 3)</strong> KP gave Duminy a right mouthful after that wicket, presumably informing him that he's just cost South Africa the game. Should Pietersen stick or twist now? Does he carry on with the spinners and allow Boucher - a devastating death-hitter - to play himself in, even if it's only at three or four an over? Or does he give Flintoff two overs to try to nail Boucher and make England big favourites? For now he continues with Patel, and I'm not going to argue with that. Three from the over.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 159-4 (chasing 276; Duminy 3, Boucher 9)</strong> Pietersen lets slip a high full-toss and Boucher smears it for four. Seven from the over, and that'll do for KP I reckon. He's more than done what he came on for.</p> <p>Tim Knights points out that Warwickshire are 17 for 7 chasing 200ish in the Pro40 against Glamorgan. At least they've got Ashley Giles coming in at No8 eh? Oh.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 166-4 (chasing 276; Duminy 4, Boucher 14)</strong> Boucher has looked really good so far, and in that over cleverly steers Patel for four. Patel has now bowled seven and Pietersen three, but they don't need to carry on. But I suspect they will, at the very least until the ball is replaced in two overs' time.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 167-5 (Boucher st Prior b Pietersen 16)</strong> Unbelievable. Boucher missed a sweep at Pietersen, but was remarkably slovenly when it came to dragging his back foot - which was on the line - back into the crease. That's amazingly negligent, and Pietersen has done it again. If he doesn't wake up tomorrow morning having dreamed about a cure for cancer - or at the very least a way to get George Lamb off the air - it will be a major surprise. He's having an unbelievable day.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 169-5 (chasing 276; Duminy 6, Botha 1)</strong> That was, we should also note in view of past incidents, a really smart piece of work from Matt Prior. Pietersen has doubled his ODI wickets tally. What this man has done since taking over is a complete joke.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 172-5 (chasing 276; Duminy 8, Botha 2)</strong> England are all over South Africa now, and Pietersen even had a slip in for Patel against the new batsman Botha (ODI average: 18.00; List A average: 20.65). Botha responds by premeditating a sweep for a single. Duminy does likewise, and gets two, but England will take three from the over all night.</p> <p>\"So Darrell Hair has quit umpiring?\" sniffs Tom Hopkins. \"I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed. Stuffy and self important he may have been, but he did have the admirable quality of not being Rudi Koertzen.\"</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>35th over: South Africa 180-5 (chasing 276; Duminy 9, Botha 9)</strong> Remarkably, SA are 38 runs ahead of England at this stage, although they've lost two more wickets. Pietersen's first ball with the newer ball is a disgusting full toss, and Botha swats it over midwicket for four. Pietersen then almost gets his third wicket: he tempted Duminy with a bit of flight, but Duminy's whip fell not far short of Broad at long-on.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 187-5 (chasing 276; Duminy 14, Botha 11)</strong> Patel lures Botha into a leading edge, which plops safely into the covers. Duminy then steers one to third man, and some superb running brings three. Another decent over for South Africa - seven from it - and I reckon it's time to go back to the seamers.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>37th over: South Africa 190-5 (chasing 276; Duminy 16, Botha 12)</strong> A good move, this: Flintoff replaces Pietersen (5-0-22-2). There's a referral to third umpire second ball, but Botha was comfortably home. Wouldn't it be great if the third umpire got messed up on booze one day by accident and just started pressing the wrong button to mess with people's heads? Oh.</p> <p>Anyway it's really good stuff from Flintoff (is that tautologous?). Three from the over, and that means South Africa need 86 from 13 overs.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 196-5 (chasing 276; Duminy 17, Botha 17)</strong> Botha reverse-sweeps Patel for four, and that's Patel's lot. He's done a really good job: 10-0-42-1.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 202-5 (chasing 276; Duminy 18, Botha 20)</strong> The balance has shifted back towards South Africa, in the sense that England have removed their catchers. Six from a Flintoff over is worth eight or nine from anyone else's, so South Africa will be happy with that. </p> <p>They need 74 from 11 overs. Where's your money? Mine, I suppose, is dotted around London and Rochester in various watering holes, but that which remains I'm still putting on England. But it's a close thing because these two look like good players, and Botha in particular looks a lot better than his modest averages suggest.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 202-6 (Duminy c Prior b Harmison 18)</strong> Brilliant from Harmison, brilliant from Prior, brilliant from England, brilliant from life! Harmison really ramped up the pressure with three dot balls, and when Duminy felt for and snicked the fourth Prior took a good, tumbling catch. England are right back in the box seat now, feet up and demanding the remote.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 205-6 (chasing 276; Botha 20, Philander 1)</strong> Oh Stephen Harmison. After that brilliant start, his first two balls to Philander are both wides. Philander is no mug by the way: he averages 29.73 in List A cricket and 40.00 in ODIs (though that's only from six games). After this, however, it's a mug's gallery: Nel, Steyn, someone else whose names escapes me. Ntini, that's it.</p> <p> <br>Here's Jim Harris. \"Surely that is the cricket equivalent of Goldenballs - or maybe it is Goldenswingers (TM The Fiver). Or if he was from Pakistan, Golden Reverse Swingers.

Balls to you, firewalls!</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 211-6 (chasing 276; Botha 23, Philander 3)</strong> Broad is on for Flintoff, whose last two overs are rightly being saved for the end. Botha thuds one into the ground and, as it bounces back towards his stumps, steers it away with the back of the bat. Six from the over, and that'll do for England, as South Africa now need 65 from nine overs.</p> <p>\"With 2012 on the horizon, can't we get KP to train up for a few Olympic sports in which we're still a bit short?\" says Justin Barrett. \"Greco-Roman wrestling..? Fencing..? Middle-distance running..?\"</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 211-6 (chasing 276; Botha 23, Philander 3)</strong> A maiden from Harmison to Philander. Excellent stuff, and the required run-rate is ticking up faster than one of those old-school train boards: South Africa now need 8.12 from each of the last eight overs. Meanwhile, the camera cuts to a seriously big-boned man with an egg-white goatee. \"Look at Mike Gatting\" deadpans Bumble.</p> <p>\"I guess the selectors' punts tonight are Patel, Prior and, to some extent, Harmison. It appears that they have all done well. Is this the start of building a squad of 16 ODI cricketers to rotate through the international programme as conditions dictate?\" says Gary Naylor. \"It's a nice thought.\" I have a couple of other nice thoughts which I suspect won't eventuate any time soon; even though it's after the watershed, it's probably best they're kept in-house.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>43rd over: South Africa 215-6 (chasing 276; Botha 24, Philander 5)</strong> The squeeze is really on now, and Philander can barely get it off the square. Four from the over means the target is 61 from seven.</p> <p>Andrew Losowsky has just emerged from his DeLorean, panting furiously but with one helluva story to tell. \"England will of course win this game, Pietersen will be hailed as a combination of Diego Maradona, Viv Richards and the lord Jaysus Chris, and tomorrow's newspapers will be filled with steaming praise and shouts of 'BRING ON THE AUSSIES!'. Then we'll lose this series 4-1, Pietersen will be reviled as a South African babykiller who never really cared for the English flag, and Stuart Broad will be handed the one-day captaincy because he drew a Jack when the others only got numbered cards. And your name is Kolley Kibber and I claim my five pounds.\"</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>44th over: South Africa 219-6 (chasing 276; Botha 26, Philander 7)</strong> Harmison is really bullying Philander, driving him back into his crease. Philander is trying to play orthodox shots but, as Nasser observes, he just needs to have a big yahoo at one of these. Finally he does, and it plops pitifully short of mid-on. Just four singles from the over. Cashback!</p> <p>Here's Phil Sawyer. \"Dear Apple, could you explain why iTunes is saying the 60s ska tunes I'VE JUST BLOODY BOUGHT OFF YOU are not authorized to be played on my pc?

They need 36 from three overs.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>48th over: South Africa 243-7 (chasing 276; Philander 23, Nel 7)</strong> Flintoff tightens the noose with a superb death over that brings just three runs, and South Africa need 33 from the last two overs.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>WICKET!

Botham?</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>WICKET: South Africa 255 all out (Ntini b Flintoff 2); ENGLAND WIN BY 20 RUNS</strong> Flintoff yorks Ntini, and England go 1-0 up in the series. The key, unusually for Headingley, was spin: Samit Patel and particularly Kevin Pietersen turned the game at a time when South Africa were cruising, and in the end England won comfortably.</p> <p>It's a real feelgood victory, this: everything Pietersen did in the field came off (oh, and he got 90 not out), Andrew Flintoff batted with a big smile and a big bat on his way to 78, Steve Harmison returned to one-day cricket with a big wicket in his first over and excellent figures of two for 43, and Matt Prior kept wicket flawlessly.</p> <p>It wasn't perfect - don't get me started on Ian Bell's innings; I'm in a good mood - but it was a lot better than many of us expected. And the best thing is that the whole England team looked like they had a bloody good time. As did I. Thanks for all your emails, especially those of you who gave up a life (what do you mean you don't have one?) to stay with us on a Friday night.</p>",

To justify more if it, the UK government argued coal was a cheap back-up to unreliable renewables and fickle gas suppliers, and would protect jobs and investment in the industry. But costs of building the stations and buying the fuel are rising steeply, and a growing list of experts are arguing the UK can easily keep the lights on and create jobs and prosperity by investing in renewable energy and efficiency. </p> <p>But reducing the country's dependence on gas from Russia, so the argument goes, is still vital to protect the country from future power cuts and economic gloom. So what to make of the latest figures published by the <a href=\"http://www.berr.gov.uk/energy/statistics/publications/dukes/page39771.html\">Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform</a> (DBERR)? </p> <p>They show not only that seven out of 10 lumps of coal come from overseas, but that nearly half of those imports come from our same friends in Russia. Coal experts point out that, unlike gas which often travels down expensive fixed pipes, it is relatively easy to switch suppliers of their product, and Russia has only a fraction of the global market. In 2006, it was the sixth biggest producer but still supplied less than 5% of global consumption. </p> <p>But more importantly a closer look at gas imports shows that the UK is not yet dependent on Russian gas either \u2013 its biggest supplier is Norway, and Russian gas comes in the mix through the European grid. </p> <p>Gas might eventually be more of a risk, but reliance on Russian coal does seem to back-up those who argue that no fossil fuel is as politically neutral as wind (simply \"it's there\", as one campaigner says) or efficiency. </p> <p>Whatever your preferred alternative, coal imports do seem to further weaken the government's increasingly fragile case for building unabated new coal power. If ministers do decide to press ahead, they might have some explaining to do.</p>",
  "<p>Government prevarication over funding for Olympic athletes could lead to a deterioration in Britain's performance at London 2012, UK Sport warned today.</p> <p>John Steele, chief executive of the body that distributes funding to elite athletes, said that Britain should aim to win more medals in London than have been secured here, but that his organisation needed certainty about its future income if the momentum gained in Beijing is not to be wasted.</p> <p>\"The biggest victory in sport is the athletes standing on the podium, and to give them the support they need, which has been missing in the past, it takes resources,\" said Steele. \"In Britain we have a habit of succeeding at sport or in huge events and then dipping after them or being complacent, and that cannot happen here. We cannot do anything that will jeopardise the next four, eight or 12 years, because we have an opportunity to create something that is world class, so that when the Rebecca Adlingtons of this world are retiring as multiple Olympic champions, their successors are already in the world-class environment to deliver sustained success.\"</p> <p>Team GB is certain to surpass UK Sport's pre-Games target of eighth in the medal table, and has comfortably hit its total target of 35-41 medals of which 10-12 were forecast to be gold. At the time of writing, the team has 18 gold medals and are guaranteed at least 44 in total.</p> <p>Despite this success the government has declined to guarantee that UK Sport will receive all of its promised funding in the next four years. Gordon Brown has demanded that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport raises \u00a3100m from the private sector but, two years after he set the target as Chancellor, not a single penny has been raised.</p> <p>This week the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, launched a national sponsorship scheme to raise the money, but senior figures with knowledge of the scheme are sceptical about how effective it will be and Burnham has refused to guarantee that the government will make up any shortfall.</p> <p>Steele said yesterday that UK Sport would continue on the basis that the full funding package would be delivered, but said continued uncertainty could damage future medal hopes.</p> <p>\"It's been made very clear to us to budget on that money being in place and we will continue to do that until we hear any different,\" he said. \"We know what we have been told what to budget and we will do that, but where the money comes from is not directly our responsibility. We will support the government in any schemes they try to do but from our point of view we really need some certainty moving forward.\"</p> <p>UK Sport is to conduct a review of all the Olympic sports after the Games before meeting to set 2012 funding levels in October, and it is likely that athletics will be the subject of most debate.</p> <p>UK Athletics receives more funding than any other sport but its results continue to disappoint. They were set a target of five medals before the Games and have four so far, but with Sebastian Coe stressing the importance of \"big British moments\" in track and field come 2012 there is huge pressure to deliver an improvement.</p> <p>Dave Collins, the performance director, may find his role the subject of debate when his contract expires in March next year, and Steele said athletics could face a funding cut if it could not demonstrate potential for medals in 2012.</p> <p>\"We want to see evidence of development and success and wouldn't make any exceptions across the board. It is the national governing body's [UK Athletics] job to ensure that they have the world class performance directors and coaches in place to take the sport forward.\"</p> <p>Liz Nicholl, UK Sport's director of performance, said a smaller team could be sent to London. \"Athletics would themselves agree that they have not delivered in the way that our most successful sports have, and internally they know they have a long way to go,\" she said. \"They know they have to create a better environment for athletes and better level of influence and support for personal coaches.<br> \"You have to be prepared to make some very tough decisions about which athletes you fund. We want to focus on athletes with potential for 2012, not 2009-10, so it could be a smaller team in London.\"</p> <p>Steele said he wanted to see world-class coaches and performance directors in place. \"It is the national governing body's job to ensure that they have the world class poerformance directors and coaches in place to take the sport forward, and while we are there to support them it is their decision.</p> <p>\"But we invest in the sport and we would expect that investment to be well used, and we would expect to understand why they are making certain decisions, but in the end we are not there to run the sport.\"</p>",

  "<p>Gordon Brown today praised China for allowing greater media freedom during the Beijing Olympics and urged the country's president, Hu Jintao, to continue the policy after the Games are over. </p> <p>Arriving in Beijing for the end of the event, the prime minister said that he welcomed China's decision to ease some of the restrictions facing journalists while the Olympics were being staged. </p> <p>At a meeting with the Chinese president, Brown said that it would be in China's own interest to make the easing of restrictions on journalists permanent.</p> <p>After a trip that involved a visit to Afghanistan, Brown arrived in Beijing for the final days of the Games, including the formal handover to London for the 2012 Olympics at the closing ceremony on Sunday. </p> <p>The question of press freedom was one of a number of human-rights issues that the prime minister raised during his one-hour meeting with the Chinese president. </p> <p>Hu, in turn, used his opening remarks at their meeting in the Great Hall of the People to refer to the controversial London leg of the Olympic torch relay earlier this year. </p> <p>\"When the Olympic torch ran in London, Mr Prime Minister, you personally welcomed the torch and you also expressed support for the Beijing Olympic Games for which we would like to express our appreciation and gratitude,\" he told Brown. </p> <p>The event was in fact dominated by pro-Tibet protests, while Brown notoriously refused to touch the torch himself when he welcomed the relay in Downing Street. </p> <p>No 10 aides insisted, however, that Hu's comments had not been intended as a barbed reference to the torch's reception in London and that the \"atmospherics\" between the two men had been very good. </p> <p>Brown said that he had made clear that he hoped the greater openness that the Olympics had brought would not end once the Games were over. </p> <p>Following pressure from international journalists, while the Olympics have been staged the Chinese have allowed access to internet sites that were previously banned in the country. </p> <p>Brown told reporters: \"It is in China's interest. It would be a very important gesture to the rest of the world if they were to say that these restrictions could be permanently removed.\" </p> <p>Brown said that he also urged the Chinese to pursue their talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama regarding greater autonomy for Tibet, in order to reach a \"productive\" conclusion when discussions reopen in the autumn. </p> <p>\"I think there is more common ground between the Chinese authorities and Tibet than is sometimes realised,\" he said. </p> <p>The prime minister also tackled Hu over China's stance on Zimbabwe and Darfur, where it has been criticised for supporting repressive regimes. </p> <p>\"He responded by saying that these are issues that will be part of our continuing discussions,\" Brown said. </p> <p>At his meeting with Hu, Brown also praised the \"spectacular success\" of the Beijing Games. </p> <p>\"With the whole world watching, the Olympic Games have captured the imagination of the whole global community,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The 2008 Beijing Olympics have set a new standard for the Olympic Games which we in London in 2012 will seek to follow.\" </p> <p>The prime minister is also planning to use his visit to look at ways of ensuring that the UK's medal haul in Beijing is not a one-off and that Britain's athletes can build on their success in 2012. </p> <p>He will be attending a reception for some of Britain's up-and-coming 2012 hopefuls as well as some of the remaining events where Team GB is hoping for a place in the medals. </p> <p>Brown is in Beijing with his wife Sarah, and their two young sons, John, four, and Fraser, two, who were said to be excited at the prospect of seeing some of the Olympic action.</p>",
  "<p> A bit old hat ... John Updike. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe</p> <p>In his latest novel, The Widows of Eastwick, which will be published in October, John Updike puts these words into the mouth of one of his characters: \"...print doesn't mean to people what it used to, it may be. A considerable number get what news they need off the internet. They don't need much. Sports, celebrities. For self-advertisement there's all this blogging. It's amazing to me that anyone has time to read such crap, but I guess they do.\"</p> <p>It's fair to assume that this opinion is not far from the author's own. In an address to booksellers at the Book Expo convention in Washington, in 2006, Updike spelled out his belief that the <a href=\"www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25updike.html \">web was bad for literature</a>, saying: \"Yes, there is a ton of information on the web, but much of it is egregiously inaccurate, unedited, unattributed and juvenile.\" He's right, of course, but the situation he describes could be equally applied to the publishing industry at any stage since Gutenberg invented movable type. Not every imprint is a beacon of exactness and probity.</p> <p>As I struggled to make my way through this tepid follow-up to The Witches of Eastwick, it struck me that the irrelevance of the novel was not entirely due to the fact that it laboriously details the aches and pains of white, middle-class American matrons. Rather, its insignificance lies in the fact the characters inhabit a world that has disappeared. When they are not gossiping on land line telephones, the three widows write long information-strewn letters to each other which they despatch via the mail. It's been a long time since my postman delivered anything other than final demands and takeaway flyers. Sukie, one of the main characters, is dismayed to find upon returning to Eastwick that the rather smart local newspaper she helped produce has been closed down and replace by a cheap Xeroxed sheet. Xerox? Even the smallest hamlets now have their dedicated websites providing details on the latest ominous planning development and a 24-hour webcam trained on the duck pond.</p> <p>At least I read The Widows of Eastwick to the end. I gave up on Updike's last novel, Terrorist, at the point where the reader was introduced to a West Indian school teacher who had never heard of Jennifer Lopez. If Updike spent even a little time in the, admittedly often dispiriting, online environment, his characters might seem less ossified.</p> <p>Updike makes no secret of <a href=\"http://www.nerve.com/screeningroom/books/interview_johnupdike/ \">his aversion to the web</a> and it is clear he will not be wasting his time reading this or any other online opinion of his novels. That's fair enough - but whether a novelist such as Updike can so blithely ignore the seismic shift in how we gather our information is a moot point. As he explains in a collection of essays and criticism, Odd Jobs: \"To begin to write, I needed the sensation that I was about to reveal what had never yet been quite revealed...\" This venturesome sense of wonder is, to me, at the heart of Updike's appeal. His withdrawal from the hurly-burly of contemporary communication may be one reason why his novels have become less despatches from the frontline than cosy remembrances of things past.</p>",

  "<p><br>Theatre or bust? ... Drama Queens, which opens at The Old Vic on October 12</p> <p>Forty years ago the art historian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fried\">Michael Fried</a> attacked contemporary sculpture for what he called its \"theatricality\". This might seem a strange thing to say about minimalism's simple, anonymous forms, but what it acknowledged was how the relationship between object and viewer was coming to be central to the experience of the art work. The term wooden acting suddenly took on a whole new meaning. For many people, me included, that was a good rather than a bad thing. It brought attention to questions of time, situation, environment, and bodily presence in ways that have proved fruitful in the years since. </p> <p>One of Fried's reference points was the six-foot steel cube sculpture, Die, whose dimensions its maker <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/features/tuchman/tuchman7-14-98.asp\">Tony Smith</a> explained by saying it was neither monument or object. In other words, perhaps, it was a figure, and this opens up the prospect of a whole host of sculptures finding new careers on the stage: Picasso's women speaking permanent asides out of the corners of their mouths, Degas girls pirouetting across the boards, Henry Moore nudes rising from their reclining positions to stretch aching limbs, or maybe a host of Antony Gormleys coming together in a zombie horde to restage <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gUKvmOEGCU\">Night of the Living Dead</a>.</p> <p>In light of this, the news that Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset's <a href=\"http://www.oldvictheatre.com/whatson.php?id=48\">Drama Queens</a> is to be performed at The Old Vic is welcome. The Danish Elmgreen and Norwegian Dragset are the embodiment of this ongoing dialogue between art and theatre. Elmgreen trained as an artist, Dragset went to theatre school, and over the past decade their collaborations have set up a series of problematic and provoking interactions between viewer, space and objects.</p> <p>Drama Queens is a short play whose dramatis personae comprises seven 20th century sculptures. Between them they represent most of the major \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/art-safari1.shtml\">isms</a>\" in recent art, and the conversations that fly back and forth as they move around the stage pitches the different expressive views associated with these tendencies against one another. This may sound a bit dry, but the first, most important thing to say about it is that it is hilarious.</p> <p>Scripted by Tim Etchells, the various sculptures are voiced as shorthand versions of their artists. Giacometti's <a href=\"http://www.univie.ac.at/cga/art/giacometti.jpg\">Walking Man</a> speaks lugubriously in a Swiss-Italian accent of his need to find a Garbo-like solitude; Barbara Hepworth's <a href=\"http://www.hammer.ucla.edu/collections/4/work_29.htm\">Elegy III</a> is forever gasping for a fag; <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Ulrich_R%C3%BCckriem\">Ulrich R\u00fcckriem</a>'s Untitled (Granite) demands beer and says \"Scheisse\" every other word; while Jeff Koon's <a href=\"http://www.balloonhq.com/highlights/koons/rabbit.html\">Rabbit</a> rushes around manically trying to persuade everyone else to party. Amidst the welter of conflicting ideas, Jean Arp's <a href=\"http://images.encyclopedia.com/ency4beta_getimage.aspx?id=932765&amp;hero=yes\">Cloud Shepherd</a> tries to make common cause with Elegy III, but you know it's a desperate move. After half an hour of \"my way is better than yours\", the denouement, involving a cameo by Andy Warhol's Brillo Box, is particularly satisfying.</p> <p>So, instead of going to the museum and getting sore feet, just for once let the museum come to you. It'll be worth it.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Sachin will be here shortly with all the early morning action.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>Sachin will be here shortly with all the early morning action.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>Sachin will be here shortly with all the early morning action.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1.59am</strong> So here we go then with BMX then and the Cool Canadian (geddit) is about to ride.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.03am</strong> Chausson, from France, wins the first heat and having ridden through 93% humidity and over a number of dunes on a bike similar to the one my dad got me for my 11th birthday, rightly looks knackered</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2.05am</strong> That American woman looks like a hired-killer. Come on Reade!</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2.07am</strong> Our girl's gone down! bmx rider down! these olympics, so great up to now, have just gone up in smoke. shame, real shame</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.08am</strong> She seems to have hurt her bum.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.10am</strong> Another French woman, Le Corguille, won Reade's heat. The Brit is not out of it yet though - both semi-finals are run three times - so there is still time for her to add to Team GB's gold haul. Fingers crossed....</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.16am</strong> The fantastically-named Kamakazi lives up to his name by falling of his bike in the men's second semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.20am</strong> So it's back to the Birds Nest for the decathlon, where, after the half-way stage, Bryan Clay of the USA is leading. Can the 110m hurdles shake things up? lets see</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2.23am</strong> Cuba's Yordani Garcia has spanked it. But Cly is up now...</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>2.26am</strong> and he wins in 13.93 secs. the boy Clay is looking good for gold...</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>2.28am</strong> If an email which has just landed at Guardian towers is anything to go by, the medals-war between Britain and Austrlia continues to rage. It comes from Matthew Reilly and reads thus: \"I've noticed the guardian's medal table still has Australia on 36 in total \u2013 this needs to be updated to 38. That makes us only 2 behind Team GB on the Fox News medal tally (ie based on the total medal count which as we all know is right behind per capita gold medals as the true indication of Olympic success). And Australia still has at least 2 medal chances left (assuming the rest of the 4 x 400m relay teams drop their batons)\" Noted Matt, noted.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>2.30am</strong> Back to the BMX and time for the second-round of the women's semi-finals....</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>2.31am</strong> Chausson wins again, indeed the first four are the same first-four from the first round. Like the Premier League, this is becoming all too predictable. We need Tottenham, or in this case Sammy Cools, to end the tedium</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>2.34am</strong> Ok, time for Reade again. Can she stay on her bike this time....</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>2.36am</strong> Yes! Shanaze not only stayed up-right but also finished in 2nd. That's two points in the bag and puts her in 9th place with one ride to go.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>2.38am</strong> Reader's fifth overall in the second-heat with the top-four going through to the final</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>2.42am</strong> Kamakazi is up again...</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>2.44am</strong> ...and he's no where! Predictably, the race was won by the current world champion Strombergs. It's two wins in two for the Latvian with one more run to go.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>2.49am</strong> Back to the Birds Nest where Britain's Daniel Awde did will in his hurdles heat, finishing in second place. Slowly, but surely the pain of Dean Macey's retirement is fading. Do not get too excited though, Awde is in 24th place. Putting the boot in, Colin Jackson is now having a pop at Awde's hurdling technique. \"Jack of all trades...\" and all that.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>2.55am</strong> The 50km walk is going on at the moment. What a contrast to the hectic brilliance of the BMX, these guys look like they need a wee but can't find a toilet. Not so much riveting as it is...painful.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>2.59am</strong> Thankfully the BMX is back. Run three in the women's first semi-final is about to begin. Wonder if these lot have a little bell on their bike like I did. Probably not</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>3.02am</strong> Chausson makes it three wins out of three. She looks shattered again...</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>3.05am</strong> Walker, Diaz and Cools are also into the final. Can Reade join them there, we're about to find out...</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3.08am</strong> Reade wins!! Oh yes!! It's 1966 all over again, but better!</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3.09am</strong> Reade's time is the fastest of the women's competition so far. What a battle we're in for when the 19-year-old takes on Chausson in about 30 minutes time</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>3.11am</strong> As the men's semi-finals come to a conclusion, Will from Sydney expresses his disbelief at how Kamakaze's medal-challenge has \"gone down in flames\". Do I detect some sarcasm there Will?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>3.15am</strong> Kamakazi is up now....</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>3.17am</strong> He finishes a decent fourth, three places behind the imperious Strombergs who comfortably secures his place in the men's final</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>3.20am</strong> Look out, its beach volleyball time. Brazil's Ricardo Santos and Emanuel Rego are taking on Georgia's Brazilian pair of Renato Gomes and Jorge Terceiro. It's 19-14 to the Brazilians...Santos and Rego in case you're wondering.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>3.27am</strong> Set point for the current Olympic champions....</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>3.28am</strong> Rego smashes it over the net to take the bronze. A bronze in beach volleyball...now that's a c.v winner if ever I've seen one</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>3.30am</strong> BMX final time. A win for Reade, the favourite coming into these Games, will change her life forever. She'll become a dame, then be named BBC Sports Personality of the year and, most significantly of all, appear on Superstars with Lee Sharpe. Wow</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>3.34am</strong> Reade down! Reade down! No!!!!!!!</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>3.35am</strong> Her wheel clipped Chausson's back-wheel as the pair went for the line. She's hurt her arm, shattered our dreams and left Sharpe hanging. Disaster</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>3.37am</strong> Got to give credit to Chausson, one top rider. Reade will beat her in 2012 though, definitely. The sand dunes of Stratford WILL be hers.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>3.40am</strong> No time to dwell on what might have been...it's time for the men's final.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>3.44am</strong> No upset; Strombergs wins in 30.190 seconds.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>3.44am</strong> No upset; Strombergs wins in 30.190 seconds.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>3.45am</strong> Stromberg's victory means Latvia has its first ever Olympic gold medal in cycling. They'll be doing wheelies in the streets of Riga tonight</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>3.50am</strong> Discus time in the men's decathlon and Clay is looking awesome. He's thrown 53.79m, the longest distance in Olympic decathlon-discus history.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>3.59am</strong> Shanaze Reade says she \"put everything\" into the BMX final, including her \"heart and soul\". She's hurt her arms, legs and back but has vowed to return in four years time. What a legend, what a sport.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>4.02am</strong> The men's beach volleyball final kicks off. Another Brazilian pair are in action; Marcio Araujo and Fabio Magalhaes, and they're taking on Philip Dalhausser and Todd Rogers of the United States.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>4.08am</strong> The Brazilians were storming but the Americans have brought it back to 3-7.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>4.09am</strong> A mix-up on the serve-return, or \"dig\", puts the Brazilians 9-3 up</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>4.12am</strong> It's gone quiet on the email front here at Guardian towers. Come on readers, where are ya!</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>4.13am</strong> Oh by the way, they're taking a little sit-down in the volleyball. It's 10-9 to the Brazilian team, victory may just make up for the awful performance of the national football team. Or perhaps not.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>4.18am</strong> I do wonder how the track and field athletes react to the beach volleyball guys when they all sit down for dinner in the Olympic Village. <br>\"What did you do today?\"<br>\"Oh I ran 1500 meters in searing heat and breath-sapping humidity. You?\"<br>\"I was on the beach, playing volleyball\"<br>Cue awkward silence</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>4.22am</strong> Have to admit, this is actually quite exciting. It's now 17-17. That Dalhausser is huge, A ball-slapping giant. He's apparently 6ft 9ins tall.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>4.27am</strong> Crickey, its set-point USA.....</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>4.29am</strong> Dalhausser serves at 21-20 but Fabio pushes it back to make it 21-21. The Americans have dropped two set points and now have to receive serve</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>4.30am</strong> They survive, get a third set point and after Fabio can only hit the ball into the net, win the first set. Cracking stuff, honest.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>4.31am</strong> In other Olympic news, Alex Schwazer, from Italy, wins gold in the men's 50km walk and 17-year-old Aaron Cooke, from Manchester, progresses through to the next round of today's taekwondo competition. That continues later</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>4.35am</strong> The beach volleyball is underway. It's 5-3 to the Brazilians in the second set. Could this be the sport's very own Federer v Nadal?</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>4.37am</strong> Right then, Charlie from typhoon-hit Hong Kong wants to know if the Philippines has even won an Olympic medal. I'm too busy watching my new favourite sport beach volleyball to check so does anyone else know the answer?</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>4.41am</strong> This from Pommie Barsteward in Far North Queensland: \"Does any one know what the chances are of the Russians passing us in the medal table? If we finish third it would be great but a fourth would still be creditable. Personally speaking, as long we finish above the Aussies I'll be more than happy.\" I hear that Pommie</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>4.42am</strong> Nathan, did your girlfriend watch Christine Ohuruogu win 400m gold on Tuesday? She didn't seem to be sitting down to me.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>4.45am</strong> Another sit-down in the volleyball. They're back and it's 12-10 to the US. You can cut the tension with a plastic spade</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>4.49am</strong> Three points in a row brings Brazil back into this. It's 14-14 and the public address DJ is playing Song 2 by Blur. The Olympics do not get better than this</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>4.51am</strong> Some great work at the net by Fabio puts Brazil 17-5 up in the second set. A poor return by Dalhausser makes it 18-15 and, not surprisingly, the US guys call a time-out. They're rattled.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>4.55am</strong> Harry has wade into the Britain verses Australia medals debate. \"Surely with a comparable GDP but three times the population of Australia, anything less than three times the medals means Oz wins? I mean apples with apples please,\" he says</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>4.56am</strong> Back to the more important battle and Brazil take the second set 21-17. We're going to have a third set to decide who wins gold. What drama</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>4.57am</strong> Kevin informs us that \"the Philippines have never won gold, their best is two silvers in boxing.\" Thanks Kevin, sadly I cannot publish your final comment as its ever so slightly offensive.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>5.01am</strong> It's 3-0 to the US in the volleyball</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>5.06am</strong> After a shaky display at the end of the previous set, Dalhausser is back to his imperious best. Great serving and even better blocking have seen him and Rogers go 9-2 up in the final set</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>5.10am</strong> 14-10 to the US. They're on gold-medal point...</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>5.11am</strong> USA WIN BEACH VOLLEYBALL GOLD</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>5.12am</strong> A net-block by 'the beast' Dalhausser has given the US their third men's beach volleyball gold and a clean sweep at these games after the American women also took gold. Michael Phelps move-over, there's some new heroes in town</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>5.15am</strong> Pommie's fighting back: \"GB has 311 odd athletes in Beijing while Australia has over 482. Does Harry care to work out the medal winning ratio on that basis? Can I hear the sound of a pin dropping?\"</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>5.18am</strong> Back to the Birds Nest where Daniel Awde throws 37.12 in the decathlon-discus and with it, moves down to 28th in the placings. Oh dear</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>5.20am</strong> Aaron Cooke, our big taekwondo hope, was inspired to take up the sport after watching the Power Rangers. I was inspired to take up not-watching-television after watching the Power Rangers</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>5.25am </strong> Having beaten Anju Jason from the Marshall Islands 7-0 earlier on, Cooke will take on Venezuela's Carlos Carvajal Vasquez later</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>5.28am</strong> Harry fights back: \"Team GB are at liberty to send 482 competitors if they wish; Australia cannot find another 40 million population to pick from. As an Irish Kiwi I'd like to paraphrase Henry Kissinger and wish you would both lose.\" Game on</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>5.32am</strong> And this from Mike: \"Here in Perth it's quite hard to find out exactly what Team GB is winning because the Aussie TV broadcasters DON'T SHOW ANY OF IT. They've given us barely a minute of the track cycling, every Brit's new favourite sport, choosing instead to show anything with the slightest flash of green and gold. Thankfully a medal table is never far away though, which is pretty satisfying.\"</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>5.34am</strong> Clearly fired-up by the messages which have been coming into Guardian towers, the Australian women's hockey team has just beaten their British counterparts 2-0. Sadly for the Aussies, there was no medal to play for, instead they finished fifth overall.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>5.47am</strong> Don't forget that Tom Daley and Peter Waterfield are competing in the men's 10m platform preliminary later today.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>5.51am</strong> It's getting spicy in the Britain v Australia medals war of words. This from Pommie: \"If Harry would care to calculate the gold medal totals of Aus, NZ and Ireland and lump them all together he'll find it still doesn't come close to GB. And I'd like to paraphrase that great icon of Irish Australian culture at its best; Paul Hogan as Crocodile Dundee:<br>'You call that an Olympic medal haul? THIS is an Olympic medal haul!'\"</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>5.59am</strong> Tim Brabants is also in the canoe later on. Could well be another gold for Team GB, what would the Aussies think of that I wonder...</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>6am</strong> The IOC is investigating the possibility that members of China's gold-medal winning gymnastics team are under the age of 16 and therefore ineligible to compete at these Games. It is believed that He Kexin, who won gold on the uneven bars, may only be 14.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>6.01am</strong> Katy Livingstone and Heather Fell are in modern pentathlon action later on too....</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>6.06am</strong> No retort as yet from Harry....</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>6.16am</strong> Harry's back: \"Golds: GB has 17 and Oz and NZ combined have 14. Pommie may say that 14 is nowhere near 17 but most wouldn't. But the combined populations of the three countries (less than 30 million) are nowhere near the 60 million GB has. Team GB need to be on 28 golds to even equal the efforts of the tri-nations.\" Fact-tastic</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>6.22am</strong> Bad news folks; Harry's off. The proud Kiwi has just informed me that he's going for a beer at O'Carrolls in Auckland. But in an attempt to make piece, he added: \"I'll buy Pommiebarsteward one if he cares to join me.\" We wait to see if Pommie takes up the offer....</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>6.48am</strong> Pommie has also decided to do a Paul McCartney and let it be: \"Tell Harry that mine's a gin and tonic and I'm happy to call it a draw for the sake of international relations,\" he said. Well ain't that nice</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>6.50am</strong> A good point from Steve Spencer: \"Why is the British diver Tom Daley allowed to compete at 14 but not the gymnasts?\" I don't know Steve. In regards to your second question, I don't think alcohol can ever be described as a performance enhancing drug.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>7.09am</strong> Don't worry Catherine, you're not missing anything....</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>7.19am</strong> For those suffering from Olympic-event withdrawal symptoms, it's 13-12 to Russia in their indoor volleyball match against the United States. USA lead two sets to one. Apparently it has been decided that if Russia lose this one, they have to get out of Georgia. If America lose, they have to get out of everywhere else</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>7.30am</strong> It's now 23-20 to the Russians</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>7.33am</strong> it's two-sets all between Russia and the United States. Georgia looks on...</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>7.58am</strong> Not since Italia'90 has there been as much excitement about an England v Ireland tussle. James DeGale will shortly take on Darren Sutherland in one of the middleweight boxing semi-finals. The loser is guaranteed a bronze medal but no doubt both fighters will be going for gold. They have met five times before with Sutherland coming out on top on four of those occasions.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>8.02am</strong> This from Max: \"Having listened to the Jamaican national anthem a few times recently - does anybody else think it should be a bit more fun?</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>8.04am</strong> USA beat Russia to set up a gold-medal meeting with either Italy or Brazil. Could it be yet another volleyball triumph for the Americans?</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>8.07am</strong> Well it's been a fun six hours or so but that's it from me. I'm now handing over to Howard \"the killa\" Swains (sorry, i'm gripped by boxing fever). Enjoy folks.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>8.13am:</strong> Textbook takeover, there. We're slap bang in the middle of the middleweight semi-final boxing between James DeGale and Darren Sutherland. The Brit DeGale leads 3-1 at the end of the second round.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>8.16am:</strong> DeGale is well on top here, and takes a 8-2 lead at the end of the third round. \"It's like the bull and the matador at the moment. All DeGale needs is a cape,\" commentates the commentator, whose name got lost in our seemless transition. A cape on these boxing suits would mean one thing: Superman.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>8.18am: Boxing:</strong> Sutherland's only hope in this last round is a knockout; DeGale leads by far too far. After a massive dressing down during the round break from his corner man Terry Edwards (I'm sure the trumpet player the the Bad Seeds was called Terry Edwards - I'm thinking it's a different one), DeGale knows he just has to keep his cool in this last round to upgrade bronze to silver at least.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>8.20am: Boxing: </strong>DeGale bosses the early stages, then walks on to a hefty one from Sutherland. It rocks the Brit, but he sees out the final 23 seconds to take the bout 10-3. He's through to the final.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>8.22am: Boxing: James DeGale wins middleweight (75kg) semi-final and goes through to final.</strong> That's at least a silver for the Hammersmith Hammer.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>8.24am: Boxing: </strong>\"That's the way he plays. He's a runner. I'm a fighter,\" says sore loser, Darren Sutherland. \"I'm not a sore loser. I hope he goes on a wins gold,\" he adds, at just the right moment. James DeGale gets all excited: \"I just wanna hear my national anthem. I'll cry. I swear.\"</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>8.27am: Kayaking:</strong> Yes. It's the good doctor, Tim Brabants in the final of the K1 1,000m, from the lake. Brabants, who really <em>is</em> a doctor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.olympicscanoeingandkayaking\">chatted to Small Talk</a> earlier in the week, and why not take a quick peek at that as they paddle a bit before the big off. You've got two minutes.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>8.31: Kayaking:</strong> Holy canoe. They're off. Brabants flew out of the blocks (or whatever) and leads at the 250m mark from the huge Canadian beside him. The two of them are way ahead of the rest.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>8.32am: Kayaking:</strong> Some terrific rotation from the good doctor, according to Helen Reeves in the commentary box. Who seems to know. Brabants leads at the half-way stage from the big Canadian.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>8.33am: Kayaking:</strong> \"Has Tim gone too soon?\" That's the fear as the defending Olympic champion, a Norwegian called Laursen, comes up on the outside. But no, he hasn't. He's timed it perfectly, and Tim Brabants holds on to take gold. \"That's wonderful paddling,\" wheezes Gary Herbert.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>8.34am: Tim Brabants wins gold for Team GB!GB!GB! in the men's 1,000m K1 kayak</strong></p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>8.37am: </strong>Wow. Sachin sits here all night and watches our main medal hope eat BMX track dirt; I'm here for ten minutes, and that's a gold and silver. Just call me Midas. Next up, we've surely got a tearful medal ceremony for the good doctor Brabants, then, well, something else. I'll find out. \"Did James DeGale really declare that he trained for four years, and then fought his way to the final of an Olympic boxing tournament because \"I just wanna hear my national anthem\"?\" wonders Will Sinclair. \"Surely there is an easier way? Just buy the CD for God's sake, man!\" Well, he did say other stuff in his interview, but I think that was his main motivation. It is a corker.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>8.40am:</strong> \"Surely James DeGale is a shoo-in for Sports Personality, if the Beeb can take the 'Personality' aspect of the award into account,\" says Andrew Moore. Nigel Mansell, Nick Faldo, Jonny Wilkinson, etc. \"Personality\" has scarcely been necessary, Andrew.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>8.43am:</strong> I don't want this to put you off our newest gold medallist, but the last album Tim Brabants bought was by Coldplay. How do I know this? Because I've just read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.olympicscanoeingandkayaking\">his SmallTalk interview with the good doctor, which you can also do by clicking the blue</a>.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>8.48am:</strong> \"Taekwondo now,\" murmurs Adrian Chiles, twirling a pen and looking sheepish. I can's say I'm up for that, so it's more boxing. It's the other semi-final in the middleweight division on one of these wonderful internet feeds, and it's a Russian versus a Cuban. Oh, actually this is a heavyweight bout, so scrap that.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>8.56am: Taekwondo:</strong> OK, a little bit of Taekwondo. The Beeb is showing a repeat of Aaron Cooke's defeat of Anju Jason earlier in the day. The Brit thrashed him seven to zip, and a seven-point lead is good enough to end any Taekwondo bout, post Athens, as you know. He's into the quarter finals, where he'll fight Carlos Vasquez Carvajal, from Venezuela, for a shot at a medal.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>8.58am:</strong> It's another one of those 9am lulls at the Games, when we get load of repeats, hours of bluster about the British medal tally, and, yep, beach volleyball. Later on, though, everyone's favourite 14-year-old scapegoat Tom Daley dives. This time he's by himself, so he can't ruin everything for everyone else, like he did last time. There's also David Price in the boxing ring, but that's hours away.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>9.02am: Taekwondo</strong> Lull, what lull. Here it is, this is Aaron Cooke in the quarter final of the welterweight taekwondo. And now I'm crazy about it, especially as Cook took a 2-0 lead within the first minute.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>9.03am: Taekwondo:</strong> That's 3-0 to Cook at the end of the first round against the Venezuelan. Apparently the Power Rangers got the young Cook involved with taekwondo.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>9.06am: Taekwondo: </strong>Vasquez picks up his first point, then gets a half-point penalty for stepping onto the yellow outside the ring. But, yowsers, Cook throws what looked to the untrained eye like one hell of a kick that connects with Vasquez's head and gets two points for Cook. He's leading 5-1 at the end of the second round, of three.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>9.09am: Taekwondo: </strong><strong> Aaron Cook </strong>has just kicked his way into the semi-final of the taekwondo and is now guaranteed a fight for the bronze at least. He's a 17-year-old from Manchester, in case you're wondering, and he thrashed that Venezuelan.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>9.13am:</strong> \"In the diving, Tom Daley has it easy, as it's really just jumping into water isn't it?\" You know better than that, Gary Naylor. \"Most other jumping events (long jump, ski jump etc) use length (or length plus style marks) as the criteria for victory, so why not in the pool? Seeing someone charge along the 10 metre platform then jump as far out as possible into the water would be great fun. Style marks could be awarded for tightest bomb or best use of flailing limbs.\" Some day, someone will host this alternative Olympics.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>9.15am:</strong> In case you missed it, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/22/olympics2008.olympicscanoeingandkayaking\">Tim Brabants won gold for GB in this morning's 1,000m K1 kayaking.</a></p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>9.19am:</strong> \"Here in Hong Kong we're right slap bang in the middle of the eye of Typhoon Nuri,\" says Tim Maitland, in an Olympics-free email, but an email nonetheless. \"It's totally calm. The dragonflies have come out (as has next door's maid). Within half an hour it'll be like Armageddon!\" Feisty one, is she?</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>9.24am: </strong>Germany wins gold in the women's K4 500m kayaking, which is one hell of a race. Four people in a boat windmilling in a straight line. Terrific stuff. Meanwhile, Paul Harman is a Brit who lives and works in the Netherlands: I am a Brit who lives and works in the Netherlands,\" he confirms. \"In this Olympic Games the Netherlands team is doing pretty well so far - 15 medals including 6 golds - but the story that they're all rather smugly enjoying is this: \"Belgium Null Points\". Belgium's medal tally so far:<br>Golds: 0<br>Silvers: 0<br>Bronzes: 0<br>Total: 0<br>There's every chance now that Belgium will pull out a big fat duck for the whole Games - Yikes!!\"</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>9.29am:</strong> I can't help but advise you to read something other than this at the moment, so how about: <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/22/olympics20083\">The Beijinger: our daily email from the Games.</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.olympicscanoeingandkayaking\">Small Talk's paddle with Team GB!GB!GB!'s latest gold medallist Tim Brabants</a><br><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/22/phelps_is_within_spitzing_dist.html\">Harry Pearson on Michael Phelps</a><br>or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/22/olympics2008?picture=336856494\">Some loverly pictures</a></p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>9.40am:</strong> Somewhere in China, Britain's modern pentathletes are into the horsey section of that particular running, swimming, sword-fighting, shooting, riding discipline. Heather Fell was doing pretty well, second after the swim, but there don't seem to be any pictures from this, so who knows how she's going now.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>9.44am: </strong>My fledgling taekwondo knowledge is stretched to its fullest to bring you this: I think there's good news for <strong>Aaron Cook</strong> in that he's due to fight the Italian Mauro Sarmiento in the semi-final. Sarmiento beat the American Steven Lopez in his quarter final, and Lopez is the reigning Olympic champion, who also won gold in Sydney.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>9.55am:</strong> Some facts about our latest Olympic hero Aaron Cook, who has a semi-final fight in the taekwondo later on. He was the Cadet European Champion in 2005, won bronze at the world junior Games in 2006, then won gold this year. <a href=\"http://www.olympics.org.uk/beijing2008/AthleteProfile.aspx?id=6443\">It's all here if you want to read it.</a></p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>9.57am:</strong> \"When it comes to the alternative Olympics,\" says Tom Miles, as if continuing a discussion we had in the pub last night. \"I am rather hoping to see a no-holds barred attempt to beat all the records at the conventional games \u2013 that man with the carbon fibre legs versus [name removed by spineless reporter fearful of Guardian legal department] and his/her cocktail of drugs, perhaps competing against someone who has been genetically modified with cheetah implants and someone else with prototype Wallace n Gromit rocket legs that may or may not explode on the start line. Original, guaranteed records and \u2013 best of all- no one could cheat. Wouldn't that be more fun?\" It certainly would be more fun that what's happening at the moment, which is some table-tennis, some taekwondo, some kayak medal ceremonies, and eff all else.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>10.03am:</strong> Joanne Harris has lifted some of this mid-morning gloom: \"Kia ora from New Zealand,\" she begins, which sends me scuttling off to Wikipedia and the knowledge that everyone's favourite source of childhood hyperactivity and e-numbers is actually a Maori greeting meaning 'Be well and healthy'. \"Regarding the taekwondo, does Cook get a bronze regardless because he made the semis (like the boxers)?\" No, he doesn't unfortunately. He gets to fight for a spot in the final, where it's gold or silver, and if he loses, he gets to fight the other defeated semi-finallists for the one bronze medal. I'm not sure how come the surfeit of bronze medals doesn't extend from the boxing hall to the taekwondo hall, but I don't make the rules.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>10.07am:</strong> Martyn Kingsbury has been firewalled: \"Why when I was just looking forward to sitting down and <a href=\"http://www.olympics.org.uk/beijing2008/AthleteProfile.aspx?id=6443#\">reading your blog about Aaron Cook</a> did you decide to supply it on a web page that my company feels is an un-acceptable address?\" No idea, Martyn, but it'll probably surprise you to learn that it wasn't even a blog. It was just the Team GB!GB!GB! website and unless your company blocks wanton jingoism or unseemly pictures of Sir Clive Woodward, there's nothing on there to worry about.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>10.13am: Modern pentathlon: </strong> Right, finally there's a feed to the modern pentathlon, where Britain's <strong>Heather Fell</strong> was in second place after the third-of-five-events, the swimming. It's the show jumping section now, where Fell has apparently picked a real old nag to ride (not her fault - there's a lottery for what horse you get). This is a first for all of us, I expect. But it's show-jumping all the way from here.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>10.19am: Modern pentathlon: </strong> OK, show-jumping then. Show-jumping. In the words of minute-by-minute heavyweight Scott Murray: \"Has it really come to this?\" Belinda Schreiber, from Switzerland, is off at the moment, on a horse called GuangGuang. \"I'm going to take a wild prediction,\" says the commentator. \"Go on then,\" says the other one. \"This is going to be dreadful.\" Good-o.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>10.23am:</strong> Schreiber \"loses her right stirrup\" and I lose my internet connection. Then I get back online and they've lost a horse in the show jumping arena, where really no one seems to have a clue what's going on, which makes me feel very comfortable. Schreiber's ride was actually pretty good, apparently, although I'm not sure what that means in the overall standings. Rest assured, this shambles will get sorted out soon. Or not.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>10.28am: Modern pentathlon: </strong>Jane Marques, from Brazil, loses her <em>left</em> stirrup, but still completes the course. She was sixth overall before that ride, but will drop down. The Ukrainian Tereshuk is out next, and she was fifth overall before this, which leads me to believe that they may be coming out in order. That means Fell will be out soon-ish.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>10.30am: Taikwondo: </strong>Joshua Nealon wants to know \"Why is it a GOOD thing that our boy Aaron Cook has to fight a guy who just beat the crap out of the reigning double Olympic champion? Surely the Italian Sarmiento is going to be hard as nails, no???\" We'll find out right now. The bout has started.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>10.32am:</strong> This, ladies and gentleman, is versatility. Aaron Cook is currently fighting Sarmiento in the taekwondo semi-final, and the modern pentathletes are currently show-jumping. I'm trying to cover both. At the end of the first round in the taekwondo, Cook is 2-1 down to the Italian, but can count himself unlucky. He should have had a point, it seemed, near to the end of the round, but it wasn't given.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>10.34am: Taekwondo and modern pentathlon:</strong> Kick, point. Kick back, point. Kick from the Brit. Point! Two-one in that round of the taekwondo, meaning it's 3-3 with one round left. Heather Fell is now out in the modern pentathlon show-jumping and she's going great guns as well. In fact, hold the back page, she only hits two fences, which is brilliant, and she moves into gold medal position!</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>10.37am: Taekwondo and modern pentathlon:</strong> Only a German and a horse called ZhingZhing stands between Heather Fell and the first place after the show-jumping. In the taekwondo, both fighters score two points, bringing it to 5-5 but -- disaster! -- in the final second, Sarmiento gets a kick in and takes it 6-5. Cook is in tears.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>10.39am:</strong> Huge disappointment for <strong>Aaron Cook</strong>, who will now fight for the bronze medal only after that last-second point for Sarmiento in the taekwondo. Better news in the modern pentathlon, where <strong>Heather Fell</strong> will start the final, medal-deciding 3,000m run in second place.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>10.45am:</strong> The way this modern pentathlon works, and which I've known all along, of course, is that you get a whole load of points for the first four events, which are tabulated and then decide who starts in what order, and by how many seconds, in the final 3,000m run. Heather Fell, who is a very strong runner, will start 19 seconds behind Lena Schoneborn, of Germany, when they go off later today. She has genuine chances of a medal. Not that man-of-the-people Gary Naylor would be impressed: \"Modern Pentathlon comprises fencing, shooting, swimming, show jumping, and cross-country running. So it's pretty much a competition about being posh. No wonder the Brits do well in it. Replace the swimming and running with \"getting your child into the right prep school\" and \"4x4 urban driving\" and we'd win the gold in perpetuity.\"</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>10.49am:</strong> OK folks, Scott Murray's here to take you through to the end of the day. Thanks for your emails, sorry I couldn't use most of them, but keep them coming. Scott's on <a href=\"mailto:scott.murray@theguardian.com\">scott.murray@theguardian.com</a></p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>10.55am:</strong> Good morning to you, and what's going on here, then. Ah yes, it's the semi-final of the volleyball. I thought the USA had won gold in this earlier on today, but by all accounts that's a completely different sport as it was played on the beach and there were less people involved. This is the semi-final of the men's indoor event between the USA and Russia, and at the moment the Russians are treating the ball with the sort of disdain they are currently showing Nato, hammering it around with their fists like billy-o. It's 7-7 in the final set. Is that what you say? Bump, set, spike, bump, set, spike.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>11.03am:</strong> Now it's 12-12. Oh me, oh my. Now then, I have no idea what any of you have been talking about, so this will either be a seamless segue or, more likely, a clunking left-turn way off piste, but here goes. \"I find it a bit rich Sir Clive Woodward taking on the lead role for elite performance,\" opines Colin Huxtable, apoplectic that nobody at the BOA appears to know what has happened to Southampton FC in the last couple of years. \"I found myself imbibing a mojito or two beside him in Antigua last year during the Cricket World Cup and I think its fair to say the man is not averse to the odd pie or fifteen. I just hope he isn't advocating his own dietary regime to our elite athletes.\"</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>11.08am:</strong> Ah the States have won it. I would tell you the score in the final set - 15-something - but the BBC left the event as the Americans cavorted with indecent haste, almost as if they couldn't care less about it. Imagine. In other news, that drug-addled Ukranian has been stripped of her silver in the heptathlon.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>11.15am:</strong> \"What's the deal Scott?\" asks Claire Gordon. I'm sensing rancour. \"Howard says the lead is 19 secs, your rival at the BBC says 9 secs.\" What lead? Er... eh... ah, that one. OK, I think Schoneborn's lead over Fell is <em>[MBM reporter logs onto BBC website - they're not <strong>my</strong> rivals, I pay my licence fee]</em> nine seconds. No, it actually is 19 seconds, that's what Howard told me. Do you miss Howard? I miss Howard too.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>Class War with theguardian.com/sport and Gary Naylor:</strong> What's Naylor been saying about the modern pentathlon? Nayyyyloooorrrrr!!! \"Modern Pentathlon is based upon the skills of 19th century British soldiers,\" replies Hong Kong Charlie. \"In other words, shooting, sword fighting / fencing, swimming, horse riding and running. Had Naylor not attended such a scummy comprehensive where the students pierce each other's council flats, you might have known that.\" Eh? What the hell are you talking about? \"Is it just me or do some people think every sport is 'posh'?\" adds Charlie Howard. \"Since when were swimming and running elitist, and does the art of shooting people really qualify you as a toff? Maybe they should have an anti-posh equivalent of the modern pentathlon? Comprising stabbing, boxing, running (away from police cars), talking like Darren Campbell, and hunt sabotaging.\" Great idea. Though maybe we could replace a couple of your events with Wresting The Means Of Production From The Bourgeoisie and Putting People Called Charlie First Up Against The Wall Come The Revolution.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>11.27pm:</strong> The last event of the modern pentathlon - a modern pentathlon for everyone, people, let's pull together, first class for all - will commence at roughly 1pm UK time.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>Thank you, my theguardian.com/sport!</strong> \"Fantastic effort with the volleyball, Scott,\" writes Xan Perez Perez. Thanks, Xan. \"Shame that it came a bit late. BBC MBM coverage gave us the USA-Russia volleyball result at 7.54am. You are just three hours and a half late.\" It's part of our ersatz charm. Anyway, I blame the BBC for not putting one of those \"live\" flashes in the corner of their screen. Stiffed by The Man! Naylor won't like this. That's it, I'm turning to Eurosport.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>11.34pm:</strong> What's this on Eurosport? It's live, I can tell you that for nothing. A channel for the people. I'm not sure what this is. A load of Europeans are on an indoor court throwing a ball about into nets. It's like water polo without the water and extreme violence. I think it might be called Throwing Game.</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>11.35pm:</strong> Throwing Game is in fact called Handball. And France are 12-11 up with a minute of the \"first\" remaining.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>11.36pm:</strong> Croatia have just missed a penalty in Throwing Game. What happens is, their best Throwing Man makes to throw the ball at the keeper's face a couple of times, like a schoolground bully, then tries to bounce it off the floor and under Keeps as he makes a star jump. It's a clever move to get past the netminder, but sadly when the ball springs back off the floor, it brushes the underside of the French keeper's front tail and somehow spins onto the bar. Keeper claws it away, shouts a lot, and it's 12-11 at half time to France. Knocks John Terry v Edwin van der Sar into a cocked hat. Actually, no it doesn't. Where's the state broadcaster?</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>11.43am</strong> We're in a lull, folks. Alright, I'm in a lull. The BBC are currently broadcasting a montage of modern pentathletes being flung over fences made of polystyrene bricks by their horses. It's like a cross between You've Been Framed and It's A Knockout. So, It's A Knockout, then. \"I've always liked the fact that the Modern Pentathlon - a test of a soldier's skills - puts the run last, tacitly acknowledging that after an almighty scrap the best option is to peg it,\" writes Simon Thomas. \"If this was the Daily Mail MBM, I'd stick in a gag about the Italians dominating the event but we're above that.\" We're above something at last! It's only taken the best part of a decade.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>Class War with theguardian.com/sport and Gary Naylor:</strong> \"Hong Kong Charlie is right about the Modern Pentathlon being based on the skills of a 19th century British soldier - an officer,\" writes Naylor (<a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Karl_Marx.jpg\">pictured here</a>). \"If it were based on the life of a squaddie, it would comprise: being shouted at; forcing pay out of reluctant quartermasters; getting by on half-rations; wearing cheap, unsuitable clothing; and not sharing in the proceeds of Empire.\"</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>11.50 am</strong> The handball has started again. I don't even know if this is the semi-final, the final, or what. I should really find out for you, shouldn't I. Give me a sec. (It's now 13-13 after two minutes of the second period, by the way. Croatia must have had the mother of all rollockings at the break.)</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>11.52 am</strong> It's the semi-final, and Bertrand Gille has just thrown one in! Yes, he has thrown it in. France go 14-13 up with that stunner, though I have to admit I am struggling to either understand or become animated about this. The only other option is watching the modern pentathletes gad around on their horses again, but Howard's already covered that, so what's left?</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>Midday brawl:</strong> It's 16-16 in Throwing Game now, but to hell with that, because Paddy Barnes of Ireland has started flinging his fists around in the aggressive manner; it's the semi-final of the light-flyweight discipline. The 21-year-old is guaranteed a bronze... but can he make the final? The first round doesn't go too well, as he's hit upside his head twice by China's Zou Shiming to go 2-0 down.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>12.05pm:</strong> This is a bit of a rout. Zou is 6-0 up. Barnes has failed to land a single punch in nearly two rounds of boxing. And he's slapped about another couple of times before the bell; that's 8-0. Oh dear.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>12.10pm:</strong> This is a shafting alright - it's now 11-0 after the third - though the judges aren't even bothering to hide their obvious bias for the host competitor. Admittedly Barnes should be about five or six points down, but he has now landed a couple of punches which have not been recorded, while Zou just picked one up for wiping his armpit across the back of Barnes's neck. It's a bit of a farce, really, and it needn't even be like that.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>12.15pm:</strong> Zou was very impressive and a deserved winner, but there was no way that was a 15-0 scoreline. Barnes doesn't look best pleased with the judges - as he walks out of the arena, one official puts a hand on his shoulder and is told in no uncertain terms to do one - and no wonder. Still, he takes a bronze home with him.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>12.18pm:</strong> Barnes has just given a post-bout interview as unequivocal as they come.</p> <p>A LIVID BARNES: \"There's no question I lost the fight, but the judges were a disgrace. They should be docked points ... this is the worst country in the world, they shouldn't even be hosting the Games.\"<br>CRAVEN BBC INTERVIEWER GARY RICHARDSON, AUDIBLY SHAKING AT THE PROSPECT OF GETTING HIS PRESS PASS TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM, AND DOING HIS BEST TO LOSE THE NEWS: <em>(cheerily)</em> \"Well, you won a medal at least!\"<br>BARNES: \"I don't care. They can keep it for all I care.\"</p> <p>[exeunt BARNES and RICHARDSON'S CREDIBILITY]</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>12.25pm:</strong> France are in the final of Throwing Game, they must be, they're 25-22 up with less than a minute to go. I'll be going to Tom Daley at the 10m platform diving in a minute, but let's face it he's not going to win. Anyway, at his age he should be bombing and getting shouted at by the lifeguard for heavy petting.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>12.28pm:</strong> And that's it. Croatia pull a goal, if that's what it's called, back, but France prevail 25-23 and will face either Spain or Iceland in Throwing Game Denouement Game.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>12.33pm:</strong> Daley is struggling in the diving; he doesn't look like qualifying in the top 18. He's 23rd at present, after the first round. Jade Johnson has started the long jump final and posted 6.51m with her first jump, but she's got a long way to go if she wants to beat Maggi of Brazil, who has opened with 7.04m. \"In the midst of all this mesmerising and frankly disconcerting British success it's good to see that some traditions remain,\" writes Steve Johnson. \"Reading the Taekwondo updates on this very site I was struck by just how very British Aaron Cook is: decent, gutsy performance. Done by a dodgy ref. Defeated in heart-breaking fashion right at the death. All he has to do now is repeat it in the bronze medal bout to finish fourth after being within a whisker of fighting for the gold and THAT is British sporting endeavour at its finest.\"</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>12.40pm:</strong> The semi-final of the women's 4x400m is off. The British team were miles in front after Nicola Saunders' first leg, and now it's Kelly Sotherton. Oh dear.</p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>12.42pm:</strong> There's a minor panic at the end of the race. Christine Ohuruogu ambles round and is nearly pipped for third place by the German runner. She puts in a spurt right at the end to ensure qualification for the final, but that was dicing with death; Britain were a hair's breadth from going out there. That wasn't a very clever run, but at least she remembered to turn up for the race.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>12.46pm:</strong> Aaron Cook has just started his bid for bronze in Kicking Game. His Chinese opponent Zhu Guo gives him a boot up the jacksie to go one up, but Cooke responds by walloping him upside his head. That should have been two points but... you know the way this is going. Let's hope Gary Richardson isn't doing the post-bout interview.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>12.49pm:</strong> Cook is now on -1 points after conceding a couple of minor penalty scores for... there really is no point me trying to wing it, this is simply the way it is. Zhu is three ahead, on two points himself.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>12.52pm:</strong> A wee bit of a comeback from Cook; after a flurry of Way of the Exploding Fist style hoofing, it's now 3-1 to Zhu. Ah no, hold on, it's 4-1. I have no idea what is going on. Other than it's all over, and Zhu has the bronze medal. I get the impression we're in a Paddy Barnes situation here; Zhu was the better fighter - he certainly <em>looked</em> the more adroit, though as I say I know nowt - but Cook didn't get much out of the judges there.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>12.58pm:</strong> Brazil are currently beating Belgium 2-0 in the bronze medal football match; it's half-time there. Anyway, everyone, time to put your Jingohats on - it's the final discipline in the Modern Pentathlon, the 3,000m. Fell sets off 19 seconds behind Schoneborn, Katy Livingston a full minute behind her.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>1.04pm:</strong> Fell has picked up a whopping one second over the first 1,000m of her strongest event. Get a wriggle on, you won't be able to blame the judges for this.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>1.07pm:</strong> After the second 1,000m, Fell has closed to within 11 seconds. That poor first lap could cost her, a strong finish is what's needed here...</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>1.09pm:</strong> Schoneborn doesn't look like letting this slip, to be honest with you.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> And she doesn't. Fell takes silver, about 14 seconds behind Schoneborn. Nobody looks particularly excited about this, I have to say. None of them. A very low-key denouement after all that effort.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>1.13pm:</strong> Hold on, Fell has cracked a smile.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>1.15pm:</strong> Actually, she's properly happy now. Took a while, though.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p><strong>It's 12.18pm all over again:</strong> This time Aaron Cook has just given a post-bout interview as unequivocal as they come. \"I knew the crowd were going to be on his side, but the judges?\" he says, struggling and ultimately failing to hold back the tears. \"I've never known anything like it, I've never known scoring like it. I was making hits but nothing was going up. What do i have to do to score a point?\" And of course the BBC interviewer doesn't bother to press the point, suggesting \"ah well, at least you have a few lessons learned for 2012\".</p> <!-- Block 174 --> <p><strong>1.20pm:</strong> And with the news that Paddy Barnes is still on the meltdown - he has called for the boxing judges to be dope-tested - I'll take my leave and hand you back to Howard Swains (<a href=\"mailto:hswains@gmail.com\">hswains@gmail.com</a>). Thanks for all your emails, especially the ones about class war (no offence, Ms Fell).</p> <!-- Block 175 --> <p><strong>1.23pm:</strong> Hello again, and welcome to the end of the day, although I'm not really sure what I'm going to be describing to you: I kind of thought this was getting close to the end and that Scott was all over it anyway. It seems not.</p> <p>Actually, it looks like there's still some <strong>boxing</strong> to to get to grips with, with the big Price fella up in the monumental-weight division. And here's some relaying to kick off with, and those buttered batons.</p> <!-- Block 176 --> <p><strong>1.25pm: Athletics:</strong> This is the 4x400m relay and Great Britain are actually doing pretty well after three legs. They're leading, in fact, as Martyn Rooney takes over.</p> <!-- Block 177 --> <p><strong>1.26pm: Athletics:</strong> Remarkably comfortable run there from Martyn Rooney on the anchor leg and Great Britain coast into the final with a victory in the semi-finals. Jamaica and the Bahamas are second and third.</p> <!-- Block 178 --> <p><strong>1.29pm: Athletics:</strong> Dang, long jump too. Great Britain's Jade Johnson is first on my screen, although it's her second leap. She goes sailing 6.64m, and the commentator's hyperbole raises my spirits for a moment before they come crashing back down with the \"That'll keep her in seventh place\" kicker.</p> <!-- Block 179 --> <p><strong>1.33pm: </strong>\"I like all this throwing game/ kicking game stuff,\" says Richard Hamblin. That's Scott Murray for you, Richard. He's a wordsmith. \"Can we extend it? Sort of \"chasing each other round on bikes game\", \"synchronised baton dropping game\", \"cheated out of it by ridiculous homers game\" type of thing.\" Right now, there's the Patronising Scarlet-Haired Triple Jumpers game going on, as Colin Jackson attempts to console Phillips Idowu on his silver-medal-winning, letting-the-whole-country-down-failure for Britain yesterday. \"It's going in one ear and out the other,\" says Phillips, to earn all our envy.</p> <!-- Block 180 --> <p><strong>1.36pm:</strong> I've been in Oslo for about 10 years, and still can't get excited about throwing,\" says Marc Stevens. \"But I caught the last few minutes of yesterday's semi-final match between Norway and South Korea with the South Koreans refusing to acknowledge the last Norwegian goal and lodging an official complaint. <a href=\"http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/ol/spill/verdi/68843\">Brief highlights of the chaotic drama with Norwegian commentary here</a>.\" It's the Norwegian commentary that sold it.</p> <!-- Block 181 --> <p><strong>1.37pm: Blonde woman in tears alert: </strong>Sweden and end of television show montage's Carolina Kluft can only manage 6.42m in her third \"long\" jump and so is out of the competition.</p> <!-- Block 182 --> <p><strong>1.41pm: Athletics and Naylor: </strong>The <strong>women's 5,000m final</strong> is under-way in the Bird's Nest. And the women's <strong>hockey</strong> final between China and Holland is also off. \"I can't really Carolina Kl\u00fcft's reasoning in sitting out the heptathlon in favour of the long jump,\" writes Gary Naylor. \"She's gone from being the greatest female athlete in the world to an also-ran, when she could have had a well earned break.\" Be fair, Gary: she also failed in the triple jump.</p> <!-- Block 183 --> <p><strong>1.46pm: Football: </strong>Brazil are 2-0 up against Belgium in the bronze medal football match, which just sounds wrong anyway. It also keeps up Belgium's fine blank in the medal table at these Games.</p> <!-- Block 184 --> <p><strong>1.49pm: Football: </strong>Manchester City's Jo has just scored a third goal in the football, spanking home from the edge of the box, his second of the match, to wrap up the bronze. Certain career-threatening injury surely follows once he starts up front for City, so it must feel good to end his career on a high.</p> <!-- Block 185 --> <p><strong>1.52pm:</strong> Nil-nil in the hockey, Brazil have \"won\" the football (bronze medal) and Lilia Shobukhova leads with 1,000m left in the 5,000m race.</p> <!-- Block 186 --> <p><strong>1.55pm: </strong>The Turkish runner Alemitu Bekele takes to the lead with 800m left.</p> <!-- Block 187 --> <p><strong>1.58pm: Athletics:</strong> Great finish in the 5,000m as the Ethyopian Tirunesh Dibaba streaks clear of Elvan Abeylegesse in the final lap to add 5,000m gold to her 10,000m triumph. An epic double, to be sure.</p> <!-- Block 188 --> <p><strong>2pm: </strong>A shoddy time of 15 minutes 41 seconds for Dibaba in the 5,000m, which is way outside her personal best, I'm told. <strong>Jade Johnson</strong> oversteps on her final long jump, and came something like seventh overall.</p> <!-- Block 189 --> <p><strong>2.03pm:</strong> The women's long jump gets kind of tight at the end, as the Russian Tatyana Lebedeva, sporting a Kevin Pieterson-esque skunk-style hair flash (observation (c) Gary Naylor) leaps 7.03m with the last jump of the competition. It's <em>that</em> close (where <em>that</em> equals 1cm) shorter than the Brazilian Maurren Higa Maggi's leap from earlier, and the Brazilian clings on for gold.</p> <!-- Block 190 --> <p><strong>2.08pm: </strong>\"COVER THE HANDBALL!\" bellows Rachael Lorna Baruchello from the north of Iceland, so loud the windows shook in Farringdon. \"Going to be a national holiday here if Iceland make the final. They come out blazing, going 5-0 up in the first five minutes against Spain (that is a lot); Spain at one point caught up, but Iceland are 17-15 and about to start the second half.\" Do you really need me to cover it, Rachael? You seem to have it pretty well under control. And to understand what in His name is going on, which is more that I can boast.</p> <!-- Block 191 --> <p><strong>2.12pm: Athletics: </strong> It's the final of the women's 4x100m relay, in which Britain's women have already upstaged the men by being able to pass a piece of metal to each other three times in a generous-enough allocation of track. The Jamaicans are red hot favourites for gold here, with the world record under threat.</p> <!-- Block 192 --> <p><strong>2.14pm: </strong>Boxing: And Ireland's Kenny Egan is in the ring on the other channel. Hold on, this running shouldn't take long.</p> <!-- Block 193 --> <p><strong>2.16pm: Pantomine relaying: </strong> And the It's A Knockout relay runners are out again! Great Britain drop the baton, clang. Jamaica drop the baton, clang. Russia get the gold; Nigeria get the bronze but -- get this -- BELGIUM! get the silver.</p> <!-- Block 194 --> <p><strong>2.19pm: Athletics: </strong>OK, forgive me, Great Britain's sprint relay team. They didn't drop the baton. Instead, Montell Douglas couldn't find the hand of Emily Freeman, who had sprinted off way too early. \"I don't know what happened,\" said Freeman.</p> <!-- Block 195 --> <p><strong>2.22pm: Boxing: </strong> OK, the less said about the relay, the better, so it's over to the boxing ring, where Ireland's Kenny Egan is thumping Britain's Tony Jeffries bang upside the head and leading 8-1 at the end of the third round. It's a proper pummelling.</p> <!-- Block 196 --> <p><strong>2.25pm: Boxing: </strong><strong>Great Britain's Tony Jeffries WINS! a bronze medal in the heavyweight boxing</strong>. That's WINS! in the sense that he gets utterly thumped 10-3 by Kenny Egan, who goes through to the final to box for gold.</p> <!-- Block 197 --> <p><strong>2.35pm: Pedantry and inaccuracy:</strong> Thanks to all 11* of you who noticed that Montell Williams is actually an American chat-show host and that Montell Douglas was the British sprinter involved in the relay pantomime at the Olympics moments ago. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Connor has got her knickers in a twist about the jonny-come-latelys to the Olympics and has lost all track of her capitalisation: \"don't get me wrong I love the Olympics nothing quite beats watching obscure sports were you're not entirely sure what's going on at 3am. but it does mean that every numpty who usually loathes supports and thinks I'm a real saddo for always knowing the cricket score (the notable exception being our noble Chief Exec who relies on me for the score) is suddenly is an expert on sport and expressing inane and inaccurate opinions as if they're fact - no possibility that the 2012 games can be for sport enthusiasts only?\" Don't knock the expression of inane and inaccurate opinions as if they're fact, Elizabeth. Some of us depend on that to feed our families.</p> <p>*ten more than actually emailed.</p> <!-- Block 198 --> <p><strong>2.41pm:</strong> After seeing off Australia, the nation's fear-fed antipathy has shifted towards Russia, who have now sneaked up to within one gold of Great Britain in the medals table, thanks to their ability to hold onto baton better than any of us lot, and to swim, shoot, swordfight, ride a horse and run better than us. \"Phillips, Shanzne and now Tony. Don't they realise we NEED those golds. Russia is now only one behind us in the table,\" says James Andrews, representatively.</p> <!-- Block 199 --> <p><strong>2.44pm:</strong> Holland are 2-0 up in the final of the women's hockey with six minutes left. Lightning \"Usain\" Bolt is up in the Bird's Nest soon in the men's 100m relay final.</p> <!-- Block 200 --> <p><strong>2.52pm: </strong> Back to the Worker's Gymnasium for more pugilism. It's David Price, the 6ft 8in super heavyweight, fighting the hot favourite Roberto Cammarelle from Italy. And it's not great for Price in the first round. He lost it 5-0.</p> <!-- Block 201 --> <p><strong>2.57pm: Boxing: Team GB!GB!GB!'s David Price WINS! bronze in the men's super heavyweight division</strong> - and by WINS! I mean has seven-bells knocked out of him by the Italian Roberto Cammarelle in the semi-final, forcing the referee to stop the contest in the second round with the Italian 9-0 up and Price seeing constellations.</p> <!-- Block 202 --> <p><strong>3.05pm: </strong> In the diving, both the pipsqueak Tom Daley and the old-timer Pete Waterfield have qualified for the final of the men's 10m highboard. Daley was 11th, Waterfield is an outside medal chance, qualifying in fourth. Meanwhile Sean Ingle <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/22/irish_walker_costin_crosses_th.html\">not only reckons that walking is a sport, he's staked his blogger's reputation on it</a>.</p> <!-- Block 203 --> <p><strong>3.06pm: </strong>Bryan Clay of the United States coasts home in the final event of the decathlon. He could practically have run the 1500m backwards to win it, such was his lead. Full tallies are being calculated, but Clay was miles ahead. Meanwhile -- and get down to the staff canteen to watch it on telly if you want to Amir Jones -- the men's 4x100m relay teams are on the track.</p> <!-- Block 204 --> <p><strong>3.09pm: </strong>\"Why doesn't one team just plan to do standing start, safety-first baton changes?\" wonders Chris Mills, not unreasonably. \"They would probably get a silver every time. Relying on other's incompetence is a reliable tactic in anything involving human beings. Don't strive to excel, sit down and let success come.\"</p> <!-- Block 205 --> <p><strong>3.10pm: Athletics: Jamaica break the world record in the men's 4x100m relay</strong></p> <!-- Block 206 --> <p><strong>3.12pm: Three golds, three world records for Usain Bolt</strong></p> <!-- Block 207 --> <p><strong>3.15pm: </strong>Amazing stuff in the Bird's Nest, where Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, Usain Bolt and Asafa Powell have just shaved 0.3secs off the world record for the 4x100m relay. They win it by close to a full second, from Trinidad and Tobago and Japan. Bolt ran the third leg, incidentally, before handing off to Powell for the anchor. Get the party started.</p> <!-- Block 208 --> <p><strong>3.22pm:</strong> And with that, and because my computer is crashing every other minute, we're drawing this shambles to a close. Thanks for the emails, sorry for the typos, join us tomorrow for more of the same. Bye.</p>"
