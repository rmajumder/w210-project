  "<p>Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, known to prize his reputation for plain speaking, yesterday lambasted environmentalists as \"idle\", saying they \"prance around\" while doing nothing to protect nature.</p> <p>The diatribe was triggered by a spate of protests against government plans for more than 40 hydroelectric dams, the decision to build nuclear power stations, and fish farms which are said to be polluting beaches on Turkey's Aegean coast.</p> <p>On a visit to Rize, a city on the Black Sea, Erdogan made little attempt to win over hearts and minds, instead asking campaigners: \"Where were you until now? Why were you silent? The government is trying to do something now. Why didn't you do anything when the fish farms were first built? There is this tendency to hit at the government and Tayyip Erdogan no matter what. You don't have the right.\"</p> <p>The \"finest environmentalists\", he continued, were himself and his government - not the \"idle environmentalists\" of campaign groups who failed to recognise his achievement in committing Turkey to the Kyoto treaty. \"Just ask those who prance around saying 'I am an environmentalist': what have they done for the world or the environment?\" he said. \"They are just people who try to do something with their spare time. We have signed the Kyoto protocol. Did they even stop to say thank you?\"</p> <p>Erdogan's attack coincided with the arrest at the weekend of 33 campaigners - many foreign nationals - at a camp in the town of Sinop, where they were protesting against plans to build a nuclear plant.</p> <p>While the prime minister may have calculated that his approach would appeal to voters concerned about energy needs and economic development, it has provoked outrage within the green movement and warnings from political commentators.</p> <p>Umit Sahin, a spokesman for Turkey's Green party, said Erdogan favoured \"using force against the green opposition\".</p> <p>Taylan Bilgi\u00e7, writing in the English-language Turkish Daily News, said Erdogan misunderstood the protests, which were \"a mass peasant movement\".</p> <p>\"Erdogan is strongly advised to find ways to ease concerns, because what he faces is much more than a bunch of pony-tailed, placard-toting, latte-loving adolescents,\" wrote Bilgi\u00e7.</p>",
  "<p>Unlike the light entertainment industry, the fashion industry isn't known to have an appetite for nostalgia. But a quick flick through this month's glossy magazines suggests otherwise. For fronting the new campaigns of several major league fashion houses are a host of familiar faces. </p> <p>There's Linda Evangelista, with her trademark haughty sneer, wearing Prada's new austere lace look, Naomi Campbell shaking a waist-long mane of hair in an Yves Saint Laurent dress, and a black-bobbed Claudia Schiffer posing in front of a shabby-chic door for Chanel. It is unmistakable: the original first-name-only supermodels are back. So back in fact that Vanity Fair has dedicated eight pages of its new issue to Evangelista, Schiffer, Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Stephanie Seymour and Christy Turlington photographed in various states of undress by Mario Testino.</p> <p>For an industry hung up on youth, it would seem to be a surprising move. Evangelista is now 43, while Campbell and Schiffer are both 38 - geriatric in modelling terms. All replace models almost half their age from previous seasons. </p> <p>But the return of the supermodels has nothing to do with the fashion industry promoting the beauty of grown-up women above teenagers. Nor does it suggest the return of 90s fashion, or even the industry's frustration at the inability of an army of teenage Russian models to perfect anything other than the \"vacant\" look.</p> <p>This change in direction is in fact all about a far less glamorous factor: the shrinking global economy. Received fashion wisdom goes that a recognisable face is the most reassuring way to persuade consumers to part with their cash in lean times. This theory is backed up by figures too. Since Evangelista appeared in the L'Oreal adverts, the cosmetics giant has reported a 20% increase in sales over 18 months. No wonder Prada has followed suit.</p> <p>Simon Chambers, managing director of Storm model management, supports the supermodel-brings-revenue theory. \"By going straight to the stars of the supermodel era, clients are benefiting from immediate face recognition and are wisely targeting where consumer power is strongest,\" he says. </p> <p>In other words, Linda can persuade you to buy a \u00a31,000 tote - the subliminal advertising message being that she has lasted ages and so will this bag. Forget hemlines - Linda, Naomi and Claudia are the truest indicators of the state of the economy.</p>",
  "<p>US road deaths are at their lowest since the 1960s as the rocketing price of petrol puts a strain on America's love affair with the car.</p> <p>The number of fatalities is on track to fall by 10% this year to around 37,000, the lowest since 1961, according to research suggesting the reduction is due to people cutting out leisure travel to save money.</p> <p>When global oil prices soared during the spring, the number of fatalities slumped by 22% in March and by 18% in April, the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute found. \"It seems as if we have changed our driving behaviour rapidly and drastically,\" said Michael Sivak, a professor at the institute.</p> <p>As motorists look for savings, they first tend to reduce their mileage on recreational outings. \"There's been a lot of coverage on how to squeeze a few extra miles out of your tank - driving slowly is one way to do that,\" said Sivak.</p> <p>Those most affected are low-income groups including teenagers and older people, who have higher accident rates.</p>",
  "<p>As stages go, London's Covent Garden is a pretty good place to have a public power struggle and that seems to be what two giants of the global property market have decided to do.</p> <p><strong>Liberty International</strong>, owner of the capital's flower market-turned-shopping centre as well as a host of other sites including Lakeside in Thurrock, has found itself the target of the affections of Simon Property Group, America's largest public real estate company, and Australian rival Westfield Group, the world's largest listed property business.</p> <p>The heads of the two companies, David Simon in the US and Frank Lowy in Australia, are well known to the board of Liberty International. Both have been known to drop by corporate HQ when they are in the UK for a chat and Westfield has been suspected of quietly stake-building in Liberty for some time.</p> <p>Last week's announcement that SPG, which has an interest in 383 properties mostly in the US, had amassed a 3.45% stake seems to have flushed out the Australians. Westfield, which takes its name from the first shopping centre in New South Wales, which Czech immigrant Lowy opened with partner John Saunders in the late 1950s, said yesterday morning that it had snapped up 2.96% of Liberty International between June and July at an average price of 853p a share, \"for investment purposes\".</p> <p>Not having breached the 3% level, there was no reason for Westfield to come clean unless it wanted, traders suggested, to signal that it will not see Liberty taken out on the cheap.</p> <p>But just as the Australians revealed themselves, SPG came back with news that it has raised its stake to 4.22%. That has raised speculation of a bidding war for Liberty International but analysts at JP Morgan pointed out yesterday that the two firms have worked together on takeovers before - most notably in last year's $5.3bn deal for Rodamco North America. They also launched an unsuccessful hostile bid for the US-based Taubman Centers mall empire in 2003.</p> <p>Some credence was given to this view last night as rumours swept the City that Westfield will announce plans to raise more than $500m when it reports half-year results in Australia overnight. </p> <p>Liberty International refused to comment yesterday but sources close to the firm said they suspect this one will run and run. Shares in the company closed up 50.5p at 995.5p, the biggest riser in the FTSE 100.</p> <p>That was one of the few bright spots on a dark trading day. The early session was overshadowed by Wall Street's 241-point fall overnight. When New York traders returned to their desks, however, better than feared data on American consumer confidence helped the Dow regain some of its lost ground and that supported UK stocks to the close. The FTSE 100 ended the day down 34.9 points at 5470.7, having been down well over 100 points early in the day.</p> <p>The data on consumer confidence notwithstanding, most of the pressure on stocks yesterday was on the downside as sterling weakened against the dollar and the oil price ticked higher owing to the appearance of Hurricane Gustav, which might swing into the Gulf of Mexico and wreak havoc with production facilities over the next week. </p> <p>Ongoing fears about a drop in demand left mining and metals stocks lower, with <strong>Ferrexpo</strong> down 23.5p at 244.5p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> 29p lower at \u00a35.15 despite its strong half-year profits.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the FTSE 100, <strong>Bunzl</strong> eased 8.5p to 678p after announcing first-half profits in line with what the City expected and <strong>WPP </strong>gained 15p to 506.5p on last week's results and rumours that it is in talks with Microsoft about an asset swap. The deal would see Microsoft trade its Avenue A/Razorfish digital agency, possibly worth $800m, for the ad-serving platform that WPP got when it acquired 24/7 Real Media. </p> <p><strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong> was the biggest riser in the FTSE 250, up 6.5p at 52p on speculation sparked by a trade magazine that the bombed-out builder has done a deal to loosen the banking covenants which it is in danger of breaching by February. Talk was that the company, which saw a \u00a3500m rescue refinancing collapse in July, would announce the deal alongside its half-year results today, but a market source last night advised: \"Don't hold your breath.\"</p> <p>IT services company <strong>Axon Group</strong> saw its share price rise above the 600p level at which Indian rival Infosys pitched its recommended offer on bank holiday Monday as some in the City predicted a counter-offer, possibly from Fujitsu which is believed to have held talks with the company in the not too distant past. Axon closed up 103p at 606p.</p> <p><strong>Hardy Oil &amp; Gas</strong> dropped 45.5p to 418p after the company admitted it found nothing in one of its exploratory wells in India. </p> <p>Finally, talk that Apple is poised to unveil a new range of iPod Nano music players on September 9 helped <strong>Arm Holdings</strong> add 1.5p to 111.25p. The Cambridge-based company already has chips based on its designs in the iPod range as well as in the iPhone, and the new devices - aimed at the Christmas market - should boost its revenues. </p> <h2>Nap off</h2> <p>Anyone who has been to the theatre or cinema after a long day will know the sensation of having a <strong>micro-sleep</strong>.

  "<p>Sovereign wealth fund Temasek, which came to prominence last year after a controversial investment in Barclays, yesterday joined the chorus of concern that the global credit crisis has further to run.</p> <p>The fund, an investment arm of the Singapore government, warned of further contagion from the losses and write-downs suffered by western banks despite doubling profits to $18bn (\u00a39.7bn).</p> <p>In a confident statement of its intent to pick up bargains in the finance sector, the $185bn fund said it had benefited in recent years from expanding its investments in Asia and limiting its exposure to western countries.</p> <p>\"The fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months, with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations,\" chairman S. Dhanabalan said in the fund's annual report.</p> <p>However, it said it saw value in the European and US banking industries, despite the sub-prime disaster which has forced banks to write off more than \u00a3250bn.</p> <p>Last summer, ahead of the credit crunch, it poured more than \u00a32bn into Barclays for a 2.1% stake. Later it became one of the saviours of the US banking industry with a $5bn injection into Merrill Lynch for a 9% stake.</p> <p>Rumours have circulated that the fund will step in to rescue Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank.</p> <p>Yet while western banks have courted Temasek to shore up their ailing finances, many western governments have remained sceptical that their motives are purely financial.</p> <p>Government-owned investment vehicles such as Temasek and its bigger sister agency, the Government of Singapore Investment Corp (GIC), control over $2 trillion in assets - more than the combined value of the main German and Australian stock indices - and are expected to grow to $12 trillion by 2015.</p> <p>Temasek denies any political motives. \"The financial services industry is one we believe in,\" Manish Kejriwal, Temasek's senior managing director for investment, International and India, said at its annual briefing yesterday. </p> <p>Analysts said the strategy followed by the fund had realised huge profits at the expense of further exposure to the financial sector. </p> <p>Anshukant Taneja, who covers Temasek for ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's, said it had increased its exposure to unpredictable asset cycles and contagion.</p> <p>\"This may impact Temasek's ability to divest its stake in various entities and manage its portfolio,\" said Taneja. </p> <p>Another of the fund's high profile investments centres on Standard Chartered bank, which has largely avoided the worst of the write-downs. Temasek raised its holding in Standard Chartered over the past year to 19% from 13%.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Allowances for us, and them</strong></p> <p>Coal minister Malcolm Wicks seems to be the last person left in the government willing to sign replies to complaints about plans to build new coal-fired power stations without carbon capture and storage kit. The latest letter to find its way to Eco Soundings is shorter than usual, though. What's missing, we notice, is the usual patient explanation to objectors that all this extra carbon is a fair price to save British energy supplies, jobs and investment from fickle winds, young renewable alternatives and feisty Russian gas suppliers. Perhaps Wicks was a bit more cautious because he was replying on behalf of the foreign secretary, and former environment secretary, David Miliband. Miliband has not yet said publicly what he thinks of his job of persuading the world to cut greenhouse gas emissions while his colleagues at home plan to increase them. Perhaps Wicks' silence this time is the closest we'll get to an answer to that question.</p> <p><strong>Green grousing</strong></p> <p>Is there anything worse than the government telling us to be green? Yes. Companies, it seems. A survey from Legal &amp; General reinforces the cliche that the Brits are bloody minded libertarians at heart and want to make their own decisions and choices on how green to be. The most annoying business and government initiatives, it seems, are charging for waste and paying for carrier bags. But it's the grumpy over-55s who are most reluctant to change their eco-habits; 85% of them admitted to being annoyed by the green measures compared with 74% of 18- to 24-year-olds. </p> <p><strong>Europe's permit to pollute</strong></p> <p>The European electricity generating industry has, reckons the WWF, gained a stupefying \u00a356bn windfall from its free permits to pollute under the European emissions trading scheme. It still leaves the industry as the continent's single biggest contributor to climate change. To counter the criticism, its trade body, Eurelectric, is now planning to pledge that the entire European electricity system will be carbon neutral by 2050. This is welcome, but avoids the fact that in the meantime the industry is intending to keep building massive new coal-fired power stations, like E.ON's Kingsnorth in Kent, all over Europe. </p> <p><strong>Tough times for seagulls</strong></p> <p>The seagulls of Dumfries are getting a little cocky, and have been persecuting pets, spreading litter and forcing one poor paperboy to abandon his deliveries. The good word of the press must get through, of course, so hurrah to Michael Russell, Scotland's environment minister, who has pledged to get \"tough on seagulls and tough on the causes of seagulls\". Russell's new Seagull Taskforce will blitz nests and work out ways to stop the noisy scavengers settling down. \"By preventing gulls from nesting and destroying nests when discovered, we can actively discourage them from breeding in Dumfries and hopefully force them to look elsewhere,\" he said.

  "<p>\"The al-Qaida brand\"? \"The AQ-related narrative\" (Britain's secret propaganda war against al-Qaida, August 26)? What next? How about Team AQ - a sports initiative to channel those \"grievances\" into winning more medals at the next Olympics? It's a sad reflection of how far the official \"narrative\" has distanced itself from any understanding of what constitutes an ideology. Terrorism and al-Qaida do not - the former is a propaganda tactic of desperation and the latter a blanket term applied to users of this tactic against western interests.</p> <p>Any organisation serious about undermining the appeal of Islamism to people whose desperation is rooted in the hopelessness of grinding poverty and the suppression of all legitimate, nonviolent outlets for redress by dictatorial indigenous governments or foreign occupying powers should look to the lack of any viable, concrete, social or economic programmes put forward by any of the Islamist movements worldwide. </p> <p>But to highlight these issues as part of a hearts and minds psy-ops initiative begs the question of what answers the west has to offer. The recent proliferation of US-sponsored neoliberal makeovers masquerading as democracy and brutal, asset-stripping occupations masquerading as humanitarian interventions have only served to exacerbate the causes of the grinding poverty and hopelessness from which \"AQ\" recruits, so the spooks are unlikely to want to go there. </p> <p>I suppose there's nothing for it but to carry on broadcasting lies loud and often enough, through tame media outlets, until they become accepted as \"truths\" - WMD in Iraq, the responsibility of the Palestinians for the loss of their country, Russian responsibility for starting the spat with Georgia, to name only three precedents.<br><strong>N Graham</strong><br>Brighton, East Sussex </p> <p>So the al-Qaida narrative \"combines fact, fiction, emotion and religion and manipulates discontent about local and international issues. The narrative is simple, flexible and infinitely accommodating. It can be adapted to suit local conditions and may have a disproportionate influence on the understanding and interpretation of local or global events.\"</p> <p>This sounds like a fairly accurate description of the Bush-Blair propaganda campaign to justify the illegal invasion of Iraq which has led to the death of hundreds of thousands of innocent people and the emigration of millions more at a financial cost measurable in the trillions of dollars. This could certainly have gone a long way to eliminating world poverty.</p> <p>World opinion would be influenced more by actions than expensive spin. The government could start by withdrawing its unconditional support to the US and Israeli governments. Or better still, withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan and pursue a democratic and peaceful foreign policy.<br><strong>Mike O' Driscoll</strong><br>London</p>",
  "<p>It was somewhat surprising to turn to David Mitchell's column (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympics2008.olympicsequestrian\">Ballroom dancing for horses is so out of step</a>, Sport, August 16) and find our sport brought under the spotlight of an outsider, looking in via the Olympic shop window. As a lighthearted and highly subjective critique of dressage, we can take at face value Mitchell's reference to \"people dressed in a sort of funereal version of fox-hunting gear\" and brush off his statement that he is \"absolutely baffled\" by dressage and finds it \"unentertaining\". As it is a small minority sport, little exposed or explained via the media, it is not inconceivable that he remained unmoved by the strength, power, skill and beauty of the horsemanship we have seen at this year's Olympics. Observational comedy, but maybe not at its best.</p> <p>Here at British Dressage, the sport's governing body, we appreciate Mitchell's right to express differing points of view to our own, but we must react to some of the more serious allegations raised, particularly those concerning horses' welfare. Mitchell describes \"riding horses which seem to have been driven mad. The horses behave like the deranged dancing bears in those charity adverts, doing weird, fidgety, fastidious things that clearly aren't natural to them\". He also states: \"Quite what treatment these creatures have been put through to get them to be this odd I dread to think.\"</p> <p>We seek to reassure Mitchell and your readers that every detail of our sport is engineered to make the welfare of the horse paramount. Codes of conduct strictly adhered to from grassroots level to international competition ensure these ideals are upheld, and we work closely to the welfare guidelines of the International Equestrian Federation, the global governing body, to achieve this.</p> <p>The very goal of dressage is to attain lightness, harmony and freedom of movement, expressing the natural power, grace and beauty of these majestic animals. Far from being unnatural, each element performed in the Olympic arena can be witnessed in free horses moving at liberty, dressage being the art of capturing and training these actions with a rider, each exercise in turn developing the horse's suppleness and athleticism.</p> <p>You cannot force a horse to work at this level; the horses themselves are equine divas, born to perform on their sandy stage as much as the riders. They are willing partners in the dance. It would be impossible to succeed otherwise, as the slightest sign of tension or discord is marked down by the judges.</p> <p>We are pleased that, while Mitchell can't see the point of the sport, at least he accepts that \"there must be rules to dressage. It's not really just craziness arbitrarily scored, like a sort of tortured horse version of Mornington Crescent\".</p> <p>We accept that Mitchell is unlikely to be joining our organisation any time soon, but we hope his flippant allegations of torture and cruelty have not coloured the views of others. We are all entitled to our own opinions, but we hope Mitchell might, in future, recognise his own lack of knowledge of a subject before embarking on his own Olympic sport of mud-slinging.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Claire Booth is British Dressage's communications officer <a href=\"mailto:clairebooth@britishdressage.co.uk\">clairebooth@britishdressage.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Roy Keane has told his prospective signing Anton Ferdinand that the move to Sunderland will galvanise his career and he can become an England international.</p> <p>The 23-year-old West Ham centre-back is expected to complete the \u00a38m transfer today after yesterday's medical and Keane was happy to give an insight into how he persuaded his ninth signing of the summer to move to the Stadium of Light.</p> <p>\"Maybe Anton needed a new environment to get his career on to a new level,\" said Keane, who will take Sunderland to his former club Nottingham Forest in the Carling Cup tonight. \"He has had a very good club in West Ham, don't get me wrong, but sometimes when a player comes through the ranks and they have been there since they were a young kid, I think sometimes they get to a bit of a crossroads. They think, which road am I going to go on? Am I going to go to another level or just stay where I am?\"</p> <p>The sale of Ferdinand, who rejected a new contract this year, has irritated West Ham's manager, Alan Curbishley - reportedly the deal was agreed at boardroom level without his consent. It may also annoy Sunderland's local rivals, Newcastle United, who were also interested in Ferdinand but were told he was unwilling to move so far north. But Keane believes the deal for the former England Under-21 international is good for all concerned because Ferdinand wanted to avoid going stale and West Ham will receive a decent fee for him.</p> <p>\"There is no reason why he can't go on and become a top, top player. I think he has an international future,\" said Sunderland's manager. \"He has played over 150 games and we're on about players with a bit of experience so, for all his rawness, he has a few games under his belt. He knows the Premiership, he is English, it's a good price, so it suits everyone. It will be up to Anton if he goes up to the next level; he has the ability but, trust me, it is always up to the player how far they go.\"</p> <p>Keane is confident he will make one final signing before the close of the transfer window, with the Portsmouth left-back Hermann Hreidarsson the latest name to be linked with the Black Cats.</p> <p>The impending arrival of Ferdinand has not tempted Keane to allow any of his players to leave on the cheap and there was a rebuke yesterday for the former Sunderland manager Mick McCarthy, now at Wolverhampton Wanderers. They have made their peace since McCarthy, as Ireland's manager, sent Keane home from the 2002 World Cup after a row but Sunderland's manager was unimpressed by his former international team-mate's \u00a31.5m offer for the defender Danny Higginbotham.</p> <p>Keane paid more than double that 12 months ago to sign him from Stoke and said: \"We paid good money for Danny and he has done well for us. He played 20-odd games in the Premier League last season and scored three goals. If someone tells me his value has halved in that time, then he won't be going anywhere.\"</p>",
  "<p>The messages issued from on high by West Ham United claim unity and a shared sense of purpose yet, even with the Premier League table in embryonic form, the gloom is gathering in east London. Alan Curbishley suffered his first defeat of the campaign on Sunday and will lose another of his players, Anton Ferdinand, to Sunderland today. The manager had approached this season braced for a battering, though, even with that in mind, the bookies' favourite to face the sack first might concede that talk of crisis and calamity has come early.</p> <p>Curbishley could be forgiven his beleaguered look even as he contemplated this evening's visit of Macclesfield Town in the Carling Cup. The fixture should offer respite after the humbling at Manchester City, though relief may prove temporary. It will take more than victory over League Two opposition to convince the watching world that all is well behind the scenes as discontent swells. A tenth-place finish last term was insufficient to convince the doubters at the Boleyn Ground who watched their side stagnate in what, only recently, would have been deemed creditable mid-table while an array of talent loitered on the treatment table. The surrender at Eastlands and an apparent policy of squad trimming have done little to improve the mood.</p> <p>The manager was greeted yesterday with reflections upon Ferdinand's departure and suggestions that Craig Bellamy might follow. Those rumours prompted a swift response at boardroom level, the chief executive, Scott Duxbury, insisting the Wales striker remains \"a very important part of our plans\". \"The club is being run on sound football and business principles in order to develop a squad which can deliver success this season,\" he said. \"No player would be bought or sold unless that helped to achieve that aim. We are not interested in selling players who are committed to the club and essential to our first-team squad. If a player refuses to sign a new contract or is not crucial to the manager's plans then we will look at offers on a case-by-case basis. It is the only sensible way to build for the future.\"</p> <p>Ferdinand's reluctance to agree new terms made him a saleable asset yet, even last week, the manager had considered the defender key and said he, not the board, would make \"the final decision on who gets sold\". He has since been reminded that this club's philosophy is changing rapidly. West Ham are paying for the excesses of Eggert Magnusson's chairmanship, heady days of ambitious spending which, remarkably, once prompted the board to target Champions League qualification just weeks after the team had scraped top-flight survival on the season's final afternoon. Curbishley might legitimately be criticised for having bought injury-prone players, or even for quirks in his selection policy, but he appears also to be a high-profile victim of the credit crunch at a club driven by unrealistic expectations.</p> <p>It is, perhaps, no coincidence that Magnusson departed just as the global downturn began taking its toll on Landsbanki, the Icelandic bank who are West Ham's backers. The former chairman had sanctioned the purchases of the likes of Bellamy, Kieron Dyer, Lucas Neill, Matthew Upson and Scott Parker, all of whom are on salaries of more than \u00a33m a year. Fredrik Ljungberg earned \u00a385,000 a week and had his contract paid up last month, a move that effectively cost the club some \u00a36m.</p> <p>Their earnings bred resentment in the dressing room. Robert Green has stated he feels \"completely undervalued\" after being denied a pay rise. Dean Ashton was as unsettled until agreeing improved terms. Bobby Zamora, John Pantsil and Richard Wright have been sold, the former joining Fulham for \u00a34.8m bewildered that the club's stance had veered from the offer of new terms one minute to an acceptance of the Cottagers' bid the next. More players, he warned, would follow him.</p> <p>That proved prophetic. The club's hierarchy, led by the chairman, Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, still feels the squad is \"bloated\". Curbishley might disagree - \"I've made my feelings known about transfers and we need to back up the squad if we can,\" he said. There is scepticism about his ability in the stands and, in the circumstances, the manager might be justified in feeling he has been made a scapegoat for Magnusson's mistakes.</p> <p>The manager had emerged from a six-hour board meeting in May with his position apparently assured, though potential candidates for his job are circling. Harry Redknapp has distanced himself from a potential return to the club. The Croatia coach, Slaven Bilic, would be interested should the position become available while Pini Zahavi, who retains allies within the Upton Park hierarchy, is anxious to secure a return to English football for Avram Grant. Curbishley has grown used to life under pressure but, for the time being, there is no respite in sight.</p> <h2>Five big signings that have not worked out for Alan Curbishley</h2> <p><strong>Luis Boa Morte</strong></p> <p><strong>From Fulham, \u00a35m</strong></p> <p>Curbishley's first signing as West Ham manager and arguably his most costly mistake - the 30-year-old has scored one goal in 33 starts since his move</p> <p><strong>Lucas Neill</strong></p> <p><strong>From Blackburn, \u00a31.5m</strong></p> <p>Chose West Ham over Liverpool but it seems fair to assume it was the \u00a380,000-a-week salary on offer that made up his mind</p> <p><strong>Julian Faubert </strong></p> <p><strong>From Bordeaux, \u00a36m</strong></p> <p>Eyebrows were raised when Curbishley signed the unknown Frenchman.

  "<p>The man who looked after Louis XIV's money, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, spoke for finance ministers down the ages when he said the art of taxation involved plucking the goose in the way that got the most feathers for the least hissing. Raising revenue is rarely popular, and savvy chancellors go about it quietly in the hope of escaping attention. But Alistair Darling now finds himself in the unfamiliar position of being pressed to introduce a brand new tax, one aimed at energy firms. You might think he would find this refreshing; all the more so since he is starting to run up a serious overdraft: this month's figures showed his borrowing running at twice its rate of a year ago. The signs from Mr Darling are, however, that he will proceed with caution, if he proceeds at all.</p> <p>For the 70 Labour MPs making the argument - who include a handful of ministerial aides - this should be an open-and-shut case. Families struggling with a jump in average energy bills to \u00a31,300 a year bitterly resent it when the companies punishing them are publishing bumper profits. Clawed back through a windfall tax, this money could be used to insulate the homes of the vulnerable from economic chill winds. At the same time it would remind the electorate whose side Labour was on, breathing new life into a floundering government. Ranged against this compelling political case, however, are a number of technocratic concerns, some of them serious.</p> <p>As with any levy on corporations, purists may argue it would be better to tax income instead. After all, the only thing that pays a tax in the end is a person. Why not go after rich people directly instead of hitting those hapless middle-Englanders whose pension pots happen to be invested in a faceless energy company? An imaginary supertax, though, is hardly a reason to oppose redistribution from shareholders in energy firms to the poor - and especially not when the political prospects for a more direct charge on the rich seem remote. A slightly more plausible worry is that a retrospective levy on investments that have proved profitable may deter entrepreneurs from taking big risks in future - and might make them particularly nervous about pouring much-needed capital into the energy infrastructure. There were similar concerns with the one-off levy Labour imposed on the privatised utilities back in 1997. Yet for progressive voices, including this newspaper, these concerns were outweighed by the pressing need to raise extra revenue for pressing social needs.</p> <p>Back then the cause was tackling youth unemployment, and giving poor people warmth is, of course, every bit as important. There is, however, another difference. The privatised firms, which had mostly been sold off on terms that disadvantaged the taxpayer, were easy to identify. Establishing exactly which energy profits are excessive - and then taxing them - is much harder. The biggest winners from booming world energy prices are the global oil producers. Much as it might like to, the government cannot tax Saudi Arabia. There is still the North Sea, but when ministers last upped the tax there they promised not to hit it again during this parliament. The focus is thus on energy wholesalers instead. They always seem quicker to pass rises than falls on world markets on to the customer, though the charge is a hard one to nail. Most of the big firms have tentacles reaching into other sectors - and often abroad - so pinpointing where the money is made in the accounts is formidably difficult.</p> <p>The task, however, is worth attempting. The community is entitled to try and claim a bigger share of rising energy profits, whether through a direct tax or by strengthening plans to charge generators for the right to pollute. The government has lost credibility on inheritance, capital gains and 10p taxation. Designing a smart package on energy will not reverse all the damage. But it could be a valuable start.</p>",
  "<p>Mick Easterby is a 77-year-old in a hurry. \"Get in,\" he says, as his 4x4 comes to an abrupt stop, and then sets off again with his passenger barely halfway inside. \"I'm going to show you something special.\"</p> <p>Barely a minute later, we are driving towards the top of Easterby's gallop and the views across north Yorkshire are extraordinary. There are green fields and gentle hills in every direction, while to the south, nearly 13 miles away, York Minster stands clear and bright on the skyline. </p> <p>\"Isn't this just the most wonderful place?\" Easterby says. \"I appreciate it every single time I come up here. There's the Minster, then you turn to the right, and there's the [ruins of Sheriff Hutton] castle. I'm going to get buried up there, at the top of the gallops.\"</p> <p>It is a side of \"Spitting Mick\" Easterby that the punters never see. Not much given to interviews during his 52 years with a licence, his public profile, such as it is, is something of a caricature, the blunt Yorkshireman who minds his own business and would ask you to do the same. And it's true that as he gazes out over his 2,000 acres of farmland and gallops, you can almost imagine him emerging fully formed - stout, ruddy and bluff - from this soil to which he will one day return. </p> <p>But he has an impish humour too, as if the landscape he loves makes him feel 10 years old again, and there are almost as many stories as horses. \"I've told my son he can take over whenever he wants,\" he says, \"but he's trying to wear me out first. He thinks I don't know.\"</p> <p>Easterby has long since lost count of the winners he has trained, not to mention the others who passed through his hands as buyer or seller, but his proudest moment - so far - was in 1977, when he saddled Mrs McArdy to win the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket. Better still, given his lifelong passion for shrewd bloodstock deals, a thousand guineas was her price-tag too. </p> <p>\"I saw her in a field and I just stopped dead,\" he says. \"I thought, I've got to buy this one. She was owned by Lord Grimthorpe and I bought six from him, all mares and fillies, for six thousand, but she was the one I really wanted. When I got home, I rang my brother and told him I'd just bought a Classic horse.</p> <p>\"The most wonderful thing about it was that Lord Grimthorpe was not one bit upset, and when she won the Guineas he was the first one there to shake my hand. Me, I might have been sulking, but he was a gentleman. That takes some character.\"</p> <p>Other names that stand out in Easterby's extensive record include Lochnager, the July Cup winner in 1976. More recently, he took great pleasure from his achievements with Gentlemen's Deal, a Group winner while also starting out as a stallion.</p> <p>The loss of last week's Ebor meeting at his local track was keenly felt. \"The only thing in its favour is that it's saved me from a few thick heads,\" he says. \"I love that meeting, and after racing we'll always go on to the Mount Royale Hotel in town for sing-song. I love a good sing-song.</p> <p>\"The Gimcrack is one race that I'd really like to win again. And I'd also like to win one of the really big races at Cheltenham, as those have always evaded me. The trouble is, when I look like getting there, I sell them. I can't resist profit, the temptation is always too great.\"</p> <p>Easterby's is not a hi-tech operation. There is no vet in permanent residence, no weighing machine or pool, just some horse-walkers and an uphill gallop. </p> <p>\"I don't need to weigh a horse, I can tell you what it's lost as soon as I see it, and whether it's had a hard race or not. Blood tests, I done them by the thousand, but what finished me with them was when one of my owners was coming to York to see his filly run, and she had the worst blood you've ever seen. I said, I'm sorry, but she shouldn't run. He said run her, and she ran and she won.</p> <p>\"But I do train up a hill. I was doing interval training back in 1955 and I've always said you can train any horse for any trip with a six-furlong gallop.\" </p> <p>As for retirement, he hopes it will not be any time soon. \"When I die, that's when I'll retire,\" he says. \"This has never felt like work to me anyway, it's like a hobby and I've loved every single minute of it. I'm the luckiest man standing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Overweight people will today be told there are \"no excuses\" for being obese as the Conservative party launches a new \"responsibility\" deal on public health.</p> <p>The shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, will use a speech to the thinktank Reform, entitled No Excuses, No Nannying, to set out proposals on how the government and business can work together to address problems caused by poor diet, alcohol abuse and lack of exercise.</p> <p>\"Tell people that biology and the environment cause obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid: an excuse,\" he will say. </p> <p>\"As it is, people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight. Young people who think many of their friends binge-drink are likely to do so themselves. Girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves. </p> <p>\"Peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses.\"</p> <p>Vowing to \"take away the excuses\", Lansley will unveil proposals for the party's second \"responsibility\" deal with business.</p> <p>He will ask a new working group to consider: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> supporting EU-wide proposals for mandatory front-of-pack food labelling </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> asking the food industry to reduce portion sizes </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> a clampdown on food advertising </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> using role models and positive peer pressure to promote healthy living </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> local campaigns to promote sport, exercise and healthy lifestyles. </p> <p>He will float the idea of incentives for small businesses to improve the health of employees. \"We will take action to ensure people have the opportunities, information and incentives towards healthy living,\" Lansley will say.</p> <p>The speech comes after the Tory leader, David Cameron, said last month that the poor, obese and lazy spent too much time blaming social problems for their own shortcomings.</p> <p>Insisting a Conservative government would not be a \"nannying\" state, Lansley will deny that the proposals are \"about telling people what to do\".</p> <p>\"Tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people, because they have no excuse not to exercise, or eat their fruit and vegetables. Nannying - at least among adults - is likely to be counterproductive. Providing information is empowering, lecturing people is not. So, no excuses, no nannying.\"</p> <p>For teenagers, the party plans to deploy role models and social marketing techniques, not just to warn about the harm of \"risky behaviour\", but to offer \"positive empowerment they can achieve by choosing healthy living\".</p> <p>\"We must not constantly talk about tackling obesity and warning people about the negative consequences of obesity. Instead we must be positive - positive about the fun and benefits to be had from healthy living, trying to get rid of people's excuses for being obese by tackling the issue in a positive way.\"</p> <p>The responsibility deal on public health follows a similar initiative on producer waste announced earlier this year. The scheme is designed to encourage businesses to act in a socially responsible way and tackle issues that cannot be solved by regulation and legislation alone.</p> <p>However, business leaders criticised the scheme, saying it would cause confusion. The CBI's director general, Richard Lambert, said at the time: \"The proper role of government is to create certainty in the market and maintain a clear distinction between compulsory regulation and voluntary action. Where necessary, the government should regulate clearly and enforce the regulations strongly.</p> <p>\"There is a risk that responsibility deals would confuse this issue, by being almost a form of regulation by proxy, and would lack credibility.\"</p> <h2>A growing problem</h2> <p>Weight problems are estimated to cost the NHS and the wider economy as much as \u00a316bn a year, a figure that is expected to rise to \u00a350bn by the middle of the century. Nearly a quarter of men and women in England are obese, according to the Department of Health. Up to 18% cent of two- to 15-year-olds are described as obese and a further 14% as overweight. A government report last year suggested that if current eating habits and exercise trends persist, nearly 60% of men and 50% of women will be obese by 2050. A further 35% of adults will fall into the overweight category. The severely obese are likely to die on average 11 years earlier than someone with a healthy weight. <br><strong>Owen Bowcott</strong></p>",
  "<p>Richard Simpson's daily challenge is to persuade foremen on building sites to separate waste. The former architect is co-founder of the Brighton &amp; Hove Wood Recycling Project, which has recycled nearly 6,000 tonnes of timber since it opened in 1998. All would otherwise have been buried or chipped.</p> <p>The initiative was one of the first in Britain to take waste wood from building sites to be reused. From humble beginnings when he and a colleague lugged wood across town in a clapped-out camper van, the project has since become a model for community recycling. </p> <p>\"To building firms we were just a bunch of hippies,\" says Simpson. \"But we were the first in the country to go to commercial building sites. The trick is to win over the foreman.\" And to have a steady stream of volunteers and staff, who between them have collected lab tables from Roedean school, stage sets, and timber from Brighton pier and English Heritage sites. </p> <p>Grassroots projects such as this are playing an underrated but important role in diverting materials produced by construction from landfill. Simpson provides timber to customers as diverse as the Chelsea Flower Show, students and home improvers. </p> <p>The project has become a model for community recycling nationwide. Simpson's co-founder, Richard Mehmed, has gone on to help establish 21 wood recycling projects in Cambridge, east London, Glasgow, Llandudno and Manchester, among others, using Brighton as a template. </p> <p>These kinds of projects are making an impact but the task is herculean. Last week, the House of Lords science committee reported that householders account for 9% of the UK's waste annually. The construction industry, by contrast, generates 90m tonnes of waste a year, producing about 32% of the UK's total waste. Up to a third of construction materials end up in landfill and nearly 13% of materials delivered to building sites never get used. </p> <p>The Lords called for councils to prioritise reducing waste from businesses, and argued that companies should be made responsible for the waste associated with their products. \"We would like to see the VAT regime reformed so that products that have a long life-cycle, or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced, are made economically more attractive,\" said Lord O'Neill, who chaired the waste reduction sub-committee.</p> <p>The threat of rising landfill tax, set to reach \u00a348 per tonne by 2011, will certainly force construction companies to take waste seriously. \"It can be difficult to persuade people of the moral argument behind recycling [but] when a business realises that it will affect them financially, they are likely to respond,\" says Zoe Le Grand, project manager at industry body Constructing Excellence. \"Legislation is getting tighter. If they want to prepare their business for the future, they should get arrangements in place for recycling as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>Some contractors have started to act. Taylor Woodrow ran a pilot plasterboard recycling scheme in 2005 resulting in recycling rates of 72% from its housebuilding programmes. And like many construction companies, Persimmon Homes' Anglia branch segregates waste materials into separate skips on site, with 300 tonnes of recyclate distributed monthly to metal, plastics and woodchip companies.</p> <p>Skanska, one of the contractors for the \u00a31bn Bart's and the Royal London hospitals' redevelopment, has during the project reached recycling rates of 99.6% - 50,000 tonnes. \"A waste volume is agreed before we sign the contract,\" explains James MacMillan, the programme's environment manager. \"If the trade contractor goes over that, they pay for the waste. The key is to prevent waste from coming to site in the first place, [by] reducing packaging and working with trade contractors. Segregation and waste management should be the last link in the chain.\"</p> <p>Reuse of recyclate brought in from elsewhere is becoming more common. BAA's Terminal 5 construction at Heathrow reused more than 80,000 tonnes of materials. Crushed glass from local recycling banks was used to make site roads and around 30% of the concrete mix used for buildings, taxiways and aircraft stands was from a power generation byproduct, pulverised fuel ash. </p> <p>For smaller building firms that do not have the resources to employ an environment manager, help is at hand. Guidance has emerged from the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) and the Environment Agency's NetRegs website. </p> <p>The government, it seems, has woken up to the construction waste problem. Last April, the Environment Agency mandated site waste management plans for construction projects in England worth more than \u00a3300,000, in which, from the pre-construction stage onwards, firms must declare waste materials and how they will be disposed of. The agency says this will cut 100m tonnes of waste annually. </p> <p>Last June, the Strategic Forum for Construction, an industry-cum-government body, launched the strategy for sustainable construction, declaring aims for 50% reduction of construction, demolition and excavation waste to landfill by 2012 compared with this year. In May, the Construction Resources and Waste Roadmap was published by a public-private consortium, proposing 10 actions. The report was funded by a body of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p> <p>But the outlook for agencies created by the government to encourage sustainable practice among business is beginning to look gloomy. In the next tax year, the government plans to cut funding for environmental advisory agency Envirowise by more than 50%, and the Market Transformation Programme, National Industrial Symbiosis Programme and Wrap will all see their budgets slashed, something the waste reduction sub-committee expressed \"extreme disappointment\" over.</p>",

  "<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday hailed the recent Lambeth conference as a success while at the same time acknowledging the difficulties that lie ahead for the Anglican Communion.</p> <p>In a 1,500-word pastoral letter, sent by post over the bank holiday weekend to the 650 bishops who were in Canterbury last month for the once-a-decade meeting, the Right Rev Rowan Williams set out his personal reflections on the 17-day summit.</p> <p>He wrote that Lambeth had succeeded \"to a remarkable degree, more than most people expected\" in allowing all of the bishops to be heard. There was no doubt that nearly all those attending wanted the Communion to stay together. </p> <p>The conference, Lambeth 2008, was designed to maintain unity in the face of global rifts over the ordination of gay bishops, blessings of same-sex unions and cross-border interventions.</p> <p>About 230 bishops, mostly from Uganda, Nigeria and Kenya, boycotted the event. Many of these absentees were at the launch of a breakaway movement, the Global Anglican Future Conference, which is aimed at traditionalists.</p> <p>Williams also had to deal with discontent at home over the decision to ordain women as bishops with no special measures for objectors, and he arrived in Canterbury bruised by a divisive meeting of the general synod.</p> <p>Williams uses the letter to illustrate the Communion's common goals.

  "<p>It was David Lodge's novel Nice Work up for discussion on <strong>World Book Club</strong> (World Service). And nice was exactly how Lodge came across, with his positive, upbeat comments on the various questions posed. \"Charming voice and an interesting question,\" he said about a caller from Prague. </p> <p>There was much warmth from the audience, too, and if the programme has a flaw, it's that it could just as easily be called World Fan Club. \"I really respect this answer,\" said one thrilled caller. Book clubs in the real world can be places of terse debate and fallings-out over minute plot details, whereas this is a polite gathering of like minds in front of a revered author. </p> <p>But its plus point is this seeming intimacy, despite the global audience, with the studio audience small enough that you can hear the curve of individual laughs. This can lead to small admissions from the writers. Lodge explained that when he brought the protagonist of Nice Work back for a brief appearance in a later novel, he had forgotten how the earlier work ended and so left a key plot detail unresolved. \"Now I've given it away,\" he said of this omission. \"To the world.\" </p>",
  "<p>You thought the Russian oil industry was a place no sane western investor should go? Imperial Energy is on the brink of proving there are exceptions to this rule. Yesterday's conditional \u00a31.4bn cash offer from India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) could secure Imperial's status as a legendary investment. The firm's original investors got in at 25p in 2004. Those who are still on board, like chairman Peter Levine, who stands to collect about \u00a3100m, will be cashing out at \u00a312.50.</p> <p>Even with the terms on the table, Imperial's shareholders can't quite believe their good fortune. The shares closed yesterday at \u00a312.15 - slightly below the offer price - reflecting the fear that the Russian authorities could yet block the deal. That must be a risk but it's also true that a state-owned Indian company would probably not have reached this point without encouragement from Moscow. Indeed, the suggestion yesterday was that ONGC has agreed to bring in Russian group Rosneft as a partner.</p> <p>So how is Levine, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer from Leeds, so close to hitting a jackpot that has evaded so many? In the past, he has preached the importance of being sensitive to Russian concerns. In practice, that seems to mean employing local workers and investing in infrastructure. It also clearly helped that the Levine family was originally from Tomsk, the region of Siberia where Imperial bought its drilling licences when prices were low.</p> <p>Do these factors explain why Imperial overcame obstacles that might have brought down others? Who knows. At one point, Gazprom seemed to want a 25% stake at less than fair value. At other times, Imperial appeared to be on a collision course with Russia's formidable ministry of natural resources. Both issues gradually disappeared.</p> <p>Despite those scares, Levine said yesterday that he would be confident in taking Imperial to its next stage of development - from exploration to production - as an independent. We must believe he is sincere, but his best decision was surely to sell up. He may have judged two cycles - the oil price and Russia's tolerance of western companies in its oil industry - to perfection.</p> <p><strong>Rio quite bravo</strong></p> <p>Rio Tinto's interim figures yesterday were predictably excellent - you can't quibble with a 55% increase in underlying earnings, even when the comparison is flattered by the inclusion of the Alcan acquisition. The group also threw a few eye-catching statistics at those who doubt the \"stronger for longer\" thesis on metal prices - try up to 50,000 skyscrapers to be built in China between now and 2025.</p> <p>So why, despite these bullish boasts, did Rio's performance - possibly its last set of figures before the gloves come off in the scrap with BHP Billiton - feel a little flat?</p> <p>It was because Rio has provided little hard evidence yet that its growth prospects are markedly superior to BHP's. Rio reported underlying earnings of $5.47bn yesterday, but BHP produced $9.4bn last week. So Rio's share of the combined total was 37%, meaning this particular dial has barely budged during nine months of argument and counter-argument.</p> <p>BHP's offer - 3.4 of its shares for every Rio share - would give the target's shareholders 44% of the combined business. That would look mean if Rio was rapidly closing in on 40% of the combined profits, but it's not - or, at least, not imminently. Rio, with a heavier weighting towards iron ore, where prices are high and are locked in annually, may reach 38% by the time the full-year numbers are counted, but even that wouldn't radically alter the perception that these two huge corporations are running at roughly the same pace.</p> <p>The war is still phoney since the EU competition regulators won't speak until December. BHP, though, will be relaxed. It took a risk in allowing its bid to sit on the table for a year. The danger was that the terms would end up looking stale. Instead, the current verdict must be much the same as it was in January: 3.4 for 1 is probably not a knockout but it will be hard for Rio to resist, say, 3.7 for 1. </p> <p><strong>Houses of pain</strong></p> <p>The housebuilders can't seem to agree. Last week, Persimmon's chief executive, Mike Farley, said the market was \"not getting any worse\". Yesterday the smaller Bovis Homes said \"the current difficult trading environment will continue for the foreseeable future\".</p> <p>Maybe the difference is merely a matter of tone. Maybe it reflects the two companies' regional differences. But last month's 65% fall in mortgage approvals gives the best guide to the big picture - it still looks awful.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling are facing increasing calls for a windfall tax on energy companies - which they should ignore. A windfall tax is arbitrary, unexpected and unfair. It would penalise companies already paying large amounts of tax and planning to invest billions in Britain's infrastructure in the next 10 years. It would sour Britain's investment climate in a global race for energy and resources. While it could close a short-term funding gap and help provide assistance for fuel-poor households, its long-term impact would be counter-productive. There are better ways of raising the money.</p> <p>Proponents of a one-off measure usually cite Labour's imposition of a windfall tax on the utilities in 1997, which raised \u00a34.5bn to fund the New Deal for the unemployed. Industry squealed at the time, but paid up. The measure was in the Labour manifesto for more than a year, giving companies time to plan. Industry had also made huge gains in profitability since privatisation and was in a stronger position than it is now. </p> <p>A decade ago, Britain was a net exporter of oil and gas as North Sea output boomed. That position has reversed, and this year we look set to import 40% of our gas needs. The UK has invested less in storage capacity for gas than other countries - we have room for 10 days' peak supply compared with 60 in France and 80 in Germany, so are much more dependent on the wholesale market in winter. That market and many gas supply contracts are tied to the global oil price, which has doubled this year.</p> <p>This is why energy companies have recently raised their prices by such large amounts - 35% alone for British Gas's gas customers and 9% for electricity. The operators are trying to protect their profits as they face rising supply bills.</p> <p>While headline figures of nearly \u00a31bn in profits for Centrica, the owner of British Gas, in the first half of the year make it look as if operators are coining it from high consumer prices, the underlying picture is complex. British Gas's profit from its residential business was down 70%. The company makes a margin of 4% on household sales, which at \u00a3166m are still a sizable chunk - but not as lucrative as at first glance.</p> <p>It should be stressed that these are profit-making enterprises - they are no longer state-owned. What's more, many are based overseas and have few allegiances to Britain. If they decide not to invest here, they can go elsewhere.</p> <p>The government is in a difficult position if it wants to intervene after the way the industry was privatised in the 1980s. Competition is supposed to dictate an efficient market. This may not be a perfect situation, especially when many gas and power companies overseas remain in government hands, but it is reality and very difficult to change. </p> <p>A further drawback to a windfall tax is what to include. Where energy companies have been making a lot of money this year is in their so-called upstream operations - in the production of oil and gas which benefits from those higher global prices. North Sea operators are largely international oil companies such as Shell, BP and Exxon. Shell, for example, made a profit equivalent to almost \u00a32m an hour in the first half of the year. But these companies already pay petroleum revenue tax on those North Sea profits at a rate of 50% and need to invest more to squeeze every last drop of oil from depleting fields. Their profits come from operations all over the world, and it would be hard to draw a line round money made only in the UK.</p> <p>Like it or not, we are all dependent on billions of pounds of investment from the energy sector over the next decade. The government has put the bill on renewables investment at \u00a3100bn over 10 years, and a new generation of nuclear reactors will not come cheap. Older generators have to be closed in the next seven years because of EU environmental legislation and the first nuclear station is unlikely to come on stream before 2018. There is a looming gap in our electricity output which will have to be filled by gas- or coal-fired stations - as yet unbuilt. Renewables will pick up some of the slack, but they are expensive to build, and many are stuck in the planning process.</p> <p>Already companies are grumbling about the difficulties of building power stations in Britain where they face long planning wrangles, little state help and environmental protests. Add an arbitrary levy to those drawbacks, and the UK becomes even less attractive for international investment dollars.</p> <p>One area where the government could legitimately raise funds from the energy industry has already been suggested by the regulator, Ofgem. Power generators have this year been given a one-off gain by receiving free pollution permits for the EU's carbon-trading scheme. The government is committed to auctioning just 7% of those permits this year, but the scheme allows for 10% to be sold. An auction of the additional 3% could raise \u00a3200m.</p> <p>I don't want to sound like an apologist for an unpopular industry - and it is undeniable that less well-off households face hardship this winter. But in my view, there are better ways than a windfall tax of levying the funds - potentially from a higher top rate of tax on individuals that would also go some way towards bridging a rising inequality gap.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:deborah.hargreaves@theguardian.com\">deborah.hargreaves@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<h2>Our friends in the north</h2> <p>Peter Hetherington may be mystified by the Tories' northern policies (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/20/housing.regeneration\">So what are the Tories' northern policies?</a>), but the government seems to be aiming to prove the thinktank correct. </p> <p>As Ian Jack recently reminded us, government policy towards northern Britain comprises a multibillion-pound dole of pointless giant aircraft carriers designed to create simple metal bashing jobs in traditional Labour areas. </p> <p>The billions to be wasted would have been more than enough to create the high-speed rail links that would connect the north to the 21st-century economy and reduce overheating in the south-east, and the railway construction phase would create genuine modern technical employment, but rather than build the infrastructure needed for the future, the government has chosen to try and revive moribund 19th-century industries.<br><strong>John Hall,</strong> Bristol </p> <p>Peter Hetherington, by the use of an exclamation mark, implicitly criticises development of the Thames Gateway because \"it lies on a flood plain\".</p> <p>Well, much of central London and the City of London lies on a flood plain. Surely Peter isn't suggesting that we abandoned these areas and their assets. Of course he isn't (I hope).</p> <p>London is currently protected by an extensive flood protection scheme, which includes the Thames Barrier and its associated embankments downstream. This system will require updating and improvement to continue to protect London, and the Environment Agency is currently working on these improvements. </p> <p>In order to continue to protect London these improved defences will have to extend into the Thames Gateway Area (as they do now): it therefore does actually make sense to develop in the Thames Gateway where there are existing defences and where new flood defences will have to be put in place in any event if London is to be protected.</p> <p>Peter also paints a picture of the south-east which, as a resident of the Thames Gateway area, I do not recognise: road congestion here is not \"intolerable\". The roads may be busy, but on the whole it is easy and quick to get around in this part of the world. Roads and other communications will need to be improved in order to cope with the new developments, but let us not pretend that this part of the south-east is incapable of further growth.<br><strong>S Boxall,</strong> Bexleyheath, London</p> <p>Peter Hetherington's view on a Tory thinktank's report that the north should be abolished and move south doesn't address the lacunae in Tory thought that the report suggests. </p> <p>London has been the \"great wen\" sucking in people from far and wide since at least the dawn of industrial capitalism, and if my experience of north London is anything to go by, it is continuing. It is something to be celebrated by the left - since most of the union and socialist organisers in the capital seem to come from the north (I'm north London Scottish myself) - and by the right since it proves that the market works. </p> <p>It might of course not be a bad idea if everything in the country was not quite so centralised in London and that, it might be thought, would be a more useful subject for a Tory think-tank to bang on about.<br><strong>Keith Flett,</strong> London</p> <h2>Housing happy families</h2> <p>Every government would like to promote family values, whether they're willing to shout about it or not.

Where do divorced dads \"keep\" their children? Certainly not, as Rentergirl makes pointedly clear, in their bachelor flat shares. </p> <p>Is there any policy to cover this? Are singletons required to be childless to be housed by private landlords? No doubt it will be left to housing associations to formulate a means of housing single baby families, as usual - Conservative policy suggests so, what with the so-called easing of restrictions on the voluntary sector that Mr Cameron has promised. </p> <p>When there was more state social housing, there was less crime, a less selfish society and certainly less homelessness.

  "<p><em>Lucas O'Connor is in Denver for the California politics blog <a href=\"http://www.calitics.com/\">Calitics</a></em></p> <p>I mentioned yesterday that this - like any political convention - is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/25/democrats2008.uselections2008\">heavy on the self-congratulation</a>. That's what conventions are for, so it's not a failing, it's just a way of being. So one of the few measures from inside the insanity is how the non-true believers react. And so far - it's really encouraging.</p> <p>A lot of ink was spilled about former <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/08/24/surprise_gop_speaker_at_dem_co.html\">GOP congressman Jim Leach</a> speaking at the convention. But it goes well beyond that to exhibit the good side of a truly big tent (as I write from the <a href=\"http://www.bigtentdenver.org/\">Big Tent</a> blogger headquarters). The Republican mayor of Fairbanks will be speaking too, which is great for folks like <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121962772641567941.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">Mark Begich and Ethan Berkowitz</a> running as Democrats statewide in Alaska - but it runs well beyond that.</p> <p>I was at Red Rocks last night for a show that included the country band <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sugarland\">Sugarland</a>. I've never heard of them because I'm an elitist liberal ivory tower egghead, but they rocked the crowd and went over very well. But in contrast to all the other musical acts I've seen so far, there was no overt political rhetoric between songs and definitely no mention or remote endorsement of the Democratic party. But they were there, and there enthusiastically, in support of green jobs and the fight against global warming. Because going green and being responsible simply is not a partisan issue anymore. It's a moral issue that transcends partisanism and simply divides responsible and irresponsible.</p> <p>Beyond all that though is the reaction on the street level. I've been to mini-rallies, fundraisers, receptions, parties, whatever at local restaurants and bars in downtown Denver. On a regular basis, the waitresses and bartenders are applauding strongly progressive speeches from bloggers and candidates. Denver is a strongly Democratic city. And that's fantastic. But it certainly doesn't preempt the many McCain yard signs I've seen outside of the general downtown area. There's simply no guarantee or expectation that the staff at a given venue will be inherently sympathetic.</p> <p>But our message is getting applause from the bartenders. Whether it's universal health care, green collar jobs, or the Responsible Plan, it says something when the bartenders clap. I've been in and around the back of bars for a few years in my life, and bartenders are not the most easily swayed of political targets. Our message isn't simply the Democratic message. What we're seeing this week is that the Democratic message and the Obama message is the \"American Dream\" in action.</p> <p>Partisanship can and will fall by the wayside when the message gets out.</p>",
  "<p>Highways in the US are at their safest since the 1960s as the rocketing price of petrol puts a strain on America's love affair with fast cars.</p> <p>The number of fatalities on US roads is on track to fall by 10% this year to around 37,000 - the lowest since 1961, according to research suggesting that deaths are plummeting as people cut out leisure travel, especially in the evenings, to save money.</p> <p>When global oil prices accelerated during the spring, the number of fatalities slumped by 22% in March and by 18% in April, the University of Michigan's transportation research institute found.</p> <p>\"It seems as if we have changed our driving behaviour rapidly and drastically in the last few months,\" said Michael Sivak, a research professor at the institute.</p> <p>As cash-strapped motorists look for savings, they first tend to reduce their mileage on recreational outings. These are often in the dark and are more likely to be on high-speed rural roads than on relatively safe urban commuter routes.</p> <p>Many motorists are driving more slowly in the belief that this will save them money. Sivak said: \"There's been a lot of coverage on how to squeeze a few extra miles out of your tank - driving slowly is one way to do that.\"</p> <p>Those most affected by austere economic times are low-income groups including teenagers and the elderly who have a higher accident rate than middle-aged motorists.</p> <p>Road safety has been a serious concern in the US over recent years. An OECD study last year put America in 42nd place out of 48 countries in deaths per capita, lagging behind Britain and other European nations. In an outgoing speech, the former US transportation secretary Norman Mineta described road fatalities as a \"public health crisis of epidemic proportions\".</p> <p>Lon Anderson, a spokesman for the AAA motoring organisation, said high fuel prices had caused US drivers to travel 58 billion fewer miles in the first seven months of this year.</p> <p>\"The unfortunate thing is that the high price of fuel and the recession are accomplishing things that the traffic safety community couldn't accomplish,\" he said. \"That is a silver lining to something that's very bad news to American families and to the economy.\"</p>",

  "<p>Let me try to place <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/michelleobama.democrats2008\">Michelle Obama's speech</a> within the context of how quickly the Obamas have moved up politically from a highly successful black couple to post-racial symbols on the brink of the presidency. I think it helps to explain a few things that have been troubling voters who've been sitting on the fence, and, frankly, that have been troubling me as well.</p> <p>At National Review Online, <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MWI2MDM1OGUxZDZjYWQyODhmYTIzZTE2NGRkYWQ3MzM=\">Byron York observes</a> that Mrs Obama's sunny, family-centric speech was entirely different in tone and substance from one she gave in North Carolina just a couple of months ago. \"In Charlotte,\" York writes, \"her America was a dark and ugly place, where people who work hard are knocked down by sinister forces - a place where even young children burst into tears when they realise the deck is stacked against them.\" The homepage teaser for York's commentary - \"Radical Makeover\" - says it all.</p> <p>York is not wrong. Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/03/10/080310fa_fact_collins\">Lauren Collins wrote a profile of Michelle Obama</a> for the New Yorker that was largely sympathetic, but that also portrayed her as someone whose campaign portfolio included appearing before African-American audiences and indulging in the sort of racial grievances that her husband eschews.</p> <p>Then there is the Obamas' long, long association with the Rev Jeremiah <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Story?id=4443788\">\"God Damn America!\"</a> Wright. Even if it can never be shown that Barack Obama was sitting in the pews for one of Wright's more unhinged sermons, it is simply not credible to believe the Obamas didn't know what kind of church they belonged to and what Wright stood for - the good, yes, but the bad as well.</p> <p>What we're seeing, I think, is a smart, charismatic couple who charted a route to power and influence within liberal and African-American circles, only to discover rather suddenly that they had set the bar way too low for themselves. Hanging out with folks such as Wright and fossilised 60s radicals like <a href=\"http://blog.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2008/02/obamas_weatherman_connection.html\">William Ayers</a>, and occasionally throwing some racially charged red meat to your long-suffering black constituents, is good politics if you think your ceiling is Chicago and Illinois. It's not good politics at all if you want to be president.</p> <p>Like all successful politicians, Barack Obama is a bit of a chameleon, taking on the characteristics of his environment. So, too, is Michelle Obama. Who is the authentic Michelle Obama, the fiery speaker of May or the smiling mother of August? Both. And before you condemn some of her more inflammatory rhetoric, keep in mind that she is, in fact, a black woman who, we can be sure, has experienced her fair share of racism - perhaps more than her husband has, given his unusual personal journey.</p> <p>I began by saying I find some of this troubling. What I mean is that I find it troubling in a political sense. The choices the Obamas made don't bother me, mainly because I expect politicians to act like politicians, and I am rarely disappointed. But I don't think the Obamas have adequately explained their choices to uncommitted voters. Moreover, I don't think they can.</p> <p>Despite the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/03/18/obama-race-speech-read-t_n_92077.html\">terrific speech Obama delivered on race</a> following the first wave of the Wright controversy, Obama's overall behaviour concerning that relationship - including his decision, finally, to <a href=\"http://www.blog.newsweek.com/blogs/stumper/archive/2008/04/29/obama-throws-wright-under-the-bus-runs-him-over-puts-the-vehicle-in-reverse-and-repeats.aspx\">break all ties with Wright</a> - has been transparently phoney. (Not to say that Obama and Wright remain buddies in secret. Their falling-out, I'm sure, is genuine.)</p> <p>The truth is that Wright was useful to Obama at one time but became a liability once Obama decided to go national. I don't mean to come off as quite that cynical. No doubt the bond between the Obamas and Wright was genuinely strong at one time, and Wright seemed to go out of his way to invite a rupture this past spring. But, again, like nearly all successful politicians, Obama has a not-very-admirable tendency to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/us/politics/11chicago.html?ex=1369368000&amp;en=f844d39696611e35&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\">use people</a> and then <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/07/21/080721fa_fact_lizza\">move on</a>.</p> <p>By trying to reinvent themselves as thoroughly as they have, the Obamas risk coming off as inauthentic, and of being pilloried as hypocrites. The truth, I suspect, is that they both harbour some sense of racial resentment, but that it's just a small part of who they are. And they have decided that Americans can't handle the truth. And they may be right.</p> <p>But by pretending to be just a little too perfect, they've put themselves at some risk. For one thing, you can bet that Jeremiah Wright is merely on hiatus, and will make a splashy return this fall, either on his own or through Republican attack ads. For another, York's exercise today is merely a more intellectually rigorous version of what the likes of Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh deliver every day, as they continually bash away at Michelle Obama for saying she was <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,331288,00.html\">\"proud\" of her country</a> for the first time, among other alleged transgressions.</p> <p>If the McCain campaign and its allies can succeed in portraying the Obamas as angry blacks, that will go a long way toward ensuring Republican victory in November. I'm sceptical that the Obamas can stop them from doing it. And the biggest obstacle is their own past, and their perceived need to deny it.</p>",
  "<p>In India, anyone considered a threat to public order or security of the state can be preventatively locked up under the National Security Act for up to one year without trial or the requirement for the police to produce formal charges in court. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_(Special_Powers)_Act,_1958\">Armed Forces Special Powers Act</a>, operational in areas declared \"disturbed\" (for instance, Manipur and Jammu and Kashmir) gives soldiers licence to shoot to kill anyone breaching a law or official order prohibiting the assembly of five or more persons. Under the <a href=\"http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/document/actandordinances/the_unlawful_activities_act1967.htm\">Unlawful Activities Prevention Act</a>, an accused can be denied the right to proceedings in an open court, which is an essential element of a fair trial. Moreover, the criminal procedure code \u2013 the police officers' and judges' rule book \u2013 prevents courts, without prior permission of the government, from prosecuting public servants for offences committed while \"acting or purporting to act\" in the discharge of official duty. Government permission to prosecute members of law enforcement agencies accused of torture and extrajudicial killings is often, however, not forthcoming. </p> <p>Every year at its <a href=\"http://www.civicusassembly.org/\"> World Assembly</a>, Civicus draws attention to activists imprisoned because of their work as part of the <a href=\"http://www.civicus.org/csw/civilsocietybehindbars/4/441-csbb-uzbekistan-aug08\">Civil Society Behind Bars campaign</a>. This year, the case of <a href=\"http://www.savebinayak.ukaid.org.uk/\">Dr Binayak Sen</a>, vice-president of the <a href=\"http://www.pucl.org/\"> People's Union for Civil Liberties</a>, one of India's most well-respected human rights groups was highlighted before the international community. Sen, detained since May 2006, has <a href=\"http://www.pucl.org/Topics/Human-rights/2006/slawajudum.htm\">worked to expose</a> extrajudicial killings by the police and excesses committed by Salwa Judum, the government sponsored militia in the conflict-ridden state of Chhattisgarh. He stands accused of passing messages to Naxal/Maoist insurgents in prison whom he used to visit as part of his civil society work. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhattisgarh_Special_Public_Security_Act\">Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act</a>, one of the laws under which Sen is charged, contains an overbroad definition of what constitutes an unlawful activity, which can be conveniently invoked to clamp down on the freedom of expression and journalists' rights. Draconian punishment of up to seven years' imprisonment is prescribed under the law for uttering words, writing or making visual representations that create \"risk or danger for public order, peace or public tranquillity\". Moreover, any organisation can be declared unlawful by issuing a government notification. Although, the government is obliged to specify the reasons for declaring an organisation unlawful, it may dispense with this requirement if, in its opinion, it is against the public interest to do so. In May 2008, <a href=\"http://www.releaseajaytg.in/\">Ajay TG</a>, another leading civil liberties activist and journalist who has made a number of films around the themes of poverty and human rights violations was arrested under this law for making contact with an unlawful organisation because he wrote a letter to Maoist insurgents requesting return of his camera, which had been snatched by them on one of his field trips. That the grounds of his arrest were flimsy is borne out by the fact that despite the passage of three months, the police were unable to collect enough evidence to file charges against Ajay, leading to his automatic release on bail on August 5 this year. </p> <p>Although the cases against Sen and Ajay are still pending, a debate on the utility of draconian laws enforced in the name of \"protecting\" the Indian state is long overdue. Proponents of these laws often argue that the country is in the grip of multiple insurgencies seeking to dismember the country, which has also been the target of both indigenous and global terrorist networks. Most civil society groups wholeheartedly agree that terrorism in all it forms must be resolutely countered, but the means employed by constitutional democracies must not violate the core rights and freedoms that are the bedrocks of their society. Only if the means are just can governments hope to defeat those who employ terrorist tactics, while also encouraging disaffected peoples to join the democratic political process.</p>",

  "<p>A multi-option referendum on Scottish independence could be supported by the Scottish Liberal Democrats if it included a question giving the devolved parliament greater powers, the party's new leader has indicated.</p> <p>Tavish Scott, who was elected the party's new leader today by a hefty margin, said he could try to use the proposed referendum in 2010 to give Scots another option: to strengthen the Scottish parliament's existing powers within the UK, short of independence.</p> <p>Scott became leader with almost 60% of the party membership's votes, outstripping his two rivals Ross Finnie, a former environment minister, and backbencher Mike Rumbles by more than two votes to one. </p> <p>The former Lib Dem deputy leader and MSP for Shetland said the result had given him a mandate to lead with \"renewed energy and vigour\". His party has slumped to fourth place in opinion polls and been repeatedly outflanked and overshadowed by the Scottish Tory party since the Holyrood elections in May 2007.</p> <p>Scott told senior party figures, including former Scottish leaders Jim Wallace and his immediate predecessor Nicol Stephen, that his first target would be Alex Salmond's Scottish National party administration. Salmond's opponents believe many of his party's policies and pledges are about to falter because of over-spending.</p> <p>\"After 18 months in government, the SNP are riding high. They're popular but here's my prediction: by 2010, they won't be,\" said Scott. \"You can already see the underlying weaknesses that will undo Alex Salmond. What looks like confidence, surefooted and wily today will seem arrogant, misguided and politically dishonest tomorrow. Spin is the hallmark of this government, but spin has a shelf life.\"</p> <p>Scott's key task is to rebuild the party's influence and stature at Holyrood, where it shared power with Labour in two successive coalition governments until May last year. </p> <p>Despite his confident rhetoric, there were heavy hints today that Scott intends to open talks with Salmond on joint policies, particularly a local income tax and perhaps a constitutional referendum. This would allow him to repeat Tory success in delivering new policies since the election.</p> <p>Salmond's plans for a local income tax have come under sustained attack from business leaders, economists and UK ministers, so Lib Dem support for scrapping the council tax could prove crucial for the SNP's minority government, which holds power on the slimmest of mandates.</p> <p>Scott's price for that could be holding a multi-option referendum on constitutional reform \u2013 a deal that Salmond has previously shown interest in. That could also attract Labour support, since pro-union parties insist the public would vote against full independence.</p> <p>Asked whether he still believed the Lib Dems should oppose the SNP's independence referendum \u2013 his \"red line\" position before last May's elections, Scott told reporters: \"We will see what legislation the SNP comes forward with. I am not intuitively against making sure that people have a choice and opportunity to vote on these things, but I believe it should be for a strengthened Scotland within the UK.\"</p> <p>Nick Clegg, the UK party's leader, said he was \"delighted\" that Scott had been elected. \"He will bring energy and enthusiasm to the role, taking the fight to the SNP and Labour right across Scotland,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Tavish will address the issues that matter most to the people of Scotland, not the narrow-minded squabbles of the nationalists and Labour.\"</p> <p>Scott said his leadership would begin tomorrow with a visit to Glenrothes, the Westminster seat left vacant by the death of the Labour MP John MacDougall. </p> <p>The byelection date has yet to be set, but the Lib Dems said their candidate would be Harry Wills, a local businessman. Labour is due to unveil its candidate next Monday. The byelection is expected to be one of the fiercest fought for some time because it could determine the fate of Gordon Brown's government. </p> <p>It is the neighbouring seat to Brown's constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. And while the SNP are already favourites to win, the Lib Dems still hope to repeat their shock result in 2006 when they beat Labour in Dunfermline and West Fife, the once rock solid Labour seat on the other side of Brown's constituency.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Friday August 29 2008. We have added a paragraph, including a quote from Tavish Scott, to support the assertion that Scott's party may support a multi-option referendum on Scottish independence.</p>",
  "<p>The bubbas over at Compass are <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/article.asp?n=2885\">squealing in ecstasy</a> at the latest opinion poll that shows 67% of the public backing a windfall tax on the energy companies. Perhaps not quite time for the victory lap yet though \u2013 the thought that we only trained <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/economics.alevels\">three economics teachers last year</a> might give pause for thought about the economic literacy of said public. It's also true that we don't in fact do things just because some passing fad has swept through the citizenry: I'm sure that a majority would back stringing up kiddie fiddlers with or without the benefit of trial and no one at all has had the courage to ask us about our continued membership of the European Union for fear of the answer. </p> <p>So the important question becomes is the windfall tax a good idea or not, not whether lots of people support it. The short answer to that question is that no, it isn't a good idea, in fact, it's an extremely bad one.</p> <p>The basics of how markets allocate capital were laid out by Adam Smith all the way back in 1776. Yes, it's old news, even if it still escapes some, and no, there's not been a refutation of this yet, not at the basic level \u2013 even though there have been refinements. Roughly, there's an average level of profit made across the economy. We can complicate this by looking at how it's adjusted for the riskiness of the venture but let's keep it simple for the Compass folk, shall we? So, if some adventure or line of business starts to make more than that average level of profit then our other greedy capitalists are going to make covetous glances at the source of them. They will shift their investments from areas which are getting the average to those where they think they can get more. More capital invested in this line of business will increase the competition there, increase the supply of the goods making such profits, bring down the prices and thus erase those excess profits. Note that the only motivation we're depending upon here is greed: something which around here I should have no problem in persuading people that capitalists have a sufficiency of. </p> <p>The same argument can and is used in reverse to explain the fleeing of capital from those businesses which have a below average profit level: that's what did for all those buggy whip factories.</p> <p>So, staying with simplicity, the energy companies are making excess profits. Well, let's not be quite that simple, there's two very different parts to the energy sector. There are those who distribute it and those who actually drill and pump up the oil and gas. Distribution profits are not currently excessive, indeed, British Gas's arm saw falling profits. It's the parts that drill and pump that are seeing those booming profits on the back of global prices (worth perhaps mentioning that Britsh Gas' production arm already pays 75% of North Sea profits in tax, no?) and this is of course just where we'd like to see more capital investment, more discovery and pumping, more competition and thus a lowering of prices.</p> <p>You'll have noticed that the share prices of the energy production companies have been rising: this means that more people are buying them (quite probably your and my pension funds actually) so capital is indeed moving into this area, seeking those excess profits. Yes, there are also myriad start-ups that are getting funded too (AIM has a whole raft of them). Excellent, the market for capital is working just as we would wish. Changes in supply and or demand have led to changes in price, thus to profits, in the pursuit of which people are investing more in trying to find what we desire, oil and gas at prices we wish to pay. Not a bad system really.</p> <p>Then along come our friends at Compass. They've decided to short circuit this entire system. Instead of excess profits being a signal of shortages, of easy pickings to be made by looking for oil and gas, they've decided to confiscate those profits. Two effects follow: the extant companies have less money to invest in further exploration and the possible new entrants think it not worth the bother as if they do find more they'll not be able to keep their profits. Thus we have a smaller supply of oil and gas in the future ... thus, inevitably, keeping prices higher than they would have been.</p> <p>It takes a certain form of willful stupidity to react to a shortage and the associated high prices by insisting that we should have more of a shortage in the future, doesn't it? The Compass proposal compounds this by arguing that the money so confiscated should be given to the poor so that they can pay their fuel bills: that is, so that they can consume more energy. It takes even more such stupidity to argue that an excess of demand is best dealt with by increasing demand. </p> <p>We have high energy prices, certainly. This is because there are more of us who want to use cheap energy than there is cheap energy around. Prices thus do their magic thing and change so as to balance supply and demand. What we want to do to get out of this bind of high demand and low supply is to increase supply and reduce demand. Those backing a windfall tax and energy subsidies are proposing exactly the opposite. They're suggesting that we can solve high demand and low supply by reducing supply and increasing demand.</p> <p>Sorry, but this is nonsense, nonsense upon stilts.</p>",

  "<p>It's not easy being a progressive \u2013 for want of a better word \u2013 English nationalist. Everybody hates you. People on the left hate you because they think the word \"nationalist\" means you are keen on uniforms and highly-coordinated rallies (perhaps they're confusing us with <a href=\" http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/olympics/2008/08/23/lord-coe-urges-sfa-rethink-over-team-gb-86908-20708614/\">Seb Coe</a>). Meanwhile, people on the right hate you because you're not nationalist enough. </p> <p>In the last few months alone I have been <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/england-britain-and-multiculturalism-an-ourkingdom-debate\">accused</a> by a leftwing enthusiast for multiculturalism of being \"complicit with racism\", and by a far-right \"ethnic nationalist\" (read: white supremacist) of being a \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/gordonbrown.scotland\">race traitor</a>\". And those are the edited highlights. It makes you want to give up. </p> <p>But I'm not going to, for the simple reason that if I do, these people win. And besides, I think we may be rapidly approaching a moment \u2013 modishly known these days as a \"tipping point\" \u2013 when the \"English question\" may become a mainstream concern.</p> <p>I won't explain the question again \u2013 I've done it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/30/northfendingofftheenglish\">here before</a> and many others have done it <a href=\"http://toque.co.uk/blog/\">elsewhere</a>. Suffice it to say that England is the only one of the four UK nations without a government, and that this is causing real problems. Problems that people on the left ought to have a very real stake in tackling. </p> <p>Those problems can be broken down into two categories: cultural and political. <a href=\"http://realengland.blogspot.com/\">Culturally</a>, England losing the things that link its people to their historical culture, and which ground that culture in the present, at a frightening rate. They are being replaced by the grubby detritus of global corporate consumerism, whose purpose is to turn us into placeless, listless consumers rather than rooted, concerned citizens.</p> <p>Politically, because the English, unlike the Scottish, the Welsh or the people of Northern Ireland, have no political focus for their concerns, they have nowhere to turn to express them. What can happen when such a focus does exist can be seen north of the border. The last decade has seen a transformation of Scotland, as a direct result of the creation of a Scottish parliament. Politicians there are now forced to directly address Scottish concerns. There is a Scottish political class, a Scottish media, a Scottish arts scene. The same is true in Wales, whose politicians are focusing on, among other things, the rebirth of the Welsh language and the teaching of Welsh culture in schools. </p> <p>The English, meanwhile, are governed by unelected regional assemblies, directed by a prime minister elected in Scotland. Their children are taught \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6535089.stm\">Britishness</a>\" at school. The British government, currently personified by a man so obsessed with \"Britishness\" he even wants a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/football/7580466.stm\">GB football team</a>, seems to have an allergic reaction to all things English. There is no mainstream English political party. Consequently, English concerns have no repository save the BNP and the Daily Mail. </p> <p>Which is why I won't be giving up any time soon. What the English need is their own parliament; one that matches Scotland's in power and purpose. At a stroke, this would transform the landscape. The English would have somewhere to turn, and an institution that reflected their concerns. They would be forced to put their money where their mouth is and decide how their country should be run. Best of all, an English parliament would destroy the influence of the far right at a stroke. They, too, would have to put up or shut up. They would soon find out how marginal their true support is without the sense of frustration that currently feeds it. </p> <p>Still in doubt? Still wondering what this has to do with your instincts as a \"progressive\"? Consider this. The British government has announced its intention to create a <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/blog/ourkingdom-theme/guy-aitchison/2008/08/12/parliaments-proposals-on-a-new-bill-of-rights\">UK bill of rights</a>, codifying the rights of all its citizens. The latest report on this proposal suggests that, once the UK-wide bill is completed, the governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland should be able, if they so wish, to add extra rights of their own, for the benefit of their citizens. And the English? We'll be stuck with what New Labour has given us. </p> <p>Fewer rights for the English! Doesn't sound like much of a rallying cry, does it? If it's one that doesn't appeal to you, you might want to think about supporting the growing <a href=\"http://www.thecep.org.uk/wordpress/\">calls for democracy</a> for England. Your support comes with the added bonus of undermining, not to mention infuriating, the racist loons who have been claiming England for their own for far too long. </p> <p>Sounds pretty progressive to me.</p>",

  "<p>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, the French bank brought low by rogue trader J\u00e9r\u00f4me<br>Kerviel, is bucking the trend among its European peers today by launching a worldwide campaign to recruit 20,000 more staff.</p> <p>The group, which employs 151,000 people globally, is seeking 600 new recruits immediately in France, where it expects to take on around 5500 staff this year in its three divisions, including investment banking, where Kerviel worked.</p> <p>SocGen's campaign comes as analysts predict that the City alone will dispose of between 20,000 and 40,000 jobs by the end of next year because of the credit crunch. </p> <p>Investment banks have already shed thousands of jobs. UBS, the Swiss bank that has become Europe's biggest victim of the sub-prime crisis, is slashing its salaries and bonuses bill by a third - \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a32.1bn) - in response to the deteriorating outlook. It shed 2387 staff in the second quarter, most of them (1700) in investment banking. SocGen has tripled its headcount in the past decade, partly through acquisitions, and took on 19,000 recruits last year, more than offsetting the 13,500 who left the bank.</p> <p>A bank spokeswoman said the recruitment campaign belied suggestions that SocGen would embark on a serious retrenchment in the wake of the Kerviel scandal - which cost it close to \u20ac5bn - and its franchise remained unimpaired. The bank's profits recovered in the second quarter, reaching \u20ac1.25bn, despite a 20% slump in revenues and a rise in operating expenses.</p> <p>Swiss rival UBS said earlier this month it had slashed its operating expenses by 18% in the second quarter, with personnel costs down 36% on a year earlier to Sfr10bn (\u00a34.9). Germany's Deutsche Bank cut its salaries bill by 31% to \u20ac2.7bn as it slashed bonuses.</p>",
  "<p>There are windfall gains and windfall gains. The ones being made at the moment by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/31/centricabusiness.gas\">British energy companies</a> are as nothing in comparison with those enjoyed by the world's fossil fuel producers. These are so great that they are causing the world economy to collapse. </p> <p>Both gains are as a result of scarcity. The supply of oil has not been able to keep up with world demand. This has pushed up prices and delivered enormous profits because most currently-active oilfields were developed on the assumption that the price of oil would be about $20 a barrel, whereas it is now <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hv5NYWv5MbU298eR5DnMQVll0ssg\">six times that</a>. </p> <p>If one increases the $20 figure to $30 to allow for inflation, more than half of the $1.9tn which was paid for oil last year when oil averaged $64.20 a barrel was actually \"scarcity rent\", the term economists use to refer to the extra people are forced to pay when something is in short supply. The rent amounted to around $1tn, roughly 2% of gross world product. Coal and gas producers also received rental payments but the oil rent alone worked out at $151 for everyone on Earth. </p> <p>If we assume that the average oil price this year has been around $120, the scarcity rent the oil producers are getting amounts to 6% of everything being produced in the world. </p> <p>The problem with that is that the producers are not buying and consuming anything like that part of the world's production. Instead, they are either lending the rent out through the wholesale money markets or using it to buy stakes in banks or property in heavily oil-dependent countries. </p> <p>An energy supply system is only sustainable if the people who buy energy this year can somehow, directly or indirectly, earn back the amount they paid to the producers so that they can purchase energy again next year. This is not happening. The money the oil producers invest in, say, a British or US bank needing a capital injection is not spent back into people's wage packets. Instead it, together with the money passed through the wholesale money markets, is lent back to consumers and, for a little while, enables them to continue to buy fuel. </p> <p>But there is a limit to the amount people can afford to borrow, and when that limit is reached this money recycling system breaks down. Besides being unable to buy so much energy, people have less to spend on everything else as well. </p> <p>Sales slow and investment projects, which are usually very energy hungry, dry up. Unemployment increases, contributing to the fall in energy demand. Energy prices drop sharply. It is therefore in the interests of both the fuel producers and their customers to find a way of recycling the scarcity rent to the people from whom it came. </p> <p>One possible way of doing this has been developed by an organisation through which I work, <a href=\"http://www.feasta.org/\">Feasta</a>, the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability, based in Dublin. It's called <a href=\"http://www.capandshare.org/howitworks.html\">cap and share</a> and has the advantage that it could also provide a framework for a global climate treaty. </p> <p>In brief, a world energy agency would cut global greenhouse emissions faster than world oil production declined. It would do this by issuing permits each year for the CO2 emissions tonnage it had decided to allow to be released. The permits would be shared equally by every adult on the planet.</p> <p>In the first year, we'd each get certificates for about four tonnes which we would sell to a bank or a post office. These financial intermediaries would sell them on to the fossil-fuel producers who would need to buy enough to cover the emissions from the fuels they intended to sell.</p> <p>Making the permits scarcer than the supply of fuel means that those selling them capture a share of the scarcity rent rather than seeing it go to the fuel producers. People in the poorer, low-energy-using parts of the world would come out very well, even after they had paid the higher costs for their fuel and food. By contrast, those living in an energy-intensive way would find they had to pay for the privilege as the income from sale of their emissions permits would not cover their extra costs.</p> <p>Essentially, cap and share is a way of spreading the benefits of using the limited supply of fossil fuel that's available, or that we permit ourselves to burn. Ideas about what is fair \u2013 and realistic \u2013 differ of course and many people find cap and share hopelessly utopian. But as 80% of the world's energy is used by 20% of its human population, most of the world would benefit financially if it was introduced. </p> <p>Indeed, we'd all gain, as it would rectify a serious flaw in the global monetary system and, if the cap set was tightly enough, save us from setting off a catastrophic, irreversible climate change. Does anyone have a better idea?</p>",
  "<p>Wall Street's fall out of bed overnight has pulled down London shares, with the FTSE 100 index down more than 80 points at lunchtime. </p> <p>The sense of gloom has been deepened this side of the pond by the latest barometer of German corporate sentiment from the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute. Its research shows that German business became markedly more pessimistic in August, certainly much more so than analysts had expected.</p> <p>Worries about the global economy continue to pull down commodity prices, leaving metal and mining stocks the biggest losers in the early session.

Photograph: Stephen Moss</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Moss/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'm on a quest for one of Britain's smallest, rarest and most obscure butterflies, the <a href=\"http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/species.php?vernacular_name=Lulworth%20Skipper\">Lulworth skipper</a>.</p> <p>Although this species is common in Europe, it still has the name given to it by the 19th century collector who first discovered it on the chalk hills above <a href=\"http://www.lulworthonline.co.uk/\">Lulworth Cove</a>, the famous Dorset beauty-spot. Almost two centuries later, the entire British range of this tiny butterfly barely extends beyond these coastal cliffs and headlands.</p> <p>But I am too late in the day, or too late in the season, or both; and despite searching intensively for an hour I fail to see the skipper. I do, however, find a trio of delicate chalkland butterflies, all from the group known as \"blues\". <br><a href=\"http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/species.php?vernacular_name=Common%20Blue\"><br>Common blues </a>are everywhere \u2013 some of them looking pretty tatty this late in their flight season. Then a paler butterfly lands in front of me, and opens its wings to reveal powder-blue upper wings with a thick black border: it's the aptly-named <a href=\"http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/species.php?vernacular_name=\" chalkhill%20blue\">chalkhill blue</a>.</p> <p>Finally, the third in the set appears: an altogether more striking creature with electric-blue upperwings, the <a href=\"http://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/species.php?vernacular_name=adonis%20blue\">Adonis blue</a>. I recall from my hazy knowledge of Greek mythology that Adonis was famed for his handsome appearance \u2013 and this stunning butterfly clearly fits the bill.</p> <p>By the end of my search I have tallied eight different species, which added to the five I saw earlier in the day on <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/brownsea/\">Brownsea Island</a> makes a creditable 13. But this variety masks an uncomfortable truth: that numbers of individual butterflies are well down this summer \u2013 not just here in Dorset but <a href=\"http://www.butterfly-conservation.org/\">right across the country</a>.<br> According to my friend and mentor <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-countryside_environment/w-nature/w-nature-wildlife/w-nature-wildlife-butterflies_moths/w-nature-wildlife-butterflies-butterfly_man.htm\">Matthew Oates</a> of the National Trust, whose lifelong passion for butterflies makes mine look like a passing whim, this is the worst year for Britain's butterflies since he began watching them 45 years ago. I'm a recent convert to these beautiful creatures, so this rather depresses me: it's a bit like starting to support a once-great football team now relegated to the lower divisions.</p> <p>But are the glory days for the UK's butterflies really over, or can they rise again? After all, the main reason for the lack of butterflies \u2013 both this year and last \u2013 is the terrible summer weather. Wind and rain reduce the time available for the insects to feed, and also batter their delicate wings. This shortens their lifespan and makes them more vulnerable to predators. </p> <p>Ironically, the medium-term climatic forecast is for longer, hotter summers \u2013 so won't butterflies simply bounce back? Well, yes and no. Prolonged drought can be just as bad for butterflies as downpours; but on the brighter side, warmer temperatures overall will allow \u2013 indeed are already allowing \u2013 species like the peacock and comma to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2003/jun/07/science.research\">extend their ranges northwards</a>. </p> <p>The downside with climate change \u2013 at least if past form is any guide \u2013 is that common, adaptable species are likely to do well, while rare, specialised creatures will do badly. We'll just have to wait and see: though we do know that butterflies' conspicuous habits and short lifecycle mean that they are just about the best indicator we have of rapid environmental change. </p> <p>Meanwhile my four-year-old son Charlie has become an expert with the butterfly net, his young reactions much better than my own, middle-aged ones. When I got home after my unsuccessful quest for the Lulworth skipper he proudly showed me four collecting boxes, each containing a single butterfly. After taking a close look we released them back into the garden. </p> <p>And the large <a href=\"http://www.habitas.org.uk/moths/larva.asp?item=5522\">white caterpillars</a> we are breeding are getting fatter by the day, much to the children's delight. Only one drawback \u2013 guess who has to clear out their prodigious daily output of poo\u2026?</p> <p>\u00b7 Matthew Oates is a guest for Butterfly Week on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/theoneshow\">The One Show</a>, from August 25-29 at 7pm on BBC One</p>",
  "<p>Along with the piles of dirty laundry, empty beer cans and Bob Marley posters they are a common feature of many student digs. But scientists have now found that regularly burning joss sticks increases the risk of certain mouth, throat and lung cancers.</p> <p>The 12-year study backs up previous research showing that incense smoke contains cancer-causing chemicals such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, carbonyls and benzene, which cause mutations to DNA in human cells. Another study found that the levels of airborne particulates from candles and incense burning in two Dutch churches were 20 times higher than they were next to a typical busy road.</p> <p>\"Incense is sold without a warning label, and given the high prevalence of use and the often involuntary nature of the exposure, clarifying the role of incense smoke as a carcinogen is important from a public health perspective,\" wrote Dr Jeppe Friborg of the Statens Serum Institute in Copenhagen and his colleagues in the latest issue of the journal Cancer.</p> <p>The team interviewed over 60,000 ethnic Chinese people in Singapore aged between 45 and 78 between 1993 and 1998. They asked how much they used incense and collected detailed information on their lifestyle including their diet and how much they drank alcohol and smoked. All participants who had previously had cancer were excluded from the analysis.</p> <p>In December 2005, the team checked the subjects' health by using the detailed records in Singapore's National Cancer Registry. Of the original group, 325 had developed cancer of the upper respiratory tract and 821 had developed lung cancer. </p> <p>After adjusting for other lifestyle factors that are known to cause cancer, such as smoking, the team found that burning incense was associated with an increase in some types of lung cancer, and cancers of the upper respiratory tract, such as throat and mouth cancer. </p> <p>The small risk of developing upper respiratory tract cancers nearly doubled in people who used incense regularly. They were also more common among women, which could be explained by the fact that women tend to spend more time in the smoky home environment.</p> <p>Friborg said that the implications went beyond this particular study group. \"It could be relevant for priests and others who are regularly exposed to incense,\" he said, \"[but] I'm not sure if a short term effect would be measurable.\"</p> <p>He added that it was too early to consider attaching health warnings to packets of joss sticks or incense. \"I would suggest that people use incense with caution,\" he said. \"If this study is confirmed I think regulation could be relevant.\"</p>",

  "<p>The Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, has called for US and EU sanctions to punish Russia for invading Georgia, including a boycott of Russia's 2014 winter Olympics.</p> <p>Saakashvili said \"developed countries\" faced a \"moral choice\" whether to participate in the winter Olympics, which are to be held in Sochi on the Black Sea. The town is 10 miles away from Abkhazia \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/georgia.russia\">a breakaway region of Georgia involved in fighting this month</a>. </p> <p>\"I was the biggest supporter of the Olympics. I thought it would calm Russia down. But the fact they got it emboldened them,\" Saakashvili said in a late-night interview with the Guardian. \"I think it's a moral choice for developed countries.\"</p> <p>The Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, has been closely associated with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/05/russia.world\">Russia's successful winter Olympic bid </a>. Any move by the International Olympic Committee to strip Sochi of the games would be a severe humiliation for Putin. Several US members of congress are calling on the IOC to act.</p> <p>Saakashvili said Sochi was next to a disputed territory and a conflict zone. It would be \"most cynical\" to hold the games near Abkhazia \u2013 which he said was the venue for \"ethnic cleansing\" of Georgians during the civil war in the early 1990s and in Upper Abkhazia this month.</p> <p>Russia has so far adopted a nonchalant attitude to the threat of possible western sanctions, with its president, Dmitry Medvedev, saying it would be \"no great loss\" if Nato carried out its threat to cut ties with Russia. The EU is holding a special meeting on Monday to discuss its future relations with Moscow.</p> <p>This morning, Saakashvili said the international community should take more flexible measures aimed at forcing Russia to pull its troops out of Georgia. These could include visa bans for Russian officials wanting to holiday in western Europe and Britain, and the freezing of their Swiss bank accounts, he said.</p> <p>\"This guy [Putin] thinks that statements don't mean anything and that the west will always blink first. But they [the Russian elite] have all their money in the west. They get very depressed if they are mistreated in [the French ski resort of] Courchevel,\" Saakashvili said.</p> <p>Saakashvili said he had been in frequent contact with global leaders since Russia's invasion of Georgia on August 8. He had spoken to France's president, Nicholas Sarkozy, \"15 times\" and had had at least \"nine or 10 conversations\" with George Bush.</p> <p>Britain's prime minister, Gordon Brown, had phoned him only once, he said. Saakashvili lavishly praised the Conservative leader, David Cameron, who visited Tbilisi last week. \"Cameron was very good. He really got the value side of it very well,\" Saakashvili said.</p> <p>Russia was determined to replace his pro-western government with a pro-Russian regime, he said. \"They want to get rid of this government and undermine Georgian independence. Their aim is to get a normal government subordinate to them. It would send a very powerful message.\"</p> <p>Speaking in his presidential office, Saakashvili said the war in Georgia was far more than a regional dispute between a larger and a smaller neighbour. \"They (the Russians) have fought a war by proxy with Nato. It's about great Russia coming back and confronting the horrible west that humiliated Russia.</p> <p>\"It's about the reassertion of the Soviet Union.\"</p> <p>Saakashvili said he had little choice but to launch a military incursion into South Ossetia on August 7. He claimed that Russian tanks were already rolling into Georgian territory when he gave the order to attack. His decision followed the repeated shelling by South Ossetia of Georgian villages, he said. \"We acted out of despair.\"</p> <p>Russia withdrew its troops on Friday from the strategic town of Gori but still occupies much of the country. Saakashvili said he was alarmed by the capture by South Ossetian militias of the town of Akhalgori, 25 miles north-west of Tbilisi. The militias had seized a nearby vantage point from where they could shell the capital, he said.</p> <p>So far Georgia had abided by the ceasefire deal and had not tried to fight the occupying Russians, he said. This would change if Moscow attempted to seize Tbilisi, he said, and warned a new invasion by Moscow was highly probable. \"We are in a very precarious situation,\" he said.</p> <p>Saakashvili shrugged off claims that the war had erupted out of personal enmity between him and Putin. \"I never had any personal hatred towards him. Apparently he did [towards me],\" Saakashvili said.</p>",

Campaigners and politicians condemn the practice as unethical and unnecessary, and say Japan's \"scientific\" whaling programme is commercial whaling by another name.</p> <p>Now, Japan's scientists claim their controversial whaling programme has produced a key finding. Measurements taken from more than 4,500 minke whales slaughtered since the late 1980s reveal the animals have lost significant amounts of blubber, and are getting thinner at a worrying speed. The team says its study offers the first evidence that global warming could be harming whales, because it restricts their food supplies. And they say the discovery could only have been made by killing the animals.</p> <p>Crucially for the Japanese, the results have been published in a mainstream western scientific journal \u2013 a move that has dismayed campaigners, who say it could offer scientific whaling a veneer of respectability, and bolster Japan's efforts to hunt more whales. </p> <p>They fear Japan could use the results to support efforts to hunt endangered humpback whales for the first time in 50 years. The study claims the recovering humpback population in the Southern Ocean could also be hurting the minkes because of \"interference\" between the two species as they compete for food.</p> <p>Lars Walloe, a Norwegian whale expert at the University of Oslo, who helped the Japanese team analyse the data, and is listed as an author on the new study, said: \"This is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive. It indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem.\"</p> <p>Whales rely on their thick layer of blubber for energy and as insulation against the cold water. The shift could already being making it more difficult for them to reproduce, Walloe said. \"I don't think you could measure this by other [non lethal] means.\" Alternative methods to sample blubber, such as ultrasound and biopsy darts, have been developed. But Walloe said it was not practical to use them on the required scale with minke whales, which are also difficult to approach.</p> <p>He said the Japanese findings, and their publication, had been unpopular among scientists from nations opposed to whaling, including Britain. Two journals refused to print the findings before they were accepted by <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/3332u050u9116r73/?p=fdd631b8ce02475682806582e35541fd&amp;pi=8\">Polar Biology</a>, which published them online last month. Walloe, who says he does not support the current ban on commercial whaling, claimed that the journals that turned down the study did so for political, not scientific, reasons. </p> <p>This is not the first time that the Japanese scientific whaling programme has published results, but these are the most high-profile findings so far. In 2005, Australian scientists analysed the 55 scientific papers produced by the programme and said only a handful were relevant and required the whales to have been killed. The others included descriptions of bizarre experiments to cross-fertilise whales with sheep and cows.</p> <p>The new study analysed measurements taken from 4,689 adult whales killed by the Japanese whaling fleet between 1988 and 2005. It found that blubber thickness and overall fat weight had decreased by 9% over the period, which it called a 'substantial decline\". Girth of the animals was down 4%. The study says: \"This is the first time a long-term decline in energy storage in minke whales has been demonstrated.\" </p> <p>It also demonstrates the brutality of whaling, which the paper describes as carried out using \"explosive harpoons and a large calibre rifle in the event that death was not instantaneous\". Several of the dead whales had to be excluded from the new analysis because their blubber was too badly damaged to be measured accurately.</p> <p>Mark Simmonds, director of science at the <a href=\"http://www.wdcs.org.uk/\">Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society</a>, said: \"Lots of dead bodies will provide robust data, so if you kill lots of whales then you will be able to get some information. The question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed. Scientific whaling is not about science, and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it to be done.\"</p> <p>He said the results should not have been published on ethical grounds. \"Journals need to think very carefully about information that comes from this source. Different journals have different ethical standards.\" The editors of Polar Biology could not be reached for comment. British whale scientists were reluctant to discuss the research, which one described as \"very worrying if true\".</p> <p>Walloe said the decline in blubber was down to shrinking numbers of Antarctic krill, a shrimp-like crustacean at the heart of the food chain. The amount of blubber lost is roughly equivalent to 36 fewer days of intensive summer feeding. </p> <p>Krill numbers in the water around the rapidly-warming Antarctic peninsula have collapsed by about 80% since the 1970s. This is blamed on the loss of sea ice, which provide shelter and food for krill.</p> <p>The study says the impact of global warming on the minke whales is unclear because no similar krill measurements have been made in that region of the Southern Ocean. But it claims that competition for krill from other predators such as the humpback must also be \"considered as a likely explanation\". </p> <h2>Science and slaughter</h2> <p>Japan's scientific whaling programme, known as JARPA, began in 1987 following the moratorium on commercial whaling. Japan says its research is aimed at overturning the ban, by providing evidence that stocks could be hunted in a sustainable way. </p> <p>Critics say it is limited commercial whaling in disguise because the meat is sold for food, and that whales do not need to die to provide the required information on population numbers and structure. Until 2005, Japan killed up to 440 minke whales in the Southern Ocean each summer. Recently it has doubled that quota, and last year said it would hunt dozens of endangered fin and humpback whales for the first time in decades, until it backed down \"temporarily\" under intense political pressure. </p> <p>Until now, the most high-profile claim from the programme was that whales should be killed to conserve fish stocks \u2013 an idea ridiculed by fisheries experts.</p>",
  "<p>Belfast-based media group UTV has reported a revenue rise of 8% in the first half of 2008, with a 4% decline in TV ad income offset by solid growth from radio, led by TalkSport.</p> <p>UTV, which owns the ITV Northern Ireland franchise, saw pre-tax profit rise by 12% year on year to \u00a310.4m, with operating profits up 32% year on year to \u00a39.9m.</p> <p>However, operating profits for UTV's TV operation fell 15% year on year to \u00a34.7m on a fall in ad revenue for the period of 4%, to \u00a318.3m.</p> <p>UTV said it expected to \"reverse\" the comparative underperformance of its TV operation in the third quarter of 2008, forecasting an ad revenue decline of 5% year on year.

  "<p> Unlike the film industry, where the superstar system ensures that personalities abound, there aren't many legends in computer games development. One person who does stand out, however, is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_McGee\">former id designer</a> <a href=\"http://www.americanmcgee.com/\">American McGee</a>, whose unusual name and raft of quirky, Tim Burton-esque titles ensure that people keep watch on what he's doing.</p> <p>Currently living in Shanghai and trickling out <a href=\"http://www.gametap.com/grimm/\">Grimm</a>, his latest anarchic opus based loosely on the fairy tales of the Brothers of the same name, the gamesblog tracked him down to find out where the other auteurs are, what it takes to be a free spirit in an industry obsessed with the bottom line, and what he's learned living in China.</p> <p><strong>Explain <a href=\"http://www.gametap.com/grimm/\">Grimm</a> to my mum.</strong> Grimm is a video game presented like a television show. The \"host\" is a crabby dwarf named Grimm who's had enough of fairy tales made too sweet by modern day political correctness. He longs for a time when fairy tales meant something, when they had teeth, contained lessons, and could frighten good behavior out of bad children. Each week he re-introduces a well-known tale in its current-day, toothless form. He then invites the player to help him return it to a grimmer state.</p> <p>The game play of Grimm is designed to be highly accessible - you \"paint\" darkness on the world by running around. Everything in the world can transform, the rocks and trees to the birds and bees convert from wholesome to horrific. When the work's done Grimm once again presents the tale. But this time things are more to his liking: Justice is served, naivety and bad deeds are punished, and all's well that ends up dead.</p> <p>In total there are 24 episodes of Grimm, delivered in a unique weekly fashion. You can get the episodes for FREE during the first 24 hours after their weekly launch, just like television. After that you can still play the game using a variety of pay methods, either via GameTap's site or other digital distribution partners.</p> <p><strong>Your games have a distinctive style and a dark humour that's unusual in games. Where do you get your inspiration?</strong> My childhood was bizarre and often scary. I was fed an odd mix of media, real life drama, and travel. I suppose the heavy rotation of Jacques Cousteau and Monte Python took its toll. These days I take inspiration mostly from the artist and creators that surround me at work. We've assembled an eclectic bunch here in Shanghai. People from around the world, with a variety of odd background, all intent on expressing themselves through games. Nothing better than collaborating with a group of interesting and odd people to get truly inspired.</p> <p><strong>Which distribution model encourages the most creativity? Why?</strong> A finance and distribution model that allows an audience time to find a product is best. The current retail box-product model suffers not because of the distribution - but because of the limited availability of shelf space at the retail outlets. Scarcity of shelf space means a game must perform exceptionally well - beating out all other competitors for shelf space - the moment it hits the shelves or be considered a failure. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, relegating good games to obscurity, and limiting customer choice.</p> <p>A publisher who funds and distributes with digital distribution in mind, creates an environment where creativity can be encouraged. Designers aren't forced to fit into pre-defined genre slots or to focus on \"me-too\" designs that kowtow to market expectations. Bigger risks can be taken on smaller projects. And successful small projects can be expanded on when appropriate.</p> <p>In general the industry needs more forms of incubators.</p> <p><strong>Where do you see the most creativity in gaming coming from? Are there any people/studios you keep an eye on?</strong> It seems that a lot of the most successful creativity is being expressed in smaller format games and (as is the case with the Wii) on innovative platforms. Studios that embrace alternates, be it in distribution, development methods, interface devices, or explore other untested concepts in gaming, tend to produce the most interesting content. I'm particularly interested in things coming out of Nintendo, Media Molecule, Telltale, GameTap, Valve, and EA Partners. Each of these groups is helping to reshape various aspects of game development, distribution, interface, and financing.</p> <p><strong>You've developed a reputation as a creative and Tim Burton-esque developer: an independent spirit with big budget funding. Why is this so unusual in the industry?</strong> Independent spirit maybe, big budget funding barely. But the budgets (as long as they aren't painfully limiting) aren't the point. I think my reputation (good and bad) has come from the fact I've been consistently unusual in my approach to development (location, methodology), storytelling (themes, characters), and the presence of my name in association with the game titles. People know to expect the unexpected. Compared with other (perhaps wiser?) developers and studios who strive for consistent, if somewhat repetitive, development and market performance, I'm more interested in testing new ideas.</p> <p><strong>Looking back at your career, where do you think you learned the most, in terms of the skills you have today?</strong> A lot of the foundation came from id - the understanding of the dedication and creativity needed to produce good games. The business understanding came in part from the time I spent with EA, and also in large part from the time I've spent as an independent developer. But the hardest and best lessons certainly came with the development of my last game, Bad Day LA. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong, and I walked away with a mountain of lessons. Until the point that development skidded off the track and crashed I held in my mind that any problem, no matter how big, could be solved - any broken project fixed. Perhaps true when there's unlimited time and resources - but the reality of the world outside places like id and EA is that things can just break beyond fixing. The realization of that fact has increased my respect for good planning and management as well as my admiration for solid game development teams in general.</p> <p>I'm still learning a huge amount every day - thanks to being in Shanghai, starting a new studio, and working on some innovative projects like Grimm. Being here is a challenge on every level - culturally, linguistically, and physically. Nothing can be taken for granted, everything must be proven and re-proven - from handling of company finances and planning, to development processes, team building, and interface with the local community. Thankfully, all these challenges are interesting and very rewarding.</p> <p><strong>You currently live in Shanghai. How have you been influenced by that culture in your game designs and development styles?</strong> It's had a tremendous impact on my development style. Living in China has made me more respectful of the limited nature of things: time, resources, and energy. It has impressed upon me the importance of process, clear communication, and strong team culture. And it has really opened my eyes to the chemistry of people - human nature, personality types, and shared expectations. All of this has driven me to take a very personal and humanistic approach to how the studio has grown and our projects are planned.</p> <p>As the development environment in China is still new and has a lot of growing to do, I think one of the most important things our studio can do to influence the future is to illustrate a more human approach to development. With that in mind we plan and prioritize to avoid overtime and \"crunch\" work. We emphasize health and rest as keys to higher productivity and creativity. And we encourage openness and communication between people and departments as a way of working more effectively.</p> <p>Our games are of course impacted by exposure to the environment here. Now that we're starting work on a game specifically designed for the China market I see myself leveraging the past 4 years of language, culture, and understanding into the game concept, design, and creative direction. It's an odd thing to be a foreigner building games for the Chinese market - but so far, so good. We're having a lot of fun, learning a lot, and I hope bringing to life something rewarding for our team and our audience.</p> <p><strong>What will be the next revolution in gaming?</strong> I think we'll continue to see updated interface devices at the forefront of the mini-revolutions in the years to come. Ultimately, I think this is all heading to one uber-revolution in the shape of seamless computer-human interfaces, ala \"The Matrix\". It'll be great to get away from the dated keyboard/mouse, monitor, speakers way of interfacing with our content. As soon as someone starts offering trial \"implant\" testing - I'll be first in line. I just hope I don't crash my brain, it would take a lifetime to reinstall everything.</p> <p><em>You can get the first episode of Grimm for free from <a href=\"http://www.GameTap.com\">GameTap</a>.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/forests\">Forests</a> and peatlands have a unique role to play in the battle against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climatechange\">climate change</a>. Living forests and peatlands can sequester carbon emissions, while dying ones release previously stored carbon. Every year the annihilation of these two habitats generates more greenhouse gas than every car, truck, train and plane on earth. This is roughly the same as the amount of CO2 that is emitted by the United States or China each year.</p> <p>Politicians and policymakers too frequently ignore this critical area. Yes, it is vital that we reduce our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbonemissions\">greenhouse gas emissions</a> in the UK, by changing behaviour, improving <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energyefficiency\">energy efficiency</a>, investing in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy\">renewables</a> and bringing forward new low-carbon technologies. But, it is impossible to prevent dangerous climate change by doing this alone. If forest and peatland destruction continues unabated, we will never be able to stop climate change. </p> <p>In our report published by Policy Exchange and entitled, The Root of the Matter: Carbon Sequestration in Forests and Peatlands, we argue that preventing deforestation and stopping peatland destruction are some of the cheapest and most effective ways of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. These methods of reducing emissions are dramatically cheaper than all other mitigation options currently available \u2013 as low as US$0.1 per tonne of CO2.</p> <p>Fortunately, stopping their destruction can be done comparatively quickly and cheaply. Moreover, the prevention of deforestation and peatland destruction requires no technological development and little capital investment. These are important factors as we enter a prolonged economic downturn. </p> <p>The economics is startling \u2013 if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on biofuel subsidies (US$15bn), this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change. In addition, the protection of these habitats yields a plethora of valuable ecosystem services, particularly in the poorest countries. </p> <p>In the UK alone, biofuel subsidies cost \u00a3550 million annually. In 2005, a similar investment in preventing deforestation and peatland destruction could have offset the equivalent of up to 37% of all UK CO2 emissions. Yet current government policy places no value on protecting forests and peatlands. </p> <p>In our report, we propose the introduction of market mechanisms that can ensure investment is directed into forest and peatland conservation, as well as a strategy to make this happen as quickly as possible. To be truly effective, a global response is needed, but the UK has an opportunity to lead the way. All this can be done within our current budget, by ending wasteful and damaging biofuel subsides. For the sake of our future prosperity we can and must achieve massive emission reductions. Forest and peatland conservation is one of the few methods at our disposal, where we can do this now and at low cost.</p>",
