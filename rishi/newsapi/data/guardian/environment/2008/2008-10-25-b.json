  "<p>A visit to Spain for property investors from the UK is a miserable experience these days. In airport arrival halls, the estate agents in beach shirts who used to target visitors have disappeared. Driving along the N-340 through the Costa del Sol, you pass sad terraces of new homes packed on to the hillsides. Many are completed but empty; most others are partly built but abandoned. Walking through tourist havens such as Fuengirola and Torremolinos, you spot estate agents' offices that are empty and grubby. Many have shut for good; optimistic ones have signs saying they will reopen next spring.</p> <p>Like everywhere else, this nation is suffering from the global credit crunch, but what is uniquely Spanish is the position of property at the eye of the storm. Spanish banks' exposure to housebuilding is higher than in the UK, ranging from 25 to 50 per cent of their balance sheets. Some 18 per cent of the country's gross domestic product is tied up in construction and associated industries. But the real shocker is the number of new homes - more than three million since 2004, half of them on the coast. Some 800,000 were started last year, despite the absence of any obvious demand.</p> <p>Those who bought after 2003 with a view to selling quickly have accepted price falls of up to 40 per cent, say local estate agents. Even developers such as Taylor Woodrow concede that people 'have had their fingers burnt'. The company has cut prices on three-quarters of its Spanish stock by as much as 25 per cent. However, most estate agents say anyone brave enough to buy a new home now should be able to negotiate further big reductions.</p> <p>As if the new-build oversupply was not enough, there are also homes on the market that have been repossessed and are being auctioned by banks. Two-bedroom flats with balconies typically cost \u00a377,000, according to www.propertyinspain.net. 'Many are just a few years old on developments with communal pools and grounds, secure parking and close to beaches,' says website spokesman Kevin Barnett. He says banks 'want only their loan and repossession legal costs back'.</p> <p>It is hardly surprising, then, that few sellers are able to shift their homes. They are reluctant to cut asking prices because they want to clear their mortgages, but without big reductions they cannot compete with cheap repossessed homes. </p> <p>Briton Richard Netherside put Calquico, the large restored farmhouse he lives in just north of Barcelona, on the market for \u20ac945,000 in August 2007. It is a handsome, three-storey property, with a large outdoor pool and extensive gardens. But his timing was bad - just as the Spanish market slumped, a few weeks before the Northern Rock crisis and as sterling slumped against the euro.</p> <p>He registered with 10 local estate agents, but only two bothered to visit. By May, no prospective purchaser had been to view it, so he cut the price to \u20ac830,000. It now stands at \u20ac749,000 (\u00a3585,000). </p> <p>'With the UK market falling away and the local buyers unable to get loans, we accept we are probably in for an extended wait yet,' says Mr Netherside, who has set up his own website, www.calquico.com, to try to attract buyers. </p> <p>Kevin Sheehan, a Surrey businessman, has been luckier, although he had to work hard to sell his five-bedroom holiday villa near Valencia. It was originally advertised in the summer of 2006 for \u20ac420,000, but after a year there had been 'nothing even remotely looking like an interested buyer'. </p> <p>In August 2007, he took matters into his own hands and spent the month contacting agents across the world in a bid to attract any interest. He sent 32,000 emails, registering the villa with agents and on free sale-by-owner websites. 'I had a large number of speculative offers of half the price, but I held my nerve. I reduced it to \u20ac320,000, but wouldn't drop further. In the end I sold it for fairly close to that figure,' he says.</p> <p>Experts suggest these are just two typical examples among tens of thousands. 'People have stretched themselves too much and developers have built one ugly scheme after another,' explains Mark Stucklin, a British property analyst who lives in Barcelona and runs a website for buyers, www.spanishpropertyinsight.com.</p> <p>'On the Costa del Sol, supply has exploded and most homes have been built on borrowed money. The developers have mortgages they'll never, ever repay. They owe far more than they'll get from buyers,' he says.</p> <p>On top of it all, the exchange rate has worked against sellers in Spain hoping to find British buyers. In October 2007 a \u20ac150,000 apartment would have cost about \u00a3104,000; now it is roughly \u00a3119,000 thanks to the strong euro.</p> <p>In the wider Spanish property market, sales are down 31.5 per cent against this time last year. The biggest slump has been in second-hand homes - sales volumes are down by a half.</p> <p>Many areas with new homes look like ghost towns. A planned new suburb of the inland Catalan town of Vic lies empty. It should by now have hundreds of new homes for Spanish professional owner-occupiers, but one developer has filed for bankruptcy and two others have mothballed their schemes indefinitely. As a result, acres of Vic's building sites are desolate and the show homes are closed. Only the guard dogs remain.</p> <p>Predictable? Yes, at least in hindsight. But that's no comfort to those whose dreams of a holiday home, as well as a pension, have shrivelled in the brutal sun of a Spanish property market that has gone bust.</p> <h2>Latest bargains</h2> <p>\u2022 Starting prices of flats at El Bosque de la Mairena, a Taylor Woodrow scheme in the hills a short drive from Marbella, have been slashed from \u00a3184,626 to \u00a3137,543. The scheme of 55 units has been on the market for 21 months 'at least', says the developer.

  "<p>The FTSE falls 5 per cent. The pound collapses against the dollar in the biggest one-day fall since floating exchange rates began in 1971; oil prices are in free fall; Asian markets in near panic. What happened on Friday was dumbfounding.</p> <p>Sure, there are problems in the real economy, but movements in the markets have been so violent that they are reinforcing the cycle of gloom and making moderately bad economic news seem like Armageddon. A decline of 0.5 per cent in British GDP in a quarter should not make an already depressed UK stock market fall a further 5 per cent.</p> <p>Systemically unstable, but highly interconnected, the global financial system is accelerating the effect of news that the world could enter a simultaneous recession into a potential cataclysmic disaster.</p> <p>G7 governments, genuflecting to the now disgraced titans of modern finance and the pet market theorists who supported them, have permitted, over the past 15 years, the creation of a shadow international financial system.</p> <p>This system consists of what are essentially gambling chips, such as credit derivatives, options, swaps, contracts for difference and stock lending for short selling. These are used by a vast global hedge fund industry to bet on movements of prices in the first financial system - shares, currencies, interest rates and commodity prices.</p> <p>But the tail now wags the dog. The size of the movements on Friday is only explicable in terms of hedge fund activity; funds in difficulty trying to clear their balance sheets and healthy funds making hay on the price movements, both exacerbating the situation.</p> <p>It's mayhem out there, so much so that financial speculation may turn recession into slump. The G7 governments must consider taking co-ordinated action about regulating the pricing and trading of all forms of derivatives. Hedge funds should be licensed only if they trade in assets in government licensed exchanges. The element of gambling should be taken out of the system.</p> <p>This will raise fundamental issues about the business models of many banks, which have become dependent on profits from the shadow financial system. This cannot continue.</p> <p>To get banks back on a normal footing, governments will have to support them with more than capital. They are going to have to insure and guarantee debt if credit is to flow again.</p> <p>All this is crucial for the UK. We have a very large financial sector compared to the size of our economy - a mega Iceland - and so are heavily exposed to both the destructive shadow second financial system and to banking's bust business model. We could find our entire real economy being shaped by these titanic and irrational moves in currencies and share prices. This crisis is moving into a dangerous new phase.</p>",
  "<p>The first guidebook of 'last chance saloon' holidays will be published tomorrow for travellers who want to visit the most endangered tourist destinations across the world. Frommer's 500 Places To See Before They Disappear provides a list of sites where it is still possible to see rare and vulnerable animal species, special landscapes and unique cultural sights in their unspoilt glory.</p> <p>Co-author Holly Hughes, a former executive editor of Fodor's Travel Publications, said: 'The devastation wrought by climate change and direct man-made interference is familiar to all of us. But this book is a carefully chosen list of last-chance destinations that eco-conscious travellers can enjoy - if they move sharpish - for possibly the last time.'</p> <p>According to Hughes and co-author Larry West, an award-winning investigative journalist once nominated for a Pulitzer prize, more than 20 of Britain's best-loved landmarks - and lesser-known gems - merit a place in their collection. The Tower of London and Greenwich Maritime Museum, for example, are at risk from rising ocean levels which will lead the Thames to flood its banks. </p> <p>With 500 threatened destinations to choose from, she suggests heading to the Everglades in southern Florida. Filled with rare species, this ecosystem is degenerating with alarming rapidity. Already half has been lost to agricultural and urban development. Dwindling water levels and pollution have severely compromised what remains. 'The number of bird species has fallen by 93 per cent and many of the fish and even the alligators who remain show high mercury levels,' said Hughes. </p> <p>The Dead Sea may only be a tourist option for three more decades. By then, says Hughes, 'it could be completely dry, thanks to the diverting of the rivers that feed it'. Marine life around the Falkland Islands is under severe threat from dumping by sanitation companies and ships. The Nazca lines in Peru, one of the world's most intriguing ancient sites, face destruction as roads are built and global warming and deforestation cause floods and mudslides. Also under threat is New York's Little Italy. 'Though a vestige of the area, celebrated in films from The Godfather to Mean Streets, has been preserved, it is being gradually squeezed by the burgeoning Chinatown and SoHo districts.'</p> <p>Those keen to stay closer to home, however, could visit some of Britain's ancient architectural treasures which, she says, risk falling into dereliction because of a lack of funding. Strawberry Hill, Sir Horace Walpole's folly in Twickenham, west London, which sparked the Gothic revival in the early 19th century, is struggling to raise \u00a38m. One of the oldest parish churches in England, St Mary's, in Stow in Lindsey, Lincolnshire, needs \u00a33m for renovations. Another London landmark, Battersea power station, becomes more derelict every day as government, developers and local community boards wrangle over its future. Hughes also urges a pilgrimage to Kentish Town, north London, to visit Little Green Street, one of the last intact Georgian streets in London. 'This perfect slice of Regency London was celebrated by the poet John Betjeman and used as the setting for numerous music and photo shoots. It survived the Blitz, but the inexorable march of gentrification is another thing altogether,' said Hughes. The Holderness coast, in East Yorkshire, loses nearly 6ft a year due to rising sea levels caused by climate change and man-made interference, she said.</p> <p>West points out that the guidebook's message is not all gloom. 'Some of the destinations are already on the road to being saved, usually because they've been championed by preservationists,' he said. 'And even in the cases where a site has been lost, or irrevocably damaged, it often has become a rallying point for activists, inspiring them to fight on so that the same mistakes aren't made again. The planet is poorer every time we allow something beautiful to die.'</p>",

The evenings kick off at 6.30pm and the museum closes at 10pm.</p> <p>\u2022 Cost: \u20ac12.50 adults, 2.50 under 17s, children free. 00 31 20 570 5200; <a href=\"http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl\">vangoghmuseum.nl</a></p> <p><strong>14. Rudas Baths, Budapest</strong></p> <p>The Rudas, one of Budapest's most spectacular thermal baths, has introduced late-night bathing until 4am from this month, so the drinks-dinner combo can be followed by a dip.

The Alhambra by night, Granada</strong></p> <p>It's one of Europe's most beautiful palaces, but the serenity of the Alhambra can be lost in the hordes of visitors by day. Visit by night, (Fridays and Saturdays from 8-9.30pm) and the crowds are considerably less - but it is only bookable as a private tour. The price of \u20ac190 for the one-and-a-half-hour tour remains the same whether for two people or 30, so it's worth trying to drum up a few friends to come along and share the cost. </p> <p>00 34 958 027950; <a href=\"http://www.alhambra.org\">alhambra.org</a></p> <h2>Stargazing</h2> <p><strong>16.

  "<p>Barclays is set to unveil a \u00a32bn-plus rescue package that will see the Qatar Investment Authority boost its investment in the British bank where it already owns an 8 per cent stake.</p> <p>A deal that could be announced in days will see the Qataris subscribe to \u00a31bn worth of new loan stock with another \u00a31bn being taken up by Barclays' existing institutional investors. </p> <p>The special new shares will be high-yielding securities that will pay a relatively high rate of interest. The funds will allow Barclays to say that it is on track to meet new government requirements that force banks to raise additional cash to meet tighter capital adequacy ratios in the wake of the credit crunch.</p> <p>One observer said: 'The great thing about the plan is that it will enable chief executive John Varley to underline his commitment to recapitalise the bank without seeking government help.'</p> <p>HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland are effectively being taken over by the state after being hobbled by the global financial crisis. But Varley has stated that Barclays has an independent future and will not draw down on funds that were part of a bail-out of Britain's struggling banks, announced by the Treasury this month.</p> <p>Barclays is expected to raise another \u00a33bn, possibly via a conventional rights issue, after it publishes annual figures in February. Analysts expect that the numbers will be strong enough to persuade investors to subscribe to new ordinary shares as part of a project to raise as much as \u00a310bn via capital raising, dividend cuts and cost savings. Last week, Barclays issued a \u00a32bn bond under the government's new debt-guarantee plan. In the summer, it raised \u00a34.5bn from overseas investors that included the QIA and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, while last year China Development Bank and Temasek of Singapore acquired small stakes.</p> <p>Separately, RBS is to announce this week that it is being hit for around \u00a35bn of further asset write-downs. At the same time, it will give a trading update and launch the prospectus for its \u00a320bn government-backed rescue.</p> <p>Analysts at KBW are forecasting hefty write-offs, on top of the \u00a35bn charge taken at the start of the year, which would push RBS's profits before tax down to just \u00a3582m, compared with almost \u00a39bn in 2007. The bank is expected to confirm that it is continuing negotiations over the sale of its Direct Line insurance business.</p> <p>Lloyds and HBOS are expected to launch the prospectuses for their share issues next month.</p>",
  "<p>Lights flicker and numbers flash up on small dials at the front of two computer servers nicknamed Meg Ryan and Jamie Lee Curtis by traders at the London headquarters of hedge fund giant Man Group.</p> <p>The shiny new technology is part of the nerve centre of AHL, one of Man's most successful hedge funds, which has notched up returns of 7 per cent in the past month alone, despite the financial turmoil. </p> <p>Others in the industry have been less fortunate. Analysts warn that global hedge funds are facing the biggest bloodbath since their rapid expansion in the early 1990s, especially in Britain, where about half of 2,000 firms are expected to be taken over by larger rivals or liquidated.</p> <p>But don't expect the funds to shout from the rooftops about their travails. They are notoriously secretive, preferring to work quietly in a sector conservatively estimated to account for around $2trn at the height of the boom.</p> <p>Unlike Man, most hedge funds are not public companies and many are registered offshore, so do not have to tell us very much about their operations. Suffice to say that they take huge bets on the future direction of interest rates, currencies, commodities, bonds and shares.</p> <p>But talk in the City is about how massive hedge fund redemptions are helping to push world stock markets to new depths as investors bail out in a desperate bid to turn their holdings into hard cash. One industry insider says: 'Some have already ceased to exist as nervous investors sell and highly leveraged funds face margin calls from banks, which want more collateral to take account of plummeting values.'</p> <p>As banks scream for cash, the funds sell more assets, setting up a vicious selling spiral that has added to the mayhem on stock markets.</p> <p>Sipping wine at a restaurant in the heart of Mayfair, where many hedge funds are based, a senior trader said: 'It's been another torrid week. Some of us aren't going to survive and that is going to be difficult for colleagues and friends with big mortgages and private school fees to pay. A lot are desperate.'</p> <p>While his comments won't elicit sympathy from many people outside his opaque financial world, property agents expect a glut of office space to come onto the market in central London as hedge funds vacate plush, well-appointed, air-conditioned premises.</p> <p>The prospect of meltdown in the industry was highlighted by Emmanuel Roman, the co-chief executive of hedge fund group GLG, who said that 25-30 per cent of the world's 8,000 hedge funds would disappear 'in a Darwinian process', either going bust or deciding meagre profits are not worth their efforts. His view was echoed by Professor Nouriel Roubini, a former US Treasury and presidential adviser, who estimated that up to 500 hedge funds would fail within months.</p> <p>While Man and other large, well-managed groups can weather the storm, smaller operators have borrowed heavily to finance risky investments, and these are the ones under mounting pressure from the banks. They employ few people but have been able to afford the huge rents charged in London's West End during the credit boom, during which they got used to a whopping 20 per cent performance fee on annual profits. That compares with 1 or 2 per cent charged by the conventional fund management industry, which directs investments for pension funds and insurance companies.</p> <p>The FSA ban on the short-selling of shares in many of Britain's major financial institutions has added to the woes of the hedge funds, many of which profited during the early stages of the market slump when share prices were still relatively high. Now, things are different. An analyst says: 'The industry has enjoyed the good times, but now that the wind has changed the weak will go to the wall, just as in every other area of British commercial life.'</p> <p>Though smaller funds are most vulnerable, some big names are also in trouble: in Britain, Martin Hughes's Tosca Fund has slumped around 30 per cent as investments in shares of financials and housebuilders have been hit. The fund is the largest overseen by Tosca Fund Asset Management, which Hughes started in 2000 after leaving Julian Robertson's Tiger Management.</p> <p>Another UK fund, Peloton Partners, founded by Ron Beller, was forced earlier this year to admit that its flagship $2bn fund, which invested in mortgage-backed securities, was worthless. It has since been wound up.</p> <p>In the US, Citadel has lost more than 26 per cent this year, a stunning reverse for a Chicago firm whose Midas touch and aggressive recruiting of traders has evoked envy on Wall Street.</p> <p>Hedge funds delivered their worst performance on record in September: globally, their value declined 5 per cent against the previous month. All this from an industry which has boasted that it can buck the market, no matter what the trading climate. How hollow that claim rings today.</p>",
  "<p>Companies seeking to offload expensive final salary pension schemes may be the latest victims of the credit crunch. Activity in the burgeoning pensions buyout market has all but dried up since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and experts have doubts over whether it will revive when stock and bond markets start to recover.</p> <p>Richard Jones, principal at pension advisers Punter Southall, warned months ago it was unlikely that buyouts by insurance companies would top \u00a38bn this year, far below the \u00a312bn-\u00a315bn most other commentators predicted. With the current total stuck at \u00a36.3bn so far, his view could actually prove over-optimistic.</p> <p>Others are now falling into line with that forecast. Paul Belok, principal and actuary at Aon Consulting, says: 'There is a major risk that the momentum that has been built up in the buyout market in recent quarters is in serious danger of being lost.' He expects 'a slowdown in the spectacular growth we have witnessed in the last year, although in the longer term we expect the market to remain buoyant'.</p> <p>He points out that company pension funds are worth more than \u00a31 trillion, meaning buyouts so far represent only a tiny proportion of the total. 'Even if just 25 per cent of the market goes into the insurance sector in the next few years, it will represent a huge business.'</p> <p>Again, however, Jones is unsure: he thinks it is highly unlikely that the rapid growth in the market predicted by much of the industry will materialise.</p> <p>He believes that the increase in deals was in effect being driven by bargain-basement pricing that is no longer tenable. Companies such as Paternoster, set up by Mark Wood three years ago to take advantage of what was expected to be a fast-growing buyout market, were offering discounts of as much as 10 per cent to pension fund trustees to persuade them to transfer the schemes. Wood was taking the lion's share of business - in 2007, Paternoster accounted for almost half the \u00a32.9bn of buyout deals done, and it has completed a further \u00a31.1bn worth in the first nine months of this year.</p> <p>But the financial crisis, which has rocked share and bond markets, means such discount pricing is no longer feasible. Aon says that insurers have become 'more nervous' and have 'ceased providing guarantees on the assumptions underlying their quotations'. </p> <p>It adds: 'A number have started pricing more conservatively than previously, and a higher charge is being imposed for paying in cash or other assets that the insurer does not want to hold. The impact has been that a number of deals that were close to transacting have seen the goalposts move over the past few weeks, with some insurers unwilling or unable to transact in the short term.'</p> <p>One of the key issues undermining the buyout market is the same as that affecting the share prices of quoted insurance companies such as Aviva and Prudential, which have plunged more than 40 per cent in the past month: the availability of capital. </p> <p>When a pension fund is bought out by an insurance company, the trustees buy an annuity from the insurer which guarantees the payment of the contracted level of pensions to all its members. The company, in turn, invests the assets of the fund in bonds aimed at providing a high enough return to cover that guarantee.</p> <p>While bonds have traditionally been more secure investments than equities, the financial crisis and risk of a severe global recession have sent their prices plunging. Some sections of the bond market are down by more than 40 per cent over the past month or so as investors fret that defaults are going to rise sharply. All of Paternoster's assets - and a large proportion of those at Aviva and the Pru - are in these bonds, and investors have started to wonder whether the plunge in their prices means they will need to raise new capital.</p> <p>Both Aviva and Prudential have ruled out a rights issue and Paternoster's Wood is sanguine. He says that Paternoster will hold its bonds until they mature and that most have very long durations and high credit ratings - more than 80 per cent are rated A or above. Defaults on the portfolio have been running at less than 0.2 per cent. But the financial crisis has meant ratings are no longer that good a guide to default risk; Lehman's bonds were rated as AAA, yet most will see only a very small return. </p> <p>Wood also insists Paternoster has plenty of capital: the \u00a3500m raised when it launched was enough to fund about \u00a36.5bn of deals and it has so far completed only around \u00a33bn worth. </p> <p>But one consultant believes that the discounts on some of the earlier deals means Paternoster will have had to have set aside more of its capital to support those buyouts, while it has also taken longer than anticipated to get the buyout market up and running, which means Paternoster has had to devote more time to its launch phase.</p> <p>Edmund Truell of Pension Corporation, a new potential buyer in the market, says there has been a significant withdrawal of capital in the past four months, with banks such as Citigroup and Lehman pulling out. 'Pressure on other insurers is significant because of their holdings of equities,' he adds.</p> <p>He does not expect much of that capital to return. Legal &amp; General and Prudential, which traditionally shared the pensions buyout market, are likely to remain active, along with 'one or two' players operating at the edge. Pension Corporation raised \u00a31bn at launch and, says Truell, that makes it one of the best capitalised companies.</p> <p>Aon says trustees are also becoming more cautious following the collapse of AIG, one of the world's largest insurers: 'Questions regarding the covenant provided by insurers are very much to the fore in light of the failures seen in the financial sector, albeit that the regulatory protection in place for life insurers provides significant comfort.'</p> <p>For pensioners, an insolvent insurance company could be a better bet than a pension fund run by a bankrupt corporation. While the FSA guarantees payment of insurers' benefits, corporate pension schemes are dealt with by the Pension Protection Fund - and that only covers 90 per cent of the promised payout, up to just less under \u00a327,000.</p>",
  "<p>Devaluation used to be a dirty word in British politics: sterling's status as the world's reserve currency was a symbol of the country's economic might, and Chancellors who oversaw sudden downward lurches in its value on the foreign exchanges faced humiliation. Even in 1992, when pretensions to empire were long gone, the pound's plunge out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism was regarded as the worst failure of financial management for a generation.</p> <p>In the depths of this 21st-century economic crisis, Britain's status in the world economy is once again being questioned - and sterling has come under sustained attack. It plunged from $1.75 against the dollar on Monday, to little more than $1.58 by the end of the week. By mid-afternoon on Friday, it had fallen farther than even on Black Wednesday.</p> <p>Alistair Darling, unlike his hapless predecessors, can leave it to the foreign exchange markets to set the value of the pound; but the message from the world's investors last week was no less loud and clear than in 1992, or 1967: confidence in Britain's economy has been brutally shattered. Confirmation that a recession is almost certainly upon us, with a 0.5 per cent decline in GDP in the third quarter of the year, just added fresh urgency to a sell-off that was already well under way.</p> <p>The strength of the pound over the past decade, despite a vast and growing trade gap, made exports expensive, and tightened the squeeze on manufacturing that had begun in the 1980s. Confidence in the City as an economic powerhouse helped to sustain the demand for sterling, detracting from problems elsewhere in the economy.</p> <p>It was a hard-hitting speech from King on Tuesday, in which he used the word 'recession' for the first time, that unleashed the latest decline. The governor pointed out that Britain's banks - and the economy as a whole - have been heavily dependent on loans from overseas investors, and 'those external inflows have fallen sharply - a mild form of the reversal of capital inflows experienced by a number of emerging market economies in the 1990s'. In other words, Britain is facing a diluted version of the brutal punishment meted out by the markets to Thailand, Malaysia and other vulnerable countries during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998.</p> <p>Then, almost overnight, investors radically reassessed the prospects for these 'tiger' economies. For years, they had been the stars of the international markets; suddenly, as it became clear that many of the cheap loans that had poured into Asian businesses could probably never be paid back, they were written off as basket cases. Billions of dollars of 'hot money' flooded out, forcing them to devalue their currencies. The cost of servicing their foreign debts rocketed, and many were driven ignominiously into the arms of the International Monetary Fund - the same fate now facing Hungary, Pakistan and others.</p> <p>Over the past decade, the UK, like the tigers in their day, has been attracting billions of dollars of foreign investment, allowing its banks to lend far more than they were taking in deposits from savers, and households to run up unprecedented debts. King's reminder of the fate of fragile emerging economies a decade ago was a stark warning that, unless the flows of capital into Britain are now replaced with new sources of financing, the adjustment now facing the economy will be even more jarring than analysts previously thought.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the mass exodus from the pound after he spoke suggested that if anything, the outflow of capital is likely to accelerate. So irredeemably gloomy is the news from the economy, that one City analyst, Howard Archer of Global Insight, even said sorry last week for the repetitiveness of his research notes: 'I apologise for this analysis being virtually identical to other recent reaction pieces but there are only so many ways you can say that the housing market is up the creek and sadly lacking on the paddle front,' he said.</p> <p>Comparing Britain's fate with the spectacular Asian collapse may seem far-fetched, but Professor Nick Crafts of the London School of Economics says the parallel is apt, at least in one sense: the boom of the past decade concealed extraordinary failings of regulation, and weaknesses in the financial health of businesses and households. 'Falling property prices weaken balance sheets, and something that looked very good suddenly crumbles,' he says.</p> <p>For the past decade, many analysts have argued that the pound was unusually high against the dollar and euro; now, with the vulnerabilities of the banking system and the consumer sector painfully obvious, an adjustment seems to be taking place. Crafts says that, like the record of the Asian economies in the early 1990s, the record of the past 10 years in Britain will look rather different in hindsight. 'It wasn't a mirage, it was a good economic performance - but there were some warning signs. I think we'll come to see it as less secure than it seemed at the time.'</p> <p>Among the first to feel the pound's new-found feebleness will be holidaymakers. Britain's consumers have made lavish use of their strong overseas spending power for the past decade, aided by the rise of cut-price air travel and the property boom that has given them windfall profits to spend on second homes in Tuscany or Spain.</p> <p>Christmas shopping in New York, once the preserve of the super-rich, became attainable for many in the middle classes with money to burn, as the pound shot up to $2; and an annual holiday abroad moved from being a luxury to a must-have for ordinary families. According to government figures, holidaying Brits spent \u00a319.5bn overseas in 1998; by 2007, that had shot up to \u00a335bn.</p> <p>Holiday spending was already destined for a squeeze, as indebted households struggle to come to terms with the rising cost of credit - and the decline in the value of property, which for many is their main asset. But the decline in sterling will make travellers acutely conscious of Britain's fading fortunes.</p> <p>Yet notwithstanding the blow to national pride, many economists believe a cheaper pound may eventually help to lift the economy out of recession, making exports cheaper, and redressing some of the economy's imbalances.</p> <p>King's apparently relaxed view - many analysts saw his Tuesday-night intervention as nothing less than a deliberate effort to 'talk down the pound' - contrasts with the stubborn masochism of former inhabitants of Threadneedle Street and the Treasury.</p> <p>When Winston Churchill was Chancellor, in 1925, there was a furious row about whether Britain should return to the Gold Standard at the high exchange rate that had prevailed before the First World War. Received wisdom, including that of Montagu Norman, the mercurial Bank of England governor, was that Britain must confirm its international prowess by rejoining. Churchill flirted with the alternative view, espoused by John Maynard Keynes, that such a return would be disastrous, and held a celebrated dinner party, with Keynes among the guests, to debate the issue into the night over champagne and brandy.</p> <p>Eventually, the pro-Gold Standard camp won Churchill over, but the decision turned out to be a terrible miscalculation, crippling already struggling export industries, including shipbuilding, coal and textiles and contributing to the massive industrial unrest that culminated in the General Strike a year later.</p> <p>Keynes responded by dashing off a polemical pamphlet called The Economic Consequences of Mr Churchill, echoing the title of his more famous essay on the punitive reparations imposed on Germany after the First World War.</p> <p>A misguided determination to cling to the strength of sterling continued to be a motif of British economic management in the 20th century.</p> <p>Professor Catherine Schenk of Glasgow University, who specialises in the postwar period, says that during past devaluations the public often made the mistake of assuming that a weak currency was a mark of failure. 'People were worried about the impact on their cost of living,' she says. 'The embarrassment looms large in the public's imagination, but you have to remember that a strong pound hurts exporters.'</p> <p>Policymakers watching the pound declining so rapidly would usually be deeply concerned about inflation taking off, as the price of imports in sterling terms shoots up; but as the economy slows sharply, soaring unemployment is expected to keep a lid on wage rises, and retailers are unlikely to be able to pass on cost increases to hard-pressed consumers.</p> <p>Just as the return to the Gold Standard was not a mark of Britain's prowess but an unbearable economic burden, the rare strength of sterling over the past decade, as consumer debts piled up and the trade deficit ballooned, may one day be seen as a symptom of an economy running out of control. </p> <p>And the decline in the pound, galling though it is for shoppers hoping to snap up Christmas bargains in Macy's or Bloomingdale's, may eventually provide the impetus the economy needs for what King has called 'the long march back to boredom and stability'.</p> <h2>Devaluation crises</h2> <p><strong>1931: All that glisters ...</strong><br>Six devastating years after returning to the Gold Standard, which tied sterling to the value of gold reserves at the costly prewar exchange rate, Philip Snowden, Chancellor in the emergency national government, suspends convertibility. But not before much of British industry is devastated by the expensive pound, and Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of England, has a nervous breakdown.</p> <p>Sterling almost immediately falls by 20 per cent against the dollar, helping to spark an economic recovery. Sidney Webb, Colonial Secretary in Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government, which was torn apart by the financial crisis that resulted from trying to cling to the Gold Standard, later exclaimed, 'nobody told us we could do that'.</p> <p><strong>1949: Postwar blues</strong><br>The Austerity Chancellor, Stafford Cripps, bows to the inevitable and announces a devaluation from $4.03 to $2.80, in the hope of reviving Britain's bombed-out postwar economy. The price of a loaf of bread, made with imported American wheat, rises from 4d to 6d.</p> <p><strong>1967: Wilson's woes</strong><br>After the Bank of England spends \u00a3200m in gold and foreign currency reserves trying to maintain the value of the pound in the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates, Harold Wilson announces a devaluation from $2.80 to $2.40. He fruitlessly tries to reassure voters that 'it does not mean that the pound here in Britain, in your pocket or purse or in your bank, has been devalued'.</p> <p><strong>1992: Tumbling out of the ERM</strong><br>Norman Lamont is forced to stumble on to the steps of the Treasury to say Britain is suspending its membership of the European exchange rate mechanism, after announcing two interest rate rises in a single day to try to support sterling against the Deutschmark.</p> <h2>From bad to worse: developing nations on brink of collapse</h2> <p>Britain faces the grim reality of its first serious recession in 17 years, but less developed countries are in a worse state, with several on the verge of collapse and seeking emergency funds from Western financial institutions.</p> <p>Top of the critical list is nuclear-armed Pakistan. With more than 172 million people, it is by far the biggest and most significant country outside the US and EU to seek a bail-out from the International Monetary Fund, joining Turkey, Ukraine, Hungary and Belarus. Pakistan is a key American ally and if it defaulted on its international loans, it would have serious consequences for the new pro-US government of President Asif Ali Zardari.</p> <p>Analysts fear that as economic conditions worsen, millions more will be pushed into abject poverty, which could help Islamic extremists to recruit new converts. Pakistan's border region with Afghanistan already resembles a war zone, with 120,000 troops engaged in a crackdown against militants who support the Taliban and al-Qaeda. </p> <p>The country's financial meltdown has seen Pakistan's foreign reserves dwindle by $1bn a month as the authorities have tried, unsuccessfully, to prop up the plummeting currency, as well as subsidise food in the face of roaring inflation that has hit 25 per cent. Foreign banks and lenders have withdrawn credit and overseas investors have fled.</p> <p>A continuing decline in the value of the rupee could effect the ability of Pakistan to import basic foodstuffs and goods and force the government to cut back further on spending, increasing the number of jobless. There is a huge current account deficit, further eroding confidence.</p> <p>When emerging nations run into trouble, it reduces their ability to import foreign goods from countries such as Britain, and hits a global economy hammered by the credit crunch. According to the credit default swap market in London, there is a 90 per cent chance of Pakistan defaulting on foreign loans due for repayment in the next three months to two years.</p> <p>Last week, Shaukat Tarin, the country's economic adviser, admitted that Pakistan was in talks about aid from the IMF, but was also looking for help from China, a long-time strategic ally.</p> <p>Developing countries face severe difficulties as the world credit crisis takes it toll on nations unable to launch bail-outs on anything like the scale of America and Europe. Police have been called to the Karachi stock exchange, which has been besieged by angry investors who have seen their shareholdings wiped out.</p> <p>Pakistan's banks have overextended themselves and many have withdrawn credit from heavily-indebted consumers and businesses. The government is said to need at least $4bn in the next few weeks.</p> <p>Analysts warn of dire consequences unless the international community rallies around Pakistan, whose support is seen as critical to the Nato mission in Afghanistan. Rating agencies said a Pakistani request for help from the IMF was a positive step that could put the country on a firmer footing, but much would depend on how soon the government could implement the reforms that would be a condition of any bail-out.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Hungary hiked interest rates from 8.5 to 11.5 per cent last week to protect its currency and prevent a further increase in the size of its foreign currency debts. However, analysts warn that the move will accelerate the decline in economic growth.<br><strong>Richard Wachman</strong></p>",
  "<p>It's not just in finance that the inquests have begun. What part have the business schools and business academics played in the implosion of the world's banking system? That was the question posed in a letter to the Financial Times last week by Nottingham University Business School's Professor Ken Starkey.</p> <p>Hedge funds, private equity, investment banking, venture capital and consulting - the high priesthood of financial capitalism - were overwhelmingly MBAs' preferred job destinations, he noted. Now the schools needed to 'reflect on the role of the MBA and MBAs in the carnage of Wall Street' and consider 'how management education has contributed to the mindset that has led to the excesses of the last two decades'.</p> <p>This isn't the first time that theory and theorists have been called into question. Three years ago the London Business School's late Sumantra Ghoshal caused a furore by writing that business schools did not need to do a lot more to prevent the emergence of future Enrons; they just needed to stop doing a good deal of what they were doing already.</p> <p>But the questioning takes on a fresh urgency as the crises grow bigger. In this context, the issue is not just the implication of economics-dominated MBA courses in practices that are now seen to be unsustainable. 'There seems to be no sense of history,' Starkey complains. 'How come we haven't learnt anything from Enron, the dotcoms and Long Term Capital Management?'</p> <p>Trapped until now in a stampede to emulate the American model, business schools elsewhere need to step back and see how they could, and should, frame the issues differently, he says. The Holy Grail is not to turn them into professional institutes (as two Harvard professors proposed in another FT article the same day) but the more modest one of 'doing better social science'. They should move away from unquestioned US positivism and the dominance of neo-classical economics towards a broader perspective allowing insights from other areas, including history, literature and art.</p> <p>Could it happen? Starkey is not the only one who senses an opportunity for the market to move in a new direction. The 'elite' business schools are doomed to remain locked in increasing competition for a (presumably) shrinking pool of apprentice masters of the universe. But for others, says Professor James Fleck, dean of the Open University Business School, Europe's largest, the time is ripe to go beyond the fake certainties of the Anglo-American version, with its emphasis on analytics and separate functions, to develop a more inclusive, less lopsidedly right-brain approach to management.</p> <p>Most of the world is not well served by the structures or assumptions of financial capitalism. If we could lift our eyes from the financial chaos, Fleck argues, we would see that the world is at the start of a huge technological upswing. As a consequence, there is terrific, unsatisfied demand for people to manage this innovation in ways that benefit more than a tiny financial elite. Management, in the sense of 'making a difference', could be the enabling technology of the 21st century. Who better placed to undertake such a project, and rethink the intellectual underpinnings of capitalism, than European business schools?</p> <p>Many would welcome such a move. At Leicester School of Management, Professor Martin Parker notes that, though long submerged under the 'there is no alternative' discourse, an undercurrent of resistance to the market managerialism of the past 30 years has always subsisted - and not just in the public sector (where, duly adapted, it has ironically been practised with terrifying thoroughness). The surprising rage and venom hissing through the blogs commenting on a recent Economist leader about bankers' pay show just how deep it runs in the private sector too.</p> <p>Little of this surfaces in formal management research, however. Analysing 2,300 articles published in prominent journals in 2003 and 2004, Parker and two colleagues found business-school researchers overwhelmingly concentrating on narrow technical questions rather than the larger social and political issues - the environment, war, workers' rights, the distribution of wealth - which business has signally failed to provide answers to. While the piece, ('Speaking Out: The Responsibilities of Management Intellectuals'), pre-dated the financial crash, in one sense it reinforces it - underlining that in terms of what academics actually publish, little seems to have changed since Enron, or even the dotcoms.</p> <p>The underlying question, says Parker, is whether business schools can contribute to the solution rather than the problem. One way of doing this, he suggests, would be to reformat themselves as 'Schools for Organising' that can teach and learn from a multiplicity of different forms - 'and do not simply reproduce the ideology of people called managers'.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk\">simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>There was a time, not so long ago, when vainglorious politicians and neurotic bureaucrats saw to it that grand projects in Britain routinely failed. Think of the Millennium Dome and the national joke that was the Football Association's rebuilding of Wembley.</p> <p>So the idea that London should even consider staging the 2012 Olympics seemed mad. But what sold it to me was a once-in-a-generation opportunity to inject serious investment into the East End of London, where I live. True, billions of pounds of taxpayers' cash created the spectacular yet soulless Canary Wharf office development in the Eighties and Nineties. But 'Wall Street on the water' has always been a self-contained bankers' ghetto. The deprived London boroughs of Newham, Tower Hamlets and Hackney muddled on regardless.</p> <p>The East End Games promised a substantial legacy: affordable homes, an Olympic-sized swimming complex, a national basketball centre, tempting campuses for creative industries, improved transport and jobs, even a BMX track. Living just off the Murder Mile in Hackney (so named for good - or should that be bad? - reasons), this was the stuff that appealed to me. </p> <p>Just bidding for the Games achieved previously unattainable results. So awful was transport in the East End, an early International Olympic Committee bid inspection concluded, that Labour had no choice but to fund a new \u00a31bn train line linking Hackney, one of the few London boroughs without a tube station, to the rest of the network, after years of vacillation.</p> <p>The Olympic Park site, for decades a contaminated urban wasteland where overhead electricity pylons killed any prospect of regeneration, would see the cables buried and the centre of gravity shift east in 21st-century London. But it was more than this. My grandad, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany, took his son, my late dad, to the 1948 Games in London. I liked the idea that the Games could act as a glue 64 years later in the most ethnically diverse part of the most international city in the world.</p> <p>If the cost escalated, so be it. How often does an opportunity to lay down structures to build what eventually will be 30,000 new homes in a neglected part of the capital come around? But here we are in the midst of a global financial crisis and I'm scared the East End Olympics are fast turning into the 'Whatever Games'.</p> <p>Think about it. The \u00a39.3bn Olympic budget is nothing in the context of a \u00a3500bn bail-out of British banks. But because banks aren't prepared to lend cash to build the Games, the government has to step in. As a result, everything is being downsized, including the Olympic dream. In the last month, the London 2012 plans have shrunk alarmingly. Originally, the Olympic Village was to have bequeathed 4,200 much-needed homes to rent or buy immediately after the Games. Six months ago, that was revised down to 3,300. Last week it went down to just 2,700.</p> <p>Central to the original bid was the Aquatic Centre, which was to become a community facility complete with leisure attractions - slides and wave machine - which was bound to attract the young and boost their sense of well-being. That has now been scrapped. What we are left with is a pool that has quadrupled in cost to \u00a3303m. </p> <p>The broadcast centre was meant to be a 1.2million sq ft media hub once the 20,000 journalists covering the Games left. After temporary buildings are removed in September 2012, what will be left is a building a fifth of its original size.</p> <p>Those in the know say there has been a failure by the Olympic authorities and developers fully to identify future tenants for the centre, despite interest from globally renowned news media firms looking for cheap office space.</p> <p>Maybe it's the little things that best illustrate how we are in danger of heading towards the 'Whatever Games'. Earlier this year, my daughter's year four class was one of 12 from primary schools in the Olympic boroughs given digital cameras to document 'My World'. </p> <p>The kids were told images would be beamed on screens in the Mall during August's handover party. Those who set up the project agree the resulting snaps offer a powerful, innocent insight into the East End from a rare perspective. Yet six months later, those pictures have never seen the light of day.</p> <p>There is a strong sense that the organisers are too nervous to let the world see the real East End. But denying those youngsters their chance to shine and the sense we are compromising the legacy of 2012 means one thing: those who live on the Games' doorstep will lose interest in a transient jamboree. And the enthusiasm the East End Games would inspire was the real reason we wanted them in the first place.</p>",
  "<p>Voting for a Republican president runs in the blood of places like Gainesville. The pretty little town of 15,000 sits in north Texas ranch country and it is safe to say that Barack Obama has few fans here. Certainly Jim Farquhar, who works in the justice system, has taken to heart warnings that Obama has links with dangerous radicals, such as former 1960s militant Bill Ayers. </p> <p>'Obama scares me. He has all these friendships. You just don't know how that might effect him once he gets into office,' Farquhar said as he stood outside Gainsville's sturdy old courthouse. 'I'm voting for John McCain.'</p> <p>Such worries are increasingly not shared by many other Americans. Weeks of relentless attacks on Obama by McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin have not succeeded in denting Obama's lead. Instead it has strengthened. Across America, battleground states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania are falling into Obama's column and southern states such as Virginia and North Carolina are going from red to blue. Some Democratic insiders are even whispering about the prospect of a landslide.</p> <p>The flipside of that is a potentially devastating Republican loss. If current polling holds true, the party may be reduced to its core support in the solid red heartland that runs through Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia and other southern and western states. That would trigger a profound crisis for a party that just three years ago was basking in the afterglow of a convincing presidential win and dreaming of creating a 'permanent majority'. </p> <p>Now that same Republican party could face a prolonged period in the political wilderness, working out how to appeal to an American public that seems prepared to send a pro-choice, black senator from Chicago to the White House and reject a conservative Republican war hero. </p> <p>'The Republican party is going to have to work out what sort of party it actually wants to be. It's a changing world for them,' said Professor Shaun Bowler, a political scientist at the University of California at Riverside. It might not be easy. A powerful Democratic win could wipe out Republican moderates. It could leave the party in the grip of its conservative and evangelical base who remain critical of figures such as McCain but who are wildly enthusiastic about politicians such as Palin. The Republican party could end up in a bitter civil war for its political future.'</p> <p>One of the key battlegrounds in that conflict will be the role of religion in Republican politics. The evangelical base has been a key part of the political coalition that has brought the party such success in recent years. Political guru Karl Rove cemented evangelical ideas into President George W Bush's brand of conservatism and used them to inspire a very effective 'get out the vote' team in elections.</p> <p>Rove focused on social issues such as gay marriage and abortion as a way of ensuring fanatical evangelical support. Nothing came to symbolise the power of the evangelical movement more than the rise of mega-churches, especially in staunchly Republican areas. These enormous edifices now dot the landscape of many states and Texas is no exception.</p> <p>In the northern Dallas suburb of Prosper, a new mega-church has just opened. It is called Prestonwood North and is a branch of its mother church a few miles south in Plano, a fast-growing city of some 260,000 people. At first glance the church looks like a sparkling new office development, identical to many other buildings popping up on farmland as these 'exurbs' of Dallas succumb to development. But the large cross on its front reveals the truth. Taken as a whole, Prestonwood now has almost 30,000 members, making it one of the largest churches in America. It was recently named as one of America's 50 most influential churches.</p> <p>It certainly fits in in Prosper. Once a hamlet, it is gradually being swallowed by the suburbs, but its politics remain God and guns. 'People around here all voted for Bush. That has not really changed. It's a churchgoing kind of place,' said Michelle Williams, 32, a dental nurse.</p> <p>In Texas, church and politics have been mixing. In recent weeks, leading evangelical leaders in the state have endorsed McCain from their pulpits. They include Pastor Gary Simons, who heads a church near Dallas. He compared Obama to King Herod, the biblical child killer, because of his support for abortion. 'How many of you would want to go to the polls and vote for Herod?' Simons asked his congregation. </p> <p>But increasingly such nakedly political preaching is looking out of step with many religious voters. Obama, who is a regular churchgoer and looks at ease in religious surroundings, has made huge strides in appealing to evangelical voters. His campaign has aggressively courted the religious vote, holding regular meetings with evangelical leaders.</p> <p>That is in marked contrast to the 2004 Democratic nominee, John Kerry. It has worked too. A recent survey showed Obama and McCain in a virtual dead heat among born-again Christians, with support for McCain running at 45 per cent and Obama on 43 per cent. In 2004, Bush won 62 per cent of that vote. 'If Obama goes on to win, one of the significant stories will be the profile of the faith vote ... the Democrats are poised to make up significant ground among born again and evangelical voters,' said David Kinnaman, president of the evangelical research group that carried out the poll.</p> <p>The trend is also likely to reflect growing differences in the evangelical movement itself; changes that are leaving the Republican party behind. Far from being a monolithic bloc, evangelicals have increasingly embraced a wider variety of causes. Some are just as likely to campaign on fighting Aids and issues in the developing world as to crusade against abortion and gay marriage. One of the hottest topics in conservative Christianity at the moment is environmental conservation and global warming, neither of which is a Republican strong suit.</p> <p>Yet, following a possible November defeat, the Republican party itself could still remain firmly in the hands of its conservative evangelical wing. Even as America drifts away from causes that right-wing evangelicals care about, the Republican base remains fixated on them. After all, McCain was forced to court the evangelical vote in order to secure the nomination himself. </p> <p>To cement his position, he ended up choosing Palin - a true religious conservative - as his running mate. That move electrified die-hard Republicans but turned off other voters for whom the collapsing economy - not fighting the teaching of evolution in schools or banning abortion - has become the overriding concern. It allowed Obama to seize the vital middle ground. </p> <p>'In the Republican party itself it seems that the Christian right is going to be in the ascendancy. But that is looking like a losing political strategy for the future,' said Bowler.</p> <p>There is increasingly a sense that what works for the Republican base no longer works for the rest of the country, even in the heart of red state America. Take Kingfisher, Oklahoma. The town sits in the middle of a county that is one of the reddest in America when it comes to presidential politics. It voted for Bush over Kerry in 2004 by a staggering 85 per cent to 15 per cent. Even now the state of Oklahoma remains spectacularly loyal to the Republicans. The most recent poll showed McCain 24 points ahead of Obama. A previous one gave him a lead of more than 30 per cent.</p> <p>But even in Kingfisher the signs of Republican disarray are not hard to find. Businesswoman Charlene Franks is put off by the campaign that McCain and Palin are running. 'I am voting for McCain but I don't really like it. It's the economy that matters right now and groceries are getting expensive. We really don't eat that much any more,' she said. Her views on Palin were not complimentary either. 'She is not ready to be president,' Franks said.</p> <p>Ready or not, Palin is still likely to be one of the most dominant forces in Republican politics after the election. Unlike McCain, she draws thousands to her rallies. She has developed a genuinely enthusiastic following among activists who are dedicated to her cause. Already there is speculation that Palin, if McCain loses in November, will be the hottest pick for the nomination in 2012. </p> <p>That will be made easier by a large-scale electoral defeat. In a process reminiscent of the Labour party in the 1980s and the Conservatives in the late 1990s, the Republicans could end up as an extremist rump, reduced to a few stronghold states and obsessed with causes that seem not to matter to the general public. </p> <p>Across America, moderate Republicans are facing a tough battle as the Democrats look set to increase greatly their strength in Congress. Some analysts are seeing Democratic gains of up to nine Senate seats and 30 seats in the House of Representatives. In a leaked Republican party document last week, an incredible 58 House seats were ranked as potentially at risk with 11 of them virtually written off as already lost. </p> <p>If the Democrats perform strongly enough to control 60 Senate seats then they would have a virtual free rein over the political landscape. Republicans would probably survive only in their heartland, thus thrusting the party further right at a time when the country has shifted left. That would mark a profound change similar to Ronald Reagan's win in 1980 which seemed to usher in a conservative-dominated era. </p> <p>The possibility has many Republican pundits terrified. 'The end of the Reagan era?' blared one headline in the political magazine National Journal. The Wall Street Journal added fuel to the fire with an editorial that went ever further. 'Get ready for change we haven't seen since 1965 or 1933,' it warned under the headline: 'A liberal supermajority'.</p> <p>Such a prospect angers conservative Republicans. But much of that anger is directed at the current occupant of the White House. For eight years Bush preached conservatism from the Oval Office. He spoke of a desire for small government, limited spending and an emphasis on social issues such as fighting abortion. Instead the size of government has increased - mostly due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security - and spending has rocketed because of Iraq and Afghanistan. </p> <p>On social issues, Bush has delivered a more conservative Supreme Court but abortion remains legal. In a final blow to conservative ideals, the economic crisis has seen Bush's administration preside over the semi-nationalisation of swaths of the financial services industry.</p> <p>No wonder there is anger on the streets of places like Gainesville. After all, the Texas town backed Bush in 2004 with 79 per cent of the vote. Now its people feel they did not get what they voted for. 'There's been no leadership. I liked Bush as a man. He was not very polished, but that was part of his appeal. But things have not turned out well,' said Bill Wilkinson, a writer, as he walked past a cafe on Gainesville's town square. </p> <p>Of course, it is still premature to declare an Obama victory. 'Anything can happen. But the election is clearly Obama's to lose,' said Kinnaman.</p> <p>McCain has built a long political career on unlikely comebacks. He might yet pull off the biggest surprise of his life. But for the moment the signs are grim across the Republican heartland. </p> <p>From Kingfisher, Oklahoma, to Gainesville, Texas, and far beyond the mood is sour. 'I guess it looks like Obama is going to make it,' said Farquhar. 'But no one is happy about it. It is going to be beyond just having another tax-and-spend liberal in office.' </p> <p>That will be for the future to decide. But for the moment it looks as if Obama and the Democrats are preparing for the highest office in America, to add to their control of both House and Senate. The Republicans, meanwhile, are bracing for what could be a painful period of exile.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday October 29 2008. We referred to Barack Obama as the 'pro-life black senator from Chicago'. Obama supports a women's right to choose; we meant 'pro-choice'. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>'Madam, do you know what your house weighs?' This was asked by Buckminster Fuller, the contrarian technocrat polemicist whose 1928 Dymaxion House was the purest expression of architecture as technology. Of course, all guy wires and exposed metal, it did not catch on. Fuller built one for himself on the campus at Carbondale in South Illinois where he taught, but there were few other takers. Yet Fuller's ideas were hugely influential on the Foster-Rogers generation of architects who saw some form of redemption in an absolute commitment to explicit technology instead of traditional building craft.</p> <p>Thus, the highly serviced, self-supporting 'pod' became a recurrent theme for strict observance modernists. The great architectural writer Reyner Banham (with illustrator Fran\u00e7ois Dallegret) proposed an Environment Bubble in 1965. Banham said there was so much that was mechanical and electrical going on in a modern building, what with cabling, trunking, air-conditioning, sound systems and heating, that a house could stand up by itself. 'What's the house doing except concealing your mechanical pudenda?' he demanded of bricks and mortar. And in a symbolic personal revelation, he was illustrated sitting naked in a clear plastic pod kept rigid by the positive pressure of the air-con.</p> <p>Banham's letting it all hang out was a mantra of the Sixties that became an architectural idea in the Centre Pompidou of the Seventies, but personal pods-for-living-in have never been properly realised, although they have often pre-occupied architects.</p> <p>Jan Kaplick... of Future Systems (who worked with Richard Rogers in Paris) published his House for a Helicopter Pilot in 1979. With its helipad on the roof and its articulated feet on the ground, it was high-tech's pod hymnal.</p> <p>Maybe now their time has come, but not at all in the fashion anticipated by the stoned clairvoyants of the Sixties and Seventies. So far from letting it all hang out, 2008 Stirling Prize winners Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios are stuffing it all back in. This idealistic and enlightened practice has a creative reuse studio which has just launched its 'eco pod'. Specifically designed to bring new life to the beautiful and often derelict field barns of the Yorkshire Dales, the eco pod is an idea suddenly absolutely consonant with the chastened spirit of the age. </p> <p>The eco pod is a freestanding wooden structure inserted into an existing building with minimal visual disruption externally. Intended as holiday homes, services are provided on a trailer towed to the site by the local farmer. Only one exists at the moment (on the Duke of Devonshire's Bolton Abbey Estate near Harrogate), but FCB is developing a modular design that can be adapted to all manner of structures and circumstances. At a moment when it is timely to reconsider appetites for excess consumption and extravagant statements, the artfully humble eco pod surely has a relevance beyond the holiday home.</p> <p>For one thing, the elegant simplicity of the wooden structures suggests the 'primitive hut' of architectural theory. I asked FCB designer Geoff Rich to comment: 'Yes, it's primitive in that it meets our basic needs, but eco pod achieves this through extreme sophistication in design and process. Materials - wood and sheep's wool insulation - are indeed crude, but the eco pod appeals to our finer instincts: a need for quiet, solitude, reflection and fresh experience.' </p> <p>There are other pods emerging. Aidan Quinn has produced one for his company Eco Hab, a self-contained thermally efficient prefab of startling ugliness, as if ambitious garden gnomes had reworked a primitive Apulian trulli. With rather more style, a young Polish firm called Front Architects of Poznan is proposing a Single Hauz, a modernist response to the disintegration of the nuclear family. Compelling Computer Generated Images show the Single Hauz standing free and supporting itself and its sole occupant in dramatic landscapes. Meanwhile, in absolute contrast to the implied austerity of podlife, first class cabins on aircraft are increasingly providing glossy travellers with self-contained spaces, little buildings within vast airframes. And when Mrs Bush recently travelled to Afghanistan in a military C17 Globemaster III transport, she did so in a personal pod secured in the cavernous hold by netting.</p> <p>Something is going and it is irresistible to conjecture a psycho-analysis of the pod. In these challenging times we seek security and, as in a womb or a cave, a pod offers gratifying emotional rewards. Children intuitively play enclosure games, enjoying hiding under tables and so on. This search for the aedicule, the basic structural unit, was, according to John Summerson, the very source of architectural thinking. Moreover, our pleasure in cars is often derived, not from the A-to-B vectors, but from the pleasing sense of enclosure they offer. Additionally, solitude is being seen as an asset not a disadvantage. Pod architecture, it seems, touches the deep eremitism in all of us: Thoreau's life in the woods goes shopping at Ikea.</p> <p>But there is also something in understated pods eloquent of a widening dissatisfaction with the vulgarity and irrelevance of global celebrity architecture. Ironically, Zaha Hadid has just revealed a structure in New York's Central Park which, inspired by the Nautilus shell, has podlike characteristics. This is the Chanel Pavilion, a temple of fake art for the credulous rich. In the New York Times Nicolai Ouroussoff praised Hadid for her creative ingenuity, but damned the project in a sentence that perfectly explains pod allure: 'One would hope that our economic crisis leads us to a new level of introspection and that architects will feel compelled to devote their talents to more worthwhile - dare I say idealistic - causes.'</p> <p>The FCB, Eco Hab and Single Hauz pods are not so much startling solutions as directions, comments, meditations. Buckminster Fuller's question about the weight of a house was founded on a criticism of wasted materials, common in his day. Today, too much building is hobbled by other sorts of extraneous weight and waste: overblown ambition, ham-fisted expressiveness, a crude desire to impress, reckless use of resources. </p> <p>Architecture concentrated on the disciplines of pod design gets architecture back to the essence: providing pleasing and efficient shelter. Buckminster Fuller made a wrong call about materials, but he was surely right in saying: 'A home, like a person, must as completely as possible be independent and self-supporting, have its own character, dignity and beauty or harmony.'</p> <p>It's pleasant to note that the Yorkshire Dales, not the City of London, is host to the most interesting architectural innovation of recent years.</p>",
  "<p>There was a time, not so long ago, when sexual imagery was not readily available to youthful eyes. In this vanished world, the pubescent male had his work cut out when it came to finding material to feed his hormonal appetites. But in this particular field of endeavour, adolescents once displayed an uncharacteristic willingness to do the work.</p> <p>Everything from Sunday newspaper supplements to mail order catalogues was examined with the diligence of a librarian collating an index. A feature on stockings - interesting. An advert for a bra - bingo! And on more bountiful days, perhaps in the dentist's waiting room, the perfumed pages of fashion magazines might reveal an admirable artistic contempt for such dreary conventions as clothing. You'd take a filling or two for such small triumphs. In these restrained conditions, any sign, or even suggestion, of female flesh would be duly noted and stored in the memory bank for later reference.</p> <p>This was a time, the Seventies, when DH Lawrence novels, in which characters were bedevilled with throbbing 'loins', still enjoyed a risqu\u00e9 reputation. In my school library, which was in no respect a literary environment, Lady Chatterley's Lover was on permanent loan. At home, popular novels, like The Godfather, were speed-scanned for promising words - 'skirt', 'underwear', 'unbuttoned' - that might lead to action passages. In a demonstration of the kind of solidarity for which teenage boys are seldom credited, the workload was sometimes eased by better-read teenagers who shared page numbers.</p> <p>For those of us who came of age when Mary Whitehouse was the enemy, not the subject, of television drama, the TV was scarcely a more reliable source of inspiration. This was the era of three channels, none of which was exactly racy. Even the Taliban would have found little worthy of stoning. There were re-runs of The Avengers, with Diana Rigg as Emma Peel, often dressed in leather or tied up in ironic jeopardy, but in terms of actual bedside activity, whole weeks and months could go by with not so much as a fleeting nipple.</p> <p>Occasionally TV did let its hair down, in series like the legendary Bouquet of Barbed Wire, of which Clive James wrote: 'By the end, everybody had been to bed with everybody else except the baby.' Yet the question remained: how could you watch Susan Penhaligon in all her generous glory with your parents in the same room? Better to affect a nonchalant interest as you examined the cover of a Pink Floyd album.</p> <p>And somewhere, beyond the truncated reach of everyday life, was the clammy presence of pornography, furtive, semi-legal contraband. I recall the anxious drama of getting in to see the X-certificate Black Emmanuelle at the Camden Plaza when I was 14 years old. A group of friends and I spent about half an hour outside the cinema working up the courage to try to pass for 18-year-olds. As a result of our pointless deliberations - the cashier would probably have taken money from the occupant of a pram - we missed the beginning. Fortunately, it wasn't difficult to catch up with the plot.</p> <p>Still, porn in the Seventies in Britain was almost entirely centred on magazines. They ranged from well-known titles like Playboy and Penthouse at the softer end of the market, glossy forests of pubes which were available in newsagents, to the gynaecological hardcore whose provenance was less obvious. The first time I ever saw the latter sort was when I was about nine years old. A boy named Joseph at my primary school showed me a series of photos he'd ripped out of a magazine. They were in lurid shiny colour, and they depicted a nurse and a male patient. The first picture was almost banal. Although the nurse was conspicuously attractive, and seemed to be wearing rather too much make-up and an unusually short uniform, she was just taking the patient's temperature.</p> <p>After that the proceedings became progressively less medical. I can vividly recall the look of diabolical pride Joseph wore when he showed the last photo, an image which defied not just belief but everything - admittedly not a great deal - I understood at the time about the nature of human relations. </p> <p>The man had an erection. This was not in itself a revelation, for I'd heard rumours of such things. But it was what the nurse was doing with it that was so astounding. Appearing to have mistaken it for an ice lolly, she was sucking it. Why? Why on earth, I wondered, would someone do something so bizarre and distasteful? And was a nurse going to do that to me when I grew up?</p> <p>The information contained in this image was shocking news from elsewhere, a preview of a world that made no sense to the pre-pubescent mind. Everyone in the playground wanted to see the pictures, and such was the excitement they inspired that within a few minutes they lay torn and disfigured at the frenzied hands of the mob.</p> <p>The flyblown sheet from a porn mag is one of those aspects of street litter, like white dog's droppings, that seem to have disappeared from city life. In my youth, images of disembodied genitalia were often to be found discarded in the street. So the association of pornography with the gutter was in a sense literal before it was political, though it became political for many of us in the Eighties.</p> <p>During that decade, the influence of feminism gave rise to the New Man, the male who was in favour of sexual equality, sympathetic to female-only solutions, and ball-crushingly sensitive to the 'objectification' of women. In this atmosphere of pronounced gender grievance, pornography was the preserve of the misogynist, the sexist pig and, not least, the rapist. To the sisterhood's perceived puritanism and the dull earnestness of their male supporters, there soon followed a backlash.</p> <p>As if to mark the birth of a new age, the leaders of the backlash were quickly awarded a name - the New Lads. Their manifesto called for guiltless fun, irony and a more knockabout attitude to pornography. There were none of the grand claims for sexual liberation that the hippies had made. Instead, the New Lads claimed that it was just a matter of having a laugh and not taking everything too seriously. Let's be grown up about this, was their argument, by being more boyish. At the same time, a new generation of women became bored or disillusioned with what they saw as the shrill joylessness of old-style feminism.</p> <p>Thus the stigma attached to porn was replaced with a kind of worldly acceptance, even approval. Porn became cool, after a fashion, and to be anti-porn became square. The only people to take porn seriously, aside from a few feminist dinosaurs, were the businesses that made millions with the advent of videos, DVDs and, most significantly, the internet.</p> <p>Nowadays porn is everywhere. Young men look at it without apology or shame. Sometimes young women too. Society has become radically more sexualised, and sex, which has always sold, has been transformed into a much more explicit commodity. What seems particularly notable is that women have become more active and willing participants in the pornification of female sexuality. Everywhere from the growth in breast implants and cosmetic surgery to the proliferation of bikini wax salons to the trendiness of Agent Provocateur to the transformation of glamour models into role models - a porn aesthetic has taken root in everyday life.</p> <p>At the same time, the most graphic and extreme depictions of every conceivable sexual scenario with every imaginable permutation of humanity (and not just humanity) is accessible at the click of a computer mouse. A wealth - or a poverty? - of porn channels is available on satellite television. Weekly lads' magazines carry pictures of unfeasibly pneumatic teenage girls whose singular aim is to convince readers that they think of nothing but sex. Lap-dancing bars have spread like a virus. Rap music and videos portray women as venal nymphomaniacs. Minor nobodies become minor celebrities through the dissemination of their private sex tapes. And arthouse cinema has begun to feature unsimulated scenes of sexual intercourse.</p> <p>Leaving aside the deep and shallowing impact such developments may have made on society at large, it's worth asking what effect they have had on the adolescent male imagination. What do teen boys now think of girls and women? Of course, they've always fantasised that they were secretly wanton hussies. That's what boys do. But it was a teen fantasy supported by little more than bra adverts and DH Lawrence. Now, though, there is an abundance of evidence to suggest the fantasy is real. And as a consequence, the world looks an awful lot like a teenager's wet dream.</p> <p>That might mean that adolescents are now in a permanent state of overstimulation, their every tumescent thought reflected and enhanced by an instant visual representation, which is in turn mimicked by compliant teen girls. Or it could add up to the opposite, that the ubiquity of pornography has created a kind of blas\u00e9, seen-it-all contempt, a familiarity with excess that leaves the imagination not sated but empty and disappointed. Neither option sounds healthy or even enjoyable. And perhaps neither is the norm. </p> <p>None the less, growing up in the age of porn must often be confusing, working out what you desire when your desires are already worked out for you, full of carnal knowledge and ignorant of its related emotions, seeing so much and feeling so little.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/planning\">flagship plan</a> to build a string of environmentally friendly '<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ecotowns\">eco-towns</a>' across Britain has been dealt a critical blow, with only two of the 10 sites promised now expected to be built.</p> <p>The model green communities, where residents would be able to do without cars and <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/environment/food\">grow their own</a> food on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/organicgardening\">allotments</a>, were billed as the most imaginative answer to putting roofs over heads in half a century. But the plans are now in jeopardy thanks to a combination of the credit crunch, a collapsing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/housingmarket\">construction industry</a> and fierce local opposition.</p> <p>Officials at the Department for Communities and Local Government have concluded only 'one or two' of the 15 shortlisted projects are genuinely viable, according to a source close to the discussions. The Eco-Towns Challenge Panel, appointed by ministers to ensure the plans were genuinely green, is understood to have reached similar conclusions. Some bidders have already dropped out, while others are said to have been alarmed by the house price crash and the collapse in sales.</p> <p>The final decision on how many should go forward is yet to be taken by Margaret Beckett, the new housing minister. But she failed to mention either eco-towns or the government's wider target to build three million new homes by 2020 - which housing experts are also now openly questioning - when she made her first speech to the Home Builders Federation's annual conference last week.</p> <p>The news comes as Brown prepares to hail green industries tomorrow as a new source of job creation in Britain. Geoff Hoon, the Transport Secretary, will announce plans to boost the manufacture of electric cars which ministers hope could become more appealing, as they are exempt from congestion charges and also save on petrol. He will announce a \u00a320m grant for businesses to buy electric vans.</p> <p>Eco-towns are, however, central to Brown's vision for the environment. They were one of the first major ideas he announced within days of becoming Labour leader, pledging thousands of new homes in every part of the country. Four months later, he doubled his original target of five towns because of interest in the scheme, adding: 'For the first time in nearly half a century we will show the imagination to build new towns - eco-towns with low- and zero-carbon homes.'</p> <p>Although only a small amount of the three million planned new homes, eco-towns were intended to encourage other builders.</p> <p>'The government will probably say it's all to do with the economic climate but I think the mistake was their approach to the subject,' said Grant Shapps, the Tory housing spokesman.</p> <p>'They came up with a good idea but they messed it up by going for a top-down \"ministers know best where they should go\" approach.'</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government insisted the programme would remain on track.</p>",
  "<p>It came as no surprise to hear that 72 per cent of people in the UK, according to The Observer poll, have never slept with someone of a different colour; probably because I'm one of them. </p> <p>I've only had two sexual partners, which is rare for a 27-year-old, especially one working in the media industry. Like me, both guys, including my current boyfriend, are black Londoners.</p> <p>I've always had a preference for black men. Growing up in a house with my father and three older brothers probably did the trick. But while this inclination suits me, I never expect the same of other people.</p> <p>Two of my brothers are in mixed-race relationships. One has a white girlfriend, who is due to give birth to a boy next month, and the other has an Indian wife, who is expecting their first child next spring. </p> <p>Whenever I meet my siblings' new partners, the first things I study are their personalities and behaviour. Protecting my brothers from bunny-boilers is far more important than skin colour.</p> <p>It doesn't surprise me that many people, according to the poll, would consider having sex with someone of another shade. Desire often takes precedence over prejudice. Maybe the delay is down to the fact that they haven't met the right people yet.</p> <p>In my experience, most people who advocate same-race relationships would still sleep with someone from outside of their race. </p> <p>A close friend of mine - an attractive 35-year-old single, black woman - refuses to date outside her race. She's prepared to travel as far as the Caribbean or America to find her Mr Right, and she fears that European and Asian women are, as she puts it, 'taking our men away'. Nevertheless, she also admits to fantasising about having a one-night stand with the Swedish footballer Freddie Ljungberg. </p> <p>Our environment has a huge influence over who we become attracted to. Britain is one of the world's greatest cultural melting pots. With so many different races, colours, religions and ethnicities to choose from, it's inevitable that some of us will cross cultures and break family traditions when it comes to dating, sex or marriage. </p> <p>Another friend is the daughter of a former British National Party member. When we were at school she was too petrified to date black guys. However, she slept with 'a handful' after her father left the BNP some years later. She eventually settled down with a white partner, while her younger sister had a child with an African immigrant in 2003. </p> <p>An eccentric, but lovable, black girl I've known for 20 years has slept with a diverse range of partners, including a mixed-race hip-hop head, an African-American basketball player, an Albanian builder, and an English West Ham fan, who is the father of her four-year-old daughter. In contrast, the majority of the Muslim girls I went to school with are married to Muslim men. Most of my Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian peers were never allowed out after school. </p> <p>Looking back, if my parents had given me the same treatment as that received by my Muslim peers, I probably wouldn't have kissed three local white boys (not on the same day of course). </p> <p>My family lived on the Isle of Dogs in the heart of east London for over 30 years, until 2001. It's a close-knit community. Most of my white classmates' parents, grandparents, uncles, aunties, cousins, brothers and sisters all went to school together. Most people from the Isle of Dogs have families that have lived in the area for generations.</p> <p>It's rare for them to marry outside of their community. The majority of the people from my secondary school have had children with each other; and earlier this month, a girl from my science class announced on Facebook that she'd got engaged to James, a boy I used to sit next to in form registration. </p> <p>In the place where I grew up, blacks, Asians and whites are more likely to sleep with each other than with someone from outside the area. Crossing cultures is OK, but dating outside of the borough is a no-no. </p> <p>Generally, blacks, Asians and whites have had more than 50 years to get to know each other. As a result, attitudes towards interracial relationships have changed and having sexual encounters with someone from another race is less of a taboo.</p> <p>According to the results of the poll, men are more inclined to choose a partner from another race. I find this to be true of my male friends. The only guy I know who said he'd never sleep with a white girl, did. And while Muslim girls seemed more inclined to stick to family tradition, some of their male counterparts didn't. </p> <p>Even so, outside of their environment I don't believe there's any real reason why some people are attracted to mixed-race relationships. What is clear, however, is that it matters a lot less now than it did half a century ago.</p> <p>Sexual attraction simply boils down to who you fancy, which is sometimes not determined by colour. And if you prefer to have a partner of the same race, then who really cares? </p> <p>Ultimately, it's up to you to decide who to lie down with. But to those living in the stressful world of Britain, I'd advise you to check out that person's state of mind before worrying about their skin tone. </p> <p>\u2022 Akosua Annobil-Dodoo is the editor of <a href=\"http://www.overgroundonline.com/\">overgroundonline.com</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Sunday October 26 2008.

  "<p>Many British savers with money tied up in overseas accounts that offer princely returns could be forgiven for casting a wary eye at the banks behind their accounts this weekend.</p> <p>Last week Dutch bank ING, which recently scooped up billions of pounds of savings belonging to those formerly with Icelandic bank Kaupthing Edge, revealed that it been given a staggering \u20ac10bn (\u00a37.9bn) injection from the Netherlands government.</p> <p>The money will be used to shore up its balance sheet and, as ING itself puts it, 'create a strong buffer to navigate the current market and economic environment'.The Dutch government also weighed in to stress that its reinforcement gave ING 'robust financial resilience'.</p> <p>Yet for the tens of thousands of UK savers with the failed Kaupthing Edge who saw their money swept into ING by the British government, there is gnawing uncertainty over how safe their bank is, and what will happen to their high interest rates.</p> <p>The financial crisis has sent ripples of fear through the savings community, and prompted many with money in an overseas bank to wonder if it might not be a better idea to bring it closer to home, despite financial guarantees that are just as robust - if not more generous - than the UK's. The choice for British savers - to choose another overseas bank for new savings, leave existing overseas cash where it is, or pull it out - will depend on their attitude to perceived risk. </p> <p>In an attempt to gauge whether a bank has enough financial muscle to ride out the turbulence, many are choosing to look at a bank's credit rating - the 'badge of health' given to it by a ratings agency such as Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), Moody's or Fitch. These ratings start with the safest of all - 'AAA' - and work down through varieties of Bs and Cs, to lower ratings that indicate a bank is much less healthy than it could be.</p> <p>'You can check credit ratings, but the average man in the street may not understand them. Obviously a triple-A is the best - but the thing is, they can change very quickly, as we saw with the Icelandic banks,' says Rachel Thrussell at financial analyst Moneyfacts. 'Unless you keep an eye on the credit rating, and do so regularly, it'll be very hard to know where it's at.' </p> <p>You normally have to pay for up-to-date data although research on financial websites can yield a crop of recent ratings. But Martin Lewis, who runs Moneysavingexpert.com, says any attempt to try to pick which bank will be next to fail is 'virtually impossible'. 'The best thing to do is to rely on the protection, not the rumour mill,' he says, and spread your cash around banks operating under separate banking licences. Far better, agrees Thrussell, to check that any overseas bank you save with is registered with its national regulator, and offers you enough protection in the event of collapse.</p> <p>Here we take a closer look at some of the popular overseas banks including their interest rates, stability and compensation schemes. </p> <h2>ING</h2> <p><strong>Rates:</strong><strong> </strong>In July, Kaupthing Edge revamped its offer to give a table-topping 7.15 per cent on a one-year fixed-term deposit account on sums from \u00a31,000, and a meaty 6.5 per cent on its instant access account; for its savers who are now with ING, the future is unlikely to be anywhere near as generous.</p> <p>While ING's easy-access direct savings rate is 6 per cent, it includes a 1.67 per cent bonus that runs out after 12 months, and its fixed-rate savings deal offers 5.5 per cent - but only if you hold a minimum of \u00a35,000. Savers who had less than this in a Kaupthing account face a very uncertain future, with neither reassurances of rates being kept high nor any promise of a swift decision given. 'All the situations are being looked at and are still under review, and ING will duly inform Kaupthing savers,' a spokesman says.</p> <p><strong>Credit rating: </strong>Last week Standard &amp; Poor's gave ING an 'AA' rating. S&amp;P says that rating shows the bank to have 'a very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments'.</p> <p><strong>Compensation:</strong><strong> </strong>Any ING savers concerned about compensation should take comfort from the Dutch deposit guarantee compensation scheme, which guarantees to pay out more than the UK's Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS); it will cover up to \u20ac100,000 (approximately \u00a379,000) - much more than the UK's \u00a350,000.</p> <h2>ICICI</h2> <p><strong>Rates:</strong> On Wednesday the rate on Indian bank ICICI UK's barnstorming 7.2 per cent one-year HiSave Fixed Rate account will be chopped by an as-yet-unspecified amount. Although accounts opened up to and including Wednesday, with at least a \u00a31,000 deposit, will still qualify for its stellar rate, the cut will dim the bank's lustre.</p> <p><strong>Credit rating:</strong><strong> </strong>Recently there was a small panic among ICICI customers after a service fault prevented its online banking service from working. Coming just days after the Icelandic banks' demise, it was enough to prompt a rush of worried calls to customer service lines and force the Indian banking giant to put up a sign on its website reassuring customers that it wasn't in financial trouble. Last week, its Standard &amp; Poor's rating stood at a 'BBB', which S&amp;P says indicates a bank with 'adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments'. But the rating does come with a proviso that 'adverse economic conditions... are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity... to meet its financial commitments'.</p> <p><strong>Compensation:</strong> The first \u00a350,000 is covered by the UK's FSCS; anything above this would depend on the severity of any crash. While the government guaranteed all IceSave savings held by UK savers, there's no guarantee the same would apply if another foreign bank collapsed. </p> <h2>FirstSave</h2> <p><strong>Rates: </strong>FirstSave, whose accounts are provided by FBN Bank (UK) - a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Bank of Nigeria - has now withdrawn its competitive 6.75 per cent deal for a one-year fixed-rate bond; interest paid out on its less competitive Easy Access account has also been pushed down.</p> <p>Peter Hinson, FBN (UK)'s managing director, says a flood of money into its accounts lay behind the decision temporarily to suspend the fixed-rate offer: 'We will accept new money again, but not until some time in November,' he says. The rate, although yet to be set, is unlikely to be as high as before as interest rates around the world ease down.</p> <p><strong>Credit rating: </strong>S&amp;P rates FBN as 'BB', which it says underlines 'ongoing uncertainties and exposure to adverse business, financial or economic conditions which could lead to... inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments'.</p> <p><strong>Compensation: </strong>The first \u00a350,000 is covered by the FSCS.</p>",
  "<p>When there's a landslide, you can feel the earth shake beneath your feet. And - goodness! - are those Rupert Murdoch's knees I see knocking in the distance?</p> <p>Last week the trickle of American editorial columns revealing their election choice turned to a flood: 105 for Obama versus a paltry 33 for McCain (when Editor and Publisher magazine did its sums). That's already 10 million circulation copies versus 2.5 million. And it gets worse for the Republicans with every passing publication day. The press and the polls chime as one. Hail to commander-in-chief Barack.</p> <p>But what's this big vote - 702,000 copies' worth - going in the other direction? Why, that's Murdoch's New York Post. And don't dare forget Fox News, with its fawning Sarah Palin interviews, rabid comment panels and general curl of a non-liberal lip. The outward and visible Murdoch isn't turning Democrat this time around. Rather, it seems, he's sticking his chin out and putting the boot in to the last.</p> <p>Except that this is also where you hear those knees knocking - or, at least, the sound of an old Aussie thumb getting a terrible sucking. Of course, the mighty empire isn't monolithic to begin with. Murdoch's Post may have endorsed McCain weeks ago, but his Times of London has publicly gone down the Obama track (just as it took a different tack from its Sunday sister last British time around). Come to think of it, didn't Rupert himself go wooing Obama to do Fox interviews in the teeth of growls from the channel's charismatic supremo, Roger Ailes? Isn't 'fair and balanced' the somewhat risible Fox slogan anyway?</p> <p>For there is, looking closer, a sub-text here that instructs on the real nature of the relationship between Citizen Rupe and the political classes. Call it an uneasy stand-off. News Corporation, the mightiest and most opinionated media giant on Earth, couldn't keep its erstwhile hero, George W Bush, aloft in popularity polls. Neither - despite much nudging - could it make Hillary Clinton a nomination winner. The force was with Obama, and no amount of condemnation, questioning or simple propaganda could blow it away. </p> <p>One landslide, moreover, can lead to another. Suppose a walloping Obama victory is paralleled by a similar triumph in Senate and House races. Suppose a new Democratic President is master of all he surveys and, for a time, very popular. Fox will then appear defeated itself, neutered, no longer cock of the TV walk - and there's another grisly threat in waiting.</p> <p>The New York Post itself has one premonition of doom. It carries an opinion piece from a notable right-wing campaigner, Brian Anderson, raising the spectre of a new Fairness Doctrine and eponymous Act. From 1949 until the advent of Ronald Reagan, the old Fairness Act kept radio and TV stations roughly in check. It didn't enforce an impartiality that would have kept the BBC awake at night, but it did guarantee some kind of access and overall balance on the airwaves. Now - backed by favourable summer polls, with 47 per cent in favour and 39 per cent against - it could be on its way back.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, would like mandatory fairness prescribed by law again. Others at her side fancy community boards charged with making sure that the large chain stations put down roots in the cities they dominate. Obama himself is said to favour renewing radio licences every two years, not letting them lie for eight at a time. Perhaps he doesn't favour the whole fairness package, but he surely wouldn't veto it if his Democrats on Capitol Hill went their own ways. Cue unimaginable horror.</p> <p>'A new Fairness Doctrine would drive political talk radio off the dial,' quavers Anderson. 'If a station ran a big-audience conservative programme... it would also have to run a left-leaning alternative'. But, since nobody listen to liberal radio, 'stations would probably have to trim back conservative shows to avoid airing unsuccessful liberal ones'.</p> <p>It may seem a baroque sort of censorship, but it's out there, waiting for an Obama administration - and there's nothing even Murdoch can do about it apart from smile nicely. The larger your corporation, the wider your spread of interests - and the more vulnerable you become. Fairness and balance tests for 'fair and balanced' Fox News? It could be a killer blow. 'We will fight to the end for our ability to put occasionally controversial, offensive and even tasteless content on air,' says Peter Chernin, News Corp's chief operating officer. </p> <p>But don't fight the inevitable, so expect rather more than 100 days of dulcet acquiescence. Expect a benign Wall Street Journal, a muzzled Post and Fox News for once actually doing what its slogan claims. Will that stave off doctrines of right-wing despair? Possibly, for the most part. The 105 Barack endorsees don't love Rush Limbaugh and friends, but they'll be anxious about Washington telling them what to do. There'll be a natural press and TV majority crying 'hands off'. </p> <p>But nobody - least of all Mr M - will be putting the knife in. Keep Roger Ailes in quarantine as balanced threat meets excruciatingly balanced response.</p> <h2>Wapping displays a lack of joined-up thinking over the internet</h2> <p>There are two key races in the newspaper world. One is traditional: that for print copy circulation. The other is rather more mystic: how many unique users drop in to your website? This second battle has two great leaders, the Guardian and the Telegraph</p> <p>In September, the Guardian topped 24 million and the Telegraph hit 22.9 million, record figures clearly boosted by mordant credit crunch checkers (which meant an extra million UK-based visitors - 9.8 million in all to the Guardian site and 7.2 million domestic users for the Telegraph</p> <p>But there's an issue here as well as simple statistics. The two front-runners have ploughed huge money into development and integration, bringing newsrooms and journalist teams together to mount a powerful, constantly updated service. But where's the Times in all this? It's number one for financial readers in print, comfortably beating the FT; yet, in crunch September, it could only finish a relatively distant third with 20.3 million unique users. </p> <p>That was a record, too, but still a pretty non-integrated one. As September ended, the online chief for both the Times and Sunday Times - the feisty Anne Spackman - found herself moved over to run Times comment, to be replaced by two editors, one for the daily, one for the Sunday. </p> <p>A pretty clear signal. The Sunday Times is too rich and grand to want its staff to work around the clock, and the Times also seems to like being alone. But can determined non-integration deliver the goods that working together appears to provide? It would be very odd to find Wapping standing on its dignity and shifting sands at such a crucial time.</p> <h2>Blogging and the Beast</h2> <p>So it's farewell lone blogger, the big battalions have got you. Or so Paul Boutin finds in the latest edition of Wired. 'Scroll down Technorati's list of the top 100 blogs and you'll find personal sites have been shoved side by professional ones. Most are essentially online magazines ... and a stand-alone commentator can't keep up with a team of pro writers cranking out up to 30 posts a day'.</p> <p>Enter, pat on cue, Tina Brown and <a href=\"http://www.Thedailybeast.com\">Thedailybeast.com</a>, which is so much like a magazine that it cost a reported $18m to launch. Can online possibly sustain an investment like that? Ah! hello again, lone blogger ... at least you're cheap.</p> <h2>A change in weather for public service</h2> <p>Huge tomes are constructed these days trying to define public-service journalism, but here's a two-minute test (courtesy of Mikhail Gorbachev's World Political Forum and a recent conference of editors and climate-change editors from all over the globe).</p> <p>'Because investigative reporting is time and resource consuming, news organisations should make an ethical and financial commitment to reporting climate change. We understand that making such a financial commitment is a challenge ... but we should make a fundamental change from the current situation, where too few news organisations have reporters who understand science and how it works.'</p> <p>Simple question for the editor, then? Who's covering global warming for you, and what credentials does he or she have? That's public service.</p> <h2>Playing dumb</h2> <p>What does a union general secretary do when he's got members on both sides of a dispute? He plays dumb, or 'slightly bemused'. That's Jeremy Dear of the National Union of Journalists, implicitly siding with his BBC members rather than his regional press membership in the row over local Beeb ultra-local internet sites. Can't see the problem, says Jeremy. The BBC doesn't take ads, does it?</p> <p>No, but it takes readers away from the local papers whose newsrooms supply much of BBC content. And when readers go, ads go. Surely Mr Dear can see the problem? If he can't, then his members on both sides have a problem, too.</p>",
  "<p>Football matches imprint themselves upon the memory for a variety of reasons. Contrary to what one may imagine, it is rarely for the quality of play. The connoisseur, drawn back to classics, is often disappointed by how play has moved on: great players of the past now look slow-witted.</p> <p>One match, however, when returned to, proves to be of an astonishing quality: the second semi-final of the 1982 World Cup, between West Germany and France. Michel Platini was the French captain that night and has said: 'That was my most beautiful game. What happened in those two hours encapsulated all the sentiments of life itself. No film or play could ever recapture so many contradictions and emotions. It was complete. So strong. It was fabulous.'</p> <p>West Germany's presence in the semis was not widely welcomed. In their opening group game, Algeria, 1,000-1 outsiders to win the competition, had beaten the European champions 2-1. After Algeria defeated Chile in their final group game, Austria and West Germany met a day later knowing that if the Germans won by either one or two goals they would both go through. </p> <p>The first 10 minutes were played at a furious pace until the deadlock was broken by a Horst Hrubesch goal for the Germans. Thereafter, for the remaining 80 minutes, both teams strolled around the pitch, passing the ball sideways and backwards. There was not a single meaningful shot on goal. The outraged, largely Spanish crowd yelled 'Fuera, fuera' ('Out, out'). Algerian supporters waved banknotes at the players. One West German fan burned his national flag in protest.</p> <p>The West German camp failed to appreciate what all the fuss was about. Coach Jupp Derwall said: 'We wanted to progress, not play football.' When fans gathered in front of the squad hotel, demanding the players justify themselves, members of the team threw water-filled balloons on their own supporters from the windows of their rooms. </p> <p>Their semi-final was at the Estadio Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n, on 8 July 1982. Kick-off was 9pm but it was a muggy night in Seville, with the temperature in the high nineties. France had a day fewer to recover from their last group match, but this handicap had been balanced by nature, a stomach bug affecting their opponents. The F\u00f6rster brothers and striker Klaus Fischer were among those affected.</p> <p>Michel Platini and the bearded Manny Kaltz, standing in as captain for Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who was on the bench with a damaged hamstring, shook hands with the officials: Dutch referee Charles Corver and his linesmen, Swiss Bruno Galler and Scot Robert Valentine. The captains tossed a coin, swapped pennants. There was a noisy, carnivalesque atmosphere. </p> <p>During the early stages Germany were in charge. Paul Breitner, the only survivor of West Germany's 1974 World Cup-winning side, had retired from the national team but been persuaded back by Derwall: playing now not at full-back but in central midfield, Breitner had become his team's marshal. He would set off on diagonal runs, driving into space in French territory, spearing passes for his colleagues to run on to. A sense of purpose coursed through German moves. </p> <p>In the 17th minute Breitner cadged the ball off midfield grafter Wolfgang Dremmler just inside the France half and, seeing space ahead of him, burst into it, brushing off Didier Six's feeble challenge. Breitner headed towards the middle then, faced by a wall of blue, veered off towards the left before stabbing the ball with the outside of his right foot perfectly into the path of Klaus Fischer. Jean-Luc Ettori rushed out from his goal and dived at Fischer's feet: he blocked the run but failed to gather the ball, which rolled slowly back out towards the edge of the penalty area. It was teed up nicely for young Pierre Littbarski, West Germany's find of the tournament, who drilled it through a litter of French bodies and into the net.</p> <p><strong>One-nil.</strong></p> <p>Where the West Germany players seemed to have settled to a similar tempo, the same speed of thought and movement, the French were more moody. Marius Tr\u00e9sor and Bernard Janvion in the middle of the defence and Maxime Bossis on the right all had their socks rolled down, Bossis with his shin-pads flapping out, as if to flaunt their insouciance. Up front the team were light and lop-sided. Dominique Rocheteau had made his name as a pacy right-winger at Saint-Etienne. He was dark and handsome, with the flowing ringlets of a musketeer; fans of Les Verts called Rocheteau 'The Green Angel', although his looks belied both his work-rate and, rare for a footballer, his political awareness: known for his left-wing views and association with the Revolutionary Communist League, today Rocheteau is head of the National Commission of Ethics of the French Football Association.</p> <p>Playing as a lone striker, however, was too great a burden, especially as he received little help from Six - a winger with corkscrew hair, an ornamental player out on the left who occasionally drifted inside to scant purpose.</p> <p>If the France forwards suffered in comparison with those behind them, it could be said that so would anyone. The midfield was led by Platini, described by one journalist as 'the lead violin in a sophisticated string quartet'. Patrolling the ground between centre circle and opposition penalty area, Platini was invariably in the right place to receive a pass and did so alone, when one might have expected an opponent to be beside him. He then became the still centre of a hurtling world, aware of all that could happen. For a moment it was as if the other players became satellites of his calm mind. He would make a pass into inexplicable space, which it would take a second or two for the game to catch up with: Bossis or Jean Tigana ran on to the ball, and only then could everyone see how exquisite the pass was.</p> <p>The rest of the quartet was not bad. Alain Giresse, just 5ft 4in, had a good engine and a lovely cushioned touch with his right boot. Tigana, a team-mate of Giresse at Bordeaux, had not become a professional until his early twenties, spotted as an amateur while working as a postman. Though slight, and elegant, Tigana was a powerful runner with the ball. He also had a markedly slow heartbeat and tremendous stamina.</p> <p>The fourth member was Bernard Genghini, a leggy left-footer as elegant as, if a little less effective than, his colleagues. 'Four artists,' as Brian Glanville puts it in The History of the World Cup, 'no real hard man, no tackler, among them.'</p> <p>Having scored their goal, there was no let-up in West Germany's attacking momentum. But France, too, began to string passes together. Tr\u00e9sor drove forward in a manner rarely seen from stoppers today. Full-back Manny Kaltz caught Genghini after the ball had gone. Genghini bit him back, but France had the free-kick, midway between centre circle and penalty area on the left-hand side. Giresse floated the ball with the outside of his right foot into the right-hand side of the area. Platini outjumped Dremmler to head the ball towards the six-yard line, where Berndt F\u00f6rster made his clearing volley easier by wrestling Rocheteau out of the way with an arm around his waist. Corver had no hesitation in blowing his whistle and pointing to the penalty spot.</p> <p>Platini kissed the ball before placing it on the spot, and walking backwards. On the goalline, chewing gum, gloved hands on hips, Harald Schumacher glared at the ball, at Platini, at the effrontery of a penalty awarded against West Germany. Platini kept walking back. For a moment it looked like he might forget to stop walking. He reached the edge of the penalty area, and still kept going. Was he intimidated by Schumacher's cold-eyed gaze? Still he kept retreating, right through the arc outside the penalty area. Finally Platini stopped, began walking, then jogging, back. Schumacher flung himself to his left. Platini struck the ball with the flat of his right foot, sending it just inside the opposite post. </p> <p><strong>One-all, after 27 minutes.</strong></p> <p>West Germany resumed possession. The game was rougher 25 years ago than it is today. The France left-back Manuel Amoros had got away with hacks at Littbarski; now Tigana, scuttling with the ball out of defence after a West German attack had been repelled, was brutally taken out by Dremmler in a way that now would earn an instant yellow card, at least.</p> <p>Tr\u00e9sor made another irruption into the West German half, passing the ball, continuing his run towards the left-hand corner flag, receiving the return pass, laying the ball back to Amoros, who crossed. Six flicked it on ineffectually, too far from Platini, too close to the goalkeeper. Schumacher contrived not only to gather the ball unimpeded but to keep moving and thump Platini's thigh with his shoulder. Platini, wincing, complained. It was an act of petty aggression for which Schumacher knew he would receive no punishment - he had the ball in his hands, no referee would have given a penalty - but it was a taste of what was to come.</p> <p>The second half was barely under way when Rocheteau received the ball in an unthreatening position out on the right, facing his own goal, whereupon Berndt F\u00f6rster, running up behind him, jumped and somehow kneed Rocheteau in the shoulder. It was an imbecilic assault, for which F\u00f6rster was fortunate to receive only a yellow card. </p> <p>Genghini had taken a knock and, unable to run it off, was replaced. As Patrick Battiston ran on to the pitch a West German cross from the right drifted all the way over to Bossis, who controlled the ball, dummied first to pass it back, then to hoof it upfield, only to waltz around Felix Magath and Fischer before releasing the ball to Tigana on the right. Tigana slipped it inside to Battiston, who played a one-two with Giresse then sped forward, fresh legs devouring ground, before blasting a left-footed shot narrowly wide.</p> <p>The most striking impression, watching the match at a distance of more than 25 years, is of a less disciplined yet more intelligent game than is played today. Every outfield player appears to have had greater autonomy. Both teams passed and moved with thoughtful fluidity; they bristled with intelligent purpose.</p> <p>West Germany continued their pressing game. Midfielder Magath was like a little eel, slipping into pockets of space. Breitner played his sharp passes, probing for a way through the ribs of the French defence. But the defence stood firm. </p> <p>France began to take the upper hand. A Platini free-kick 10 yards outside the West German area cannoned off the wall. Giresse floated a lovely pass from just inside his own half, out on the left. On the edge of the penalty area, Rocheteau seemed to judge the flight of the ball better than Berndt F\u00f6rster: it drifted beyond the German, bounced once, and Rocheteau scuffed it past the onrushing Schumacher. But the referee had blown, deciding Rocheteau had impeded F\u00f6rster.</p> <p>Then Platini cut in from the left, dribbling past Kaltz across the face of the area, feinting past Uli Stielike, but shooting wide. The ball was swallowed by the sea of French fans. Many waved tricolores, while close-ups showed others with cymbals, trumpets, hooters. They were having a good time. Schumacher stood glaring, waiting for the ball to come back, but it was held on to, less by an individual, it seemed, than by the crowd as a whole. When, eventually, a Fifa technician gave Schumacher a fresh ball, he mimicked hurling it at the French fans, before taking the goal-kick. Had we just seen a humorous gesture - 'Would you like this ball too?' - or was it mockingly aggressive? After some seconds of surprised silence, boos began to be heard.</p> <p>Barely a minute later came the incident that has acquired such notoriety. Bossis won the ball with a superb tackle on Dremmler, and passed to Tigana, who laid it inside to Platini. With a momentary glance Platini appraised the scene before him, saw Battiston charging forward and floated the ball into the air. </p> <p>The pass had just the height, pace and backspin to take it beyond Karl-Heinz F\u00f6rster, to a spot where Battiston would reach it before the sweeper Uli Stielike, coming from the left, or Harald Schumacher charging out. </p> <p>Battiston got to the ball first and kicked it over the oncoming keeper's head. Everyone's gaze followed the ball, which bounced narrowly wide of goal, so people only glimpsed that Schumacher had made contact with Battiston. Watching replays, it was clear what had happened. As the German journalist Ulrich Hesse-Lichtenberger puts it: 'Just prior to crashing into Battiston he [Schumacher] did a little jump and turned his upper body in order to ease the impact. Ease it for himself, that is, as the helpless Battiston was hit in the face by Schumacher's hipbone with full force, immediately going down unconscious.'</p> <p>France players - and the West Germany captain, Kaltz - surrounded the stricken man and began waving for help. The French physio and doctor ran on, and immediately called for a stretcher. By grim chance the Seville police had, for some unknown reason, barred Red Cross officials from the sidelines. It took three minutes for a stretcher to appear, lifted up from some basement store beneath the stands. Eventually uniformed men with Red Cross armbands trotted on.</p> <p>Schumacher, meanwhile stood, impassively at the edge of his six-yard box, ball under one arm, the other hand on his hip. According to Hesse-Lichtenberger: 'His body language said: \"Get the guy off the pitch so that I can take my goal-kick.\"'</p> <p>Giresse and Janvion came to the touchline to tell their manager, Michel Hidalgo, what had happened to Battiston, and to work out how to rearrange the team, only for a Fifa official to step between them, since coaches were forbidden from discussing tactics with their players during the match. Hidalgo, furious, grumbled back to the dug-out. </p> <p>One might have thought the captain would have been the one to confer with the manager. But not this one. Platini later said that he thought his team-mate was dead. 'He had no pulse. He looked so pale.' Finally Battiston was carried off, accompanied on one side by a medic, on the other by Platini, who walked along bent towards Battiston's ashen face. The unconscious player's right arm flopped over the side of the stretcher, and Platini took Battiston's hand. He spoke softly to him as he walked. As they neared the edge of the pitch, Platini raised Battiston's hand and kissed it. </p> <p>Battiston lost two teeth, had three cracked ribs and damaged vertebrae, and was unconscious for almost half an hour. But now that he was off the pitch, play restarted, with indeed a goal-kick for West Germany, and no word of reprimand for Schumacher. </p> <p>A new substitute, Christian Lopez, came on for France and play got going. It appeared that if anything West Germany had been chastened by the incident, while France were hunting the ball. A purposeful fury seemed to burn through the team. Once, when the ball ran loose out on the left, Tr\u00e9sor chased after it and took off for a tackle like a long-jumper, a murderous, studs-up lunge from which Kaltz wisely stepped aside. While the referee reproved Tr\u00e9sor, Platini walked behind and ruffled his hair in blatant approval.</p> <p>The atmosphere crackled, with a feeling less of a sporting occasion than of some \u00e9v\u00e9nement, as if the players and the crowd were not in a sporting arena but all out on the street, and anything could happen.</p> <p>France attacked with further swift interchanges. But they could not score and now West Germany, midway through the half, began to stir again. Hans-Peter Briegel galvanised his team with one of his powerful runs out of defence. Magath almost got through on the left. Dremmler shot from the right, Ettori getting down well to hold on to the ball.</p> <p>After 72 minutes little Magath was replaced by his Hamburg club-mate, blond giant Horst Hrubesch, known as Das Kopfball-Ungeheuer, the Heading Beast. Hrubesch was just about as big as Briegel, who was 'a human Panzer division in himself', according to Brian Glanville. Kaltz, Schumacher, the F\u00f6rster brothers, too, could easily be imagined playing starring roles in some war film. It was hard not to notice the marked contrast to the multiracial French. Tr\u00e9sor had been born in Guadeloupe, Janvion in Martinique, Tigana in Mali, Lopez in Algeria. Platini, Amoros, Genghini were the children or grandchildren of immigrants. At the 1998 World Cup, Platini would not be alone in his opinion that 'the people who talk about a black, white and beur [North African] France were 30 years late. France has been black, white and beur for a long time. I was shocked by this discussion in '98. These people do not look around themselves very much.'</p> <p>By now, all four full-backs were wonderfully adventurous - Kaltz whipping in his bananenflanken, Bossis roaming forward - and they ended up more often tackling each other, overlapping, than the putative attackers. Didier Six, well placed on the six-yard line, shot tamely straight at Schumacher. At the other end, Breitner fed Briegel, who evaded Bossis's tackle and shot against the spread-eagled Ettori. The game was once more open, swaying one way then another. West German attacks were direct, pragmatic, incisive. The French either counter-attacked at thrilling speed or else slowed the tempo, worked their way slyly forwards. The better France played, the easier they made it look, trading the ball between each other, the West Germans apparently unwilling to intercept.</p> <p>With less than five minutes left, Tigana picked the ball up in his own half and surged down the right past first Breitner, then Briegel, and sent a marvellous cross hanging perfectly to the far post, where in the absence of a defender Rocheteau managed to get in Six's way, depriving the winger of a clear heading opportunity. The last chance of the 90 minutes, surely. </p> <p>But no. France once more gained possession. Platini laid the ball into the path of Amoros with a 20-yard gap in front of him. Amoros drove forward and from 35 yards out let fly a missile of a shot. Schumacher dived in vain, the ball flew over him, dipping, and on 90 minutes and 02 seconds hit the underside of the bar... and bounced out.</p> <p>There was, necessarily, a good deal of injury time to be added, in the third minute of which Tigana lost possession to Breitner, outside the left of the France penalty area. Breitner shot towards the far post. Ettori dived to his left but fumbled the ball: it dribbled away from him and, as he scuttled after it, Klaus Fischer bore down like a bird of prey. Denied a chance all night by Janvion, he was suddenly presented with this morsel. It was a race between the tips of Ettori's gloves and the toe of Fischer's right boot, which the Frenchman just, bravely, won, poking the ball away for a corner.</p> <p><strong>One-all, at full-time.</strong></p> <p>Now the managers could talk to their players, who collapsed on the grass. Trainers, physios, subs came on to pass round water, massage the muscles of tired legs. </p> <p>Those of us watching then - as now, so many years later - knew that we were witnessing something extraordinary, but few could have imagined how much more these players were to give us. In the third minute of extra time, Briegel obstructed Platini out on the right, and now something inexplicable happened. The penalty area was packed. As Giresse shaped to dispatch the free-kick, France players began to move, to dart this way and that, their markers shadowed them, and at the moment Giresse's cross arrived the middle of the penalty area was suddenly empty. Except for the French sweeper, Marius Tr\u00e9sor, who stood all alone just in front of the penalty spot. With perfect, joyful technique, he walloped the volley into the net.</p> <p><strong>Two-one.</strong></p> <p>The French celebrated and when play resumed there was something hectic about their movement. They dashed helter-skelter. It appears, watching the match again, as if they were intoxicated with a sense of justice. A wrong had been done, and was being put right, and the more they attacked so the more justice would be served. They broke forward again, Tigana shooting wide. </p> <p>Jupp Derwall brought his injured but totemic captain, current European Footballer of the Year Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, off the bench in place of Briegel, and the substitution jolted the Germans: a shock of effort rippled through the team, sending them pulsing forward, without threatening the French goal. On the contrary. In his own half, Giresse tapped a simple free-kick up the right to Rocheteau, who advanced and squared the ball to Platini on the front edge of the penalty area. Faced with three defenders ahead of him, Platini sent the ball on across to Six on the left. Six controlled the ball and then, in his most positive contribution of the match, caressed the ball from one foot to another while others moved around him: Platini went forward then suddenly out to the right, dragging defenders with him as if magnetised. Into space in the middle came Alain Giresse, and now Six laid the ball off gently, invitingly, into his path. Giresse met the ball with the outside of his right foot, giving it a flight path that curved outside Schumacher's dive and then inside towards the goal, glancing in off the right-hand post.</p> <p><strong>Three-one, in extra-time.</strong></p> <p>France did not sit on their lead, by playing square passes simply to keep possession. They wanted to score a fourth, and surged forward. Six was fouled, another Platini free-kick. This one ripped through the wall and cannoned back off Schumacher's chest.</p> <p>'Germany are dissolving,' the commentator Martin Tyler said. 'I can't remember ever saying that about a German side.' Giresse, Rocheteau, the marauding Bossis, Tigana and Platini attacked all together down the right. Six was in the middle ahead of them. This was how these musketeers would protect their lead: attack in numbers. Giresse was fouled and lay in pain. Rocheteau stopped playing to attend to his comrade, but the French retained possession and the referee waved play on. A moment later Platini was bundled off the ball: no free-kick was given and suddenly the French had lost possession with half their team stranded high upfield. Rummenigge and Littbarski combined on the vacant left, Stielike joined in, the sweeper at last making an advanced contribution with a fine pass out to Littbarski, who floated the ball forward into space at the near post between the France defence and the goalkeeper. Janvion and Rummenigge ran forward, Ettori rushed out, all three lunged but the West German got there first, and with a deft, incisive flick sent the ball past Ettori and fractionally inside the near post.</p> <p><strong>Three-two after 103 minutes. </strong></p> <p>Into the second period of extra time and, if there was a lesson to be learnt, France showed no sign of having learnt it. They seemed incapable of common sense or caution: compelled to win with swashbuckling style, they recalled the writer Andr\u00e9 Breton's dictum that 'beauty shall be convulsive, or not at all'. But all this emotion was exhausting. Tigana would keep running all night and Rocheteau remained a courageous, willing target man. Tr\u00e9sor was a towering figure at the heart of the defence. But all around them, one by one, French players were coming to a standstill.</p> <p>West Germany advanced down the left, Littbarski crossed, Hrubesch headed back from the far post into the middle. Klaus Fischer had been dominated throughout by Bernard Janvion. But a top-class striker has to be obtuse, undismayed by all that has gone before, eternally alert to that one opportunity. There were two defenders plus the goalkeeper on the line, but Fischer met Hrubesch's lay-off with a brilliantly executed bicycle kick into the top corner. </p> <p><strong>Three-three after 108 minutes. </strong></p> <p>Janvion was limping. Platini was drained. But still the game remained open. Like two blind, exhausted fighters the teams kept going. From a West German corner Fischer knocked the ball back into the danger area. Tr\u00e9sor leapt to head clear and the ball was worked up to Six, who played it out to space on the right into which Tigana - clearly in pain still from an earlier collision - struggled: he reached the ball before Stielike and shot, well wide. It was the last significant action of the game. Moments later Corver blew his whistle.</p> <p>'So, abominably, irrationally and unforgivably,' as Brian Glanville wrote, 'a World Cup semi-final would be decided, for the first time, on penalties.'</p> <p>Giresse, Kaltz, Amoros, Breitner and Rocheteau all scored. Uli Stielike shot weakly, Ettori easily saved. Stielike collapsed, curled up on the ground. Eventually, as if his body had doubled in weight, he dragged himself up and stumbled back towards his colleagues in the centre, bent head in hands, weeping. Littbarski came to meet him, and escorted him back, arm around the older man's shoulders.</p> <p>But then Didier Six shot softly to Schumacher's right, for an easy save, and Littbarski evened things up at 3-3.</p> <p>Platini and Rummenigge scored. Next up came Maxime Bossis. An exact contemporary of Platini - the two born just five days apart in June 1955 - they had done their military service together in the Joinville battalion, and their 10-year international careers ran in tandem. If Platini embodied the art of this team, Bossis encapsulated its spirit, and was prime candidate for man of the match. He struck his penalty to Schumacher's right, and watched as the goalkeeper dived the same way: although the shot was a half-decent one, the save was easy enough. </p> <p>Horst Hrubesch now lumbered up, and shot low and hard for the winning penalty. West Germany were through to the final.</p> <p>As Jupp Derwall asserted afterwards: 'You must give my players the credit they deserve, they showed such strength of character.' And so they had. 'The taste, however,' according to Brian Glanville, 'was exceedingly sour. Michel Hidalgo, by nature quiet and moderate, condemned Corver's flaccid refereeing. \"We have been eliminated brutally,\" he insisted.' Even in a recent interview, the wound for Hidalgo was still fresh. 'People witnessed a great injustice. The match reignited the Franco-German antagonism that had faded.'</p> <p>When Schumacher was told after the match that Battiston had lost two teeth, he said: 'If that's all that's wrong, tell him I'll pay for the crowns.' In a post-World Cup poll in a newspaper for the least popular person among the French, Schumacher shaded Adolf Hitler into second place. </p> <p>In the final Italy, to universal approval, won 3-1. According to Ulrich Hesse-Lichtenberger: 'The [West Germany] side returned home expecting to be hailed as the second best team in the world. Instead, the squad was met with frosty silence, if not outright disgust.'</p> <p>Two years later, on home soil, in the 1984 European Championship, France would pursue the destiny of which they had been robbed. Genghini's place in midfield was taken by Luis Fernandez, who ate up the ground and won the ball for the three artists around him, in a quartet that was given the sobriquet Le Carr\u00e9 Magique, the Magic Square. </p> <p>Playing with both panache and conviction, France won the tournament; Platini was the outstanding star, scoring from midfield nine of his side's 15 goals. Yet such is his insight into the meaning of sport, that no memory equals that torrid night in Seville, when he was on the losing side, but in every significant way emerged a winner.</p> <h2>Where are they now?</h2> <p><strong>France</strong></p> <p><strong>Patrick Battiston</strong></p> <p>Despite losing two teeth and suffering vertebra damage in the Schumacher challenge, Battiston doesn't bear a grudge: 'I feel no hate,' he said in July. The defender retired in 1991 after a second spell at Bordeaux and is now coach of that club's reserves.</p> <p><strong>Didier Six</strong></p> <p>The winger became a French pioneer in English football when he joined Aston Villa in 1984. He now runs a summer soccer camp in Metz, but wants a pro coaching job - in 2007 he complained that getting into management in France was like joining the mafia. </p> <p><strong>Marius Tresor</strong></p> <p>The scorer of France's second extra-time goal, Platini's predecessor as captain was named one of the 125 greatest players of all time by Pel\u00e9 in 2004. He finished his playing career at Bordeaux in 1984, and is now a director and assistant coach at the club. </p> <p><strong>West Germany</strong></p> <p><strong>Harald Schumacher</strong></p> <p>Nicknamed Toni, his international career was ended by allegations of substance abuse he made in a 1987 book. Schumacher now owns and runs SportsFirst, a consultancy agency with Bundesliga club Schalke 04 and the German FA on its books.</p> <p><strong>Karl-Heinz Rummenigge</strong></p> <p>The striker retired in 1989 before returning to his first club, Bayern Munich, as an executive in 1991. He became the club's chairman in 2002 and has since also become chairman of the European Club Association, the larger successor to the G-14 lobby group.</p> <p><strong>Pierre Littbarski</strong></p> <p>Scorer of West Germany's glorious opener, Littbarski ended his playing career in Japan in 1997. He has since become a well travelled manager in the J-League, Germany, Australia and Iran. He left struggling Iranian Premier League team Saipa in October.</p>",
  "<p>I am only a few hours into my two-day maiden sail across the Channel when the first crisis comes. My skipper, Sam Davies, emerges from the cabin with a stricken look. She has forgotten a crucial part of equipment - a spare gas canister. We will have to survive the rest of the voyage to France without another cup of tea. </p> <p>It is a tough break. But I am, after all, here to experience some of the hardships Sam will soon be facing on the high seas. Next month, she is one of 30 solo sailors embarking on the Vend\u00e9e Globe, the non-stop round-the-world race that is sailing's ultimate endurance event. For three months, she will be living and racing aboard her 60ft yacht, Roxy, without aid, company, or fresh food. I had best not grumble about needing my morning cuppa. </p> <p>Since we left Southampton, we have enjoyed what Sam calls 'dream sailing'. Conditions could not be better. The wind is up, the waves are not, and I'm sitting in a surprisingly warming sun, sipping fruit juice and watching the boat steer itself towards France. Its tillers, one each side at the stern, twitch back and forth like Dalek proboscises. 'I hardly ever drive,' Sam says. 'The autopilot drives better than me. In a straight line, anyway.'</p> <p>This is not how it was meant to go. I am supposed to be battling through driving rain, trying to haul rope through frozen fingers, ready to commit my tearful monologue to video. But from the moment that I set eyes on this shocking-pink boat, nothing is quite as I expect. I am confounded by its dimensions: the 20ft mast and the mighty sails, which seem far too large for a single person to handle. Then comes the impossibly tiny cabin, which comprises little more than a chart-table and a laptop, yet somehow contains everything you need for three months at sea. </p> <p>Nor is 33-year-old Sam the intense, melancholy figure I expect of someone who spends so long alone on the water. Just the opposite; she is laid-back and chatty, and seems to get a thrill from everything that happens on the water, breaking off midsentence to exclaim that we're doing 18 knots, or to show off 'a new toy'. Dour and weatherbeaten she is not. 'Some people, like Ellen [MacArthur],' she says, 'sail better when they're miserable. I'm the opposite. I sail better when I'm enjoying it, when I'm smiling.' </p> <p>Sam smiles a lot. She's smiling as she lists the various dangers of which I need to be aware: trapping a finger in a winch, slicing my hand on a rope, getting in the way of the boom 'which is called that because that's the noise it makes when it hits your head'. Not to mention the perils of using the toilet. This entails climbing through the dark to reach a bucket in the stern, then gingerly rinsing it out in the boat's wake. 'Just remember we're moving pretty fast. If you get tugged out of the boat, it's a pain in the bum to come and rescue you.' </p> <p>I ask Sam if she has ever been left in the water. 'No, and I never want to be.' A week ago she had a frightening reminder of how merciless the sea can be: a friend of hers was thrown out of his boat mid-race and was in the waves, in the middle of the night, for two hours before he was found, happily, alive. </p> <p>Lithe and limber, Sam swings herself through hatches with Dukes of Hazzard panache, immune to the boat's unpredictable movements. Before this trip, I met one of her old schoolfriends; she said that when she thinks of Sam sailing, balancing the various forces on the boat with her levers, ropes and winches, she pictures a mouse running around on top of a bomb. </p> <p>I stumble around in my heavy-duty wellies, my legs like lead weights. I have to pick them up to contort myself through the various portholes. Sam gets me working on the 'coffee grinder' - the large pedestal in the middle of the cockpit with dual handles for turning the winches. I roll my shoulders into the effort; it is rather pleasing to see the sails rise through my own arm power.</p> <p>Supper comes in a shiny metallic bag marked MX3 that claims to contain a paella. It takes two sets of pliers and a Leatherman before we break into the vacuum packaging. We rehydrate the freeze-dried food in the last of our hot water and eat it straight out of the bag. It's a bit soggy, but identifiable as rice, and it tastes surprisingly good. Another bag contains pudding: 'vanilla creme dessert'. We don't stint on the jaffa cakes, either. 'You can never eat enough when you're sailing,' Sam tells me. 'I'm always having to persuade myself to eat more.'</p> <p>When darkness falls, we are about to cross two of the busiest shipping lanes on the Channel. The lights of four or five ships, probably 10 times our size, are bearing down from different directions, and we're still moving along at a lick. As we prepare to pass the first, we roll in one of the sails to slacken our speed. There is no difference between sailing at night and day, except the use of a head torch. In a race, you can't afford to lose any time sleeping. </p> <p>'You can get by for 10 to 12 days on 15-minute catnaps,' Sam says casually. The longest she can allow herself to sleep is two hours, and only when she needs 'a really good rest'. It was this that made her most nervous about attempting solo racing. 'I've always been a big sleeper - 10 hours a night on land - and I didn't know if I'd be able to stay awake. But it's amazing what your body can do.' </p> <p>She also takes advice from doctors and academics who research sleep. She has learnt about 'a stupid brain and a sensible brain': the stupid brain is capable of doing various automatic activities while your sensible brain is asleep. 'If I've just woken up, I have to analyse myself and think, \"Which brain is awake? Is this a good time to make a decision?\" because otherwise I make mistakes.' It's something I ponder when, woken from my own two-hour nap, I spend 10 minutes working out how to get out of the bunk.</p> <p>When the sun comes up, we are in sight of the French coast. The wind keeps ebbing and shifting, which requires us to tack and gybe - moving the sails from side to side to catch it as it changes direction. But after a night of two-hour naps, I'm groggy and clumsy. With the boat at a permanent 45-degree angle, I struggle to stand up while Sam runs around doing all the work. She tells me that at the gym she specialises in balance work - pilates, core-strengthening, wobble boards. I feel marginally better, if no more stable.</p> <p>Our destination is Brittany, where Sam lives with her boyfriend, Romain, and their two cats. Sam and Romain train from the same base, Port La For\u00eat, with the renowned 'Pole France' racing squad, and until last year they competed against each other in the Figaro class. Sam enjoyed that, but Romain did not. 'He was stressed if I was in front of him, because he didn't want to be beaten by his girlfriend, and if I was behind him, he was worried about what was wrong. So he was sailing badly.' Things were even tougher when Roxy, the women's clothing company, offered to sponsor Sam to race in the Vend\u00e9e Globe. 'It had always been his dream,' she says, 'and he didn't like the fact his girlfriend was going to do it before him. We nearly split up.' </p> <p>The boat with which Roxy has provided her has serious pedigree. It won the past two editions of the race, in 2000 and 2004, with Michel Desjoyeaux and Vincent Riou, respectively (it was then known as PRB, and was not as joyously coloured). At eight years old, however, Roxy is unlikely to be able to compete with the newest boats in the race - Sam's ambition is to be the fastest of the 'old guard'. In the Vend\u00e9e Globe, finishing the race is considered almost as great an achievement as winning it, and her career so far suggests she could do a good deal more. </p> <p>Sam's grandfather was a submarine commander, and she grew up in Hayling Island, Hampshire, with parents who loved being on the water. It was Sam's birth that prompted them to swap their small motorboat, considered too dangerous for a newborn, for something with sails. But although Sam spent most of her weekends sailing, her competitive instinct was pursued in the water, not on it. She was a talented synchronised swimmer and only when she missed out on a place in the national team did she take up racing.</p> <p>Her sailing career was shaped by two of the most famous British female yachtswomen of all time. At only 23, Sam was part of Tracy Edwards's all-female crew competing for the Jules Verne trophy for the fastest round-the-world circumnavigation. (It ended in dismay when their mast broke in the South Pacific - it took 16 days to reach land.) And it was encountering Ellen MacArthur - when the dame-to-be was living in a boat shed in Hamble - that inspired Sam to try her hand at solo sailing. Her first race, in 2001, was the Mini-Transat, a transatlantic race in 21ft vessels that look more like bathtubs than boats. </p> <p>She has established herself as one of the world's best offshore sailors in gruelling ocean races all over the world. But none can compare to the epic nature of the Vend\u00e9e Globe. During the 23,680-mile race, she must round all three of the great Capes, ride the 40ft waves of the Southern Ocean and face the deadly midwinter storms of the North Atlantic. Oh, and avoid icebergs, too. 'I had always thought this race was for crazy people,' she admits. 'You have to commit to it for the previous two years, without knowing if you'll enjoy it. I know one guy who did it - he was a brave sailor, and better than me - and the race got to him. He was afraid for the whole two years.' </p> <p>It seems strange, considering Sam's sociable nature, that the loneliness doesn't worry her. But she adores being alone with her boat. It's only race starts, she says, that throw her. 'You go from being the centre of attention to the most alone you've ever been. It freaks you out for a couple of days, you're full of adrenaline, confused, you can't eat or sleep.' This time, she knows, will be worse than ever. 'I've been watching video footage of the last start day, four years ago. There's this look in the sailors' faces that you've never seen before - really excited, but sad too. As someone who doesn't normally get emotional, that makes me nervous.'</p> <p>By lunchtime, we have reached Brest, on the north-west corner of France, and turn south-east along the coast of Brittany. We are now heading upwind and against the tide, and it is hard going. Sam hands me the tiller. Staying on course is easy when there is something on the horizon to aim at; it's when there isn't that it's a problem. A pair of ribbons on the mainsail tell me if I am catching the wind and I have to keep an eye on them while maintaining our compass bearing and monitoring our speed. It is fiendish and within moments we are down to a paltry eight knots. At this rate we will be home for Christmas.</p> <p>Of course, in a three-month solo race a girl needs to be able to do far more than handle a boat. As well as being an expert in meteorology, engineering, mechanics and race strategy, to name a few, you need the resourcefulness to fix any and every problem you encounter. It's like a never-ending episode of The Krypton Factor. On one recent trip, when Sam's autopilot broke in the middle of the night and threatened to crash the boat, she fixed it by the light of a headtorch with bits and pieces stolen from elsewhere on the boat, earning her the nickname MacGyver from her shore crew. With rescue never guaranteed, she needs to be able to fix herself, too, should the worst happen. Last weekend, she was practising medical stitches on pigs' trotters.</p> <p>It strikes me, as we heave a couple of hundred kilograms of canvas on to the deck, that physical strength must give men a head start in this sport. Sam may be on an impressive weights regime, but surely guys can haul rope faster? 'Oddly, it can be an advantage for me,' she says. 'because I'm more aware of what I can't do. I'll be a little more conservative - so, for instance, I'll take down my sails before I run into trouble. Guys are more aggressive, they just want to get out there and win the thing, but women are good at pacing ourselves, holding something back for later.'</p> <p>Sam's only female rival, Dee Caffari, has told me that there are men competing in the Vend\u00e9e Globe who are afraid of Sam 'because she's worked and sailed with a French team, and because she always finishes a race. You're dealing with some big egos and they don't want to lose to a girl.' Particularly a girl in a bright pink boat.</p> <p>I do wonder, as I stand in my two-day-old clothes, face caked with salt and my hair taking on the texture of rush matting, how Sam manages to stay so coolly feminine. Rationed to three litres of fresh water a day, she takes 'bucket showers' with seawater and washing her hair is a luxury (but a great morale boost). She once got in trouble with her sponsors for admitting to a journalist that when you are sailing through the sweltering tropics, miles from the nearest human being, even clothes are not strictly a necessity.</p> <p>The sun sets behind us, sending pink and orange reflections across the water. As if they have been waiting for their moment, a pod of dolphins arrives starboard-side and starts bow-riding with the boat. We are a few miles from home and will not arrive until dark, but it is still a perfect end to the day. 'Sometimes when you're racing you don't stop working for days,' Sam says. 'But there are always times, like today, when everything is absolutely serene.'</p> <p>The Vend\u00e9e Globe starts on 9 November. You can follow Sam's progress at <a href=\"http://www.samdavies.com\">www.samdavies.com</a></p> <h2>Going it alone</h2> <p>Of the 30 sailors starting the Vend\u00e9e Globe, seven are British. Dee Caffari, the only other female competitor, has already sailed the 'wrong' way round the world in her boat Aviva. The frosty rivalry between 34-year-old Alex Thomson, in Hugo Boss, and Mike Golding, 48, in Ecover, thawed after a race in 2006, when Golding turned back to rescue Thomson after his boat capsized. Golding, who came third in 2004, is a race favourite, but it is another Brit, Brian Thompson, whose yacht Pindar has been described by former winner Michel Desjoyeaux as 'the fastest boat out there'. S\u00e9bastien Josse, the only person to have completed all three of the Jules Verne Trophy, Volvo Ocean Race and Vend\u00e9e Globe, is the strongest of the 19 French contenders.</p>",
  "<p>Federal reserve chairman Ben Bernanke is poised to slash American interest rates to just 1 per cent this week, the lowest level since the depths of the dotcom crash, as government figures reveal the US has joined Britain on the cusp of recession.</p> <p>World investors were focused on Britain last week after Bank of England governor Mervyn King and Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirmed recession was looming, and it emerged that the economy had shrunk by a worse-than-expected 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of the year. But all eyes will now turn to the US, as the Fed meets to set borrowing costs and government figures reveal the full scale of the deterioration in the economy over the past three months.</p> <p>The White House bought a short-lived economic boost in the second quarter of 2008 by sending out $150bn in tax rebate cheques to voters and businesses. But the money was quickly spent, and analysts believe the economy then declined rapidly even before the global financial system was pushed to the brink by the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy last month.</p> <p>Robert DiClemente of Citigroup predicted that the Fed would take 'bold action' in the face of 'rapidly accumulating signs that recession was intensifying before the latest shockwave'.</p> <p>The Fed joined in with the internationally co-ordinated half-point rate cut earlier this month, taking borrowing costs to 1.5 per cent, but is nevertheless widely expected to deliver another reduction on Wednesday.</p> <p>Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at consultancy Capital Economics, warned that GDP now looked likely to contract continuously until at least late 2009. 'Everyone's coming to the realisation that the impact on the real economy is going to be pretty hard and pretty heavy,' he said.</p> <p>Bernanke has been handed more room to manoeuvre by the sharp decline in oil prices since the summer. Despite a decision by Opec ministers to cut production by 1.5 million barrels a day last week, the cost of crude continued to fall, dropping by 5 per cent on Friday alone. Brent crude closed at below $62 a barrel.</p> <p>Wall Street suffered another nerve-shredding week, as investors fretted that the spreading worldwide slowdown would hit companies far beyond the banking sector. The Dow Jones closed down 312 points on Friday night.</p> <p>Puneet Sharma, head of European strategy at Barclays Capital, said: 'Emerging market economies are in retreat; Western multinationals, which have enjoyed strong earnings as a consequence of their exuberance, will be adversely affected in the months ahead. It is finally getting through to people.'</p> <p>Aerospace, engineering, chemicals, automotive and luxury goods firms now appear likely to be hit in a way that shareholders thought inconceivable even a couple of months ago, when the prevailing belief was that fast-growing countries such as China and India would cushion the world from recession.</p> <p>'What's going on in the stock markets is a reflection of the fact that investors are realising non-financial profits are going to be absolutely whacked,' said Ashworth.</p>",
  "<p>Sitting at a table in an antique-filled dining room in the New Forest, I'm trying to identify a series of objects laid out before me. On one plate sits what looks like a dried human liver. It's big and red, but underneath it's the pale colour of naan bread.</p> <p>'When it's really fresh there's jelly on top and it seems to drip blood if you cut into it,' says Jackie, my host.</p> <p>This is a beefsteak mushroom, she reveals, very popular with London chefs and delicious when thinly sliced and fried with garlic. The large, fluffy-looking ball turns out to be a Chicken of the Woods - which does indeed have a headless hen-like appearance - and then there's a plate of more mushroomy-shaped mushrooms, 'spongy underneath' boletes and dimpled chanterelles. </p> <p>I'm on a seminar at Gorse Meadow Guest House near Lymington with 10 other fungi fans, delving into the fascinating world of mushrooms. There are, I learn, around 3,000 types in the New Forest alone, but we're only interested in identifying about 10 edible varieties. </p> <p>Passing around pictures, we discover that different mushrooms like particular forests or specific trees (oysters favour beech; beefsteaks prefer oak) and learn when and how quickly they grow, and, most importantly, what not to eat (around 10 per cent of mushrooms are poisonous). Although it's a very rare occurence, a woman from the Isle of Wight died in September after eating a death cap and Nicholas Evans, author of the Horse Whisperer, recently needed dialysis after munching wild mushrooms in Scotland. Follow simple rules, says Jackie: 'Avoid anything with white gills and anything that's red underneath. If in doubt, leave it alone, and always cook them well.'</p> <p>Gorse Meadow is the home of Mrs Tee's Wild Mushrooms, a business selling wild and cultivated mushrooms owned by German-born Brigitte Tee-Hillman, a leading authority on the subject and the only person to have a licence to pick wild fungi in the New Forest for commercial sale. As well as supplying restaurants, hotels, shops and individuals with fresh and dried mushrooms from the UK and abroad (nine of the 28 Michelin-starred restaurants in the London area, from Le Gavroche to Nobu, are customers), Mrs Tee runs seminars throughout the year. Even chefs from Buckingham Palace have attended to gen up for the royal kitchen.</p> <p>Most volume and variety is found in October and November, but the season starts in April, when the little white St George's mushroom makes its first appearance, and lasts until December. You're likely to find oyster mushrooms in June or July, beefsteak from August, and pieds de mouton or hedgehogs from September - but there's no guarantee and each year is different.</p> <p>While Jackie takes the seminar, Mrs Tee is up to her elbows in mushrooms in the kitchen, preparing our lunch - a wild mushroom-packed omelette and a risotto. Her passion for mushrooms began as a child in southern Germany during the Second World War when she would go picking with her grandmother. After marrying an Englishman and settling in the New Forest in the Seventies, she began mushrooming again, taking her haul to London by train to sell.</p> <p>When the Forestry Commission tried to stop her picking more than the permitted 1.5kg a day in the New Forest in 2002, she was having none of it. Four years of legal battles and 32 court appearances later, she was granted the first and only licence from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, giving her the right to pick and sell wild fungi in the forest for life. 'I had the equivalent of squatter's rights really, I'd been doing it so long,' she says.</p> <p>After lunch it's time to put our newly gained knowledge to the test. We head out in convoy through the forest. Created in 1079 as a deer-hunting area by William the Conqueror, it's all golden and beautiful in the autumn sunshine. We stop at Milkham and grab bags for our finds.</p> <p>'We don't use baskets because we don't want others to know what we've got,' says Jackie. The forest's best picking hotspots are closely guarded secrets - Mrs Tee has her favourites but keeps their whereabouts firmly under wraps.</p> <p>Disappearing into the pine forest, it's not long before the first shrieks of a happy picker break the silence. We're all soon absorbed, quietly walking along, staring at the ground then pouncing with glee. Winter chanterelles blend into the autumn bracken, but spy one and suddenly a dozen more come into focus. Hedgehog mushrooms flash white at the foot of trees - the spines underneath an identifying feature. Sporadically, we run back to Jackie with our cache, like kids looking for approval. 'No that's not one you'd eat, throw it away; no that's a sulphur cap, not a cow bolete - it's not dangerous but not good to eat; yes, that's a chanterelle, you can tell by the dimple on top, very good,' she says.</p> <p>Before we head off we hand in our haul in exchange for a goody bag of mushrooms that have already been deemed safe by the experts.</p> <p>Mrs Tee has lovely rooms at Gorse Meadow for B&amp;B guests and the restaurant serves gourmet evening meals (think wild mushroom consomm\u00e9, venison with wild mushrooms), but we're staying in Oak Tree Cottage not far away in Eyeworth. Hidden at the end of a tiny lane, it's a delightful weather-boarded bungalow dating back to 1899, with three sumptuous bedrooms, each with its own bathroom, surrounded by fields full of horses. There's prime mushroom hunting woods outside the front door and lovely walks past the nearby lake.</p> <p>A 10-minute stroll from the cottage is the Royal Oak pub in Fritham, a timber-framed, thatched 17th-century gem that's been named Country Pub of the Year in The Good Pub Guide 2009. Landlady Pauline McCulloch is chasing pigs out of the garden when we arrive, and husband Neil talks us through the seven local real ales on offer. Although the Royal Oak specialises in delicious lunches using produce from local suppliers and duck smoked on the premises, it doesn't serve evening meals, so we wander back home in search of a bite.

  "<p>Lalit Modi, commissioner of cricket's multi-billion-pound <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/indianpremierleague\">Twenty20 Indian Premier League</a>, has told <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/englandcricketteam\">England</a> captain Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff and their international colleagues they are not welcome when the second competition begins in April unless they feature 'for a substantial number of games - 15 or 16 matches'. </p> <p>This will come as a serious shock to Pietersen and his team because Modi had said only on Friday that the IPL would 'love to have the English players'. </p> <p>'The critical issue for us is whether they are appealing enough for our club owners to have English players only for a few matches,' said Modi, speaking exclusively to Observer Sport. 'They must be there for substantial numbers of games or for all the matches. </p> <p>'But I don't think they will commit to playing all the matches, unless something radical happens.'</p> <p>That 'something radical' can only be a shift in the global cricket calendar, with the Twenty20 game being given more prominence at the expense of some Test series. Sean Morris, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers Association, said Modi was using Pietersen and Flintoff as 'pawns and bargaining chips' in a global power struggle between India and England, a view also held by the England and Wales Cricket Board.</p> <p>'Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff are keen to play in the IPL, so they'll not be very happy with this news,' said Morris. 'But they're pawns in a game of international politics between the two boards. Everyone says you need to create an official window in the international cricket calendar to let the IPL happen. What I'm seeing is the manipulation of Test teams.'</p> <p>Sri Lanka are unable to tour England early next summer because their best players have IPL contracts, and Morris said: 'If Modi has not been given a window, he'll create one through different means. It's probably cheaper this way - having to sign up, say, ten players rather than do global deals with the other boards. Modi's a clever guy, he's got all the levers and he's decided to go down the strategy of a forcing a window by using the players.'</p> <p>The ECB are in 'continuing discussions with the Indian board about Twenty20 cricket and the length of the window', a spokesman said last night. England players could be released next year to play in the IPL - which takes place between 10 April and 29 May - but would have to return home after a few games. England's Test series is due to start in early May, against whoever replaces Sri Lanka. West Indies are favourites, but Morris is unsure if there will be any credible opposition for England by then. </p> <p>'Chris Gayle [West Indies captain] is getting $900,000 to play in the IPL, so what do you think is going to happen there? What are the chances of him coming to play for West Indies in England? It's not going to happen. Who, actually, will be available for England to play? Go through the teams. Scotland or Ireland? There's no one else left.'</p> <p>Despite Morris's claims, the ECB are confident West Indies will make the trip, and they could also consider inviting Pakistan, though their top players, too, would have commitments to Twenty20 in India. The ECB are contractually bound, through their record \u00a3220m with Sky, to play international cricket in May. Defaulting would force repayment of some of that money.</p> <p>Modi's comments signify the latest escalation in hostilities between the boards of India and England, which started with the IPL's inception last year. Pietersen and his team-mates were unable to play in the inaugural tournament because of England's tour to New Zealand. The top players might have earned as much as \u00a3500,000 had they played in India. </p> <p>The players could be more than compensated if they win their Twenty20 match next Saturday. The ECB signed up to the staging of the winner-takes-all, $1m a-player Stanford 20/20 challenge against a West Indies XI in Antigua. The ECB have also allowed a window for England players to play in the IPL next year, however brief.</p> <p>Modi's undermining of the England authorities follows a direct attack by Kunal Dasgupta, chief executive of Sony Entertainment Television, on the ECB chairman Giles Clarke. Sony bought the IPL broadcast rights for $1bn.</p> <p>Dasgupta claimed Clarke - who brokered the Stanford match and pushed through a 20-team domestic competition for English Twenty20 - was 'a discredit to his players and cost them a lot of money' by his refusal to join the Indian, South African and Australian boards in becoming stakeholders of another new tournament, the T20 Champions League. This event begins in December and is worth $900million from TV rights alone.</p> <p>Modi added to the England players' disquiet by questioning their value in the IPL. 'Are the franchise owners happy for Kevin Pietersen to play a handful of matches and then go away? I don't think anybody would be happy with that. He wouldn't add any value and would be more of a disruption. It takes time to gel with team-mates and to become part of team strategy and implement that strategy. They need to be there for 15 or 16 matches.'</p> <p>Modi accepts that under the current international cricket calendar this would be unlikely, but hopes that changes to the ICC's Future Tours Programme will allow England's players a chance to earn big money in the IPL, 'so we can move our tournament further forward'.</p> <p>'If Pietersen and Flintoff had joined the IPL at the beginning, prior to us selling all our commercial rights, it would be a different proposition altogether,' Modi said. 'Their impact and market value would have been reflected in our broadcast rights or in the amount of sponsorship we could have sold. But we have sold those rights for ten years already. So we in the IPL do not benefit from their addition to the league. Everything has been sold.'</p> <p>For the new IPL season, each franchise can buy up to 10 foreign players, but only four are allowed on the field at any time. Modi feels that if English players were signed up only to flit in and out, the job of building individual franchise brands would become much more difficult. 'The Premier League, La Liga and the Bundesliga have foreign players who have become synonymous with particular clubs over the years. That is something we want to build.' </p> <p>Morris said: 'We're definitely concerned. I'm flying out to see Pietersen and the rest of the England boys next week to have a chat. And I'm talking to the ECB about the potential impact. </p> <p>'The reality is world cricket has all the eggs in one basket and we're not one of them. It's hurting us domestically with things like the Champions League. Because Australia and South Africa have a 30 and 20 per cent share, they'll be receiving $150m over the next ten years which they can obviously invest in their players and game. We'll be receiving a participation fee of $1.5m a year. That's because we're not a shareholder.</p> <p>'It all looks like it's getting messy.'</p>",
  "<p>In a recent interview, Daniel Craig claimed Barack Obama would make a better James Bond than John McCain. Parade magazine quotes the star of Quantum of Solace as saying: 'Obama would be willing to quite literally look the enemy in the eye and go toe to toe with them.'</p> <p>A moment's thought and I recalled where I'd recently heard someone else wanting to go 'toe to toe' with the enemy. It was the First Minister's challenge to the Prime Minister when launching the SNP election campaign in Glenrothes. Conjuring up a mental image of Alex Salmond as 007 is probably not to be advised, but it triggers the question as to whether recent events, global and local, have left the First Minister shaken or stirred.</p> <p>We can be confident that Salmond will never publicly display any sign of being troubled. But the financial and economic shockwaves of the last month have undoubtedly put him on the back foot. It wasn't his political opponents who first drew the Icelandic experience into the debate on Scotland's future. Look at the ministerial blogs posted on the website of the Scottish government's National Conversation last St Andrew's Day. </p> <p>Finance Secretary John Swinney exhorts Scotland to match Iceland's performance; Enterprise Minister Jim Mather casts his eyes to 'Iceland to the north' as part of the 'arc of prosperity' to which Scotland must aspire; even Education Secretary Fiona Hyslop says that 'we need only look to Iceland' if we wish to see employment benefits.</p> <p>In the aftermath of Iceland's banking failure, Salmond can't reasonably cry 'foul' if his opponents question the soundness of his case by pointing to the weakness of his chosen example. In any event, even before the crash thrust that country into the headlines, Iceland was experiencing inflation of more than 14 per cent, a depreciating currency and interest rates higher than 12 per cent. Was that the performance Swinney hoped an independent Scotland would match?</p> <p>Nor has the case for independence been helped by the falling oil price. At $120 per barrel, accountants Grant Thornton calculated a Scottish budget surplus of \u00a34.4bn. Running the same economic model with oil at $75 per barrel produces a deficit of \u00a3800m. Even if the balance is made more favourable by a price rise, following Opec's decision to cut production, dependency on a yo-yo oil price isn't a recipe for financial stability. In a time of financial crisis, stability isn't something to be tossed aside.</p> <p>Salmond has also looked increasingly uncomfortable as events have unfolded involving Scotland's two leading banks, especially when Gordon Brown has been receiving the plaudits for his bank rescue plan. In the aftermath of the announcement of a merger between Lloyds TSB and HBOS, the First Minister played the straight bat expected of him and sought to maximise jobs for Scotland and minimise the downside. But the straight bat isn't his stroke of choice, certainly not when he has to address the party faithful in conference and there is a crucial byelection in the offing. His default mode is to be stirred - better still, to be stirring. </p> <p>And Gordon Brown's attack on the SNP case for independence let him off the hook. He could now deliver the jibe about the 'sub-Prime Minister' - as clever as it was obvious. He could now alter his position on the merger between Lloyds TSB and HBOS, conveniently citing the changed circumstances of the UK government's rescue package.</p> <p>Into his stride, Salmond links the blame for the origins of the financial crisis with the replacement of Trident and demands \u00a31bn from Westminster to help Scotland cope with the looming economic crisis.</p> <p>So in the face of doubts and questions, Salmond deploys attack as the best form of defence. For all he has accomplished in government, he still relishes the freedom of opposition, not least when challenging Labour in its heartland. But even leaving aside the obvious change in the political and financial environment since July, Glenrothes is different from Glasgow East: the raw anger has gone; Labour now has a full-time Scottish Secretary, relishing the challenge of his appointment; Gordon Brown is a Fifer and a neighbour; and the SNP cannot play on grievances against the council.</p> <p>Unlike Glasgow East, the SNP candidate is not an opposition councillor, but the leader of SNP-led Fife council. Already, uncertainty over future funding of the SNP national policy of free school meals for all pupils in the first three years of primary school has emerged as an election issue. A number of councils claim they do not have the money to deliver the free meals from August 2010, even though the commitment is expressly set out in the agreement reached between ministers and Scotland's local authority representatives last year. This may well foreshadow a testing time ahead for the much-vaunted 'concordat'.</p> <p>Heading into the conference season last month, Glenrothes looked like a lost cause for Labour and there was every possibility the Prime Minister would go with it. But the political kaleidoscope has been shaken up. There has been a shift in expectation. It is Salmond who now 'must win'. But if, having issued his 'toe-to-toe challenge', the First Minister is tempted to cast himself in a 007 role, he might well reflect on another recent comment by Daniel Craig: that James Bond was 'still too headstrong and doesn't always make the right decisions'.</p> <p>\u2022 Lord Wallace of Tankerness is former leader of the Liberal Democrats in Scotland</p>",
  "<p>If, as seems likely, they have survived their South African motorcycling holiday, princes William and Harry should soon be enjoying their second heroes' welcome in two days. The first was scheduled by their tour operator to occur this weekend, on the last leg of their eight-day journey, with the town of Port Elizabeth required to supply 'a police cavalcade' and 'pomp and ceremony to welcome you home'. For the second, we can surely count on the BBC, which has repeatedly expressed keen appreciation of the skill and valour this holiday will have demanded from William and Harry.</p> <p>Or 'the young princes' as its royal correspondent Peter Hunt poignantly calls them, as if they will soon be confined, once again, to a shared chamber in a doomy Tower, their hoodies replaced with black velvet suits by Millais and their return to the shimmering veldt about as likely as a conjugal visit from Chelsy Davy.</p> <p>Amid all this idolatry, it has not always been clear what made their Enduro Africa expedition any different from, say, a long motorbike trip organised by an obscurish tour business which has now, thanks to unstinting media repetition, branded itself a global charitable endeavour. One gathers, from 'Enduro', that hardships of a noisy, mechanical nature will have been overcome, and from 'Africa', that this was the price of helping the needy. But in interviews, Enduro's lucky beneficiaries have stimulated less interest than the princes' sang-froid. Just 'how gruelling,' asked one correspondent, did they expect this journey to be?</p> <p>'Very, very gruelling,' the hulks chorused, no doubt truthfully. For a fellow Enduro Africa participant has described on his blog the terror of 'riding in total darkness in an almighty thunderstorm', adding, in an understated sort of way, 'that's a fraction of the pain we went through'.</p> <p>And yet, as the Enduro Africa website indicates, the world is full of hobbyists who would like nothing better than to experience this agony for themselves. Former travellers testify to the awesome, life-changing nature of an isolated biking holiday, accompanied by no more than around 100 like-minded white folks and a few locals to mend stuff. 'People can be very happy with very little,' concludes one traveller. Even before they had set off, one prince - it might have been the other - averred that 'there may be an opinion that we're just riding bikes, but we're not'. On the first day, they also wore tribal-style face paint.</p> <p>Interested? Then sign up, pronto, for a place on the 2009 trip, since recent stories about catastrophic climate change appear to have done little to discourage the truly idealistic biker. 'This challenge offers you the opportunity to learn about yourself and push your limits,' tantalises Enduro-whatsit. 'The aim of the rally is to raise at least \u00a3150,000 to the charities we support.' Best not to be too ambitious. But how much does it cost to follow in the exhaust fumes of the princes? Here is the splendid thing: because this holiday is also a personal challenge which benefits poor people, it need not cost the holidaymaker anything at all.</p> <p>Here's how. 'Riders will need to raise a minimum of \u00a34,995 in sponsorship,' say the organisers, requesting that this be sent to them direct. 'For each participant, we promise to donate a minimum of \u00a31,500 from your overall sponsorship target.' This year, the charities benefiting, once the business has subtracted its share, include Harry's Clarence House-based Sentebale, in aid of Aids orphans, whose first accounts were published last March. These showed that of \u00a31.15m raised for the charity, a dismal fraction - \u00a384,000 - had been distributed to the children.</p> <p>But many other longer-established charities are eager to profit from similar arrangements, from, say, Devon's Donkey Sanctuary, with its moderately gruelling three-day Spanish hike (minimum donation \u00a31,500), to Scope, the cerebral palsy charity, which is currently inviting able-bodied adventurers to sign up for a 'life-changing experience', such as its Everest expedition (\u00a33,500): 'You'll spend 13 days trekking in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Hillary...'</p> <p>Once the tourists have signed up, the charity provides advice on fundraising the full amount and, perhaps more importantly, reassurance that it is perfectly ethical to ask donors - in Scope's name - to fund life-changing experiences for people who are lucky enough not to have cerebral palsy. 'Not only are you dedicating all your spare time to fundraising the minimum sponsorship, which is a challenge in itself,' it soothes, 'you are also undertaking a difficult and intense physical challenge which will require lots of training and mental courage whilst on the trip itself.'</p> <p>Credit for the astonishingly low death rates on these adventures, which are now offered by all but the greenest charities, should probably go to the challenge organisers, usually dedicated adventure-tourism businesses which are themselves familiar with the challenge of guiding puffing tourists up and down the worn slopes of Kilimanjaro, dragging them round the ice on dogsleds or applying their blister plasters on the Great Wall of China. Indeed the choice of challenges is such that many aspiring altruists now find it simpler to approach a travel company first, pick a holiday and only then choose from a drop-down list of charities prepared to endorse their outing. Meningitis or colonic cancer? Cats or people? Cats with meningitis? Clearly, it makes fundraising sense to pick the most affecting combination.</p> <p>Once the charity has endorsed your trip, it is a simple matter to contact a local paper, promise to shave your head and set up a Justgiving page, where the rigours and privileged nature of this expedition can be shamelessly puffed up, in the manner of modern charity, and the question of its funding readily obscured. 'Every penny goes to charity x,' the trippers might say or: 'The money goes straight to y' - neglecting to point out that, in these arrangements, the travel company will routinely bill the charity for the cost of fundraisers' holidays.</p> <p>Understandably, given its popularity, some would-be fundraisers are beginning to wonder if this emphasis on adventure does not discriminate against more delicate and hedonistic vacationers. It would make no difference to Harry's Aids orphans, after all, if their money came on the back of a free wine-tasting trek round South African vineyards, a gondola safari round Venice or a paid poisoning tour of Corfu 'in the footsteps of Lord Mandelson'. The only challenge would be passing the jaunts off as altruism.</p> <p>For as much as both charities and their licensed holidaymakers insist that the ethics of free holidays are an irrelevance, considering the sums they raise for good causes, their determined misrepresentation of these trips as 'challenges' only betrays an acute sensitivity about the arrangement. Why are extreme heights, extreme dust, extreme temperatures routinely involved? So that even the participants won't realise that the trips are as polluting and as spurious as any old trek, though more morally offensive, given the routine abuse of donors' generosity. With the charities' blessing, they are persuaded to plough half their gift into tourism.</p> <p>Committed, as royals, to a lifetime's sponsorship, it was no surprise to see William and Harry balancing, in exemplary style, both their charitable commitment and the challenging, yet bonding aspects of yet another futile charity trip. 'We never get to spend any time together,' added the littler of the young princes. So tragically that, for once, you wondered what was wrong with Boujis.</p>",
  "<p>A major programme to monitor climate change from space could be in jeopardy after it emerged that the British government is poised to slash funding for the project.</p> <p>Climate scientists and campaigners have expressed deep concerns over the likely cut to the \u00a3128m promised to the Kopernikus programme, which came to light just days after the government stepped up its commitment to reducing carbon emissions.</p> <p>'The worry from the scientists is that it is essential to understand and monitor this change globally and it's not clear at this stage whether we're going to have the essential measurements to do that,' said Paul Monks, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Leicester.</p> <p>Kopernikus is the world's most ambitious environmental monitoring project. Led by the European Space Agency and funded by European member states to the tune of more than \u20ac1bn, it features satellites and a network of ground stations to monitor the effects of climate change, such as deforestation and coastal erosion. It has the specific purpose of providing accurate data for policymakers around the world. The first of the five satellites, packed with scientific instruments, Sentinel 1, is due to be sent into orbit in 2011. 'It's essential that we recognise that the Earth is changing and that we put an Earth-management plan in place. Kopernikus is that global view of a changing environment,' said Monks.</p> <p>British scientists had been led to believe that the UK would take part with a 17 per cent share of the Kopernikus project, costing \u00a3128m over five years. But at a meeting last week of the All Party Parliamentary Committee on Climate Change, it emerged that the government agencies tasked with finding the money, which include Defra, the British National Space Centre (BNSC) and the Natural and Environmental Research Council (Nerc), were having trouble finding the cash. 'There were rumours in the last week that Nerc had found \u00a320m, Defra around \u00a38m,' said Mike Healy of the satellite-manufacturing company Astrium.</p> <p>Campaigners criticised the potential shortfall, which has come as Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband increased the UK legal target to cut the greenhouse gas emissions from 60 per cent to 80 per cent by 2050.</p> <p>'There is going to be a huge need for data on deforestation, water runoff, flooding, sea-level rise, coastal erosion, large-scale fires,' said Mary Taylor, climate change campaigner at Friends of the Earth. 'Satellite data can be extremely helpful in gathering lots of good, precise data about where exactly changes are happening on the Earth's surface.'</p> <p>The shortfall for Kopernikus could also have dire implications for British climate science. 'It will have effects on our claim to be climate leaders, it'll have effects on our ability to influence the way the programme goes,' said Shaun Quegan, of the University of Sheffield and a member of the National Centre for Earth Observation.</p> <p>Monks added that Kopernikus was crucial for global efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change. 'We're moving from this state where we've been trying to understand what's going on to the state where we need to monitor the vast amounts of money we're going to spend mitigating and adapting to climate change.'</p> <p>The problems are exacerbated by the fact that the main environmental monitoring satellite already in space - Envisat - was due to go offline last year and will not be replaced until 2019. 'We're slowly going blind,' said Healy.</p> <p>Defra would not comment on the funding concerns. A spokesperson said: 'The UK government is committed to supporting this valuable environmental monitoring programme and no final funding decisions have yet been taken.'</p> <p>The final decisions on the funding for Kopernikus will be made next month, when European space ministers meet in The Hague. British scientists fear that their only option will be to appeal directly to Downing Street for the extra money.</p>",
  "<p>I thought John Prescott was bound to shout at me, if not throw punches. He has a history of bullying women journalists - he gave my colleague Rachel Cooke a hard time and once actually summoned the Times's Mary Ann Sieghart to his office so he could shout at her. Given that I recently reviewed his autobiography, Prezza, with something less than rapture, I fully expected to get the same treatment - he might conceivably have resented the description 'bog-standard illiterate bruiser'. But actually he had a great beaming smile stitched to his face almost the whole time I was with him; I found it disconcerting. Something else I found disconcerting was the habit first recorded by Rachel Cooke. When she met him, he hoiked one leg over the arm of his chair so that what she politely called his 'pelvis' was pointing at her like a gun. She said it was like a Desmond Morris seminar on mating. I assumed he did it because he fancied Rachel, but then he did exactly the same with me. He looked so uncomfortable, I wanted to say, 'There, there, you've shown us your impressive manhood - now sit up straight.'</p> <p>His office at the House of Commons is the sort of den any schoolboy would envy. One whole table is covered with model ships and planes, there is a line of model trains on the window ledge, and paintings of the cruise liners he worked on around the walls. There are also pictures of Ernest Bevin and Clem Attlee, a statuette of Nye Bevan, another of a miner - I think if you saw the room on Through the Keyhole you might guess it was Prescott's. He proudly shows me a tiny paper cup that was taken from the wreck of the Titanic - the water pressure reduced it to thimble size. He seems absolutely determined to be friendly.</p> <p>But, of course, he has something to plug, a new two-part BBC documentary called Prescott on Class. Despite the unenticing title, I loved it. What makes it great is not so much Prezza, who bangs on predictably about being working class, but Pauline, his wife, who is completely lovely and will have television producers beating a path to her door. (Prezza says a few have already tried, but she's not interested.) At one point she and Prezza go to meet a genuine toff, the Earl of Onslow, and Pauline giggles to the camera about whether it's all right to tell a Lord his flies are undone. At home in Hull, she shows us her famous downstairs loo that she was having installed just when the Tracey Temple scandal broke. Prezza got warning that the tabloids were about to run the story of his affair and dashed home to Hull to tell Pauline - she was hurt not only by his infidelity but also by the fact Tracey was someone she regarded as a friend. He said they must do a moonlight flit to Dorneywood, his ministerial retreat in Buckinghamshire, because the house would be surrounded by paparazzi in the morning. Oh no, she said, she'd got the builders coming to do her new loo, and no way would she abandon that; so she stayed at home with the builders and he went off to Dorneywood alone. Later she had a party to unveil the new loo - 'It was like Clochemerle,' says Prezza. Actually, says Pauline, it is not polite to call it a loo, or a toilet; the new posh word is 'lavatory'. Unlike Prezza, she seems to have no rancour about class, but regards it as a bit of a joke. And she reveals that actually, Prescott's family was quite posh by her standards, because they lived in a semi-detached whereas she lived in a terrace.</p> <p>Prezza's class chip is really weird - how can he keep whingeing on about being 'disadvantaged' when he was deputy prime minister for 10 years? What does he think he would have been if he'd been born into the middle class? Prime minister? King? He says it all started with him failing the 11 plus - his father promised him a bike if he passed, but then he didn't get it and it rankled. I think actually what he resents is his lack of education. He left school at 16 with no qualifications, but then became a ship's steward and organiser for the National Union of Seamen. They eventually sponsored him to go to Ruskin College, Oxford, then to Hull University. So he did get an education, but a late one. He says in his autobiography that his two years at Oxford were the happiest of his life - although he also says he worked so desperately hard he never even visited the other colleges. But perhaps Oxford gave him a vision of the sort of gilded student life he might have enjoyed if he had only passed the 11 plus. </p> <p>He hates it when people laugh about his appalling English. He was furious when Simon Hoggart compiled a whole book of Prescottisms, some of which he claims Hoggart made up, though he admits to uttering the immortal, 'The green belt is a Labour achievement and we intend to build on it.' His TV producer cunningly brought him face to face with Hoggart at the Hay Book Festival and Hoggart told him in a kindly spirit that his problem was he spoke too fast, so his words tumbled over each other. But, actually, I noticed another problem with Prescott and language. While I was with him, I thought that, though much of what he said was boring, I had no trouble understanding it. But when I came to transcribe the tape, there were whole paragraphs - nay, pages - I had to jettison as completely unintelligible. I'd understood him while he was talking, but his words made no sense on the page. So whereas I would never normally alter a quote, with Prescott I have had to carve a path through the thickets of verbiage to convey what I hope was his meaning.</p> <p>I started by saying that although I didn't like his book much, I loved his television programme. Typically, he ignored the compliment and picked up on the criticism. 'What didn't you like about the book?'</p> <p>'I thought it was pretty shallow. How long did you spend on it?' 'Well, not very long. But what did you want from the book? I'll tell you what I wanted from the book. [Typical again - he asks a question, doesn't wait for the answer.] I think I've done quite a few things in my time - not that the press have ever given me credit for it - and I wanted to put that on record, so that was quite useful. And I did have a life before politics which I wanted to put in. And it was to correct some of the image that's painted of me by the press. I assume I've confirmed some of the image, for instance, putting up two fingers outside Number 10 - people can say you shouldn't be deputy prime minister and do that kind of thing, and if you've got the view that perhaps I'm not an ordinary kind of guy, perhaps you might be offended by that.'</p> <p>Mmm. Anyway, I reminded him, I did enjoy the television programme. There is a hilarious scene when Prezza is taken to meet three chavs, and asks the producer en route what chav means. She defines it as meaning 'council house and violent' (news to me) but anyway, the girls he meets say they're not chavs, they're middle-class. 'You can't call me working class,' says one unanswerably, 'Cos I don't work.' Prezza is sweetly puzzled by these girls, who run rings round him intellectually, but what is impressive is his desire to understand them. He really wants to get to the bottom of their problems. One of them says she got kicked out of school for violence. 'Someone attacked you?' he asks. No, she explains patiently, she attacked the teacher.</p> <p>The only reason the girls knew who Prezza was is because they saw him on television punching a man who threw an egg at him which, of course, they admired. Prezza in his autobiography seems to regard the punch as his finest hour, though he had a good whinge to me about how this 40-second incident seemed to be the only thing anyone remembered out of his 40-year career. I tried to explain that perhaps it sets a bad example to the young for the deputy prime minister to go round throwing punches - it might for instance lead to 14-year-old girls thinking it was OK to hit teachers. 'Hang on, hang on. What am I supposed to do then - take the belt? Some of the sisters [Harriet Harman and co] took that view down here.'</p> <p>'I agree with them.'</p> <p>'Well I think you're probably one of the sisters then. What would you do if you got belted by a fella?'</p> <p>'Scream. Call the police. Certainly not hit him.'</p> <p>'Would you not defend yourself? You'd just stand there and take it like Jesus Christ or something? Well I don't. I do what I did. You can smile like Tony if you like and walk on by but that's not me, I'm sorry. I've lived my life where I have to defend myself. At sea, if you didn't defend yourself you were in real trouble. When six men came attacking me, am I supposed to say, \"I'm sorry, I don't believe in violence\"? </p> <p>I said to Blair, \"If an ordinary guy had done this, what would you have said?\" And he said, \"But you're not an ordinary guy, you're the deputy prime minister.\" To which I said, \"Can't an ordinary guy be DPM?\" I said: \"If that's the case, then take it off me. I don't want it.\" That's the way I am.'</p> <p>Cue violins - I'm surprised he doesn't break into a rendition of 'My Way'. A lot of what he blames on class - like the fact that Blair almost never invited him to dinner at Number 10 or Chequers - I think has a much simpler explanation. You wouldn't want to invite Prezza to dinner not because he might eat peas with his knife, but because he would bore the other guests to death. When he starts on one of his needy, self-pitying rants about class, there is absolutely no deflecting him. Moreover, his vision of class, where downtrodden salt-of-the-earth mill hands groan under the lash of wicked heartless mill owners, bears no relation to modern Britain. All his ideas seem to derive from three texts he read at Ruskin College in the Sixties - Karl Marx, of course, but also Richard Hoggart's The Uses of Literacy and Michael Young's The Rise of the Meritocracy, both of which date from the Fifties. He doesn't seem to have noticed that society has changed since then. He still imagines the working class saving up for their annual Wakes Week trip to Blackpool; it is left to the Earl of Onslow in the TV programme to break it to him that nowadays his gamekeeper takes holidays in South Africa.</p> <p>He says he enjoyed making the programme but he wouldn't want to do it again. 'I'm not a Michael Portillo. I don't want another career. But I was interested in the idea of doing something on class, and I think people might see me as a different personality to the perception that is put across by the media. Did you find that by watching it?'</p> <p>'Oh yes - you seemed more human.'</p> <p>'Well I think I am that. The press always knock me because I don't have a great deal of time for them. They know they're not going to get any stories out of me so that makes it easy for them to be abusive. I'll probably be a bit abusive as well.'</p> <p>Yes, I said, he was incredibly abusive to Mary Ann Sieghart. 'I'm glad you mentioned that, I felt quite strong about her. Here is a woman who believed that I should not be the deputy prime minister because I could not get my English right! She said that to me! She writes all this abusive stuff - she's never even met me. Can you be violent in words? Yes you can. Words can do as much damage as a punch can do, quite frankly. So I asked her to come and meet me and I said, \"Look, you might have a point that I don't get the language right, but perhaps you might credit that I've done some things that are good in my life. But because the language doesn't come right, you think the brain doesn't work or something. And I just think you're wrong.\" But she just maintained her position - she's a bloody snob.'</p> <p>The danger with having a class bias as pronounced as Prescott's is that it can skew your judgement of other people - you might automatically trust people who sound working class and distrust people who sound posh. Does he do that? </p> <p>'I hope not. I would say I tend to trust people until I find I have reason not to. I do think that people who speak with a certain accent and in that loud way - because what private education does is give you confidence above all else - I notice that I'm a bit more wary of them, because of the values I think come with that. But I still work with them. I don't say, \"Because you're from that background, I can't work with you.\"'</p> <p>This was always his strength as deputy prime minister - he was a brilliant negotiator who managed to keep the Old Labour unionists on board while Blair and Brown were pushing through their New Labour reforms. He also, he claims, played marriage guidance counsellor whenever Blair and Brown were on the brink of divorce. Nowadays he speaks very warmly of Brown and his handling of the financial crisis. He also speaks warmly of Blair, though he hasn't even seen him since he resigned. How does he feel about the return of Peter Mandelson? 'Next question.' Did he remonstrate with Gordon Brown? 'He's the prime minister; he makes his decisions; I won't be saying anything.'</p> <p>Prezza leaves parliament at the next election. 'I've done my bit. Not very successfully from your assessment, but I've done 10 years, I was very privileged to have it, and very, very privileged to work with two great guys, Blair and Brown, to play a part in the party's development. I think we've had 10 years of the most successful government for a long time. Where I will play a part, of course, as I am doing now, is to make sure that we can win a fourth term. I owe everything I have to the Labour party and the Labour movement - everything I have was given to me by them - so the least I can do is make sure I do whatever I can to assist in keeping them in government.'</p> <p>Will he go to the House of Lords? 'My wife would like me to. I'm scared to death of doing nothing. But I need to be convinced I can still do something inside the political system. And I like the Council of Europe work I do, there's a lot of environment things I'm doing over there, so I want to carry on with that. I just wonder if you cut yourself off from the Commons, are you finished? I'm not a guy for looking around for a place on a board, but I do want to continue being active.' I bet we'll end up with the spectacle of Lord Prescott in ermine banging on about how his working-class origins have held him back.</p> <p>Oh, his class chip is a bore! More than half the people I interview come from working-class or disadvantaged backgrounds and I have never, ever heard anyone whinge on about it the way Prescott does. Once he starts, he just won't stop, and the only way you can bring it to a conclusion is to say, 'There, there, Mr Prescott, despite your terrible class handicaps you were the longest-serving deputy prime minister in British history, which must prove something or other about social mobility.' (Actually, I think what it mainly proves is Tony Blair's extraordinary patience, but it would be unhelpful to say so.) The line 'longest-serving deputy prime minister' seems to act on Prescott like a dose of Calpol on a baby, and then he quietens down and says, as if the idea is occurring to him for the very first time, that it's true, he has come a very long way.</p> <p>'Tony always used to say to me, \"The trouble with you, John, is you don't recognise you're the prime minister.\" [Presumably he said deputy prime minister.] Well, if that's the trouble, I don't think I've changed. All my seamen guys from the old Britannic, who I meet every year, say I've not changed. I take some pride in that. I'm still the same JP. And I think that's an achievement, not to have been, I think, spoiled by the system.' It's true that the one virtue of Prescott's chippiness is that at least he isn't smug or pompous, like so many politicians. But given a choice between chippiness and pomposity I'd say it's a bit of a toss-up.</p> <p>'I was on the QE2 this week,' he muses. 'They asked me as an ex-Cunarder to take the pennant of the ship in Liverpool cathedral and pass it to the Lord Mayor. They're proud of me as a Cunarder. So I joined her at Liverpool and went up to Scotland. And I was sitting having breakfast as we were coming up the Clyde and remembering exactly 50 years ago when I was on a ship called the Franconia that used to call at Clyde, but in those days I was serving the meal, not sitting there being served. And it made me think of the point you've made about coming a long way and I think you're right. But on that same ship I couldn't go down to the restaurant and walk in on my own - I still can't do that. I can walk on a stage and talk to 1,000 people, but I can't walk into a restaurant and stand there looking for a seat, I get too embarrassed. I think it's an inferiority built in me which I have to admit to, which has led me to react so strongly to people I identify as public school twits. I wish I had their education! The journalist Julia Langdon many years ago gave me a book on English and said, \"Try and learn.\" But I never had time to do that. And I think that has given me a burn on my side that has led to some of the resentment, and then it gets connected to failing the 11 plus and right through. But I think it's a valid criticism that I should have had more confidence in where I'd arrived.'</p> <p>\u2022 Prescott: The Class System and Me is on BBC2 on October 27 at 9pm</p>",
  "<p>Tim Adams's seven-page outpouring on the grey squirrel 'menace' (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/19/red-squirrels-protection\">'They shoot squirrels, don't they?'</a>, Magazine, last week) was a spectacular example of ignorance, bigotry and historical amnesia. Grey squirrels were introduced into Britain 130 years ago as an ornamental species. They flourished because they are sturdy and readily adapt to a rapidly changing, man-managed environment. Red numbers have dropped drastically because, like the grey today, they were killed over generations, after being accused of taking birds' eggs and damaging forestry.</p> <p>Now the grey is the villain and the red is eulogised. On the charge sheet against the grey is that he destroys red populations by passing on the deadly parapox virus. In fact, red numbers have periodically crashed because of other disease epidemics at a time when the grey wasn't present. As for parapox, news this month indicates that the red is developing immune resistance.<br><strong>Kate Fowler-Reeves</strong><br>Head of Campaigns, Animal Aid,<br>Tonbridge, Kent</p> <p>In outlining his efforts to eradicate grey squirrels, Lord Redesdale describes the Northumberland Wildlife Trust and the Save Our Squirrels project as sitting on the fence by not embracing the killing of grey squirrels. But the Northumberland Wildlife Trust and its partners have never shied away from this; we have been encouraging and carrying out control of greys for years. The difference between our approach and that of Lord Redesdale and his Red Squirrel Protection Partnership, which we supported in their original funding bid, is that we are strategic, aiming what little resource for this work we can muster at important areas where reds will survive longest. This will help their long-term survival, not killing greys throughout England.</p> <p>While it makes good press, Lord Redesdale's vigilante approach is counter to the best interests of the red. We no longer support his efforts as we disapprove of the way the Red Squirrel Protection Partnership is carrying out this work with public funds. They have, indeed, become, in his words, conservation 'cowboys'.<br><strong>Mike Pratt</strong><br>Chief Executive, Northumberland Wildlife Trust; <br>director, Save Our Squirrels Project<br>Newcastle upon Tyne</p> <p>The main threat to red squirrels is the destruction of their oak, hazel and Scots pine forest habitat by humans. The effective method is vaccination.</p> <p>Bill Oddie hasn't 'sat on the fence' about whether to cull greys either. He's against it. There is no species in Britain that hasn't 'invaded' from abroad at some point. You'd have thought the English aristocrats quoted would have empathised with grey squirrel 'invaders' since their ancestors came in from Normandy and mercilessly wiped out thousands of native inhabitants. <br><strong>Jean McFarlane</strong><br>Glasgow</p> <p>Tim Adams's article didn't give the true picture, especially in a week where scientists have been saying they've discovered red squirrels have resistance to squirrel-pox virus (SQPV).

  "<p>Almost four in five British businesses are cutting back on everything from hiring new staff to paying for the office Christmas party, as they batten down the hatches for a deep recession.</p> <p>Even before Friday's official figures revealed that the economy had swung into reverse for the first time since 1992, bosses had begun a series of austerity measures, according to a survey of more than 1,000 firms by the Institute of Directors.</p> <p>Gordon Brown and Bank of England governor Mervyn King both conceded last week that a recession was in store. 'After 15 years of economic growth the party is over,' said Graeme Leach, the IoD's chief economist. 'The pressure on the corporate sector to do something to cut costs is now really starting to come through - but I think people need to be prepared for a lot more bad news over the next 12 to 18 months.'</p> <p>Four out of 10 businesses said they had cut back on recruitment; 27 per cent had reduced pay or bonuses; and another 27 per cent said they were squeezing the entertainment budget, including the Christmas party fund. Only 22 per cent had taken no cost-cutting measures in response to the credit crunch, suggesting its effects are now spreading beyond the banking and housebuilding industries.</p> <p>Brown, who yesterday made a brief campaigning visit to Glenrothes in Scotland before next month's by-election, will tomorrow unveil promises to boost employment by using the public sector. John Denham, the higher education secretary, will promise new apprenticeships in public services to help young people hit by slowing recruitment.</p> <p>Hundreds of apprentices in the construction industry have already been found new employers under a government rescue scheme to sponsor them after their employers went bust, threatening their jobs and the college places attached to them. Ministers fear young people seeking first jobs in other areas may also soon need help, with Denham expected to promise more apprenticeships in administration and business, among other areas.</p> <p>Brown insisted again yesterday that Britain was better prepared for the global crisis than other countries, adding: 'We are doing more to help people who have had problems with their jobs by trying to make vacancies available for people looking for work.'</p> <p>The crisis is expected to strike at the heart of the EU this week, with the International Monetary Fund likely to announce a bailout for Hungary that dwarfs the impact of its \u00a32bn rescue package for the Icelandic economy. Brown spoke to the Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany this weekend and ministers are braced for news that could again send shocks around the major financial centres, with efforts now concentrating on preventing the problems spreading across eastern Europe.</p> <p>The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has also warned that the crisis could strike a 'final blow' to some of the poorest countries, undermining efforts to tackle poverty, disease and climate change. Pakistan's Prime Minister, Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani, told a summit of European and Asian countries in China yesterday that his country was threatened with an 'economic tsunami', according to Foreign Secretary David Miliband, who attended. Miliband said the world was experiencing a 'big shift' in economic power. 'What is also clear is that there's been an increase in economic vulnerability. What has come out of this meeting, I think, is renewed commitment to multilateral co-operation.'</p> <p>Such ideas are expected to be discussed at a meeting next month of the G20 key nations in Washington. Miliband said there was a 'sense of shared commitment' to solving the problem. The Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, confirmed China would participate in the crisis summit. 'We must use every means to prevent the financial crisis impacting growth of the real economy,' he said.</p> <p>Analysts predict a downturn in Britain at least as long and deep as the damaging early 1990s recession. 'The prospects for the UK economy are grim, with a fairly severe recession starting to unfold,' said Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citigroup. 'We seem to be in a vicious circle: recession, asset price declines and financial stress are mutually reinforcing.'</p> <p>He predicted that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee would slash interest rates to 3 per cent, from 4.5 per cent, by the middle of next year, beginning with a half-point reduction early next month. In the US, rates are expected to be cut to 1 per cent this week to stimulate confidence.</p>",
  "<p>A plant popular in garden ponds faces a sales ban in Britain amid fears that it could devastate wetlands, choke waterways and increase the risk of flooding.</p> <p>Water primrose - or Ludwigia - is out of control in rivers and canals in France, and Belgium and the Netherlands are also spending hundreds of thousands of pounds battling the alien invader, originally from South America.</p> <p>At least six sites of infestation have been identified in southern England and Wales, including at the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust's centre in London, according to the Environment Agency.</p> <p>Now the government is considering banning its sale, and gardeners are warned to be extremely vigilant about preventing further escape into the wild.</p> <p>Trevor Renals, invasive species adviser at the EA, said the plant's ability to double its biomass in 15-20 days, and the dense matting it forms above and below the water, made it 'a profound threat and potentially devastating for our wetlands, with all the implications for breeding birds and native species'.</p> <p>Environmentalists now hope that Defra will agree an amendment to the Wildlife and Countryside Act under which water primrose cannot be introduced to the wild without a licence.</p>",
  "<p>When Peter Mandelson was ennobled recently, one lord was reported to have described his new peer as 'a quintessential Jew'. It isn't clear whether or not that was meant as a compliment. Let's assume not. Mandelson is not Jewish in any way orthodox believers, or most other people, would recognise. He has a Jewish-sounding name because his father was Jewish. That's it. So if he is the 'quintessence', on what remote periphery of 'Jewishness' are the people who actually practise Judaism?</p> <p>That, of course, is beside the point, as anyone familiar with the intellectual contortions of anti-semitism knows. Anyone unfamiliar with that prejudice, or who thought it was a purely historical artefact, should read Denis MacShane's Globalising Hatred: The New Anti-Semitism. MacShane, a Labour MP and former minister, doesn't deal specifically with Mandelson-baiting, but he would recognise the warped thinking behind it. Mandelson's ostensible non-Jewishness is exactly what sets him up as the perfect stereotype: the furtive puppet-master; the Svengali; the 'Prince of Darkness'; slippery, a bit too clever, dishonest.</p> <p>There is a long tradition of Westminster old boys being snide about Jewish parvenus. Tory grandees in the early Eighties issued a collective harrumph at Margaret Thatcher's promotion of Leon Brittan, Nigel Lawson and Michael Howard ('More old Estonian than old Etonian' in Harold MacMillan's famous dig). MacShane treats that sort of chatter - 'dinosaur Tory anti-semitism' - briskly. He is more concerned about a resurgence of overt and vicious treatment of Jews, including a rise in violent crimes against them. This is no speculation. MacShane presents ample evidence of increased hostility in nearly every country with a large Jewish community - and in those without one, too. In Japan, for example, there is a brisk trade in pamphlets purporting to expose a plot by Jewish financiers to control the world.</p> <p>The sinister global conspiracy is one of the oldest and most pervasive tropes of anti-semitism. In the first half of the 20th century, that generally meant presenting the Jews as responsible for Bolshevism. In the 1950s, the Foreign Office suspected that the new state of Israel was a Soviet puppet. Meanwhile, the Kremlin was conducting a purge of 'rootless cosmopolitans' - code for Jews. Israel is now generally regarded as an American proxy. Or, rather, America is judged around the world to be controlled by Jews, through the 'Israel lobby'. </p> <p>MacShane devotes some time to deconstructing that particular idiom. American Jews, he points out, are entitled to call on their government to pursue a certain policy. There are two reasons why that might look pernicious: first, if it is assumed that the government in question exercises no critical judgment of its own - that the 'lobby' is not a supplicant to power but the hidden source of it; second, if it is assumed that the policy request is unquestionably repulsive. Both assumptions in the case of the US alliance with Israel are false. Both, when applied to the influence of Jews, reek of anti-semitism. </p> <p>There are lots of features of US policy that foreigners, and plenty of Americans, think are misguided. But only with Israel do critics seem to assume that the White House loses all rationality and takes dictation from some extraneous, parasitical force. If the 'Israel lobby' was all-powerful, MacShane notes, it might have done something by now about Washington's solid alliance with Saudi Arabia, which is the chief exporter of an ideology explicitly dedicated to the destruction of Israel and of the Jews. </p> <p>MacShane looks at the set texts of radical jihadi Islam and finds them full of abuse of Jews. He observes that the idea of an aggressive Jewish conspiracy is not a marginal strand in Islamist radicalism, but the essential premise. An ideological edifice of murderous hatred towards Jews is being erected in communities around the world and yet many people think anti-semitism is something that once happened in pre-war Europe. Worse, many left-leaning, liberal intellectuals seem to think that anti-Israel rhetoric is one of the more reasonable bits of the jihadi agenda - that on Zionism, at least, the terrorists have a point. Except that, by Zionists, al-Qaeda means Jews and its reason for hating them is that they are conspiring to control the world. Any complicity with that notion was anti-semitic in the Thirties and it still is. </p> <p>Globalising Hatred is a small klaxon of a book, more concerned with raising the alarm than building a thesis. The arguments sometimes reel around giddily but are steadied on their way by solid facts. And in case you wondered, no, Denis MacShane is not Jewish. Does that make a difference to his argument? </p>",
  "<p>With the markets crashing once more and the last rites being pronounced over Western capitalism, the consensus is that autumn 2008 is when global economic power will have been seen to pass to Asia in general and China in particular. This is the new economic powerhouse. Its growth may slow a little while the West flounders, but it will emerge from this recession as the world's centre of economic and financial gravity. Goodbye, USA. Hello, the Chinese Communist party.</p> <p>It is fashionable foolishness that ignores some brute realities. The first is that Asia, except Japan, remains in essence a subcontractor to the West. Two-thirds of China's exports, for example, are made by foreign companies who essentially reprocess imports of semi-manufactured goods that are then shipped to Europe and the US. It is an economy that does not innovate - it is the great copier and counterfeiter of Western technology. This may change over the next 200 years, but not during the lifetime of most of the people reading this column.</p> <p>It is true there are Asian hot spots. South Korea is following Japan's lead, while India, whose foreign trade is smaller than Spain's, has promising companies and dynamic cities. Then there are Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok. But poverty, illiteracy, sexism and caste still dominate. The notion that mainland Asia is about to supplant the US, EU and Japan in the near future is risible. </p> <p>Nor is Asia set to prop up the shattered Western economy. This is the other fashionable notion peddled until recently. Asia is now so strong and independent of the West, ran the argument, that it has 'decoupled'. It would carry on spending and producing, so partly underwriting the world economy and ameliorate the worst of the coming recession.</p> <p>Asia's terrified financial markets, coming to terms with their region's vulnerability, are now testimony to this profound misunderstanding. Asia is an exporter and saver, of which the best example is China. It consumes a smaller proportion of GDP than it saves, with total consumption lower than Italy's. If its exports stagnate, as they have with the rise of the renminbi against the dollar and the slowing of American spending, then its economy slows down. The rate of growth has dropped by a quarter over the last 12 months and there is every prospect of a further sizable drop over the next 12. </p> <p>Nor can investment rise to fill the gap. China is saturated with ports, highways, steel mills, cement and petrochemical plants that operate at a fraction of capacity. As the realisation has grown that capacity has run far ahead of now falling demand, China's bubble economy has burst rather like our own. Its stock market has crashed and property prices are collapsing. The manufacturing heart in the Pearl River area near Hong Kong is being destroyed. Half the 2,200 factories in the shoe industry have shut, as have a third of the 3,600 toy factories. </p> <p>China's ever-growing demand for raw materials is easing. Although the Chinese government says its sheltered banking system is insulated from problems in the West, last week top Chinese investment firm CITIC reported a $2bn loss from taking 'unauthorised' positions in the derivatives markets. China's banking system is a house of cards, with billions of dollars of toxic loans made at the party's request to loss-making enterprises set against tiny amounts of core capital. Some unexpected losses and the results could make the West's financial crisis look tame.</p> <p>The party is acutely aware of the risk, lowering interest rates and considering a big boost in infrastructure spending. Outsiders seem perplexed at the alarm that growth may subside to 7 per cent next year; would that Britain and the West will be so lucky.</p> <p>But bear in mind two key facts. China managed to grow throughout the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution at nearly 5 per cent per annum. The bulk of the adult population still farms tiny plots of hopelessly unproductive land in grinding poverty. All it takes is a tiny fraction of its workers moving from doing nothing in the countryside to doing something in the towns deploying modern technology to produce growth. In these conditions, only 5 per cent growth is a crisis. </p> <p>If 7 to 8 per cent growth is better, it will still not stave off a sharp increase in unemployment. Already there is an explosion of what the Chinese call 'incidents' - social unrest. As the Ministry of Labour has warned, China needs to create jobs with sky-high growth rates if it is to retain social stability. </p> <p>In which case it must change. It has to consume more and become more innovative and productive. But communism stands as a roadblock. </p> <p>The party is considering an amazing concession - allowing peasants to be able to buy and sell long leases on their land. This would be the biggest step towards granting property rights to 730 million rural peasants since the Revolution. The reason? The party needs them to use their land as collateral to save less and spend more. It is political dynamite, removing one of the key props of the party's support - its control of villages and land rights. But it must be considered. China is beginning the perilous path to becoming freer because the economy demands it.</p> <p>Then there is innovation, where its track record is abominable. China accounts for only 0.1 per cent of the world's patents that apply in Japan, the EU and the US. Economists believe the invention of general-purpose technologies, like the internal combustion engine, internet or aeroplane, that have massive general application, holds the key to growth and will accelerate in the decades ahead. Not one of this century's general-purpose technologies will be made outside the West and Japan, which have held a monopoly for 300 years. Their lead will widen rather than narrow. </p> <p>The Chinese government knows it must unblock control of universities, laboratories and business if China is to change this dismal prediction and create the subtle combination of freedom to experiment and incentives in which innovation flourishes. Meanwhile, the West's financial travails are not for ever. Once they are solved, the West will be back, exploiting its capacity to innovate.</p> <p>Authoritarian Asian capitalism is not about to triumph over the Western liberal variant. China needs to change profoundly if it is to join the first rank of nations as their equal. Meanwhile, don't look to it - or the rest of Asia - to soften recession. The West made this mess. It must clear it up itself.</p>",
  "<p>In January, Gordon Brown said of the credit crunch: 'Britain is better placed than most to withstand the global turbulence.' </p> <p>It was an optimistic claim and Mr Brown probably believed it. But that doesn't mean it was true.</p> <p>Statistics released last week showed Britain's economy shrank by 0.5 per cent, more than was widely forecast, in the last quarter. Technically, it is only a recession if growth shrinks again between now and Christmas, but few doubt that will happen.</p> <p>Businesses are starved of capital, house prices are falling and wages have not kept up with inflation, making consumers feel poorer. They spend less, so demand for goods and services shrinks. Unemployment is rising at the highest rate for 17 years. This isn't a gentle slowdown. The brakes are on hard, the wheels of the economy have locked. </p> <p>Last week, Mr Brown acknowledged what the rest of us have known for months. Recession is likely, he said, 'in America, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and - because no country can insulate itself from it - Britain, too'.</p> <p>That was more caveat than candour. The implication is that recession is a foreign ailment that the UK only contracted through its exposure to global financial markets. </p> <p>But for a decade, the government promoted the City of London as the international centre of financial services. A financial boom poured cheap credit into the real economy, with Britons taking on vast levels of personal debt - more than in any other developed country. Loose money stoked a housing bubble bigger, according to the IMF, than the one that burst in the US, triggering the crisis. A disproportionate amount of British wealth is borrowed and tied up in assets whose value is falling; a disproportionate number of jobs are in services that are vulnerable to a fall in consumer demand. The credit crunch may have started abroad, but it was custom-made to hurt Britain.</p> <p>Naturally, Mr Brown does not want to admit that, since he was in charge of the economy for the last decade. Naturally, the Conservatives take every opportunity to remind people of that fact. David Cameron wants voters to blame Mr Brown for the recession; Mr Brown wants them to blame the rest of the world. </p> <p>Both sides have hidden motives for playing this game. The Tories want to buy time, as they do not yet have a coherent strategy of their own for dealing with a recession. The government has a broad strategy - abandoning its own rules on borrowing and pumping money into the economy - but wants to keep the global contagion defence in reserve, in case its plans don't work. </p> <p>In theory, if the private sector has stalled, it should be possible to kick-start the economy with public money. The government hopes to put cash into people's pockets, putting pressure on the banks, in which it now has a stake, to lend again. It has also talked vaguely of increased investment in infrastructure, creating jobs to stimulate demand. But either way, it is hard to guarantee that the money will flow speedily back into the wider economy. </p> <p>It is not just economic activity, but confidence that is collapsing. People might reasonably react against the old culture of profligacy and hoard their cash.</p> <p>A recession is a social shock as much as an economic one, with consequences that have nothing do with global markets. The Home Office acknowledged months ago that crime was likely to rise. Last week's pledge by Immigration Minister Phil Woolas that the government will limit population growth looks like an attempt to pre-empt a rise in hostility towards immigrants as recession leads to increased competition for fewer jobs.</p> <p>That is a blame game far removed from the one in which Mr Brown and Mr Cameron are engaged, and more dangerous. The Prime Minister thinks that if he can persuade people that recession was caused abroad, they will unite in solidarity behind him, that he can create an economic 'Blitz spirit'. But economic turbulence could just as easily bring social fragmentation and conflict.</p> <p>Yesterday, Mr Brown still sounded optimistic. His past decisions meant, he said, that 'we are better prepared to deal with a world economic problem'. </p> <p>By denying how vulnerable the 'real' economy is to recession, Mr Brown is deferring engagement with the its real social consequences. He can keep reminding us that other countries face a downturn, but he needs to recognise that the one he is answerable for is uniquely British.</p>",
  "<p>There can be no advance in rugby without retreat, no progression without recession. What happens off the field might, in a kind world, be viewed as a replica of the ebb and flow of play on it. To view things with a wearier eye, you have people looking ahead and then you have Wales. </p> <p>This has to be brief. After four years of being stultified by the issue of player-release in England, there are only so many seconds left in an onlooker's life for the same in Wales. Except to say that if ever a country could look at two Six Nations Grand Slams in three years and say that they were possible because of a logical, unwritten understanding between the regional feeder teams and the national side, it was Wales. </p> <p>And now this: the Welsh Rugby Union and the four regions - sorry, the WRU and the new collective-bargaining authority called Regional Rugby Wales - stand in the kindergarten waving their nappies at each other. Roger Lewis, CEO of the establishment WRU, and David Moffett, his predecessor and now leader of the militant RRW, are shouting poo at each other. </p> <p>Without wishing to give Lewis the advantage of standing atop a moral molehill on this matter, you have to chuckle at the presence of Moffett in all this. He was the bloke who created the regions in the first place, much against the wishes of anyone bar the accountants. It's like Frankenstein's monster asking its creator to choreograph its routine at the Brynmawr Little Miss Sunshine pageant. </p> <p>Only in Wales, eh? Or, as they seem to be saying: 'We've got to have this, because they had it in England.' It is a slur on the independent rugby spirit of Wales that the current rugby leaders - and that includes Warren Gatland, the coach of the 2008 Grand Slam side, who waded in with the heavy tread of a front-row forward - have allowed Wales to be dragged into a copy-cat conflict. </p> <p>Enough. At least there is progress elsewhere, as Australia and New Zealand prepare to face each other in Hong Kong on Saturday. It's a serious Test, part of this year's Bledisloe Cup series, even if New Zealand, 2-1 up, have already retained the trophy. </p> <p>Both teams are on their way to Europe for arduous tours, but have the vision to drop in on one of Asia's hot-spots of potential growth. </p> <p>The All Blacks have had more rugby lately, the Air New Zealand Cup reaching its conclusion yesterday. Action always comes with risks. Scrum-half Andy Ellis, for example, injured himself in earlier rounds. But inactivity carries perhaps even greater dangers. Without any rugby in Australia since mid-September, the Wallabies have had four training camps, where coach Robbie Deans has introduced a new... I think they call it authenticity. </p> <p>Aiming for the real thing in training has seen off second-rows Hugh McMeniman and James Horwill, plus utility back-five forward Peter Kimlin. The Wallabies have already lost a couple of their larger players: Dan Vickerman, at the age of 29, to start a three-year course in economics at Cambridge University, and Rocky Elsom to Leinster. </p> <p>Still, the tour may be arduous for the Wallabies, in that they play the All Blacks, Italy, England, France, Wales and the Barbarians on consecutive Saturdays, but it is not quite the nine-month mission undertaken by the very first Wallabies in 1908. That first team - the tour about to begin is to celebrate the centenary - found that their time in Britain coincided with the London Olympics. The Wallabies played and beat Britain, as represented by county champions Cornwall, 32-3 in the final to take the gold medal. This sounds very grand but there were only two entrants. </p> <p>At the four Games where rugby was played, between 1900 and 1924, no more than three teams ever competed. The US won gold in 1920 and 1924, beating France in both finals to become the last and reigning Olympic rugby champions. </p> <p>If that, too, sounds grand, matters were a little less ethereal at Stade Colombes, Paris, in 1924, where the US, essentially Stamford University American football team, upset the home team, much to the displeasure of the crowd. They booed the victors' anthem and then advanced on the team. Substitute Gideon Nelson was flattened by a walking stick, and thus ended rugby at the Olympics. </p> <p>Until now, those in rugby with an eye on a progressive future believe. Rugby Sevens is pitching for inclusion at the Olympics in 2016, the campaign starting now and the decision being made next October. Rugby Sevens is one of seven sports - baseball, softball, golf, squash, roller sports and karate are the others - from which two will be selected. </p> <p>If there are selling points, one would be that rugby would use - and fill - the Olympic stadium between the opening ceremony and the start of the athletics programme. Another would be that rugby is prepared to take itself to new places and excite new audiences. </p> <p>If rugby were to be selected it would do wonders at junior levels in a whole new raft of countries where state funding is dependent on a sport's inclusion in the Olympic programme. Rugby could be going truly global. </p> <p>Meanwhile in Wales.... At least there will be a job for life for David Moffett, who could go from regional to national negotiator, his brief to determine the number of Welsh players in the GB Olympic team. He could start by saying: 'We've got to have the same as England.'</p>",
  "<p>The most important building in European football is a stylish labyrinth of steel and glass in Nyon, a town tucked away on the banks of Lake Geneva on the edges of French-speaking Switzerland. This is the headquarters of Uefa, where every big decision about football, from the size of the balls for youth teams to the rules of their international competitions, is made. Appropriately enough for an organisation often demonised by English fans as the enemy of the game, the place has something of the look and atmosphere of the lair of a James Bond baddie. Uefa foot soldiers scurry busily about the sleek and gleaming corridors; if the place ever caught fire, or came under assault from English fans, you can just imagine them making good their escape in the underground tunnels, heading for the boats and then the tranquil lake beyond.</p> <p>Not that the officials of Uefa have anything to worry about right now. This place has a supremely confident atmosphere, as befits an organisation that has been running European football since 1955 and is now home to the Champions League, and all other European competitions at every level. This confidence is also exuded by Michel Platini, Uefa's president, as we shake hands in the boardroom and sit down to discuss the future of football in Europe, including the Premier League. Platini is slightly chubbier than in his mid-1980s prime when, with Juventus and France, he was probably the best midfielder in the world, but he has lost none of his impish charm. His eyes have a roguish, humorous glint and he is quick to take off his jacket, serve coffee and joke about the grandeur of his position, which he took up in 2007.</p> <p>But he is deadly serious about his new role as the most important man in the European game. Unlike his predecessor, Lennart Johansson, Platini is unafraid of controversy. Traditionally the role is one of soft diplomacy, negotiating around the big and powerful clubs. One of the accusations made against Uefa in the past has been that they have run scared of those clubs, intimidated by their financial and political clout. But this is not how Platini sees his organisation.</p> <p>'Uefa has a big role as the guardian of European football,' he says. 'It is not about money but values. And that is why I am here.' This is not, however, the way many people in England see it. Most notably, Platini's scathing comments on the Premier League, arguing mainly that it has distorted the balance of power in European football, tipping the odds permanently in favour of the richest English clubs, have made him many enemies at the top level of the game. </p> <p>The black propaganda about Platini is that he is simply anti-English; the complaints are down at grassroots level, in blogs and on the terraces. The case against him is based on his refusal to back England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup and his comment in June that, on their current form, the England team would not be missed from Euro 2008: 'England's absence means nothing to me,' he famously remarked. This is when the blogs went ballistic, accusing Platini of every Gallic crime under the sun, from cowardice to outright Brit-bashing.</p> <p>But none of this is as simple as it seems; Platini would say he has the greatest respect for England as the home of football. This is why he wants to save us from ourselves, by which he means the over-arching power and sheer tedium of the Premier League. One of his most provocative steps was his 2007 proposal that major European countries allocate a Champions League place to the winners of their national cup. This, in England's case, would mean replacing the fourth team in the league with the FA Cup winners.</p> <p>Predictably, this was given short shrift by the G-14 - a group of the most powerful clubs in Europe, since superseded by the larger European Club Association. The Premier League clubs, with Liverpool and Manchester United leading the way, have been particularly angry that a hard-fought-for Champions League place, with its massive financial rewards, could go to, say, Stoke or Aston Villa - teams who in any given year could pull off a good cup run and might then become rich without the benefit of multimillionaire backers. </p> <p>So far Uefa and Platini have backed off in the face of the opposition, but are still seeking to introduce less cash-rich countries into the footballing elite of Spain, Italy, Germany and England. For example Platini's latest plans, announced this summer, include investigating the high levels of debt at the top clubs. He calls this 'cheating' and wants to establish 'a level playing field'. Manchester United and Chelsea in particular have taken umbrage at this, although you cannot help feeling that is because at some level they know Platini is right. He also wants to introduce a ban on international transfers on players under the age of 18, which he says will stop clubs poaching players from poorer and more vulnerable countries.</p> <p>Ordinary English fans are also suspicious of Platini's perceived attacks on the Premier League, guessing that what he really wants to do is prevent the kind of English superiority that led to Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United battling it out in the final four places in last season's Champions League. The more rabid fans see him as a demented French racist who hates the English and wants to undo the 'golden age' of the Premier League. So is he a hero, villain or madman?</p> <p>Platini laughs at the question. But he is also quick to make two penetrating points: first, that there is no such thing as the 'golden age' of the Premier League, merely a permanent stand-off between the richest teams, all of whom are supported by unfeasible levels of debt. 'All fans of football in England know in their hearts that this is the case,' he tells me. 'Soon in England you will have no English players, no English managers, just foreign speculators.' Most damagingly, Platini also asserts that so-called 'English superiority' is a myth when nearly all of the players in the top English teams are foreigners. 'You have to ask yourself what that means for football at a national level. England is the traditional home of football, but do you think that England will ever win the World Cup again? When you look at the statistics right now - when hardly any English players are in the final stages of the Champions League - it is a good question, and the answer is probably no. At least it will not happen under the present structures.' Although his critics could point out that there were 10 England players in the starting line-ups when Manchester United played Chelsea in May's final.</p> <p>Platini's most powerful enemy at the highest level is Richard Scudamore, the chief executive of the Premier League, who, in a response to Platini's suggestion in 2007 that the power of the Premier League had to be curtailed, described his views as not much more than you would hear in 'the corner of a pub'. Platini smiles again. 'I am a football man, not a businessman or a politician, and so I would rather be closer to the fans in the pub than, say, Richard Scudamore. You have to remember that football is a game - a beautiful game, yes, and one that makes millions, but it is a game, a spectacle made for the fans and not the money-men.' The most recent manager to face Platini's barbs is Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who was accused by Platini in the pages of the Bordeaux newspaper Sud-Ouest of poaching youngsters of 13 for the Arsenal academy. 'Ars\u00e8ne is TMPG - Tout pour ma gueule [Everything for my own gob],' he said. Platini recanted a week later in the pages of Le Parisien. 'I was too hard on Ars\u00e8ne,' he said in a rather meagre apology. But still the point was made.</p> <p>Throughout his playing career, Michel Platini was a crowd-pleaser. The defining features of his style were an elegant mastery of long, dribbling runs, often at top speed, and an indomitable bravado that endeared him to players and fans alike. His early career was often marred by injury - he was a carefree player in the tough French league of the 1970s and early 1980s, a far more physical environment than it is now. He never walked away from even the toughest defenders, preferring to dazzle them into submission.</p> <p>He began his professional career with AS Nancy in 1972, winning the French second division in 1975 and the French Cup three years later, but hit the heights with Saint-Etienne. When Platini joined in 1979, Saint-Etienne were ambitious and hungry for a European trophy. But they were also a team in a long, slow decline and, despite success in the French league in 1981, the great nights of European glory that they had known in the 1970s - most notably losing narrowly in the final of the European Cup in 1976 - were a fading memory. </p> <p>Platini stamped his authority on European football as the midfield general of Juventus in the mid-1980s. He joined the Italians in 1982 and was the top scorer in Serie A three times running. But it was not always straightforward: he had a shaky start in Turin and at first thought of leaving Italy under pressure from its media cauldron. Forging a world-class partnership with the Pole Zbigniew Boniek, however, he led Juventus to the 1984 European Cup-Winners' Cup and the European Super Cup. </p> <p>In 1985, he scored the winning goal - a controversial penalty - against Liverpool in the European Cup final at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels. This was the terrible night when 39 fans were killed during riots that brought down a stadium wall. Platini has gone down in Scouse folklore as the man who celebrated the disputed penalty with far too much enthusiasm. I have to say that as a Liverpool fan watching that night with the same sick feeling as everyone else, I too remember the clenched fist to the Juve crowd, baying for a dark revenge on Liverpool. I feel it my duty to ask Platini how he felt that night. It is the only moment when he looks uncomfortable. 'Those are bad memories,' he says. 'They were bad times for football. But I did not know what was happening in the stadium. My parents were in the crowd and they didn't know either. But the match had to be played, and I did my duty.'</p> <p>Footage of the match bears out Platini's testimony; he does indeed wave his fist at the crowd in celebration, but then straightaway he is grim-faced, resolute, back on task. The dreadful atmosphere had evidently got to him too, whether or not he knew what was happening. </p> <p>According to Platini himself, the greatest match he played in was the classic encounter between France and West Germany in the 1982 World Cup semi-finals, in Seville. This match had everything - full-on drama, twists of fate and two opponents equally matched in skill and desire. Most significantly, it was a clash between two footballing philosophies - the hard-core machine-like efficiency of West Germany and the lightning-quick brilliance of the elegant French, who could fairly make claim to be the 'European Brazil'. There was also an obvious villain in German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher, who battered the French defender Patrick Battiston to the ground, knocking him unconscious. Schumacher briefly made himself the most hated man in football, as he preened in front of goal, taunting the French fans, and eventually saving the penalty that took the Germans through to the final. 'It should have been our World Cup,' Platini says now, without the least sense of nostalgia, 'but that's what football is about. It's tragedy and heartbreak as well as winning. It is also about values - it's about good and evil.'</p> <p>With this, Platini returns to the theme of football values and the Premier League. 'It's also clear that money does not make a team,' he says. 'The example of Manchester City will be very interesting, but whatever happens it won't be about football but about politics and economics. And it's also debt. What happens when the money moves on? This is what happens in capitalist economic systems and it will happen.' I put it to him that what he is describing is essentially a conflict between Anglo-Saxon neo-liberalism and the European model of corporatist socialism. 'I prefer to say democratic socialism,' he says. 'But, yes. That is the situation.'</p> <p>In a weak defence of the Premier League, I cite the examples of Silvio Berlusconi and Gianni Agnelli bankrolling AC Milan and Juventus, respectively. But I am quickly wrong-footed by the wily Frenchman. 'Ah, but Agnelli was from Turin and Berlusconi from Milan. They were football men. I have nothing against millionaires but they must have football values and some link with the club. American and Arabian owners can never properly be part of the fans.'</p> <p>But did this mean that the French League, for example, had some moral authority over the Premier League? 'It is a different case,' he says. 'The French League exports players, which means that it can have success at a national level. Although my own opinion is that French football has become too technical, and that is why they are not too successful at the moment. They work hard at Clairefontaine [the most famous of France's nine elite training academies] but football is not just about work. Also' - and suddenly we're back to the iniquities of the Premier League! - ' I think many young French players are too interested in money in England than football in France.' </p> <p>Platini comes to life when we discuss French football culture. Not least of his achievements was to be part of a generation of French footballers who garnered the interest of French intellectuals, both for their elegant style of play and as part of the growing importance of mass culture in stuffy old highbrow France. 'Until the 1980s, football in France was a game for beaufs [chavs],' he says. 'I was even ashamed to tell my wife I was a footballer. [President] Mitterrand was a fan of football but he kept it quiet because the intellectuals would have sneered at him.' All of this changed with the Platini generation of the France team, which with Alain Giresse and Jean Tigana in the midfield was both flamboyant and elegant. Arguably, the Zinedine Zidane generation, which won the 1998 World Cup, would never have happened without these three: certainly the French love affair with football, which was pretty much universal throughout the 1990s, was born with this team. </p> <p>Platini is still very keen to present himself as a man of the people, an ordinary bloke, the voice of footballing common sense. But beneath this carefully constructed surface, there is a fierce and cunning intelligence. This is a man unafraid to use the word 'hegemony' in public (just imagine even Alan Hansen deploying this word correctly and with ease) and his ruffled charm has even made him an icon of France's gay community.</p> <p>Most famously, and perhaps most strangely, in 1987 Platini gave a long interview in the pages of the radical newspaper Lib\u00e9ration to the writer Marguerite Duras. To find an equivalent these days, this would be like Wayne Rooney in dialogue with AC Grayling. To make matters more confused, Duras - then the feminist icon of the French literary establishment - was a disciple of Georges Bataille, the notoriously convoluted philosopher of an erotic form of existentialism. Duras asked Platini questions such as: 'To be a footballer of genius is to be a martyr. You play in a dream, beyond any law - is this angelic or demonic?'</p> <p>'Quite frankly I have no idea what she was on about,' Platini says now. 'But it was extremely good fun. And it got me known with intellectuals. And that's OK. But I am a football man.'</p> <p>And with this, we're back to the present day. Platini's big message is that he is here 'to protect football'. He has a tough job on his hands - as he acknowledges, his mission at Uefa is at least as big as any of the footballing challenges he has faced. He is adamant that his presidency is not just an honorary position and that, just because he has been rebuffed by the big guns in the early stages, it does not mean the game is over. 'I believe in football,' he says. 'I am not here for any other purpose than to make sure it survives in the form that we all came to love it - as a simple game that gives pleasure and excitement and beauty to everyone. And that includes the English fans.'</p> <p>Certainly, Platini does look like he is taking Uefa to some interesting places. He is a sly political operator, suited for the feints and counter-feints of the game's administration. Most significantly, he has a clear agenda for change, which he intends to implement across the board. He argues that change must come from the bottom up and that the youth academies, which are in fact 'football factories where young players are force-fed a diet of over-training and financial cynicism', are killing the game: 'Football has a social role,' he insists, 'which is not just about taking young lads from third-world countries and making them into superstars.' Under Platini, Uefa aim to restore the balance between local and amateur clubs and what he calls 'le grand football' of big business. All of this will need to be regulated by Uefa.</p> <p>It is no less than a battle for the soul of soccer. Platini is not anti-English. He speaks with authority and love of the English game. But like many of us in England, he is nostalgic for a time when English football was a real game rather than an exercise in financial one-upmanship.</p> <p>He is also passionate about the game. More to the point, outside the boardrooms of the richest clubs, every fan who wants to be a real supporter rather than a consumer knows he is right. If he gets his way, it may just be that the crafty Frenchman with an eye for the main chance will be the unlikely saviour of English football.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Kinnear has been minding his language since receiving a ticking-off from the Football Association in the wake of his foul-mouthed rant at reporters but Newcastle United's interim manager could hardly be blamed for cursing when Shola Ameobi missed a superb second-half chance in today's Tyne-Wear derby.</p> <p>After heading Newcastle level during the first period, Ameobi was ruffling Anton Ferdinand and Danny Collins. Both were wrongfooted when Obafemi Martins slipped him a sweet pass and, virtually unmarked, the centre forward only had Marton Fulop to beat.</p> <p>In the event Sunderland's stand-in Hungarian goalkeeper saw the resultant shot sail woefully off target leaving Newcastle fans collectively shaking their heads and muttering, \"same old Shola\".</p> <p>Had he scored Newcastle would have gone 2-1 up and might have proceeded to record their first win under Kinnear's charge and their second Premier League victory of the season. Granted Sunderland's superior passing and greater number of chances merited this first derby triumph on Wearside since 1980, but games hinge on the finest of margins and Kinnear had reason to rue Mark Viduka's latest injury-induced absence.</p> <p>It is no coincidence that the Tynesiders's revival late last season under Kevin Keegan came when Michael Owen was allowed to flourish in a role playing just behind the Australian striker. Owen, of course, is injured as well right now. Indeed, while Newcastle did not play as well as in recent draws against Everton and Manchester City, Kinnear can, like many a St James' Park predecessor, complain that fortune is frowning on him.</p> <p>It did not help, for instance, that Nicky Butt was clearly hampered by a foot injury, which at one point required restitching. Some coaches might have gambled on starting Joey Barton but, without a full game in six months, that would have been quite a risk.</p> <p>Nonetheless the pitch might have been a safer place for a midfielder dubbed 'football's baddest lad' than the sidelines where Barton's warming up routines were disgracefully, if predictably, interrupted by a shower of missiles. It remains to be seen what Kinnear can do with a fully-fit squad and how a match-fit Barton will respond to his strictures but at least the interim manager has effected certain individual improvements.</p> <p>Some managers rarely speak to players individually, preferring to keep them guessing. Kinnear though has always been into private chats, even going so far as to take senior players at Wimbledon out for drinks. In Shola Ameobi's case he has taken things one step further. Kinnear has been giving the striker, who Kevin Keegan fruitlessly attempted to offload to assorted Championship clubs this summer, private afternoon lessons in the art of discomfiting defenders. Judging by the sporadically fazed looks on the faces of Collins and Ferdinand - and just where was Rio's little brother when an unattended Ameobi headed the opener? - such tutorials are, at least partially, having the desired effect.</p> <p>It is now two goals in two games for the Geordie-Nigerian striker that Kinnear has pledged to turn into 'the new John Fashanu'. Talking of Ameobi's African heritage - he was born in Nigeria and emigrated to Tyneside with his parents as a small boy - he has offered a reminder that he was once rated sufficiently promising to prompt a tug-of-war between London and Lagos.</p> <p>I remember interviewing Howard Wilkinson, then the England Under-21 manager, in a Yorkshire hotel before a junior game at Barnsley where Ameobi was scheduled to make his international debut. During our chat Wilkinson explained that the FA were fearful that their Nigerian counterparts were hatching a last minute plot to hijack Ameobi and persaude him to turn out for the country of his birth rather than gamble on one day leading England to World Cup glory.</p> <p>Even though England's bus was not waylaid by highwaymen en route to Oakwell and Ameobi scored twice on his debut that always seemed unlikely. \"Shola's definitely got something,\" mused Wilkinson afterwards. \"I'm not quite sure exactly what though.\"</p> <p>Other managers, Keegan especially, have been equally uncertain about Ameobi's slightly unorthodox talents. Although his touch is better than it looks he is not ultra-combative and responds to stroking rather than kicking. It is no coincidence that his best football - and a ratio of one goal every other game - came under the management of Glenn Roeder who persistently told Ameobi he was \"the biz\".</p> <p>Kinnear is doing something similar but must privately be counting the days until Owen and, arguably more importantly, Viduka are fit again.</p>",
  "<p>Asian and European leaders today called for more international regulation and a stronger role for the International Monetary Fund in response to the worst financial crisis since the 1930s.</p> <p>The call for changes to the international financial system came at the end of a two-day summit of 43 Asian and European leaders in Beijing, discussing what began as a crisis in the US housing market that went on to infect the global economy.</p> <p>Echoing the call from Beijing, the US president, George Bush, said that agreement on principles for reform would be essential in preventing another disaster. </p> <p>Bush, who will host a global summit on the financial crisis next month, said in his weekly radio address: \"In recent weeks, concerns about the availability of credit, the safety of financial assets, and the volatility of the stock market have made many families understandably anxious about their economic future.\" </p> <p>Governments have pledged around $4 trillion to support banks and restart money markets to try to avert a global recession that will hit developing countries hardest.</p> <p>The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, yesterday warned that the crisis could strike a \"final blow\" to some poor countries.</p> <p>\"It threatens to undermine all our achievements and all our progress,\" Ban told a UN meeting. </p> <p>\"Our progress in eradicating poverty and disease. Our efforts to fight climate change and promote development. To ensure that people have enough to eat. It could be the final blow that many of the poorest of the world's poor simply cannot survive.\" </p> <p>Emerging economies have been particularly hard hit by the crisis, forcing many to dip into their foreign exchange reserves to defend their currencies and financial systems. </p> <p>The IMF is in negotiation with several countries to provide emergency loans and the list of countries asking for help is growing quickly. Pakistan has had to go cap in hand to the IMF, but supposedly strong economies in the developing world such as Brazil, Turkey and South Africa have also had to turn to the IMF.</p> <p>Officials in Washington said those economies that qualify for a proposed new liquidity fund from the IMF could be eligible for an unusually high level of financing. Although the details of the package were not finalised, the plan,, which may offer countries up to five times their IMF quota, could be approved as soon as next week.</p> <p>It would allow certain emerging market economies to exchange local currencies for US dollars to ease short-term credit strains.</p> <p>Iceland, where the financial system has all but collapsed, yesterday called on the IMF for $2bn (\u00a31.25bn) to help fix its banking system, restart currency trading and soften the blow from the global downturn.</p> <p>Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, said that governments must do whatever is needed, and without delay, to limit damage to the global economy from the financial turmoil. Wen signalled that China would back France's drive for tougher global financial rules at next month's summit in Washington.</p> <p>President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said he expected concrete decisions to come out of the Washington talks, which had to address the underlying causes of the crisis, not just their effects.</p> <p>\"We have all understood that it will not be possible to simply meet and have a discussion. We need to turn it into a decision-making forum,\" he said in Beijing. \"It is simply impossible to talk about taxes and the financial crisis without talking about currencies and the way they interact. All of this is of course going to be discussed.\"</p> <p>Sarkozy has told China that he fears the US would be content if the summit produced \"principles and generalities\", according to a French presidential official.</p> <p>Wen said the right balance had to be struck between regulation and innovation, but added: \"We need financial innovation, but we need financial oversight even more.\"</p> <p>In his remarks, Bush warned against taking a protectionist turn in response to the current financial turbulence, saying free markets and free trade were fundamental to long-term economic growth.</p> <p>\"These policies have shown themselves time and time again to be the surest path to creating jobs, increasing commerce, and fostering progress,\" Bush said. \"And this moment of global economic uncertainty would be precisely the wrong time to reject such proven methods for creating prosperity and hope.\"</p>",
  "<p>A legal battle being fought in Spain's national court is a sign of just how deep crusading magistrate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltasar_Garz%C3%B3n\">Baltasar Garz\u00f3n</a> has struck into the national psyche by accusing the Franco dictatorship of crimes against humanity.</p> <p>State prosecutors at the court are determined to stop Garz\u00f3n. He is a modern-day <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%C3%A1s_de_Torquemada\">Torquemada</a>, they claim, intent on creating a fresh Spanish inquisition. </p> <p>Why is there such an unprecedented fuss? It is, after all, hardly novel that Garz\u00f3n should investigate human rights abuses. Previously he has even chased abusers from other countries. That is why Chile's General Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London a decade ago. That is why Adolfo Scilingo, an Argentine Navy captain who tossed political opponents out of airplanes, was sent to a Spanish jail. Garz\u00f3n likes to push the law to new limits. He wins some \u2013 like Scilingo \u2013 and loses others \u2013 like Pinochet. </p> <p>Many observers, however, have looked on in wonder at his willingness to tackle abusers from Latin America and elsewhere while ignoring Spain itself. In the last couple of years Spanish police have helped in the global search for Aribert Heim, a Nazi concentration camp doctor sought by Austria. That only made the general unwillingness to study Spain's own track record from the same period seem stranger. </p> <p>Now the human rights chickens are coming home to roost. In a complex \u2013 critics would say fantastical \u2013 document, Judge Garz\u00f3n has argued that Franco and his people are responsible for the systematic killing or disappearance of 114,000 people. While their opponents in the Spanish civil war were guilty of similar crimes (and let us not forget the 6,832 priests, nuns and monks they murdered), justice for their attrocities had already been meted by General Franco himself during a 36-year dictatorship. Franco's own crimes, however, have never been investigated.</p> <p>\"Those who lost the war never sent a single bill to the dictator,\" argues I\u00f1aki Gabilondo, one of Spain's best-known left-leaning journalists. \"National reconcilation (after his death) was, above all, a gigantic act of pardon by the losers (of the civil war).\"</p> <p>An amnesty law approved after Franco's 1975 death, Garz\u00f3n says, does not count. If Hitler's Nazi henchmen could be tried using international law at Nuremberg, he adds, then the same rules can be applied to events of a few years earlier (the Spanish civil war ran from 1936 to 1939, the year that the second world war broke out).</p> <p>Already he has appointed a team of investigators who \u2013 unlike historians who complain archives are difficult to get to \u2013 can now simply flash a police warrant every time they want to get to the paperwork.</p> <p>Garz\u00f3n has named 35 suspected human rights criminals, including Franco. They are all former generals or ministers. All, conveniently, are dead. That means he can launch his enquiry without putting anyone on trial. That, perhaps, could have been too traumatic for Spaniards. Had he started this just five years ago he might have arrested Franco's brother-in-law and former right-hand man, Ram\u00f3n Serrano Su\u00f1er, who was still alive. </p> <p>Garzon's move tackles several sacred cows. First of all, it shatters a post-Franco political consensus that can best be summed up as: \"Don't mention the war.\" Secondly, it challenges those on the right who still claim that Francoism was not that bad. It is not uncommon, in certain circles in Madrid, to hear it argued that his was not a \"dictadura\" but a \"dictablanda\" \u2013 a \"soft\", or benign, sort of dictatorship.</p> <p>Finally, the judge's investigation obliges Spaniards to ask uncomfortable questions about who Franco's helpers and supporters really were. Were they just the ministers and generals? Were they also the judges, prosecutors and policemen who enforced his laws? Were they the civil servants, soldiers and others who worked directly for the regime? What about the teachers, university professors, writers or journalists who made their own compromises with the regime, even if they did not like it? Who were the people who used to pack into the Plaza de Oriente in Madrid to listen to Franco's speeches? Who, in fact, remained completely untarred by the Francoist brush? What, some might ask, did their own parents or grandparents do \u2013 and why? History, people may discover, is never created in just black and white.</p> <p>It is difficult to predict where it will all go from here. Garz\u00f3n may still be stopped in his tracks. Should he be? Or is it time the dirty laundry of Francoism was finally hung out to dry, so no-one can argue that both he, and those who ran his regime, were not that bad really?</p>",
  "<p>The current financial crisis has been manufactured in company boardrooms. Its authors include the best executive directors, non-executive directors, accountants, lawyers and sundry business advisers. Most directors received profit-related remuneration. Innocent stakeholders lost savings, investments, jobs, homes and pensions. </p> <p>Among many reckless acts, bank executives used depositors' and investors' monies to place clever bets on the movement of interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices and virtually everything else. They borrowed heavily. At some banks, for every \u00a31 of shareholder investment, directors borrowed \u00a333 \u2013 inother words, they had a leverage ratio of 33:1, meaning that just over 3% of the company was financed by long-term funds. This meant that if the value of the bank's assets declined by just over 3%, the bank would technically be bankrupt. Many banks had even higher leverage ratios. With the full approval of auditors, most of them reported toxic assets as good. They also moved more than $5tn of assets and liabilities off balance sheet. All this helped to improve earnings and maximise the profit related remuneration of bank directors. There is a clear conflict of interests between the interests of directors and wellbeing of business stakeholders. It is difficult to see how the directors exercised reasonable care, skill and diligence in devising their policies.</p> <p>Successive governments have been too keen to shield their friends from public scrutiny. No independent inspectors were appointed to investigate failures at <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3077718.stm\">Polly Peck</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/may/31/uknews\">The Accident Group</a>, Bank of Credit and Commerce International (<a href=\"http://visar.csustan.edu/aaba/BCCICOVERUP.pdf\">BCCI</a>), or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/may/26/business.politics\">Versailles Group Plc</a>. Such is the hold of deregulationist philosophies that the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) does not even have an in-house unit to investigate major corporate abuses. It outsources that function to major <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/07/creditcrunch.banking\">auditing firms</a>, the very firms which have given a clean bill of health to the accounts of distressed banks. </p> <p>Abuses by big names in the City have been flagged before. For example, a 1997 government report on <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/34910.stm\">Guinness plc</a> found \"firstly, the cynical disregard of laws and regulations; secondly the cavalier misuse of company monies; thirdly, a contempt for truth and common honesty. All these in a part of the City which was thought respectable\". Yet little has been done to enhance people's rights against executive abuses.</p> <p>Section 171 of the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2006/pdf/ukpga_20060046_en.pdf\">Companies Act</a> 2006 states that a director must act in good faith, promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members [shareholders] as a whole and in doing so have regard (among other matters) to \"(a) the likely consequences of any decision in the long term, (b) the interests of the company's employees, (c) the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others, (d) the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment, (e) the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and (f) the need to act fairly as between members of the company\".</p> <p>Lawyers could use this law to argue that directors have been negligent and harmed the interests of stakeholders. However, directors do not owe a 'duty of care' to any individual shareholder, employee, depositor or any other stakeholder. The interests of stakeholders, such as employees, pension schemes members, suppliers, customers and local communities have been subordinated to the interests of the company. Though the shareholders may bring class actions to sue directors for negligence, the law does not empower employees, pension scheme members or depositors to do the same. Neither an individual shareholder nor any other stakeholder can sue <a href=\"http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/casebook/Resources/CAPARO_1.pdf\">auditors</a> as they only owe a 'duty of care' to the company, as a legal person. Auditors enjoy too many <a href=\"http://visar.csustan.edu/aaba/RacetotheBottom.pdf\">liability shields</a> and can escape liability even after admitting negligence.</p> <p>The UK is ill-equipped to investigate the current financial crisis, or prosecute its architects. Individual stakeholders have lost property, but are not in a position to sue negligent directors and auditors. Thus the UK state is failing in its duty to protect the property rights of its citizens. There is an urgent need to abandon deregulationist policies and revise corporate laws.</p>"
