  "<p>Boris Johnson's hair is looking uncharacteristically tamed. \"Yes, I was told to get a haircut,\" says London's mayor glumly, in the manner of Just William submitting to the unfathomable protocol of grown-ups. \"Because I had to go on Richard &amp; Judy yesterday.\" </p> <p>The mournful look barely lasts a second, though, before lifting when I ask how his city is coming along. \"In cracking shape, thank you. Getting better every day. More and more shipshape. And generally ready for action.\" Johnson offers his impressions of his new job with exuberant delight. </p> <p>\"It's bigger than I'd expected. Much, much bigger. But also better. It's a very big job. Bigger, more challenging, more intellectually challenging than anything I've ever done. I didn't really know what it would be like. But I could tell it was a wonderful job. I remember years ago, when [Michael] Heseltine first started rabbiting on about it, thinking, golly, that would be a fantastic thing to do.\" </p> <p>A memorable feature of the mayoral election campaign was the contrast between Johnson's enthusiasm and the jaded air of the incumbent, Ken Livingstone. Observers were in no doubt that Johnson really wanted the job. After 100 days in office, however, some are still not entirely clear why. Johnson never produced a general manifesto, and city hall staff, accustomed to the ideological clarity of purpose of his predecessor, have privately expressed confusion about exactly what their new boss wants to do with the capital. So which words would define his vision for London? </p> <p>\"Happy, green, clean, safe. Yeah. And pioneering on the whole environmental agenda, taking that stuff seriously, making London the centre of the new global green revolution. You know, if you want to ... flog a new green idea, then London should be the place where it happens.\" </p> <p>So why has he not yet appointed a deputy mayor for the environment? \"Because we're going to appoint a superb environmental adviser very shortly.\" By law, the mayor is required to set out a timetable for strategies on air quality, municipal waste, ambient noise and climate change - none of which has yet materialised. </p> <p>When I ask when these will be announced, the reply is halting. \"We will be building up a ... a ... strategy ... and, you know, revising a lot of the targets over the, er, next few months. But I'm sticking to our general desire to reduce CO2 by 60% by 2025. And, you know, you're going to see some really fantastic things on cycling. I would say to people, add that adjective - I mean, no, cycling's not an adjective, it's a participle - add that participle, OK? It's going to be clean, green, safe - and cycling.\" </p> <p>It will still be motoring, though. Livingstone's pounds 25 daily charge for gas guzzlers was quickly cancelled by Johnson, and this week plans to pedestrianise part of Parliament Square, and order 60 hydrogen vehicles, were also scrapped. Less than a month ago, Johnson had described hydrogen as an \"exciting fuel of the future\", but couldn't be quizzed on his cancellation of the order yesterday, because he is now on holiday. </p> <p>There have been changes elsewhere. Two of his major appointments have had to resign. Ray Lewis's claims about his professional credentials were exposed as false, and the deputy chief of staff, James McGrath, stood down after suggesting that Caribbean immigrants unhappy with London under Johnson should \"go, if they don't like it here\". \"I don't think James was a racist,\" Johnson says quietly. \"But I think his comments were capable of perpetual misconstruction, which was not going to be helpful.\" </p> <p>Having himself once described black people as \"piccaninnies\" with \"watermelon smiles\", I wonder what made McGrath's comments so offensive to Johnson as to require his resignation. </p> <p>\"Well,\" he says, looking pained, \"I just think it would have made things very difficult for him, it would have sent out a wrong signal to a large, erm ... you know, chunk of the London population, that we weren't here to work for all of them.\" He brightens, and swishes a fist through the air. \"And we're here to work for everybody in London, OK?\" </p> <p>Is the mayor relaxed about the large number of senior women's job losses at city hall? \"But I believe passionately in the government of women.\" Presumably he can't therefore have been happy to see so many senior female staff sacked? \"Well. Er, I'm not quite sure it's true. I dispute your premise.\" </p> <p>Even his first deputy mayor did not dispute that all five senior female directors had been dismissed and their replacements were male. \"Nothing would make me happier than to be able to boast a top team that was more diverse,\" Tim Parker told the assembly. But there weren't any women, according to Parker, who were up to the job. </p> <p>\"Look,\" Johnson says, \"I'm a great believer in organisations that are run by women. The Spectator under me was a 'feminocracy'.\" How does he explain their wholesale dismissal then? \"Well, you know ...\" I'm not sure I do, I confess. Can't he help? \"Well, I'd have to look at the numbers. But my impression is that we are a completely equal opportunities employer. And I'm absolutely determined to remain so.\" </p> <p>The minutiae of interminable meetings, he agrees, can sometimes be a drag. \"I think meetings can ... sometimes it's a bit like running in a dream, you get that heavy feeling in your legs, and you feel you can hardly move, it's just like treacle. And we've got some things done quickly. But some things you've got to bang at, and then you've got to bang again, and keep banging. So when you do come into government - and I'm in government now, you know, I'm running this thing, you find actually how much energy it needs to push things along. And you need good people around you, to help you push it along.\" </p> <p>One concern has been the degree of delegation to deputies and advisers. On taking office, Johnson handed responsibility for all major planning decisions to a deputy mayor and, when quizzed by assembly members last month, he could not name a single one made since he came to power. Tony Travers, of the London School of Economics, warned in the Evening Standard this week about the \"risk of a polycentric administration\" and a \"confused mayoral voice\". </p> <p>Johnson's view? \"It's perfectly true that when I came in, just as a short term measure - I mean, you know what planning's like, it's mega stuff, you've got to look at big balsa wood models of new developments and you've got to get your head around the arguments. So I said listen, I've got a lot to do in the next couple of months, so I did temporarily delegate my powers - but I'll be taking them back soon. Planning is central to my vision for London. If you're going to build a wonderful site in the middle of London ... and you've got this epic opportunity to build something that's going to last for 100 years, then for God's sake put something on it that's going to be worth looking at.\" </p> <p>In his book, Blink, Malcolm Gladwell described research into medical malpractice suits. Researchers recorded hundreds of conversations between doctors and their patients and distorted the recordings to create \"a kind of garble that preserves intonation, pitch and rhythm, but erases content\". They found they could accurately predict the likelihood of a lawsuit- without even knowing what was being said - from the sound of the doctor's voice. </p> <p>It would be fascinating to see a similar study conducted on politicians' speech patterns, because Johnson's are striking. His daredevil panache - he refers to Venezuela's Hugo Chavez as a \"foreign dictator\" - has not been tamed, nor has his irreverence. \"Oh, incessantly\", he laughs, when asked how often he and the Tory leader, David Cameron, talk. \"We're scarcely ever off the phone. In fact I'm going to ring him now. Let's ring Cameron.\" Let's not, his aide interjects. </p> <p>Whenever he's drawn into the measured political discourse, he comes unstuck. \"Using the resources of the Mayor's Fund for London, and the London Development Agency, to start to, you know... encourage a boom in, er... institutions of all kinds, people who are providing, um, um...\" </p> <p>Whereas Gordon Brown's fluency in the language of policy seems to alienate voters, Johnson's words don't so much tell a story as paint a picture - of irrepressible positivity and enthusiasm. Flaws or contradictions are swept aside by the sheer force of his optimism. It's hugely engaging, and so far, people appear to like it. Maybe the likelihood of being elected, like being sued, lies not in what leaders say but how they sound. </p> <p>\"So what haven't I told you?\" he calls out as I'm leaving. \"It is, I promise you, the most wonderful job.\"</p>",
  "<p>Russell's explosively imaginative stories explore an adolescent hinterland, gradually unfurling to encompass a more ominous and unaccommodating world. Full of a lively sense of the fantastical, the stories also inhabit a beautifully realised natural environment of starlit skies, phosphorescent caves and abundant animal life. Performance is a dominant theme, from ice-skating apes to the alligators which captivate tourists in the theme park \"Swamplandia!\". These displays mirror the brave face put on by so many of Russell's characters, such as the group of girls raised by wolves who embark on a painful process of re-civilisation at the hands of nuns, hiding their frailties and trying to operate as best they can within socially accepted norms. Meanwhile, feelings of alienation accompany awkwardly expanding bodies and uneasy relationships with often absent parents. As she explores the existential angst of her characters, Russell's injection of a sense of the absurd lends an originality and lightness of touch to this creatively acrobatic debut.</p>",
  "<p>My eyes are either wide because I have just been blinded by the actual science behind flipping a McDonald's burger or because Janette Moran has just told me how much holiday she's taken this year. </p> <p>Moran, a store manager with the multinational burger chain, thought<br>she might use her paid 10-week break (yes, you read that right) to go travelling to India, but instead she pottered around the Canaries for a few weeks before doing up her house and going shopping.</p> <p>Lest you think the 28-year-old from Oldham was pulling the mother of all sickies, this vacation coup was a result of her having worked for McDonald's for 10 years. She goes on to describe what might be the most spectacular works trip ever \u2014 a week in Sydney, where her bosses hired out all of the harbour's restaurants and held a fireworks display for its global managers. </p> <p>Moran manages the Manchester St Ann's Square branch of McDonald's, heading up a staff of 68. She has worked for McDonald's in one form or another since she left school, seeing her through legal executive training at Oldham College and then a law degree at the University of Manchester. </p> <p>Despite her legal aspirations, she was faced with a life-changing decision when it came to entering the workplace. \"The work I was looking at disappointed me, to be honest,\" she says. \"I found it quite boring and it wasn't as involved as I thought it would be. I had been promoted within McDonald's and the wages were very good so I stayed put. Every job I went for had to compete with what I had here.\"</p> <p>Many people might assume that career progression at McDonald's consists of gathering gold stars on your lapel but the well-heeled Moran, whose salary is \"in excess of \u00a330,000\" is living proof that this couldn't be further from the truth. The company invests on average around \u00a315 m in training and development in the UK each year.</p> <p>But, of course, to get where she is now, she had to learn the ropes and as she shows me round the kitchen, she shakes chips, wipes grills and rearranges shelves without missing a beat.</p> <p>It's time for me to take my first foray into fast food. I wash my hands for what seems like the millionth time (the rules say every half an hour) and start to create some of the world's most recognisable fast food. To start with I put the buns in the toaster the wrong way round so one comes out underdone (it is binned). I put too much lettuce (it should be 14g) on the crown (even parts of the bun have names to learn), and I press too hard on the tartare sauce and make a pig's ear of a Filet-O- Fish. I am super-stressed and it's only 11.30am. A girl at my shoulder worriedly asks if I will be here for the lunchtime rush. Moran leads me away and talks me through the new computerised system which tracks orders and shows me how charts are used to show the movement of stock against sales. As we enter her office, I have never been so pleased to leave a kitchen in my life. Not that I would be up to the admin either. I have never heard so many acronyms in my life. FIFOs jostle with BOPs and NABITs and there are so many vital checklists that my eyes nearly start to bleed.</p> <p>Granted, I have barely been here long enough to memorise how long<br>the fries are allowed to stand for before they are ditched, but it seems to me that if anyone deserves a 10-week holiday and a trip to Oz, a McDonald's store manager does. But I'm going home, and I'm lovin' it.</p> <h2>Jobs to go</h2> <p><strong>TGI Fridays</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.tgifridays.co.uk\">tgifridays.co.uk</a><br>Ongoing recruitment</p> <p><strong>Burger King</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.burgerking.co.uk\">burgerking.co.uk</a><br>Various training positions.

  "<p>Mark Watson is a prodigy: sell-out tours, published novelist and panellist on numerous TV shows - and all this at the tender age of 28. In his latest Edinburgh show, Watson attempts to chronicle every thought he has ever had, of which I imagine there are many. Making his name in Edinburgh with his now-legendary, concept-driven experience shows such as Mark Watson (And Friends) Take Control Of The World In 24 Hours and Crap At The Environment, this year sees him trying to capitalise on his previous cult success at the Fringe as he plays the 700-seater Pleasance Grand. It's a pretty large space to fill, but Watson easily has the wit and charisma to do it. </p>",

But some simple tips to stop you blowing your first loan instalment in Fresher's Week will mean you'll have far more fun raving it up with actual friends for the rest of the year.</p> <p>Don't let the accommodation brochures fool you into picking the wrong hall. Being in the action and living in the city centre might have you frothing at the mouth but bear in mind you'll be paying higher rents. </p> <p>You'll also miss out on all the benefits that come with living in a student \"ghetto\", like Fallowfield in Manchester - more students to share books with, cheap bus passes, cheap drinks in student-friendly bars, a big supermarket and so on. There is a reason that these areas exist and besides, ghetto is in now.</p> <p>The debate over whether to go self-catered or catered is a dead duck. As my friend who lived in Owens Park put it, the food in catered halls is \"disgusting\", and she missed almost every meal. Save rent and learn to cook. At first you'll be draining pasta all over the kitchen floor, but be persist and you'll be watching Gordon Ramsay with a discerning eye. </p> <p>My girlfriend in my final year was a canny woman, but even she didn't discover the prime foundation of cheap and potentially lovely dinners until second year - Sainsbury's Basics (or equivalent) tinned tomatoes. Buy spices, herbs, rice and pasta in bulk and source a market to buy fruit, veg and meat and you can eat like a king or queen on \u00a310 a week.</p> <p>Now where to put all this money you're saving? </p> <p>Don't be dazzled by offers such as free MP3 players or CD vouchers. By far the best freebie offered by the banks is NatWest's five-year 16-25 Railcard. You'll spend so much time on trains visiting friends, going to gigs or going home that you'll grow to love their badly upholstered carriages - especially if you're saving a third on every ticket. </p> <p>Also beware student accounts with huge first year overdraft limits; you will end up spending it all. Instead plump for those that increase year on year. You will thank your lucky stars when you have the money to finance a festival or trip abroad with your new friends come the summer. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336353217\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/08/08/AnneHuang_SarahLee220.jpg\" alt=\"Anne Huang\" width=\"220\" height=\"355\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne Huang.

It's a cosmopolitan hub of vibrancy, a melting pot of cultures, a hotspot for trendsetters and ... wallet destroyingly expensive.</p> <p>However there are a number of ways to make sure your finances are in control for your undergrad years and you don't end up living on a loaf of stale bread waiting for the next instalment of your loan to come through.</p> <p>Accommodation is the most important factor to consider, as it will be the biggest expenditure by far. Luckily for me, my university is one of the few in London offering reasonably priced on-campus housing. I was paying around \u00a398 per week for a decent-sized room with en-suite bathroom, internet connection and daily cleaner but prices vary from \u00a386.45 to \u00a3115.64. </p> <p>However you will have to find your own accommodation for the second and third years and expect to pay around \u00a3500-600 per month for rent.</p> <p>I worked at the Student Union bar and had a great time. You get to meet new people, get free beer and get paid. It's a fantastic way of really getting involved on campus and the wage isn't bad either. I was getting \u00a36.03 per hour and working 4-6 hours a week, but of course you can work more if you wish.</p> <p>The cost of living and studying in London is a lot but the advantages outweigh the cost by a mile. Queen Mary's is located in one of the most vibrant areas, a stone's throw from the ever trendy Shoreditch, Brick Lane, Hoxton, only a few minutes from the centre of the city and bursting with opportunities, so start saving your pennies. </p> <p>If you're lucky you might even get to spot Peaches Geldof - she's starting in September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336353218\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/08/08/SadeLaja_SarahLee220.jpg\" alt=\"Sade Laja.

Right from the start you have to budget and work out how much money you are going to spend in a week and what you are going to spend it on. I used to spend no more than \u00a320 a week on food from the supermarket and that held me in good stead for three years.</p> <p>Don't be seduced by credit cards. I knew of students running up \u00a31,000 debts in their first semester on cards that banks readily hand out to new unassuming students.</p> <p>Getting a part-time job is the best way to get some extra cash to pay for nights out, food and other expenses.</p> <p>Starting at the beginning of the year a friend of mine started putting all his small change into a jar whenever he had change in his wallet. Midway through the academic year he emptied the jar and found that he had accumulated \u00a330. Although seemingly not a huge amount, he was low on money for food that week and was able to change the money up at the bank. Simple but effective.</p> <p>Another big expense for students is textbooks, which can cost anything up to an eye watering \u00a350 each. The best place to buy is online from Amazon. You can buy used textbooks for half the price and the books are usually in good condition . I'll never forget buying one from a bookshop for \u00a350 in my first year, it still hurts.</p> <p>As a university student, a TV is a luxury, not a must-have item. I was able to last for three years without having one, and I didn't miss it at all. Students still have to pay over \u00a3100 for a TV licence, although a number of students at my university chose not to, and subsequently spent the whole year terrified of being caught.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336353219\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/08/08/MaryBabalola_SarahLee220.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Babalola\" width=\"220\" height=\"385\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Babalola. Photograph: Sarah Lee</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Mary Babalola, graduate, Goldsmith's College, London</strong><br>Top tip: Live with your parents</p> <p>London is a one of the most cosmopolitan and exciting cities in the world. It is also one of the most expensive. </p> <p>If, like me, you are from London then there's no question - you have to live at home, as the only cost-effective way of staying in the capital.</p> <p>You're still entitled to grants and/or student loans, and you'll suffer less stress and fewer disruptions. You won't need to worry about all the problems that come with moving, like noisy halls of residents, deposits, finding flatmates or dodgy landlords. What's more, you have the emotional support of family and established friends and you still get to do all your local activities. </p> <p>But you do miss out on the full student experience. A lot of people will be living in halls so you'll miss out on that communal living experience with other students and making friends.</p> <p>You'll also have less privacy and freedom. You won't be able to get up to as many shenanigans with your parents and/or siblings around. Plus you still have to abide by house rules and take part in family activities. </p> <p>While studying in London, working is a must and is key to keeping your head afloat of your expenses. This is where London has a distinct advantage over other towns as there are a wider variety of jobs and the pay is higher. But I'd recommend you keep an eye on your tax code and claim a refund for any excess tax paid.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336350249\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1719760388_gdn-spr-080728-es-levene-dogs-04-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>It is, to be brutally honest, not much of a sport: the frantic pursuit of a faintly ridiculous mechanical hare around a sandy track by six skinny dogs. The whole thing is over in less than 30 seconds, and the hare never loses.</p> <p>But it's got something; enough, say, to persuade no less an authority than TS Eliot to argue, in Notes Toward a Definition of Culture, that for a nation's culture to be truly complete it must be composed of the high and the popular variety - of Derby Day at Epsom, the Glorious 12th, and a night at the dogs.</p> <p>Eliot was, admittedly, writing in the late 1940s, when Britain boasted 77 licensed greyhound racing tracks and upwards of 50 million punters would pass through the turnstiles each year. London alone had 33 tracks. This time next week there may be just one.</p> <p>On a moist August evening, Walthamstow stadium in east London is packed. Elderly men in macs scan their race cards, a pencil behind each ear; office parties screech as the winner of the last race is confirmed; tattooed and shaven-headed lads queue amiably for the hotdogs; young dads hoist excited infants on to their shoulders in readiness for the next off; in the posh Paddock Grill there are expensive tans, a designer frock or two and even a white tuxedo. </p> <p>Down by the track, the last half-dozen independent bookies - there were once 50 - and their tic-tac men accept the sheaves of fivers thrust at them by serious-looking blokes clutching crumpled copies of the Racing Post. The bookies gaze skyward for a second, do the sums, scribble the new odds on their boards. There's a hush as the traps are lifted; the dogs flash by in a blur. \"Go on number three! Wake up, five! Go on my son!\"</p> <p>According to the stadium's owners, the Chandler family, next Saturday will see the last dog race at Walthamstow. The venue, by the North Circular and close to the 2012 Olympic site, is worth more as land for housing. As a dog track, the Chandlers claim, it has been steadily mounting losses for the past three years, finishing 2007 \u00a3500,000 in the red. </p> <p>The punters are not happy. \"It's wrong to close it, completely wrong,\" says Nick Steel, on an office outing from Oxford Street. \"This is a real community here, and they're destroying it. Look around you, you've got all sorts. Four- and five-year-old kids jumping up and down; they won't do that in front of a computer screen.\"</p> <p>His colleague, Holly Lieberson, laments the disappearance of \"nearly a century of history. So much of the old East End has already gone; this place shutting down is a tragedy.\" Andrew, a 35-year-old engineer, concedes he was \"not the sort of customer who was ever going to ensure its survival, but when you hear it's going ... It's a side of London I love.\" </p> <p>Andie Pepper has come with her husband, Joe, to show their 20-month daughter Sarah the dogs \"because she isn't going to get the chance to see them here again\". Pepper used to come \"with my grandparents, my parents ... I really will miss it. There's such a buzz here, a real electricity.\"</p> <p>The staff and those whose jobs depend on the place are angrier. \"It'll tear the heart right out of this community, rip it right out. It's a disgrace,\" says Maurice Newman, who has been training dogs to race at Walthamstow for more than 60 years. Corinne Ward, a waitress here since 1986, observes: \"People never retire from the Stow. I've got a colleague in her mid-80s. I just think: what am I going to do with my Saturday night? I love this place.\" </p> <p>The Stow first opened its doors, beneath the pink-and-green neon-lit sign on its imposing - and now Grade II listed - facade, in 1933, seven years after Britain's earliest dog track opened in Belle Vue, Manchester. The sport, descended from the aristocratic pastime of hare coursing, had been imported from the US, where the mechanical hare was invented, around 1912, by an a businessman called Charles Munn.</p> <p>William Chandler began as an illegal bookmaker in the East End, and by the late 1920s was a top-rails bookie - taking bets from the members' enclosure - on racetracks around the country. His main rivals were called William Hill, Jo Coral and Max Parker, who went on to found Ladbrokes. The new sport had potential: Belle Vue's first curious crowd of 1,700 shot up to 16,000 for the second meeting, and by the end of 1920s, annual attendances at the country's mushrooming licensed tracks were totalling 17 million. </p> <p>The dogs, as they still are, were a laugh: a little bit dodgy, a little bit gaudy; raffish, louche, welcoming. They offered quick thrills cheap. An excuse for a good night out, plus a bit of a punt. Above all, they were proudly working-class.</p> <p>The early appeal of greyhound racing to Britain's working men is easy to explain, says Lord David Lipsey, a Labour peer and chairman of the British Greyhound Racing Board: \"At that time, a working man couldn't get a legal bet except at a dog track - he couldn't get credit at a bookmakers. Greyhound tracks were also a lot cheaper to get into than racetracks, and far easier to get to.\" The sport, Lipsey says, is \"deeply embedded in a certain kind of cultural life.\" Even today, entrance to a weekday night of racing in the Popular Enclosure at Walthamstow is yours for a quid (and free for under-15s). </p> <p>Posher people did go, of course. Illustrious owners in the early days included Viscountess Maidstone and the Duchess of Sutherland. Churchill was an occasional visitor and as late as 1968 the winner of the Greyhound Derby at the White City stadium, where crowds of 100,000 were not uncommon, was owned by Prince Philip. But much of the pleasure for the nobs, one suspects, was in knowing they were slumming it a bit. (In the 1980s, likewise, City boys, yuppies, assorted media types adored the dogs, but very much in a spirit of irony).</p> <p>Now, though, the sport has been in gentle decline for a long time. Annual attendances hover just above the three million mark; before its planned closure was announced, Walthamstow, which regularly used to host 15,000 punters, was often down to maybe a 10th of that. \"The problems started with the arrival of the betting shop in the mid-1960s,\" says Lipsey. \"The popularity of the sport as a bet remains remarkably strong; greyhound racing accounts for about a fifth of all betting shop turnover. The problem is that fewer people are actually going to the tracks to bet - now you can walk down to the high street bookies or place your bets on the internet or even through your television set.\" </p> <p>Changes to the betting laws have not help: high street bookmakers can now stay open until 10pm, and there is no longer a tax advantage to be had from betting at trackside. Gamblers may be betting \u00a32.5bn a year on the dogs, but they're not doing it in the stadiums. The turnover at Walthamstow's government-owned MicroTote betting windows was \u00a313m in 2000; last year it was \u00a38.7m.</p> <p>But mainly, the dogs have suffered from the sheer abundance of alternative leisure pursuits available to 21st-century city-dwellers. Dougie Tyler celebrates his 90th birthday this October, and has been running a book at Walthamstow's trackside since June 1946 (\"It keep me young,\" he says. \"At home I feel 89, when I'm taking bets I feel 70\".) When he first started, \"Your choice for a night out was the dogs, the cinema or the dance hall. What can't young people do these days? Though mostly they sit in front of the telly and push buttons.\"</p> <p>There is still hope, though. More than 1,400 pubs closed in Britain last year, and the dogs are certainly doing no worse than them. And other traditionally working-class sports have hurdled the class barrier. \"The problem,\" says Lipsey, \"is that these days there's no longer any money in cloth caps on the terraces. You have to offer a 'leisure experience' - fine dining and excellent wines. Rather like the Labour party, you have to attract a more prosperous constituency. Football has done it.\"</p> <p>Those greyhound tracks that have decided to invest in improved, more modern facilities have seen their attendances surge, Lipsey argues. \"They're faring modestly well - tracks like Yarmouth, where you could now eat your dinner off the floor, and Peterborough, Poole, Sheffield, Belle Vue. There are new tracks being considered, too.\"</p> <p>Because the innate attractions of a night at the dogs are still there, he insists. \"You can have a modest flutter, a couple of quid. The action is fast and furious. You don't have to move from your seat in the restaurant. If you take it seriously, the betting side is a science of amazing proportions. And the animals are, of course, absolutely wonderful.\"</p> <p>And crucially, he adds, animal welfare, long a blemish on the sport's name, \"is now well on its way to being resolved; 80% plus of retired racing dogs are now rehomed, that's north of 8,000 animals a year, and the others are put down by a licensed vet. You really can't run a modern leisure business if there's any hint of cruelty attached to it. I can now look at myself in the mirror without feeling ashamed, which I couldn't five years ago.\"</p> <p>So what of Walthamstow's future in all this? Ricky Holloway, a balding and buoyant trainer who has been coming to the track since he was five, says the place's losses have been made to look much worse than they are by its owners, who \"just wanted out, and didn't particularly want there to be any greyhound racing in Walthamstow after they have gone\".</p> <p>The track, he swears, \"has never made a loss. And just look around you: there's clearly a massive desire for this venue; for people round here the Stow is Walthamstow. Attendances have been up for the last 18 months. It needs to be brought up to date a bit, and it needs to be managed better. There are 800 jobs here; it could do with half that.\" </p> <p>Holloway is masterminding an enthusiastic \"Save Our Stow\" campaign that has found backers - an Australian businessman and two local stockbrokers - for a last-minute bid to buy out the development company the Chandlers sold to this year. Part of the rescue package includes investment in a health club and maybe a casino, turning the venue into top-of-the-line day and evening leisure centre. </p> <p>He claims the deal, to which the housing association that would end up building on the site is \"very sympathetic\", is \"90% done.\" Perhaps the Stow won't go to the dogs quite yet.</p>",
  "<h2>End of the line for \u00a3100m Oyster card contract</h2> <p>The contract to run London's \u00a3100m-a-year Oyster card system is to be terminated in an attempt to save money. Transport for London said it had given notice to TranSys, the consortium running the contract to maintain and develop Oyster cards, used by millions of people to pay for travel in the capital. TfL said the announcement had nothing to do with recent problems that led to ticket barriers at underground stations across the capital being kept open. A statement said mayor Boris Johnson and TfL were convinced a new contract would deliver enhanced services for less money. <br><strong>Matthew Taylor</strong></p> <h2>More time for questioning of shooting suspect</h2> <p>Police were yesterday given more time to question a 19-year-old man over the death of an innocent bystander killed in a convenience store shooting. Ryan Bravo, 18, was shot in the back when he was caught up in an apparent gang fight at a Costcutters in Walworth, south-east London, on Wednesday. Officers were still hunting the two intended victims, who they believe could hold the key to identifying the gunman and his accomplices. The pair rushed into the store to escape the moped-riding gang.

The elderly woman was given her treat as part of her care home's 'make a wish' initiative in which staff try to make residents' dreams come true, Jim'll Fix It style. An employee at the Woodland House home in St Austell, Cornwall, dutifully donned the undergarment to grant the woman's wish.

  "<p>As is now the received wisdom, Stephen Merchant was the reason for The Office and Extras' global success. Everyone knows that with double acts, the one in the glasses is the clever one. Stepping out of the shadow of the all-conquering Ricky Gervais, Merchant has been beavering away on the open-mic circuit honing his stand-up skills, and now he's embarking on a low-key tour. His set is both cerebral and physical, dealing with his natural awkwardness and outsider status while poking fun at his massive success.

  "<p>Outdoor screenings are a tricky proposition in this country at the best of times. The weather is the major gamble, but - at worst - you have to contend with the noise of planes, traffic and other punters. Monte Hellman's great 1971 existential road movie, then, is perhaps the ideal choice for such an environment. It has dialogue that is mumbled rather than spoken, while the plot is virtually non-existent, so you don't have to struggle to follow it. Artist Richard Prince selected this movie and it's not hard to see why, as it both fetishises and deconstructs American iconography in much the same way as his own work. It's more a moving picture, a window to Route 66 Americana, and one that should feel wonderfully incongruous in a setting as genteel as Kensington Gardens.</p>",
  "<h2>Why is the price of oil falling?</h2> <p>Motorists could be forgiven for being confused. Oil prices reached a record $147 a barrel at the start of last month, amid speculation that they were on course to breach $200 a barrel over the next few months. But after a sharp fall over recent weeks, which has shaved $25 off the cost of a barrel of crude, there is talk of oil prices tumbling below $100.</p> <p>A number of factors have been at play. First, there is growing concern over the state of the global economy. The US is either in recession or close to it; so are Britain and the Eurozone. Even the fast-growing economies of the developing world -China and India - have come off the boil as the effects of the year-long credit crunch have rippled around the world. The price of oil, like that for any commodity, is affected by demand for it, and projected demand has fallen as growth prospects for 2009 have been pared back. There have also been signs of a pick-up in supply from Opec, the production cartel, in response to the surge in oil prices. Lower demand plus higher supply equals lower prices.</p> <p>Second, there has been the ebbing away of some of the geopolitical and weather-related factors that have been underpinning oil prices, such as fears of a nuclear stand-off between the US and Iran, supply disruption in Nigeria, and a devastating hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Third, financial developments have been helpful. Oil is priced in US dollars and there tends to be an inverse relationship between oil prices and the greenback; when the dollar goes down, oil prices go up as suppliers seek to ensure they get the same amount of money for their crude once the proceeds are converted into their own currencies. The opposite happens when the dollar strengthens, and in recent weeks it has risen against the euro as fears have grown over the state of the EU economy.</p> <p>Last, oil is no longer flavour of the month for hedge funds. Speculation drove prices up, but now that the economic backdrop has darkened, speculation is helping to drive them down.<br><strong>Larry Elliott</strong></p> <h2>What is Nice?</h2> <p>Nice is the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, established in 1999 in order to end the \"NHS postcode lottery\", which had meant that patients in some areas got access to expensive medicines, paid for by the taxpayer, while equally deserving patients in other areas didn't. </p> <p>For obvious reasons, there would be no point in the NHS funding treatments that didn't work, however little they cost, so Nice conducts clinical appraisals of drugs and other treatments to find out if they are cost effective. A cheap drug that works well would get an automatic all clear because it would provide good value for taxpayers' money.</p> <p>The difficulty comes when Nice finds a drug that is effective, but expensive - which happened this week when Professor Peter Littlejohns, the institute's clinical director, gave a preliminary decision (still subject to appeal) to reject state funding for Sutent and three other drugs that delay the progression of advanced kidney cancer by several months. </p> <p>Littlejohns did not dispute that hundreds of patients could benefit if the NHS funded these drugs, but his decision was based on the fact that they cost \u00a320,000 to \u00a335,000 a patient. </p> <p>Nice uses a yardstick called Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) - how much it would cost to secure an extra year of healthy life by providing a new medicine - to measure whether a drug gives value for money. All four cancer drugs failed the test. However much the patients affected might appreciate a few months of respite, the cost in QALYs was six times too high.</p> <p>Whenever the institute decides against a drug, it is bombarded with criticism from doctors, patients and the pharmaceutical companies that had hoped to profit from the NHS. It seems Nice has a distinctly nasty job.<br><strong>John Carvel</strong></p> <h2>Why was Frankie Gavin sent home?</h2> <p>Frankie Gavin isn't the first boxer to fail to make the weight so close to his dream date. But unlike your everyday pugilist, what Gavin has lost can't be replicated later in a London ring. As the Beijing games kicked off with a spectacular opening ceremony yesterday, Gavin was back home, 3lb (1.4kg) over the 60kg lightweight limit that would have allowed him entry into the Olympic ring.</p> <p>Eight years ago, in Sydney, heavyweight Audley Harrison won gold for Britain; in Athens in 2004, Amir Khan won silver in the lightweight division. At their respective games, they were the only British boxers, and excitement at their achievement led to an increase in investment. </p> <p>Since January 2007, the eight fighters in the British team have received \u00a375,000 each year from UK Sport, the distributor of national lottery funds, to help them win medals. The money covers everything from travel to nutritionists, which makes it all the more worrying that he is not still in Beijing.</p> <p>Three pounds is not that much weight. Had he worn the official team uniform and marched around the Bird's Nest Stadium during last night's opening ceremony, he might have lost that 3lbs, such was the heat and humidity. </p> <p>But therein lies the problem. Gavin had tried to lose weight, but his body could not lose anymore. The scheduling was against him too - between bouts at last November's World Amateur Championships, he skipped, hit the pads and ran to lose weight. He would not have been able to do that in Beijing as there wasn't enough time between bouts.</p> <p>People will point fingers, ask if someone was to blame, but perhaps it was just nature, playing a knockout blow. <br><strong>Michael Phillips</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Tuesday August 12 2008. In the section 'Why was Frankie Gavin sent home?', we said the reason was his failure, by 3kg (1.4lb), to make the required weight for his competition. This conversion was the wrong way round. He failed, as the same piece said later, by 3lb, which is approximately 1.4kg. One kilogram is equivalent to 2.205 pounds. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Whatever else is said about tomorrow's Community Shield match no one will call it a showcase. The goods on display are not objects of fascination. Peter Crouch is the single major signing by either team and with all due regard to the forward, who has returned to Fratton Park after a six-year absence, he cannot be classified as exotica. Manchester United, for the time being at least, can live contentedly with the squad that won the Premier League and Champions League, several of whom are injured or ill at present.</p> <p>The transfer market has usually been a promotional device, whipping up interest and season-ticket sales. But not this summer. Without splurges at Sunderland, Fulham and Tottenham there would be redundancies for the office staff who register footballers. The current state of affairs must be disorientating for a wheeler-dealer such as Harry Redknapp, who might now be buttonholing passers-by to reminisce about January 2006, when he bought almost a team's worth of players and sold nearly as many.</p> <p>Even last season there were overtones of perpetual revolution. Of the line-up that won the FA Cup final three months ago, Sylvain Distin, Hermann Hreidarsson, John Utaka, Sulley Muntari and Lassana Diarra were all in their first season at the club. Inter's offer of \u00a312.7m for Muntari was too generous to reject, but Redknapp more or less has the squad that kept Portsmouth in the top half of the table. Although he would have preferred an upgrade, the team is not in desperate need of reshaping.</p> <p>Redknapp will be unhappy that a global credit crunch has found its way to Fratton Park and it is understandable that he wants a younger centre-half on the books, even if the attempt to sign Younes Kaboul from Tottenham appears to have gone into suspended animation. He should not expect condolences from his peers around the country. The Portsmouth manager will be considered fortunate by other managers since plenty of progress was made by Redknapp while the fiscal going was still good.</p> <p>In the January transfer window, for instance, Jermain Defoe came from White Hart Lane at the realistic and highly affordable price of \u00a37.5m. He may not contribute enough to the match as a whole, but the striker does score. His ineligibility for the FA Cup, following an appearance in Tottenham's third-round replay with Reading, excluded him from the glory of Wembley. Starting with an equaliser on his debut against Chelsea, however, he scored eight goals in a dozen Premier League appearances for Portsmouth.</p> <p>Now he has the assistance of Crouch. It may be the corniest of partnerships but that combination, of tall striker and nippy runner, is the type of clich\u00e9 with enduring appeal because defenders struggle to cope. In addition, of course, Crouch has many goals of his own and is no rudimentary battering ram. Redknapp, whatever the restrictions now being encountered, developed Portsmouth greatly while he had the means to do so.</p> <p>All that remains, in the short term, is to tap his own experience and see how much nearer the elite he can take a side that, whether he likes it or not, has an established air. Incongruous as it may appear, there is a temporary similarity between Redknapp and Sir Alex Ferguson. The transfer window does not close until the end of this month and frenetic trading could be conducted before then, but United have not been in the thick of the marketplace.</p> <p>There has been nothing yet to whet the appetite of supporters, but they have no cause to be bored, not after the retention of the Premier League and the return to Old Trafford of the European Cup. A rueful United will also reflect that they spent a lot of money without making any impact whatsoever. Carlos T\u00e9vez was already perceived as a United player so the cost of turning the loan of the West Ham player into a permanent transfer hardly registered with the public.</p> <p>Ferguson's aim, temporarily at least, is to set an entirely familiar group of footballers in the direction of a third consecutive title. Despite the debt dumped into the club's accounts, the Glazers have appreciated that it is in their own interests to protect United's standing and the outlay in the transfer market has been far from miserly. So imposing is the squad that the manager is taxed to improve on it. Where does he locate a rival club prepared to let him have an elite player?</p> <p>United could do with a centre-forward and the lone-striker system employed to such effect may have reflected limitations as well as tactical planning. It makes perfect sense, in that context, to believe that efforts to take Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham will intensify soon. Not even Ferguson, however, can be utterly sure of getting his own way.</p> <p>There is a slight awkwardness for United. They must wonder whether Cristiano Ronaldo can conceivably have consecutive seasons at so productive a level. No immediate answer will come either to the question of whether he will go on being absorbed by life at United. The assertions of commitment come far too long after the start of the furore over the possible switch to Real Madrid. As if that did not suffice, Ferguson is yet to learn how much time it will take for the Portuguese to regain fitness following knee surgery.</p> <p>On top of that, transition has to be controlled as United scale down their dependence on the veterans Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs. The goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, 38 in October, also intends this to be his last campaign at Old Trafford. The sides may seem stable tomorrow, but change, in the end, is an inevitability rather than an option.</p>",
  "<p>He is tailed by autograph-hunters, makes groups of girls collapse into red-faced giggles and has the world's media hanging on his every word. He was even picked out by television cameras during last night's opening ceremony - for someone unknown in Britain until this year, Tom Daley is rapidly becoming a global star.</p> <p>The 14-year-old from Plymouth begins his quest for two gold medals with his partner Blake Aldridge in the 10m synchronised pairs diving on Monday morning British time, but such was the clamour to speak to him at a press conference yesterday it appears interest in the event will extend way beyond these shores. America, Canada and Australia in particular have all warmed to his fascinating story.</p> <p>Daley is already huge in China - he guaranteed Olympic qualification by finishing seventh in the World Cup in Beijing earlier this year and diving is a popular sport here - but he is wide-eyed, chipper and full of youthful charm, and a medal on Monday would make him an early contender for the face of the Games.</p> <p>\"I've had people come up and recognise me in the streets and around the Athletes' Village,\" Daley said. \"It's weird. Really weird. When you're little you always dream of being that person, the one getting recognised wherever he goes.\" </p> <p>His age allows him to speak modestly about his ambitions. \"I'm here for the experience, I'm not expecting to win anything. I'd rather work hard for London 2012 and win a medal there. I just want to go out there and have some fun. If I do something wrong this time, that's OK, I'll learn from it and take it on to 2012.\"</p> <p>For all Daley's understatement, the GB performance director, Steve Foley, believes that his events - after the synchronised pairs on Monday, Daley has to wait until Friday week to begin competing in the individual competition - are \"wide open\". In every other format, the Chinese are expected to dominate. Fortunately, Daley appears to be an absolute natural at dealing with the pressure. </p> <p>He also managed to please his sponsors yesterday, discreetly name-dropping several firms into his patter. When asked by a newsman from Montreal whether he regarded the Canadian diver Alexandre Despatie as a hero, Daley's answer was an exquisitely diplomatic \"yes\".</p> <p>Asked whether he felt the atmosphere in the Olympic Village reminded him of a school disco, he replied: \"I don't know. I don't go to school very often, but I do go when I can.\" Everybody laughed, but he was only half-joking. </p> <p>Naturally there were times when his polish slipped and it was easier to remember his actual age. His enthusiastic teenage slang was one reminder. \"It's absolutely massive being in the Village, just awesome, since arriving it's been absolutely phenomenal.\" Daley, who had just had his photo taken with Rafael Nadal, and breakfasted with Jamie Murray, was as star-struck as any teenager would be in the surroundings of the Village. He had, he revealed, also been taking advice from Sir Steve Redgrave (\"thanks to Team Visa\") on how to cope with the sleeplessness he suffers before big competitions. Soon he will be taking tips from Nadal on how to handle groupies. </p> <p>For now he has been spending his free time on other pursuits: printing stamps with his face on and sending postcards to his family, or surfing the internet in his room (\"beautifully furnished by B&amp;Q\"). His family party - some 12 people - are flying out this weekend. Until then he has the company of his team-mates. Daley is rooming with Aldridge, who, at the age of 26, is also competing in his first Olympics. Like the rest of the team you sense Aldridge is enthused and bemused by Daley rather than put out. </p> <p>However Aldridge feels, though, he'll have to get used to it. Daley is a born star, charismatic, handsome, and talented. If he handles pressure on the diving platform half as well as he does in front of a hundred or so journalists, he'll be a phenomenon.</p>",
  "<p>Sports competition and politics are separate, China insisted this week, an impression faintly undermined by the presence of more than 80 heads of state at last night's opening ceremony, and the gathering suspicion that Beijing 2008 is shaping up to be one of the most political Games in modern Olympic history. </p> <p>In the past few days alone, we have heard George W Bush - somewhat miscast as the world's Jiminy Cricket - condemn the Chinese government's human rights record in the strongest terms of his presidency, just hours before Team USA revealed their flag-bearer would be the track star Lopez Lomong, a Sudanese refugee. The co-founder of Team Darfur, Joey Cheek, an Olympic gold medallist himself, had his visa revoked, while the very air that hangs over the Chinese capital seemed to have become a battle between environmentalists and the meteoric rise of the Chinese economy. </p> <p>At ground level, Free Tibet protesters have echoed the dissent that dogged the Olympic flame's progress across the world before being bundled away by police. During last night's spectacular the immediate area surrounding the Olympic Park was eerily clear, the thousands of sightseeing Beijing locals who had thronged it in recent days penned back to a more manageable distance. These scenes lie out of shot of the TV cameras for now, but the question of how long the images can remain controlled looms larger by the hour.</p> <p>Peter Norman, the Australian sprinter who stood in solidarity as Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their gloved fists that historic night in Mexico in 1968, said before he died: \"Once you've earned that right to stand on that podium, you've got that square metre of the world that belongs to you. What you do with it is up to you within limits.\" This coming fortnight the world will discover where China deems those limits to lie, as athletes consider whether to flout the aggressively re-emphasised Section 51 of the Olympic charter, which states that \"no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas\".</p> <p>Even without overt protest, it might be difficult to say where the sport ends and the politics begin. Already the rivalry between the United States and China has an echo of Cold War days, when the medals chase seemed cast as an extension of the arms race. So invested with expectation is tomorrow's China-USA basketball clash that one can only hope it doesn't shape up as a modern skew on the notorious gold medal game at the 1972 Munich Games, which saw the United States lose to the Soviet Union after a controversial period of extra-time that left even the official scorekeeper refusing to sign the scoresheet. Whatever tomorrow's result, it will be watched in person by both Bush and the president of China, Hu Jintao.</p> <p>Just as big ticket football matches are increasingly co-opted as a backdrop for corporate hospitality, so the Olympics can feel like a plot device in the global power struggle. Hu will hold talks with Bush tomorrow - before the game - but over the past few days has had bilateral meetings with the presidents of Vietnam, Algeria, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste, Belarus, Montenegro, Laos, Serbia and Brazil, and Kim Jong-il's No2. The Dear Leader was a notable no-show, as was Pervez Musharraf, the impeachment-threatened Pakistan president, who cancelled at the eleventh hour. Somewhere in the Beijing Games' vast organisational structure, someone must have sighed with relief. At least it was one less minefield for the placement</p> <p>There is simply no space to cover the spider's web of tensions between the leaders waving from the VIP seats last night, with relations ranging from the expediently cordial to the openly poisonous. </p> <p>Were Olympics ever thus? Certainly they were in the ancient world, where the sacred truce for the duration of the Games meant Olympia was often a setting for d\u00e9tente. An ancient statue of Pantarces of Elis honoured not just his victory in the equestrian events but the fact he had used the Games period to broker peace between the Achaeans and the Elians and secured the freedom of both sides' prisoners of war. (Team GB's equestrian hopefuls have a slightly clearer schedule.) </p> <p>As for the modern Olympic story, how often it has seemed ineluctably political. Berlin, Munich, Mexico, Moscow, Los Angeles... the world has witnessed individual actions taking on vast political resonance, as in the case of Smith and Carlos, or political forces snuffing out the individual, as in the case of the murdered Israeli athletes. Even the torch - that fabled symbol of peace - is not what it seems, a faux-ancient tradition confected for Adolf Hitler's Berlin Games and filmed by Leni Riefenstahl for her propagandist Olympia. Against such histories it is impossible to predict how the Beijing narrative will unfold. But on the evidence so far, it's unlikely to be a quiet one.</p>",
  "<p>Are we obsessed with stars? It is a common complaint that no straight play can now succeed in the West End without a big name. And Jonathan Miller has led from the front in attacking our theatre's fixation with celebrity and the casting of \"the man from Doctor Who\" as Hamlet. Yet the issue is more complex than it appears. And I found something cheering in the fact that an RSC Hamlet this week became front-page news. Even the BBC's Ten O'Clock News, not noted for its devotion to culture, contained a first-night report from Stratford's Courtyard Theatre.</p> <p>I share some of Miller's distaste for our celebrity culture, which at times has had a negative effect on our theatre. The most ludicrous example was Madonna's sold-out appearance in 2002 in a very poor David Williamson play, Up For Grabs: a triumph of hype over experience. There is also something exploitative about the use of superannuated sports stars and ex-TV newscasters in pantomime. And I am told that provincial theatre managers won't look at a touring play unless it's got a selling name: when it does, as with Nigel Havers in Rebecca, it tends to clean up.</p> <p>Yet there are positive sides to our star worship, which is not as new as we like to think. For as long as I can remember the commercial theatre has depended on the names above the title: the real problem today is not a reliance on stars but the unwillingness of big names to make a long-term commitment. The blunt truth, however, is that our theatre has gained more than it has lost from the alliance between star names and living writers.</p> <p>A turning point was reached in 1957 when Laurence Olivier appeared in Osborne's The Entertainer at the Royal Court. This was when the acting establishment joined forces with a dynamic new movement; and, where Olivier led, Richardson, Gielgud, and many others followed. And, if today people are going to the West End to see David Eldridge's Under the Blue Sky because of Catherine Tate or Joanna Murray-Smith's The Female of the Species because of Eileen Atkins, I see nothing wrong with that.</p> <p>What's at issue today is what constitutes a \"star\". Traditionally, it was someone who had paid their theatrical dues and possessed their own built-in spotlight. Today, it is a far more flexible term covering anyone who has achieved fame through TV or movies. But it would be absurd to deny that actors now inhabit a multimedia world or that they acquire an added lustre through exposure to the camera. It is fascinating, in fact, to see actors like Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and David Suchet returning to the stage with the extra glow that comes from global fame.</p> <p>One can now add David Tennant to that list. And if this week's Doctor Who-haa over his Hamlet proved anything, it is not that the star system is inherently corrupting but that theatre in the modern world has to be an event. An \"event\" can take many forms. It can be a magnum opus like the recent RSC History Cycle. But it can equally well be any new production by Rupert Goold whose controversial Six Characters in Search of an Author sails into the West End this autumn. And whatever companies like Complicite, Kneehigh or Cheek by Jowl do next constitutes a major happening.</p> <p>We are living, in short, in a complex, pluralistic world where Simon McBurney, Emma Rice, Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod, who run the above companies, are as much stars as anyone else. What they, and others, have proved is that there is little room today for the routine, the repetitive and the banal: what Peter Brook once called \"deadly theatre\". And if, as this week's reaction to Tennant showed, there is a fascination with stars, it is simply another way of saying that a modern audience craves something out of the ordinary for its initial outlay. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:michael.billington@theguardian.com\">michael.billington@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>More than \u00a313bn has been wiped off the profits of the UK's major banks in the year since the credit crunch began. But, in contrast to the US, none of their executives have paid the price.</p> <p>As the half-yearly bank reporting season drew to a close yesterday with the historic loss reported by Royal Bank of Scotland, the havoc inflicted on the banks was illustrated by the dramatic fall in profits.</p> <p>On the anniversary of the day the credit crunch began with a $150bn (\u00a375bn) injection of funds into the global markets by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve, banks are no longer defending high profits from irate customers but apologising to shareholders for poor performance.</p> <p>John Varley, chief executive of Barclays, which reported a 33% fall in profits, admitted this week that shareholders had \"endured a lot\". His counterpart at RBS went further yesterday with a full-blown apology.</p> <p>The only London-listed bank to report higher profits was Standard Chartered, which focuses on emerging markets. Profits at Lloyds TSB and HBOS were down 70%, they were off about a third at Barclays and HSBC, and all but wiped out at Alliance &amp; Leicester. RBS and the state-owned Northern Rock both made losses. </p> <p>But all are stronger in regulatory terms. RBS, Barclays, HBOS and Bradford &amp; Bingley have raised \u00a320bn of fresh funds, while the taxpayer has poured \u00a33bn into Northern Rock.</p> <p>One of the biggest shareholders in the City, Legal &amp; General, has deemed it \"curious\" that more UK bank bosses have not shared the fate of some of their US counterparts. </p> <p>The chief executives of Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Wachovia and Bear Stearns, which suffered a near collapse, have all been replaced. So too has the boss of Switzerland's biggest bank, UBS.</p> <p>In the UK, Adam Applegarth left as chief executive of Northern Rock along with other directors, while Bradford &amp; Bingley lost its chief executive, Steven Crawshaw, through ill health.</p> <p>But Sir Fred Goodwin, chief executive of RBS, was defending his position yesterday while Andy Hornby at HBOS insisted he had not considered his position even though most of the bank's shareholders shunned its \u00a34bn cash call. HSBC's Michael Geoghegan put his head on the line last year after an unprecedented profits warning caused by the US sub-prime mortgage crisis but asked for three years to turn the situation around.</p> <p>In the US, the pattern is different. Stan O'Neal took the top job at Merrill Lynch at the end of 2002, while Chuck Prince stepped up to that role at Citigroup in 2003, both succeeding bosses whose reputations had been tarnished by scandals emerging from the stockmarket boom of the late 1990s. But both O'Neal and Prince leave with their reputations in shreds. </p> <p>O'Neal, the first African American to run a Wall Street bank, resigned shortly after Merrill Lynch disclosed almost $8bn of credit crunch liabilities in October. Despite presiding over the biggest quarterly loss in Merrill's 93-year history, his retirement will be cushioned by a payoff of about $160m.</p> <p>Prince quit under pressure in November after a $5.9bn write-off related to the credit crunch, losses which have since ballooned to $40bn. Prince, whose defence appeared to be that he was only doing what the entire industry was doing, walked away with $40m. Vikram Pandit, his replacement, is selling or winding down some $400bn of the firm's assets and cut 14,000 jobs worldwide since the start of the year.</p> <p>UBS has written off more than $37bn of sub-prime assets and its chief executive, Peter Wuffli, was among the first to go in July last year.</p> <p>Change is taking longer in the Britain. RBS, the target of most shareholder concern, is seeking three new non-executive directors to bolster its board. One of them is expected to become senior independent director and eventually chairman.</p> <p>Mamoun Tazi, an analyst at broker MF Global, suggested that UK bosses could not sleep easy yet. \"The financial sector crisis is now spilling into the real economy. It's not out of the woods.\"</p>",

  "<p>Appropriately enough, Steve Carell's grandfather was instrumental in the development of the cathode ray tube, until recently a standard fixture of the average American TV set. The same might be said of his grandson. After starting out in The Dana Carvey Show in 1996, Carell clocked up over 300 appearances on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, where his average-Joe looks provided a deceptive frame for his spontaneous satire. Those looks caught on quickly: he wasn't a risqu\u00e9 goof like Mike Myers, a rubber-faced devil like Jim Carrey or a buffoon like Will Ferrell. And when he landed the role as the endearingly hangdog Michael Scott, Scranton's David Brent in the US remake of The Office, he really began to dominate the TV landscape winning Emmys, Golden Globes and MTV awards. </p> <p>In the movies, however, things haven't been so smooth. He made an impact in Bruce Almighty (2003) and Anchorman (2004) but it was his breakout hit, The 40 Year-Old Virgin, in which he excelled as the title character, infusing a 2D nerd with a soulful integrity. He was officially a new comedy sensation, but the film that followed - the Bruce sequel Evan Almighty - bombed at the box office, and if it wasn't for his subtle work as a gay philosophy teacher in the sleeper hit Little Miss Sunshine, it may have finished him.</p> <p>Still, Hollywood is willing to take a chance on Steve Carell. Which is how he's ended up in a big-budget remake of Get Smart, the kitsch Mel Brooks-produced 60s TV series about a secret US government agency called CONTROL that was permanently in combat with an eastern European outfit called KAOS. Following in the late Don Adams' po-faced performance as agent Maxwell Smart, Carell is just perfect, a terrific, deadpan clown who proves his suitability for the role by meeting us at the film's downtown LA set in a grey suit, with a warm smile, a handshake and great big burnt hole where the back of his trousers used to be. </p> <p>\"Without giving too much away,\" he says apologetically, \"there are certain action sequences in this movie that take away most of the seat of my pants, because they're so violent. And all that's left is my shiny behind.\" He pauses, thinking about the famous agony he endured in The 40 Year-Old Virgin. \"I didn't have to have it waxed, though.\" </p> <p>In an hour or so, Carell will be back out on the street for the film's climactic chase. The president of the United States is attending a concert where KAOS terrorists have planted a bomb, and Maxwell has to stop them. Aiding him on this mission are his Little Miss Sunshine co-star Alan Arkin, as the boss of CONTROL, and the beautiful Anne Hathaway as his sidekick, Agent 99. You'd expect this sort of capering around from Will Ferrell, but it seems a bit energetic for the bookish Carell. Indeed, it's telling that his so-called \"action\" figure from 40 Year-Old Virgin did nothing at all, except bark \"KELLY CLARKSON!\" or \"HER BREASTS FELT LIKE BAGS OF SAND\" when you pressed a button. So how weird is it for him, coming from a comedy background? </p> <p>\"It's an adventure, I guess,\" he shrugs. \"Because not in a million years would I ever have imagined hanging off the side of the car, or jumping off a moving airplane.\"</p> <p>Weirdly for a funny guy, Carell is a calming presence in the room. He has a low-key, playful wit about him that makes him a rarity: a comedian you might actually want to spend some time with. He's quick, sharp and intelligent, but above all he simply seems nice. Which is lovely. However, one question hanging over Get Smart is whether or not it's relevant in a world where terrorism is once more a brutal reality. Haven't times changed? \"I think times have changed, yes,\" he nods, \"and yet they have stayed more the same than some people realise - look at North Korea. There is a lot of anxiety in the world today, in terms of terrorism and in terms of other countries' nuclear capabilities. It's very relevant still. I think it subsided for a while and, internationally, people started to have a false sense of security, but now there's a very real threat, to everybody. So while it isn't a specific cold war mentality, there is a sense of danger in the world right now, which I think this story plays into. But it's not something we ever mock or make fun of. I don't think the script ever pokes fun at the global situation; it just uses it to propel the story.\"</p> <p>The story itself, which Carell had a hand in shaping, is more Casino Royale than Austin Powers, with Smart becoming an agent and having to prove himself to his peers: the snotty 99 and the rather more supportive 23 (Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson). But, quite frankly, when the director is Peter Segal, the man behind Naked Gun 33 1/3, it's not going to be Shakespeare. \"It's more of an origins story,\" says Carell, \"about how Maxwell came to become an agent. So we find out a bit more about what led him to become a spy in the first place. He's someone who's by-the-book, straitlaced and incredibly driven. And proficient. He is smart, and he does have abilities, but they're sometimes counter-intuitive. He's not a bumbling Clouseau sort of character because I feel - personally - that that's well-trodden territory.\"</p> <p>It's an interesting distinction, because, significantly, Carell's role models aren't larger-than-life funnymen; they're character actors like Arkin or - more pertinently - Clouseau himself, Peter Sellers: \"Performers,\" he explains, \"who never indicate anything about themselves as actors. They don't comment on how funny they think anything is, they just play convincing characters. They're completely believable, regardless of how broadly they play those characters. You just buy the fact that those people exist in the world.\"</p> <p>And hopefully, given Get Smart's successful $38m opening weekend in the US, Carell will get a few more chances to pursue that style of comedy. As for the future of The Office, though, he remains blank. Will he walk away, as Gervais did? And will the public let him? \"I have no idea,\" he says, \"I try not to predetermine. Ricky actually planned to do as many episodes as he did, then walked away, so that was a disciplined decision on his part. He did as many as he felt were viable and cared to do. I think that shows a lot of confidence and integrity. I respect him very much.\"</p> <p>For now, Carell is simply taking it all in his stride, just as he takes sprinting down the street with his arse hanging out, and grappling The Rock for a living. \"It's all surreal,\" he muses. \"Just the last couple of years has been surreal. The fact that I'm even employed is surreal!\"</p> <p>And with that, Carell returns to the set, showing a quick flash of his boxer-shorted buttocks.</p> <p>\"I have to go and show people my butt more,\" he grins. \"It's no thrill, believe me.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Get Smart is out on August 22</p> <h2>All about Steve</h2> <p><strong>The Daily Show</strong></p> <p> Carell would do anything for Jon Stewart. He once drank enough alcohol to make him vomit, after calling Antonio Banderas \"a sexy, sexy man\". </p> <p><strong>Anchorman</strong></p> <p>Retarded weatherman Brick Tamland was Carell's finest hour, eating candles, loving lamp and offering free passes to the \"pants party\". </p> <p><strong>Bruce Almighty </strong></p> <p>Jim Carrey was the star but Carell stole the show as his tongue-tied TV news rival, performing facial acrobatics with sound effects to match. </p> <p><strong>The 40 Year-Old Virgin </strong></p> <p>A clearly painful real-life chest-waxing took Carell the extra distance in this comic tale of a middle-aged nerd's late sexual awakening. </p> <p><strong>The Office (US) </strong></p> <p>Carell ferried Ricky Gervais's hit sitcom across the Atlantic, turning Slough's David Brent into Michael Scott of Scranton, PA. </p> <p><strong>Little Miss Sunshine </strong></p> <p>Proving his versatility, Carell charmed the arthouse set with this Sundance breakout indie, playing a bearded, gay, suicidal philosophy scholar. </p> <p><strong>Evan Almighty </strong></p> <p>The flop sequel to Bruce Almighty, this kid-skewed comedy found Carell's compromised Congressman become a latter-day Noah. </p> <p><strong>Get Smart </strong></p> <p>The cold war TV skit finally gets a big-screen makeover, with Carell following 60s icon Don Adams as bungling secret agent Maxwell Smart.</p>",
  "<p>Looking down at our plates the other night, I heard the dread words. The ones I knew were coming one day. The sound of the apocalypse.</p> <p>\"Is it OK to eat fish?\" Sophie looked up from her haddock. \"I mean, ethically?\"</p> <p>Now I'm a carnivore forced into vegetarian clothing while at home, and the compromise is that we eat fish. But killing any creature is a big compromise for a life-long veggie like Sophie, and I don't like anything that threatens our peace treaty. I don't like hearing that fish just wanna have fun, or that every fish has a mummy. At the same time, I've read my share of eco-armageddon stuff on the marine environment. Like Taras Grescoe's new book, Bottomfeeders, a stunning expose of human folly with fishing around the globe. I know all that, but I can't help myself: giving up on fish would be totally gutting, and perhaps unnecessary.</p> <p>So I answered firmly, \"Yes.\" The sort of voice, I hoped, that delivered certainty, and brooked no argument.</p> <p>A week later, an old friend, Chris Bax, got in touch: \"Would I be interested in doing a weekend course in coastal food foraging? There's a few other people coming. We'll hunt in rock pools, go out in a boat, make sushi . . .\" I saw my opportunity. No longer a slave to trawl nets and industrial ocean hoovers, I would salvage dignity for myself and the fish. The nobility of the hunt would be mine, plus some Yorkshire sushi.</p> <p>Chris met me and the other participants at midday on the quayside at Whitby where we jumped aboard John Whitton's boat, Never Can Tella.</p> <p>This is a tough bit of coast for boats: in the late 19th century there was one year that had at least one wreck a day for all 365 days. No wonder Bram Stoker chose such a red-blooded spot to have Dracula shipwrecked. Storms can close the harbour mouth for long periods in winter, but we were lucky with the weather, chugging out past the rows of fish and chip shops, in sunshine. </p> <p>John and his mate Tony showed me the morning's catch: several lobsters, velvet crabs, edible crabs and a huge octopus whose feeding habits seemed straight out of Bram Stoker too. \"They drape themselves over the pot, stick their tentacles inside and crush the lobster, then pick out the bits.\"</p> <p>\"Will you eat him?\"</p> <p>John shook his head. Apparently no one eats or buys octopus. I don't blame them: my own experience is of rubbery snacks around the Med. Chris, however, took it and dropped it into our goodie box along with a couple of lobsters and a selection of crabs. Up front in the tiny cabin, John introduced me to the technology that is devastating our sealife. Simple and cheap pieces of software that coordinate the boat's position and show fish shoals. These are the tools of modern fishing, and the result is frequently total madness: vast quantities of fish discarded because they are the wrong species - 87,000 tonnes of haddock alone every year for the past 40 years in the North Sea, huge vessels scooping up edible sardines or Antarctic krill to feed to farmed salmon (along with chicken feathers and feet, artificial colourants and antibiotics), and the remorseless hunt for bluefin tuna that is sending populations the way of all cod. John's boat may be a tiny day-sailer, but it still has the same devastating technology. A tap of a key and we had a 3-D representation of the sea bed showing a first world war wreck poking up.</p> <p>\"With this, we can drop our lines down the side of it and drift away with the tide.\"</p> <p>The difference between us and a super-trawler was in our catching gear. Where they have a lethal array of nets and electrified stunning equipment, we were holding 5ft long rods, wooden Scarborough reels and rigs of feathered lures. It could not be simpler. John gave me the lowdown on the complex angling technique known as jigging. \"You drop the line to the bottom, then jig the lure up and down.\"</p> <p>But I didn't get to the bottom. The lure went over the side and descended halfway, about 60ft, then it stopped and started doing its own jigging.</p> <p>\"Mackerel,\" said John, \"Reel 'em in.\"</p> <p>Leaning over the gunwale, I could see them coming up: sudden surges of quicksilver, flashing down there in the green depths. One fell off but two landed on the deck, smacking at the boards with their tails, their backs so beautifully marked that I squatted there for a long while gazing at them in awe. I hadn't caught a mackerel since I was 14 and long forgotten the sheer magic of that feeling.</p> <p>The others were hooking into the shoal too, and soon our tub was filling up. \"I'm going to shift the boat,\" said John, \"Otherwise we'll never get through to the cod and whiting lower down. Reel in.\"</p> <p>Back in the cabin, I asked about cod: were the press stories of collapsed population true?</p> <p>\"Yes,\" he said emphatically. \"Things are getting worse for cod. The only population doing well is lobster.\"</p> <p>This might seem like a tiny piece of good news, but as Taras Grescoe points out in his book, lobsters are doing fine since fish populations collapsed. Seaweed beds have grown and the lobster thrives in them with few predators to bother it. Whitby is doing well from shellfish, if not the traditional cod. The truth is that the world's oceans are filling up with crustaceans and slime.</p> <p>As if to reinforce the bad news, we were suddenly into a patch of cod and whiting, most of them too small to eat. John had us put them all back. Nevertheless, after three hours we had a tub containing two cod, half a dozen whiting and about a hundred mackerel. Chris looked relieved. \"I have been out and caught nothing,\" he admitted. \"But this is good - we can do some sushi.\"</p> <p>By dinnertime we were over at the camp, a few miles up the coast, raising a good fire. Chris, a trained chef as well as bushcraft expert, taught me how to fillet and trim for sushi, then prepare crab. John, one of the other participants, was tenderising octopus with a stick. Richard, a forester from Lancashire, was learning how to deal with lobster while Rose, a sculptor, chose to go and collect a salad of wild leaves. I will remember many tastes from that night: the delicate flavours of raw mackerel, and the buttery beauty of a fresh lobster, but most surprising was the octopus - a creature thrown in the UK's fishery bin. Not a hint of car tyre, just sweet and tender.</p> <p>Next day we were not so fortunate with the weather, but the food possibilities never stopped. A walk down to the sea through Oakrigg woods was punctuated by stops for plants: herb bennet - very like cloves; woundwort - very good antiseptic; a clutch of different mushrooms, all edible.</p> <p>The beach was at Port Mulgrave, a tiny former mining cove up the coast from Whitby, now little visited, but full of interesting flora and fauna. Despite frequent rain squalls we pressed on, collecting seaweeds and whelks, even a lobster that had strayed from deeper waters. Chris passed me a piece of kelp to nibble on and washed the sand from a load of laver, a seaweed that is used in the nori of Japanese sushi. \"In Wales they use it in laver bread - oats, seaweed and bacon fat - we'll try it for breakfast. There are no inedible seaweeds in Britain so you just check the water quality, then try them!\"</p> <p>There is a kind of enthusiasm that only real foodies can generate, and that of the wild food foodie is particularly infectious. Chris has that type of creative imagination that can run to extravagances like woodlouse pizza, or innovations such as a fish smoker made from a Quality Street tin and some oak shavings. That night we drank Chris's home-made elderflower champagne and sipped his hawthorn blossom liqueur before our feast. The final morning was all seaweed recipes and things to do with whelks.</p> <p>I came away with all sorts of new skills and knowledge, some confidence about gathering and handling coastal food, plus several mackerel that the local farmer had kept in his fridge for me. We even learned how to call roe deer, bringing a large buck bouncing out the woods. Then we realised he wasn't fish and sent him back. I'm not sure I went home with an answer to Sophie's question. But the catching of it, by hand and personally, was positively saintly in comparison with the industrial sea hoovers of this world. My next task is to dig up some horseradish, then the dream of Yorkshire sushi will become reality.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Chris Bax (07914 290083, <a href=\"http://www.tastethewild.co.uk\">tastethewild.co.uk</a>) runs courses in wild food, including coastal foods.

  "<p>Three miles from the nearest shooting butt, a covey of red grouse springs from the heather, nine birds cackling their alarm call \"Go-back, go-back\" as they whirr towards the Pennine horizon.</p> <p>Beyond it, for them, lies an unusual certainty: they will not end up on London dinner plates next Tuesday. For these are birds which live on one of Britain's few grouse moors barred to guns and subject to new, and controversial, \"multi-objective\" management.</p> <p>In stark contrast to famous neighbouring shoots, 53 sq km (20.5 sq mls) of northern Cumbria will be silent apart from birdsong on the Glorious Twelfth. While the shooters' Moorland Association forecasts a mixed bag elsewhere, Geltsdale will be host to ramblers, birds of prey and undisturbed grouse.</p> <p>\"Shooting doesn't play a part here any more,\" says Dr Pat Thompson, uplands conservation officer of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which now occupies the old hunting lodge at Stagsike, with the coat of arms of the aristocratic Lowther family carved above its door. An ally among Geltsdale's previous owners, plus a war chest of legacies, allowed the society to buy the moor before taking over management full-time seven years ago.</p> <p>The inroad into territory long controlled by grouse shooters, including the ruling Maktoum family of Dubai, has upped the stakes in the arguments which swirl round grouse moors, their biodiversity and the threat to birds of prey as the Twelfth approaches every year. Geltsdale's management was attacked this spring by the Countryside Alliance, after a Natural England survey found that the estate had lower bird populations on average than 16 shooting moors in Cumbria. The RSPB hit back that the survey was too small and overlooked factors such as overgrazing which reduced lapwings before the new management approach got under way.</p> <p>\"And what we're doing here is new - and complex,\" says Thompson. \"We don't want a monoculture of heather or of grouse. Many people have a potential interest in the uplands: farmers, foresters, keepers, wildlife enthusiasts, tourists. We are working towards a sustainable way of managing Geltsdale to meet those different needs.\" The RSPB is aggressive to grouse-shooters on the issue of birds of prey, whose unexplained corpses still turn up on shooting moors, but otherwise wants to prove the worth of Geltsdale rather than attack conventional moors. Thompson says: \"We recognise the biodiversity achievements of many shooting moors, and like it or not, their style of intensive grouse moor management is not going to go away.</p> <p>\"But the Moorland Association's own figure, of shooting contributing \u00a312.5m a year to the rural economy, is hardly staggering, compared to the huge economic potential of tourism.\" Geltsdale attracts visitors from the neighbouring honeypots of Hadrian's Wall and the Lake District, and provides jobs - in tenant farming and conservation management - on a comparable scale to a similar-sized grouse moor. But on the reserve, Natural England found low numbers of golden plover, lapwings and other moorland birds, compared with Cumbrian shooting estates. \"Well, we've recorded 96 species breeding on Geltsdale this year,\" says Dave O'Hara, reserve warden for the last five years.</p> <p>The society says its aim is greater diversity rather than ramping up greater numbers of individual species, as can happen with grouse on shooting moors. The approach is in keeping, says O'Hara, with the diverse history of Geltsdale.</p> <p>\"This was the coal mine manager's house,\" he says, as a pair of bizarrely suburban-looking semis appears in the middle of nowhere. \"That slight banking on the moor edge above was the tramway from the mine where Stephenson's Rocket worked in its 'retirement'.\" </p> <p>The Geltsdale experiment is working alongside a second upland study, of a defunct grouse moor in Scotland, where ground-nesting birds have flourished alongside an increase in their predator, the hen harrier. Langholm Moor on the southern border of Dumfries and Galloway is now being managed with an eye to restoring limited grouse-shooting, dependent on the safeguarding of the birds of prey. The project is backed by the RSPB as well as the estate of the Duke of Buccleugh, which owns the land, and the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust. </p> <p>Prof Des Thompson, policy and advice manager for Scottish Natural Heritage, said: \"This is robust science and it is important that this sort of monitoring continues.\" Back on Geltsdale, Pat Thompson agrees. He said: \"The question was posed by David Miliband when he was environment secretary: what are the uplands for? Our moor is going to be part of the answer.\"</p>",
  "<p>Several members of the US basketball team revealed yesterday that the NBA is no longer the be-all and end-all for them and that some would consider moving away from what has long been considered the pre-eminent league in the world.</p> <p>\"Things are changing really fast. I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket, business-wise,\" said LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers and one of the US squad due to start against China tomorrow, which is aiming to improve on the bronze from Athens in 2004. \"Can I imagine leaving the NBA? Yes, it's a possibility.\" </p> <p>Those comments came just days after James let it be known he would consider moving to Europe if a club would pay him $50m (\u00a325m) a year, and it has emerged that he is not the only one. \"It has certainly been one of the hot topics of our training camp,\" added Jason Kidd, the US point guard. \"The rest of the world is getting better at basketball and the money is there. That is why we have already seen some guys make the move overseas.\" </p> <p>A number of NBA players have accepted offers to play elsewhere in recent months, the most prominent being Josh Childress, who opted out of his deal with the Atlanta Hawks and signed with the Greek club Olympicos for $20m after tax over three years - far in excess of what the Hawks were willing to offer him. </p> <p>European clubs have no salary cap rules, and it now seems some of them have no inhibitions when it comes to spending. So far, none of the league's biggest stars has been tempted but some observers, Childress among them, believe it is an inevitability. James, for one, has long spoken of his desire to transform himself into a global brand. \"I am sure there is a team that would be willing to do it [pay James $50m a year],\" Childress said. \"That just shows the game of basketball is global now and not just about the US. Hopefully, we would be on the same team.\" </p> <p>Ironically, talk of players like James and his Olympic team-mate Kobe Bryant, winner of the NBA's most valuable player award last season, moving comes at a time when the league's commissioner David Stern has spoken of his desire to expand into Europe, with teams playing in cities such as London, Moscow and Barcelona.</p> <p> Typically, a league spokesman waxed sceptical this week about the prospect of players heading overseas: \" I don't want to say it is much ado about nothing, but it's not something we're losing sleep about.\"</p>",
  "<p>One year on from recording top-12 finishes in all four major championships Justin Rose has found this year a bit of a let-down. It is safe to assume that a tie for 36th at the Masters, a missed cut in the US Open and a tie for 70th on his emotional return to Royal Birkdale for the Open Championship last month was not what the 28-year old Englishman had in mind after the excitement of 2007.</p> <p>Things are looking up again, though. After a brilliant second round of 67 over a fearsomely difficult course here the former prodigy is level par and only one shot off the lead held by the American JB Holmes in the 90th USPGA Championship. Amid much carnage Rose made four birdies and dropped only one shot, on the 18th hole, which was his ninth.</p> <p>This was, however, a round built upon proficiency on the wickedly sloping greens that have provoked so much consternation already this week. On the back nine Rose used the shortest club in his bag a mere 11 times. The question now is whether that sort of scrambling is a sustainable formula for success at a level of the game where Rose has been found wanting on more than one occasion.</p> <p>\"Tiger [Woods] has made winning majors look very easy and, therefore, for some of the younger guys, it's easy to get frustrated when you are not doing it yourself,\" he said. \"I look at someone like Nick Faldo, who didn't win his first major until he was 30, so I know there is no rush and we all have to start somewhere.</p> <p>\"Still, you can't always keep saying, 'Well, I'm gaining experience, I'm gaining experience.' There is a time to start believing, this is the time to do it and the time is now. It's a bit of a Catch-22. I think experience in majors is essential, just the environment, the golf course, and I think the art of patience in majors is the key.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere on the leaderboard Henrik Stenson is the next best European on one over par after Sergio Garc\u00eda finished with a double bogey on the penultimate hole to be two over par. Stenson, the big-hitting former World Match Play champion and third at last month's Open behind Padraig Harrington - who, like Ian Poulter, is five over par so far - would appear to have the ideal game for a course this long and demanding. But even he sounded more than happy to be done for the day.</p> <p>\"It was tough to shoot a good number today,\" he said. \"I was just fighting for par on most holes. It is just so hard to get close to the flags. The pins all seem to be tucked away behind these little humps and ridges.\"</p> <p>Harrington claimed his recent exertions have caught up with him. \"I ran out of steam,\" he said after bogeys on his last two holes for a total of 145. \"It was a struggle. I did my best to be ready for the week but clearly I'm not. The harder I tried the worse it got. I haven't got the focus this week. I'm just not with it.</p> <p>\"Obviously I'm still just having a hangover after winning the Open. You would love to try and go with the flow and that's what you try and do but the harder you try the worse you make it. Certainly that was the case for me.\"</p> <p>Sadly, mention must also be made of the score turned in by Colin Montgomerie. Equalling his previous worst round in a major championship - an 84 at Muirfield in 2002 - the Scot finished on 20 over par and in 150th position. The only players he beat were five American club professionals.</p> <p>\"It was very difficult out there and I made it more so,\" said the eight-time Ryder Cup player, whose weary body language over the closing few holes spoke of his misery more eloquently than any words. \"I got off to a bad start and kept it going. The only consolation is that the putt I holed on the last green was the same one I made in 2004 to clinch the Ryder Cup.</p> <p>\"This was the toughest set-up I have ever seen. It really was most difficult, just very, very severe. I'll just have to go away and regroup and come back again.\"</p> <p>Still, at least he behaved with some sort of dignity in what must have been a difficult situation. \"Colin really struggled on the greens,\" said Jim Furyk, one of his playing companions. \"And it's tough when you get to the point where you know you can't make the cut. He tried his best, though. He hung in there. And he was actually very pleasant to play with today. He handled it like a professional.\"</p> <p>Asked about the Ryder Cup, Montgomerie claimed it was \"the farthest thing\" from his mind. But with only three weeks remaining until a final determination is made, any lingering hope he had of receiving a Faldo wild card must now be gone. It is the end of an era.</p>",
  "<p>Not even an outstandingly prepared and executed Olympic games opening ceremony - and yesterday's spectacular in Beijing was undoubtedly that - can avoid being both magnificent and unsettling at the same time. The extravagant opening is part of the ritual of the games, as well as part of its make-believe, and even on occasion part of its self-delusion too. Yesterday's opening passed the necessary tests not just with flying colours but, courtesy of Zhang Yimou's brilliant choreography, with flying people, flying Olympic rings, a flying globe and, at the flame-lighting climax, a flying Olympic torch-bearer too. Though the opening owed much to Hollywood-style special effects and computer graphics (and perhaps something to Albert Speer), the display was often unmistakably and refreshingly oriental and human too. Confucius has never had a bigger audience than yesterday. A billion or more human beings were reportedly glued to their televisions around the world throughout the whole thing. And, as any producer will confirm, a billion people are never wrong. Anarchic, individualist, contrarian London has a hard act to follow in 2012. </p> <p>Actually it is not the fearsomely disciplined dancing or the precision kitsch, let alone the fireworks, of the Beijing Olympic opening that should make us all keep our enthusiasm reined in and our critical faculties alert - and not even the industrial strength poppet singing her Chinese national song either. Any modern Olympic games, whether it is held in Beijing or London or anywhere else, involves a trade-off between idealism and vested interests - and only the naive can be confident that the idealists have the upper hand in the present International Olympic Committee. The tensions take many forms: commercialism, exclusive broadcasting rights, bureaucracy, corruption, drugs and cheating. Yet in most Olympics, and this one is certain to be no different, nationalism is the vested interest that grates hardest and most visibly. The ideal of open competition among the young people of the world is held hostage by national political interests.</p> <p>As the teams paraded around the Beijing stadium from 204 countries that included Liechtenstein, Guam and Andorra - all of which are recognised as independent for Olympic purposes - it was hard not to speculate about teams from countries such as Tibet, Scotland, Turkish Cyprus or for that matter South Ossetia. Their presence yesterday might have upset the status quo. On such occasions the appearance of global unity only highlights national divisions. Why should the team from Taiwan be required to disguise itself as Chinese Taipei for two weeks while a team from Palestine is rightly welcomed at the games? We all know the answer, but it is a reminder that the Olympics and politics are umbilically linked. And not just in China, either. This week's statement that the UK government has officially targeted a haul of 35 medals in Beijing as the dividend for its \u00a3265m investment in elite competitors at these games is a reminder that people in glass houses should not throw too many stones.</p> <p>Britain will watch the Beijing games with special interest because we are the next hosts. It would be healthy if this engagement could be reflected not just in medals or in grassroots sport, but also in a commitment to restoring a better balance of values to the games. If the Olympic ideal means anything, it ought to mean more priority for human rights, environmental sustainability and openness in the way the games are organised, and less priority for national, commercial and bureaucratic interests. A permanent home - or a home in a middle-ranking country in each of the five continents between which the games can be rotated - is an idea worth exploring. With each Olympics it becomes clearer that the games and the IOC should be reviewed in the interests not of governments and corporations but of sport and people. But if not now, when?</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Prescott got it wrong when he compared Gordon Brown to the master of the Titanic, and so not to blame for the iceberg. The disaster was largely Captain Smith's fault as he declined to steer a more southerly course. The moral for politicians is never compare anyone or anything to the Titanic. It's a hopeless clich\u00e9, and it only makes matters worse.</p> <p>Can't we have some fresh maritime metaphors? \"The government is like the Mary Celeste, adrift on the seas with no-one at the helm.\" Or \"the twin torpedoes of world oil and food prices have slaughtered our standard of living, like innocent passengers on the Lusitania\". Or, \"unexpected gusts of inflationary pressure have sunk the Edmund Fitzgerald\". </p> <p>Well, perhaps not the last, because it would recall Gordon Lightfoot's terrible dirge on the topic, which includes many unsingable lines, including \"as the big freighters go, she was bigger than most\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I've been greatly enjoying High Sobriety, by Alice King (Orion Books, \u00a316.99), the memoir of a distinguished wine writer who, in her own words, \"got a little bit too close to her subject\".</p> <p>Alice is now dry. I met her at lunch the other day and she was full of stories about her boozing days - and some horrible ones too. </p> <p>Like the time she saw her three children cuddled in their stepmother's arms, and as a consequence drank enough gin to refloat the Titanic - or the Edmund Fitzgerald - then told a group of Bordeaux growers loudly and precisely what she thought of their thin, over-priced product.</p> <p>Some years ago she was at a very posh dinner given at his stately pile by a master of wine for a select group of experts. He produced three handsome Georgian decanters brimming with red wine and invited them to guess what it was. </p> <p>After much slurping and sipping and discussion, the table finally agreed that it was a very fine claret - probably three different vintages from the same estate. </p> <p>Then the host revealed what it really was - a bag-in-box Chilean wine. As Alice points out, this shows two things: the power of communal suggestion, and the fact that you can fool even connoisseurs with any old wine provided it's in a nice decanter - a money-saving tip for us all.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> We'll believe in \"Sir\" Richard Branson's space tourism service when it happens. He says he is planning to charge \u00a3100,000 for a trip above the Earth's atmosphere, which makes it only slightly more expensive per mile than a full fare ticket on Virgin Trains. </p> <p>Meanwhile, I feel sorry for anyone trying to book one of these flights, especially if they suffer like reader Janet Byrne, who wanted a ticket from London to Macclesfield on one of Branson's trains. </p> <p>First the voice-recognition software failed to register what she was saying. Then she went online, but the site wouldn't acknowledge her travel card. She finally got through to a human being on the phone, but they couldn't understand her. </p> <p>Finally she conveyed the necessary information and paid by credit card, whereupon she was told they couldn't get the ticket to her on time.</p> <p>In the end, she was ill, couldn't go, and tried to get a refund. But that wasn't possible - because the ticket had been booked for the wrong day. </p> <p>Possibly dozens of space tourists will turn up in the Mojave desert, having had 100 grand whisked from their accounts, only to be told that there has been a problem with the booking, or there are signal problems in the Phobos area, or that owing to equipment shortages they will have to sit on each other's knees.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Trying to work out why we are often such a rude nation these days it struck me that the problem isn't aggression, so much as a belief that the slightest inconvenience is a gross intrusion on our civil liberties. Take the bloke opposite me in the \"quiet coach\" on a train the other day. His iPod was very loud: \"Ka-chunka-chunka\". I pointed out the quiet sign and he said he had no intention of moving. \"I like to sit in the front coach,\" he said, as if that settled the matter.</p> <p>A week ago a group of us were strolling to an Indian restaurant. Suddenly there was this urgent ringing of a bell. A woman on a bike angrily tried to push past. She had a baby in the back seat, and was towing a toddler behind. My wife politely pointed out there was a roadway and she replied, \"I'm not taking my children on the [very bad word] road!\"</p> <p>All right, but that doesn't give you the right to use the pavement as a velodrome, scattering pedestrians who've dared to stray on to your track. What struck me about these two very minor occasions was that the people involved were clearly middle-class. Yobbery seems to be filtering upwards.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The death of Simon Gray lets me reprise a favourite story. He was a close friend of Harold Pinter, a great cricket lover. Once Pinter wrote a poem about his hero Len Hutton. It read, in its entirety \"I saw Hutton in his prime / Another time, another time.\" He sent it to several of his friends.</p> <p>Soon afterwards Pinter and Gray were at the same dinner party and Pinter asked what he thought of the poem. \"I don't know, Harold,\" said Gray. \"I'm afraid I haven't finished it yet.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Family words continue to flood in - more next week, but in the meantime I've been enjoying those euphemisms parents use to cover bodily functions and other embarrassing situations. </p> <p>The Fields, of New Zealand, use \"bonty\" for a bottom. The Bartletts of Brighton used to have a metal potty, so that a pee is the onomatopoeic \"nongynoyng\". The Kenneisons of Manningtree call the plastic bag used for collecting dog's droppings a \"gummer\". This derives from the time in 1993 when the Norwegian environment minister called John Gummer a \"drittsekk\", which means - well, you can probably guess.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The family</strong></p> <p>My two daughters have been hassling us to buy chickens. A neighbour has some, so why not us? Dora, seven, is obsessed. She already has a bedroom full of toy hens and ducks, so the real-life version, in her mind, is the obvious next step. Martha, 10, does not go in for her sister's fluffy excesses, but is right behind her when it comes to proper poultry. Hannah, who has always had aspirations to lead the good life, is egging them on. </p> <p>We grow vegetables and in theory I like the idea of producing more of our own food (eggs, not meat). But I need to be convinced. I tell the girls that chickens, unlike turkeys, are not just for Christmas (they don't find this funny). Like any other pet, they will live for years, will need constant looking-after, and that includes dreary jobs such as cleaning up their muck. </p> <p>But they are not easily deterred. To be honest, I can see the appeal of poultry. Obviously, there are the fresh eggs - you can expect 250 a year from each hen - but chickens have other uses. They will contribute to a healthy garden by eating slugs and will happily gobble up scraps and the remains of meals. Compared to our guineapigs, who bite you, hide from their own shadows and poo in their food dish, there is a point to chickens. </p> <p>So we agree to give it a go, but on the understanding that it will be a trial run. A couple of weeks' probation should do it: if the chickens become a burden in that time, they will just have to go. </p> <p><strong>The training</strong></p> <p>Our chicken-keeping is mostly to be learned on the job. Chickens, according to books, websites and local poultry fanciers, are easy. And once word gets round the village that we are in the market for some, neighbours pitch in with more tips. </p> <p>We visit Will, to see what we can learn from his set up. Like him, we are hoping to let our hens wander round the place when we are in the garden and go into their enclosed run when we are not around. But in the past he has been slack about this and the fox has killed the lot, taking only one away, leaving the rest for Will to clean up.</p> <p>I think of the fox who sunbathes brazenly on our garage roof. Our coop and run, therefore, must be impregnable - not the romantic image we had of free-range fowl wandering our garden, but better than carnage. </p> <p>There are plenty of specialist coop suppliers, though a decent one won't be cheap. Ours is made locally and comes with a little skirt of fencing that is laid horizontally around it to stop predators digging underneath. </p> <p>With the coop in place, we are ready for the chickens. Another neighbour says we don't need a cockerel, unless we are planning to fertilise our eggs for breeding and wake next door at night (it's a myth that they only crow at dawn). Neither, we are advised, should we get novelty breeds such as those with fluffy legs - the hen's equivalent of a cowboy's chaps get filthy in winter and are a breeding ground for mites. Hybrids are recommended because they lay large numbers of eggs, but pure breeds are reputed to be tougher and more disease resistant. Our poultry-fancying friends advise that we should go for the latter.</p> <p>After scanning the small ads, we find a lady in a nearby village with Buff Sussex pullets to sell, who are about one month off \"point of lay\" (18 weeks old). They are a lovely golden colour, with dark collars and wing tips and, according to one book, a perfect breed for beginners. We practise holding Penny and Rosie, hands around each wing so they don't flap. They are hen-size but still make the chirping sound you associate with chicks. The combination has the girls delirious. </p> <p>Betty and Hilda are slightly older and come from a different source - a man who explains that he can tell they are ready to lay because of the deep red colour of their combs and wattles. Betty is a speckled blue-black Cuckoo Marans, Hilda a Light Sussex. </p> <p>We have timed our purchases for the weekend, so we can hang out all day while the chickens get used to their new home. After a night in the coop, we let them out to explore the garden and I find myself warming to them straight away. They are very sociable, the whole gang hanging around if you are weeding the borders (or are they looking for worms?). They don't seem to mind being picked up and cuddled, either, although Dora's over-enthusiasm has got her pecked a few times.</p> <p>At the hen house, a pecking order has been established that seems to have been fairly bloodless. Betty rules the roost, blocking the door when the fancy takes her and always first to the food. But things are relatively harmonious - I peeked in at dusk the other night and they were all cuddled together, daytime differences forgotten. </p> <p>Our first two weeks have flown by, with the children getting up early to check on the hens even before CBBC goes on in the morning. We are still learning about their care, but muddling through doesn't seem to have harmed them. As I write, one has just begun laying and we are now the owners of three smallish brown eggs. We think it is Betty, the Cuckoo Marans and leader of our new flock.

Photograph: Cameron Laird/Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cameron Laird/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the yacht Kaz II was found off Australia's Great Barrier Reef, drifting and no one on board, there were many theories about what could have happened to its three middle-aged crew members. </p> <p>There were suggestions the skipper, Des Batten, and brothers Peter and John Tunstead staged their own disappearance for insurance purposes or suffered at the hands of drug smugglers or pirates. </p> <p>One of the wilder theories was that some kind of paranormal event had happened aboard their catamaran and inevitably, comparisons were made to the lost crew of another \"ghost\" ship, the Mary Celeste.</p> <p>But yesterday a coroner in Townsville, Queensland, ended the speculation that has been buzzing around the bars of Australian yachting clubs for months by ruling that the three friends drowned in a freak accident during what was supposed to have been a trip of a lifetime, even though their bodies have never been found.</p> <p>The trio, described as \"typical Aussie blokes\", vanished after setting sail on April 15 last year on a planned two-month trip, bound for Western Australia where they all lived. Three days later, the white-painted vessel which Mr Batten had only recently bought for \u00a360,000 was found adrift and with a ripped sail about 100 miles north-east of Townsville, near the Whitsunday islands. </p> <p>The engine was idling, a half-empty cup of coffee and a laptop computer were sitting on a table, a newspaper was lying open with some pages strewn on the floor and clothing had been piled on a bench. </p> <p>The men went to sea with a large supply of food, three cases of beer, a .44 calibre rifle and 100 rounds of ammunition, the inquest was told. </p> <p>Coroner Michael Barnes said evidence put before him during a four day inquest led him to conclude that \"an unfortunate series of events,\" befell the trio, who were all relatively inexperienced sailors, only a few hours after they set sail. </p> <p>In the scenario he laid out, the coroner said one of the brothers attempted to free a fishing line that had become wrapped around the yacht's propeller when he fell overboard. The other brother fell in while trying to rescue him. </p> <p>Mr Batten tried to drop the sails so he could turn around and go back for his two friends but a change in the wind's direction caused the yacht's boom to swing and knock him overboard.</p> <p>\"Once the three men were in the water there was very little chance they could get back on the boat,\" he said. \"It would be beyond their reach in seconds. From that point, the end would have been swift. </p> <p>\"None of them was a good swimmer, the seas were choppy, they would have quickly become exhausted and sunk beneath the waves. Although I can't exclude the possibility of a shark attacking them, drowning is a far more likely cause of death.\"</p> <p>Rescue officer Corrie Benson told the inquest earlier this week that he found an \"eerie\" scene when he was winched down from a helicopter to search the stricken vessel. </p> <p>He saw the discarded coffee cup and newspapers and found knives strewn on the floor. \"My biggest fear was being attacked by somebody who did not want me on the boat. I was 160km out to sea with no back-up,\" he told the court earlier this week.</p> <p>\"I didn't know if someone was going to burst through a cupboard and go at me with a knife. I saw all the knives on the ground, but no blood, and thought 'what the ... ?'\"</p> <p>Graeme Douglas, the boat's previous owner, also gave evidence saying he had warned the men not to leave the Whitsunday area because they did not seem to have enough experience. The 56-year-old skipper, he said, was the only one of the trio who had sailed a large vessel before while the Tunstead brothers, aged 69 and 63, had minimal boating experience. </p> <p>Mr Douglas said the men appeared nervous about the trip but anxious to get under way, since their original start date had been postponed because of bad weather and the fact that they had trouble understanding the vessel's global positioning system. \"I said if you're not ready, don't go,\" he said.</p> <p>A video, shot the morning the men headed out to sea, was also shown to the court. Mr Batten, a semi-retired carpet layer was holding the camera and Jim Tunstead can be seen fishing while he and Mr Batten are heard mocking Peter Tunstead, a non-swimmer, who was sitting fishing at the back with the safety rail down. He was not wearing a lifejacket. In the film, the men talk about \"threatening skies\" ahead.</p> <p>The coroner said there was no evidence of any third party involvement in the disappearance of the sailors and noted that there had been no suspicious transactions in their finances.</p>",
  "<p>Estate agents have warned that the government's refusal to commit to suspension of stamp duty on house purchases is leading to a freeze in house sales as potential buyers hesitate until any tax changes are announced.</p> <p>But ministers and Whitehall officials yesterday closed ranks against calls for a stamp duty holiday and warned consumers that still-falling property prices and the mortgage famine are far more serious problems for the stalled housing market.</p> <p>After a week of renewed media speculation about a plan to ease stamp duty, the housing minister, Caroline Flint, moved to squash expectations that such action was imminent. </p> <p>Estate agents and some newspapers have been calling for it since May. But the deepening gloom which saw prices fall by 11% on an annualised basis last month - and repossessions rise to 18,900 so far this year - has led to claims that uncertainty over the duty is making buyers hold back, thus making matters worse.</p> <p>Peter Bolton King, chief executive of the National Association of Estate Agents, said: \"It's getting even worse; the estate agents are getting people, and even those who have already agreed to buy property, asking what they should do.\"</p> <p>\"It's definitely having an effect. Anything that makes people unsure about buying freezes the market,\" Keith Pattinson, an estate agent in the north-east, said.</p> <p>In a tour of radio and TV studios, Flint said a stamp duty holiday was just one of a \"range of options\". She said: \"We do have to make sure that we look at what will have the best impact on helping the housing market move again.\"</p> <p>But the minister pointed out that she had been saying during four months of speculation over stamp duty that suspension \"in itself, may not kickstart the market in the way that people think it might\". The bigger influences on the market were price uncertainty and the mortgage shortage arising from the global credit crunch, Flint told Radio 4's World at One.</p>",
  "<p>In this summer of 2008, it feels as if our future is crystallising before our eyes. Food shortages, the credit crisis, escalating oil prices, a melting Arctic ice cap and the failure of the Doha trade negotiations: one or all of these issues could be the harbingers of profound change for our global civilisation. And just 16 months from now, in December 2009 in Denmark, humanity will face what many argue is its toughest challenge ever: to agree the fundamentals of a climate treaty to succeed the Kyoto protocol.</p> <p>It all seems to have happened so quickly. Just two years ago we received warning of an imminent disaster - a climatic shift that \"could easily be described as hell: so hot, so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive\". The Cassandra was no deep green fundamentalist, but James Lovelock, the acclaimed scientist, pro-nuclear advocate and past adviser to Margaret Thatcher, who, 27 years earlier, had surprised the scientific community with his book Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth (OUP). At a time when reductionist science (which breaks down the world into small units in order to understand it) prevailed, Lovelock took the opposite approach, describing Earth as a single, self-regulating entity, whose function can be disturbed by human activities. It became one of the most influential books of the 20th century.</p> <p>In The Revenge of Gaia (Penguin), published in August 2006, the 86-year-old Lovelock concluded that \"we have unknowingly declared war on Gaia\", and that our only hope of rescue lies in a massive deployment of nuclear energy. The book found a wide readership, yet it failed to mobilise humanity to swift action. His nuclear solution instead divided environmentalists, and the bleakness of his vision was difficult to bear. And again his science went against conventional wisdom, for the most widely accepted assessment of future climate change at the time indicated that his bleak outcome was only a remote possibility.</p> <p>Other, more conventional readings of our climatic future became available in 2006, the most influential of which was Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. His computer presentation, which became both a successful movie and a bestselling book, opens with dramatic footage of collapsing ice shelves, melting glaciers and hurricane damage, then goes on to catalogue deleterious changes in ecosystems as diverse as tundra and coral reefs. If Lovelock diagnosed Gaia as having a fever, then Gore laid out the symptoms detail by detail. His examples were drawn primarily from refereed scientific publications in the world's leading journals, backed up with personal anecdotes from many of the scientists involved. My own book The Weather Makers (Penguin) draws on the same body of data, as does the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and countless other books and articles written at the time.</p> <p>An Inconvenient Truth was fundamental to the great climatic awakening that occurred late in 2006. I have no doubt that in years to come whole books will be devoted to analysing this shift in global public sentiment, which occurred between mid-August and late September. It is exceedingly rare that a film or book makes such a profound impact, yet An Inconvenient Truth marked the moment when the fossil-fuel industry and its political pawns lost their decades-long grip on public opinion, and perhaps inevitably Gore - who had been Clinton's vice-president and had won the popular vote in the most divisive election in recent US history, only to be denied the presidency by the supreme court - was excoriated in the rightwing press. It was as if the bitter race for the presidency had spilled out into climate science. I was lecturing at universities in middle America in 2007 when Gore and the IPCC were jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize. The naked anger and cynicism - at everything from Gore to peace prizes and Norwegians in general - were frightening.</p> <p>There are dangers in summarising complex science in a 90-minute presentation. Gore was excoriated for explaining that many glaciers are melting - faster indeed than any climatic model predicts - but failing to mention that a very few are growing. Furthermore, his explanation of the causes of climatic change in the geological past was of necessity simple, as was his narrative of contemporary climate change. Both result from a complex interaction of factors, as is well illustrated by the relationship between global warming and hurricane activity. After An Inconvenient Truth was published, researchers discovered that only around half of the increase in global hurricane activity could be directly attributed to an increase in Earth's average temperature. None of this, in my opinion, detracts from the veracity of Gore's exposition.</p> <p>Few books about climate change have been written by the meteorologists and atmospheric physicists that dominate the field. One charming exception is Willi Dansgaard's memoir Frozen Annals (Niels Bohr Institute, 2005). Dansgaard's involvement with climate science goes back to 1947, when he was sent to northwestern Greenland by the Danish weather service. Much of his life has been spent on the Greenland ice cap, drilling, retrieving and analysing the ice cores that provide the key to our understanding of past changes in climate. His book is surprisingly funny and tender, and makes obvious how hard-won is our basic knowledge of climate science.</p> <p>The first attempt at sampling the Greenland ice involved cutting pieces from bergs - an extremely hazardous practice that almost cost Dansgaard his life. While cutting into one, he writes, \"with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off. Fortunately, I fell on to the main part of the chunk, but now it started turning round so I ended up in the water . . . I began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice. There was none . . . I was not afraid of being so close to drowning, but of deserting Inge and our two kids, and I was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance.\" Just \"at that moment a true miracle occurred\" - the arrival of a \"rowboat sent out from Klaushavn\".</p> <p>A critical advance occurred in 1964, when an American-Danish collaboration began at Camp Century, perched high on the Greenland ice cap. The \"camp\" was a massive series of tunnels gouged in the ice, its facilities powered by a nuclear reactor. Spawned of the cold war, the facility had been envisaged as the first stage of a monstrous instrument of conflict, involving the sequestering of 600 nuclear missiles in 4,000km of tunnels. To support it, a city for 11,000 people was to be built inside the mighty ice cap - one of the most hostile and remote environments on Earth. The military planners, however, had failed to remember that ice flows, which means that tunnels and caverns drilled in it soon become hopelessly distorted.</p> <p>Camp Century was destined to play a very different role, for it was here that the first deep drilling into the Greenland ice cap occurred. Dansgaard conveys beautifully what it was like to work in such a bizarre environment, along with the wonders revealed when analysing that core - the discovery of evidence for the little ice age, the medieval warm period, and the great ice age that covered northern Europe and North America. Then, at the very bottom - 1.4km down - the researchers found evidence of a distant time when Earth was slightly warmer than it is today. They had, they realised, pierced right through the 100,000 years of a full glacial cycle - an entire ice age - and had come out the other side into a world that existed 130,000 years ago. It was a triumph they hardly dared hope for.</p> <p>Elucidating the cyclical nature of past changes in climate was the first great achievement of the ice-cap drilling project. One of the more striking cycles they discovered was a rapid warming that occurred every 1,500 years or so throughout the past 100,000 years. These oscillations between warm and cold conditions are now known as Dansgaard-Oeschger events.</p> <p>A sophisticated understanding of the great climatic cycles has permitted a new approach to the climate problem that finds its closest parallel in the \"wiggle matching\" used by stock-market analysis. William Ruddiman is a climatic historian whose book Ploughs, Plagues and Petroleum, published by Princeton in 2005, uses this approach to identify evidence of human impact on the climate system, by identifying precisely where we are in the current cycle and comparing the trend with earlier ones. We are, he explains, 12,000 years into a cooling phase which, judging from previous cycles, should continue for tens of thousands of years more. Instead the world is warming. But what is most remarkable about Ruddiman's work is the evidence it provides for an initial disruption to the climate system that occurred long before the industrial revolution - around 8,000 years ago. </p> <p>It was then, at the dawn of agriculture, that the \"wiggle\" of the current cycle first departed from earlier patterns - for instead of cooling, Earth's average temperature remained remarkably stable. Ruddiman thinks that this was caused by carbon and methane being released into the atmosphere from early agriculture and the destruction of forests. In his account, human activity and the great cycles struck a delicate balance that allowed the flowering of civilisations. He also sees evidence in the ice cores for the consequences of the Black Death (a drop of around two parts per million of CO2 as forests grew over abandoned fields, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere), as well as other historic events. Aspects of his work remain highly contentious, yet I believe that Ruddiman's realisation that the gaseous composition of Earth's atmosphere is an exquisitely sensitive barometer of changes to life itself represents a great breakthrough.</p> <p>Now that the majority of politicians, industry leaders and the public are convinced there is a climate problem, the focus is on what to do. The most influential assessments of the problem's scale are doubtless those of the IPCC, whose projections of various outcomes form the basis of global negotiations and national action plans. One of the most influential of these projections concerns the extent to which Earth's surface will warm over the next century. The lower bound is 1.4\u00b0C; the upper bound is 5.8\u00b0C. This is an extraordinary range of possible impacts - 1.4\u00b0C poses some threat, but 5.8\u00b0C is widely recognised as sufficient to induce a Lovelockian Ragnarok. The chance of either outcome, according to the IPCC, is small - less than 10%, and so political dialogue has come to concentrate on the mid-range of the projections.</p> <p>The moment of truth will arrive in December 2009, in Copenhagen, when the world's political leaders will come together to decide the basis of a new global treaty to replace the Kyoto protocol. It's no overstatement to say that the Copenhagen protocol, as it may well come to be known, will play a large role in deciding the fate of humanity. It will come into force in 2012, and if it fails to deliver we'll have to wait until 2020 for a replacement. That will be too late.</p> <p>A number of recent publications assess the costs versus the benefits of action to combat climate change. Among the most influential, and the most hotly contested, is the Stern review on the economics of climate change, a dense 692-page argument, published last year, the most famous finding of which is that \"the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting\". Nicholas Stern's argument was challenged almost immediately in Cool It by the Danish statistician Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg, author of The Skeptical Environmentalist (Cambridge University Press).</p> <p>Lomborg does not doubt that global warming is occurring, nor that it is caused by humans, but almost alone among commentators he finds reason to welcome it. In Europe, he explains, only 200,000 people die from excess heat each year, while 1.5 million die from cold. His message is simple: more warming, less death. Lomborg's style is marked by glib, misleading associations. Even if the sea rises, Lomborg says, we shouldn't worry - we'll just put up dykes. With dykes, he asserts, some nations might end up with more land than they have today. And so the arguments go on, from rising seas to extreme weather events to malaria and other tropical diseases, the collapse of the Gulf Stream, food shortages and water shortages. In one case after another, Lomborg asserts that it's cheaper and better to do nothing immediate to combat climate change, but to invest in adapting to its consequences. It is in great contrast to Stern's painstaking and detailed analysis, and it entirely fails to dent Stern's case.</p> <p>In A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies (Yale), the respected economist William Nordhaus asks how to deal most cost-effectively with the climate problem. He accepts the projections of the IPCC as a correct basis on which to undertake his analysis, and sets out to examine five policy options, ranging from \"do nothing\" through to \"ambitious\" proposals such as those advocated by Gore and Stern. He concludes that the ambitious proposals are disastrously expensive, and should be avoided. But do the IPCC projections reliably reflect future changes in climate?</p> <p>In 2007, scientists began comparing real-world trends with the panel's projections. They found that for the key performance indicators - the rate of warming, the rise in sea level and CO2 accumulation - real-world changes were at the upper bound or beyond the worst-case scenario presented by the IPCC. Further evidence that climate change is moving faster than we thought can be found at the north pole. The sea ice that covers the Arctic Ocean has glistened brightly into space for at least 3m years, and by reflecting the sun's energy it acts as a refrigerator that cools the entire planet. But where the ice melts, the dark ocean is revealed, and that captures solar energy and turns it into heat. </p> <p>In the summer of 2005, the rate of ice loss accelerated dramatically and has remained high ever since, the summer of 2007 seeing the greatest loss of Arctic ice ever. The scientific community is split on how the melting will turn out this year. A recent survey of Arctic specialists indicated that the majority consider a loss as great as that of 2007 to be unlikely, yet by June 2008 signs of a great melt were emerging and a senior adviser to the Norwegian government was warning that this may be the Arctic's first ice-free year. As I write, the rate of loss, while still well above average, has slowed somewhat. Yet even now it's impossible to predict. We can only project that if this summer's melt trajectory follows recent decades, by September this year the Arctic ice cap will have lost around half of its remaining ice, and be just 2.2m square kilometres.</p> <p>Most of those interested in climate science nowadays access information online, and one of the most significant of such contributions was recently posted by James Hansen, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute, and his colleagues, who have provided a partial explanation for these changes. They revisited a key piece of science underpinning the IPCC's work - the findings about how much warming a given amount of atmospheric CO2 pollution would produce - and discovered that, when viewed over the longer term, Earth's climate system is about twice as sensitive to CO2 pollution as is illustrated in the panel's century-long projections. One conclusion they drew is that there is already enough greenhouse gas pollution in the atmosphere to cause 2\u00b0C of warming - bringing about conditions not seen on Earth for 2m to 3m years, and constituting, according to the authors, \"a degree of warming that would surely yield 'dangerous' climate impacts\".</p> <p>Hansen and his colleagues pointed to a new understanding of how long it takes for the full warming consequences of a given amount of greenhouse gas to be felt. They concluded that we could expect to feel a third of any warming in the first few years. As Hansen and his colleagues put it: \"Sea-level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record, in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human-made forcing. This indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed, and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed.\"</p> <p>They also make a useful discrimination between climatic \"tipping points\" and \"the point of no return\". A tipping point is that at which the greenhouse gas concentration reaches a level sufficient to cause catastrophic climate change, while a point of no return is reached when that concentration of greenhouse gas has been in place sufficiently long to begin an irreversible process. Humanity is currently suspended between a tipping point and a point of no return, and the point of no return is likely to be reached within two decades.</p> <p>In summarising their findings, the researchers state that \"if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm\". This, they believe, can only be achieved by phasing out all conventional coal burning by 2030, and by aggressively reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by capturing it in growing tropical forests and in agricultural soils. That a rapid phase-out of coal is simply not enough is elegantly illustrated by the fact that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would remain above 350ppm for 200 years were a coal phase-out achieved within the next decade or two, and nothing else done.</p> <p>In his analysis, Nordhaus does identify one economically effective strategy worth pursuing. Called the \"low-cost backstop\", it revolves around identifying and developing some as yet unknown technology to combat the problem. Possible candidates include \"low-cost solar power, geothermal energy, some non-intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon-eating trees\".</p> <p>Writing in the New York Review of Books, Freeman Dyson has explored the unappealing option of such trees. The graph that first alerted humanity to the climate problem - drawn up by Charles David Keeling to show the CO2 increase from 1956 to the present - might, Dyson argues, hold the key to the solution. The graph has a generally rising line, with jags, like saw teeth, along it, which indicate a spike in CO2 each autumn in the northern hemisphere and a dip each spring. The difference between the minimum and maximum each year is around six parts per million, and it is due to the growth, then leaf fall, of the forests that grow across North America, Europe and Asia. It turns out, Dyson says, \"that about 8% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year\".</p> <p>If only a way could be found, he muses, to permanently sequester that carbon, we would go a long way towards solving the climate crisis - hence the genetically modified trees. But the truth is that all trees are carbon eaters. They grow from the air by drawing CO2 into their leaves, and there solidifying it to build their wood, bark and leaf tissues. Trees are congealed CO2. What we need is a way of transforming the carbon they capture into an inert state. It turns out that humanity has had the capacity to do this for thousands of years, and is now on the brink of doing it on a very large scale.</p> <p>The process of charcoal-making is called pyrolysis, and involves the heating of any biological matter in the absence of oxygen. The result is the generation of a synthetic gas, or a crude-oil like material, and charcoal. If the gas or oily matter is captured, it can be used to generate electricity or power transport. The charcoal is largely carbon (representing one-third to half of the carbon in the biomass) and it is inert. Indeed, the tenacity with which charcoal resists rotting, even when buried in the soil, is clear from C14-dating, which uses ancient charcoal from hearths or fires as much as 60,000 years old.</p> <p>Modern pyrolysis involves machinery that captures flue gas or oil, and needs no external inputs to run the machine (some of the gas being used to heat the biomass). It's already being used on a small scale on farms, for urban garbage disposal (where 1,000-tonne units are deployed) and in forestry. On farms it has multiple benefits, for the charcoal can be ploughed back into the soil, where it balances acid soils, aids soil moisture retention, adds nutrients and acts as a habitat for soil fungi and bacteria. A farmer pyrolysing crop waste gains four benefits: 1) as usual, he gets to sell the commercial part of his crop; 2) he gets to generate electricity or transport fuel; 3) where carbon is traded, he can potentially sell the carbon he sequesters; and 4) by adding charcoal to his soil, he will increase the chances of getting a better crop the following year.</p> <p>With so many benefits, why is pyrolysis not more widely used? Because pyrolysis machines are expensive, and farms are mostly still family businesses. If farmers are ever to be able to afford the machines, they'll need to be paid around $37 per tonne for the carbon they create. They'll also need to be living in areas with carbon trading schemes that allow charcoal as a recognised method of carbon sequestration.</p> <p>While the developed world could go it alone with pyrolysis, unless China and India can be induced to take a lower carbon path than the west, there is absolutely no hope for us. While both maintain formidably tough international negotiating positions, there are signs of change, particularly in the energy sectors of both countries. China has a target for renewable energy of 10% by 2020, and is embarking on the largest nuclear power programme currently being developed, while India is pursuing wind and hydro power.</p> <p>Were the leaders of either country seeking a guide to determining a negotiating position in Copenhagen, they could do no better than Oliver Tickell's just-published book Kyoto2 (Zed Books), which provides a big-picture approach to the prevention of climatic catastrophe. In essence, Tickell provides a blueprint for a global climate treaty. He documents the failings of the Kyoto protocol, then goes on to summarise the latest climate science, including the work of Hansen and his colleagues. The replacement to the Kyoto protocol, Tickell writes, must work effectively to achieve a level of atmospheric CO2 below 350ppm. At the heart of the proposal is a global trade in carbon with a series of reducing caps sufficiently rigorous to bring about such an outcome. </p> <p>One of Tickell's most telling criticisms of Kyoto is its neglect of tropical forests as a means of sequestering carbon. The destruction of rainforests causes around 18% of the carbon going into the atmosphere annually, yet only a single project concerning tropical forests has been approved under Kyoto's clean development mechanisms. These allow for polluters to gain credits by investing in a variety of ways that reduce greenhouse gases. Dyson's analysis of the Keeling curve demonstrates just how powerful forests can be as sequesterers of carbon. It's widely acknowledged that Kyoto's successor must develop mechanisms that encourage the protection and regrowing of tropical forests.</p> <p>Tickell's discussion of market mechanisms is densely technical, yet much of it reads as common sense. His emphasis on the urgent need for government regulation is also cogent and refreshing, for he recognises that carbon trading is necessary, but not sufficient to solve the problem. He calls clearly for governments to regulate so as to increase efficiency of energy use, to protect forests and to mandate approaches such as clean coal technologies, as well as discussing the need to limit population. Reading Kyoto2 gives one hope that there is a way forward. But will such recommendations ever be agreed to, and can they be carried out in time? </p> <h2>The books to read</h2> <p><strong>George Monbiot</strong><br>George Marshall, author of Carbon Detox (Gaia Books), understands the psychology of climate change and our inability to get to grips with it better than anyone else I have read. Mark Lynas's Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet (Fourth Estate) is a lucid and deeply researched account of the predicted impacts of climate change, one degree at a time. In Kyoto2: How to Manage the Global Greenhouse (Zed Books) Oliver Tickell presents a global programme for cutting greenhouse gas emissions that is both radical and realistic. </p> <p><strong>Caroline Lucas</strong><br>Seeing Green by Jonathon Porritt (currently out of print) changed my life. After reading it, I marched straight to the office of my local Green party to sign up. George Marshall's Carbon Detox is an upbeat and inspiring guide to lowering your carbon footprint. The Flood (Saqi Books), Maggie Gee's dystopian vision of a flooded future, with its well-drawn characters and lively prose, shows how the poor will always be the first to suffer the effects of climate change.</p> <p><strong>Mark Lynas</strong><br>In Kyoto2, Oliver Tickell makes a radical suggestion: that instead of trying to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide, we should instead go \"upstream\" and regulate the production of carbon-based fossil fuels. Think of a garden sprinkler: if you want to stop the lawn getting wet, you don't try to catch each drop as it falls - you turn off the tap.</p> <p>The World Without Us (Virgin Books) by Alan Weisman contains a disarmingly simple but wonderfully clever idea: what would the planet look like if we all disappeared overnight? The perfect springboard for a much more engaging and fascinating discussion of humanity's environmental impact.</p> <p><strong>Fred Pearce</strong><br>Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (Penguin Modern Classics), published in 1962, was environmentalism's tipping point. Before Silent Spring, we worried about saving wildlife; afterwards we feared our own species would drown in a toxic tide of chemicals. In 1979 came Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth (OUP) by James Lovelock. Not since Charles Darwin's Origin of Species has any book so shaken science's sense of how our world works. John Reader's Man on Earth (published in 1988 and currently out of print) is an overlooked masterpiece about the ecology of human cultures.</p> <p><strong>Leo Hickman</strong><br>Robert Henson's Rough Guide to Climate Change (Rough Guides) is the best pocketbook primer on the subject. On its publication in late 2006, it was sent to every MP with a short questionnaire, including the question \"How important a concern is climate change?\" Hundreds answered, the majority of whom said it was the most pressing issue of our age. Gordon Brown never responded.</p> <p>Hide Tide by Mark Lynas (Picador) is a journey through the climate change \"hot spots\" of the world. It's the testimonies of the people Lynas meets who are already suffering from the onset of climate change that produce the most persuasive argument for us to urgently face up to the challenge ahead.</p> <p><strong>Laurie David</strong><br>Earth in the Balance (Longman), written by Al Gore 15 years ago, is doubly fascinating to read now. It makes you realise how much he was right. I devoted myself to the issue of climate change after reading Ross Gelbspan's Boiling Point (Basic Books). If you look at Keith Bradsher's High &amp; Mighty (PublicAffairs US), you will never walk past an SUV again without shaking your head.</p> <p>What Al Gore is to awareness of global warming, William McDonough is to the solution. His Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things (Rodale Press) is the only book about the environment that is actually waterproof. Also read anything by Gus Speth or Bill McKibben.</p>",

We sniffed the excitement of change. We also smelt a business opportunity: to take the fascination with the biggest brand turnaround in recent history - unelectable old Labour into shiny New Labour - and to peddle it to the corporate sector, using the campaign and media management techniques pioneered by Clinton and taken up by Blair. We thought we had hit on something new.</p> <p>Of course, the Americans had beaten us to it two decades earlier. How they \"took political spin and turned it into a global business\" is the subject of one of two books looking at the rise of the public relations business.</p> <p>James Harding, now editor of the Times and formerly the FT's Washington correspondent, focuses on the Sawyer Miller Group, the pioneering US political consultancy that saw in television the foundation of the new \"electronic democracy\" and sold its campaign techniques first to politicians, and then to business leaders.</p> <p>David Sawyer and Scott Miller built a PR powerhouse that took politics out of smoke-filled rooms and into people's living rooms the world over. They helped democratic revolutions in Chile and the Philippines and brought political campaign strategies to brands such as Apple and Coca-Cola, producing many of today's most successful PR leaders in both the political and commercial sectors. </p> <p>While Harding's basic premise is that PR = spin = bad, he has produced a meticulously researched micro-history of a small US company that made a big difference in international politics in the 1980s, as well as to modern brand communications. He is happy to note how Sawyer Miller used its campaign skills to aid democratic candidates around the world, but tut-tuts at how it took these skills to corporate America. </p> <p>He tells a lot of good stories, and tells them well. The book opens with a timely one, chronicling the spectacular turnaround in the fortunes of a monumentally unpopular and out-of-touch mayor of Boston, who was re-elected against all the odds using the tactics of the Sawyer Miller guys. </p> <p>If Harding sees political spin as one foundation stone of modern PR, the leading publicist Mark Borkowski sees Hollywood as the other. Borkowski cut his teeth in theatre publicity, and was one of the first PRs in the UK to realise that businesses hankered after the pixie dust they saw in the celebrity PR industry. In The Fame Formula, he pursues his passion for the history and power of the movie publicist.</p> <p>While Harding can occasionally come across as moralising, right down to dwelling on who at Sawyer Miller was sleeping with whom and how much money they were out to make, Borkowski is unashamedly the kid at the sweet-shop window in his enthusiasm for the golden age of the Hollywood celebrity publicity business, despite the seediness of the star system.</p> <p>The Fame Formula establishes Borkowski as the unofficial curator of the House of Spin, or at least its glittering celebrity wing. Forget the silly maths equation of the title that he slips in at the end of the book. This is a behind-the-scenes look at one of the biggest forces shaping popular culture over the past century: from the Hollywood highs of silent movie vamps, through Clark Gable and Jean Harlow, to the tabloid lows of Jade Goody and Heather Mills, via Tom Cruise and a galaxy of stars and their publicists. It doesn't need a gimmick to sell it.</p> <p>In truth, the star makers and stuntsters whose exploits Borkowski lovingly details were far more cynical and manipulative than the campaign consultants James Harding frets about in Alpha Dogs, but they are also great fun. Whether it is Betty Grable insuring her legs for a million dollars, or the publicist Jim Moran sitting on an ostrich egg for 20 days and then adopting the chick to promote a new movie, Borkowski relates classic publicity stunts that would have some of today's PR gurus weeping into their Groucho Club martinis. </p> <p>He starts off looking at the careers of publicists such as Harry Reichenbach (who first realised the commercial potential of Mickey Mouse) and Maynard Nottage, men who came out of circuses and cowboy roadshows to build the early stars of the silent movies. He looks at how the press agents became \"suppress agents\", managing the squeaky-clean reputations of their stars by keeping the drugs, sex scandals and even murders out of the news. Take Harry Brand, keen to deflect attention from his client Marilyn Monroe's infamous nude photoshoot, who put out the story that she would look good in a potato sack - and created the photo opportunity to prove it. </p> <p>He shows us how stunts like Andrew Lloyd Webber's TV searches for his new Nancy or Maria can be traced back to the mega-hype for Gone with the Wind and the trawl for the actress to play Scarlett O'Hara. The Fame Formula is a terrific, witty romp through the - often dirty - undies of the Hollywood fame factory and draws some interesting conclusions about modern-day celebrity culture.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the \"electronic revolution\" noted in Harding's brief history has become the internet revolution, and once again business leaders (as well as Brown and Cameron) are looking to the web warriors of the Obama and McCain campaigns for the next generation of campaign techniques to adapt to corporate communications. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Colin Byrne is chief executive of Weber Shandwick UK and Ireland</p>",

  "<p>Holly Campbell graduated last year with a degree in English literature from the University of Warwick. She is interested in working in human resources. \"I have been working as a PA since I graduated which has given me a good grounding in business,\" she says. \"I chose my degree subject because I enjoyed the subject but I think it was good preparation for any career. I can see myself in HR on a long-term basis.\"</p> <p>Campbell is also drawn to working for a large business. \"I like the commercial and corporate environment,\" she says. \"I like seeing how business strategy and the mechanics of an operation come together and being part of that. And there are usually opportunities for good career development.\" </p> <p>She relishes the idea of working with other people. \"You meet some great people in a big organisation,\" she says, \"and I'm a people person.\"</p> <p>We asked Lawrence Carter, head of HR strategy at Reed in Partnership to mock interview Campbell for an entry-level job. </p> <p>Reed in Partnership's main role is to provide services to government - it works alongside the recruitment and training divisions of the Reed organisation. But Carter says that no matter what the company does, the basic aim of HR is always the same. \"Overall, it's about creating, implementing and managing efficient processes to ensure a happy workforce,\" he says. Beyond that, the precise functions of different HR departments can vary, but might include administrative services, overseeing changes in location, for example, learning and development, compensation, benefits and rewards and recruitment. </p> <p>\"The first thing that someone who wants to work in HR needs,\" says Carter, \"is the CIPD [Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development] qualification. It's not necessarily a requirement for entry but at some stage you've got to get it if you want to progress.\" </p> <p>While some degree programmes do offer the CIPD qualification, the majority of people get it through training while already in work, either sponsored by their employer or as part of a graduate training programme.</p> <p>\"As well at that, you've got to have an interest in the business you're working within,\" says Carter. \"You have to have the ability to communicate complex concepts in simple terms. You have to be persuasive and be able to juggle a large number of different elements to your job. You've got to be hands-on and able to spot potential HR issues going on around you and react to them. And you've got to be willing to learn, because a lot of complex employment law underpins HR.\"</p> <p>Campbell scored highly in the interview. \"She was very clear and articulate, concise, positive and enthusiastic,\" says Carter. \"We like to ask competency-based questions and her work experience meant she had relevant answers to draw on. She was very well prepared.</p> <p>\"If I was going to offer any advice it would be to develop a slightly more nuanced answer about why she wants to work in HR,\" Carter continues. \"She talked in quite general terms to begin with, though when I questioned her more closely it was clear that she does have a good idea of what HR is about. But overall she is a very strong, employable candidate and would make a great addition to a team.\"</p> <p>Campbell felt that her preparation had stood her in good stead. \"I'm quite well prepped on interview technique.\" She didn't feel unable to answer any of the questions. \"Lawrence asked me quite a lot about HR,\" she says, \"but that was good because it was challenging. It was good to be able to have a discussion about the issues involved.\"</p> <p>Overall, she felt the interview went well. \"I thought it was positive,\" she says. It has also reinforced her interest in HR as a career. \"I'm even considering applying for the Reed graduate training scheme.\" </p> <p><strong>Questions asked:</strong></p> <p>- What attracts you to HR?<br>- How can HR support a business?<br>- Is HR about process or peopple?<br>- Give an example of a time you explained a complex concept in easy-to-understand terms.<br>- Is HR a neutral arbiter or a dogged defender of a company against employment tribunals?</p> <p><strong>Scorecard:</strong><br>Presentation 8/10; Preparation 8/10; Employability 8/10</p> <p>- If you are an undergraduate or recent graduate in need of a career blind date, send your CV to<a href=\"mailto:graduate@theguardian.com\"> graduate@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>One afternoon a few weeks ago, as John Leslie was on his way to an antique watch shop in Edinburgh, his mobile phone rang. It was his ex-lawyer, calling to warn him that the police in London were looking for him in connection with an assault. Leslie thought he was joking at first. He didn't bother even telling anyone; he couldn't see the need. Whatever it is, he told himself, it's nonsense. So it's bound to blow over.</p> <p>\"Half of me was going to dig my heels in and not even come in for questioning at all. Not after the way I was treated by the police the last time, with all the leaks to the press. But then I think, OK, let's just play it straight, let the police do their job, la la la.\" </p> <p>When a detective called, he promised Leslie there would be no media circus this time. They could meet at an unmanned satellite police station, alone, in private - and so, on June 23, Leslie rang at 1pm, to say he was in London. At 6pm, when Leslie arrived at the station, the first thing he saw before he was arrested was the lens of a photographer from the Sun. </p> <p>\"At midnight I got a call from my dad. He'd fallen off his chair. My dad was literally shaking. They'd just held up the front page of the Sun on Sky News.\"</p> <p>And so, for the second time in his life, Leslie found himself reading tabloid accounts of a sex life he didn't recognise, with a woman he couldn't remember meeting. She had alleged that he'd picked her up at a party in 1995, redirected the taxi to his house, and raped her. Police showed him her photograph, but as far as Leslie could see she was a total stranger. Yet her claims were all over the front pages, calling him a rapist. \"If I sound bitter,\" he told reporters on the morning after his arrest, \"it's because I am.\" </p> <p>Five weeks later the charges were dropped, but he still hasn't worked out who the woman was. \"I don't remember even meeting her,\" he protests. \"I've no recollection of it, and she says things that are very odd and not me at all.\" There are plenty of men, I venture, who would fail to recognise women they'd slept with. He would be one of them, wouldn't he? \"Oh yes,\" he agrees, \"of course.\" Would there be a considerable number of women in that category?</p> <p>\"Well, not that many!\" he protests, in that way lads do when the last thing they want to sound is convincing. He laughs, almost blushes, gives a little shrug. \"Well - well, I know - but. Well, yes.\" </p> <p>I've never interviewed anyone about their sexual behaviour before. It feels a bit weird. We meet at the Edinburgh townhouse he is renovating - his latest project as a property developer - and as we pick our way through the mud and dust of a building site, I'm not surprised to see why so many women found Leslie attractive. Once a famous ladies' man of London's celebrity circles, at 43 his looks are now more silvery than boyish, and he's dressed in naff country-club smart casual - a rich man's Alan Partridge. Yet still, he seems to have an unmistakable sexual aura about him.</p> <p>At least, I think it's unmistakable. It's hard to tell if it's coming from him or from the cuttings file on his sex life I've got stored in my head. Leslie's private life is so widely publicised nowadays, you don't even need to read the tabloids to be acquainted with it: ex-girlfriends have been garrulously candid, videos of threesomes co-starring Abi Titmuss saturate the internet, and practically everyone I know seems to have a John Leslie bedroom tale to tell. It's hard not to think about sex when you meet him. </p> <p>And for many people, it's hard not to wonder if he's a rapist - which is why he wants to give this interview. \"I've got to walk on site, walk into bars, you know? Those headlines were just vile. Ugly and horrible.\" </p> <p>Last time Leslie's name was in the headlines, the mistake he thinks he made was to keep quiet. He was practically the only one who did - \"and this time, it's a different ball game\".</p> <p>In October 2002 Ulrika Jonsson published her autobiography, in which she alleged that an unnamed TV presenter had raped her. She has never identified her attacker, but speculation about his identity pitched the media into a frenzy, and Leslie's was one of four or five names in private circulation. When Matthew Wright blurted it out on live TV, the tabloids went wild. Photographs of him taking cocaine appeared in a Sunday paper, and more than 30 women came forward to accuse him of sexual assault. Columnists declared the former Blue Peter presenter a monster - a dangerous pervert who exploited his fame to lure women home and attack them. Following legal advice, Leslie said nothing, promptly got sacked by ITV's This Morning, and fled into hiding. </p> <p>After 10 months, of all the lurid accusations reported by a feverish press, only one - for minor sexual assault - ever came to trial. It was thrown out when the credibility of the prosecution witness collapsed. Leslie, the judge told him, could leave the court \"without a stain on your character\". </p> <p>But the judge clearly didn't know how television works, for by then Leslie was unemployable. He moved home to Edinburgh, became a property developer, made a lot of money, and was - until his arrest - leading a relatively normal life. He seldom goes to London these days, he jokes, \"because whenever I do I get arrested\".</p> <p>Traditionally, stories about socialites ruined by sexual disgrace featured women, but if Leslie's life were made into a novel it would be a peculiarly modern tale. It belongs to an age of celebrity when the law and the media have become so entwined, the story could not exist in the absence of one or the other. It can be read as a parable about the power of celebrity - or, alternatively, of its perils - for the plot hinges entirely on one question. Did fame protect Leslie from justice for years - or expose him to a terrible injustice? </p> <p>There's no debate in Leslie's mind. According to him, his recent accuser was trying to make money by selling her story. \"If I had to put money on it, judging from what I know, I think the Sun were in on it from the very start. They knew who she was, they knew her whole story, who her friend was, and nobody else had that story. I think she went to the Sun initially, and they told her to go to the police. The police asked me if anybody from a newspaper had approached me, or if anyone had tried to blackmail me. I think they knew it was wrong, they knew something was up. The whole thing just smelt, it was just not right.\"</p> <p>How the Sun knew about his meeting with the police is certainly suspicious. But as the loss of two parents struck Lady Bracknell as careless, some people will feel that two arrests for sexual assault may take some explaining. Leslie disagrees. The sheer volume of accusations, he says, only proves his innocence. </p> <p>\"If anybody can stand there and say I'm totally innocent,\" he argues, \"it's me. I've been cleared by a judge, by a high court, by the whole of Fleet Street, who'd have paid any amount of money to get me.\" But all the women's allegations, I start to say, were disturbingly similar... </p> <p>\"Yeah,\" he interrupts exasperatedly, \"because they all read each other's reports! They were all exactly the same. Come on, hello? Think about it. Not one girl said anything at the time. I was on TV, I was a public face. Yet not one girl had ever said anything bad against me. And then all of a sudden you've got a queue of 30. You're telling me not one of them would have said something at the time? Come on. </p> <p>\"Look, I was a single guy with a lot of girlfriends. I put my hands up to that. But there's a canyon of a difference between assault and seeing girls. At no point ever did I put a woman in a situation that was not comfortable. Nothing happened. It beggars belief. All those girls had the same complaint but not one of them said anything at the time? You're telling me I had 30 odd girls I did that to, and not one of them said anything. But then when there's money, and there's safety in numbers... It's pretty simple, work it out.\"</p> <p>It's interesting that Leslie's defence doesn't lead him, unlike many men acquitted of date rape, to demand the same anonymity enjoyed by victims - or for women to be stripped of that right. The accusation of rape, he says solemnly, is a courageous act which should never be deterred. If you were being cynical, you might suspect this was a piece of spin to make him look good. It certainly helps deflect any whiff of misogyny. But I'm inclined to take him at his word, because if there's one thing we know for sure about Leslie, it's how fantastically reckless he's been about protecting his image. As he puts it: \"I didn't protect the brand. Moi. I was stupid.\"</p> <p>As a child growing up in Edinburgh, Leslie was pretty square. A lanky, bullied teenager at music school, he was 16 before he ever had a girlfriend. But at college he took up DJing, became intoxicated by his sudden desirability, and dropped out to present a TV music show. When he moved to London to join Blue Peter, however, he insists he was still \"very, very straight\". What does he mean?</p> <p>\"Well, no wild parties. I had a beautiful girlfriend [Catherine Zeta-Jones, whom he dated for 18 months], went to nice parties and good restaurants, went to the right places and had a lovely time. There was no deviant - there were no crazy places to go to. I'm only comparing how it was then with how it ended up.\" </p> <p>It was two or three years later, after he'd moved on to present This Morning, that his legendary social life took off. \"You know, the bachelor parties when the doors were open, open bar, total strangers there. I was the life and soul of the party. I had a house, I had money, and I didn't view that as a crime, to have parties and be the boy off the telly and be in the bar and girls would chat to you. That's the reason I got into television, because I was open, because of the way I was as a person, I trusted people, no airs and graces. That was my strength, that was why I was there.\"</p> <p>By 2000, his brother, a radio DJ in Edinburgh, was warning him about the crowd he was attracting. \"But I was just, you know, I kept saying, I know what I'm up to.\" Leslie grins ruefully. \"Somebody once said, the wrong girls went for you - but you went for the wrong girls. Which I think is a great thing to say. That's probably what happened.\" </p> <p>The weekend after he was named as Jonsson's alleged rapist, a woman he'd invited home sold footage she'd secretly filmed of him taking cocaine in his laundry room. Just over a year later, another party guest stole the memory card from his camera, and sold the infamous photographs of Leslie, Titmuss and guests engaged in the sort of sex you would ordinarily need to purchase online to view. Leslie says the cocaine photographs were a setup - \"a pretty nasty entrapment\" - and points out that the man who sold the private pornographic pictures is now serving 18 years for serial rape. \"He's the bad guy all along,\" he says indignantly. Does Leslie think he did anything bad himself? \"Yeah, of course. I didn't protect the brand. I shouldn't have had those parties, I should have gone to better places, I should have kept my social circle down, I shouldn't have let in anybody I didn't trust. I just shouldn't have let those kind of people into my house and into my life. If I'd been a bit more savvy, and protected the brand, I'd still be on television.\"</p> <p>Surely he must have realised what a risk he was taking, though, by using cocaine. \"But I wasn't - I mean, it was only ever in the privacy of my own home.\" But someone always has to know, I reason; you can't take drugs without someone else supplying them. \"Well, I hadn't thought of the consequences, no.\" He looks uneasy and irritated. \"Anyway, we should move on.\" But why did he take such a risk? \"You may not believe it,\" he says testily, \"but I hardly did [cocaine]. It was kind of, you know - it was there; 'take it or leave it' kind of thing.\" </p> <p>I'm not sure I do believe him. In my experience, wealthy hedonists who party hard very seldom \"take it or leave it\" - and as Leslie himself likes to point out, cocaine is a basic social assumption among the circles in which he used to move. He tells me he hasn't used it in four years. But in 2003 he told another newspaper he'd stopped using it - and that was more than four years ago.</p> <p>But Leslie wasn't prosecuted for illegal drug use; his downfall came from what women claimed he did to them. Would so many really lie, just for money? There is very probably a degree of crossover between the sort of women who \"queue up\", as he says, to go home with a TV presenter, and the sort who might later be tempted to sell a pack of lies about him to the papers. But Leslie admits that how he used to treat them probably didn't help.</p> <p>\"Obviously there's a lot of women who've not been happy with the way I was with them. I've never raised my hand to a woman, or assaulted a woman. But I might have disrespected women, or not been proper with women.\" I ask him what he means. </p> <p>\"I don't know,\" he mumbles, suddenly vague. \"But I did have to change my behaviour [after the allegations]. I'm just aware of everything all the time now, always thinking, could that be misconstrued as something else? Because obviously that's what happened before. I didn't actually physically do anything wrong. I'm not an abusive or aggressive person, I don't hit people, I've never been in a fight in my life. So I was dumbstruck. But ever since, I've been walking on eggshells.\"</p> <p>It's hard to tell exactly how Leslie now feels about that chapter of his life, before it all fell apart. Sometimes he is unapologetic - \"I loved throwing parties, that's just what I liked doing, I like people having a good time, I like to share\" - but then describes it as \"out of control\" and \"carnage\". When someone wakes up with a hangover and a strange blonde woman in the bathroom, I try, that's usually quite a confronting moment. Did it always feel like a good laugh to him - or a dark morning of the soul? </p> <p>\"Well, but my alternatives were to go home and not go out and sit at home.\" That sounds like a false choice. \"No,\" he protests, \"at that point I was on television and quite well known, so I couldn't go to normal places and hang out with normal people. Wherever I went I had this kind of, you know, attention. If you stay home and go to the library, it's a long, hard, lonely road.\" But lots of celebrities manage to enjoy a social life that doesn't involve carnage.</p> <p>\"Well, yeah, but they're married. If I'd got married and had kids, I would have had that normal lifestyle. That would have been it, definitely. If I'd been married and stuff, the person I'd have been on screen would have been, my married life, whatever, would have been true to me, but I would have been - um - it's hard to describe - everything just kind of happened, there was no deliberate plan. Just getting in the wrong circles...\" He trails off. \"I didn't like being a celebrity in the first place. I liked the job, I loved the job, but I didn't really like anything that came with it, I never bought into all that.\" </p> <p>I burst out laughing.</p> <p>\"OK, I didn't hate it. But I loved the job. I could have easily done the job without all that nonsense. Oh I loved all the things that it brought, you know the money, the places, the parties, blah blah.\" So what didn't he like, then?</p> <p>\"Well,\" he stumbles, casting around for an answer and giving up. \"No. I just loved the job, the job was what I did.\" And for a moment, he looks wistful and suddenly vulnerable. \"That's what I miss,\" he says quietly.</p> <p>I'm troubled by a feeling that I ought to feel more sorry for Leslie than I do. The logic of his defence is compelling. Chequebook journalism clearly corrupts justice; the women in his world were probably susceptible to temptation; it may be unedifying for a celebrity to seduce and discard them, but not illegal. If the police, the courts and the tabloids couldn't get a single charge to stick, what should that tell us?</p> <p>Yet Leslie lost everything. The darkest time of all, he says, came after his acquittal. \"That was the worst chapter, by miles. Before, at least you have something to live for, to fight for, but then afterwards the phone goes quiet and it's a massive vacuum. You're left with this hole of nothingness. You've just been picked up, your life's been turned upside down because of this massive accusation, and then it's chucked out and you're thrown on a heap, with a massive lawyers' bill to pay, you've had these horrible headlines to deal with. And for what? It is just crazy.\" His famous friends no longer called. \"Celebrity support was nonexistent. That was one of the disappointing things. I think it was because of death by association. Everyone is so scared, and you're aware of how fragile and fickle it is.\"</p> <p>Although still single, he says he very seldom goes out these days. \"I'm scared stiff.\" He has trouble trusting women, and recognises that the feeling may be mutual. Most people, he thinks, don't believe he's a rapist. \"But you don't want to be in an environment where you might come across a drunk group of lads who might believe every word they read in the Sun. You don't want to test that water.\"</p> <p>If, after all of that, Leslie comes across as oddly unsympathetic, perhaps it's not surprising. Most people would be bitter and self-justifying, and brittle. Under the circumstances, he's remarkably unscarred - and I'm surprised by how much fun he is to be around. Nowhere near as surprised, though, that after everything, he says what he wants more than anything is to be back on TV.</p> <p>\"I believe,\" he says, \"everything happens for a reason. When I left TV, I was like - get away from it all. But now I'm thinking, why the hell not? If somebody would consider me, I wouldn't chuck it away. So maybe this thing [the recent allegation] - maybe it happened to get me back in the public eye.\"</p> <p>He talks a lot about missing the \"buzz\" of being on TV. I wonder how painful it was for him to watch Abi Titmuss's celebrity career blossom from the ashes of his own. The couple split in 2004, and if her recently published diaries are telling the truth, his jealousy of her transformation from staff nurse to paparazzi sensation was largely to blame. After Zeta-Jones, she is the second girlfriend to eclipse Leslie's limelight, but he offers only a serene, if slightly tight, smile. \"I'm very proud of what Abi's done, I think she's done fantastically. A star is born. Everyone says she wouldn't be there unless because of you, but I think Abi would have got there anyway.\"</p> <p>He would like, he says, to present a show - maybe about music, sport or property. I can't help thinking, why? One possible clue to the answer is written on his Range Rover, which bears the personalised numberplate JLS. That's nice and discreet, I joke. \"Yeah,\" he agrees. \"I think so.\" It stands for John Leslie Stott. Stott is his family name; Leslie was only ever his stage name. \"Yeah, I'm killing off John Leslie. I'm done with being him.\" </p> <p>That is the one thing Leslie told me which I would say, with confidence, was categorically untrue.</p>",
  "<p>Cricket will be the last sport on Chinese minds during the Olympics but that has not deterred Australia, who are using the Games to promote a campaign for China to become a major force in the world game.</p> <p>Cricket Australia's chief executive James Sutherland and its chairman Creagh O'Connor will be in Beijing next week, when they will try to press home their view that China can rival India as an economic powerhouse of the game.</p> <p>The Chinese Cricket Association has set goals which culminate in World Cup qualification in 2019 and Test status the following year. Ross Turner, Cricket Australia's global development manager, believes they will achieve them. \"China has such a strategic approach to everything. They will be saying, 'What is the world standard', and trying to better it, seeking prominence and world recognition.\"</p> <p>Just as the billionaire, Sir Allen Stanford, wants to promote his own Twenty20 in the US, so Australia believes the short form of the game can heighten the interest sparked by development in city schools and it is again seen as the catalyst.</p> <p>A more pressing concern for the International Cricket Council is the survival of the Champions Trophy, which is scheduled to begin in Pakistan on September 12. Haroon Lorgat, the chief executive, arrived in the country yesterday, ahead of the ICC's security task force, which is due tomorrow to make a final investigation of security arrangements .</p> <p>England, New Zealand, South Africa and Australia have all expressed concerns and have warned about refuseniks among the players, but the ICC is committed to the tournament and ready to accept some withdrawals. The ruling body has asked Geoff Lawson to lobby players on its behalf. Pakistan's Australia-born coach is convinced it can go ahead normally, despite regular terrorist incidents.</p> <p>The Pakistan Cricket Board has also asked its government to put political pressure on its British counterpart, and others, to commit to the tournament as a show of support for their alliance with the west.</p> <p>The ICC task force, which includes the head of the international players' union, Tim May, will meet Pakistani government officials and visit Lahore and Karachi to review arrangements before returning on Tuesday. A final decision is expected by the end of next week.</p> <p>The ECB has appointed Dene Hills, a former Australia A and Tasmania batsman, as its new head coach of batting. Hills, who will be based at the national centre in Loughborough, has been senior batting coach at Cricket Australia's centre of excellence and for many years was the professional at the Scottish club, Greenock. He will take up his post in October.</p> <p>Complaints about Ashley Giles's dual role as an England selector and Warwickshire's director of cricket have been dismissed by the ECB's managing director Hugh Morris. Gloucestershire's chairman, John Light, protested in writing last week after Giles's county had unsuccessfully approached two of his players, Alex Gidman and Steve Kirby. \"For us smaller clubs, retaining players can be a problem and I feel that Ashley's dual role gives him an unfair advantage,\" he wrote.</p> <p>Morris said: \"Ashley is a person of great honesty and integrity and I have no fears that he may misuse his position. There are great advantages in having a selector so actively involved in the game and Ashley understands the clear distinction between his two roles.\"</p> <p>Steve Harmison's return to the England side could be followed by up to a month at a training camp in Bangalore and Mumbai before the two-Test series in India in December. Morris conceded yesterday that Harmison's presence is \"a possibility\" but that no decision would be taken until after the tour parties had been selected.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Dear Robert</strong>,<br>New Labour has been in a mess for some time. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/election2005\">2005 election</a> was only narrowly won against very weak Tory opposition. Around 4.5 million supporters have stopped voting Labour since 1997. Party membership has more than halved and its funding is in crisis. The Tories are on course not just to win one term but possibly two.</p> <p>The cause is political. Blairism is the wrong response for these changed times. The crisis of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/northernrock\">Northern Rock</a>, the housing slump and rocketing fuel prices demand active state intervention of the kind New Labour has explicitly rejected. While David Cameron examines how to control fat cat salaries, Blairism demands silence on such issues. This is why the debate should not be about a change of leader but a change of direction towards polices that bring people security, greater equality and a sense of wellbeing.</p> <p>While the country demands action like a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/energy.taxandspending\">windfall tax</a> on the energy companies to end fuel poverty and pay for every home to be insulated all that Blairism offers is out of date policies of flexible labour markets and public services commercialisation.</p> <p>We can win again and reassemble a coalition of the middles and working classes but it demands bold new policies which address the real insecurities and genuine aspirations of the British people. New Labour can't do that.<br>Best wishes, Neal</p> <p><strong>Dear Neal</strong>,<br>I think we can agree that Labour is currently in a hole but I'm unconvinced that your rejection of the New Labour approach \u2013 the belief that we must occupy both the centre and left of British politics \u2013 offers the best way to dig ourselves out of it.</p> <p>And while we don't need to rehearse the lessons of the 2005 election, let's be careful not to repeat Labour's mistake of the 1980s: the notion that when the voters swing to the right what they're really signalling is that they want the party to move to the left.</p> <p>I've long been surprised by the generosity that you show towards the intentions of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> compared with the caricature of \"Blairism\" that you paint. Indicating as you do here (and have done elsewhere) that Cameron may be more progressive than New Labour implicitly suggests that the outcome of the next general election does not really matter and ignores the real achievements \u2013 in terms of investing in public services and tackling poverty \u2013 which have occurred over the last decade. In reality, there's little in the Conservatives' largely undefined policy agenda to suggest that any of the Tory leader's fine words and aspirations will ever come to more than that.</p> <p>By contrast, you mischaracterise New Labour's attitude towards the state. Given that a windfall tax on the privatised utilities was one of the party's pledges in 1997, I'm not sure why you feel that a windfall tax on the energy companies to end fuel poverty would necessarily be beyond the Blairite pale.<br>Where we may disagree, however, is that I believe that New Labour's emphasis on both investment and reform \u2013 not commercialisation, but giving greater control over public services to those who use them \u2013 still offers the best way to turn around our fortunes.<br>Best wishes, Robert</p> <p><strong>Dear Robert</strong>,<br>The problem is that Labour has become a party of the centre-right because of its social authoritarianism and commitment to free markets. I was struck by a comment from Lord Tebbit who said recently that \"there are some things that just shouldn't be privatised\".</p> <p>New Labour's electoral strategy was premised on the belief it could shift to the right and force the Tories to extreme and unelectable positions. It also believed that its supporters had no where else to go.</p> <p>David Cameron has called our bluff and leapfrogged into much of the centre-left terrain that should be ours. The issue is not whether the Tories will do more on social justice or not but why we don't.</p> <p>Labour voters have had enough. They are now either abstaining or voting for anyone but Labour. They aren't swinging to the right but looking for security in a hostile and anxious world. If Labour doesn't provide answers and feels like it is out of touch then it's no wonder they are giving the fresh faced David Cameron a go. It feels like time for a change because Labour is stuck in a Blairite rut.</p> <p>I agree that people want more control over public services but this should happen collectively so that they can help to improve their local school and hospital to become good enough. New Labour is too busy encouraging individuals that can to opt out.</p> <p>I look forward to your support for a windfall tax. I'm glad we agree on something. Would you also join me on action to stem inequality by increasing tax on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/executivesalaries\">super rich</a>?<br>Best wishes, Neal</p> <p><strong>Dear Neal</strong>,<br>I'm afraid that when you claim that David Cameron has \"leapfrogged into the centre-left terrain\" then the issue is very much whether the Tories will do more on social justice or not. General elections, after all, represent a choice not a referendum. The reality, as David Miliband pointed out last week, is that Cameron may claim to will the progressive ends which you and I both share, but his means \u2013 lower spending, charity and more deregulation \u2013 are very much those of a traditional Tory.</p> <p>Labour's challenge is to point to this paradox while ensuring that the debate does not become, as the right would have it, a choice between \"big government\" and the \"small state\".</p> <p>That's why it's so important that, as we shift power out of Whitehall, we place it in the hands of individual citizens not other institutions. This is not at all about encouraging people to opt out; rather, it is the best way to ensure that those who have the least power, usually the poorest, gain the most.</p> <p>But, as I think we both probably recognise, much of the public has currently tuned out from what Labour has to say. I'm not entirely convinced that the kind of gesture politics which a tax hike on the super rich would represent is necessarily the best way to regain their attention.<br>Best wishes, Robert</p> <p><strong>Dear Robert</strong>,<br>Of course we need to examine whether the Conservatives have changed. But it's Labour that needs to change.</p> <p>You dismiss increasing taxes on the rich as a gesture. But it could raise enough to meet the promise to end child poverty.</p> <p>There are other policies we could adopt: we could start building council houses, mandate a living wage, create a national well being index, provide fee school meals for all primary kids, stop taxing people earning under \u00a310,000, place a ban on advertising to children, introduce a fair voting system, drop ID cards, elect local health boards, introduce a graduate solidarity tax instead of fees and phase out our reliance on oil.</p> <p>The list goes on and on. It's not ideas we lack but the political will to make them happen because New Labour is locked into an old paradigm.</p> <p>Let's get to the heart of our differences. New Labour believes we can only adapt to globalisation and that the state should be reformed through a mixture of managerialsim, marketisation and individualisation.</p> <p>Compass believes that through democracy we can ensure that the needs of people and society come before profits and markets. It's about so much more than putting power \"in the hands of the individual citizen\"; it's about putting power into the hands of communities to achieve a transformation of lives and society. Remember, \"by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone\".<br>Best wishes, Neal</p> <p><strong>Dear Neal</strong>,<br>I think we both know full well that increasing taxes will get us nowhere near the figure needed to end child poverty once many of the super rich have taken action to avoid paying them, as inevitably they will.</p> <p>Personally, I agree with a number of the policies you suggest. But I'm not sure that they quite live up to the claims you make for them, given the yawning chasm that you appear to believe exists between New Labour and <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/\">Compass</a>.</p> <p>Actually, I don't believe that the heart of our differences is about attitudes to globalisation. New Labour believes in exploiting its opportunities and helping people adapt to its challenges \u2013 not, I would imagine, a proposition with which you'd find fault.</p> <p>However, I am concerned about your apparent hostility to putting power into the hands of individual citizens. Empowering institutions, as you appear keen to do, is a sure fire route to ensuring that the sharp-elbowed middle classes get their way at the expense of the disadvantaged.</p> <p>That's why <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/\">Progress</a> has been suggesting policies like individual budgets for job seekers so they can get the right package of support to get them back into work; a credit for parents to spend on childcare, weighted to give more to those on low incomes; a fund for pupils who are falling behind or are from disadvantaged backgrounds to spend on extra one-to-one support; and putting prisons under a new duty to reduce reoffending rates with those that fail placed under locally accountable control. All in all a progressive agenda with which I'm sure you'd agree?<br>Best wishes, Robert</p> <p><strong>Dear Robert</strong>,<br>Increasing the top rate of tax to 50% for those earning over \u00a3100,000 would bring in \u00a38bn a year, enough to end child poverty. Some would try avoidance and should be pursued with the vigour the government pursues benefits claimants. The policies Compass propose offer a glimpse of what could happen when principle and power combine. We won't transform society overnight. Social democratic Sweden took decades to build. What matters is whether we are heading in the right direction and building support for further reform.</p> <p>Instead New Labour still tacks to the right with the business minister John Hutton celebrating the super-rich. There is no vision, no groups or activists who support what you want.</p> <p>The story of the last 30 years is of socialised risk being transferred to individuals. Your policies would speed this up. Even the most empowered individuals can't withstand the forces of global capital and free markets. That's why people feel so insecure and anxious. That is why inequality is growing and social mobility drying up. And it's why people are giving up on politics \u2013 because nothing important changes in a world where markets and money rule.</p> <p>After initial public enthusiasm and ruling unchallenged for 11 years New Labour has lost its way. Some good things have been done; but it's been a major disappointment. You might want more of it but the party and the country don't. Change is coming; it will either be by us or to David Cameron.<br>Best wishes, Neal</p> <p><strong>Dear Neal</strong>,<br>Perhaps I was not clear enough: I was objecting less to the policies you were advocating and more to the fact that you claim they are so radically different \u2013 and, I detect, morally superior \u2013 to those advocated by New Labour. If you really want to launch an assault on free markets and global capital, by all means do so. But please don't suggest that free school meals for primary school children \u2013 a perfectly defensible policy \u2013 will achieve it.</p> <p>It's always dangerous to presume some superior knowledge about the intentions of the voters. Whatever the faults of the electoral system \u2013 and like you, I support making it fairer by introducing proportional representation \u2013 on three successive occasions, the country has put New Labour into government. And I think we're both fully aware that, contrary to your claims, there are plenty of party activists who want Labour to remain rooted in the centre ground of British politics. I don't quite understand, therefore, why you believe the direction you would like Labour to go in has more legitimacy than that which I am advocating.</p> <p>More importantly, I am curious about why you believe the policies I mentioned in my last email \u2013 encouraging greater rehabilitation of prisoners; focusing state funding on the most disadvantaged children; giving people on benefit greater support to find Work; and helping hard-pressed parents with higher support for childcare \u2013 is likely to speed up social inequality? I too am concerned with the social mobility plateau, a problem which Progress has repeatedly raised in our magazine and publications, but do not believe that we best tackle inequality by railing against the market or profit, which, let's face it, is responsible for our economic growth and therefore our ability to spend on public services.</p> <p>If you weren't so busy erecting a New Labour straw man to knock down, I suspect you'd find we agree on rather more than you think.<br>Best wishes Robert</p>",
  "<p>Ben Whitford's attack on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/01/immigrationpolicy.usa\">the American Immigration Control Foundation's advertising campaign</a>, dealing with population growth, is a masterpiece of illogic and error.</p> <p>We point out that population growth puts stress on the environment and that immigration now accounts for 83% of US population growth. Whitford replies, citing crackpot Julian Simon, that \"immigration-fuelled population increases will make little or no longterm difference to the US environment.\" Simon is the man who claimed that our planet could sustain slow population growth for the next seven million years. Mathematician Albert Bartlett did the math and found that slow growth (1% per year) for just 17,000 years would yield more people than atoms in the entire universe. Overcrowding anyone?</p> <p>Later, Whitford switches direction and concedes that \"environmentalists can't ignore population growth\". Then, substituting clich\u00e9-think for analysis, he claims population is \"a global problem that demands global solutions.\" Not so. The globe is too big for anyone to handle, but breaking problems down to the national level allows effective decision-making and accountability. Countries that overpopulate will keep on doing so if they think they can keep sending their excess people elsewhere. They will have no incentive to change their ways until the receiving countries close this avenue.<br> Whitford's final ploy is to suggest that immigration will reduce birth rates, ie, people will have fewer children when they move to richer countries. The facts, however, suggest otherwise. As noted by the Public Policy Institute in California, the fertility rate of Mexican immigrants in the US does not go down, and in subsequent generations it increases. Short on logic and fact, Whitford is long on ad hominem. He cites neo-Nazis who believe that immigration is a population problem and implies all who share this view are neo-Nazis. Yes, and from this insight we also may deduce that if neo-Nazis eat breakfast, then all who eat breakfast are neo-Nazis too.</p>",
  "<p>A catastrophe is unfolding in the Horn of Africa. Calls for attention by the World Food Programme (WFP) and by several leading non-governmental organisations have been relayed weakly \u2013 if at all \u2013 by the global media, despite the seriousness of the situation. Paul Bendix, the head of Oxfam Germany, <a href=\"http://www.social-times.de/nachricht.php?nachricht_id=12968&amp;newsrubrik_id=5\">believes</a> over 13 million people could die of hunger if nothing is done. </p> <p>The near-absence of rainfall during the March to May wet season and the exponential rise in wheat and rice prices over the past year are the main causes of the famine. Somalia, Ethiopia and parts of Uganda and northern Kenya are in danger. International donors are reacting too slowly to the WPF's summons, and two-thirds of the $637m <a href=\"http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L22996434.htm\">needed</a> to avert disaster are still missing. But the region's true problem lies elsewhere: according to reports, 80,000 tonnes of food aid are rotting in South Africa, for no one dares take the responsibility for sailing them along Somalia's pirate-infested coasts.</p> <p>The WPF does not own the necessary vessels to transport food itself, which is why its operations rely on privately-run ships. But with the number of piracy incidents rising (more than 30 in 2007, and nearly the same number since January 2008), private owners refuse to embark upon such missions without military protection. This is particularly problematic, as land routes are no better. According to a representative from <a href=\"http://www.fr-online.de/in_und_ausland/politik/aktuell/?sid=d52769767d1caef515cb1ad77cbcc755&amp;em_cnt=1372669\">Care</a>, an NGO with long experience in the region, it can take up to 47 days for convoys to cover 200km. The trip can also entail paying up to 400 bribes to various groups, be they tribal, religious or military. Thirteen aid workers have been killed in this way since the beginning of the year.</p> <p>Consequently, there is only one solution to solve the looming humanitarian crisis: to break Somalia's pirates by military means. This is important for Europe, too. Not only is Somalia dying, but the Gulf of Aden is one of the world's crucial commercial waterways. The consequences of even more pirate attacks could therefore be devastating for the world economy, most particularly for an oil-hungry EU.</p> <p>Under the ambit of the United States' anti-terrorist Operation Enduring Freedom, the German military has been tasked with \"securing \u2026 sea routes such as those off the Horn of Africa\". But quarrels between the country's politicians have undermined the mission. While Berlin has deployed scouting planes to the region, these aircraft have so far been helpless. Anti-piracy falls under the authority of Germany's police, not its military. And because the country's constitution prevents the military from accomplishing civilian tasks, all the Bundeswehr can do at this point is <a href=\"http://www.sueddeutsche.de/ausland/artikel/637/178095/\">watch</a> Somalia's pirates go by.</p> <p>The explanation for this peculiar situation lies in the political intricacies of Germany's ruling coalition. In other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, the German military has already undertaken civilian operations. In the case of Somalia, however, Christian Democrats (CDU) within the government are opposing this possibility in an attempt to pressure their Social Democratic counterparts into revising the country's constitution.</p> <p>According to Sylvia Griffin, a reporter who has followed this issue closely, their aim is to allow the German military to conduct civilian tasks within the country's borders, which has long been one of the CDU's political goals.</p> <p>Sometime this autumn, Germany's military mandate for participating in Operation Enduring Freedom will be renewed. At that point, it is likely Berlin's lawmakers will stop quarrelling and broaden their troops' rules of engagement. But for millions of Africans, it will already be too late.</p>",
  "<p>Will they or won't they? Will the world's trade ministers eventually sign a new <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/doha1_e.htm\">multilateral trade agreement</a> that reduces agricultural subsidies and industrial tariffs, or will they walk away empty-handed? The <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/07/business/trade.php\">saga has been ongoing</a> since November 2001, when the current round of negotiations was launched in Doha, Qatar, with numerous subsequent ups and downs, near-collapses, and extensions.</p> <p>The latest round of talks in Geneva has once again <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/business/worldbusiness/30trade.html?ref=business\">failed to produce an agreement</a>. Judging by what the financial press and some economists say, the stakes could not be higher.</p> <p>Conclude this so-called \"development round\" successfully, and you will lift hundreds of millions of farmers in poor countries out of poverty and ensure that globalization remains alive. Fail, and you will deal the world trading system a near-fatal blow, fostering disillusionment in the South and protectionism in the North. And, as the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/opinion/25fri2.html\">editorialists hasten to remind us</a>, the downside is especially large at a time when the world's financial system is reeling under the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the United States is entering a recession. </p> <p>But look at the Doha agenda with a more detached set of eyes, and you wonder what all the fuss is about. True, farm-support policies in rich countries tend to depress world prices, along with the incomes of agricultural producers in developing countries. But for most farm products, the phasing out of these subsidies is likely to have only modest effects on world prices \u2014 at most a few percentage points. This is small potatoes compared to the significant run-up in prices that world markets have been experiencing recently, and it would in any case be swamped by the high volatility to which these markets are normally subject.</p> <p>While higher world farm prices help producers, they hurt urban households in developing countries, many of which are also poor. That is why the recent spike in food prices has led many food-growing countries to impose export restrictions and has caused near panic among those concerned about global poverty.</p> <p>It is hard to square these fears with the view that the Doha trade round could lift tens, if not hundreds, of millions out of poverty. The best that can be said is that farm reform in rich countries would be a mixed blessing for the world's poor. Clear-cut gains exist only for a few commodities, such as cotton and sugar, which are not consumed in large quantities by poor households.</p> <p>The big winners from farm reform in the US, the EU and other rich countries would be their taxpayers and consumers, who have long paid for the subsidies and protections received by their farming compatriots. But make no mistake: what we are talking about here is domestic policy reform and an internal redistribution of income. This may be good on efficiency and even equity grounds. But should it have become the primary preoccupation of the World Trade Organisation?</p> <p>What about industrial tariffs? Rich countries have demanded sharp cuts in import tariffs by developing countries such as India and Brazil in return for phasing out their farm subsidies. (Why they need to be bribed by poor countries to do what is good for them is an enduring mystery.) But here, too, the potential benefits are slim. Applied tariff rates in developing countries, while higher than in advanced countries, are already at an all-time low.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/TRADE/0,,contentMDK:20732399~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:239071,00.html\">World Bank estimates</a>, complete elimination of all merchandise trade restrictions would ultimately boost developing-country incomes by no more than 1%. The impact on developed-country incomes would be even smaller. And, of course, the Doha Round would only reduce these barriers, not eliminate them altogether.</p> <p>The Doha round was constructed on a myth, namely that a negotiating agenda focused on agriculture would constitute a \"development round.\" This gave key constituencies what they wanted. It provided rich-country governments and then-WTO Director General Mike Moore with an opportunity to gain the moral high ground over anti-globalization protesters.</p> <p>It gave the US a stick with which to tear down the EU's common agricultural policy. And it was tailor-made for the few middle-income developing countries (such as Brazil, Argentina, and Thailand) that are large agricultural exporters.</p> <p>But the myth of a \"development\" round, promoted by trade officials and economists who espouse the \"bicycle theory\" of trade negotiations \u2014 the view that the trade regime can remain upright only with continuous progress in liberalisation \u2014 backfired, because the US and key developing countries found it difficult to liberalise their farm sectors. What ultimately led to the collapse of the latest round of negotiations was India's refusal to accept rigid rules that it felt would put India's agricultural smallholders in jeopardy.<br> More importantly, the fears underlying the bicycle theory are wildly inflated.</p> <p>We live under the most liberal trade regime in history not because the WTO enforces it, but because important countries \u2014 rich and poor alike \u2014 find greater openness to be in their best interest.</p> <p>The real risks lie elsewhere. On one side is the danger that today's alarmism will prove self-fulfilling \u2014 that trade officials and investors will turn the doomsday scenario into reality by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/opinion/25fri2.html\">panicking</a>. On the other side is the danger that a completed \"development round\" will fail to live up to the high expectations that it has spawned, further eroding the legitimacy of global trade rules over the longer run. In the end, it may well be the atmospherics \u2014 psychology and expectations \u2014 rather than the actual economic results on the ground that will determine the outcomes.</p> <p>So don't cry for Doha. It never was a development round, and tomorrow's world will hardly look any different from yesterday's.</p> <p><em>In cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</em></p>",
  "<p>Silvio Berlusconi has once again proven to his detractors his unrivalled media skills. He has been shoving himself in front of cameras in the streets of Naples, surrounded by sombre bodyguards, brandishing a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/2519418/Silvio-Berlusconi-sweeps-the-streets-of-Naples.html\">broom</a> to demonstrate that the rubbish emergency that has beleaguered the city and the country is a thing of the past.</p> <p>So far, nothing more than the same populist posing, which Berlusconi relishes. But there's something in this latest images that won't have escaped the historically literate: the similarity with the stocky and muscular physiognomy of Il Duce, who had himself <a href=\"http://www.valsesiascuole.it/crosior/1_vercellese/fascismo_risicoltura.htm\">photographed</a> harvesting bare-chested during the so-called battaglia del grano (battle of wheat) in the late 1920s. It was a powerful image, charged with immediacy and significance, an amalgam of the modern and the archaic that even today characterises contemporary Italian culture. </p> <p>And yesterday, more than half a century later, someone was at it again. Not that this is entirely original, or a unique quality of Italian populism. Every contemporary political leader is used to immersing himself into the adoring (sometimes less so) crowd, listening to the grievances of the people and kissing their babies. But they rarely indulge in such a no-nonsense rolling up of shirt-sleeves: there's a lot of power in the image of an immensely rich leader taking matters into his own hands. And again, one is reminded of the meaning of the battaglia del grano. It was based on the principle of \"autarchy\", the economy of self-sufficiency promoted by the regime as a reaction to the hostility of the international community. It meant \"we can do it by ourselves\". Like Berlusconi in the streets of Naples, yesterday.</p> <p>But let's make it very clear, Silvio is not Benito (and thank God for that). To begin with, Mussolini was fiercely bald and had a jaw that expressed a steely resolution. He never smiled. He did not glory in his riches, and money and the preservation of it weren't amongst his priorities in entering politics. Most of all, Mussolini started out as a socialist, something that is too often forgotten. And of course, the catastrophes he dragged his country into are too well known to list. Berlusconi is different. He might be bald, but his hair has that special quality normally associated with Phoenixes: it grows back on a regular basis. He smiles a lot, a bit too often maybe. His smile is perfect, the 32-toothed smile of a salesman, reassuring, expressing the confidence of power and wealth. </p> <p>Berlusconi, it goes without saying, didn't start out as a socialist, but as a building contractor. Socialism to him has always had the decaying smell of poverty, it is something that never crossed the threshold of his imaginative mind. To his credit, in a very un-Italian way, he has never abruptly changed alignment. He's always sided with the strong, and ever since, like a reverse Robin Hood, has stolen from the poor to give to the rich.</p> <p>But the fact that a comparison is repeatedly drawn between the two men, especially abroad, it is not merely chance. The populism, the autocracy, the cult of personality: these are common to both. And there's another factor that encourages otherwise historically reckless parallels: the use of the media.</p> <p>If Mussolini famously stated that \"Il cinematografo \u00e8 l'arma pi\u00f9 forte\" (cinema is the strongest weapon), demonstrating a perfect grasp of the zeitgeist (totalitarian regimes have got the importance of \"educational\" cinema earlier than liberal democracies), Berlusconi has really pushed the boundaries of propaganda through visual media. In this he was helped, of course, by a more than sympathetic political environment, one set up 30 years ago by his great ally, Bettino Craxi, then leader of the Socialist party, who died in self-imposed exile for corruption, and who today has been officially rehabilitated and declared a martyr.</p> <p>He might not be Mussolini, but getting rid of Berlusconi won't be easy. Actually I suspect it will be impossible. Why? He has systematically destroyed the nation's powers of discernment with a 30 year-long barrage of trashy and tendentious TV. Like a skilled jeweller, he has moulded and refined the taste and the ideology of a couple of generations.</p> <p>And there's more than a good chance that he will end his devastating tenure at Italy's helm as president of the republic. Stunts like yesterday's only confirm how far ahead of the rest of the pack he is.</p>",
  "<p>A romance novel about the child bride of the prophet Muhammad has been withdrawn because its publisher feared possible terrorist acts by Muslim extremists.</p> <p>The Jewel of the Medina was to have been released on August 12 by Ballantine Books, a division of Random House, with an eight-city tour for first-time novelist Sherry Jones, 46.</p> <p>But the publishers apparently panicked after a professor in Texas who had been approached for a pre-publication blurb, strenuously objected to the work.</p> <p>Denise Spellberg, who teaches Islamic history at the University of Texas at Austin, later described the novel as \"soft core pornography\".</p> <p>Jones rejects the charge. \"It's ridiculous,\" she told the Guardian today.</p> <p>\"I must be one heck of a writer to have produced a pornographic book without any sex scenes. My book is as realistic a portrayal as I could muster of the prophet Muhammad's harem and his domestic life. Of course it has sexuality, but there is no sex in my book.\"</p> <p>The withdrawal of the novel, first reported this week by the Wall Street Journal, set off an intense debate on the web among feminists, young Muslims, and academics.</p> <p>Many of the bloggers recalled the death threats and uproar 20 years ago following the publication of Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses.</p> <p>There were also references to the global upheavals that followed the publication of cartoons in the Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, deemed offensive to Islam. More than 100 people died in the ensuing protests.</p> <p>The saga of the Jewel of the Medina began unspoolling last April when the publishers sent out galleys to scholars and writers for recommendations. Until then, the publishers had raised no concerns about the novel, Jones said.</p> <p>She said she became interested in the topic after 9/11 and spent two years researching the novel, posting a 29-book bibliography on her blog. Jones suggested Spellberg for an endorsement because she had drawn from her work.</p> <p>\"It was my hope that my book would be a bridge builder, develop empathy for this other culture that we know so little about in this country,\" she said. \"It has always rankled me the way history focuses on men and wars and men's politics and leaves women out. I wanted to honour the women in Muhammad's life by giving them a voice.\"</p> <p>Spellberg, however, seems to have been horrified by the end product. The book's marketing blurb and the prologue, both available online, give some indication of her fears.</p> <p>The novel is an amalgam of bodice ripper and historical fiction centred around Aisha, the favourite wife of the prophet Muhammad.</p> <p>The marketing blurb compared the work to Memoirs of a Geisha. </p> <p>\"Married at nine to the much-older Muhammad, A'isha uses her wits, her courage, and her sword to defend her first-wife status even as Muhammad marries again and again, taking twelve wives and concubines in all,\" the plot summary reads.</p> <p>The book's prologue opens with an account of a story that will be familiar to Muslims of an episode when Aisha was accused of adultery after she became separated from Muhammad and his entourage in the desert.</p> <p>In Jones's account, Aisha, now aged 14, is not entirely satisfied with her marriage, and is making her scandalous return to Medina in the company of another man.</p> <p>The novel also imagines the consummation of the marriage between Muhammad and Aisha, who was nine years old at the time. \"I do have a problem with the deliberate misinterpretation of history. You can't play with a sacred history and turn it into soft core pornography,\" Spellberg told the Journal.</p> <p>She immediately called a colleague and editor of a Muslim website to share her misgivings. The guest lecturer, Shahed Amanullah, told the Wall Street Journal that Spellberg asked him to warn other Muslims about the novel. \"She was very upset.\"</p> <p>The novel became a topic of discussion on a number of Muslim websites, with one blogger putting forward an action strategy to email blast the publisher.</p> <p>Spellberg also raised her concerns with Random House. \"Denise says it is 'a declaration of war ... explosive stuff ... a national security issue',\" said an email from Jane Garrett, an editor at another Random House imprint that was quoted in the Journal. </p> <p>\"Think it will be far more controversial than the satanic verses and the Danish cartoons.\"</p> <p>The email from Garrett went on: \"thinks the book should be withdrawn ASAP\".</p> <p>Jones said today the publishers were not aware of the discussion taking place on Muslim websites when they told her agent on May 2 they were considering postponing publication. Three weeks later, Jones was told that publication was indefinitely postponed.</p> <p>Random House said today that it had been advised by security experts and Islamic scholars that the novel was offensive to Muslims and that \"it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment\".</p> <p>The statement added: \"We felt an obligation to take these concerns very seriously.\"</p> <p>Jones, who had a two-book deal with Random House, was released from her contract to try to sell the book elsewhere. She said today she was confident of finding a new publisher.</p> <p>She was also adamant that the book poses no danger. \"There have been no Muslim threats,\" she said. \"I haven't received any and Random House hasn't received any.

Thousands of Beijingers thronged the city's streets, waving flags and chanting their country's name.</p> <p>At once a glittering, showy extravaganza and a patriotic demonstration of pride in 5,000 years of recorded history, the opening ceremony was timed to start at eight minutes past 8pm on August 8, reflecting the number's status in China as a bearer of good fortune.</p> <p>It took in everything from giant written scrolls and a representation of the Great Wall formed by thousands of performers to spacemen floating from the stadium roof, symbolising one of China's most recent technological achievements.</p> <p>The event then moved on to the parading of the national teams, ordered according to the number of strokes needed to write their names in Chinese characters.</p> <p>The Chinese contingent, cheered wildly amid fervent hopes the country could top the medals table for the first time, was led out by the nation's most celebrated sports star, the 7ft 6in basketball star Yao Ming. </p> <p>The US team chose the Sudan-born 1,500-metre runner Lopez Lomong, who has voiced his opposition to China's support for the regime in Khartoum, which has been condemned internationally for its actions in Darfur.</p> <p>Once the teams had paraded, and with the ceremony running well over its scheduled three and a half hours, the Games were formally declared open by Hu and the Olympic flag hoisted on a giant pole adjoining the Chinese emblem.</p> <p>Finally, the torch was brought into the stadium at the end of an epic \u2013 and protest-hit \u2013 progress around the world. </p> <p>A final relay of former Chinese Olympic gold medallists saw the flame passed to Li, who won three gold medals, two silver and one bronze at the 1984 LA Olympics. </p> <p>But away from the stadium, protests continued. A pro-Tibet group said three US demonstrators had been detained near the site after planning to hold up Tibetan flags during the ceremony.</p> <p>Other protesters tried to storm Chinese consular offices in Nepal and India, while smaller demonstrations took part in London, Brussels and elsewhere.</p> <p>The US president, George Bush, kept the issue high on the agenda when he called for freedom of expression and religion just hours before joining Hu for the ceremony.</p> <p>The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, another guest at the event, told French TV he had raised the issue at a lunch meeting with Hu and the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao.</p> <p>Games organisers will be hoping for a change in the weather to disperse the smog that has hung over the stadium and the city in recent days, while the issue of drugs is another cloud on the horizon.</p>",
  "<p>Los Angeles have lost as many games as they've won since Manny Ramirez swapped his Red Sox for Dodger Blues last week at the trade deadline, but it's not because the 11-time all-star isn't producing. So far, Manny is completely locked in, putting up ridiculous numbers: 13 for 23, four homers and nine RBI's. </p> <p>Ramirez, who is still considering a request from manager Joe Torre to conform to a team rule and clean up his long locks, is happy enough with his new environment to announce that he believes he'll finish his career in LA. The Dodgers have the best bullpen in the National League, and a fairly decent starting rotation \u2014 their biggest problem in 2008 has been offence, as it has often been for an organisation that regularly seems to be blessed with strong arms and cursed with weak sticks. Manny is the tonic, and though it's impossible for him to keep hitting at that sort of clip, even if he slips from white hot to red hot, the wins will eventually come for Torre's Dodgers.</p> <p>Arizona, a team that that looked flawless at the start of the season, jumping out to a 20-8 record, and then sputtering ever since, will have to recapture that April magic to make it to October for the second consecutive season. </p> <p>So half of one of the best one-two hitting punches of all time has left Boston, and life goes on. Jason Bay, his replacement, is so far so good, while in Pittsburgh, the other team involved in the three-way-deal, little has changed, except that on Wednesday, pitcher Jeff Karstens came within just a few outs of throwing a perfect game. All parties, it seems, are moving on from the events surrounding the Manny deal. I, for some bizarre reason, have not, and that is because of one man \u2013 Curt Schilling. </p> <p>I shouldn't allow myself to get all riled up because of a few typically asinine statements made by Schilling as Manny was heading out the door, but the Red Sox pitcher is so irritating, so <em>infuriating</em>, that more than a week later, I feel the need to use this space to get these feelings off my chest. Baseball fans know that the currently injured Schilling, who has had an excellent big league career, punctuated by his success in the post-season, loves to talk. In fact, the self-important Schilling will offer up an opinion on almost anything at any time, and that's why I wanted to title this week's blog 'Curt Schilling should shut the fuck up'. </p> <p>This is, of course, problematic. First of all, it's not the job of the writer to come up with headlines; that's the task of the editors. Secondly, the legal team at The Guardian might be slightly concerned about the ramifications of such a headline. Finally, free speech is as important a right as any that we have, so while I would very much like for Curt to shut the fuck up, he should be able to say what ever he feels. That way, more and more baseball fans will find out what I believe is true: that Curt Schilling is a self-righteous \u2026 you fill in the blank. </p> <p>What did Schilling say that's got me so het up? I'll get to that. But first, some context. Over the years, he's been known to communicate more than your average North American athlete. He has a blog at <a href=\"http://38pitches.com/\">38pitches.com</a>, and a weekly radio gig in Boston. Schilling talks a lot, especially for someone who is not currently playing. There should be a rule that says you cannot talk as much when you're not playing. </p> <p>When he was playing last year, Curt Schilling managed to draw up sympathy for a baseball persona-non-grata such as Barry Bonds by launching an attack on the slugger that was so inappropriate that he was forced to issue a statement of apology. </p> <p>This is the same Curt Schilling who was shot over and over by television cameras covering his head with a towel, unable to watch his Phillies teammate, the erratic Mitch \"Wild Thing\" Williams, pitch in big spots during the 1993 World Series v Toronto - talk about showing up a teammate. </p> <p>Schilling also likes to talk politics, which, rightly or wrongly, I don't like to hear about from athletes. It's probably not a great idea to openly campaign for a politician when your employer, who pays you, is campaigning for the opponent, which happened in the 2004 presidential election. Maybe it's better to keep your slant to yourself in that situation. Maybe it's better to just pitch. </p> <p>Schilling is very much into the team concept, berating players such as Ramirez for not buying in to it. However, from where I'm standing, Schilling is more interested in getting his opinion out than being part of the team. On July 31, hours before the trade deadline, Schilling was on <a href=\"http://www.weei.com/\">WEEI</a> in Boston for his weekly gig, offering up his thoughts on the distractions Manny was causing, saying that the slugger should probably be traded. </p> <p>I found it outrageous, if not surprising, that Schilling, who is not a fan, and who is under contract with the Red Sox, was busy discussing internal business as Red Sox brass were busy trying to figure out how or if they were going to trade one of the best hitters in franchise history. Even if everybody in Boston felt that Manny should go, that doesn't mean that players should get on the air and shout it out. That's not how things are done, unless you are, of course, named Curt Schilling. </p> <p>Not content with battering Manny who, despite his faults (and we all have faults), was the best offensive player on the team that broke an 86-year title drought, Schilling then went after Pedro Martinez, another all-time great ex-teammate, saying: \"I enjoyed pitching with Pedro, but I watched Pedro for a year come and go as he pleased, and do whatever he pleased, from a schedule standpoint and to a point, All-Star break heading home and no one ever said a word \u2026 The things that Pedro said going out of town about Terry [Francona], that crushed me because of what I saw Tito do for him. Manny's the same way ... \" </p> <p>What's crushing <em>me</em> is that I have to hear from this guy constantly. Curt Schilling was a vital piece of two championship teams in Boston, and one in Arizona; an exceptional pitcher who's won over 200 big league games. Unfortunately, it's his mouth that I'll remember most.</p>",
  "<p>A dramatic warning that \"all is lost on global warming\" unless the world finds a new clean coal technology in the next few years has been made by the UK energy minister, Malcolm Wicks.</p> <p>He insists in a Guardian interview that \"the stakes are that high\", as he seeks to justify pressing ahead with a new generation of coal-fired power stations starting at Kingsnorth in Kent, currently the site of a major protest.</p> <p>With talk of divisions within the cabinet over the issue, the government is likely to give Kingsnorth the go-ahead, so long as it is carbon capture ready. </p> <p>The as yet unproven technology of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is thought to be capable of cutting greenhouse gas emissions from coal stations by 90%, but Wicks admitted the EU was well away from its target of building as many as 12 demonstration projects.</p> <p>Wicks justified going ahead with a new generation of coal-fired power stations on the basis that it was the only way that a demonstration project for CCS technology could be developed in the UK. </p> <p>\"If as some kind of gesture we said 'no' to new coal-fired power stations, we would be in a very difficult position of not being able to develop this technology ourselves. It requires some new coal-powered fire stations for the technology to develop.\"</p> <p>He also argued India and China were due to increase coal-fired electricity \"ginormously\" over the next 20 years, so it was vital to develop the technology that would, in the medium term, clean their electricity. </p> <p>\"World demand for coal is projected to rise by 70% by 2030, an average annual rate of 2.2%, and the bulk of the rise will come from India and China. </p> <p>\"China is a nation built on coal, so the idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in Britain say no to coal and China will say 'OK we will follow' is just daft.\"</p> <p>\"We are responsible for 2% of emissions worldwide, and we have a duty to tackle that,\" Wicks said. </p> <p>\"But the real gain here, the real challenge - and if we do not meet the challenge, all is lost on global warming, the stakes are that high - is to bring on clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage. </p> <p>\"Once we can develop those technologies, we can help the Chinese, the Indians and others to retrofit power stations and make CCS a component of new coal-fired power stations. That is the only way we are going to tackle this problem.\"</p> <p>After much delay, Britain has opened a competition to build a demonstration project, but Wicks admitted key issues about funding the projects across the EU remain unresolved: \"We are still on chapter one on this\".</p> <p>Ministers are under pressure from scientists, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and some of its own backbenchers to say it will withdraw the operating consent from Kingsnorth if by a fixed date - probably 2020 - the plant had failed to use CCS to capture 90% of its emissions. </p> <p>But Wicks said such a condition would mean the plant was not built at all.</p> <p>He said he preferred investments in CCS by the power companies to be driven by a higher carbon price emerging through the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). </p> <p>He pointed to the fall in profits for Drax power station as a sign that the ETS can push up the cost of using coal. But he conceded he did not know what level the carbon price might need to rise, adding there might need to be the backstop of a minimum floor for carbon price.</p> <p>The energy minister makes an unlikely hate figure for the climate change camp pitched in Kent and implacably opposed to coal. </p> <p>He is hardly didactic, respects the work of George Monbiot, the Guardian columnist and environmentalist, and even thought of going down to the camp to talk to some of the protesters. Even now he would still like to meet some of the leaders if it does not cause the police an extra security problem.</p> <p>He also says he recognises the superficial immediate attraction of saying no to any more coal stations. But then he points to pitfalls. </p> <p>\"If we were to have a moratorium on coal-fired stations \u2026 we would therefore most likely become more dependent on gas. </p> <p>\"I don't want to exaggerate, but gas comes from some fairly unstable parts of the world and some not readily associated with human rights and democracy.\" </p> <p>Coal is also is more reliable than nuclear and renewables, he argues.</p> <p>The government is likely to make it a condition of the licence for Kingsnorth that the plant is CCS ready, a loosely defined term upon which ministers are consulting upon until September. </p> <p>But there will be no obligation on Kingsnorth's owners to use CCS.</p> <p>But why does the government not set a cut off point, such as 2020, by which time coal stations such as Kingsnorth would be shut if the clean coal technology was not in use? </p> <p>This is the path chosen by the Republicans in California. It is supported by David Cameron, the Liberal Democrats, the Royal Society, the environmental audit select committee and reputedly some cabinet members.</p> <p>Wicks is blunt. With these kinds of strings attached, he does not think E.ON would build the coal station, or the demonstration CCS station. </p> <p>\"I think if we did that at the moment, when we do not know 100% that CCS is going to work, the engineering has not yet been tested and no one is fully aware of what the costs might be, then that would put an end to coal-fired power stations and demonstration plant and people would build gas again.\"</p>",
  "<p>The absence of the Aurora Nova programme from this year's Fringe has been a sad loss to fans of international visual and physical theatre. But into the breach step Czech company Adriatik with a heartbreaking, elemental show about polar explorers adrift in the wilderness.</p> <p>Two frostbitten, frock-coated men sit twitching with cold somewhere in the Antarctic circle. In a series of wordless tableaux, they painstakingly advance through a bewilderment of snow, metamorphosing into shuffling penguins, walruses hauling themselves across the ground and barking, bears rearing up, and birds swooping through velvety darkness. </p> <p>So careful is this production's inspection of the desolate natural environment that it is almost like a wildlife documentary. The men listen to the glaciers moan and gurgle, and their days begin to bleed into each other. Falling asleep curled up together, they start to dream of animals doing the tango. Is this a sign of incipient madness?</p> <p>Part of the play's cleverness lies in the way it takes us both outside and inside the explorers' heads: we are left with a crazed inkling of what drives them, while one stop-motion sequence gives us the men's romantic hallucinations about their return home: a smoking pipe becomes the funnel of a boat, and they strike poses for the cameras and cheering crowds.</p> <p>Dedicated to a Czech explorer with the heroic handle Captain Arctic Bismarck, Polaris respects the courage of such figures from a bygone age of pioneering expeditions, while harbouring a sneaking suspicion about the absurdity of their endeavours. The staging makes great use of simple sound effects - the wind, for instance, is evoked by a scratched record - and the performers have a stupendous, yet subtle virtuosity. </p> <p>Adriatik have fashioned a show that is both a collection of scattered miracles and a startling meditation on nature.</p>",
  "<p>Gandhi once said that the best way of losing a cause is to abuse your opponent. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/06/conservatives\">In the case of Ian Oakley</a>, abusing your opponent meant subjecting his Lib Dem rivals to a truly horrifying ordeal over two years, which included slashing their car tyres, sending them pornography, writing poison pen letters and daubing graffiti on their home. Yet, sadly, his quite astonishing campaign of intimidation, harassment and criminal damage is far from being unique.</p> <p>At the last general election, Oona King <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4535885.stm\">said of her epic battle</a> with George Galloway MP that it was one of the dirtiest campaigns in modern political history, after she was subjected to many taunts including anti-semitic abuse. Following the election, King said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The thing that I am proudest of in this country is that we have a political system where political intimidation doesn't exist. That, actually, for the first time, came to the fore in Bethnal Green and Bow, and I think people around the country should be worried about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>One of the long list of 75 offences admitted by Oakley, and, arguably, the most abhorrent, was that he sent letters to his political opponents accusing them of being child abusers. This followed the conviction last year of a Labour councillor, Miranda Girell, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/03/thecaseforafairfight\">was fined and barred</a> from office for three years for making similar accusations against her Liberal Democrat opponent. Girell was the first person to be found guilty of making false statement for political advantage under the 1983 Representation of the Peoples Act. Both the Oakley and Girell cases show that King was right to be concerned.<br> As someone who has stood in both national and local elections, I have some faint idea of what their rivals had to suffer. In the dirty world of politics, too often a candidate has to endure what Oakley described as \"robust campaigning\" and what I would describe as the politics of hate. Whenever I sent out campaign literature, a small proportion would come back covered in abusive graffiti \u2013 the perpetrator, of course, always remaining anonymous. Most of the comments were quite frankly puerile, but some were personally highly offensive and were directed not just at me, but also at my family. It never failed to amaze me that some people should stoop to such lengths, while never having the courage to say anything to my face.</p> <p>The likes of Oakley resort to these sort of tactics simply because they feel they cannot legitimately win the political debate. Targeting the local political office is one thing, but subjecting people to abuse at home must have been truly terrifying. However, in my experience, making malicious accusations anonymously is much more common in the workplace.<br> Many candidates have day jobs, which, like the rest of us, contain a fair amount of office politics. Often, employers are very uncomfortable when a candidate first comes forward and says that he or she has been selected to stand for a political party. If the person concerned is working in an environment where political neutrality is a requirement, the organisation usually has strict rules governing political activity. However, most organisations have no guidelines covering people wishing to stand for election. </p> <p>This leaves the candidate vulnerable if the employer takes an unsympathetic view of their activities and, more importantly, leaves them open to accusations from other employees or political rivals with an axe to grind. Standing for election can therefore be severely career-limiting, and this is one of the major reasons why so many candidates are reluctant to stand in the first place, particular in non-safe seats. It is also the reason why so many candidates are drawn from such a small range of professions, such as trade unions and political organizations, where political activity is allowed; or why others are in an income bracket where they can afford to forgo the day job.</p> <p>The new local government white paper \"<a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/communities/communityempowerment/communitiesincontrol/\">Communities in control: real people, real power</a>\", from the Department of Communities and Local Government does seek to address this issue, but disappointingly, it concentrates solely on encouraging more people to stand as councilors. It says: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"We want there to be better information available for employers so they know exactly what undertaking these roles entails for their staff, recognising the valuable transferable skills that an employee performing a civic role can take back into the workplace.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As a result, the DCLG is consulting with local government and employer organizations, including the Confederation of British Industry and the Trade Union Congress, over producing an information pack for employers on civic roles, outlining the commitments but also the many benefits.</p> <p>The Oakley case shows not just the need to strengthen electoral law, but the pressing case for government to draw up national guidelines governing the rights and responsibilities of all those brave \u2013 or foolhardy \u2013 enough to stand for office.</p>",
  "<p>The Italian owner of internet service provider Tiscali has reduced its sale and profit forecasts after announcing it lost British customers over the past three months.</p> <p>Tiscali's failure to attract and retain customers means Sky could overtake the company to become Britain's fourth-largest ISP this quarter.</p> <p>The move is likely to increase pressure on the management of the company to reduce their expectations of what it is worth. </p> <p>\"In view of the developments within the business environment and the strategic review process still under way, Tiscali's board of directors intends to review the business plan in the fourth quarter of this year,\" the company said.</p> <p>Based in the Sardinian capital of Cagliari, Tiscali has been up for sale for the past six months, but a succession of bidders have walked away because the price tag is too high.</p> <p>Tiscali had hoped to conclude a sale by the end of June but that ambition collapsed when Vodafone counted itself out of the bidding.

  "<p>The protest at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorthclimatecamp\">Kingsnorth</a> may appear to be a battle over a coal-fired power station in an obscure corner of Kent, but it represents part of the frontline in a global rush for coal.</p> <p>There are now over 100 similar schemes in various stages of design, planning or construction around the world and foreign governments are watching closely to see what decision is taken in the UK.</p> <p>In particular, they want to know whether a government that has talked tough at climate summit debates will allow power generator E.ON to build the Kingsnorth station with or without <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/carboncapturestorage\">carbon capture and storage (CCS)</a> technology that could hold a key to \"clean coal\" and the fight against global warming.</p> <p>Coal already makes up a quarter of total energy consumption and generates 40% of the world's electricity. The last couple of years has seen a massive swing towards king coal after decades when it looked doomed to be phased out, because of acid rain and then greenhouse gases, of which it is a huge emitter. Its use in US power stations alone is responsible for 1.5bn tonnes of CO2 emissions a year.</p> <p>Despite mounting fears about carbon pollution, coal has returned to fashion because rival energy sources such as gas are soaring in price and being depleted faster than expected. Coal reserves are also often located in politically stable countries such as the US, South Africa and Australia.<br>Coal, which has traditionally been a cheap power source, is also prized as a fuel for electricity generation because it does not have the problem of intermittency of supply associated with solar or wind, and plants do not have to be kept running all the time as they do with nuclear power.</p> <p>A major study published recently by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called The Future of Coal concluded: \"We believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant. Coal can provide usable energy at a cost of between $1 and $2 [\u00a30.52 to 1.04] per million British thermal units (MMBTU) compared to $6 to $12 per MMBTU for oil and natural gas.\"</p> <p>Coal reserves worldwide are as high as 909bn tonnes, according the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2007, which at the current rate of production of less than 6bn tonnes per year, would last for over 150 years.</p> <p>But Energy Watch Group, a German association of independent researchers has questioned the reliability of coal statistics and suggested they are often too high because they are out of date. \" Peak production could be reached as soon as 2025,\" the group argues. </p> <p>Fast-developing nations such as China have long been dependent on large domestic coal reserves, but China has increasingly looked to foreign suppliers as demand grows. China is traditionally an exporter of coal, but imported 50m tonnes in 2007, 34% up on the previous year, and is now opening the equivalent of two new coal-fired power stations every week. </p> <p>At least half of the 100 coal-fired power stations being prepared worldwide are in China with at least 10 more in Germany, another 10 in the US, and 12 in South Africa.</p> <p>In Britain, a host of other power companies have outlined plans for coal-fired stations and are waiting to see what happens to E.ON at Kingsnorth. This list includes RWE which is talking about plants at Tilbury, Essex, and Blyth, Northumberland, plus Scottish Power at Longannet, Fife, and Scottish and Southern Energy at Ferrybridge, West Yorkshire.</p> <p>The new interest in coal is also pushing up prices of a commodity that comes in a range of different qualities both in terms of its heat capacity and pollution. Lignite, \"brown coal\" is the least valuable but still an important part of production in Germany, Russia and Romania. </p> <p>The rising price of coal has seen a dramatic profits upturn at UK Coal, the country's main mining group and successor of the state-owned National Coal Board. Barely 12 months ago, UK Coal had been trying to drum up City investment by presenting itself as a property developer - keen to boast about the value of a land portfolio based around former pits. </p> <p>But now the company is focusing on coal as well as land, spending \u00a355m extending the life of the Kellingley mine at Knottingley, West Yorkshire, to 2017 plus a similar amount at Thoresby, Nottinghamshire, and even considering whether to reopen a mothballed mine in the county at Harworth.</p> <p>Despite the proposed increase in output, Britain currently imports 73% of the coal it burns, almost half of it from Russia. Associated British Ports has been spending millions of pounds developing new dockside facilities to handle new supplies at places such as Immingham, Lincolnshire, just miles from where the huge Selby coalfield in North Yorkshire - once the biggest in Europe - was closed by UK Coal.</p>",
  "<p>Police and demonstrators expect clashes tomorrow as 1,400 officers from 26 forces try to prevent up to 2,000 climate change activists from closing down the Kingsnorth coal power station, run by energy company E.ON in Kent. </p> <p>Today neither group would say how they were planning to outwit the other. A spokeswoman for Kent police said: \"We are expecting the unexpected. Our preparations are constantly changing.\" </p> <p>The campaigners have spent the last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorthclimatecamp\">encamped near the power station</a> preparing for the direct action protest against plans for a new coal power station at Kingsnorth. </p> <p>They intend to approach the power station by air, sea and land. One group intends to head up the road directly to the main gate of the power station. Another will approach through the undergrowth in small groups. A third will be making an airborne approach by means that have as yet remained secret. And people on rafts and boats will be sailing up the estuary in an armada to lay aquatic siege.</p> <p>But the authorities yesterday tightened their squeeze on the protests by formally banning the flotilla. Medway Ports Authority, using bylaws, declared the water-borne protest illegal on safety grounds.</p> <p>The campaigners argue that because coal produces significantly more carbon dioxide than other means when generating electricity, the station at Kingsnorth coal must not be given the go-ahead. It would be the first new coal station in 30 years and herald a new generation of stations. Supporters of the plans say the UK faces a huge energy gap if coal stations are not allowed and that future <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/carboncapturestorage\">carbon capture and storage</a> technology can bury up to 90% of emissions.</p> <p>Earlier today, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/08/kingsnorthclimatecamp.climatechange\">12 protesters stuck themselves with superglue</a> to the offices of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, (DBerr) the government department that has been backing coal expansion in Britain. </p> <p>Others, saying that the proposed new Kingsnorth power station will produce twice as many climate-harming emissions as the proposed third runway at Heathrow, demonstrated at the Royal Bank of Scotland.

Yesterday, MEP Caroline Lucas and MPs Norman Baker and Colin Challen wrote to the Kent police pleading with assistant chief constable Gary Beautridge, in charge of the police operation, to resolve \"an increasingly threatening confrontation\". </p> <p>\"Climate change must be a wholly legitimate subject of protest and demonstration. But if it is met by an arbitrary, destructive and aggressive police response, the consequences will undoubtedly be a continued alienation between police and many decent, law abiding people, particularly the young\", said the politicians. </p> <p>On Thursday, police had stop and search powers extended to the whole of the Hoo peninsula, where Kingsnorth is sited. Kent police said the decision had been taken because officers continued to find people carrying potential weapons, a charge that was angrily denied by the camp.</p> <p> \"What we are doing is part of a long tradition of civil disobedience\" said Maria Romero, one of the camp press team. \"We're not blas\u00e9 about breaking the law, but the threat that new coal poses to our future on this planet more than justifies the actions we are taking.\"</p> <p>Tensions between police and protesters have been growing throughout the week, with activists angry with what they said were disproportionate searches causing queues of up to two hours to get on site. With helicopters flying low overhead, Paul McLeish, 41, a lawyer and legal observer at the camp, said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/05/kingsnorthclimatecamp.activists1\">police had confiscated items</a> including kitchen equipment, children's chalk and crayons, blots for constructing toilets and piping for water on the camp. </p> <p>\"The searches have been absurdly over the top with everything from 26-foot banners to disabled access ramps taken away,\" said McLeish. \" It's a concerted attempt to demonise people and alienate members of the public so they don't think it is safe to come here. It's a depressing a chilling attack on the right to freedom of expression and assembly.\"</p> <p>Challen, Labour MP for Morley and Rothwell and chair of the cross-party climate change group, visited the site today. \"The climate change debate in the workshop was of a higher calibre than in the House of Commons\", he said. </p> <p>It also emerged that the campers intend to make Kingsnorth a permanent camp. \"From the moment the first concrete is poured [to build the proposed new power station] there will be a rolling blockade,\" said one protester following a large meeting of the camp. <br>Additional reporting by Alexandra Topping</p>",
  "<p>Global Radio has offered to sell a number of stations in the Midlands in order to avoid its acquisition of GCap Media being referred to the Competition Commission.</p> <p>The company told the Office of Fair Trading it would be prepared to \"divest a package of radio stations\" which would include it either selling its Heart 106 station in the east Midlands or continuing to operate it as a franchise. </p> <p>It said it would also dispose of GCap's BRMB, Beacon, Mercia &amp; Wyvern in the west Midlands.</p> <p>However, Global will not have to sell any of its London stations, which with the addition of GCap's assets include Heart, LBC and Capital, because the OFT concluded they all target different audiences.</p> <p>\"This group of stations [in the Midlands] represents a very valuable set of radio assets,\" Global said in a statement. </p> <p>The OFT said the divestments would \"in principle ... resolve the OFT's concerns by restoring competition to pre-merger levels in the Midlands\".</p> <p>Most of GCap's 71 local stations do not compete with Global's services, although the OFT identified the situation in the Midlands as posing a problem.</p> <p>The OFT said Global already had \"a substantial pre-merger presence\" through Heart in the east Midlands, and Heart and Galaxy in the West Midlands, which overlapped with GCap's Leicester Sound, Trent, RAM, BRMB Birmingham, Wyvern, Beacon and Mercia stations.</p> <p>But the OFT said it had cleared the aspects of the deal that referred to the London market.</p> <p>The regulator added that although both companies had a 20% to 30% share of radio advertising in the capital, it had concluded there was \"no realistic prospect of harm to London advertisers or listeners\" because neither Global's Heart or LBC stations were close competitors to GCap's Capital, Choice or Xfm, \"due substantially to differences in audience demographics\".</p> <p>\"Global will have to continue to compete hard against its closest competitor, Bauer - owner of Magic and Kiss - as well as others such as Virgin, Smooth and, for audience, the BBC,\" the OFT said.</p> <p>The regulator added that it expected the Global/GCap deal to generate \"significant efficiencies that will benefit advertisers and listeners\".</p> <p>These included \"delivering cheaper prices for multistation advertising packages and programming changes capable of attracting larger and more focused radio audiences, thereby enhancing rivalry in the London market\".</p> <p>The OFT said it was the first time that the prospect of efficiencies had \"made a material difference to the outcome in a 'horizontal' merger case between competitors\".</p> <p>Simon Pritchard, the OFT senior director of mergers, added: \"Merger efficiencies<br>benefit customers and put pressure on rivals. In this case, they tipped the<br>balance in favour of clearance in London. </p> <p>\"This shows that with the right facts, efficiencies can make a difference, even at first phase, and even in a horizontal merger with high market shares. </p> <p>\"The divestment remedies in the Midlands, where efficiencies were not sufficient, are about restoring competition to make sure customers will not be harmed.\"</p> <p>Global said it was \"confident\" that the settlement could be achieved and that there would be no referral to the Competition Commission.</p> <p>Ashley Tabor, who gave up being chief executive of Global to take the same role at GCap temporarily while the OFT considered the implications of the merger, added: \"We are pleased that the OFT has made the final decision in this case and that there will be no referral to the CC. </p> <p>\"Today is a momentous day for the UK commercial radio industry, marking the start of a new era for the sector. Global Radio will now be able to lead the industry to the consolidation it needs. </p> <p>\"We will be able to offer real value and quality to advertisers and listeners by operating the Heart and Capital brands alongside one another and today's decision represents the beginning of a very exciting radio company where we can now set about the task of integrating the two businesses, creating Global Radio in its new form.\" </p> <p>The OFT has a duty to make a reference to the Competition Commission if it believes that a merger might lead to a \"substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services\".</p> <p>Under the Enterprise Act 2002, instead of making a reference to the CC, the OFT may accept a deal that will ensure competition is undiminished.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Five million people will be on waiting lists for social housing by 2010 because of problems in the property market, council leaders warned today.</p> <p>The Local Government Association issued its prediction following the release of figures showing that there were 18,900 mortgage repossessions in the first half this year - 48% more than in the first half of 2007.</p> <p>The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats blamed the government for the rise, with Tory spokesman Philip Hammond describing the increase as \"the tragic price families are paying for Gordon Brown's economic incompetence\".</p> <p>Caroline Flint, the housing minister, said that the government was concerned by the figures and that it would do what it could to stop families losing their homes. But she stressed that the 48% increase was from a low base and that repossessions were happening at a much lower rate than they were in the early 1990s.</p> <p>The LGA, which represents councils in England, identified the increase in repossessions as one of several factors that could lead to 5 million people being on the waiting list for social housing by 2010.</p> <p>There are currently 1.6 million families, or 4 million people, waiting for social housing. Over the last few years waiting lists have been rising at the rate of 90,000 families per year, but LGA officials estimate that over the next two years the rate at which waiting lists increase will rise sharply.</p> <p>\"Even when the economic good times were rolling, councils saw ever-increased pressure on their social housing stock,\" said Paul Bettison, chairman of the LGA's environment board.</p> <p>\"Now that the credit crunch is upon the country, it appears that many thousands more people will be looking to councils to provide them with a permanent home as they find it either impossible to get on their housing ladder, or see their home repossessed.\"</p> <p>Commenting on the repossession figures, Hammond, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Faced with stagnant earnings, rocketing living costs and soaring mortgage bills, the weight of debt is taking its toll on the thousands of hard-working families who stretched themselves to the limit to get on the property ladder and are now finding they can no longer make ends meet.\"</p> <p>Vincent Cable, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, said: \"For years, house prices and personal debt were allowed to soar unchecked, and ordinary families are now feeling the effects.</p> <p>\"With rising mortgage payments and sky-high food and fuel costs, it is little wonder that more and more people's budgets have been driven to breaking point.\"</p> <p>Asking about the repossession figures on The World at One, Flint said that the government had taken steps to ensure that people threatened with repossession could get free legal advice in court.</p> <p>She also said that repossession should be always be a \"last resort\" for lenders and that the courts should make sure that lenders explored alternative options before granting repossession orders.</p> <p>On the same programme, Hammond renewed his call for the government to end the uncertainty about the future of stamp duty. Following reports this week that the Treasury might suspend stamp duty for those buying homes worth up to \u00a3250,000, estate agents and mortgage lenders are reporting that some people are delaying house purchases until the stamp duty \"holiday\" is confirmed in the autumn.</p> <p>Hammond said the chancellor, Alistair Darling, should make an announcement immediately to clear up the situation.</p> <p>But Flint said there was nothing wrong with the government saying that it was considering ideas put forward by others. She said Darling gave a \"clear and honest answer\" when he told the Today programme earlier this week that he was considering various options but that he had not reached any conclusions.</p> <p>Asked if the government was right to encourage speculation about the future of stamp duty, Flint replied: \"The only people who are continuing to talk about it are the media this week.\"</p>",
  "<p>Despite the recent prominence of Afghanistan in the presidential campaign, John McCain continues to only want to talk about Iraq. He mentions the supposed success of the troop surge seemingly at every opportunity \u2013 an attempt to exploit his early support of the surge as a perceived advantage over Obama, who opposed it. For example, when asked <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/25741286#25779945\">on the Today Show</a> last month about his absence from committee hearings on Afghanistan, McCain countered that he has visited Iraq many times, and that he was right about the surge.<br> Framing issues like Afghanistan and Pakistan in terms of Iraq has become a consistent theme for McCain. He <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/us/politics/15text-mccain.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">recently said</a>: \"It is precisely the success of the surge in Iraq that shows us the way to succeed in Afghanistan.\" To address Pakistan's troubled FATA region, he proposed strengthening local tribes, modelled on \"the strategy used successfully in Anbar and elsewhere in Iraq.\" </p> <p>The problem is that McCain's Iraq-centric rhetoric oversimplifies and misinterprets security challenges in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The notion of merely exporting the surge from Iraq to Afghanistan conflates two very different conflicts, and exaggerates the potential impact of adding troops to Afghanistan. Despite McCain's insistence, experts debate whether the surge was in fact the major contributor to a decrease in violence in Iraq. What's more, while Afghanistan is certainly under-resourced, it's not clear that the most important thing is more troops. What Afghanistan desperately needs is better coordination of all the various actors involved in the country, and a strong, accountable government that provides security, economic and educational opportunities and more. </p> <p>Similarly, while empowering tribes in FATA sounds good, FATA is <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/383wutvv.asp?pg=1\">a very different environment from Anbar</a>. Success was possible in Anbar because the US military was able to exploit tensions between foreign jihadis and local Sunni tribal figures and insurgents. These tensions do not exist to the same degree in FATA. The militant-controlled region has been outside the Pakistani government's reach for decades, and the distinctions between militants and local people are blurred, unlike in Iraq. Foreign militants have had such a consistent presence in the region, going back to the anti-Soviet jihad, that they have intermarried with the local population. It has also been a longstanding Pakistani state policy to support militant groups to fight against India and its allies. </p> <p>More fundamentally, by placing Iraq as the top priority, McCain neglects the critical threat in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and even undercuts his own proposals for the region. He recently acknowledged requests by military leaders in Afghanistan for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/us/politics/15text-mccain.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">three additional brigades</a>, saying that they \"must get them\". However, McCain refuses to support a timeline for withdrawal in Iraq, despite the fact that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Michael Mullen, has said <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/02/AR2008070202010_pf.html\">there aren't enough troops</a> \"to send into Afghanistan until I have a reduced requirement in Iraq.\"</p> <p>McCain also proposes doubling the size of the Afghan national army to 160,000 troops. However, only <a href=\"http://nationalsecurity.oversight.house.gov/documents/20080618133007.pdf\">two of 105 Afghan army units</a> (pdf) are currently judged \"fully capable\", due to a shortage of military trainers that the US department of defence attributes to \"higher priority \u2026 deployments of US military personnel elsewhere, particularly Iraq.\" Nonetheless, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/04/10/mccan-the-view-diversion/\">McCain ignores the Iraq war's detrimental effects on Afghanistan</a>, saying in April: \"Afghanistan is not in trouble because of our diversion to Iraq.\" His own Iraq policies would make his Afghanistan policies infeasible, demonstrating the same lack of strategic coherence that has plagued the Bush administration's foreign policy decisions. </p> <p>Leaders from General David Petraeus to the Iraqi ambassador recognise the <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jE3rQFkgTaEtt2THc5bORgo0ubogD924227G6\">increasing prominence of Afghanistan and Pakistan</a> as the central front in the struggle against global terrorism, a front which as been cited as <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/world/articles/2008/06/11/pakistan_tribal_area_called_likely_source_of_next_attack_on_us/\">the most likely source of the next terrorist attack on the US</a>. Lest our memories be so short, the consequences of a resurgent Taliban and al-Qaida safe havens are no mystery. These are the very conditions that enabled the 9/11 attacks. America may love its war heroes, but in trying to prove that he \"know[s] how to win wars\", John McCain is putting the world's primary extremist threat on the backburner \u2013 a threat which we cannot afford to neglect any longer.</p>",
  "<p>Two environmental activists who glued themselves to the front doors of a bank in London today have been arrested for a breach of the peace, police said. </p> <p>A group of four protesters calling themselves Rising Tide held a banner outside the Royal Bank of Scotland reading: \"RBS - cashing in on coal\" and handed out leaflets. </p> <p>The protest was part of the week-long camp for climate action, taking place outside Kingsnorth power station in Kent.</p> <p>Protesters are campaigning against a new generation of coal-fired electricity plants. </p> <p>The activists staged the demonstration at the entrance to the RBS oil and gas division to highlight the relationship between the financial sector, the fossil fuel industry and climate change. </p> <p>In another protest, the Eon-sponsored Lego model of Kingsnorth power station at the Legoland Park in Windsor was \"occupied\" by tiny Lego eco-activists with a banner reading: \"Stop climate change.\"</p> <p>The actions followed a series of protests yesterday when green campaigners blockaded a biofuel depot in Essex, unfurled banners at Gatwick airport and staged a \"die-in\" at the RBS headquarters by lying in a pool of oil outside the building. </p> <p>Around 1,500 people have now converged on the climate camp site amid a heavy police presence to prepare for tomorrow's day of mass action. </p> <p>Protesters have planned an assault by land, water and air to \"shut down\" Kingsnorth. </p> <p>One group of campaigners will lead a procession to the power station's main gates, while another will reach it through undergrowth. </p> <p>A third aims to make a secret air approach, while a fourth plans to stage a \"great rebel raft regatta\" despite moves by police to ban the flotilla on health and safety grounds. </p> <p>Some politicians have expressed concerns over policing at the climate camp, which has been described as \"heavyhanded\" by protesters. </p> <p>The Green party MEP for the south-east, Dr Caroline Lucas, the Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes, Norman Baker, and the Morley and Rothwell Labour MP, Colin Challen, have written to Kent police calling for action to resolve the \"increasingly threatening confrontation\". </p> <p>They said the escalating situation had been caused, in part, by \"a disproportionate police response\".</p> <p>The comments came as Kent police extended stop and search powers for officers policing the protests yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/7705884\">resignation of the Muslim-outreach coordinator</a> for the presidential campaign of senator Barack Obama, Chicago attorney <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/1096027,CST-NWS-obmuslim07.article\">Mazen Asbahi</a>, powerfully reflects two of the biggest obstacles hindering the political integration and empowerment of Arab and Muslim Americans.</p> <p>This affair demonstrates the external pressures of unfair guilt by association, while at the same time suggesting the internal need for better judgment regarding political and religious actors within the community.</p> <p>Asbahi resigned on Monday, after just 10 days on the job, because in 2000 he served for a few weeks on the board of an Islamic investment fund <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/08/07/obama-advisor-schiff-hardin-associate-resigns-over-ties-to-imam/\">with Jamal Said</a>. Said has been allegedly linked to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/22/AR2007102200731_pf.html\">accused fundraisers for Hamas</a> whose recent trial did not result in any convictions, but who remain under a cloud of suspicion.</p> <p>This reflects an unreasonable and unfair climate of guilt by association. It is part of a familiar pattern that is one of the main forces hindering the political integration of these communities into American civic life.</p> <p>Asbahi himself is not accused of any misconduct. Rather the issue is his fairly distant association with Said, who himself is disparaged because of the alleged activities of his own associates.</p> <p>The problem is that almost anyone who has been engaged in Arab or Muslim political affairs can probably be somehow connected in some manner to someone else somewhere whose views, activities or associations can be called into question in the post-9/11 environment.</p> <p>Call it two or three degrees of separation.</p> <p>These distant, usually third-party connections are then magnified out of all proportion and used to unfairly impugn or misrepresent the views and character of the person under attack.</p> <p>Arab and Muslim Americans naturally come into contact with numerous Arabs and Muslims both here at home and overseas. They cannot be reasonably held responsible for views and actions of others of which they were not aware.</p> <p>Some hostile commentators have perfected the art of seeking out the most distant of such ties to unfairly tarnish the reputations of almost everyone from these communities who has found a political role or voice in our society, including numerous Bush administration officials.</p> <p>If these are the standards by which Arab and Muslim Americans are to be judged, then only individuals who have been resolutely distant from Middle East and even community-related political activity can survive such judgments. A valuable and significant group of Americans would thereby be frozen out of public life to the grave detriment of our country.</p> <p>The internal challenge suggested in this affair is that Arab and Muslim Americans have not been vigilant enough about holding political, religious and community figures to reasonable standards of responsible speech and conduct.</p> <p>Even raising this issue is often seen as too divisive, thereby stifling the conversation and impeding improvement. But solidarity can no longer trump responsibility.</p> <p>Well-known individuals have been revealed to have deceived the community about their political views and activities, and are nonetheless now being championed as \"political prisoners\". Some student groups, especially on the west coast, persist in hosting political and religious extremists as campus speakers. Expressions of religious intolerance too often pass without repudiation. Self-criticism and introspection are distinctly unwelcome in many quarters.</p> <p>While it is a commonplace of political life that solidarity generally flows from the centre to the extremes, and not the other way around, Arab and Muslim Americans are uniquely unable to afford this under current circumstances.</p> <p>It is true and irrelevant that toleration of in-group or foreign extremists can be readily identified among many other American ethnic groups, and, indeed, among many of the most virulent individual critics of the Arab and Muslim American communities.</p> <p>However, the more important reality is that anything that suggests, however inadvertently, sympathy for radicalism in the Islamic world is a uniquely fatal political poison in our country.</p> <p>While considerable progress has been made, more work is required in developing a consistent and clear consensus among Arab and Muslim Americans setting a reasonable standard of what they, as a community, will regard as responsible and constructive speech and activities.</p> <p>These need, of course, to be independent, principled judgments, and not simply bowing to external pressures or reproducing bigoted constructs.</p> <p>But the impulse to reflexively defend marginal figures, actual extremists or religious zealots must be resisted, even when spurred by an understandable sense of loyalty within a community that feels besieged. Raising this issue will itself be seen by some as a breech of solidarity, but recognising and correcting past mistakes is essential.</p> <p>At the same time, it is unreasonable and unfair to hold respectable Arab and Muslim Americans accountable for the alleged activities of people to whom they are remotely connected by two or three degrees of separation, thereby effectively closing the door to civic engagement on an entire and very significant group of American citizens.</p>",
  "<p>It's great that L'Oreal has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/08/advertising.usa?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media\">publicly denied</a> that it had deliberately tried to make Beyonc\u00e9 appear whiter in its latest campaign: however, \"bleaching\" is still a huge issue for young women around the world.</p> <p>The 27-year-old singer, who has an African American father and Creole mother, is naturally light-skinned, with dark brown hair, but appears with very pale skin and strawberry blonde hair as the face of L'Oreal. She appears, if not exactly \"white\" then definitely racially ambiguous. It is a tactic <a href=\"http://www.beyonceonline.com/\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> appears to have used herself previously \u2013 perhaps to make her image more commercial. Her trademark has been very long blonde hair extensions and yes, looking as light as possible. Whether or not this was her actual intention, her commercial success is undeniable. Beyond her endorsements, as a solo artist she has sold many millions of albums and singles worldwide, dwarfing the solo earnings of other members of the Grammy-winning girl group Destiny's Child, who incidentally are much darker.</p> <p>This is not the first time advertisers have been accused of white-washing. There was uproar when the black \"Halifax man\", appeared to have become progressively lighter and his voice was dubbed. Halifax denied the accusation. Then there was the infamous Ford company photo where black faces were simply changed to white. Ford apologised.</p> <p>But the problem goes beyond the airbrushing and whitewashing of global corporations. \"Bleaching\" is a huge industry in developing countries. This legacy of slavery or colonization, where lighter-skinned or white people were given visible privileges over hundreds of years has resulted in societies where the lighter you are, the higher your status socially and economically. In <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/skinwhitening-adverts-ignite-race-row-in-india-863936.html\">India</a>, women strive to achieve the \"wheat\" colour much-requested on Asian dating websites. In the Caribbean, light skin is also highly desired while in African countries even seemingly minor variations in skin tone can contribute to ethnic conflict.</p> <p>Containing the active ingredients hydroquinone and/or mercury, bleaching creams have been linked with the disfiguring condition ochronosis, marked by the darkening and thickening of the skin, as well as the appearance of tiny dome-shaped bumps and greyish-brown spots, according to the US FDA which <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/E6-14263.htm\">proposed a ban</a> on skin-lightening creams without a prescription back in 2006. In the UK, the amount of hydroquinone allowed in retail skin-lightening creams has been limited to just 2% but demand means there is a ready unofficial market for stronger potions. Ironically, skin-lightening creams are often a misnomer, since after discontinuing use, normal sun exposure can make you darker than before. Women can then become psychologically addicted to creams and over years destroy not just their complexions, but also their health and self-esteem.</p> <p>Marketers are well aware of how a \"white\" or \"black\" face on packaging can affect sales. The purpose of the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jun/20/fashion.usa\">Italian Vogue issue</a> featuring completely black models was mainly to combat the widely held perception that black faces \"don't sell\". However, advertisers may not be aware of how younger girls are influenced by images of women being airbrushed ever lighter, skinnier, blonder. L'Oreal have denied that their actions were deliberate, but nevertheless yet another message, that the whiter you are the more successful you will be, has been sent.</p>",

It has a lot of significance and it was important that we handled it carefully,\" added Bryant. </p> <p>\"We have established ourselves quickly and gathered a considerable amount of expertise and a thorough grounding in the complexities of working in China.\"</p> <p>Red Bee has also created a package of about 300 information graphics for use in and around CCTV's Olympic programming.</p> <p>The more traditional look of Red Bee's work for CCTV contrasts with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jul/24/bbc.television\">BBC's Beijing Olympics title sequence</a>, based on the Monkey character from classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. The BBC Olympics titles have been animated by Jamie Hewlett, with music by his Gorillaz colleague Damon Albarn.</p> <p>Red Bee has also created on-air idents for UKTV's Dave, ITV and broadcasters in Greece and Finland.</p> <p>Media agency MindShare estimates that the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics will be the single most viewed live television event in history, attracting 2.3 billion global viewers and up to 1.2 billion of China's estimated 1.5 billion population.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediaguardian.co.uk\">editor@mediaguardian.co.uk</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Hundreds of thousands of Britons living abroad would return to the UK if there were a worldwide flu pandemic, the government suggests today.</p> <p>A Cabinet Office report, which identifies a global flu pandemic as the most serious threat facing Britain, says that officials are drawing up plans that would help them cope if some of the 12 million Britons living abroad were to return home to increase their chances of surviving in the event of a worldwide emergency.</p> <p>The report, the \"<a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/reports/national_risk_register.aspx\">national risk register</a>\", lists all the most significant risks facing Britain over the next five years. The government has published the information in this form for the first time to help organisations and individuals take appropriate precautions.</p> <p>Gordon Brown promised that the register would be published when he unveiled his national security strategy earlier this year.</p> <p>The register does not rank the risks it mentions in order of seriousness. But a chart showing risks according to the relative likelihood of them happening and the relative impact they would have suggests that a flu pandemic scores highest when impact and likelihood are both taken into account.</p> <p>However, the chart does not include the threat posed by terrorists using a nuclear device because there is no historical precedent for this kind of attack.</p> <p>The report says that flu pandemics occurred three times in the 20th century and that experts agree that there is a \"high probability\" of another occurring.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation estimates that between 2 million and 7.4 million people would die globally.</p> <p>Within the UK, up to half of the population could become infected and between 50,000 and 750,000 people could die as a result, the report said.</p> <p>\"Normal life is likely to face wider social and economic disruption, significant threats to the continuity of essential services, lower production levels, shortages and distribution difficulties,\" it says.</p> <p>\"The emergence overseas of an influenza pandemic or other widespread infectious disease may result in a proportion of the British nationals who are not normally resident in the UK (approximately 12 million) choosing to return to the UK. Some returning British nationals would not have the means to support themselves and their return would have a short-term but significant impact upon areas in which they settle.\"</p> <p>On terrorism, the report confirms that the national threat assessment currently stands at \"severe\", meaning that some form of attack is highly likely.</p> <p>\"Many of those networks and individuals who are judged to pose a terrorist threat share an ambition to cause large numbers of casualties without warning,\" the report says.</p> <p>It says that the transport system seems to be the most likely target for a terrorist attack, with rail and underground stations \"popular targets\". But, for any individual, the likelihood of being attacked is \"still very low\".</p>",
  "<p>Tonight, at the <a href=\"http://www.thecitycircle.com/more.php?ann_id=143\">City Circle</a>, the Muslim Institute will launch a radical <a href=\"http://www.muslimparliament.org.uk/Documentation/Muslim%20Marriage%20Contract.pdf\">marriage contract (pdf)</a> it hopes will change the face of British Muslim family life.</p> <p>Currently, the Islamic marriage ceremony (nikkah), performed by an imam in the presence of two witnesses, is not recognised by British law and often involves little or no paperwork.</p> <p>If things go awry and the couple divorce, the woman \u2013 and it is almost always the woman \u2013 experiences great difficulty securing the financial rights guaranteed to her under sharia law. The terms and conditions of this new contract, signed at the nikkah, clarify both husband and wife's rights and obligations in all eventualities. For example, it ensures that the right to divorce (talaq-i-tafweed), is automatically delegated to the wife, something that is practised in most Muslim countries.</p> <p>The contract is not just about divorce, though. It seeks to establish healthy relationships by highlighting difficult scenarios the couple may encounter in the future. Dr Ghayasuddin Siddiqui of the Muslim Institute explains: \"By laying out the terms and conditions of the marriage it encourages both parties to establish consensus on issues such as where they will live.\"</p> <p>Many couples bring to a marriage a certain amount of cultural baggage. They can find they have vastly differing approaches to lifestyle, such as the division of housework and personal finances. The architect of the contract, Mufti Barkatulla, has spent the past 25 years presiding over thousands of divorce cases at the <a href=\"http://www.islamic-sharia.org/about-us/about-us.html\">Islamic Sharia Council</a>. \"Problems arise when couples don't know what to expect. The lack of respect for each other's personality and choices is shocking,\" he says. </p> <p>The contract is the culmination of a four-year consultation process to address the pervasive gender inequality in Muslim marriages across the UK \u2013 inequalities based not in theology, but in culture. </p> <p>A major fault line is the role of in-laws. Sharia law explicitly states that a wife has the right to a separate living space, yet some Muslim communities in the UK, such as those from the subcontinent, cherish a rigid cultural attitude that living with in-laws is an Islamic convention. Polygamy is another contentious issue the new contract clarifies, illegal under British law and subject to strict conditions set down in the Qur'an.</p> <p>The Qur'an has always been translated from Arabic, a language in which words can take on multiple meanings, in a process historically undertaken by male scholars. Islamic law declares a witness to a nikkah must be a sane, responsible adult. This has been culturally interpreted to mean men only. In the new contract women and non-Muslims may be witnesses. In addition, the consent of a wali or guardian of a female adult who wants to marry, becomes optional. Parents attempting to prevent their daughter marrying against their wishes can no longer use this rule.</p> <p>That the rights accorded by the contract are rooted in sharia law ignites the debate over whether aspects of sharia may be incorporated into UK law. However, if more mosques apply to become sites registered for the solemnisation of marriage, Muslim couples will be able to make their civil ceremony coincide with the nikkah, rendering part of that controversy redundant.<br> What better way to encourage social cohesion and tackle radicalisation than building families in a context of harmony and cooperation, where the rights of women are not only respected, but valued? Bringing up children in a positive, nurturing environment will do much to combat disaffection and alienation in future generations, and could help cut off the oxygen that fuels extremism. </p> <p>These are ambitious aims. However, the fact that the contract is endorsed by an unprecedented number of Muslim organisations and the launch hosted by a progressive group of second-generation Muslims, the City Circle, bodes well.</p> <p>Yet, it remains to be seen whether the Muslim marriage contract will make an impact on more traditional Muslim communities such as those in Bradford and Oldham, and whether it can challenge the widespread misunderstanding of gender roles in Islam.</p>",

  "<p>In the dog days of summer during a miserable spell for Wall Street, along comes a live and kicking sex scandal. A senior executive at Credit Suisse in New York has quit over an affair with a married woman in London.</p> <p>Steven Rattner, head of Credit Suisse's private equity arm DLJ Merchant Banking (and not to be confused with the Steven Rattner who founded Quadrangle Group and manages Michael Bloomberg's blind trust), last week \"decided to retire after more than 20 years at the bank\", according to a press release.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/business/05sorkin.html?ref=business\">The New York Times</a> has the real reason - Rattner has been the subject of a whispering campaign following an affair.</p> <p>Although the relationship ended some years ago, the woman's husband at the time, an Australian called Tommii Cosgrove, has taken a dim view of the dalliance and has bombarded cyberspace with messages obliterating Rattner's reputation.</p> <p>Some of the allegations are jaw-dropping in nature. Rattner has owned up to the affair and apologised - but he told the New York Times that some of the allegations about him were a little over the top: \"I feel like the star of a bad made-for-TV movie.\"</p> <p>Credit Suisse's DLJ division is launching a new fund and the allegations, which are all round Wall Street, haven't been helping. So in the brutal lore of high finance, Rattner had to go.</p> <p>Rattner complained that there's no way to stop innuendo spread online. His love rival, Cosgrove, hit back: \"He should have thought about that before he did what he did to me.\"</p> <p>To rub salt in wounds, the Australian has updated his MySpace page to describe his mood as \"triumphant\", alongside a slightly sinister grinning green face.</p> <p>The New York Times published the story thinly disguised as an important high-brow fable about the power of gossip on blogs. I am bringing it to you because I am interested in rich peoples' sex lives.</p> <p><strong>Fraudster faking it again?</strong></p> <p>Remember Samuel Israel, the hedge fund manager who faked his own suicide to avoid a prison sentence for fraud? He's been in court to face charges of bail jumping \u2013 and, in characteristic fashion, the hearing didn't go smoothly.</p> <p>Israel was convicted earlier this year of fiddling investors out of $450m (\u00a3225m) at his corrupt Bayou hedge fund. But instead of starting a 20-year prison stretch, he left his car on a bridge over the Hudson River back in June with \"suicide is painless\" etched onto the windscreen. He lasted 23 days at a $40-a-night campground before his mother persuaded him to give himself up.</p> <p>At this week's hearing in New York state, Israel said he wanted to plead guilty to jumping bail. But when the judge asked a routine question about his state of mind, Israel declared that he only understood \"60 to 70%\" of the proceedings because he was taking methadone to wean himself off an addiction to prescription drugs.</p> <p>\"70% is not a number that makes me feel comfortable,\" said the judge, abruptly adjourning proceedings.</p> <p>The judiciary's patience is running thin with Israel. At an earlier hearing last month, the balding 48-year-old claimed he was too ill to stand up.</p> <p>The judge on that occasion, Colleen McMahon, pointed out that a few days earlier, he had driven up to a police station on a moped to surrender: \"If you can ride a motorcycle, Mr Israel, you can stand up in my courtroom.\"</p> <p><strong>Sub-prime shenanigans</strong></p> <p>The US Mortgage Bankers Association is the voice of the beleaguered homeloans industry which, through various sub-prime shenanigans, can claim a major role in triggering a global economic crisis.</p> <p>Somehow, therefore, it seems appropriate that the association's new president, John Courson, is the boss of a bust business himself. Courson owned a Californian firm, Central Pacific Mortgage, which bit the dust in February last year when it ran out of money to pay its staff.</p> <p>\"John did close his company,\" a spokeswoman for the association <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/04/AR2008080401834.html\">told the Washington Post's business columnist Jeffrey Birnbaum</a>. \"It was a cash-flow and capital situation ... there was a lack of cash.\"</p> <p>Birnbaum points out that Courson also has a unique perspective on dealing with the government's department of housing and urban development.</p> <p>Back in 2001, Courson agreed to pay the agency $50,000 to resolve an \"issue\" over charging fees to run credit checks for customers. He put aside a further $35,000 to refund customers.</p>",

  "<p>The discussion of the books I'll reluctantly describe as \"dirty\" may have <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/books/2008/07/literature_in_schools_from_the.html#comments\">veered definitively off-topic</a>. But it did set me thinking about which books, if any, <em>I'd</em> ban from school libraries - in the unlikely circumstance of me being in a position to ban anything.</p> <p>There are, of course, plenty of books that I don't much like. Plenty more that I detest. The appalling conservatism of Jane Austen makes me retch (anyone who doubts it - I mean the conservatism, not the retching - should read Marilyn Butler's stunning <a href=\"http://bookchronicle.wordpress.com/2007/09/14/jane-austen-the-war-of-ideas/\">Jane Austen and the War of Ideas</a>, which brilliantly nails Austen as one of the bad guys of Eng Lit, assuming you come at it from a Guardian-type liberal angle).</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Nietzschean maelstrom that is the moral world of Horrid Henry disturbs me profoundly. And I'm sure I'm going to suffer for this, but I also find Philip Pullman's heavy-haunched allegories woeful.</p> <p>The tragedy with Pullman is that he is, without doubt, our finest living children's writer - all of his non-Dark Materials books (I'm thinking of works like the simply perfect I Was A Rat) are entrancing, funny, playful and moving. But when he turns his big guns on the tired old Catholic church, he joins a tradition of bigoted English gothic caricature, going back to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk_Lewis\">\"Monk\" Lewis</a> and Charles Maturin's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melmoth_the_Wanderer\">Melmoth the Wanderer</a>. It's like watching a big game hunter going after the last White Rhino. Not brave and not clever.</p> <p>Global capitalism, corrupt dictatorships, crime syndicates, Tesco, pot noodles ... almost anything seems a more fitting target than the church, forlornly stammering its message that we should love each other, turn the other cheek, hold off coveting our neighbour's ass, etc etc, to a world too busy playing Grand Theft Auto to listen.</p> <p>But ban them? Of course not. Our culture needs books and ideas to breathe and no one has the right to put their foot on the air tube.</p> <p>Except ... Except, there are some writers I'd be reluctant to let teenagers read. Nietzsche can be blamed for a whole lot more than Horrid Henry. All existing morality, Nietzsche claims, is slave morality. By that he means it's the way that the weak protect themselves from the strong. For Nietzsche, that entails a terrible crime against the proper order of things, in which the weak are the corn, and the strong - his Supermen - the scythe. Eighty per cent of Nazi ideology comes straight from Nietzsche. His defenders hark on about the fact that he wasn't an antisemite, or a particular fan of narrow German nationalism, which are to his credit, but they can't counterbalance the misogyny, the love of violence, the contempt for compassion, the hatred of toiling humanity, <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Friedrich_Nietzsche_drawn_by_Hans_Olde.jpg\">the unnecessarily large moustache</a>.</p> <p>So, if you spot an intense-looking teenage boy brooding over a copy of Thus Spoke Zarathustra or Beyond Good and Evil (for obvious reasons he's unlikely to have been tempted by The Gay Science), tear it from his hand and throw it out of the window. And out should go De Sade, for similar reasons. His philosophy is more corrupting and dangerous (and interesting) than the penetrative permutations he works out with such mathematical rigour. The Enlightenment, he tells us, taught that nature is good. Human beings are part of nature and therefore good. (Fine so far.) My natural inclinations, he says, are to torture and debauch young boys and girls. That's natural, therefore it is good.</p> <p>OK, so not many teenagers are going to be reading Nietzsche and the Marquis de Sade, but there's a whole world of books that I'd ban straight away if I got the chance: pink books. Yes, down there with Nietzsche and De Sade I'd place those terrible teeny-chick lit \"novels\", the ones about snogging and boyfriends and make-up and nothing else. The novel is supposed (says who? says me) to exalt the soul, to show humanity what, in its greatest moments, it might achieve; and yet also to reveal our vulnerability and our helplessness.</p> <p>The leathery-skinned hacks who churn out the Pink books present a vision of young people as self-obsessed, shallow, blind automata, swilling about in a moronic inferno. Reading these books will leave your soul as shrivelled as one of those pistachios you sometimes find, blackened, in the bottom of the bag. Teenage girls, read the Bront\u00ebs, read Elizabeth Gaskell, read George Eliot, read anything else - even Jane Austen - but keep the pink off your shelves.</p>",

  "<p>Up to 4 billion people left without water. Up to 5 billion at risk of flooding. Half a billion left hungry as agricultural yields decline by 15-35% in Africa with entire swaths of the world ceasing food production altogether. More than 80 million exposed to malaria in Africa. The Amazon collapses and 50% of species go extinct. It's basically the end of the world. And it's reported in this morning's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/06/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange\">Guardian</a>.</p> <p>There is such a gaping chasm between the matter-of-fact reporting of this nightmarish 4C scenario that government scientists now say we should be planning for, and the total failure of apparently rational people to understand what is happening on the Hoo peninsula this week. </p> <p>Reports from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorthclimatecamp\">Kingsnorth</a>, the site of this year's climate camp, completely fail to scrutinise the pin-striped criminals who are pushing the planet towards the brink. Instead, the Press Association runs stories on apparent conspiracies to attack police with knives without even phoning the accused activists for a reaction to these smears. What other set of people could be accused of conspiracy to commit cop killings without being asked for any reaction? This is a victory for the <a href=\"http://www.medwaymessenger.co.uk/news/default.asp?article_id=46009\">police</a> and the rightwing media they leak to. </p> <p>Equally, E.ON UK's greenwashing PR campaign is run without any question. Every report repeats the myth that the proposed new power station would be a \"cleaner coal\" plant. No one reports that in fact, this coal plant will pollute as much as more than 30 developing countries combined, that there will be no use of carbon capture and storage (CSS) technology, and that the plant will be so inefficient as to waste half of all the energy it creates. No mention of the fact that Chris Davies, the Lib Dem MEP, who is notoriously pro-CCS coal, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/01/kingsnorthclimatecamp.liberaldemocrats\">pledged</a> to attend the camp precisely because Kingsnorth won't be a \"cleaner coal\" plant.</p> <p>E.ON UK keeps pumping out the spin that \"we need coal to keep the lights on\", even following reports in the Financial Times that independent energy experts, P\u00f6yry, have <a href=\"http://www.ilexenergy.com/pages/230_%20Implications%20of%20the%20UK%20meeting%20its%202020%20Renewable%20Energy%20target%20v1.0.pdf\">proven (pdf)</a> that if the UK hit its existing renewables and efficiency targets, no new coal would be required. Even when emails <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/06/kingsnorthclimatecamp.activists\">expose</a> close contact between E.ON UK and the business department, they are only reported in the Guardian. </p> <p>As the prime minister has a last look at a bit of beautiful coastline already succumbing to the sea, the media frenzy focuses on the same old soap opera personality politics. Is so-and-so too remote/young/jaded/damaged to be the next majorette marching us over the cliff? Whoever it is, we know it'll be one of the same crew who got us into this mess and can't get us out because the solutions don't fit the electoral cycle. There is an echo here too of the US media's response to Iraq. Even now, anyone who opposed the war is on some sort of \"radical fringe\", and having supported the war, at least at the time of its inception, is a necessary qualification to be seen as \"serious\". With climate change, in order to be \"serious\" you need to acknowledge that the end of the world is an interesting detail in the broader pattern of economic \"progress\", but never succumb to the incredible naivety of the protesters, who fail to realise that the survival of life on earth is a bourgeois luxury which we can ill afford in these times of economic constraint.</p> <p>The harsh reality is that there is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/carbonemissions.climatechange\">no way</a> we could plan for a 4C rise. No amount of adaptation is going to make that liveable for most of the world's population, and it's going to be pretty damn nasty for those lucky few of us living in the north as well. Despite this, we end up with two possible stories \u2013 the front page banner \"dangerous anarchists threaten chaos\", or, tucked away at the back of the paper, \"peaceful protest passes without incident\". And all the time, not even the liberal press is concerned that, even if every single person at the camp arrived with a heavy machine gun, they couldn't kill half the number of people who will die as a result of the effects of climate change.</p>",
  "<p>The number of homeowners having their properties repossessed jumped by 41% in the first half of this year to its highest level in 12 years, figures showed today.</p> <p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said 18,900 properties had been taken into possession by lenders over the six months to June, compared with 12,300 in the second half of 2007.</p> <p>The figure is 48% higher than the number in the same period last year, suggesting rising mortgage rates and higher household costs are putting a squeeze on homeowners.</p> <p>The CML also reported an increase in the number of borrowers who had fallen behind on mortgage repayments.</p> <p>The number of households with arrears of three months or more increased to 155,600 in the first half of the year, up from 129,600 at the end last year.</p> <p>Despite the sharp increases in the number of homeowners facing problems with repayments, the CML said they still represented a small fraction of the 11.74m mortgages outstanding in the UK.</p> <p>Over the six-month period, 0.16% of homes financed with mortgages were taken into possession by a lender, compared with 0.11% last year.</p> <p>The CML said this was less than half of the rate recorded in the property crash of the early 1990s. The arrears rate rose to 1.33%, from 1.1% at the end of 2007. </p> <p>The organisation maintained its forecasts that repossessions will rise to 45,000 this year, from a round 30,000 last year, while the number of mortgages in arrears would increase to 170,000.</p> <p>The CML's director general, Michael Coogan, said the repossession figures needed to be kept in perspective: \"The good news is that most people are coping well and continuing to pay their mortgages in full, despite the higher costs of food and fuel and the higher mortgage rates now prevailing in the market for those coming off cheaper original deals.\"</p> <p>But he said it was \"inevitable\" more borrowers would find themselves unable to cope in the coming months.</p> <p>Opposition parties pointed the finger of blame at the government, with the Conservatives accusing Gordon Brown of \"economic incompetence\".</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, Vince Cable said Brown had allowed the economy to get \"hopelessly out of control\". </p> <p>\"For years house prices and personal debt were allowed to soar unchecked, and ordinary families are now feeling the effects,\" he said.</p> <h2>Last resort</h2> <p>Earlier this week, the Financial Service Authority said some lenders had been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/06/mortgages.property1\">too quick to take action</a> against struggling borrowers and called on them to treat repossession only as a last resort. </p> <p>Coogan said lenders would work with the FSA to ensure borrowers were treated fairly. \"No-one wants to see a household lose their home, and repossession typically leads to a loss for the lender as well. </p> <p>\"The focus of lenders' arrears management policies today is on seeking realistic alternatives that balance the interests of customer and lender. </p> <p>\"Anyone who thinks they may be heading towards financial problems should contact their lender to discuss their options - the earlier the better.\"<br> Adam Sampson, chief executive of the housing charity Shelter described the figures as \"shocking\" and said the UK was \"inching ever closer to the dark days of the last repossession crisis\".</p> <p>\"We know that behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment, and many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Government urgently needs to step in to prevent thousands more families from losing their homes and provide the significant financial support troubled homeowners need to keep a roof over their head.\"</p> <h2>Emergency help</h2> <p>Yesterday the government announced it was expanding its scheme to provide emergency legal aid to borrowers threatened with repossession.</p> <p>Currently 154 courts around the country have government-funded advisers in place to offer free legal advice and representation to homeowners, regardless of their financial circumstances.</p> <p>That number is set to be boosted to 174 and there are more schemes in the pipeline, the government said.</p> <p>The housing minister, Caroline Flint, said: \"Whilst the rate of repossessions is not on the same scale as the early 90s, we want to ensure that the right support is in place for those who might need it now because of global economic pressures. </p> <p>\"That's why we are expanding free legal representation at county courts, which can make a real difference in ensuring that repossession is only ever used as a last resort.\"</p>",

  "<p>Gosh. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm so excited I can barely sit still. That's not sarcasm, by the way - I love pretty much every single thing about the Olympics, and that includes opening ceremonies, no matter how bizarre and metaphor-laden. So join me for the next hour or two as we deconstruct what's on offer to us in Beijing's brilliantly-nicknamed Bird's Nest Stadium.</p> <p>Some facts about the Bird's Nest, gleaned from the reliable academically-referenced source that is Wikipedia:</p> <p>It has a 91,000 capacity.</p> <p>The stadium is 330 metres long by 220 metres wide, and 69.2 metres high.</p> <p>There was a competition to secure the design and build tender, and the winners were architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron in collaboration with ArupSport and China Architecture Design &amp; Research Group. Artist Ai Weiwei was on board as the artistic consultant for design.</p> <p>Some reports said that there were at least 10 deaths during the construction of the stadium. Beijing officials denied this, saying that only two people died, and four were injured, which is clearly much, much better.</p> <p><strong>12.45:</strong> Opening credits!</p> <p>Ooh! Steve Redgrave! Michael Johnson! Matthew Pinsent! They are telling us about how great the Olympics are, like we don't already know. Then they go all serious to tell us about how bad the cheats are. Then they go all happy again to say that winning Olympic gold is the hugest honour ever.</p> <p>And here's Sue Barker, resplendent in canary yellow, suitable for the Bird's Nest. Do canaries have nests?</p> <p><strong>12.50pm:</strong> Sue hands over to our commentary team for the opening ceremony - Carrie Gracie, the BBC's former Beijing correspondent, Hazel Irvine, and everyone's favourite newsreader Huw Edwards. Seriously.</p> <p>A little bit of politics, yes indeed. President Bush is at the opening ceremony, and he is sitting with Vladimir Putin. Steve Redgrave thinks the protests during the torch relay were fine, and he's glad the world had its say, but now it is the athletes' time, and there should be no more interruptions.</p> <p><strong>12.55pm</strong>: Fireworks! Here we go! Drummers are beating the countdown on drums that light up. The whole stadium looks like a giant rave, with people in the crowd waving fluorescent wands. The timer reaches zero, and more fireworks explode. \"Has there ever been an opening like it?\" asks Huw Edwards.</p> <p><strong>1pm</strong>: Jacques Rogge and the president are introduced to the crowd to great applause, and they stand up to greet their adoring audience. Rogge looks less happy to be there than President Hu.</p> <p><strong>1.01pm</strong>: The drummers are off again, with added shouting. Apparently they are welcoming \"old friends coming from afar\". The crowd are clapping along. If it wasn't the middle of the day, this whole shebang would be ripe for a drinking game.</p> <p><strong>1.04pm</strong>: The lights have gone out, and now the drummers are working with fluorescent wands. It looks pretty good. Or \"very, very impressive\", if you're Huw Edwards.</p> <p><strong>1.06pm</strong>: MORE FIREWORKS. There will be 20,000 fireworks during this opening ceremony, and 600 people are working simply to get the pyrotechnics going. The Olympic rings light up the floor, and then some people fly in on wires. <strong>1.10pm</strong>: Aww. A small child sings a lovely song. Aww.</p> <p><strong>1.12pm</strong>: National anthem, more fireworks. And then they do a little VT, like you get in the Eurovision Song Contest, introducing us to the theme of \"scrolls\".</p> <p><strong>1.15pm</strong>: And as if by magic, a scroll unfurls on the stadium floor. Huw Edwards says: \"It will be the canvas on to which tableaux will be created.\" Some people in very tight lycra walk onto the scroll, and they begin to paint a highly intricate pattern on it. There are a whole troupe of them on there by the end, and one of them does some solo intepretative dance. The centre of the scroll is raised into the air, and then the lights go out. I'd say it was a damp squib, but I don't think firework-related puns are really appropriate.</p> <p><strong>1.20pm</strong>: 3,000 \"disciples of Confucius\" are dressed in what look like a cross between vaguely grubby wedding dresses and the costumes of the Knights who say Ni. It looks good when they're swishing about, though.</p> <p><strong>1.22pm</strong>: I am utterly lost. Now they're talking about the power of the printed word, and Hazel tells us that China invented the printing press, which is why there are lots of symbols moving around in blocks in the middle of the stage. \"We are seeing the evolution of one special character,\" says Carrie (not me, I mean the one on the telly - I've not yet taken on Michael Vaughan-esque third-person inflections). The character, which I can't reproduce on this keyboard, symbolises harmony, which is the theme for the evening.</p> <p><strong>1.25pm</strong>: Now they're creating a reproduction of the Great Wall. And then the lighting goes pink and flowery, and peach blossoms are flourished, and the people who have been operating the blocks in that little performance spring out to wave at the audience.</p> <p><strong>1.27pm</strong>: The next theme is music. Carrie Gracie tells us that China is good at mobilising huge numbers of people, and this ceremony is playing to its strengths.</p> <p><strong>1.29pm</strong>: Four men are doing puppetry, while some others, swathed in saffron, dance around them and bash on drums. They're from the Peking Opera. It's very, very noisy. Carrie says that some people aren't too keen on having this kind of thing beamed across the world because it's so traditional, and they'd prefer a more modern offering.</p> <p>The dancers carry part of the stage, which has a sort of mountain imagery being beamed on to it, and all the while on top of it a lady in a dress consisting of green and yellow hankies dances. No, really, that's what's happening.</p> <p><strong>1.33pm</strong>: The hundreds of dancers are now dressed in blue, and are brandishing paddles. Hazel and Carrie are talking about the aesthetics and the precision of their routine, and then Huw interjects with, \"These paddles are VERY VERY HEAVY.\" Just so we all know that it is fine for men to do dancing, because it takes a lot of macho physical strength. Hazel makes an ill-advised joke about Steve Redgrave giving the oar-waving a go.</p> <p><strong>1.37pm</strong>: Some more scroll-painting, then scores of female dancers process onto the stage, as some huge multicoloured structures reminiscent of teapots are scattered around the arena, and then extend up into pillars, each with people perched on the top of them. Carrie Gracie tells us it symbolises the progression through the dynasties. This is amazing. Even if it is old-school traditional culture, and even if I haven't got a clue what's going on, it looks so, so good. What the heck are we going to have in four years' time? That's a genuine question. Any suggestions?</p> <p><strong>1.41pm</strong>: Fireworks!</p> <p><strong>1.43pm</strong>: Oh, I know who this is! It's Lang Lang, who is a classical pianist. Thus, he is playing a white grand piano, along with a small piano prodigy child. This section represents a more modern era, so the technicolour lights are back on. Huw Edwards reminds us that the more modern lights indicate a more modern age, and Hazel Irvine scoffs: \"It looks like something you might have pulled out of your wardrobe in the Eighties.\" The dancers, who have been closely packed around the piano, suddenly spread out, and their costumes are lit up with bulbs as they run around and create moving patterns, while the scroll shows pictures from today's China.</p> <p><strong>1.47pm</strong>: The dancers have moved in to create the shape of a dove, and then they make its wings move. \"It exudes confidence at every level,\" says Huw Edwards. A small girl in a pink dress then flies into the arena, flying a kite and waving vigorously at everyone, as the dancers move in to make the shape of the stadium, and the lights on their costumes are flashing on and off. Lang Lang is still playing, by the way.</p> <p><strong>1.50pm</strong>: The dancers fan out again, and it's time for the next section of the ceremony, which will demonstrate the unity of man and nature. And I know what this first bit is too - it's a group of people performing Tai Chi. The dancing squad are holding up reflective screens, which are making ribbons of light flash across the arena. Then the huge plasma screens at the top of the stadium kick in, giving the impression of very specifically focused torrential rain.</p> <p><strong>1.53pm</strong>: Some more children are sat in the middle of the arena, acting out a classroom scene, before the Tai Chi begins again. Then the children recite some poetry. Then there's more Tai Chi. \"Although they call this the Green Games,\" says Carrie, \"that IS controversial.\" She then goes off on a bit of recitation of her own, listing the terrible damage that China does to the environment every day.</p> <p><strong>1.58pm</strong>: One of my friends has just changed his Facebook status to say that he thinks \"this opening ceremony may be even more spectacular than The Lion King. Maybe.\"</p> <p><strong>1.59pm</strong>: Remember that big painting they did all that time ago? That's back, and it's being hoisted into the air. And then some spacemen zoom in. \"We can go into space, and we can host the Olympics!\" summarises Carrie.</p> <p><strong>2.01pm</strong>: A massive globe has just magically sprung up! I didn't even see where it came from! And people are running round it! They're suspended on wires, obviously, which you can see when the camera closes up, but from afar, it looks like MAGIC.</p> <p><strong>2.02pm</strong>: I know who this is too! It's Sarah Brightman and her hair extensions! She's singing the Olympics theme song with Liu Huan, and a nauseatingly cute children's choir. Then the fireworks kick in and drown it out. What I could hear of it sounded OK, but it was no 'Barcelona'.</p> <p><strong>2.08pm</strong>: The \"formal parade\" is coming to an end now, and this is being marked with much dancing.</p> <p><strong>2.09pm:</strong> Here come the athletes!</p> <p><strong>2.10pm</strong>: Greece are on first out of the 204 countries competing - and it's by Chinese stroke-order, rather than alphabetical order. Australia has lots of strokes, we're told, so they'll be out towards the end.</p> <p><strong>2.13pm</strong>: Why on EARTH are bagpipes playing? Hazel Irvine enlightens us - a Chinese official saw the pipe band, who hail from Dundee, at a folk festival in France some years back, and booked them. Simple - and random - as that. So they'll be providing the music to march by.</p> <p><strong>2.16pm</strong>: I am loving the suits of the chaps from Macedonia. They look like they've stepped straight out of Saturday Night Fever. And I am also loving the debutant Marshall Islands team.</p> <p><strong>2.22pm:</strong> Don't forget that Japan have a 67-year-old dressage rider, Hiroshi Hoketsu, who last entered the Olympics 40-odd years ago. How brilliant is that?</p> <p><strong>2.27pm</strong>: One of the Ugandan boxers has been practising on car tyres in lieu of a punchbag, and he's not allowed to spar against other people for fear of injury. Get your money on him.</p> <p><strong>2.28pm</strong>: It's SERGEI BUBKA! I really am nonsensically excited.</p> <p><strong>2.31pm</strong>: By the way, I'd utterly missed this, but the athletes are walking on to a canvas in the middle of the arena to leave their footprints. President Bush is enthralled. First Lady Bush is smiling benignly.</p> <p><strong>2.36pm</strong>: Watching this truly gives you a warm feeling in your heart. Everyone is so happy and proud and flag-wavy, in a good way. We're a quarter of the way through the athletes' parade.</p> <p><strong>2.42pm</strong>: Rafael Nadal is preparing for his victorious procession! Watch out for Murray-set boobytraps, Rafa, I'd put nothing past them.</p> <p><strong>2.48pm</strong>: I've just realised I've forgotten to eat lunch what with all this taking over my life. Ah well. Spain are coming in now, and they're a right rabble. They're not marching in line, they're just waving their straw hats at people in the crowd and recording the moment for posterity on hand-held cameras.</p> <p><strong>2.56pm</strong>: The Hungary women are wearing the most disgusting skirt-suits - cream, with pink and red floral patterns. They look a bit embarrassed, as well they might.</p> <p><strong>2.59pm</strong>: We have our one-athlete country, people - Dominica! <strong>3pm</strong>: Princess Anne is in the crowd, looking distinctly flustered as she flaps a fan in her face. She's probably thinking, \"The parades NEVER took this long in my day.\"</p> <p><strong>3.05pm</strong>: Every time Huw Edwards addresses a question to Carrie, I keep looking up because I think he's talking to me. Anyway, the GB team are preparing to enter the arena now.</p> <p><strong>3.06pm</strong>: The Belize team march in. Here's the only thing Hazel Irvine can think of to say about them - \"The disgraced athlete Marion Jones had dual Belize-US citizenship. She may well be watching from a prison cell in Texas.\"</p> <p><strong>3.11pm</strong>: And here's the only thing she can think of to say about Aruba: \"It's in the opening line of the Beach Boys' song Kokomo.\" She could at least have added that it's where Rachel was going to go on honeymoon with Barry in 'Friends', which is admittedly the only bit of wisdom I'd have been able to add.</p> <p><strong>3.14pm</strong>: Team GB! For the sartorially-minded, they're wearing navy polo shirts and skirts or trousers and white blazers. Mark Foster of Channel Five's Superstars fame is carrying the flag. Princess Anne gets to her feet, and waves in semaphore style to the squad. Tom Daley, bless his heart, looks like he's having a ball.</p> <p><strong>3.22pm</strong>: Respect to Kazakhstan, who are all in nice suits and have sashes emblazoned with their country's name across them, and look like a Miss Kazakhstan convention.</p> <p><strong>3.28pm</strong>: Hold tight, gang, the US team are out, President Bush is all happy because he recognises them, and we're about three-quarters of the way through now. <strong>3.35pm</strong>: I hope the Chinese dancing girls are on performance-related pay, because they've been dancing energetically and solidly for the last hour and a half. <strong>3.36pm</strong>: The Lesotho team have themselves some awesome outfits - kind of tiger fur, but not quite, and because there aren't very many of them the TV coverage moves off them pretty quickly so I can't describe them any better.</p> <p><strong>3.49pm</strong>: Roger Federer's up next, carrying the Switzerland flag for the second Olympics running, the greedy lad. But it is his birthday, so perhaps that's OK.</p> <p><strong>3.52pm</strong>: The Montenegro team look like Boy Scouts that have lost their way to camp - they're wearing khaki uniforms and caps.</p> <p><strong>3.56pm</strong>: Second one-person team, people - Nauru!</p> <p><strong>4pm</strong>: We're into the final ten now. I am exhausted, so I can't begin to imagine how tired the dancing girls must be.</p> <p><strong>4.09pm</strong>: And finally, here are the China team - and the crowd go wild. The giant basketball player Yao Ming is carrying the flag alongside a tiny earthquake survivor.</p> <p><strong>4.10pm</strong>: Must be time for some more fireworks, surely?</p> <p><strong>4.14pm</strong>: Huw Edwards tells us what's going to happen now. There'll be a couple of speeches - one by the Games organiser, one by Jacques Rogge, and then President Hu will declare the Games open.</p> <p><strong>4.21pm</strong>: Rafa Nadal is positively streaming with sweat in the centre of the arena. Roger Federer, by contrast, is cool and collected, as ever. All the nations' flags are now encircling the track. We have a bit of a pause here while they build a podium for the dignitaries to give their speeches from.</p> <p><strong>4.24pm</strong>: Fireworks! Yay! The podium's in place now, so we're all set for the solemnities. The men in suits take to the stage to a jaunty little tune, and it's Liu Qi to talk first - exciting historic moment; welcome the athletes, coaches and guests from everywhere; thank you to the IOC, the sport federations, and all friends of Beijing; these will be the Green Olympics, the high-tech Olympics, the people's Olympics.</p> <p><strong>4.32pm</strong>: Jacques Rogge's on now - one world, one dream; have fun; compete with the Olympic values of friendship and respect; drugs are bad.</p> <p><strong>4.36pm</strong>: Everyone's on their feet, as President Hu declares the Games open. The Olympic flag is carried into the arena by Chinese Olympic veterans, clad entirely in white, including some pristine gloves. It's a big, slow tour of the stadium, and takes a good ten minutes for them to get all the way round. They hand over to some soldiers, who march it up the steps to the flagpole. It is hoisted accordingly, and then everyone who isn't already standing gets up for the Olympic anthem, sung by some angelic-sounding children.</p> <p><strong>4.48pm</strong>: Zhang Yining takes the Olympic oath on behalf of all competitors, promising to fight the good fight and not take drugs, which as we know from Jacques Rogge are bad. I didn't notice before, but China's athletes are all wearing bright yellow blazers, making them look like they should be in Hi-De-Hi. Then Huang Liping takes the oath on behalf of all the officials, promising to be impartial and sportsmanlike.</p> <p><strong>4.51pm</strong>: More interpretative dancing, and the dancers are showing the athletes and the audience how to mime the action of \"dove\". Good for them, though, they're all joining in. Hazel Irvine spoils it by telling us that some of the flock of real live doves that I presume will be released shortly died in rehearsal, scalded to death by the Olympic cauldron.</p> <p><strong>4.54pm</strong>: And finally, the torch is in the arena. Obviously they can't light the big cauldron straightaway, though; there's a mini-relay first.</p> <p><strong>5pm</strong>: Legendary gymnast Li Ning is lifted into the air on wires, looking like a slightly too big Peter Pan. He flies up to the roof, where he runs in slow-motion round the rim, still clutching the blazing torch. He gets to the big torch, which is silver and red, and lights the touchpaper. The flames take hold in a spiral formation, and the 29th Olympic Games are officially OPEN!</p> <p>I'm off for a lie-down. Have a good Games, everybody - thanks for your company this afternoon, it's been firework-laden.</p>",
  "<p>The superstars of American basketball, gathered in Beijing for the Olympics, spoke with one voice today and what they had to say will have caused great consternation at the headquarters of the NBA, long considered the pre-eminent league in the world and the lodestar for any player with ambition. Until now, that is.</p> <p>\u201cGrowing up you can\u2019t imagine not playing in the NBA but things are changing really fast around the world. I don\u2019t want to put all my eggs in one basket, business wise,\u2019\u2019 said LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, one of the on-court leaders of the US squad due to start its Olympic campaign against China tomorrow night. \u201cCan I imagine leaving [the NBA]? Yes, it\u2019s a possibility.\u201d</p> <p>James\u2019s comments come just days after he let it be known through surrogates he would consider abandoning the States for Europe if a club was willing to pay him $50m a year, and it emerged today he is not the only restless member of the US squad.</p> <p>\u201cIt has certainly been one of the hot topics of our training camp over the last few weeks,\u2019\u2019 confirmed Jason Kidd, the US team\u2019s point guard, when asked if he could foresee a time when the best American-born players would forsake their homeland. \u201cThe rest of the world is getting better at basketball and the money is there. That is why we have already seen some guys make the move overseas.\u201d</p> <p>In the last decade \u201cforeign\u201d players have joined NBA teams in ever increasing numbers, among them Yao Ming, who will carry the Chinese flag at tonight\u2019s opening ceremony, and Dirk Nowitzki, who will carry out the same duties for the German team. But in recent months, a number of NBA players have accepted offers to play overseas, the most prominent of whom was Josh Childress , who opted out of his contract with the Atlanta Hawks and signed with the Greek club Olympiakos in a deal worth $20m after tax over three years \u2013 far in excess of what his former club was willing to offer him.</p> <p>Other players who have made the move in recent weeks include Earl Boykins, who swapped the NBA\u2019s Charlotte Bobcats for Virtus Bologna in Italy, and Nened Krstic, who ended a four-year association with the New Jersey Nets to sign with Triumph Moscow in a deal worth $9m a year. In all three cases the salaries offered by the European clubs were far in excess of what the players\u2019 former clubs, bound by the NBA\u2019s strict \u201csalary cap\u201d, were willing or able to pay.</p> <p>European clubs have no salary cap rules, and it now seems some of them have no inhibitions when it comes to spending whatever it takes to attract NBA players. So far, none of the league\u2019s biggest stars have been tempted abroad but some observers, Childress among them, believe it is an inevitability. James, for one, has long spoken of his desire to transform himself into a global brand, similar to those established by Tiger Woods and David Beckham. \u201cI am sure there is a team that would be willing to do it [pay James $50m a year]. That just shows that the game of basketball is global now and not just about the US. Hopefully, we would be on the same team,\u2019\u2019 Childress said.</p> <p>Ironically, talk of players like James and his Olympic team mate Kobe Bryant, winner of the NBA\u2019s most valuable player award last season, moving overseas comes at a time when the league\u2019s commissioner, David Stern, has spoken of his desire to expand into Europe, with teams playing in cities such as London, Moscow and Barcelona.</p> <p>The reputation of American basketball suffered a serious dent at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, when the US team suffered a series of defeats en route to winning the bronze medal, but the NBA\u2019s pre-eminence in world basketball has never been challenged. Typically, a league spokesman was sceptical this week about the prospect of players such as James heading overseas. \u201c I don\u2019t want to say it is much ado about nothing \u2026 but it\u2019s not something we are losing sleep about,\u2019\u2019 he said, although he might feel a little less confident today after James\u2019 remarks, not to mention those of US team members Dwyane Wade and Carlos Boozer.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you see Josh Childress getting all that money it makes you think,\u2019\u2019 said Wade, who plays for the Miami Heat. \u201cIf LeBron made the jump then you never know. All bets would be off.\u201d Boozer sounded even more intrigued. \u201cI\u2019m a businessman. If some team in Europe made me an astronomical offer then I would have to consider it. If my wife was down with it, and the money was right, then sure I would do it.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A TV station's news bulletin cuts to a clip of a picturesque green valley. As the camera pans across the landscape the news reader's voice can be heard in the background. Suddenly a white flash fills the screen and as the light subsides an ominous fiery mushroom cloud can be seen rising in the distance.</p> <p>Where are we? Can anyone tell me what country this is? Can anyone guess what's going on here?</p> <p>Learners are then handed a news article that explains all. The headline reads <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/04/artnews.art\">Artists spliced fake nuclear blast into TV weather news</a>. The text describes how a Czech art group managed to introduce footage of a fictitious atomic explosion into a live news programme broadcast on Czech TV last year. See the video clip <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzaN2x8qXcM\">here</a>.</p> <p>The aim, said the art group, was to question the truthfulness and credibility of the media, and the stunt gained them an award from the Czech National Gallery. A Czech judge was less impressed and fined three members of the group $10,000 when the case came to court this year.</p> <p>A news story like this could appeal to a wide range of learners. It may also serve as an effective springboard for the discussion and exploration of issues that relate to, among other things, art, law and the media. Its ability to do so, however, could depend on whether or not learners are given access to the video footage that lies at its heart.</p> <p>For the language teacher, it can pay to bring multimedia news coverage into the learning environment. By including, for example, the video clip of the bogus bomb as an ingredient of the lesson plan, we could ensure both optimised student engagement with the story and comprehension of the text. Thanks to the availability of this video clip and thousands of other news-related clips on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\">YouTube</a>, this is now easy to do.</p> <p>In just three years YouTube has become the second most visited site on the internet, so it is not surprising that it is changing the way that video is used in the classroom. Part of this change may be driven by the learners themselves. On a recent forum discussion on the use of video-sharing sites in the language classroom, teacher Maribel Boender wrote: \"In our school we have a language centre in which all the students have access to internet and multimedia. One of the biggest problems is that they get totally distracted watching videos on YouTube. I try to take advantage of their motivation by using those clips for educational purposes.\"</p> <p>Such motivation has the potential to be transformed into learner autonomy. If learners have a computer with internet access at home they can revisit a video clip that has been used in class and reactivate the language that was taught in conjunction with it.</p> <p>For teachers who have online access in class, video sharing provides a powerful reference tool to enhance class discussions. Unlike standard television programmes, YouTube clips are restricted to no more than 10 minutes. The majority are much shorter, which is an additional advantage for time-starved teachers.</p> <p>Teachers who do not have access to the internet in class can still use clips with their students. Clips can be downloaded to CD-Rom disks or memory sticks and played on computers in class or they can be viewed on MP3 players and mobile phones.</p> <p>Because of its popularity, YouTube has become a vast repository of notorious TV moments, from news footage \u2013 both current and historic \u2013 to advertising campaigns. Last year an advertisement for Cadbury's chocolate featuring a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnzFRV1LwIo\">drum-playing gorilla</a> turned into a global viral marketing phenomenon when it was viewed on the internet by millions of online users. The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSdxqIBfEAw\">We are sinking</a> commercial for the Berlitz language schools chain had more modest success but is still very popular. In it a young German coastguard is unable to avert disaster as a result of a pronunciation problem and it always seems to go down well with my learners.</p> <p>Many clips have become the focus of articles and online discussion or have earned their own entries on Wikipedia (see below). The combination of the original clip and these related texts can serve as a springboard for reading activities. Then there is the musical factor. Teachers have long known the value of using pop songs in English as way of motivating young learners and now they can enhance lessons based on song lyrics by viewing the music videos of their students' favourite artists.</p> <p>Finally, the success of YouTube has ushered in the \"broadcast yourself\" era, as people post homemade clips on video sharing sites. So the next step is to encourage your students to create and upload their own collaborative classroom work. For inspiration, type <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a96TmrxZRXY\">Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar</a> into the YouTube search window and watch a captivating three-minute performance by a small group of Korean children and their teacher. Isn't it about time your school got itself a new camcorder?</p> <p><strong>Video clips with lessons to teach</strong><br>The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5evS-ApSNQ\">Guy Goma</a> incident is a good example of a video clip creating news. This business studies graduate went for a job interview at the BBC's studios in London, but as a result of a mix-up, he found himself being interviewed live on a news bulletin. The full story, which is available at the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4774429.stm\">BBC website</a>, could be summarised and used for the basis of a group writing activity followed by a class viewing of the famous clip.</p> <p>Or how about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU8DDYz68kM\">Battle at Kruger</a>, the most-viewed video clip in YouTube's \"Pets and Animals\" category? Like many viral videos, this one has its own entry on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_at_Kruger\">Wikipedia</a>. After watching the clip of a confrontation between a herd of buffalo and a pride of lions, students could attempt to write an account of it before comparing their work with the language of the Wikipedia entry.</p> <p>\u2022 Jamie Keddie is a teacher and trainer in Spain.

  "<p>For anyone interested in knowing either where their electricity is going to come from in the next couple of decades, or how much they're going to have to pay for it, can I recommend a quick visit to the parliament <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/\">website</a>?</p> <p>The House of Lords <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/lords_economic_affairs.cfm\">Economic Affairs committee</a> have been wondering the same thing, you see, and so they've called in all sorts of experts to explain the economics of renewable energy to them. </p> <p>They've had professors from Oxbridge and Loughborough, they've had people from Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, the British Wind Energy Association, and Noel Edmond's gang the Renewable Energy Foundation. They've had high-up folk from E.ON and Scottish and Southern Energy, and a couple of weeks ago they called in the Energy Minister Malcolm Wicks. </p> <p>And this is no backwater House of Lords committee: it includes no less than two ex-chancellors of the exchequer, Norman Lamont and Nigel Lawson (not a friend of the renewable industry - some of his interjections alone make the whole thing worthwhile). </p> <p>However, just in case you don't happen to have a day or so to spare to read the thousands of words of <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/lduncorr.htm#econ\">uncorrected oral evidence</a> currently available on the website, here are a few of the cherries ready picked for you. </p> <p>Warning: for those of us who always blindly hoped that renewables would be the answer to everything, there are a few surprises in store.</p> <p>Shock number one: If the government hits its target of generating 30%-35% of the UK's electricity from renewable sources by 2020, the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions per year will be, they estimate, 20m tonnes. The UK's annual emissions are well over 500m tonnes, so that is less than one twenty-fifth. And that will cost something like \u00a3100bn. These are government estimates, obviously: other sources may reach other conclusions.</p> <p>Shock number two: One of the reasons that renewables may make smaller carbon savings than you would expect is because of the problem of intermittency. Basically you need to have power plants on standby in case the wind suddenly stops and people still want to have their lights on. You can't really have nuclear on standby, so these have to be fossil fuel plants. Moreover the owners of those fossil fuel plants may not be overjoyed to only be functioning as back up - they'll obviously make less money if they're only outputting seven hours a day instead of 24. So the government may also need to come up with some sort of financial compensation plan for fossil fuel plants. There is much talk about the hidden costs of nuclear, but let's not forget that there are also hidden costs to renewables. </p> <p>Shock number three: In order to have that much renewable energy in the system, we will need to considerably extend the grid. Think of it this way. The amount of energy that the grid can absolutely count on to receive from your plant is called your capacity credit, and because wind farms are pretty up and down they usually don't have a very high capacity credit.</p> <p>In fact, according to one of the witnesses appearing before the committee, in Denmark, one of the countries with the highest wind penetration in the world, </p> <blockquote> \"the Danish head of their equivalent of our National Grid has said quite clearly that from a planning perspective, for example, wind there achieves a capacity credit of zero for planning purposes.\" </blockquote> I think that means that despite all their wind power, Denmark can never assume that any of it will be available. So the grid will have to be able to handle all the capacity for renewables and the capacity necessary to back it up. <p>Simon Virley from DBERR tells the committee that: </p> <blockquote> \"We have published some scenarios in our consultation document, and one of the scenarios that we have illustrated in here, which is a scenario with 32% of electricity coming from renewable energy, the sort of additional plant you need on the system is about 30 gigawatts of additional renewable capacity coming on by 2020 relative to 2008, and about 17 of additional conventional plant. That is just one of the scenarios that we have illustrated in the consultation document.\" </blockquote> <p>Shock number four: according to Bob Taylor, the head of E.ON, the 20 or so wind farms in their portfolio mostly operate at about 8%-10% capacity. </p> <p>Shock number five: according to Malcolm Wicks and his colleagues from DBERR, they will expect to allow a capacity credit for renewables of around 10%-20%. To which Nigel Lawson bitingly replies: \"That is an unusually optimistic estimate.\"</p> <p>Shock number six: this will all start to hit our pockets by 2020, according to Wicks. </p> <blockquote> \"While it is unlikely to impact energy bills before 2010, in 2020 both gas and electricity bills will be higher due to the cost of renewable energy, and it is important to recognise that.\" </blockquote> But you'd worked that out already. <p>Shock number seven (this is just a little one and not really related to renewables - I just found it interesting): Malcolm Wicks states that: </p> <blockquote> \"I should say to this committee that I worry greatly about climate change and global warming, although I think, with one or two exceptions, we are winning the argument on that one - with one or two important exceptions I think we are winning the argument on that one - but I worry more about energy security and national security.\" </blockquote>Not a shock, but illuminating. <p>In fact the whole inquiry is illuminating: the committee has adjourned for the summer now, but I, for one, can't wait till autumn to find out what happens next. What does it all mean? It means that renewable energy is going to be very very expensive, but so is coal and gas (there's a lot of stuff in here about the way that carbon capture and carbon pricing is going to raise prices: no one seems to agree however). It means, I think, that wind turbines and tidal stream and wave and solar energy are not the pure, simple, beautiful things one may like to imagine. They bring their own complications and messes to the table, just like nuclear and coal and gas and oil. It means that finally, we are going to have to get very very real about energy.</p>",
  "<p>It would have made today special enough just to be able to bring you the \"humorous\" video embedded below, in which a spokesman for the evangelical conservative group <a href=\"http://www.focusonthefamily.com/\">Focus on the Family</a> outlines a hilarious plan to pray for \"abundant, torrential\" rain to wash out Barack Obama's open-air nomination acceptance speech in Denver later this month. But that was only the start of it, because finding this clip led me, like Quatermain discovering King Solomon's Mines, to an entire treasure trove of footage in which Focus on the Family attempts to use the exciting new medium of online video comedy to spread its hardline messages. It's all rather too fantastic to put into words, but after the jump, I'm going to try.</p> <p>UPDATE: Focus on the Family <a href=\"http://www.thedenverchannel.com/politics/17166715/detail.html\">pulled the video</a> from their site, but here's a YouTube version.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ztO8wZz029Y?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object height=\"344\" width=\"425\"><param value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ztO8wZz029Y&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" name=\"movie\"/><param value=\"true\" name=\"allowFullScreen\"/><embed height=\"344\" width=\"425\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/ztO8wZz029Y&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\"/></object> </figure>   <p>For too long, I'm sure we can all agree, there's been something unnecessarily po-faced about the religious right's campaigns to stop unmarried people having sex, deny women reproductive rights, and stop gay weddings because of the risk of straight people becoming instantly divorced as a result. Well, don't worry: the era of earnestness is over. Focus on the Family has a comedy saviour, and his name is Stuart Shepherd. (You can find the whole collection <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=stuart%20shepherd&amp;search=Search&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;spell=1\">here</a>.)</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2BSPYK_Eac\">this video</a>, Shepherd deploys his range of cheeky facial expressions to mock Congress for funding something as ridiculous as \"the search for extraterrestrials\" when it could be funding abstinence education. (He delivers part of this video while crouching behind some trees, but never explains why.) In <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVPBwku1B-4&amp;feature=related\">this broadside</a> against Al Gore and the human role in global warming, he uses Chaplinesque slapstick humour to explain why liberal scientists have got it all wrong. And <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs80RD-gagk&amp;feature=related\">here</a>, he introduces a side-splitting prop -- a copy of \"The Wild-Eyed Liberal Mainstream Media Dictionary\" -- to explain why we don't need to worry about the poor. (That's roughly what Jesus said about the poor, right?)</p> <p>Finally, British readers may particularly relish <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7llNz3UR3Q\">this episode</a>, in which Shepherd waxes furious at the campaign to de-Christianise Christmas, and especially at the retailers who send him catalogues that use the non-specific word \"holidays\" instead. His habit is to toss these catalogues in the garbage, which leads him to coin a satirical alternative holiday, \"just for retailers\". He calls it Merry Tossmass. I'm 99% sure he's not aware of the <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=toss\">British slang meaning</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The new mayor of London has cancelled the biggest purchase order for hydrogen vehicles in the country and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7547311.stm\">possibly the world</a>. This dreadful decision will make the capital much weaker when facing problems in the very difficult times ahead. </p> <p>This decision matters because hydrogen is potentially one of the best ways of storing and transporting energy from remote sources of renewable power, eg from Iceland, or wave machines off the Scottish coast. It isn't the answer to all our problems, but with oil likely to remain at over $100 a barrel, this is a technology that is worth giving a boost.</p> <p>For the conservatives among you who don't believe me, then take this quote from the mayor himself, pictured three weeks ago handing out prizes to the winners of the <a href=\"http://www.lshc.co.uk/images/final/IMG_4733.jpg\">schools hydrogen challenge</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Hydrogen is an exciting fuel of the future which is developing all the time, so it makes sense to encourage our young people to find out more so they can become the hydrogen pioneers of the next generation and help find solutions to the challenges we face today.</p> </blockquote> <p>When Boris was elected, I had expected him to ditch some of the projects in the radical budget agreement (14 pages of excellent projects) between the previous mayor and the Greens on the London Assembly, but I assumed that the support for new technologies was a winner. With all the new mayor's talk about human ingenuity providing the solutions to the big environmental problems, I had him down as a techno-fixer. It now appears that this support for innovation only extends to nuclear power, which was the future back in the 1950s and is now a discredited, dead end technology.</p> <p>The purchase of the 10 hydrogen buses will go ahead, as we are part of a European consortium of cities that want to encourage hydrogen through joint purchasing and the economies of scale. Hydrogen buses are one of the many environmental projects that were in the pipeline and have enough momentum to slip past the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4454066.ece\">new gatekeepers</a> at City Hall. I've seen several commentators naively praising Boris for increasing the cycling budget, setting up 10 low carbon zones, promoting hybrid taxis and financing more electric plug in points. In fact, all of these things are continuations of existing projects from Ken Livingstone's term in office. </p> <p>However, this situation is <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7541259.stm\">unlikely to last</a>. If the mayor is to meet his target of cutting 15% of the City Hall budget, then many projects designed to improve and protect London's environment will inevitably be axed. He has already ditched the \u00a325 charge for gas-guzzlers and cut \u00a3400,000 from the groundbreaking scheme, which gives people advice on alternatives to using their car. He has not only dropped the part-pedestrianisation of Parliament Square, but also ditched the visionary 100 public spaces scheme. Despite urging Boris to think ahead and show some leadership, the Greens didn't even manage to get him to commit to the current proposal that all buses will be hybrids from 2012 onwards. Given the many complaints from Londoners about pollution from buses, a scheme that reduces pollution and fuel consumption by over a third should be a no-brainer.</p> <p>A few months ago, I would have said with confidence that London was leading the world in finding new solutions to the huge transport and environmental problems we face. London had achieved zero traffic growth, during a time when both the economy and population was growing rapidly. Many of the best innovations had yet to mature and prove themselves, but we had the people and funding in place to make it happen. As we approached a new era of high energy prices and dealing with the threat of global warming, London was working out new ways of delivering traffic reduction and a shift to a genuinely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/06/london.congestioncharging\">sustainable transport system</a>. </p> <p>London was the future, once.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC has entered into a business partnership with Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson in what is believed to be an unprecedented deal with an on-screen star. </p> <p>BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm, has taken a controlling stake in a company set up by Clarkson and Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman, MediaGuardian.co.uk has learned. The BBC is understood to have paid a nominal fee of \u00a3100 for the stake.</p> <p>Clarkson is one of the BBC's highest paid stars and reportedly signed a new deal earlier this year to stay with Top Gear. </p> <p>It is understood that before he re-signed with the BBC Clarkson was being wooed by both ITV and American Idol creator Simon Fuller. </p> <p>At the time the BBC was concerned that if Clarkson left Top Gear, the show - a brand that BBC Worldwide is pushing globally - would be seriously damaged and international revenues would be hit.</p> <p>A BBC Worldwide spokesman said: \"In relation to the company [Bedder 6], BBC Worldwide decided to enter into a commercial arrangement to better exploit the commercial potential of Top Gear, predominantly internationally.</p> <p>\"This benefits the licence fee payer in the long run and means increased revenues are being invested back into programme making.\"</p> <p>In addition to the presenter's salary Clarkson receives from the public service wing of the BBC, which makes Top Gear for BBC2, he also signed a deal with BBC Worldwide in May to market the brand in return for a share of the profits from spin-off commercial activity.</p> <p>However, it has now emerged that last November BBC Worldwide took a stake in Clarkson and Wilman's company, Bedder 6, in a move that gives the pair a direct personal stake in the Top Gear brand.</p> <p>BBC Worldwide owns just over 50% of Bedder 6, which was created by Clarkson and Wilman two years ago, according to documents filed at Companies House.</p> <p>It is understood that Bedder 6 will be used as the main channel for the profits for Top Gear merchandising and some of the other commercial activities relating to the hit BBC2 motoring show, including foreign sales of the original UK production.</p> <p>With Clarkson and Wilman owning 3,000 shares and 2,000 shares respectively in the company, they will be entitled to a share of the money from some of Top Gear's revenues.</p> <p>Clarkson is the most high profile of Top Gear's three presenters, the others being Richard Hammond and James May, while Wilman has also played a key part in the success of the programme.</p> <p>Wilman has worked with Clarkson since the late 1990s on shows such as Extreme Machines, in addition to Top Gear.</p> <p>Unlike Clarkson, though, he has not made a significant amount from the show and is a member of BBC staff, listed as an executive producer in the corporation's factual and learning department. </p> <p>The plan to give Clarkson and Wilman a greater say in Top Gear and a share of its profits appears to have been put in motion last autumn.</p> <p>In November 2007 BBC Worldwide's headquarters in West London became the registered office for Bedder 6 - a vehicle set up by the Top Gear presenter and his executive producer in 2006. It is not known why the pair initially created the company.</p> <p>Subsequently, three BBC Worldwide executives were made directors of Bedder 6: the BBC Commercial company secretary, James Stevenson, BBC Worldwide director of content and production Wayne Garvie, and BBC Magazines finance director Kevin Langford. </p> <p>BBC Worldwide was then allotted 5,001 shares in Bedder 6 - giving it the majority stake in the company - though it is not known how much it paid for them.</p> <p>The BBC's commercial arm also has 5,000 deferred shares, so if these shares are converted, the corporation could end up with two thirds of the business.</p> <p>One source familiar with the deal said the move helped persuade Clarkson to stay with the BBC.</p> <p>The source added that Clarkson and Wilman were now \"brand guardians\", working alongside BBC Worldwide directors to ensure the various versions of Top Gear and associated merchandise being rolled out around the world remain faithful to the BBC2 original. </p> <p>\"This is putting Jeremy at the heart of it. Before he had no real involvement in the other things going on around the Top Gear brand,\" the insider said.</p> <p>\"This gives the business a P&amp;L [profit and loss] in its own right. This is about pulling together the fragmented pieces to run it [Top Gear] as a single brand. It is rare that the BBC has run a brand on an 'end-to-end' basis like this.\"</p> <p>Over the past 18 months, BBC Worldwide has embarked on an aggressive expansion drive, both in the UK and globally.</p> <p>It has bought shares in independent TV companies such as The Queen co-producer Andy Harries' Left Bank Pictures, as well as buying a 75% stake in travel guides publisher Lonely Planet.</p> <p>Top Gear is a success abroad, with broadcasters in the US, where the NBC network signed a deal in March, and Australia making their own versions.</p> <p>Along with Lonely Planet, it is part of BBC Worldwide's new \"global brands\" business, headed by managing director Marcus Arthur.</p> <p>The programme is often in the headlines - most recently for being censured by the BBC Trust for showing presenters drinking whilst driving during a special Polar episode.</p> <p>The show also attracted media attention over a new pay deal for May and Hammond.</p> <p>It is thought the new deal negotiated by co-host Jeremy Clarkson in June led to May and Hammond seeking better terms. They are now understood to have agreed to sign new deals to stay with Top Gear.</p> <p>Clarkson's agent declined to comment.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.
