  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338955399\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The former Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, has conceded that the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/creditcrunch\">global financial crisis</a> has exposed a \"mistake\" in the free market ideology which guided his 18-year stewardship of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomy\">US monetary policy</a>.</p> <p>A long-time cheerleader for deregulation, Greenspan admitted to a congressional committee yesterday that he had been \"partially wrong\" in his hands-off approach towards the banking industry and that the credit crunch had left him in a state of shocked disbelief. \"I have found a flaw,\" said Greenspan, referring to his economic philosophy. \"I don't know how significant or permanent it is. But I have been very distressed by that fact.\"</p> <p>It was the first time the man hailed for masterminding the world's longest postwar boom has accepted any culpability for the crisis that has engulfed the global banking system. </p> <p>During a feisty exchange on Capitol Hill, he told the House oversight committee that he regretted his opposition to regulatory curbs on certain types of financial derivatives which have left banks on Wall Street and in the Square Mile facing billions of dollars worth of liabilities.</p> <p>\"I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests of organisations, specifically banks and others, were such that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms,\" said Greenspan.</p> <p>His remarks came as Lord Myners, the newly appointed City minister, told the Guardian that a new agency was planned to oversee the UK government's \u00a337bn share of high street banks.</p> <p>As the crisis continued to depress global stockmarkets, the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, also offered a partial confession, admitting he ought to have anticipated a meltdown in the US mortgage industry widely blamed for triggering the crisis. \"I could have seen the sub-prime crisis coming earlier,\" he told the New York Times. He added: \"I'm not saying I would have done anything differently.\"</p> <p>In prepared remarks before the House of Representatives, Greenspan, 82, who retired in 2006, called the financial crisis a \"once-in-a-century credit tsunami\" and said it had \"turned out to be much broader than anything I could have imagined\". </p> <p>He suggested his trust in the responsibility of banks had been misplaced: \"Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders' equity (myself especially) are in a state of shocked disbelief.\"</p> <p>The congressional committee's Democratic chairman, Henry Waxman, pressed him: \"You found that your view of the world, your ideology, was not right, it was not working?\" Greenspan agreed: \"That's precisely the reason I was shocked because I'd been going for 40 years or so with considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well.\"</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Myners said the new oversight agency would monitor the government stakes in Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS, and Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>Myners, who was chairman of Guardian Media Group, which publishes the Guardian, until he took the ministerial post three weeks ago, said the agency would have its own chief executive and board of directors. \"The government will hold [the shares] through a separate agency,\" he said.</p> <p>But he admitted that the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority were doing a \"lot of preparatory work\" in anticipation of further problems in the financial system.</p> <h2>Sorry, the hardest word</h2> <p><strong>Congressman Henry Waxman</strong> \"My question is simple. Were you wrong?\"</p> <p><strong>Greenspan</strong> \"Partially ... I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interest of organisations, specifically banks, is such that they were best capable of protecting shareholders and equity in the firms ... I discovered a flaw in the model that I perceived is the critical functioning structure that defines how the world works. I had been going for 40 years with considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well. The overall view I take of regulation is, I took an oath of office when I became Federal Reserve chairman. I'm here to uphold the laws of the land passed by Congress, not my own predilections.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is unusual to find someone saying anything positive on UK housebuilders, but yesterday came two pieces of cautiously optimistic research.</p> <p>Analysts at MF Global said it was time to look for opportunities and singled out <strong>Persimmon</strong>. \"Our top pick in the UK housebuilders, which we would recommend buying on a two to three-year view, is Persimmon. The group created a significant amount of value buying Westbury in 2005 but reassuringly showed restraint when Wilson Bowden and Taylor Woodrow were on offer 18 months ago.\" These two were bought by Barratt and Wimpey respectively.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch upgraded Persimmon from neutral to buy, but cut its target from 367p to 355p, and moved its recommendation on <strong>Bovis Homes</strong> from underperform to neutral. But it warned: \"We would stress that we are not calling the bottom in the real world housing market, and certainly believe there remains downside risk to short/medium-term earnings forecasts.\"</p> <p>Despite this, Persimmon closed 5.75p lower at 236.5p and Bovis fell 2.5p to 305.75p. <strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong> - where Merrill has slashed its price target from 42p to 9p - fell 2p to 10.75p. </p> <p>Overall, it was another volatile day, with recession worries and growing concerns about the global spread of the crisis. Russia was the latest country to come into the spotlight as the cost of insuring its debt in the event of default soared to record highs. But with Wall Street adding about 150 points by the time London closed, an early fall on the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> was reversed, and the index closed 46.94 points higher at 4087.83.</p> <p>Miners were again among the losers, as copper fell to a three-year low on worries about global demand, notably from China. <strong>Anglo American</strong> reported a near-13% fall in copper production in the third quarter, while <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> lost 149p to \u00a322.40 as talk that <strong>BHP Billiton</strong>, down 57p at 823p, could sweeten its hostile bid proved unfounded.</p> <p>Oil firms moved higher as the price of US crude added about $2 a barrel to $68 ahead of today's Opec meeting, where a production cut is likely. <strong>Royal Dutch Shell B</strong> shares rose 80p to \u00a314.99 and <strong>BP </strong>was up 22.25p at 465p. Among the banks,<strong> Standard Chartered</strong> slipped 46p to 900p over fears about its exposure to any slowdown in emerging markets.</p> <p>But consumer credit group <strong>Cattles</strong> rose 6.75p to 41.5p as it said its banking licence application was on track. KBW's James Hutson said: \"It really comes down to the banking licence now. If Cattles gets it, then it would help to draw a line under funding concerns.\"</p> <p><strong>British Airways</strong> slipped 9.5p to 138.5p after Cathay Pacific denied market talk of a possible bid for the UK airline.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nick.fletcher@theguardian.com\">nick.fletcher@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>\u2022 Market Forces Live: <a href=\"http://www.blogs.theguardian.com/markets\">blogs.theguardian.com/markets</a></p>",
  "<p>Gordon has said it. Mervyn King finally said it. But hard lines on the poor reporter types at the BBC who have been told to avoid using the word \"recession\" for fear of damaging morale. \"Downturn\" is the description of choice for domestic reporters, we hear. \"Global financial crisis\" for those on the world service. The edict went out on the very day Gordon himself said recession - but then, he renounced prudence some way back. Our only rock now is the BBC.</p> <p>\u2022 As Boris takes the flak for raising his glass to Obama (\"Boris Johnson's silly endorsement\", wrote the Daily Tel's US editor), one is bound to ask: will the Conservative mayor turn out to be too liberal for the capital's Tories? The signs are ominous. When Greens in London called upon the mayor to make good his manifesto promise and grant \"a one-off, time-limited, earned regularisation of suitable irregular migrants\", so that those who have been in the UK for many years might be \"admitted to a two-year pathway to citizenship\", Labour went for it; so did the Liberal Democrats, and thus the motion passed. But four of the Tories on the London assembly hopped into bed with the BNP to oppose it. Another, a deputy mayor, abstained. And yes, Boris might be all for Fairtrade. \"I support the promotion of Fairtrade products and believe there is strong consumer and business support for Fairtrade in London,\" he wrote to campaigners two months after his election. Indeed, London was yesterday declared a Fairtrade city. But there is little or nothing he can do about the Tories in flagship Wandsworth, who, asked to agree a policy facilitating the teaching of Fairtrade practices and carbon reduction in local schools, voted en masse against the idea. One denounced Fairtrade as \"immoral\". The same bunch torpedoed another motion on Wednesday that would have supported Fairtrade in the borough. These are his folk and Boris has to keep them sweet until 2012. Think of him. It won't be easy. </p> <p>\u2022 Meanwhile, compare and contrast. \"We should on day one, act one, scene one hold a competition to get rid of the bendy bus. They wipe out cyclists, there are many cyclists killed every year by them.\" The mayor of London last October, pre-election. And then this: \"I am informed that, thankfully, there have been no fatal accidents arising from collisions between cyclists and articulated buses in London since the introduction of articulated vehicles.\" The mayor on Tuesday, post-election. Just fancy. </p> <p>\u2022 As the row rumbles on over who said what in Corfu, there is but one source of solace for George Osborne. His putative successor, Phil Hammond, is smart, decent and wouldn't know a Russian gin palace from a rubber dinghy. But boy, oh boy, he's dull. So the subject of what Dave would do were his ex-Bullingdon Club colleague forced to step down is exciting some attention. Would he appoint a woman - George's first deputy, Theresa Villiers - MPs ask themselves. Like George, Theresa has an interesting ancestral pedigree: descended from George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, who was said to have been the lover of James I. But more pertinently, MPs like to call her \"two-stroke\", in honour of the Norton Villiers motorbike. It starts well, they say, but then it breaks down.</p> <p>\u2022 And though it is not our job to tell people how to run their businesses, executives at Taser - makers of electric-shock guns - may reflect that the sales email they sent to the human rights campaigners at Amnesty International was a wasted one. Optimism is good but this is ridiculous.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, you ask for more and better about the seminar on 1968 being staged next week at the University of Salford. There will be, as we have said, big questions on the agenda. Here, from the conference notes, is one of the biggest: \"What are the implications of previous events and fidelities and how may they be brought to or re-emerge renewed in our presentless present?\" If we knew the answer, we would be halfway to Ladbrokes. But that's us. Children of the 80s. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The grisly conditions facing British retailers were underlined yesterday when DSG, operator of Currys and PC World, revealed a big drop in sales of TVs and computers.</p> <p>The group, which has been battered by rivals on the high street and online, is cutting \u00a330m off its investment plans.</p> <p>Like-for-like sales of computers and computer equipment through its PC World outlets in Britain and Ireland were down 11% over the past 24 weeks as consumers reined back their spending. At Currys and Currys.digital - formerly known as Dixons - sales fell by 7%.</p> <p>Sales also declined in the group's European operations, with the previously better performing Nordic countries down 6% and a 10% dip in southern Europe, which includes DSG's disastrous UniEuro chain. The group is looking for offers for its businesses in Italy and Spain.</p> <p>\"Consumer confidence has significantly deteriorated across Europe,\" said DSG.</p> <p>Chief executive John Browett, who was hired to turn around the business, said sales of laptops had slowed and flatscreen televisions are \"negative in value terms\". Profit margins have deteriorated.</p> <p>This year Browett announced a \"renewal and transformation plan\" that was designed to revive the fortunes of the group. The plan focuses on heavy investment in the stores to bring them up to date, staff training to offer better service and a complete overhaul of the products on the shelves.</p> <p>Yesterday Browett said he was \"being prudent\" and \"taking decisive action\", cutting back capital expenditure and lowering the stock intake - mirroring the actions being taken by many other retailers as they brace themselves for the impact of higher unemployment.</p> <p>The DSG update came as official data showed that sales growth has slowed sharply. Several retailers have reported increasingly tough conditions this week. Debenhams said recent sales were down 4% and this week HRG, owner of the Argos catalogue chain and the Homebase DIY stores, said trade was the toughest since Argos was founded 35 years ago. </p> <p>Sports Direct said yesterday it too was \"battling the toughest trading conditions it has ever faced\" in its 25-year history. Its shares, which floated in February 2007 at 300p, are now changing hands at 37.75p.</p> <p>DSG's Browett, however, said fears of a complete retail meltdown could be wide of the mark: \"I've operated in a lot of recessionary environments ... this is not the end of the world. I'm a bit surprised by the Armageddon-type headlines ... it doesn't feel like a global slump of epic proportions. There are still people out there willing to shop.\"</p> <p>He is pressing ahead with plans to refurbish the group's stores, and has so far completed makeovers on 40 PC World stores, seven Currys superstores and four Currys.digital outlets. The group has also opened its first megastore at J9 of the M6 last week causing traffic chaos on the motorway as shoppers arrived in droves to buy specially discounted goods.</p> <p>Browett refused to say how the new-look stores are performing, saying only \"so far, so good\". He played down the threat posed by Best Buy which has linked with Carphone Warehouse to open 100 vast stores across Europe by 2013.</p> <p>DSG shares, which have lost 80% since Browett joined the business, were up 2p at 25.5p.</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes radio can hit the spot like nothing else, and Eliza Gilkyson's performance on <strong>Bob Harris Country </strong>(Radio 2) last night provided one of those moments. With her beautiful voice set to Robert McEntee's guitar, she opened with a new song, Emerald Street, with its refrain \"the whole world's going up in smoke, hard times coming, I'm just trying to keep my heart right open\", and the combination of the words and music felt like a blessing.</p> <p>Gilkyson makes no bones about where she's coming from, saying that being an American now \"feels kind of scary\" and that many of the songs on her new album were inspired by meetings she convened with Texan friends to discuss global concerns - \"we brought a radical-left thought to it\". Harris asked if she felt a pressure to make every song contain a message, to which she had a lovely answer: \"It's not always about politics, it might be any human story ... but once you've mined a deep vein it's hard to be trivial after.\"</p> <p>Her new album is called Beautiful World - because, she said, no matter how bad things feel, \"I always seem to default to a joy position.\" Listening to her sing, you could hear the truth of that.</p>",
  "<p>In an age when the Conservative party was still seeking to rid itself of a gentry, military and City image, David Evans, who has died aged 73, became an emblematic figure. Born of working-class stock in Edmonton, the son of a postman, he had failed the 11-plus and spoke in an unapologetically east London half-snarl/half-gurgle. But he was also a self-made businessman to the tune of \u00a332m, and a Thatcherite of Thatcherites. His election as MP for Welwyn Hatfield in 1987 was the ultimate breakthrough for his party.</p> <p>Evans's own career entitled him to euphoria. After leaving Raglan Road school and Tottenham Technical College, he had been a professional cricketer with Gloucestershire and Warwickshire, though he never made the first team. He had also played football for Aston Villa, again without making any first-team appearances. But in 1960 he founded a contract cleaning company, Exclusive Office Cleaning (it later became Brengreen Holdings). A natural beneficiary of the scrapping of direct labour forces, the company won the contract to collect refuse and clean the streets of Southend-on-Sea, and became a brilliant success, employing at its peak 30,000 people. Evans sold it just before he entered parliament, after the local party lost confidence in his predecessor, Christopher Murphy. </p> <p>At Westminster, Evans's business instincts could lead him into shrewd judgments, such as his objection to the 1987 takeover of British Caledonian by British Airways as being prejudicial to competition. Equally creditably, he spoke with scorn of Treasury-led, small-calibration fusspotting over MPs' salaries, refusing to vote in 1987 on the nervous proposal of \u00a318,000, calling it \"an absolute joke, not enough to support a family or live the life that was expected\". It should be \u00a350,000 or nothing, he said. He was also untouched by the Catholic lobby on abortion, opposing David Alton's 1988 restrictions bill. </p> <p>At his best, Evans favoured whatever worked, a fruitful sort of Conservatism. But like so many plain, blunt men spoiling real talent, he was vulnerable to self-parody, particularly in the way he expressed his rightwing views with brutal enthusiasm. If there is such a thing as a moderate flogger, it wasn't Evans, who could be heard calling for the cat o' nine tails. His roughneck style touched most subjects: \"I don't trust Russians; the more nuclear weapons the better,\" \"I'm a very rightwing disciplinarian\" and \"under [Edward] Heath, the Tories were all stockbrokers and landed gentry.\"</p> <p>His outlook was seamlessly authoritarian; bad things should be stopped by whatever means would do the trick. Though he never used the expression \"airy-fairy human rights talk\", there was an pre-echo of David Blunkett there, and indeed Evans was an early apostle of the identity card. He made his chief impact advocating a specialised application of this police state tool. </p> <p>Maintaining his interest in sport, he became chairman of Luton Town FC in 1984. With football hooliganism a real evil at international and domestic level - and a source of tabloid paranoia - he had the answer. All matches should be 100% members only, with membership serving as a self-contained identity card.</p> <p>It was an idea perfectly tailored to Margaret Thatcher's impulse to find out what Jimmy was doing and tell him he mustn't. The objections - that the majority of clubs with no hooliganism would have to jump through this hoop and lose money by it, that the police thought it impractical and the judiciary a catch-all prejudgment, and the fact that casual attenders would now be excluded from games, finally won the day. But this crude piece of unConservative central control was a serious runner at the time. </p> <p>Evans had not applied his formidable business sense to working out the longer-term consequences of a scheme with gut appeal, and such emotional responses would betray him on other occasions. There are rightwing Conservatives who, arguing their case rationally, retain the regard of the left; Sir Teddy Taylor is a good example. But Evans's emotions ran away with him. His use of language also got him into trouble. In 1997, he described his unmarried opponent in Welwyn, Melanie Johnson, later a Blairite junior minister, as \"a single girl\" with \"three bastard children\". In the event, Welwyn elected the scarlet woman with a majority of 6,000, and Evans returned to his business interests, retiring in 2002. </p> <p>His years in parliament had seen him rise to only the lowest ministerial level, parliamentary private secretary, in a wide range of ministries - at the Department of Trade and Industry (1990-92), the Department of the Environment (1992-93) and the Welsh Office (1993). He is survived by his wife Janice, whom he married in 1955, two sons and a daughter.</p> <p>\u2022 David John Evans, politician and businessman, born April 23 1935; died October 22 2008</p>",
  "<p>Its banks secured in the warmth of the southern spring, Australia is not news. It ought to be. An epic scandal of racism, injustice and brutality is being covered up in the manner of apartheid South Africa. Many Australians conspire in this silence, wishing never to reflect upon the truth about their society's Untermenschen, the Aboriginal people. </p> <p>The facts are not in dispute: thousands of black Australians never reach the age of 40; an entirely preventable disease, trachoma, blinds black children as epidemics of rheumatic fever ravage their communities; suicide among the despairing young is common. No other developed country has such a record. A pervasive white myth, that Aborigines leech off the state, serves to conceal the disgrace that money the federal government says it spends on indigenous affairs actually goes towards opposing native land rights. In 2006, some A$3bn was underspent \"or the result of creative accounting\", reported the Sydney Morning Herald. Like the children of apartheid, the Aboriginal children of Thamarrurr in the Northern Territory receive less than half the educational resources allotted to white children.</p> <p>In 2005, the UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination described the racism of the Australian state, a distinction afforded no other developed country. This was in the decade-long rule of the conservative coalition of John Howard, whose coterie of white supremacist academics and journalists assaulted the truth of recorded genocide in Australia, especially the horrific separations of Aboriginal children from their families. They deployed arguments not dissimilar to those David Irving used to promote Holocaust denial.</p> <p>Smear by media as a precursor to the latest round of repression is long familiar to black Australians. In 2006, the flagship current affairs programme of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Lateline, broadcast lurid allegations of \"sex slavery\" among the Mutitjulu people in the Northern Territory. The programme's source, described as an \"anonymous youth worker\", was later exposed as a federal government official whose \"evidence\" was discredited by the Northern Territory chief minister and the police. </p> <p>The ABC has never retracted its allegations, claiming it has been \"exonerated by an internal inquiry\". Shortly before last year's election, Howard declared a \"national emergency\" and sent the army to the Northern Territory to \"protect the children\" who, said his minister for indigenous affairs, were being abused in \"unthinkable numbers\".</p> <p>Last February, with much sentimental fanfare, the new prime minister, Labor's Kevin Rudd, made a formal apology to the first Australians. Australia was said to be finally coming to terms with its rapacious past and present. Was it? \"The Rudd government,\" noted a Sydney Morning Herald editorial, \"has moved quickly to clear away this piece of political wreckage in a way that responds to some of its own supporters' emotional needs, yet it changes nothing. It is a shrewd manoeuvre.\"</p> <p>In May, barely reported government statistics revealed that of the 7,433 Aboriginal children examined by doctors as part of the \"national emergency\", 39 had been referred to the authorities for suspected abuse. Of those, a maximum of just four possible cases of abuse were identified. Such were the \"unthinkable numbers\". They were little different from those of child abuse in white Australia. What was different was that no soldiers invaded the beachside suburbs, no white parents were swept aside, no white welfare was \"quarantined\". Marion Scrymgour, an Aboriginal minister in the Northern Territory, said: \"To see decent, caring [Aboriginal] fathers, uncles, brothers and grandfathers, who are undoubtedly innocent of the horrific charges being bandied about, reduced to helplessness and tears, speaks to me of widespread social damage.\"</p> <p>What the doctors found they already knew - children at risk from a spectrum of extreme poverty and the denial of resources in one of the world's richest countries. Having let a few crumbs fall, Rudd is picking up where Howard left off. His indigenous affairs minister, Jenny Macklin, has threatened to withdraw government support from remote communities that are \"economically unviable\". The Northern Territory is the only region where Aborigines have comprehensive land rights, granted almost by accident 30 years ago. Here lie some of the world's biggest uranium deposits. Canberra wants to mine and sell it. </p> <p>Foreign governments, especially the US, want the Northern Territory as a toxic dump. The Adelaide to Darwin railway that runs adjacent to Olympic Dam, the world's largest uranium mine, was built with the help of Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root - a subsidiary of American giant Halliburton, the alma mater of Dick Cheney, Howard's \"mate\". \"The land grab of Aboriginal tribal land has nothing to do with child sexual abuse,\" says the Australian scientist Helen Caldicott, \"but all to do with open slather uranium mining and converting the Northern Territory to a global nuclear dump.\" </p> <p>What is unique about Australia is not its sun-baked, derivative society, clinging to the sea, but its first people, the oldest on earth, whose skill and courage in surviving invasion, of which the current onslaught is merely the latest, deserve humanity's support.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.johnpilger.com\">www.johnpilger.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband, the climate change secretary, is close to reaching an agreement on toughening his legally binding climate change targets by promising to take into account emissions from shipping and aviation. He is also expected to include a commitment that by 2012 businesses will be required to report annually on their carbon emissions. Business is responsible for 30% of total emissions.<br> Miliband was praised by environmentalists last week when he increased the UK legal target to cut the greenhouse gas emissions target from 60% to 80% by 2050. Miliband said he was responding to evidence that the science showed the risk of climate change was growing, and said Britain would make an 80% cut to the headline target in its climate change legislation.</p> <p>But he faced widespread criticism over plans to exclude aviation and shipping from his legally binding targets \u2014 blowing a massive hole in the 80% target, according to green campaigners, who argued that the omission of aviation would mean there was no serious business incentive to bring on a new generation of efficient aviation engines. </p> <p>Sixty five Labour MPs, with the support of Frinds of the Earth and led by the former business minister Nigel Griffiths, immediately tabled an amendment to the climate change bill, due to be debated next Tuesday, demanding that ministers take aviation into account when setting the UK's carbon budgets.</p> <p>Such a show of Labour backbench strength would be enough to ensure an embarrassing defeat for Miliband in the opening weeks of his department. <br>Aviation and shipping are estimated to account for 7.6% of all UK emissions. <br>Griffiths said yesterday: \"We have had very positive meetings with Ed Miliband and Joan Ruddock. They \u2026 recognise the need to add emissions, including aviation and maritime. Our discussions have been about how this could be done. We are all agreed that this is desirable.\" </p> <p>Officials have told green groups that they are working on an agreement to require ministers to take into account aviation and maritime emission, using existing international carbon reporting methodology. A duty may also be placed on ministers to report the emission of greenhouse gases from aviation or shipping. </p> <p>Ministers have not yet reached agreement on these proposals with all government departments, with some reluctance from the transport department. </p> <p>The climate change bill, an international first, is designed to set out an economically credible pathway for cuts in UK emissions by 2050 by putting into statute medium- and long-term targets. </p> <p>Miliband has been reluctant to include aviation and shipping in the bill partly because his chief climate change adviser, Lord Turner, said there was no international agreement yet on how to measure aviation and shipping, or specifically on how to allocate emissions between states. It is not easy to reach international agreement, for instance, on how to allocate the emissions of a Spaniard flying on a Swiss aircraft from Madrid to London. </p> <p>Ministers have said that it might take until 2009 to reach an international agreement on whether, or how, to include aviation. </p> <p>A government official said: \"We are hopeful we can reach agreement with our backbenchers, but we are anxious about including something in the bill that cannot yet be measured accurately. This is such an ambitious and ground-breaking bill that we cannot get it wrong.\"</p> <p>Ministers have also given a separate undertaking in the Lords that they will amend the energy bill to support smaller producers of electricity generation. <br>The scheme will give incentives to individual householders, as well as schools, hospitals and community projects. The bill will include an upper limit for feed-in tariffs, possibly set at just over 2 megawatts. An amendment will also be included to encourage small-scale combined heat and power projects.</p>",
  "<p>One of China's biggest companies will today become the first state-controlled business in the country to join an international agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>The powerful <a href=\"http://www.theclimategroup.org/\">Climate Group</a> will announce three Chinese members, including the majority state-owned <a href=\"http://www.chinamobileltd.com/\">China Mobile</a>, which has 420 million customers and is one of the country's 10 biggest companies. It is the world's biggest mobile phone operator.</p> <p>The other two companies are <a href=\"http://www.suntech-power.com/\">Suntech</a>, the world's third largest solar energy supplier, which is listed on the New York stock exchange, and privately owned <a href=\"http://www.broad.com/english/include/en_index_com.htm\">Broad Air Conditioning</a>, the leading manufacturer of non-electric air conditioning units.</p> <p>The Chinese government and many businesses have set targets to reduce energy used and increase renewable energy. However the three Climate Group members are said to be the first to make more ambitious commitments to the organisation's aims, which include significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, publishing information on emissions, and supporting international climate change agreements.</p> <p>China Mobile has agreed, initially, to reduce energy intensity of its $47bn (about \u00a329bn) annual business by 40%, double the national target. This could pave the way for these and other Chinese companies to publish plans to reduce absolute emissions, and to join voluntary carbon trading schemes. </p> <p>Other companies in China have already applied to join the London-based non-profit group, which is backed by some of the world's most powerful business figures, said Steve Howard, the Climate Group's chief executive. Of 100-150 world-leading companies they are targeting to set an example to businesses and policy makers, around 20 are in China, said Howard.</p> <p>Lenovo, a big Hong Kong-listed computer company, also joined this summer through its US head office. </p> <p>\"The fact that one of the companies [China Mobile] has significant state ownership shows that action on climate change is a priority for the government and the private sector,\" said Howard.</p> <p>The move was welcomed by the former British prime minister Tony Blair, who is working with the Climate Group. \"China is a vital ally in the fight against global warming,\" he said.</p> <p>The Climate Group's members already include global names such as BP, BSkyB and News Corporation, Duke Energy, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, Nike and Tesco. </p> <p>Changhua Wu, the group's greater China director, said Chinese members joining was important in the run-up to a hoped-for international agreement in Copenhagen in 2009 to cut emissions.</p>",

You describe these talks as \"the biggest sale of oil assets ever ... 40bn barrels of recoverable reserves up for offer in London\"; but these reserves are certainly not for sale. </p> <p>It appears your reporters were confused by the term \"risk service agreement\", by which the Iraqi government invites various oil companies (which possess the latest technology) to enter into service contracts in order to restore and increase the production capacity of Iraq's oilfields. By definition these service agreements do not entitle companies to any share of, or access to, oil reserves.</p> <p>The proposed agreements concern first and foremost the rehabilitation of existing oil-producing fields, such as Kirkuk and Basra, whose production capacity has fallen dramatically as a result of air strikes during two Gulf wars and prolonged UN sanctions. The prime target is to restore the fields' capacity to the higher levels which, prior to those wars, stood at around 4m barrels per day. This rehabilitation urgently needs to be achieved if Iraq's beleaguered economy is to recover (regardless of the continued presence of coalition forces).</p> <p>However, it is quite evident that certain vested interests, in particular some in other oil-producing nations, seek to thwart any substantial improvement in Iraq's oil production levels, as any such increase will affect their market shares and risk pushing oil prices downwards.</p> <p>Prior to Saddam's invasion of Kuwait and the 1991 Gulf war, Iraq's production quota stood at around 14.5% of Opec's total production (without Angola, which has recently joined the organisation). If Iraq were to regain its quota share, its daily oil production would increase by 2m barrels, thereby posing a problem for Opec in adjusting its quota system.</p> <p>It is only to be expected that Iraq wishes to restore its former oil production capacity, and it is absurd to misinterpret this as handing over Iraq's reserves to the international oil companies.</p> <p>Your reporters quoted their source as Greg Muttitt, who represents \"a UK-based social and ecological justice group\" and who professes to be \"alarmed that the government is pushing ahead with its plans ... [because] there is no precedent for proven oil reserves of this magnitude being offered up for sale\". But the negotiations in question have nothing whatsoever to do with Iraq's reserves. The agreements would never apply either directly or indirectly to any control of reserves, which remain under the sacrosanct ownership of Iraq. What is unusual about the contracts is that they are set to last for 20 years, whereas normally the service contractor finishes his contract term as soon as the tasks assigned by the government are completed. </p> <p>It is evident from Muttitt's conclusions that he lacks knowledge of Iraq's service contracts and the oil reserves situation. The prospect of a speedy rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry should be welcomed, not dismissed as a conspiracy on the part of the oil companies to rip off Iraq's oil wealth.</p> <p>\u2022 Fadhil Chalabi is the executive director of the Centre for Global Energy Studies, London, and Iraq's former permanent undersecretary for oil <br><a href=\"mailto:forbes@cges.co.uk\">forbes@cges.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>It's inner-city London, but not as you'd know it today. Three black friends are walking down a residential street, which is empty of cars, people, and residences. Behind the wire-mesh fencing and the corrugated iron are piles of bricks where the Victorian houses used to be. A fire burns among the rubble: a beacon of despair. Suddenly their heads are turned by a visitation. Out of the murk emerges a rasta with waist-length locks, a cloak of red, gold and green, and an impressive staff, \"walking flat out of Ethiopia\". His regal bearing and peaceful demeanour represents an example of grace under pressure to the hard-scrabbling youth. </p> <p>This scene comes from Franco Rosso's Babylon, newly released on DVD, which is just one of several films made in the late 1970s and early 80s that sought both to pick up on the energy of the British music scene and to capture the difficult lives of young people at the sharp end of recession and unemployment. Shot on location in Lewisham, the site of the violent August 1977 battle between the National Front and 10,000 protestors, Babylon is at once schematic - issues tackled include racism, black crime, corrupt and violent police, - and highly watchable, with its quick pacing and an understated, tender touch. Its story is simple, following the adventures of Blue (played by Brinsley Forde, Aswad's charismatic singer) and his friends as they build up to a sound system clash. </p> <p>Babylon is a treat for reggae fans: the soundtrack captures dub at the moment when it went synthetic. The contrast between the spacey, psychedelic rhythms and the drear oppression of the world outside is telling. But, like the other music movies of the period - Jubilee, The Music Machine, Quadrophrenia, Rude Boy, The Great Rock'n'Roll Swindle, Breaking Glass, and Take It or Leave It - Babylon was more than a simple exploitation movie. The deal was simple. At a time when the British cinema industry was in serious decline, these film-makers got to make state-of-the-nation movies. For their part, record companies could expand into visuals and sell soundtrack albums. This synergy prefigured the horizontal integration of the media industries - film, TV, advertising and publishing - that accelerated after the advent of MTV in 1981. </p> <p>But what is fascinating about these films is how they all relate music to a period of social and political crisis. By the late 70s, deepening recession and spiralling unemployment had pitched Britain into uncharted waters. There was the threat of fascism, the rise of the new right, a pervasive mood of decay and riot. Youth bore the brunt of these conditions: the first to be sacked, the last to find jobs, exploited and/or victimised by adults and government. Music and pop culture was one of their only sources of hope and inspiration, and it was pursued with a fanatic determination. So within a three-year period, these films were able to explore punk, disco, the mod revival, reggae and dub, synth pop, and 2 Tone. At the same time, they were mostly shot on location, mapping a capital city of dark corners, queasy neons and blasted bombsites. </p> <p>The relation between pop and the outside world had been explicitly heralded by punk, which - after its arty beginnings - took on a distinctly social-realist hue. The Sex Pistols' God Save the Queen made a perfect anti-story in summer 1977: the sound of things falling apart versus the false nostalgia of the silver jubilee. As you might expect from film people - not always totally attuned to the subtleties of pop culture - clunky punk cliches abound throughout the music films of the period: graffiti-strewn walls, corrugated iron, piles of rubbish, the very notion of \"street credibility\" (see the 1980 Hazel O'Connor vehicle, Breaking Glass). This feeling that everyone concerned has speed-read too many Clash articles is exemplified by the band's own \"documentary\". Rude Boy, made in 1980 by Jack Hazan and David Mingay, has great swathes of tedium, thanks to the drunken lead Ray Gange, while the Clash and their principally male entourage oscillate uneasily between bravado, empathy and staginess. </p> <p>However, the social-realist cliches have their origins in empirical fact. London was in a dreadful state in that period. It was a concrete jungle, dangerous and derelict, not just for the black youth in Babylon but for all the other youth sub-cultures, sometimes fighting the police, sometimes each other. The sense of individual psychology interacting with exterior landscape is amplified by the cinematic images of a grey, damp and dour capital: railway viaducts (seen in Babylon and the Madness film, Take It Or Leave It), the inner-city street markets of Rude Boy and The Music Machine, underpasses, tube trains, tower blocks (passim).</p> <p>All feature episodes of sudden violence, whether it be Teds in The Great Rock'n'Roll Swindle, motorcyclists in The Music Machine, fascists in Breaking Glass, or sinister Orph\u00e9e-style outriders in Jubilee. Even the genial Take It Or Leave It features a disturbingly realistic ruck with a gang of skinheads in the toilets of a west London gig venue. Apart from Breaking Glass and Jubilee, this is a male world of peer bonding and martial groups. Sex is taken on the run: a blow job in a toilet (Rude Boy) or a knee-trembler up an alleyway (Quadrophrenia). Only Babylon and The Music Machine have any nuance whatsoever concerning relationships and family.</p> <p>Quadrophrenia is the apparent odd man out. It is set in the moment that the British penchant for tribal youth violence became national news: the mod-rocker disturbances of the spring of 1964. Even then, it's very much filtered through 1973 (the release of the original Who album) and 1978 (the start of the mod revival). The mod gang - actors such as Mark Wingett, Phil Davis, Garry Shail and Toyah, who appear right across the music films of the time - are more interested in mayhem than style. As Jimmy (Phil Daniels) is cast out by the group, he becomes more like a proper, original mod: psychotically dandyish with makeup and jerky, camp gestures. Within the terms of 1978/79, this is dangerously feminised, almost queer, and this is in sharp relief to many of the other films, which summon the spirit of the barracks. Within this, the use of Hazel O'Connor as the lead in Breaking Glass comes as a welcome change, reflecting as it does punk's shift in gender roles. </p> <p>Almost buried under the barrage of blokes, there were many strong, dominatrix-style women in early punk: Jordan and Siouxsie to name but two. Both appear as members of a homicidal girl gang in Jubilee, one of the few films from this period to avoid strict social realism in favour of phantasmagoria. Derek Jarman's film posits a dystopian future where the break-up of British society has resulted in summary violence and fascism. Like Breaking Glass, it touches - none too subtly - on music industry exploitation, but the point is nevertheless well-taken: one the film's leads is the future early 1980s superstar, Adam Ant. The Sex Pistols' The Great Rock'n'Roll Swindle also rejects literalism, partly because the group broke up during its production. It is chiefly memorable for the vivid opening sequence of the Gordon Riots: Malcolm McLaren's chaotic vision of 18th-century anarchy transposed to the late 70s. </p> <p>However, it is the location footage that makes these music films such valuable historical documents. Shot in 1977, Jubilee remains one of the only visual records of London in that year of division. Rude Boy captures riveting footage of a National Front march in Birmingham, as well as a chilling 1978 Tory party conference. Most of all, they depict a curious freedom: a city untouched by wheel clamps, congestion charging, CCTV cameras or frequent knifings. The interzones might be dark and dangerous, but they also allow enough space to move, to breathe, to run wild, to make something out of nothing.</p> <p>Youth is, as ever, hopeful about the future that suddenly bursts through in these films, like sunlight through cloud. Almost every storyline involves some kind of achievement through adversity: in an archetype going back to the The Wizard of Oz, a group of misfits pool their resources and win through - for a while at least. </p> <p>Poised between the breakdown of the old studio system in the early 70s and the onset of public-funded, broadcast led funding in the mid 80s, these music films - whether true document or fascinating kitsch - are all highly recommended, particularly since their fashionability has been elided by time. Their enduring value lies in the fact that, for a brief moment, just before the heritage boom initiated by Chariots of Fire, producers and directors sought to engage with cutting-edge popular culture and to depict uncomfortable social realities. In retrospect, it looks like a golden age. </p> <p>\u2022 Babylon is out now on DVD. Jon Savage is the writer of Joy Division, also out on DVD</p>",
  "<p>Paul Westerberg is recalling the Replacements' finest hour. \"There was one night in Madrid in the mid-1980s where these Gypsies followed us. Thirteen Gypsies who couldn't speak English and had no idea who we were, but they came down until they were practically touching us and, boy, we won those people over. We were the greatest rock'n'roll band in the world that night.\"</p> <p>It's a classic Replacements vignette, a tale of casual magnificence tossed to obscurity. The most gifted, explosive rock'n'roll band of the 80s routinely threw their most glorious moments to the wind, preferring instead to grace crucial gigs with a selection from their vast catalogue of monumental screw-ups: clanking through a set of drunken, off-key Jackson 5 and Cher covers to an audience of influential industry suits, or performing at stadium volume in a prestigious folk club until even the sound engineer gave up, leaving them playing to an empty room. </p> <p>\"There were times when it was done in the spirit of things and was really funny, and there were times when it was just pathetic,\" says their former manager, Peter Jesperson, who put out the early Replacements records on his TwinTone label. \"They bit the hand that fed them and shot themselves in the foot time after time.\" According to Jesperson, the Replacements were simply \"unable to pretend\". </p> <p>\"We wasted a lot when we used to drink,\" agrees Westerberg today from his hometown of Minneapolis, where he lives with his wife and their 10-year-old son. \"Sometimes it made us fearless and sometimes it made us ridiculous, but it's all part of what made us great. We were what we were supposed to be.\"</p> <p>The Replacements formed in Minneapolis in 1979 and disbanded in 1991. Seventeen years after they limped into port for the last time, listing more than slightly, their entire back catalogue is being reissued with the requisite bells and whistles. Despite Westerberg's apparent ambivalence at such an orderly piece of rock curatorship, the timing is neat, with the likes of the Hold Steady, Green Day and the Decemberists publicly lauding the band and often specifically referencing their music. \"We kicked a lot of doors open from what I hear now on satellite radio when I flip the dials with my son,\" he agrees. \"I hear that voice and that garage band feel, although a lot of it sounds crap and forced.\" </p> <p>The reissues also shed fascinating light on the troubled evolution of the band. In the beginning, the Replacements - singer and songwriter Westerberg, drummer Chris Mars, bass player Tommy Stinson and his stepbrother Bob on lead guitar - were just four more high-school dropouts exploring, as Westerberg puts it, \"the American Midwestern punk ethic of No Future\" through a jagged howl of teen alienation. Their 1980 debut Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash is an 18-track, 40-minute classic of its kind, raw and ruthlessly tuneful, its despair laced with the same sense of all-too-knowing dumbness patented by the Ramones. </p> <p>Though he would never deny his inner idiot - witness the song Gary's Got a Boner for ample proof - as Westerberg became a more confident songwriter, his horizons widened and the sense of emotional empathy with his subjects deepened. </p> <p>Listening to the demos stretching back to 1979 that accompany this year's rereleases, it's clear that from the very start there was a bruised butterfly of a balladeer straining to emerge from Westerberg's grubby punk chrysalis. Peter Jesperson recalls that, while he was listening to Johnny Thunders and the Sex Pistols and writing songs like Shut Up and Fuck School, Westerberg was also obsessing over Joni Mitchell and \"slipping me these solo piano and acoustic guitar demos on the QT. It was like this incredible secret. One time he said, 'It's like world war three going on in my head all the time.'\"</p> <p>Westerberg's creative division caused considerable internal tension. Tommy Stinson recalls that the band, particularly Bob Stinson, were uncomfortable playing Westerberg's more introspective material. \"We were full of testosterone, drugged-up drinking kids, and here's Pauly with some fucking torch ballad. It was like, 'Who wants to hear that shit, dude?'\"</p> <p>Looking back, Westerberg can see the irony. \"It's funny now to see [the reissues] with all my home demos considered deluxe, extra bonus, blah blah blah. At the time those songs were looked at like, 'This isn't rock'n'roll. Take this back home, Paul, and keep it in your basement.' Twenty years later, of course, that's the stuff they're trying to sell. It was frustrating at the time, but I lost myself in the whole fervour of the noise, the loud amps, loud clothes and louder girls. That was as much a part of me.\" </p> <p>As they quickly established themselves as one of America's foremost alternative rock bands, they also earned a reputation for being notoriously undisciplined, usually drunk and downright wasteful. \"People would come up to me and say, 'Man, I saw you once, it was the greatest show I ever saw - you were so fucked up you didn't even play any of your own songs!'\" recalls Tommy Stinson. \"And I'd think, 'Why would that be a great show? What made that so good for you?' Chances are it was terrible.\" </p> <p>Following 1984's Let It Be, their fourth album for TwinTone and arguably their peak, the Replacements made the leap to a major and signed to Sire. As they watched contemporaries and tourmates such as REM slip into the mainstream, they, too, engaged in sporadic attempts to \"serious up\". Bob Stinson - a heavy drinker - was by 1985 no longer stable enough to make a regular contribution and was sacked - \"The most painful thing I ever had to deal with,\" according to his brother - and the loss of his wild guitar runs levelled the sound out into something a little less primal and thrilling. Though the songwriting was frequently still superb, the later albums suffered from trying to perform an impossible balancing act: trying to make records that might sell without losing the sense of unpredictable wildness that was what made them attractive. Westerberg nailed the dilemma in the song I Don't Know, from the Replacements' second major label album, Pleased to Meet Me: \"One foot in the door,\" runs the chorus, \"the other one in the gutter.\" </p> <p>\"We embraced the idea of having a hit, but the thing that always got us was our personalities,\" says Stinson. \"We were oil to the industry's water. We just couldn't play that game. Fundamentally speaking we were all doing it for age-old reasons - girls, drugs, fame, fortune - but as you go along and you see people like REM getting successful, and you see what it turns them into, you turn away from it a little bit. There may have been a subconscious self-destructive streak, sure, but when you see what happens to people, and what they have to do to get there, you realise it's maybe not worth whoring yourself out.\" Jesperson reckons they were simply \"scared shitless\" of success.</p> <p>The Replacements fell apart in instalments. Following Bob Stinson's departure, Chris Mars left in 1990, having made only sporadic appearances on the band's final album, All Shook Down. At the end, only Stinson and Westerberg were left standing, surveying a few golden chances that had slipped through their fingers. </p> <p>\"Like any good, young, stupid idiot of a band, we had no idea when we were at our peak,\" says Westerberg. \"A serious amount of money was thrown at us later on, but we were really drunk. Ten thousand people would show up to hear [the song] Alex Chilton and could not believe the kind of monstrosity we were on stage. The label didn't know what they had, but sadly I don't think we did either until it was too late. When we started to slide downhill we thought, 'Oh my God, is that it? How come there's less people this time? How come we have to play a club instead of an arena?' I'm totally fine with it now. I can laugh at it. We just weren't cut out to be pop stars. We got to the party and we saw it wasn't for us.\" </p> <p>Yet despite Stinson's current day job playing bass in Guns N' Roses and Westerberg's increasingly off-radar solo pursuits, you sense that neither has quite succeeded in putting the Replacements to rest. The day before we speak, the pair were playing together in Minneapolis (with a new drummer and guitarist in tow; Bob Stinson died in 1995 while Mars has retired from music), kicking around the ashes of the Replacements' past and contemplating its future. They played old hits-that-never-were like I'll Be You and Can't Hardly Wait, some new Westerberg and Stinson songs, and \"a little medley of Rocky Top Tennessee and Won't Get Fooled Again which I thought had something going,\" says Stinson. </p> <p>It was, says Westerberg, \"fun-ish\". Stinson concurs. Promoters are waving tempting sums under their noses for a reunion tour and few fans would begrudge them a second tilt at it, but there's an obvious reluctance to commit to anything. Westerberg claims he's unafraid of the band's legacy - \"none of this is sacred, holy stuff\" - but acknowledges \"there's a missing element. Tommy has become very grown up and efficient, and I feel I have to bend the other way to add the extra let's-make-fools-of-ourselves element to make some magic. I sat there and pondered for a moment and said the unspeakable words: 'Perhaps this requires alcohol.' And at the moment I'm not drinking.\"</p> <p>Instead, after Glen Campbell covered the Replacements' Sadly Beautiful on his new album, Westerberg is busy writing songs for the next Campbell record - \"I called my manager and said, 'Tell Glen I'll be his next Jimmy Webb' and he took the bait\" - while Stinson has his finger in \"too many fuckin' pies\". At 48 and 42 respectively, they're adopting a tentative wait-and-see approach. \"Certainly Tommy and I could go around as the Replacements and draw 10 times more and make some money,\" says Westerberg. \"But I'm not there yet, I gotta say.\" Perhaps the same strange, self-defeating spirit of skewed nobility and fool's honour that prevented the Replacements ever fully grasping the nettle of fame and fortune may yet prevent them from clearing up any unfinished business. </p> <p>\u2022 Deluxe editions of all the Replacements' albums are out now on Rhino UK. The latest set consists of Tim, Pleased to Meet Me, Don't Tell a Soul and All Shook Down</p>",
  "<p>International fears over the fragility of the British economy took their toll on Charlton Athletic last night as Zabeel Investments, the Dubai-based company who had been exploring a \u00a350m deal to purchase the struggling Championship club, pulled out of a proposed takeover.</p> <p>Zabeel had made \"an indicative cash offer\" for the club earlier this month but, in talks with the Charlton hierarchy, cited concerns with the global economy, and the effects the credit crunch is having in England, as chief among its reasons for abandoning its interest in a side languishing 20th in the second tier. The board had hoped to accept a deal that would have seen their debts, estimated to be around \u00a320m, wiped out. But while Zabeel's decision was not born of anything discovered while undertaking due diligence, the club will now have to pursue their search for potential investors, or owners, elsewhere.</p> <p>\"Zabeel Investments has informed Charlton that the decision not to proceed was taken on the basis that its focus moving forward will be on domestic opportunities in Dubai that complement the current Zabeel Investments portfolio,\" said the club in a statement. \"This, combined with the current debate around foreign ownership of football clubs and the economic climate in the United Kingdom, contributed to the decision by Zabeel to pull out. In addition, Zabeel Investments has confirmed that it has no current intention to acquire any English football club for the foreseeable future.\"</p> <p>That would potentially also represent a blow to other clubs, not least those struggling financially in the Premier League who had hoped to entice new owners from the Gulf. Zabeel is understood to have contacted West Ham United prior to examining the books at Charlton, while the Newcastle United owner, Mike Ashley, had also visited the Middle East to explore the possibility of selling the club to the group backed by the money of Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai.</p>",
  "<p>It's like Grand Designs meets Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, on a scale that would have suited the Beijing Olympics. There's that sharp, sulphurous whiff that always fills the air towards the end of construction projects, and a great deal of dust. Thousands of people - men, in the main - in hard-hats and fluorescent jackets are fixing fittings, putting down wiring, and hodding endless consignments of cardboard boxes. Above us, there's an undulating glass roof, apparently meant to capture the effect of a pebble being dropped into a pool, supported by white struts that are supposed to look like trees. One of our guides enthusiastically tells us the effect is meant to be \"organic\", though whether nature offers any examples of water being held up by woodland is an interesting question.</p> <p>Welcome to Westfield London: 1.5m square metres of shopping centre, built at a cost of \u00a31.6bn, dropped on to Shepherd's Bush, and due to be opened by Boris Johnson next Thursday. The company from which it takes its name is a vast multinational outfit, co-founded by its current chairman, a 78-year-old Holocaust survivor and naturalised Australian called Frank Lowy, who is currently under investigation for alleged tax evasion in Australia (a claim he denies, and which, he says, \"disturbs and upsets\" him). Westfield is involved in shopping centres in Australia, New Zealand and the US, as well as eight in the UK; the ninth and 10th will be Westfield Bradford and Westfield Stratford City, built into the site of the London Olympics, and set to open in March 2011.</p> <p>Westfield London will be Britain's largest shopping mecca after Bluewater in Kent and Gateshead's MetroCentre. Women are projected to make up 75% of its customers; it also relies on the fact that a sizable share of people within a five-mile radius are classified as \"educated urbanites\", and therefore exactly the kind of people high-street retailers want to attract. The essential idea, according to its sumptuous promotional material, is that \"indulgence is no longer the preserve of the very rich\". It talks about something that is \"aspirational, yet inclusive\", and claims that the centre \"takes the purity and indulgence of luxury and positions it as inclusive and accessible\". </p> <p>What this means in practice is an awkward mixture of high-end opulence and high-street ordinariness. There is space for Topshop and Superdrug, but for \u00a390 an hour, those who can afford it will be able to hire a personal shopping assistant-cum-stylist. There will be valet parking and home delivery. Then there is an area known as The Village, which will host such dizzying names as Mulberry, Tiffany &amp; Co and Louis Vuitton, surely aimed at the well-heeled residents of nearby Notting Hill, Holland Park, Kensington and Chelsea. </p> <p>And so to the bad news. Westfield's kind of capitalism is not nimble and quick to react, but based on decade-long developments. Its west London centre arrives in the midst of nightmarish times for the retail trade, as illustrated by recent stories about some of the businesses that are about to move in. Waitrose's sales are slipping week by week. Debenhams' profits in the year to August 2008 fell by more than \u00a320m. The last two financial quarters have seen Marks &amp; Spencer's sales drop by 5.3% and 6.1%, and House Of Fraser is partly owned by the ruined Icelandic group Baugur. With Next, these four names form Westfield London's \"anchor stores\".</p> <p>Still, this is not the only place opening at such a precarious moment. Leicester's new Highcross Centre - \"an awe-inspiring mix of fashionable stores, stylish restaurants and true city centre living\" - began trading on September 4. In Bristol, there is Cabot Circus, a self-styled \"retail destination\" that opened on September 25. Liverpool ONE, a 42-acre development based on 160 shops, marked its first full day of trading on October 1. Similar retail leviathans are in the pipeline for Preston, Cardiff, Aberdeen, Bath and Ipswich, as well as Wrexham, Aylesbury and Newbury. If recent events are anything to go by, their stories will follow the same pattern: local hostility, and questions about the viability of massive shopping centres in such lean times, followed by openings hyped up as against-the-odd triumphs. </p> <p>For the past week, I have been talking to people from the retail trade and my brain is awash with the kind of jargon that can make politicians look like merchants of the plainest English. Everything is about \"footfall\", \"retail mix\", \"psychographics\" and \"experiential marketing\". When reminded of the prospect of recession and shrinking high-street spending, most of them stick to the same rather Darwinian script: the strongest will survive, and that means them.</p> <p>The day before my visit to Westfield London, Mary \"Queen Of Shops\" Portas calls. Her PR and consultancy business Yellowdoor is handling Westfield's launch, and she has been working with the centre's senior management on, \"what I think behaviour patterns will be, just in terms of promotions, events and associations\". But what, I wonder, of the state of the economy?</p> <p>\"Is it an ideal time to open?\" she considers. \"Probably not. But this thing's been in the planning for 10 years, and in the building for five, you know? None of us can predict what the future is, but I do believe that everyone's feeling so flat about what's happening with the credit crunch that there'll be places we'll go to for a lift, to feel upbeat. I think people will go there with their families, to go to the cinema, to have a bit to eat - and in decent restaurants. I'm not talking about Spudulike. They'll be doing fashion shows, exhibitions, retrospectives . . . you don't really get that elsewhere. And in times like these, I want a bit of joy. Don't you?\"</p> <p>Westfield, she says, is all about \"mixing supermarkets, with the high street, with luxury brands, all in one space\". She claims that \"this has never happened in the UK before\" - apparently ignoring London's poor old West End. \"If this means the crap parts of Oxford Street suffer, I don't give a monkey's, because they're rubbish,\" she says. \"When I pass Topshop and I go towards Tottenham Court Road, I want to kill myself.\"</p> <p>Keith Mabbett is Westfield London's senior leasing executive, charged with filling its 260-odd spaces. He says 98% are done deals, and so his optimistic account of the centre's prospects continues. \"What you see here,\" he says, \"is something with which there isn't a comparison in the world.\" But what of the downturn? \"You live through these cycles. I take the view that we're creating something with longevity that will ride these storms. But we're not immune from it, by any stretch of the imagination.\"</p> <p>Most of the centre's contracts were signed before the recent plunge in the markets, but three chains, he says, have pulled out of their agreements, along with one restaurant. \"In the last six months, the credit crunch and the availability of capital has influenced deals,\" he goes on. \"There's no doubt about that. How? More generosity in terms. We've extended rent-free periods to assist companies getting over gaps in finance. Prior to the crunch, we would have offered 12 or 13 months rent-free. Now, on the latter deals, we're nearer 18 months.\" The standard annual rent for an average-sized retail space at Westfield London is around \u00a3300,000, so he's talking about an enticement of around \u00a3450,000.</p> <p>From certain angles, you can peer beyond Westfield's walls, and out into neighbourhoods such as Shepherd's Bush, the high-rise flats near Latimer Road and Wood Lane. Here, residents are complaining about dust, noise, allegations of rats being accidentally let loose, and the fact that work has been going on through the night. </p> <p>In fairness to Westfield, its behaviour does not quite mark it down as a group of ruthless capitalists, though just about every one of its philanthropic gestures has a downside. After pressure from the community organisation London Citizens, it agreed to pay all its employees and contractors the London Living Wage of \u00a37.45 an hour, though this will not apply to staff of the centre's shops. It has also put up \u00a34m for the sprucing-up of Shepherd's Bush green, though the plans mean the closure of a much-loved local venue called Ginglik, in a converted public toilet. </p> <p>Most remarkably, Westfield has contributed \u00a3170m to redeveloping Shepherd's Bush's main tube station, opening a new Hammersmith and City line stop, putting in a new overground rail station, and radically changing local bus services. Again, there are drawbacks. According to some people, the fact that Westfield has put in so much money has had one inevitable upshot: as the local MP, Labour's Andy Slaughter, puts it, \"Everything is now funnelled in and out of Westfield, without stopping in the locality.\" Given that the existing local convenience shops rely on passing trade, this may not be good news - and plenty of local traders are already reeling from the nine-month closure of the Central line station.</p> <p>\"This is a cuckoo in the nest,\" says Slaughter, whose ire is partly based on what he sees as Westfield's cosy relationship with Hammersmith and Fulham's Conservative council. \"They're not pitching it at many local people. They're going for people coming in from Kensington and Westminster, or people driving in from Berkshire and Buckinghamshire along the M40. The implication is that you're going to get even more 4X4 sort of traffic, and fewer people coming on foot or by public transport. They're in severe danger of gridlock, from day one. And then you're on to another issue: can a relatively small local centre like Shepherd's Bush cope with this?\"</p> <p>Cabot Circus in Bristol is a \u00a3600m \"mixed-use masterplan\", owned by the Bristol Alliance, a joint venture between the property group Land Securities and Hammerson. Provisionally called Merchants' Quarter until the name was dropped because of its slave-trade connotations, it contains 140 shops, around 25 restaurants and cafes, and a 14-screen cinema containing two \"Director's Halls\", which offer what amounts to club-class film-going: \"ultra-wide\" leather seats for \u00a312. Millions have also been spent on specially commissioned artworks, and there are 266 new housing units, 24 of which are earmarked as \"affordable\".</p> <p>Part of what's here is a fantastically upmarket square called Quakers Friars, and a shopping street that sits at the retail market's top end. In the menswear department of Harvey Nichols, the downturn is apparently being held at bay. A Gucci jacket that amounts to a posh cagoule is going for \u00a3540. A John Smedley cardigan will cost you \u00a3155; best of all, there's an apparently bog-standard green hoodie, featuring the words \"Billionaire Boys Club\", on sale for a mere \u00a3160. </p> <p>Somewhat predictably, the management claims that despite endless bad news from the high street, all is well. Centre director Richard Belt and soon-to-depart project director Bob De Barr talk about what they see as Bristol's decline as a retail centre, and \"bringing the city back up the hierarchy to where it belongs\". Cabot Circus, they claim, is all about \"the right kind of 21st-century retailing\", and avenging the fact that Bristol has traditionally offered \"a disappointing shopping experience\". If some people look at the lineup of shops - H&amp;M, Next, Dorothy Perkins, H Samuel - and see the stuff of clone towns, it doesn't much bother them. \"You do get people saying, 'All the shops are the same,'\" says De Barr, \"but a lot of shops are the same in all cities, because people like them.\"</p> <p>The retail trade's darkening economic prospects are also briskly dealt with. \"I'd be naive to say we're not being affected by what's going on,\" says Belt. \"But because Bristol was so far down the retail rankings, and we've put it back up, we're pulling people from places where they haven't been coming to Bristol for years.\" As with Westfield London, they say that numbers of pullouts have been tiny: \"one or two\" chains have withdrawn, along with a single restaurant, though I get the sense that at least a few businesses decided not to get involved at all. </p> <p>De Barr and Belt do not like the term \"shopping centre\". Theirs is a \"retail destination\", a distinction based on the fact that Cabot Circus bleeds out into the city, and surrounding streets they are busy redeveloping. The fact that their turf includes open areas points up one of the more unsettling aspects of the development: what seem to be ordinary streets are actually privately owned.</p> <p>\"It's an interesting one, this,\" says Belt. \"These places are quite a new breed. We've applied all the usual rules that shopping centres do, but because it's a streetscape, it's getting customers scratching their heads a bit.\" Cycling is forbidden. Unless you have a visual impairment, should you turn up with a dog, you'll be told to leave it at home next time. Security staff in regulation black blazers keep a constant watch on what's going on, including smoking. \"Three quarters of Cabot Circus has got a roof,\" says Belt, \"so it comes under the right legislation. But I had to make a decision about where the roof finishes and what I'd see as the kind of Bond Street end - and I made a decision the whole of the place would be no-smoking, which I can do because it's private property.\" The public, he says, \"have taken a while to come round, but it's happening now. You see them putting their cigarettes out.\" </p> <p>Looking into Cabot Circus's shop windows, you quickly get a sense of hard times, and the standard retail rules they have overturned. The stores here opened a month ago, but there are already sales at Topshop and H&amp;M. House of Fraser, meanwhile, has reductions of as much as 50%.</p> <p>This isn't the only indication of things not being quite right. The development nudges the inner-city areas of St Pauls and St Judes, but its publicity material talks about 3.6 million people living within an hour's drive of Bristol, 59% of whom are ABC1s. \"Cabot Circus,\" it goes on, \"is a direct response to this affluence\" - which rather makes you wonder how it sits relative to the communities on its doorstep.</p> <p>Marianne Kempf is the chair of a local community organisation called St Pauls Unlimited - and once she has served notice that she is speaking in a personal capacity, out it all comes. \"This is showing up a huge financial divide,\" she says. \"When people step back from the excitement of it all, I think they'll feel slightly different. It's too gaudy. It's too corporate. It's too rich. And it's come at a very bad time. It's all very well boasting about spending \u00a312.5m on art and all the rest of it, but that looks pretty poor when people can't afford their weekly food shopping. That's not being talked about, but I think it will be.\"</p> <p>What she says next cuts straight to the quick. \"What are shops supposed to deliver? Goods. We had plenty of places doing that already. If you wanted a Woolies, there was one. If you wanted some pants, you could get some pants. It's lovely to have a choice, but it's what that choice is. And this isn't much of a choice because a lot of people can't afford it.\"</p> <p>After days spent listening to all that talk about footfall and experiential marketing, her words chime with the spirit of these anxious times that bit more convincingly - though as I wait for my train out of Bristol, I catch a conversation that suggests once the current storms have subsided, Westfield and Cabot Circus are bound to win out. A woman no older than 30 is sitting nearby, talking into her mobile. Maybe it's my age, but her words - spoken casually, as if they're the most normal thing in the world - have a slightly chilling quality about them. \"What are you doing tonight?\" she says excitedly. \"Are you going to the mall?.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday October 24 2008.

  "<p>Lord Myners - plain Paul until three days ago - knows about being thrown in at the deep end. Barely 20 days into his new role as City minister, Myners has already helped orchestrate a historic bail-out of the British banking system and told the bosses of three of our biggest banks that the taxpayer is taking up to \u00a337bn-worth of stakes in their business so they might survive the economic turmoil.</p> <p>The intensity of the workload has been extraordinary but there is little time to rest. Insurance companies and hedge funds are now being scrutinised. A crucial bill to update a bank regulatory system exposed by Northern Rock's collapse last year must be raced through parliament as the government tries to marshal an international response to the crisis.</p> <p>Myners, who until he took ministerial office was chairman of Guardian Media Group, which publishes the Guardian, will be in the thick of it as Alistair Darling's point man with the City. The Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, admitted this week that the banking system had been the closest to collapse since the first world war, but Myners insists: \"We are now in a much better place. That's not to say everything has been addressed. We remain alert to shocks [but] I feel we are on top of the situation in terms of anticipating where challenges could arise.\"</p> <p>His appointment on October 3 came as part of Gordon Brown's ministerial reshuffle, which also heralded Peter Mandelson's surprise return to the cabinet. Myners' involvement in Brown's emergency changes also raised eyebrows. The 60-year-old businessman, who favours open-neck shirts rather than ties, held a string of top jobs and forfeited \u00a31m of income to take on the role. As well as chairman's roles at GMG, the FTSE-100 property company Land Securities and the Tate Gallery trustees, he resigned as a director from GLG, a hedge fund that profited from placing bets that bank stocks would fall. Such short-selling is now temporarily banned by the City regulator, allowing the Conservatives to accuse Brown of hypocrisy.</p> <p>When Myners joined the government he knew he would be thrown headlong into the crisis - which had yet to reach its climax - at Britain's banks. \"I'm a minor support act for the chancellor but I knew I was coming into his team with a specific responsibility in this area.\" His immediate brief was to work with Darling to re-establish confidence in the British banking system.</p> <p><strong>Orphanage</strong></p> <p>Described as having a ferocious temper and a considerable ego, Myners has had some experience of a banking crisis before. He was a reporter at the Daily Telegraph during the banks' last big wobble in 1973. His view is that the secondary banking crisis - which affected dozens of smaller banks - \"was infinitely simpler\" than the current one. Did he get scoops? \"Yeah,\" he says. Was he a good reporter? \"I made up for lack of flair and skill with energy and hard work, and I think that's often been a feature of my life.\"</p> <p>Adopted from a Bath orphanage by a Cornish couple - he told the Guardian in the past that \"I know nothing about my natural parents; I don't wish to\" - he went to school in Truro and did a degree in education. He taught for a while, did a stint in the City and after the Telegraph, joined NM Rothschild where he spent 10 years before joining fund manager Gartmore. It was here he made his name in the City and an estimated \u00a330m fortune. In 2000 he went plural, taking several boardroom seats including the chairmanship of Marks &amp; Spencer as it faced down a potential bid from the retailer Sir Philip Green. </p> <p>The experience with Green - who said he wanted to give Myners \"a proper fucking kick in the head\" the night he dropped his bid - has left its mark on the new City minister in his frantic efforts to prop up the ailing banks. </p> <p>\"In my working life I've been through many critical days. The one that springs to mind is around the Philip Green bid for M&amp;S. This [bank rescue] is no different in that there are days of great intensity when you know that there are crucial moments,\" says Myners, who reluctantly resigned from M&amp;S after another director queried his friendship with the chief executive, Sir Stuart Rose</p> <p>At ease with the media, his answers are fluid and well rehearsed. He is quick to express an opinion. Before taking this role, he laid into the boards of British banks and criticised private equity firms. Uncharacteristically, he stumbles when asked who can be blamed for the current crisis. He starts well: \"It's a global phenomenon ... It's a situation where everybody has lessons to learn.\" On the Financial Services Authority, which admitted its poor handling of the Northern Rock affair, he says: \"Adair [Turner, FSA chairman] is talking about the need to change the way the FSA defines its role and the Treasury is working with him on that.\"</p> <p>When he gets to the Bank of England, he \"struggles\". Until three weeks ago he was a member of its Court - equivalent to a company's board. The silences speak volumes. It takes 15 seconds before he says: \"I think\"; five more to begin: \"The Bank of England has some lessons to learn ...\" before trailing off again. A minute later, he has his lines: \"The Bank of England has two core responsibilities: monetary policy and financial stability. [With] monetary policy, it has clearly performed its role to extraordinarily high standards. On financial stability, it has been hampered by the limited instruments available to it, which is one of the reasons we're proposing new legislation to give the bank more power to perform its statutory obligations,\" he says, relieved at finding the politician's answer.</p> <p><strong>Social justice</strong></p> <p>Although he says he never aspired to a political life and only joined the Labour party to take on the City minister role, he has led several government reviews. \"I've always been deeply concerned about equity and social justice,\" he says - liberal with a small l.</p> <p>He cites his role as chairman of the Low Pay Commission as evidence of his concern about pay inequality. But he rejects the idea that taxpayers' stakes in banks could be used to re-engineer the social order. \"The government doesn't have a policy objective to own banks ... they are not agencies of social change. The government has other instruments to achieve those goals.\"</p> <p>The government is forcing the bail-out banks - Royal Bank of Scotland and the combined Lloyds TSB and HBOS - to put lending back on a 2007 footing to keep the financing tap on for small business and would-be home-owners during the oncoming recession. The government will also get some say over appointments to boards and secured pledges that bosses will not get bonuses. </p> <p>The exact way the government will oversee the \u00a337bn at risk is still being ironed out, but Myners reveals a new agency is likely to be created similar to the Shareholder Executive set up in 2003 to oversee government stakes in businesses such as the Tote, Channel Four and the Met Office. It has since nationalised Northern Rock and it is not clear whether this stake will be under the new agency.</p> <p>Myners reckons the insurers and the hedge fund industry are not in the state in which the banks ended up a fortnight ago. \"We are watching those situations carefully,\" he admits, but insists the taxpayer will not have to prop them up. He puts the onus on the FSA, which he says has \"taken some major steps across all its areas of responsibility to revisit areas of capitalisation\".</p> <p>He does not take issue with the idea he has a bad temper but prefers to call himself passionate. But he is affronted by the idea that he has a big ego or is a major networker, insisting he is not a fan of cocktail parties - not least because he is being fitted with a hearing aid.</p> <p>It is not clear how long Myners, who is not taking a ministerial salary, hopes to be City minister, a role that until a year ago would have been more about defending taxing non-doms or big firms threatening to leave the UK for more relaxed tax regimes than fighting for the City's survival. He is doing it out of a sense of public duty as his wealth means he does not need to work. \"I just like to be involved. I love challenges and can't contemplate how one could be satisfied sitting on the beach,\" he says.</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born </strong>April 1 1948</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Truro School; Institute of Education, University of London</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> Daily Telegraph (1970-74); NM Rothschild (1974-85); Gartmore (1985-2000); mmO2 (2001-04); Marks &amp; Spencer (2002-06); chairman, Guardian Media Group (2000-08); chairman, Land Securities (2006-08); Court of Bank of England (2005...#8209;08); City minister (October 2008-)</p> <p><strong>Family </strong>Married to Alison, with whom he has a son and a daughter, and three daughters from a previous marriage </p> <p><strong>Interests</strong> The arts</p>",
  "<p>Sex education is to be made a compulsory part of the national curriculum in primary and secondary schools under government plans to cut teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections.</p> <p>All children in state schools in England will learn about body parts and animal reproduction from the age of five, puberty and intercourse from the age of seven and pregnancy, contraception and safer sex from the age of 11. The new curriculum will attempt to stop sex education being consigned to biology lessons and ensure that children learn about relationships and the option of abstinence along with the facts of life. </p> <p>Ministers indicated that schools would not be allowed to opt out of the rules. Faith schools will receive separate guidance on how to provide sex and relationship education - which will include contraception, abortion and homosexuality - alongside conflicting religious beliefs.</p> <p>Jim Knight, the schools minister, said he wanted all schools to teach children more about sex in the context of relationships, including marriage and civil partnerships. He said he hoped better education would help teenagers make more informed decisions about when to have sex and delay losing their virginity. But he denied that the lessons would include learning about specific sexual activities from a very young age. </p> <p>\"We are not talking about five-year-olds being taught about sex. At key stage one [ages five to seven] they will be learning about themselves, their differences, their friendships, how to have strong friendships and how to manage their feelings.\"</p> <p>Secondary schools currently only have to teach the mechanics of sex in biology classes, and not in conjunction with relationships and sexual health. Most schools teach personal, social and health education (PSHE) but it is not compulsory and quality is highly variable. </p> <p>A recent survey of pupils revealed that four in 10 had received no sex education at school. </p> <p>England has some of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in Europe and sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia, are soaring. Wales and Northern Ireland already have compulsory sex education.</p> <p>The new compulsory PSHE curriculum, expected by 2010, will also include learning about the risk of drugs and alcohol, how to manage money and how to maintain a healthy diet. Parents should be informed about the contents of sex education classes, Knight said. There will be a drive to improve the teaching of classes, using dedicated teachers and training.</p> <p>The government's announcement follows recommendations in an independent review undertaken by representatives from groups spanning the sexual health charities as well as faith groups and schools. </p> <p>A new review led by Sir Alasdair MacDonald, an east London headteacher, will investigate further how to implement the plan and consider whether parents or even schools should be given an opt-out where there is a religious or moral objection. But Knight said: \"We wouldn't be suggesting a statutory programme of study if we thought schools would have an opt-out.</p> <p>\"There are some that argue having an opt-out for parents for the national curriculum is difficult, but I think it is important that individual parents' views are taken into account and their right to withdraw because of personal or moral views is respected. It's something it would take a lot for us to move away from.\"</p> <p>He said that supplementary guidance would be produced for Catholic schools advising them that they too must teach all elements of the curriculum alongside Catholic values about contraception, abortion and homosexuality.</p> <p>The Catholic Education Service denied that this could result in mixed messages for pupils if they were being taught the facts of contraception, then that it was frowned upon. Oona Stannard, director of the CES, said: \"Young people have a right to have age-appropriate information. We can similarly ensure that they are taught the values of their religious faith.\"</p> <p>Sexual health campaigners were thrilled that decades of campaigning for compulsory sex education had come to fruition. Julie Bentley, chief executive of FPA, formerly the Family Planning Association, said: \"This is a momentous decision. This move will dramatically improve the long-term health and wellbeing of our children and young people.\"</p> <p>Simon Blake, chief executive of the sexual health charity Brook, said it was an \"absolutely brilliant\" move. \"It shows a progressive and bold government that has taken notice of the views of children and young people.\"</p> <p>However, a minority of traditional family campaigners opposed the decision. Stephen Green, national director of Christian Voice, said the proposals would only \"encourage experimentation\" and contribute to the rise in teenage pregnancy and infertility.</p> <p>Headteachers launched an outspoken attack on the plans. John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he regretted that ministers had not responded to his pleas for them not to overcrowd the curriculum with more compulsory subjects and had instead chosen to listen to a minority. </p> <p>\"All special interest groups believe that their subject is the most important,\" he said. \"Regrettably, governments have a horrible habit of making more and more things compulsory and increasing the constraints on state schools.\"</p> <h2>What they will learn</h2> <p>The facts of life - and when children will learn them</p> <p><strong>By age seven children will be able to:</strong></p> <p>Name the main parts of the body.</p> <p>Recognise how their behaviour affects other people.</p> <p>Know that families and friends should care for each other.</p> <p>Understand that animals reproduce.</p> <p><strong>By 11</strong></p> <p>Teachers should be ready to answer questions about sexual intercourse.</p> <p>Children should know about the physical changes of puberty.</p> <p>Recognise that puberty affects people's emotions and how to deal with their feelings and relationships.</p> <p>Judge what kind of physical contact is acceptable or unacceptable.</p> <p>Resist peer pressure.</p> <p>Be aware of different types of relationships.</p> <p><strong>By 16</strong></p> <p>Understand sexual activity, human reproduction, contraception, pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases.</p> <p>Learn about relationships, that they can cause strong feelings. </p> <p>Have an idea about positive and stable relationships.</p> <p>Know that there are different types of relationships, including same-sex and civil partnerships.</p> <p>Recognise the importance of marriage and stable relationships for bringing up children.</p>",
  "<p>Although there are other problems with livestock that run it close, flystrike has to be one of the most unpleasant problems to deal with. It usually occurs in warm and sultry summer conditions and strikes your very best lambs. Bluebottles, or similar fly variants, land on sheep, lay eggs - usually but not always in dung-stained wool - and a few days later the sheep is alive with maggots, burrowing into the skin. Ewes affected tend to separate themselves from the flock and lie down under a hedge, traumatised and ready to give up and die. There is no easy way to deal with the problem. The maggots have to be picked out laboriously one by one, a sterilising wash liberally applied, and a yellow soothing balm from the farm pharmaceutical shelves then smeared on for the comfort of the ovine patient.</p> <p>All this came back to me from our 10 years of fun farming when I saw Ken, the owner of the black Welsh mountain flock, on a Sunday morning earlier in the month. He looked up from examining one ewe to tell me that three of his flock were flystruck - the ram, Mario, and two of the ewes. \"What did you do?\" he asked, knowing of my familiarity with the breed and the problem. When I was back at home after completing my bike ride, I asked my wife, at one time the lady shepherdess with the nimble fingers that sorted out flystrike.</p> <p>I phoned Ken with the advice, and three days later, again passing on my bike, I found all was well. The treated sheep were all in recovery and plans for a new ram to join the flock on Mario's retirement were in progress. Reflecting on the incident, I was surprised by the stage in the year at which this had occurred. A problem I associated with warm summer days had still been around in autumn temperatures. Is this another global warming effect?</p>",
  "<p>Mecom, the newspaper group run by the former Mirror Group chief executive David Montgomery, warned yesterday that its full-year earnings would fall 10% below market expectations amid a Europe-wide slump in advertising revenue. </p> <p>The company, which has operations in five European countries, said its debt rose by \u00a341m to \u00a3587m by the end of last month, dwarfing its market value, which stood at about \u00a358m last night after its shares plunged almost a quarter to 3.7p.</p> <p>In an unscheduled interim management statement, Mecom said it was complying with banking covenants and that it wanted to cut debt \"to a more appropriate level for the current economic environment\". </p> <p>The housebroker Numis said Mecom's debt-to-earnings ratio was \"too close for comfort\" and warned it may breach covenants unless it sold some businesses. </p> <p>Mecom said it had received \"a number of expressions of interest\" for various assets. These are thought to include four approaches for its Norwegian business, Edda Media, and talks about its Dutch subsidiary AD NieuwsMedia. German group Axel Springer is reported to be interested in Mecom's 51% share of Presspublica, the owner of Polish daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita, and there are several possible bidders for Danish advertising agency SP3.</p> <p>Mecom said advertising revenue had dived 7.2% in the three months to the end of September, falling everywhere except Poland. The decline in September was 9%, and this deterioration had set in for the rest of the year, the company warned.</p> <p>\"A number of cost initiatives have been accelerated in recent months, but these will not be sufficient to offset the effect of lower advertising revenue,\" Mecom said.</p> <p>Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation would fall by about 10% below market expectations, the company added.</p> <p>\"The deterioration in global economic activity is being reflected in a recent slowdown in advertising performance and a weakening in the market outlook,\" said Montgomery, executive chairman. </p> <p>The advertising market was at its worst in Denmark, where revenue fell 15.6% on an underlying basis in the third quarter - widening from 13% in the first half of the year - and in Germany, which recorded a 6.1% decline. </p> <p>Across the group, circulation revenue rose 4% in the three-month period, while overall like-for-like revenue fell 2.6%.</p>",
  "<p>Credit Suisse yesterday warned of further squeezes on the banking sector as the Swiss bank confirmed it had lost SFr1.3bn (\u00a3682m) in the third quarter of this year.</p> <p>Chief executive Brady Dougan said: \"We expect the market environment to remain very challenging and we are cautious with regard to the outlook for the fourth quarter.\" </p> <p>He said the third-quarter figures were \"understandable\" in the financial turmoil but \"clearly disappointing\".</p> <p>Last year Credit Suisse made a net profit of SFr1.3bn in the July-September period. This time, revenue for the three months almost halved from SFr6.02bn to SFr3.11bn.</p> <p>Switzerland's second-biggest bank this month raised SFr10bn in fresh capital from investors, including a sovereign wealth fund, while bigger rival UBS had to ask the government for \u00a337bn to dispose of toxic assets, which have helped trigger the world financial crisis. </p> <p>Credit Suisse is the first of the big European banks to report this quarter. Yesterday it confirmed write-downs in leveraged finance and structured products of SFr2.4bn in investment banking, which lost SFr3.2bn pre-tax in the quarter. But the bank said it had reduced its exposure to most toxic assets at the same time.</p> <p>Dougan said Credit Suisse was working hard to reduce liabilities, but the bank is still sitting on leveraged loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities and sub-prime assets worth SFr31.5bn, down from SFr35.8bn last quarter.</p> <p>Exposure to leveraged finance fell from SFr14.3bn to SFr11.9bn at the end of September, the month when full-scale panic gripped global markets. Similarly, exposure to commercial mortgages fell from SFr15bn to SFr12.8bn while that to residential mortgages/sub-prime collateralised debt obligations rose slightly from SFr6.5bn to SFr6.8bn.</p> <p>Institutional investors withdrew some SFr16.5bn from the bank's asset management division during the quarter, but deposits in its private banking business saw a net increase of SFr14.5bn, a sign, Dougan said, the bank retains considerable trust among individual customers.</p> <p>Total assets under management stand at SFr1.4tn, down 13% on the corresponding period last year.</p> <p>UBS has also reported huge customer withdrawals in recent months as it struggles to turn around its business after losses and heavy write-downs since the start of the sub-prime crisis last year.</p> <p>Shares in Credit Suisse dropped 6.1% to SFr43.70 on Zurich's stock exchange.</p>",
  "<p>What a surprise. As the credit crunch moves slightly down the headlines it is replaced as top story by a tale of shady dealings about the raising of cash for politics (Don't cross me again, warns Tory's accuser, October 23). Whatever George Osborne may or may not have done, the spectacle of our senior politicians cosying up to money men to fund party political activities should be a source of shame and embarrassment to all of us.</p> <p>Meaningful reform of political-party funding is scuppered time after time by one party or another refusing to let go of its own special funding relationships. The bill now going through parliament will do little to change the fundamental problem, which leads politicians of all persuasions to court those with money in order to fund their party. The status quo is justified by the apparent agreement across the political spectrum that people will not accept more state funding because our politicians are held in such low esteem. Well, that problem is not going to be improved by continuing this unsightly and sometimes rather seedy method of paying for our democracy.</p> <p>We need a system that is transparent and which prevents any of our political parties being beholden to particular vested interests. Crucially, we need a system which rewards those parties who seek to engage with individual voters in a way our current method of party political funding fails miserably to do.</p> <p>The Power Inquiry suggested a system which gave every voter the chance to determine who got a portion of state funding - which would be spent locally rather than consumed by party headquarters bent on expensive media campaigns. Others have different ideas. But what is certain is that if we are to have a new type of politics in this country, we need to start by reforming where the money for politics actually comes from.<br><strong>Pam Giddy</strong><br>Director, Power Inquiry </p> <p>Neat, is it not? George Osborne is alleged to be part of a Tory attempt to channel a foreign donation from a Russian billionaire to his party and the Electoral Commission immediately dismisses a request to investigate. Peter Hain goes to the commission as soon as he finds that those he trusted to run his Labour party deputy leader campaign have failed to register legal British donations within the required 30 days and the commission refers him to the police. One law for a Tory, another for Labour? No wonder many of us are so cynical.<br><strong>Karen Price</strong><br>Neath, West Glamorgan </p> <p>George Osborne's indiscreet breach of the omerta of an upper-class binge-drinking club has at least helped us all learn the difference between a superyacht and a megayacht. More importantly, their falling out has lifted a stone to uncover how our increasingly interconnected economic and political upper-class spend their money and time.</p> <p>All parties - the economic patrons and their political lapdogs - appear to have agreed a truce rather than risk damaging their collective reputation. Discretion in their discussions with each other obviously counts for more than transparency and accountability to the rest of us. Besides, now is probably not the best time for the \"have-yachts\" to rub our noses in the details of all these marvellous parties they throw for each other.</p> <p>We are used to dodgy unaccountable offshore financial arrangements, but now the politics is disappearing offshore and there seems to be nothing we can do about it.

  "<p>\"Dog whistle tactics\" has become something of a political cliche, but three years ago, the term - which means campaigning on issues so high-pitched that only certain voters can hear them - was all but unheard-of.</p> <p>It took Phil Woolas, a one-time TV producer, trade union official and Labour MP, to point out that the mix of immigration and health in Michael Howard's 2005 election campaign had been developed in Australia and had a name. After a few lunches with political journalists, the idea of \"dog whistle tactics\" entered the political lexicon.</p> <p>Woolas might have been quick to spot it because he does a good line in whistling. Within 10 days of becoming immigration minister this month, Woolas went on record to say he believed immigration should be limited and the British population capped at 70 million. A little further from his brief, he also floated the possibility that the Church of England would become disestablished.</p> <p>For these two moments of political candour, Woolas was pulled from appearing on Question Time last night, a rare move that betrayed government alarm at a gaffe-prone minister.</p> <p>Yet those who know him say these are not gaffes. The former cabinet minister Peter Hain, who has known Woolas since university and whose campaign for the deputy leadership was run by the junior minister, said: \"He's astute, savvy, canny and completely aware of the 24-hour media cycle. The idea that he didn't mean his comments is wrong.\"</p> <p>Another Labour MP, John Mann, his best friend, best man and political ally since the first day at Manchester University, said he was \"never reckless and never thoughtless\". </p> <p>Back then, his greatest gaffe was a visual one - appearing on television as the National Union of Students president to push for an ultimately successful boycott of Barclays Bank, always wearing the same green ties. It was not until he was diagnosed as colour blind that he realised he hadn't been wearing the red ties beloved of Labour politicians.</p> <p>Mann says Woolas has always been a contrarian. \"Back in the 80s he took up causes of antisemitism like the campaign for Soviet Jewry. These were so-called fringe activities.\" </p> <p>Tim Gardam, the then editor of BBC's Newsnight, remembers Woolas from his time on the programme as \"very clever and very forthright\", and someone \"who would clearly become a politician\". Another producer remembers a swot. \"He was always sitting on the desk of the editor of the programme that day. A bit too buoyant.\"</p> <p>And then add some stunts. When Woolas went to become communication manager at the GMB union he brought a herd of pigs to London and got Nottinghamshire miners to shepherd them through the streets to decry the excesses of City financiers.</p> <p>Some of his comments may just be audible stunts: a way of getting heard. A green lobbyist who worked with him when he was climate change minister felt Woolas always had an eye on the story rather than policy - defending genetically modified food against Prince Charles and the green lobby.</p> <p>But these tactics do not seem to be accidents. The Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies, who fought Woolas in a byelection, remembers a man in control. He said: \"He was archetypal new Labour - he never expressed anything from the heart. So he has either now escaped the shackles of new Labour or is being calculating to the last punctuation mark.\"</p> <p>The calculation would be that his constituency has a high proportion of white working-class voters alienated by immigration. While ministers have started to raise this problem in the last few years, Woolas said seven years ago that Labour would lose out to the BNP unless it did more to \"create a country at ease with itself\". More recently, he has raised the possibility that the Muslim Pakistani community was fuelling birth defects by intermarrying between first cousins. </p> <p>Mann says his friend is simply more in touch with real voters than the metropolitan elite. \"He's the politician who I regard to be most in touch with British people, friend and foe alike. What he was saying was quite clear and he ought to be left to carry on saying these things. What I do know is that this debate will be continued.\"</p> <p>Hain agrees. \"There are too many politicians these days who are just technocrats rather than have political experience. But Phil is a real politician.\"</p> <p>Far from being embarrassed by Woolas, Gordon Brown is supposed to have tasked him with humanising the immigration brief. Pulling Woolas from Question Time is probably a sign of a government taking the long view - the drama of the withdrawal will be forgotten more quickly than if the straight-talking minister did some more straight talking. </p> <p>In the words of one former minister, what they don't want is for Woolas to \"say something to distract from the George Osborne story. But I bet you he'll be on Question Time in a few weeks.\"</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> December 11 1959</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> University of Manchester, BA (hons) philosophy</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married to Tracey Jane Allen, two sons</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> Positions include: National Union of Students president, 1984-86; journalist, Television South, 1987; assistant producer, BBC Newsnight, 1988-90; producer, Channel 4 News, 1990-91; head of communications, GMB, 1991-97; MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, 1997-; lord commissioner of the Treasury, 2002-03; deputy leader of the House of Commons, 2003-05; minister of state, Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs,</p>",
  "<p>Nicholas Stern (Green routes to growth, October 23) is quite correct: we should be preparing for growth with a focus on low-carbon infrastructure and investment. I am the government's design champion for the Thames Gateway Parklands and recently launched a vision for future development in the Gateway that is based on the region's most important resource: its landscape. Landscape generates value, and the return on investment in landscape and environmental regeneration is huge and makes sense during an economic downturn. Not only does it make the area a more pleasant and productive place now, but it also lays down an attractive green infrastructure which will attract further private investment over time as the economic outlook improves. Landscape and environmental investment includes developing those industries advocated elsewhere by Stern, such as responsible waste management and green energy generation.</p> <p>By investing in landscape and environmental regeneration now, the government can show its commitment to the project, improve the lives of those who do and will live there, and lay the foundations of what can become the UK's fist eco-region and a model for green regeneration elsewhere. <br><strong>Terry Farrell </strong><br>Farrells architects </p> <p>Nicholas Stern proposes a global cut in emissions of 50% by 2050, with an 80% cut in the emissions of the developed countries by then. While the principle of the contraction and convergence to world per-capita average of emissions is welcome, proposing it at a rate that is too slow is not. The coupled climate modelling in the fourth and latest IPCC assessment shows that a global cut in emissions of nearly 100% is needed by around 2060 to offset the accelerated rate at which emissions are now accumulating in the atmosphere. We need emissions contraction and convergence globally, but at roughly twice the rate he argues if we are to avoid greenhouse gas concentrations causing \"a major climate disaster\". <br><strong>Aubrey Meyer</strong><br>Global Commons Institute</p>",
  "<p>The call by MPs for a clampdown on UK companies that pay little or no tax addresses only the tip of the iceberg (MPs urge clampdown, October 22). The report from the public accounts select committee also said there was a potential \u00a38.5bn in corporate taxes that HM Revenue &amp; Customs did not collect. This figure, though, is dwarfed by the estimated \u00a3100bn that UK firms dodge in tax, often via shadowy havens, many of them British territories and dependencies.</p> <p>The people who pay the price for the missing billions are the poorest, both here and overseas. British companies are part of a global tax-dodging industry draining an estimated \u00a3250bn from developing countries. This huge sum could be invested in meeting the UN millennium development goals, which include halving poverty and hunger by 2015. However, rather than crack down on tax cheats, the government has slashed jobs at HMRC designated to investigate dodging and collect taxes.</p> <p>The government should boost resources to tackle corporate tax cheats and help to expose the billions dodged in tax havens by supporting country-by-country tax reporting standards. This would show that ministers have a serious commitment to tackling UK and global poverty.<br><strong>Simon McRae</strong><br>Senior campaigns officer, War on Want </p> <p>If buying the Titian (\u00a350m appeal, October 23) is more than the government feels it can afford, why doesn't it ask its rich friends to help pay? Rich people seem reluctant to pay their fare shares of taxes for the benefits of living in the UK and the government seems strangely frightened of asking them to help deal with, for instance, the costs and consequences of everything from bank failures to child poverty, which affect everyone. So why not give rich people a chance to redeem themselves by levying a culture tax on all high incomes?<br><strong>John Veit-Wilson</strong><br>Newcastle upon Tyne</p>",
  "<p>The signal weird moment of the last week in entertainment and politics (which are the same thing, as we shall see) was the simultaneous appearance on Saturday Night Live of Sarah Palin, the laughing stock of literate America, and Josh Brolin, whose performance in W had just opened nationwide. And this only moments after Palin and her SNL doppelganger Tina Fey had slunk past each other on stage - a double-take moment straight out of Multiplicity or Dead Ringers.</p> <p>Then there was John McCain's return voyage to the hotseat of the David Letterman show after ducking out of a previous appearance. McCain fancies himself the model for Maverick, the hotshot flyer in Top Gun, and certainly there is a similar air of homoeroticism wafting around McCain's male inner circle. On Letterman, however, he was manfully staging his own McCain Mutiny against reality itself, shifting in his seat, defending Palin, badmouthing his opponent, and doing everything short of clacking Captain Queeg's silver ball-bearings in his cupped palm.</p> <p>The election is full of these bizarre moments where showbiz trumps the news - the most brutal interrogations McCain has yet faced have been on Letterman, the housewives' coffee-klatsch show The View, and with Ellen Degeneres - and the campaign is so filled with U-turns, red herrings, cliffhangers and serial climaxes that one barely needs go near the multiplex for white-knuckle entertainment. Just keeping up with Palin's alter egos - the French populist Pierre Poujade and Australia's Pauline Hanson in politics; Tracy Flick, Marge Gunderson, Peggy Hill (and Tina Fey's spoof) in fiction - is enough to set your mind reeling.</p> <p>And movie references are ever near at hand. When the economy collapsed, I thought of Alan Pakula's 1981 financial thriller Rollover, in which the Arabs withdraw every dime from American banks; the film closes with a global montage of runs on banks, food riots and collapsing societies - par-TAY! The most harrowing predictions of the slump's possible aftermath made me rent Blindness and Children of Men, and hunger after another viewing of Mad Max II. I'm hoping the forthcoming adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's The Road will furnish me with plenty of post-apocalyptic survival tips (memo to self: pack crossbow, wolf-repellent and cyanide capsules).</p> <p>The self-immolation of the Republican party resembles nothing so much as the death throes of the Terminator in T2: Judgment Day (and that's what this is for the GOP's current incarnation). As the liquid metal monster is consumed in a vat of molten steel, all of the identities it has assumed - cop, dog, stepmom- burst one last time to the surface like a satanic greatest-hits medley, each flickering to life for a moment before issuing a savage, horrifying sound, like vomiting through a scream, before the lava sucks them under. The same is happening to the Republicans as they play the race card, the terrorist card, the elitist card and the anti-American card against their opponent. It is a magnificent process to behold, better than football, better than porn, better than T2, even.</p> <p>Oddly, we've heard little this season of that perennial electoral bete noire, Liberal Hollywood, perhaps because this year the celebrity-political imbalance is so stark. While the mass of household names long ago pledged for Obama, McCain must settle for the likes of Gary Sinise, Patricia Heaton and the increasingly intemperate far-rightie Jon Voight. The Dem-GOP Celebrity Imbalance Ratio can be expressed thus: Alec Baldwin (D); Stephen Baldwin (R). It's a rout.</p> <p>Add to that the antihagiography-cum-celluloid casket that is W., and an excellent documentary, Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story, which arrives just in time to chronicle the birth-pangs of Rovean politics (Atwater was Karl Rove's mentor) and to serve as their death-knell, and, well, you have quite the spectacle.</p> <p>No wonder people are calling this election \"a Referendum on Reality\".</p>",
  "<p>The extent of discrimination towards tens of millions of hepatitis B sufferers in China was highlighted yesterday by a plea for help from 101 mothers whose toddlers were denied nursery places after testing positive.</p> <p>The virus is endemic in China, with at least 120 million carriers - around a third of the global total, and roughly a tenth of the country's population. But the stigma surrounding it remains widespread despite recent laws banning employers from discriminating against sufferers. The government itself previously banned carriers from the civil service.</p> <p>Mother-to-child transmission is one of the most common methods of infection. But a number of provincial governments still ban carriers from nursery schools, despite the low chances of infection through casual contact.</p> <p>The mothers have written to the government pleading for help. Their letter, published in the Beijing News, said: \"Our children have already been unfortunate enough to be infected with hepatitis B, and yet [are] treated with such discrimination they cannot receive a normal preschool education.</p> <p>\"How will stigmatisation affect their character and their growing into adults?

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/12/zimbabwe3\">Morgan Tsvangirai and the MDC</a> have often been criticised for their failings in confronting Robert Mugabe and Zanu-PF's authoritarian rule. Certainly, the MDC has reproduced some of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/03/zimbabwe.southafrica\">Zanu-PF's undemocratic practices</a>. \"He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you,\" as Nietzsche wrote. </p> <p>For a long time, the MDC did not understand what sort of political animal Zanu-PF is and the lengths it would go to in order to maintain power, particularly its manipulation of Zimbabwe's history to shore up its waning legitimacy and the party's resort to political violence. As Tsvangirai once admitted to me, the MDC was \"na\u00efve\" for thinking \"Mugabe would give up power through the ballot box\" and was unaware that Mugabe would use the \"land question to delegitimise a legitimate opposition movement\".</p> <p>At its inception in 1999, the <a href=\"http://www.mdc.co.zw/\">MDC</a> was a broad political party in terms of composition. Consequently, defining itself was made all the more difficult. It had to cater to its various constituencies and some of them, white farmers especially, left it exposed to Mugabe's charge that the MDC was a \"puppet\" of white interests. The MDC's associations with the west also harmed the party's image. It did not criticise double standards over human rights in the west and the fact that Britain failed to honour its land reform commitments in Zimbabwe adequately. </p> <p>Furthermore, the MDC had exaggerated faith in the power of the international community. The international community is not a silver bullet that can open up internal space needed for democratic reform and human rights promotion. Indeed, the international community's involvement in Zimbabwe became part of the problem and not the solution. \"We were a young and emerging party. Mistakes happen,\" Tsvangirai conceded to me in 2006. </p> <p>I could go on expounding a litany of the MDC's weaknesses: the party's disunity; the use of tribal politics by some of its members; internal violence; the party's lack of depth in leadership qualities. But doing so would be overlooking a point that many commentators continue to overlook when assessing the fortunes of Tsvangirai and the MDC, which is how difficult it is to conduct opposition politics in Zimbabwe. </p> <p>Being an opposition party in Zimbabwe is one of the toughest political challenges in Africa and the evidence for this is long. In the early 1980s, under the guise of crushing dissident activity, committed by a \"poorly armed group of less than 400 at their peak who survived mainly by avoiding confrontation\", Mugabe deployed the army to Zimbabwe's Matabeleland province where it carried out systematic violence and intimidation to crush Zapu \u2013 the main political opposition at the time. An estimated 20,000 Zimbabweans lost their lives. The sheer force and calculated methodology of the violence the MDC suffered at the hands of Zanu-PF in Zimbabwe's presidential election runoff earlier this year was reminiscent of this early 1980s violence. </p> <p>To be part of the opposition in Zimbabwe is to be a \"sell-out\", \"un-African\", \"pro-colonial\" and \"illegitimate\". It is to lose one's human rights, as exemplified by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/20/zimbabwe\">Tsvangirai's failure to attend a meeting of regional leaders</a>, aimed at breaking Zimbabwe's ongoing power sharing deadlock, in Swaziland on Monday because the state would not grant him a passport, curtailing his right to freedom of movement. Tsvangirai, MDC members and supporters have, of course, witnessed worse. Torture, beatings, detention, murder and harassment are the staple diet of those associated with the opposition.</p> <p>The MDC's continued existence \u2013 given the state's attempts to destroy it since 1999 \u2013 speaks volumes of the immense courage and willpower the opposition has shown under Tsvangirai. He is a flawed leader, and so is his party, but courage and the ability to endure are two qualities Tsvangirai and the MDC can never be faulted for. Global bodies, African organisations and reform-minded African leaders owe them greater assistance in the face of Mugabe and Zanu-PF's refusal to share power.</p>",
  "<p>Reform of the global financial system. Who could disagree with that, especially in times like these? To call for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/globaleconomy-g8\">new Bretton Woods</a> conference, though, is the easy bit. It's a call that makes a politician sound statesmanlike, far-sighted, influential \u2014 even visionary. And it is not necessarily an insincere or selfishly motivated call either. In troubled times most political leaders want to do the right thing. But there is a big problem. How would it actually work?</p> <p>Before looking at Bretton Woods II, take a moment to look at Bretton Woods I. The official title of the 1944 conference was imposing \u2014 the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference. The reality was very different. Although 44 nations \u2014 including China and the Soviet Union\u2014 sent a total of 730 delegates to Bretton Woods, this was not a meeting of equals. Some attendees were governments in exile, like France. Some were not in full command of their own territory, like the Philippines. Others were present as colonial possessions, including India. Still others had no intention of subjecting themselves to anything agreed by the conference, notably the Soviet Union. All of them were at war and many of them were represented by people whose nations were going through a traumatic existential challenge. The \"never again\" mood was immense. It played a key role in getting the allies to agree.</p> <p>In practice <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system\">Bretton Woods I</a> was dominated, just as the mythology says, by two nations \u2014 Britain and the United States \u2014 and, in the end, by just one of the two, the US. The British mythology of Bretton Woods stresses the battle between a declining Britain, represented by John Maynard Keynes, which sought to create a global reserve system, and the triumphant US, represented by Harry Dexter White, which wanted a financial system based on the dollar. Inevitably the Americans won, because they were the strongest nation at the table. Bretton Woods I is often compared to a poker game. In reality though it was simply a power battle in which the most powerful country won and the others \u2014 the USSR and its supporters excepted \u2014 were compelled to accept the settlement, because they got more from being part of the US-led system than they did from refusing to be part of it. </p> <p>These principles need to be born in mind when considering any putative Bretton Woods II. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> said the other day that this was a time that called for the best ideas and the best minds. And it is tempting to imagine the great latterday economists \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/22/economy-economics\">Ha-Joon Chang</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/economics-creditcrunch\">Paul Krugman</a>, Amartya Sen, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/josephstiglitz\">Joseph Stiglitz</a> and the rest \u2014 all gathering in the New Hampshire mountains 65 years after Keynes and White to hammer out a new ideal framework of banking and credit reform for the world to follow. It would certainly be a fascinating exercise. But the reality is that the first decision about Bretton Woods II would be an entirely geopolitical one: which countries would get a seat at the table? Would it be a G7 gathering? Or a G8 (the G7 plus Russia)? Or a G20 (the G8 plus China, India, Brazil, the EU and several more). Or would it be, as Bretton Woods I was, the members of the then unofficial \"united nations\" \u2014 just 44 of them in 1944 but now an officially equal 192 (last time I looked) today? Put it another way: how can failed international institutions reform themselves?</p> <p>Merely to ask these questions \u2014 each of which would produce a very different conference and communiqu\u00e9 depending on which answer was chosen\u2014 is to realise that it may be much more difficult for the modern nations to do something in peacetime that the allied nations of the second world war were able to achieve under the pressures of potential oblivion. Not the least of the problems is that the very governments that would meet to debate the new order would themselves largely be the selfsame governments that failed to control the old one. There would, to put it mildly, be conflicting interests around the table. One thing that can also be said with absolute certainty is that Bretton Woods II would neither be dominated by the US and Britain (whatever Gordon Brown may want us to imagine) as Bretton Woods I was, nor end in a lasting settlement that centred the global economy on the United States system. Any new system would either be a tinkering with the old one (useful but nowhere approaching the structural radicalism of Bretton Woods I) or would involve radical economic changes that few of the participants, even China and Russia, seem yet to want, much less to agree on.</p> <p>None of this is to say that some sort of radical restructuring of the global banking system will not happen. But if it does, it will happen not because of economics but because of politics. It will happen because the powers simply cannot afford to allow what has happened in 2008 to happen again. Yet even if this were the case, the solution would not be as straightforward as it may seem. We are said to inhabit a post-Westphalian world in which nation states no longer command the globe as they did even in 1944. If that is the case, how can the powers, however united, determined and resolute, mould a 21st century world economy that marches to their collective drum? Looking at the agenda for any such conference it is not hard to see at least one key paradox \u2014 that Bretton Woods II would essentially mark the end of American economic dominance even while President Barack Obama (if he is elected in two weeks) might be the one political leader who might just have the authority to make some of it happen.</p>",
  "<p>The credit crunch is threatening to undermine ethical improvements made by retailers and their suppliers worldwide, according to trade unions and industry experts.</p> <p>The warning was made at today's conference in London marking 10 years of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), which brings together retailers, suppliers, trade unions, government representatives and charitable groups to promote better working practices worldwide.</p> <p>The ETI director, Dan Rees, said: \"The current economic climate threatens gains already made.\" He urged businesses to step up action against low pay and poor conditions.</p> <p>Phil Wrigley, the executive chairman of fashion retailer New Look, said: \"When people find themselves under economic pressure they tend to think about self preservation and a little less about others.

Journalists might for the moment be talking about the credit crunch and how you need to scrimp and save but we will all get used to the downturn and then they will go back to asking what we are doing with our ethical principles.\" </p> <p>Other retailers insisted there was no turning back on ethical improvements which form a central part of their business plan.</p> <p>Alan Roberts, who chairs the ETI, said retailers could not afford to step back on ethical standards as consumers' expectations had been raised and it was clearly \"bad business\" not to engage constructively with suppliers. He said the ETI would be demanding more from its members including the publication of reports on their progress towards specific goals.</p>",

  "<p>It is unusual to find someone saying anything positive on the UK housebuilders at the moment, but today came two pieces of cautiously optimistic research.</p> <p>Analysts at MF Global said it was time for investors to look for opportunities in the sector and singled out <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/persimmon\">Persimmon</a></strong> for special attention. MF said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Our top pick in the UK housebuilders which we would recommend buying on a two to three year view is Persimmon (target price 480p), as one of the highest quality stocks sector with significant upside.</p> <p>\"Until very recently, Persimmon had significantly underperformed the market, the sector, and even its most comparable US peers. We believe there is a significant amount of upside to come from the reversal of this underperformance.</p> <p>\"The group created a significant amount of value buying Westbury in 2005, but reassuringly showed restraint when Wilson Bowden and Taylor Woodrow were on offer 18 months ago.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>These two were bought by <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/barrattdevelopments\">Barratt Developments</a></strong> and Wimpey respectively.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch upgraded Persimmon from neutral to buy although it cut its target from 367p to 355p, and moved its recommendation on <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bovishomesgroup\">Bovis Homes</a></strong> from underperform to neutral. But it warned:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We would stress that we are not calling the bottom in the real world housing market, and certainly believe that there remains downside risk to short/medium term earnings forecasts. Rather, the two upgrades reflect our view that in these specific instances, our net asset value-driven price objectives point to very limited downside risk from current share price levels, and that in Persimmon's case, there is attractive upside.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It has an underperform rating on <strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong> and has cut its price target from 42p to 9p, saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We do not believe that Taylor Wimpey will see its principal lenders push for asset liquidation in the short term, and think re-financing by the group should at the least deliver our net asset value of 37p. However, the fact that debt negotiations continue to drag on suggests that a successful, conventional refinancing is by no means a foregone conclusion, and we take the view that the longer that talks continue the more likely will equity shareholders see the value of their shares slip further. We believe it highly likely that equity shareholders could emerge with little from any re-financing process and given the delay a lower likelihood of a successful re-financing.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere, it has cut Barratt Developments from 387p to 378p and warned that <strong>Redrow</strong> could be overshadowed by any plans by Toscafund to place its 27% stake in the business.</p> <p>Despite this marginally positive outlook, most of the housebuilders' shares failed to respond. Persimmon closed 5.75p lower at 236.5p, Bovis fell 2.5p to 305.75p, Taylor Wimpey dropped 2p to 10.75p, and Barratt was down 7.25p at 56.75p. The exception was Redrow, up 5.25p to 155.5p.</p> <p>Overall it was yet another volatile day, with recession worries growing as well as concerns about the global spread of the crisis, with Russia the latest country to come into the spotlight as the cost of insuring its debt in the event of default soared to record highs.</p> <p>But with Wall Street adding about 150 points by the time London closed, an early fall on the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> was reversed, and the index closed 46.94 points higher at 4087.83.</p> <p>Miners were once more among the main losers, as copper fell to a new three-year low on continuing worries about the effect of the downturn on global demand, notably China. <strong>Anglo American</strong> reported a near 13% fall in copper production in the third quarter, while <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> lost 149p to \u00a322.40 as talk that <strong>BHP Billiton</strong>, down 57p at 823p, could sweeten its hostile bid proved - so far - unfounded.</p> <p>Oil companies moved higher as the price of US crude added about $2 a barrel to $68 in advance of tomorrow's Opec meeting, where a production cut is likely to be agreed. <strong>Royal Dutch Shell B </strong>shares rose 80p to \u00a314.99 while <strong>BP</strong> was 22.25p better at 465p.</p> <p>Among the banks, <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> slipped 46p to 900p as investors fretted about its exposure to any slowdown in emerging markets.</p> <p>Consumer credit group<strong> Cattles</strong> climbed 6.75p to 41.5p as the company said its application for a banking licence was on track. James Hutson at KBW said: \"It really comes down to the banking licence now. If Cattles gets it, then it would help to draw a line under funding concerns.\"</p> <p><strong>British Airways</strong> slipped 9.5p to 138.5p after Cathay Pacific denied market talk it was interested in making a bid for the UK airline.</p>",
  "<p>So the Bank of England governor Mervyn King this week finally confirmed what the dogs in the street already knew - well those still undistracted by the city bankers begging for bonuses alongside them at least \u2013 that Britain is now in the throes of a recession. \"The plunge in orders, output and confidence is so sharp that it raises risks that the recession will be really severe,\" added one talking head from the City who has not yet taken to panhandling.</p> <p>So, every industry is suffering from falling orders, output and confidence, is it? If one was to listen to Richard Scudamore, the Premier League's chief executive and cheerleader-in-chief, or read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2008/oct/22/premierleague-creditcrunch\">David Conn's investigation of football finances</a> in yesterday's Guardian for that matter, one would believe that the only thing football is in the throes of is vim and vigour.</p> <p>But will fans take any comfort from the rude health of their football teams? Scudamore's assertion that the Premier League's 20 clubs are not being sucked into a black hole of debt is probably not far off the mark, the bulk of the massive debt is held by the big four of Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool \u2013 global brands who are unlikely to do a Bear Stearns on it. But in this time of recession \u2013 unvisited since 1992 (coincidentally the year that brought us the inaugural Premier League season) \u2013 will football offer fans the safe haven from financial realities it once did?</p> <p>I'm not of the right vintage or nationality to remember the British recession of 1983, but I'm suitably Irish to remember enough of the 80s and early 90s. Recessions are not necessarily fun, but there are fun things to do during a recession \u2013 football certainly being one. Which is why I think Margaret Thatcher's 1987 proclamation that there was no such thing as society would have come as a huge surprise to the vast numbers of men and women (but admittedly predominantly men) who filed into cage-like football grounds up and down the country during that grim decade to support their team, even though not even the most successful, in the wake of the Heysel disaster, could hope for European qualification.</p> <p>Football was something that the average fan could afford, before clubs referred to fans as consumers. Football players were still, just about, real people that your disaffected miner or unemployed steel worker could identify with. Or at least admire. Rutted pitches, rugged players, coarse managers \u2013 all brought together in the most unglamorous of arenas and all for little more than the price of a round of drinks. It wasn't showbusiness, it was everyone's pastime. Say a call centre in Islington goes belly up, how many of those laid-off could forget their worries by taking in an Arsenal game at the stunning 60,000-seat Emirates Stadium? Forget about the waiting list, the cheapest ticket will still set you back \u00a342 \u2026 a lot more than a round of drinks.</p> <p>But it's not just the cost of live football that lessens the succour it offers in these grim times; it's also the intangible, the romance, the \"jumpers for goalposts\" element of the game that no longer exists to tie it to the game played in the fields up and down the country. </p> <p>In 1983 when the crunching of employment rather than credit sucked Britain into a recession, Bob Paisley was leading his glorious Liverpool side to the last of six titles under his stewardship. Second that season were Watford, thanks to the synthesis of Elton John's modest investment, a young Graham Taylor's tactical nous and the explosive impact of two exciting young English prospects. Luther Blissett would blaze a trail for footballers following the money trail to the cash rich Serie A, returning to the bosom of English football after one memorable \u2013 if for all the wrong reasons \u2013 season at AC Milan, for exactly half the price the <em>Rossoneri</em> paid for him. John Barnes was signed from non-League Sudbury Court for the price of a new kit \u2013 he would go on to star for 1983's league runners-up, as well as playing for his country and scoring one of the most memorable goals the famous Maracana stadium in Rio ever saw. All for the price of 11 nylon Umbro efforts.</p> <p>In the same season Chelsea finished 18th in the old second division. Ken Bates had bought the club for a quid the year before, but the deal did not include Stamford Bridge, the freehold of which was owned by a firm of property developers, Marler Estates. Despite the Damocles Sword of eviction hanging over his investment, Bates allowed John Neal to build a team capable of winning the second division, which they duly did in 1983-84. The backbone of that team - Kerry Dixon, Pat Nevin, Nigel Spackman and Eddie Niedzwiecki - cost more than Barnes, but Bates still had change out of \u00a3500,000. The 1993 ERM crash brought about the collapse of Marler Estates and Bates created the Chelsea Pitch Owners (CPO) to safeguard that Stamford Bridge was never used for anything but football. The freehold is still held by the CPO, under the presidency of club captain John Terry. One would imagine that the 1984 promotion and 1993's creation of the CPO take nearly as much precedence in the hearts of Chelsea fans as Jose Mourinho's superstars league double. </p> <p>That's not to say that all was rosy with the game in the 80s and all is septic now \u2013 that would be deluded in the first and myopic in the second \u2013 but it's hard to argue that the overall aura of the game is not different. Chairmen are no longer 'Jack the Lads' in sheepskin coats driving used Bentleys \u2013 successful salesmen or warehouse owners who sought some prestige via their local football club. Men you could identify with sufficiently to shower abuse upon when they sold your greatest asset to Liverpool or Arsenal. Now clubs are owned via companies based in tax havens or are viewed as rich men's playthings.</p> <p>There is a detachment from the local community, certainly in the upper echelons of football, that may see the club play a lesser role in salving the woes of those buffeted in this new financial storm. One consumer commentator said last week that a tightening of belts could see more people shop locally, foregoing car trips to out-of-town retail parks and shopping centres. It is not only Homebase and Tesco who have relocated to the fringes of towns and cities. One would hope those shining beacons of football's modernization, the suburban all-seater stadium, will not see a significant drop in footfall like their retailing neighbours. But one would also hope football will offer some solace to its consumers, sorry, fans.</p>",
  "<p>It is fitting that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/brettonwoods\">a new Bretton Woods</a> is being discussed now. The original Bretton Woods institutions were created after the second world war in recognition of the fact that even developed countries can experience liquidity crises and that global efforts are required for economic development. In the throes of the current, formidable economic crisis, it is appropriate to consider the ways in which the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/3187467/Financial-crisis-is-man-made-catastrophe-says-World-Bank-chief.html\">international economic system can be reformed</a> to govern globalised financial markets and inter-linked economies. <br><br>Although there have been calls for some time for the current international financial institutions (IFIs) to be more representative of emerging economies, it took this financial crisis to underscore the extent to which the global economic structure has changed. Namely, the global imbalances which permitted the west to access cheap credit despite its low saving rates, particularly the US and the UK. The worst banking crisis since the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression\">Great Depression</a> strongly suggests that a global rules-based system is necessary to oversee financial markets and coordinate economic management. The issues are rather different from those of the Bretton Woods era, and would require further development of international economic institutions and laws to govern an increasingly multi-polar world economy.</p> <p>A new Bretton Woods has to be accommodative of the shifting global economic weight toward emerging economies, but also able to act quickly to stabilise financial markets. This would require promulgating international economic law and regulations as well as reforming the current international financial institutions, such as the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm\">IMF</a>. </p> <p>The financial crisis has revealed the extent of the inter-linkages among markets, making it apparent that cross-border dealings require regulation. For instance, there should be an international clearing house for financial transactions and also a body to monitor cross-border capital flows. The latter of which could be under the auspices of an institution like the <a href=\"http://www.bis.org/\">Bank for International Settlements</a> (or BIS, which is the central banks' bank) with power to demand greater transparency in financial dealings in all major markets. </p> <p>This need not be more burdensome than what national regulations already require, though clearly reform is needed there as well. The resultant multi-level system of governance could be modelled after federal regulatory systems such as in the US. However, regulation cannot be the entire answer, as active engagement by regulators will always be needed since written rules are unlikely to keep up with innovative markets. In a new Bretton Woods system, there should be regulators operating under the auspices of an international regulatory framework to monitor world markets. </p> <p>Second, banks are indeed global or at least regional, as in Europe, so there should be a coordinated and efficient deposit insurance scheme up to a widely accepted limit so that confidence is assured and bank runs are not a possibility even if there are bank failures, as is the system in the US. </p> <p>Third, the existing international institutions continue to have important roles, but need reform, including expanding their memberships to reflect the shift of global economic power to the east. Even before this crisis, there was much talk about increasing transparency and accountability in the IMF in particular. As a provider of liquidity when countries are in trouble, it is telling that <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5itQzswxi7QzOQgTSZpEYHznhE3wAD93LL6DG0\">Iceland</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/3222412/China-to-bail-out-near-bankrupt-Pakistan.html\">Pakistan</a> were reluctant to seek their assistance and turned instead to the emerging powers of Russia and China, respectively. </p> <p>Similar reforms to strengthen the mandate of the World Bank would also be warranted. Fourth, a likely response to looming national recession is an increase in protectionist sentiment, evidenced in the <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/id/17606.htm\">Smoot-Hawley Act</a> passed in the US in the great depression which had the effect of slowing global trade and worsening the economic downturn. Any new Bretton Woods system should encompass reforms to the <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/\">World Trade Organisation</a> (WTO). The WTO helps to establish a rules-based system for trade and should work to ensure that trade is not disrupted by protectionist tendencies that can arise in times of crisis. Its operation in the past decade suggests that it is a fairly efficient forum for resolving disputes, though the <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news08_e/agric_15oct08_e.htm\">Doha round</a> extending its coverage to more traded goods and services has stalled. Enhancing the WTO should be part of any new system so that rules rather than power (and politics) are the premise of international trade; in other words, the development of international economic law. </p> <p>Finally, an international body or forum cannot force its mandate on sovereign nations, but must appeal to the mutual self-interest of countries in maintaining stability by, for instance, monitoring the development of the so-called global imbalances which led to excess liquidity and mis-priced risk. The onus cannot entirely be on one country, as macroeconomic forces are intertwined, eg if the US didn't consume so much, then China would not be such a significant lender. </p> <p>A new set of Bretton Woods institutions that identified these economic flows and assessed their consequences would help policymakers coordinate responses to try and lean against future asset bubbles. Indeed, the next one could be in emerging economies as cheap currencies and trapped domestic savings fuel housing bubbles even as interest rate cuts to stimulate the west promote global liquidity searching for the next investment opportunity, which will be in Asia in the next couple of years. It is therefore in the interest of all countries to have a system of international economic law and associated institutions, and a new Bretton Woods would be a positive legacy of this financial crisis.</p>",
  "<p>He is renowned for his long hours, hectic schedule and workaholic habits but the stress of high office may be taking its toll on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran\">Iran</a>'s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and jeopardising his political future.</p> <p>Speculation about the hyperactive leader's health was prompted this week after a keynote speech to the state statistics and planning body was cancelled at the last minute and a cabinet meeting took place without him. A speech to a martyr's commemoration event was also called off. A senior aide, Amir Mansour Borghei, told journalists the president was \"indisposed\".<br>It has triggered rumours that Ahmadinejad, 52, is suffering from a long-term illness that may stop him running for re-election next year.</p> <p>Shahab, the Iranian news website, reported that this week's events were the latest in a series of cancellations and said the president had previously pulled out of engagements because of listlessness caused by low blood pressure.</p> <p>In May Ahmadinejad pulled out of events in three consecutive weeks, including a high-profile rally in Golestan province where he was due to meet voters face-to-face. Aides said he had an overcrowded schedule.</p> <p>Citing \"sources close to the government\", Shahab said doctors had advised the president to cut his workload to reduce the possibility of illness. There is little sign he has heeded any such advice: yesterday's cancellation came after Ahmadinejad had returned to Tehran from a visit to the Asalouyeh oil and gas project in southern Iran.</p> <p>The reports will be a blow to the pride of a leader who revels in his energetic style and is known for micro-managing government affairs.</p> <p>They come at a time when Ahmadinejad is wrestling with acute political problems including near 30% inflation, rising unemployment, plummeting global oil prices, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/iran-middleeast-ahmadinejad-bazaaris\">market trader strike</a> over plans to impose VAT and demands for the resignation of his interior minister, Ali Kordan, for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/13/ali.kordan.oxford\">falsely telling MPs he had an Oxford University degree</a>.</p> <p>More worrying is that the rumours appear to have given Ahmadinejad's critics a new stick to beat him with. Fellow hardliners in Iran's so-called principalist, or fundamentalist, camp are calling for the president to withdraw from the forthcoming presidential election unless doubts over his health are cleared up.</p> <p>Issa Saharkhiz, an Iranian political analyst, said the reports could have been fanned by opponents, including the Tehran mayor, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, who are preparing to run against the president. \"I'm not sure if these health problems are permanent or just a result of tiredness,\" Saharkhiz told the Guardian. \"But some groups, mainly moderate conservatives, may be thinking that they have found a political solution for eliminating him from the nomination for the elections.\"</p> <p>It is not the first time an Iranian political leader has been the subject of health speculation. Rumours have circulated for some time about the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is believed to have been treated for prostate cancer. Unfounded reports last year suggested he had died.</p>",
  "<p>It all came out at the <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/imax/FMTTM.aspx\">Science Museum</a> at around half eight this morning. The team took turns to speak, and as they did, it became clear that here is a highly motivated, not to say highly competent, bunch of engineers. </p> <p>They hope to have <a href=\"http://www.bloodhoundssc.com/\">the car</a> built by next December. That's no easy task when you're strapping a solid oxide rocket onto a Eurofighter Typhoon jet engine and encasing it all in a sleek body to keep drag to a minimum. The team will do test runs at around 800 and 900 mph before pulling out all the stops around 2011 and going for the first four figure drive on Earth.</p> <p>I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/oct/23/motoring-land-speed-record\">wrote about the car this morning and included a fun, if slightly cheesy, animation of the car in action and a gallery</a>. Rumour is another big team in the US is about to throw their hat into the ring and challenge the Bloodhound SSC team.</p> <p>Two of the team, Richard Noble and Andy Green, have worked together before of course. Noble, who broke the world land speed record himself in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust2\">Thrust 2</a> in 1983, was project director for that car's successor, <a href=\"http://www.thrustssc.com/thrustssc/contents_frames.html\">Thrust SSC</a>, which was driven by Green. In 1997, they claimed - and have so far retained - a land speed record of 763mph.</p> <p>At the launch, I was fortunate enough to spot <a href=\"http://www.thrustssc.com/thrustssc/Team/Ron_Ayers.html\">Ron Ayers</a>, a legend among aerodynamicists and the man who designed the <a href=\"http://www.wingweb.co.uk/missiles/Bristol_Bloodhound_SAM.html\">Bristol Bloodhound missile</a> that became a mainstay of UK air defences in the 1950s. In a nod to Ron, the name Bloodhound was used as a codeword for the latest car while it was being worked on in secret in Bristol.</p> <p>Ayers is in his mid-70s now, but he's still working and excited about being involved in the Bloodhound SSC project. I was asking him how engineers keep a car like this on the ground, and he mentioned that a big problem in the past has been shock waves around the back end of land speed record cars. He mentioned at least two cars that had their back ends lift off as transonic shock waves hit the back of the vehicle. With Bloodhound, they hope to go through the 150mph stretch where transonic effects are tricky to deal with, in around three seconds.</p> <p>It's gripping stuff, and hopefully just what is needed to get students interested in engineering and science. Green, as it happens, is not only a fighter pilot, but an Oxford mathematician.</p> <p>So will it do the job? Will it encourage more women into engineering? The team say inspiring people is more important to them than breaking their own record and reaching that magical 1,000mph mark. Fingers crossed they'll do both, while keeping the car and its occupant in one piece.</p>",

  "<p>Food sales have fallen for the first time in two decades after British shoppers cut back on their spending amid <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2008/aug/15/unemployment\">rising unemployment</a> and slow income growth. </p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said sales volume for food stores dropped 0.1% in the three months to September, compared with the same period a year ago. </p> <p>Until now, food sales have grown every year despite the economic situation with a 2.7% increase over the past 20 years. </p> <p>The ONS said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail\">retail sales</a> dropped 0.4% between August and September, leaving sales up 1.8% on a year earlier, the lowest increase since February 2006. </p> <p>Although the monthly fall was smaller than had been expected by City economists, they warned worse was to come. </p> <p>\"Retail sales data will have significantly further to fall,\" said James Knightley, an economist at ING Financial Markets. \"Indeed, with unemployment rising, asset values plunging and wages failing to keep pace with the cost of living, the squeeze on household budgets is likely to prompt a major contraction in consumption,\" he said. </p> <p>Today's data showed the largest contributions to the sales decline came from textile, clothing and footwear stores, where sales fell by 2.3% on the month, and household goods stores, where sales fell by 2%. </p> <p>The ONS said sales in the third quarter of the year rose just 0.1% from the second quarter. That is down from 0.5% growth in the April to June period. </p> <p>The weak numbers bring the official data into line with recent surveys by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/retail-highstreetretailers\">British Retail Consortium</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/22/manufacturing-creditcrunch\">Confederation of British Industry</a>, which have shown consumers have reined in spending as soaring living costs and worries about the credit crunch have dented confidence. </p> <p>The official retail sales figures have been surprisingly strong in the past couple of months but have now turned around. </p> <p>A new report from Verdict Research suggests spending on non-food items on the high street is set to fall in the run-up to Christmas for the first time in more than a decade. </p> <p>Verdict predicts overall retail spending is expected to rise just 2%, in the second lowest growth rate in 20 years. The growth will be driven by spending in supermarkets while spending on non-food items is set to fall 0.2%. </p> <p>\"This is going to be the toughest retailer environment ever,\" said Verdict analyst Maureen Hinton. </p> <p>Knightley said he thought weak spending would contribute to a recession which has already begun and would strengthen the case for the Bank of England to lower interest rates. </p> <p>\"We believe that this will contribute to four consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth and scope for significant further cuts in interest rates \u2013 we see the policy rate at 2.75% in the second quarter of 2009.\" </p> <p>The British Bankers' Association announced today that new mortgage approvals ticked up slightly to 23,400 from August's record low of 21,300. </p> <p>The BBA statistics director, David Dooks, said: \"It was not surprising to see continued low levels of mortgage lending and approvals in September, ahead of the government's banking support announcements.

If you work in an average office you'll be greeted by the muted cacophony of printers, computers, conversations, road noise and even music. And now you've noticed you won't be able to ignore it. Sorry about that.</p> <p>The world is a noisy place full of noisy things that impinge on our concentration. An Austrian study a few years ago found that excess ambient noise was a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/05/010523072445.htm\">major factor in stopping children learning</a>. And if it's hard to grasp long division while the school caretaker mows a lawn, it must be as hard to pay attention during a meeting while a pneumatic drill hammers away outside. </p> <p>As I write this, for example, someone is playing what sound like Central American ballads extraordinarily loudly through an open window. Others are having a shouting match on the street, a truck is reversing, someone is collecting recycling, which involves glass being dropped into a container, inevitably smashing, and some kids are making laughing/chasing noises. Were I dictator of the world I would ban motorbikes without adequate silencers. We know you invested in a Harley Davidson or similar ludicrously overpowered bike; we can see it. But we don't need to hear it for a mile in either direction, you be-leathered chump.</p> <p>The environment in which you work goes beyond how you have adjusted your chair and the height of your desk. Ergonomics is doubtless essential, but what about noise, lighting, temperature and air quality? If there is a hell it is lit with flickering fluorescent tubes, has windows that won't open and is three degrees beyond the edge of comfortable in either direction.</p> <p>We make sure our goldfish don't have a stressful environment (or at least try to - I've accidentally sent a few to sleep with the fishes), so why not extend the same courtesy to ourselves? I know that a plastic castle in the middle of the office and a regular supply of food being dropped in from above would improve my working day. </p> <p>Temperature also affects the way you feel. Too hot and you're sluggish, sweaty and will regret making tea as it's definitely a myth that it cools you down. Too cold and you're forced to wear your coat indoors and test that other myth that you won't feel the benefit when you go outside.</p> <p>I once had to work in an office without windows doing shift work at odd hours, and it made me slightly strange. I developed twitching eyes and a distinct pallor in spite of my brown-ness. I looked, after a couple of months, like a 45-year-old Second Life fanatic who lived in his grandparents' basement and ate only crisps. Since then I've always tried to make sure I sit near a window. Vitamin D is more vital than you think - sleep experts recommend getting some sunshine at lunchtime to wake you up if you're flagging.</p> <p>I'm not convinced by these ridiculous Google-esque offices either, where everyone sits on beanbags or plays pool. After about a week you'd be bored of the swings, and just imagine how humiliating it is if you've been fired to have to slide down a fireman's pole with your desk belongings and mug. </p> <p>Instead, let's go back to nature: I'd like to work by a babbling brook with a perfectly shaped log desk and chair. The animals nearby would be extras from Wind In The Willows, complete with adorable accents and natty costumes. Friendly birds might land on my shoulder to tweet gently. Although, come to think of it, chirping, mooing and whatever noise badgers make might grate after a while. So instead of this U-rated Disney vision I'll just settle for someone designing a quieter printer, the banning of YouTube videos of Kriss Kross in the workplace and the guy across the street turning off his Central American ballads.</p>",
  "<p>The extent of discrimination towards tens of millions of hepatitis B sufferers in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> was highlighted today as 101 mothers pleaded for help after their toddlers were denied nursery places for testing positive.</p> <p>The virus is endemic in China, with at least 120m carriers - around a third of the global total and roughly a tenth of the country's population. But the stigma surrounding it remains widespread despite recent laws banning employers from discriminating against sufferers. The government itself previously banned carriers from the civil service.</p> <p>Mother-to-child transmission during childbirth is one of the most common methods of infection. But a number of provincial governments still ban carriers from nursery schools, despite the low chances of infection through casual contact.</p> <p>Now the mothers have written to the government pleading for help. Their letter, published in the Beijing News today, said: \"Our children have already been unfortunate enough to be infected with hepatitis B, and yet [are] treated with such discrimination they cannot receive a normal pre-school education.</p> <p>\"How will this affect our children's lives? How will stigmatisation affect their character and their growing into adults? We dare not think.\"</p> <p>Li Hua, a mother from coastal Shandong province, told Reuters that they had written to Liu Yandong, who holds an education portofolio within the State Council, China's cabinet.</p> <p>\"We thought of writing to Premier Wen Jiabao but thought he might be too busy ... then we thought of Liu Yandong because she is the only woman on the State Council ... is possibly a mother herself, and can more deeply understand our feelings,\" she added.</p> <p>Li said a local nursery refused her three-year-old daughter, despite its director's acknowledgement that the virus had a low risk of infection.</p> <p>\"There is not enough information about this disease in the country at the moment. Many people don't understand it. So it is urgent that national policy be issued to protect our children,\" she said.</p> <p>Hepatitis B can also be passed on through sex, blood transfusions and contaminated needles. But while older children and adults can overcome acute infections, many children under five end up carrying it for life. One in four are at risk of developing cirrhosis - scarring of the liver - or liver cancer later in life.</p> <p>China has begun a mass immunisation programme for children, but so far it's scope remains far below that needed to limit its spread.</p> <p>The lack of affordable, good quality healthcare in China means that hundreds of people die as a result of hepatitis B each day.</p> <p>Advocates blame the stigma surrounding the virus on ignorance. People know less about it than HIV/Aids, despite the fact that it affects only a fraction of the number who carry hepatitis B.</p>",
  "<p>The grisly conditions facing UK retailers were underlined today when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/dsginternational\">DSG</a>, which operates Currys and PC World, revealed a big drop in sales of TVs and computers. </p> <p>The struggling group, which has been battered by rivals on the high street and online, is cutting \u00a330m off its investment plans. </p> <p>Like-for-like sales of computers and computer equipment through its PC World outlets in the UK and Ireland were down 11% over the past 24 weeks as consumers reined back their spending. </p> <p>At Currys and Currys.digital \u2013 formerly known as Dixons \u2013 the sales fall was 7%. </p> <p>In the group's European operations, sales in the previously better performing Nordic countries were down 6% and there has been a 10% dip in southern Europe, which includes DSG's disastrous UniEuro chain. The group is looking for offers for its businesses in Italy and Spain. </p> <p>\"Consumer confidence has significantly deteriorated across Europe\", said <a href=\"http://www.dsgiplc.com/\">DSG</a>. </p> <p>The chief executive, John Browett, who was hired to turn around the business a year ago, said sales of laptops had slowed and flatscreen televisions \u2013 which have been powering sales \u2013 are \"negative in value terms\". Profit margins have also deteriorated. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the former Tesco executive unveiled a \"renewal and transformation plan\" designed to revive the fortunes of the group, which is Europe's biggest electricals retailer. </p> <p>The plan focuses on heavy investment in the stores to bring them up to date, staff training to offer better service and a complete overhaul of the products on the shelves. </p> <p>Browett said today he was \"being prudent\" and \"taking decisive action\", cutting capital expenditure and lowering the stock intake, mirroring the actions being taken by many other retailers as they brace for the impact of higher unemployment. </p> <p>The DSG update came as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/23/retail-sales-recession\">official data showed sales growth has slowed sharply</a>. </p> <p>Several other retailers have also reported increasingly tough conditions this week. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/22/debenhams-retail\">Debenhams</a> said recent sales were down 4% and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/22/homeretailgroup-argos-homebase\">Home Retail Group</a>, which owns the Argos catalogue shops chain and the Homebase DIY stores, said trade was tougher than at any time since Argos was founded 35 years ago and recent sales were down 9% on last year. </p> <p>Today, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/sportsdirectinternational\">Sports Direct</a> said it was \"battling the toughest trading conditions it has ever faced\" in its 25-year history. Its shares, which floated in February 2007 at 300p, were changing hands at only 36.5p today. </p> <p>Browett said fears of a complete retail meltown could be wide of the mark: \"I've operated in a lot of recessionary environments. I've seen very bad markets before. But this is not the end of the world. I'm a bit surprised by the Armageddon-type headlines... it doesn't feel like a global slump of epic proportions. There are still people out there willing to shop.\" </p> <p>He is pressing ahead with plans to refurbish the group's stores and has completed makeovers on 40 PC World stores, seven Currys' superstores and four Currys.digital outlets. </p> <p>Last week, the group opened its first 55,000 sq ft megastore, at J9 of the M6. There was traffic chaos on the motorway as shoppers arrived in droves to buy specially-discounted goods. </p> <p>Browett refused to say how the new-look stores were performing, saying only \"so far, so good\". There has been speculation the refurbished stores are seeing sales uplifts of about 20%. </p> <p>Browett said it was \"still full steam ahead\" for his renewal plan, although DSG has pared back the cost of the revamps and he would only reconsider the updates if there was a \"major\" economic collapse. </p> <p>He played down the threat posed by US giant Best Buy, the world's biggest electricals retailer, which has linked with Carphone Warehouse to open 100 vast stores across Europe by 2013. </p> <p>The impact Best Buy might have, he said, was being exaggerated, as it will have only three or four stores in the UK by the second half of next year. \"It really isn't a big factor in our business\", he said. </p> <p>DSG shares, which have lost 80% since Browett joined the business, were up 1.75p at 25.25p, a rise of nearly 8%. </p> <p>Analyst Freddie George at Seymour Pierce still rates the shares a sell. \"Although the stock has been a significant underperformer, we continue to believe there is too much overlap between PC World and Currys; the Nordic markets are becoming more competitive, putting margins under pressure, and there is likely to be disappointment that there has not been more progress with selling UniEuro, Italy, or the Spanish operation,\" George said.</p>",
  "<p>\"Three great forces rule the world: stupidity, fear and greed\" - Albert Einstein. </p> <p>As fear takes over from greed in the financial world, markets are gyrating wildly with no apparent end in sight. Are stock traders and investors losing their nerve as the world heads into what many fear will be a deep and prolonged recession? Or are the violent movements an accurate assessment of the current plight of the global economy? </p> <p>Markets can be slow to react to information that is unexpected and unwelcome, as was the case with the numerous warning signals that pointed to the US sub-prime crisis. </p> <p>\"Most in the financial world were like deer in headlights,\" says <a href=\"http://www.aif.nl/NEW/faculty/professors/hershshefrin.htm\">Professor Hersh Shefrin</a>, who teaches behavioural finance at Santa Clara University in California and the Amsterdam Institute of Finance. </p> <p>He classifies the lack of reaction over the past three years as \"irrational behaviour\" on the part of traders. And now we are seeing an equally irrational overreaction, he believes: \"What we have now is the polar opposite, where the reaction is absolutely frantic. The underlying fundamentals on a day-to-day basis are not changing anything like what's happening in terms of the equity markets, which are bouncing around from day to day.\" </p> <p>Piling on the stress are fears over job security - tens of thousands of bankers have lost their jobs as major firms merge or, in the case of Lehman Brothers, collapse. Goldman Sachs is reportedly poised to axe one in 10 of its workforce - more than 3,000 people. </p> <p>Dr Alden Cass, a clinical psychologist who counsels Wall Street bankers and is the author of Bullish Thinking, says he has seen an increase in the number of new clients over the past month and has cut his prices to make his therapy sessions more affordable \u2013 his hourly rate now starts at $225, rather than $300. </p> <p>\"There's a sense of powerlessness. Markets are extremely volatile and irrational \u2013 all of a sudden people are dealing with a different beast,\" Cass said. </p> <p>Financial advisers don't know how to attract new business and hedge fund managers fear for their jobs. Often suffering panic attacks and muscle aches, his clients were drinking more alcohol and turning to prescription drugs \"to numb their pain\", he said. \"Even when times are good, their coping skills for stress are not very good. The consequences are often depression and divorce.\" </p> <p>Cass pointed to his study of 26 male New York stockbrokers conducted during the tech boom of 1999, which showed that 23% suffered from clinical depression, about three times the national average. They spent 12 hours-a-day at work, smoked nearly two packets of cigarettes and consumed alcohol and drugs, especially cocaine. For relaxation, they preferred solitary pursuits such as jogging, masturbation and fishing. </p> <p>Brokers who showed the greatest signs of depression, anxiety and emotional exhaustion were the most successful financially.</p> <p>Surveys show decisions made by investors and stock traders are often driven by emotion rather than rational calculation. </p> <p>The American economist <a href=\"http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/\">Robert J Shiller</a>, author of the 2000 book, Irrational Exuberance, used Julius Caesar's famous phrase: \"Men willingly believe what they wish\" to illustrate this. Like football fans, investors suffer a \"wishful thinking bias,\" Shiller said, meaning they overestimate the probability of success. </p> <p>\"It should be clear that human patterns of less-than-perfectly rational behaviour are central to financial market behaviour, even among investment professionals. At the same time, there is little outright foolishness among investors,\" wrote Shiller, professor of economics at <a href=\"http://icf.som.yale.edu/confidence.index/\">Yale University</a>. </p> <p>The phrase <a href=\"http://www.irrationalexuberance.com/definition.htm\">irrational exuberance</a> was made famous by the former US Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, during the stockmarket boom of the 1990s. But it has its counterpart - irrational pessimism. </p> <p>Major stockmarket trends often begin and end with periods of frenzied buying or selling. They are thought to reflect herding behavior that is often driven by emotion - greed in the bubbles, fear in the crashes. </p> <p>Investors join the crowd in a rush to get into or out of the market. \"It's blindingly obvious at the moment that sentiment can be a dominant factor in the markets. Herding is just one aspect of that,\" said <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wbs/subjects/finance/finance_faculty/mark_s/\">Mark Salmon</a>, professor of finance at Warwick Business School. </p> <p>\"Following the market means you don't stand out as an investment manager and you don't lose your job,\" he said. \"It also means suppressing your own private information. As people just follow each other, nothing more gets put in. Prices are driven purely by subjective forces as opposed to fundamentals.\" </p> <p>Salmon warned against the assumption that the current stockmarket swings were all down to irrationality, however. \"The risk has risen and people are reacting rationally by getting out of risky assets; that is equities,\" he said. \"A lot of perceived news is coming out and that's why there is a lot of volatility.\" </p> <p>Another reason is that professional investors with highly leveraged positions have been unloading them gradually - and hedge funds are next. </p> <p>\"Redemptions are building up in major hedge funds,\" Salmon said. \"The deleveraging process hasn't started properly,\" he said, adding that a large number of hedge funds would go bust when it did. </p> <p>Salmon's view is that \"the efficiency of the City goes together with fear and greed \u2013 but they clearly have to be contained\" through better regulation. </p> <p>Shefrin questioned whether the markets' reaction was appropriate, however. \"Markets are down about 40% from their peaks \u2013 but is activity down by 40%? Are earnings going to be down by 40%?\" </p> <p>He thinks markets have further to fall as the global recession unfolds \u2013 perhaps by two-thirds from their peak over the next 12-18 months. But, he said, this was nowhere near as bad as the 90% stockmarket slump seen during the Great Depression. </p> <p>Researchers talk of \"recency bias\" \u2013 meaning lessons from history are rarely learned because people only remember the most recent events. </p> <p>Shefrin said: \"This episode is going to be so painful that 10 years from now we won't have forgotten.\"</p>",
  "<p>The debut appearance of Dwain Chambers at the Oxford Union, legendary amphitheatre of august debate (and student whimsy) was a fascinating prospect. Chambers had already cancelled one scheduled spot here at the height of his pre-Olympic notoriety. But on Wednesday night Britain's most compelling reformed drug cheat elite athlete finally granted a private audience to the nation's gilded egg-head youth. </p> <p>In the end it was a surprisingly gripping performance, light on doggerel and cant and heavy on that surprising, goofy charm. This was the naked Dwain, the bare forked athlete: his hopes, his fears, his interminable anecdotes. And if it was also a little awkward at times, a little too close to a form of public group-therapy, then this only added to the spectacle. </p> <p>Even before he entered the Union's oak-panelled library, there was a tangible excitement about the place - and this is a venue well used to heavy hitters. Other guests this term include the Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, Chinese writer Jung Chang, Laurence Llewellyn-Bowen and Keith Chegwin. This is the society that has given a platform to both the Dalai Lama and Kermit the Frog. A blend, then, of international statesmen and muppets. Which one is Chambers? He was sharing the bill with the former chancellor of the exchequer Nigel Lawson, if that's any kind of clue.</p> <p>That excitement, then. With ten minutes still to go they were already turning hopeful punters away as a mild outbreak of Dwazzamania prevailed. Say what you like, this man puts bums on seats. Frowning sporty lads made notes. A troupe of loud, posh women colonised the front three rows. And, thrillingly, Dwain kept us waiting in our seats while he pawed at his blocks, brooding, flexing, visualising his opening joke and generally messing with our heads. </p> <p>He entered to wild applause, albeit looking a little nervous. When he spoke it was in a clear, rich voice. It's a good public speaking voice, perhaps even a little too professional and practised. He kicked off with some well worn biographical stuff, all tinged with the air of the itinerant preacher man, the redemptive confessional. This is the essential Chambers shtick now. \"My heart was always drawn to athletics,\" he says of his early years. \"That was where I learnt my lessons in life.\" But what are those lessons exactly?</p> <p>First up there are a lot of hoary tales. It's not long before we're into \"So I'm sitting there cacking myself before the race ... Maurice is pacing up and down\". The legendary American sprinter Maurice Greene crops up a lot here. He's the sprinting equivalent of \"a certain I T Botham\" in Dwain's world - the hero of all his best stories.\"</p> <p>But essentially we're here to get some feel-good stuff about lessons learnt and making the big choices. Dwain's message sounds simple, but it's still oddly paradoxical and confused. \"If I was told by an athlete who never took drugs not to take them, I wouldn't listen,\" he says, as if this were self-evident (rather than perverse). </p> <p>He regrets his mistake, but is still fascinated by its results. After stopping taking seven different substances under the guidance of Victor Conte, founder of the Balco laboratory, he felt \"like a mere mortal again\". He looks deflated just talking about it. \"When I was on [ie on drugs] I never got tired,\" he remembers, dreamily. \"I was just a machine. I could run and run.\" This kind of stuff makes your spine tingle. </p> <p>There are lyrical touches, too. \"It's like in the Matrix. Neo was left with the red pill and the green pill. I was like that too - I wanted to see how deep the rabbit hole was\". This is a new take: Dwain as psychedelic adventurer, the Timothy Leary of sprint. </p> <p>He gives us some hair-raising insights into the drug cheat industry. The notorious Balco Drug programme is compared to an F1 mechanics team in its intensity. There was mass support, control tests, guinea pig athletes. Dwain still talks almost fondly about \"Victor\". You get the feeling he liked other things about being in the Balco gang besides the drugs: perhaps even the unlikely camaraderie, the feeling of elite corps transgression. </p> <p>There are some hard edges when he talks about his British peers on the track. He's magnanimous about his former relay team-mate Darren Campbell's ongoing hostility (\"I understand his frustrations. I would feel the same\"); but less so about others (\"I'm sure we can develop in the relay - once we get Craig Pickering off the last leg!\" (greeted by unexpected whoops of laughter: Pickering dropped the baton at the Olympics). </p> <p>There's also plenty of unintentional humour. \"I have to be positive, it's in my blood,\" he says later, which could have saved us all lot of time with all that testing and B samples. We hear about a philanthropic project for his retirement: \"I want to go out there and find a white man who can run under 10 seconds,\" he announces, conjuring an image of something involving binoculars and a butterfly net. </p> <p>There's pathos too. We hear about the times he was \"on the floor cramping for over an hour\" at the Commonwealth Games; and the fact that members of his family no longer speak to him. While he was on drugs Chambers eventually stopped running the 200m purely (he says) out of loyalty to British team-mate Christian Malcolm, a good friend: \"I kept destroying him. It was eating me up.\" Of his Olympic exclusion he says simply: \"I wasn't going and that killed me. I still haven't had the chance to cry.\"</p> <p>There are casual revelations. On the botched and comical rugby league try-out at Castleford Tigers: \"really and truly, it was only a PR stunt.\" Although, oddly now he says the high he got from the league fitness regime was the closest natural thing he's ever found to drugs. His training is now \"rugby-based, and hopefully it's going to pay off in my progress next year\". </p> <p>Fascinatingly, he remains convinced he would have won a medal in Beijing. \"I sincerely believe that,\" he says without hesitation. \"Purely because I've had to deal with more pressure than anyone there. I believe I would have done it.\"</p> <p>Still, as he exits to loud applause you can't help feeling a little sad about the terrible waste of talent in all this: Britain's fastest 100m man reduced to the travelling circus of the novelty speaker. You have to remind yourself that Chambers will actually run again. Never mind the seminars and the hug-ins, the most significant thing to have happened to him of late is the public olive branch extended by UK Athletics chief executive Niels De Vos, who last month announced that \"if [Chambers] qualifies and meets the selection criteria he will be available the same as any other athlete\". </p> <p>Chambers is effectively back in the fold now. So what is he doing here? The righteous, prosthletysing tone is the ostensible justification for this kind of jaunt. And the chance to spread that message seems genuinely to excite him. </p> <p>Then there are the peculiar side effects of the drug ban and its attendant publicity. This seems to have created another Dwain Chambers, the public inspirationalist, the autodidact celebrity. At times you feel Chambers is as fascinated by that side of himself as he once was - and apparently still is - by his physical capabilities. </p> <p>Plus, of course, he still owes \u00a3130,000 in falsely awarded race fees. Hence the imminent autobiography, plus the mouthwatering revelation here that \"I've got my eye on boxing next\". As he says, \"I have no sponsors, ultimately you look at where I am now, it wasn't worth it\". </p> <p>It's a slightly deflating note to end on, but a reminder after all the giggles of why we're there in the Oxford Union. Those cramps. The lonely hotel rooms. The freezer full of junk. The shame. The disgust. Dwain, you feel - and perhaps even to his credit - still has a way to go with this.</p>",

  "<p>Believe it or not, behind the robo-calls and attacks and pre-convention shopping sprees to Saks for the Palinatrix, a serious debate is actually taking place in this presidential campaign. As serious as they come, in fact.</p> <p>We are now talking, more openly than we have in years in the United States, about taxation and the concept of the good society. About the extent to which we're each on our own pursuing self-interest versus the extent to which we constitute a community of shared interests. The fact that we're talking about it is remarkable enough. More remarkable still is that, for the first time in 30 years, the Democrat appears to be poised to win the argument.</p> <p>There was a time in this country when people mostly accepted taxes. They accepted that taxes were the price we pay for having a good society. Through the middle of the 20th century, marginal tax rates were very high \u2013 upwards of 70% on the highest earners. </p> <p>At the same time of course the American steel and auto and other heavy industries were veritable colossi, facing little global competition. The middle class grew, wages grew, unions prospered, people bought televisions and installed central air conditioning. People complained about taxes, as they have since Rome, but there was no such thing as broad anti-tax sentiment.</p> <p>Then came the 1970s. The 1973 Opec crisis showed an America vulnerable to foreign market manipulation. Industry began its decline. Inflation hit. Throw in crime and welfare and all the rest \u2013 Watergate, Vietnam, the loss of confidence in political leadership and public institutions. </p> <p>A situation that had been stable for most Americans for two generations was now unstable, and once-reliable economic expansion was no longer the case \u2013 1973 was the first year that inflation-adjusted wages did not increase.</p> <p>In this context, the tax revolt was born. The great testing ground was California, where a major property-tax revolt resulted in the passage in 1978 of a ballot initiative (Proposition 13) that muddles California property-tax rates to this day. </p> <p>Two years later came Ronald Reagan. Tax cuts were quickly passed. The top marginal rate today (35%) is slightly less than half what it was in 1979. Ever since, \"I'll cut your taxes and the Democrats will raise them\" has worked pretty well for Republicans.</p> <p>Now, it is true today that Barack Obama is promising a tax cut to 95% of earners. We haven't yet reached the point where a Democrat can tell a $40,000 a year\u2026oh, plumber, to pick an occupation out of the air, that his taxes will go up. (We may never get to that point, and it could well be argued that that's not such a bad thing.) But we do at least have the Democrat saying, as he famously said to Joe the Plumber, that wealth should be spread around.</p> <p>McCain's rhetoric on the trail now, in these closing days, is built around attacking Obama for saying this. The Republican nominee commences today on a \"Joe the Plumber tour\" (I'm not kidding) in which the main point is to argue that Obama, his actual tax proposal notwithstanding, will raise middle-class taxes and to paint Obama as one believes in confiscatory taxation as a matter of principle (there's an ugly and quasi-racist section of the speech about how Obama wants to give this tax money to welfare recipients, but that's not the main thrust; just, if you will, a disgrace note). </p> <p>There's a good reason this is McCain's main closing argument \u2013 it's worked quite well in most of our recent elections. But this time, maybe not. Reading around this morning, I was struck by <a href=\"http://news.bostonherald.com/news/opinion/op_ed/view/2008_10_22_We_can_t_afford_McCain_s_tax_cuts/srvc=home&amp;position=recent\">an op-ed in the Boston Herald</a>, by Edward Moskovitch, who heads an economics and public-policy consulting firm in Massachusetts. Noting that the state's governor, Deval Patrick, had recently announced $800m in budget cuts, and arguing for federal outlays to the states in the form of economic stimulus money that states could invest in services and infrastructure, he put the matter thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>In a recent talk, former Gov. Mike Dukakis observed that most people used their federal tax rebates last spring mainly to pay down credit card debt. Much of what they did buy was probably made in Asia, he added. So the rebate had little impact on the U.S. economy.</p> <p>Hard-pressed states, on the other hand, would spend their share of a fiscal relief package right here at home and, as Dukakis points out, we'd have something tangible like better bridges to show for it.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is pretty close to being a classic individual-versus-community argument. In the pages of Rupert Murdoch's right-wing tabloid.</p> <p>If Obama wins, it will be for many reasons, superficial and profound ones alike. It would be too much to say that the American public embraced a redistributionist philosophy \u2013 Obama is not making that argument head-on, as well he should not. </p> <p>But in these economic times, it does seem to be fair to say that more Americans are finally connecting the dots between investment and prosperity, and between their own economic fate and the country's at large. So, if Obama does win, it would not be too much to say the opposite \u2013 that a majority of voters rejected a Republican argument that has been the core GOP message since Reagan.</p> <p>Back in early 2007, in the pages of the Washington Monthly, Mark Schmitt suggested in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0701.schmitt.html\">a prescient, must-read piece</a> that perhaps the great tax revolt was over. In 12 days, we'll have an answer.</p>",
  "<p>The mood is not improving, with the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> now down 86.77 points at 3954.12 and US futures turning negative after early gains.</p> <p>It is, of coure, the R word that is causing the problem. Tomorrow sees UK GDP figures which are expected to show the economy shrank between June and September, after recording flat growth the previous quarter. If the latter number is revised downwards, the recession Mervyn King and Gordon Brown are talking about will be here.</p> <p>The slow pace of the decline in libor - the rate at which banks lend to each other - is not helping sentiment. Indeed, overnight dollar rates edged up 1.11% to 1.2% today, despite all the liquidity being pumped into the system by central bankers in an attempt to free up the money markets. Euro and sterling overnight rates, and three month rates for all three currencies, have continued to dip, however.</p> <p>There are also concerns about the financial crisis spreading further, with Pakistan and Russia the latest to cause concern.</p> <p>Joshua Raymond, market strategist at spread betters City Index said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The markets quickly turned negative this morning following earlier small gains. We have seen further selling of commodity and oil sectors as concerns worsen over the potential effects a global recession could have on demand for metals. After three days trading we are now off over 8% and there is nothing out there currently that could spark a significant reversal from this trend.</p> <p>\"In the long term we are now seeing what has been nervously predicted; that this reporting season will begin to unravel the impact of the wider economic downturn on all sectors and not just financial services.</p> <p>\"The fear is that not enough is being done to strategically curb the impending UK recession. Across the Atlantic it is a different picture with Federal committees meeting constantly and the US government proactively looking at ways to [help] the housing market.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Among the miners, <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> is down 294p at \u00a320.96. Earlier hopes that <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> would sweeten its hostile $63bn bid have evaporated, with Rio dismissing talk it was warming to the offer. And after yesterday's talk that the European Commission might soon approve the deal came suggestions of completely the opposite: that the EC had monopoly concerns. Meanwhile BHP, down 90p at 790p, said it hoped the regulatory review process would be completed by early 2009.</p> <p>Elsewhere, property website <strong>Rightmove</strong> has lost 18p to 201.25p after saying it was cutting 20% of its 305 staff to save money.</p> <p>In a sell note Citigroup cut its price target from 260p to 205p, saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Despite Rightmove's strong market position, the weak property market provides downside risk and little visibility to earnings going forward. Due to the lagged impact of any eventual price increases, we expect ecovery to be late cycle, hence see little reason to own the shares currently.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br> But consumer finance group <strong>Cattles</strong> has climbed 5.25p to 40p after confirming comments <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2008/oct/20/usinterestrates-oil\">here </a> earlier this week that its banking licence application - key to its future funding - was on track.</p> <p>Among the major US companies due to report later is <strong>Microsoft</strong>, which will be keenly watched for comments as to how the downturn is affecting technology spending. Analysts have suggested the company could cut its forecasts for the rest of the year, despite an expected rise in first quarter profits helped by sales of low cost laptops.</p>",
  "<p>In his third Test, his bowling set up a winning position for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/indiacricketteam\">India</a> at a venue where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/westindiescricketteam\">West Indies</a> had lost only twice in six decades. These were the 1990s though, and India simply didn't win overseas Tests, even if they had only 120 to chase. Because of that calamitous collapse to 81 all out, few remember <a href=\"http://www.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/63747.html\">Abey Kuruvilla's finest hour</a>.</p> <p>Until the still-growing Ishant Sharma came along, the 6'6\" Kuruvilla, born in Kerala but raised in Mumbai, had been the tallest quick bowler to play for India. He won all of his 10 caps in 1997, either side of his 29th birthday, and then faded from the scene. Ignored when in his prime in the early 1990s, he was merely another example of the stepmotherly treatment given to those that bowled with the new ball.</p> <p>Kuruvilla was a fringe player at best. Javagal Srinath, who finished with more Test wickets than Darren Gough and Andy Caddick, certainly wasn't. In the first half of the '90s when he was at his quickest, Srinath nudged the speed gun as far as Allan Donald did. But while the South Africans built a superb team around the pace of the White Lightning, Srinath continued to be an afterthought in the Indian scheme of things.</p> <p>That strategy revolved around spin-friendly surfaces at home and as many as three spinners in every game. It paid rich dividends at home \u2013 England were thrashed 3-0 in 1993 \u2013 but also contributed greatly to the team's haplessness overseas. Between his debut at the Gabba in November 1991 and a match-winning 6 for 21 against South Africa at Ahmedabad five years later, Srinath played just 20 Tests for India. It's worth noting that Anil Kumble aside, none of the spinners that were part of the decade-long home dominance took even 100 wickets.</p> <p>It just makes you wonder how much Srinath might have achieved if his career hadn't been such a stop-start one, if he'd played more than 67 Tests in 11 seasons. How might he have done with a John Wright or Gary Kirsten as coach, and in an environment where pace bowlers are cherished, rather than viewed as clods to take the shine off the new ball?</p> <p>In a sense, Ishant, Zaheer Khan, Rudra Pratap Singh and Sreesanth are reaping the benefits of the thankless work that Srinath, Kuruvilla and Venkatesh Prasad, the present bowling coach, did. In England in 1996, and again in South Africa a few months later, Srinath and Prasad matched those that took the new ball for the opposition, and reminded everyone that there was more to Indian cricket than wristy batsmen and legendary spin quartets.</p> <p>It's worth remembering that the first two Indian bowlers to make a mark in the international arena were Mohammad Nissar and Amar Singh, neither known for the googly or loopy off break. Nissar, a giant of a man from the Punjab, took 5 for 93 in India's opening Test at Lord's and four years later, Amar Singh had 6 for 35 at the same venue. Wally Hammond, who knew a little bit about the art of batting, was to say that Singh was \"as dangerous an opening bowler as I have ever seen, coming off the pitch like the crack of doom\".</p> <p>In the years that followed though, there was only gloom for Indian pace. Pitches that had as much bounce as a mattress and a mindset that refused to think along the lines of a balanced bowling attack meant that India became the land where opening batsmen took the new ball. Just across the border, things were very different, with Fazal Mahmood, Khan Mohammad, Sarfraz Nawaz and Imran Khan establishing a tradition that has been carried on by the likes of Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Shoaib Akhtar.</p> <p>When Indian pace did eventually revive, it was because of two men. First, Kapil Dev came along and exploded the myth that you had to be a county trundler to bowl beautiful outswing. Then, in the late 1980s, Ravi Mammen of the Madras Rubber Factory set up the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai. Dennis Lillee was the guru, and TA Sekar, who played two Tests in Pakistan in 1983, the man on the ground overseeing the day-to-day operations.</p> <p>Srinath, Prasad and a subsequent generation of aspiring pace bowlers, all spent time at the Foundation housed on the grounds of a school in Chennai. And despite the barbs directed its way down the years, it continued to work with the finest talent at India's disposal, while also opening its doors to overseas talent that wished to become more au fait with Indian conditions.</p> <p>The seeds planted two decades ago have borne fruit in the new millennium. Indian victories at the WACA, the Adelaide Oval, Trent Bridge and the Wanderers were all inspired by the pace attack. When Mickey Arthur asked for pace and bounce at the Bullring in December 2006, it was South Africa that were routed for 84, with Sreesanth producing as fine an exhibition of quick outswing as you'll ever see.</p> <p>In Perth earlier this year, Ishant had Ricky Ponting fumbling like a teenager on a first date. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/20/india-australia-cricket-second-test\">At Mohali last week, he was just as lethal</a> and Ponting said of his second-innings dismissal: \"That ball would have got me out 95 times out of 100\". A few minutes after Ponting's off stump had been uprooted, Ishant produced more prodigious movement in to see off Shane Watson. I was watching from the ABC commentary box at the time and Glenn Mitchell just shook his head. \"Best fast bowler in the world right now,\" he said. There was no qualifying it with the word 'young'.</p> <p>Zaheer, another MRF product, is bowling better than ever, as dangerous with reverse-swing as Wasim once was, while RP Singh, on the Honours Board at Lord's, and Sreesanth wait patiently in line behind Munaf Patel, who sent England tumbling to defeat on debut. Then there's Irfan Pathan, with a Test hat-trick to his name, and a flotilla of young hopefuls like Sudeep Tyagi, Pradeep Sangwan and Manpreet Gony.</p> <p>Amit Mishra has already shown that rumours of Indian spin's demise are greatly exaggerated and with Ishant of the Medusa hair leading the way, the land of the record-breaking batsmen could soon have a bowling arsenal that's the envy of the world.</p>",

  "<h2>Tarlok Teji, head of retail at Deloitte</h2> <p>\"It is not surprising to see retail sales growth slowing. The continuing diet of negative economic news is filtering down to consumers and this uncertainty is leading them to put new purchases on hold. Consumers are responding to the downturn by repairing existing products or using them for longer than they previously might have done. <br> \"However, I think we are seeing the deferment of spending and the extension of product life cycles rather than a complete stop. Christmas is around the corner and come December we may see a rise in sales volumes for sectors such as clothing as practical gifts become more of a priority this year.\"</p> <h2>Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics</h2> <p>\"With even the resilient official measure of retail sales dropping in September, the consumer spending slowdown is clearly gathering pace. With house prices still falling, credit conditions tight and unemployment starting to soar, we think that consumer spending will fall sharply next year, by around 1.5%.<br> \"At least the figures are now moving in the same direction as the gloomy survey and anecdotal evidence. The BRC and CBI surveys have both slowed sharply this year. And just this morning, DSG (owner of PC World and Currys) reported a 7% drop in like-for-like sales in the 24 weeks to 18th October and said that trading conditions remain tough.\" </p> <h2>Amit Kara at UBS</h2> <p>\"Official retail sales data has not only been volatile in recent months but it has also painted a picture of a fairly resilient consumer. The underling 3m/3m growth that is generally able to abstract from the monthly volatility is almost as volatile with the latest reading of 0.1% coming after a -0.9% print. </p> <p>\"The key point though is that the official numbers are not consistent with other surveys including those from the BRC, CBI and the Bank of England, all of which suggest that spending is shrinking at a more rapid speed. Regardless of which one of these is correct, fundamentals suggest that spending will shrink further in the coming months. Household saving ratio is close to 50-year lows, unemployment is on the rise, wealth effects are a drag and credit conditions are a lot tougher. Lower food and energy costs will help, but these are unlikely to offset the negative influences listed above.\" </p> <h2>Stephen Robertson, director general of the British Retail Consortium</h2> <p>\"With a number of major retailers reporting serious sales falls, the ONS' claim that sales values are up 3% on a year ago seems high. Our figure is just 1%. Both results are well below inflation, meaning real-terms sales falls.<br> \"The official figures rightly confirm overall sales growth is slowing and conditions toughening for customers and retailers as the crucial run-up to Christmas begins. </p> <p>\"With almost all sales growth confined to food, many non-food retailers are under huge pressure. Not only are sales hard to come by but deep and widespread discounting is putting margins under tremendous pressure as costs rise. Even food sales growth is slowing as the rate of food price rises comes down. The ONS' claim that small retailers are doing dramatically better than larger ones is hard to believe.\" <br> </p> <h2>James Knightley, ING</h2> <p>\"UK retail sales for September fell 0.4% month on month, not as bad as the consensus had feared (-0.9%) although the growth rate in August was revised slightly lower. This takes the year-on-year growth rate down to 1.8%, which is the slowest rate of growth since February 2006. Clothing and household goods both saw 2%+ month-on-month declines while non-store/repair (largely internet sales) saw a gain of 1.7% month on month,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Retail sales data will have significantly further to fall with Confederation of British Industry and British Retail Consortium data pointing to outright contraction in the year-on-year rate in coming months. Indeed, with unemployment rising, asset values plunging and wages failing to keep pace with the cost of living, the squeeze on household budgets is likely to prompt a major contraction in consumption. We believe that this will contribute to four consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth and scope for significant further cuts in interest rates \u2013 we see the policy rate at 2.75% in 2Q09.\"</p> <h2>Howard Archer, Global Insight</h2> <p>\"The correction in retail sales in September was less than expected following August's sharp gains and the suspicion remains that the official figures are overstating the strength of sales. Certainly, survey evidence from the CBI and British Retail Consortium, as well as the overall bearish reports from individual retailers, point to greater weakness,\" Archer said. </p> <p> \"The prospects for consumer spending look bleak as the financial crisis adds to the intense pressures already facing households. This is particularly worrying for retailers as the vital Christmas period looms. Consumers are being hit very hard by a punitive set of factors, which have been magnified by the financial crisis. <br> \"Going forward, we expect to see a deepening of the current growing trend of consumers looking to economize by making greater use of discount retailers and supermarkets, as well as by trading down their purchases e.g. through buying more own label brands of goods and food rather than more expensive branded products. We also expect consumers to try to increasingly look to take advantage of sales periods when buying big-ticket items.\" </p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/alqaida\">Al-Qaida</a>'s had its chips. In Iraq, Sunni Muslims, the very people the group says it fights for, kicked its fighters out of their neighbourhoods. And here, in Britain, al-Qaida has notched up an impressive list of failures. The only place Osama Bin Laden's fighters have a serious presence is Pakistan's tribal areas and Afghanistan. But even there, locals unhappy about the presence of foreign troops do most of the fighting.</p> <p>If we believe this, a good chunk of taxpayers' money has been well spent. In August, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/alqaida.uksecurity\">the Guardian reported</a> a counter-terrorism unit set up by the government had been trying to persuade media organisations to tell everyone that al-Qaida was losing support. </p> <p>Now that we know the government was trying to sell us a line, you have to wonder whether recent reporting on the demise of al-Qaida's brand of extremism succumbed to the persuasive power of spin doctoring. Is it really safe to turn our concern towards the credit crunch?</p> <p>There is now a general feeling among analysts and journalists that al-Qaida has come under pressure from former jihadists and respected Islamic theologians who condemn suicide bombings and the killing of civilians. But the basis of this conclusion is faulty for a number of reasons. </p> <p>Much of the comment on the Islamic ideological backlash against al-Qaida is based upon a treatise written by Sayyid Imam al-Sharif aka Dr Fadl from his prison cell in Egypt. Sharif's work has been hailed as devastating to extremist thinking because he was once the head of an Egyptian terrorist organisation that later joined with al-Qaida. He also wrote a book called the \"jihadist Bible\". (Shouldn't that be \"jihadist Quran?\") However, as his former deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri pointed out in an internet posting: is the power cord of Sherif's computer the same one they use for the torture equipment? Which is about the level of credence and time any serious radical I've spoken to gives it. </p> <p>I spent months with a group of radical (but not violent) young British Muslims earlier this year, at about the same time word first started leaking about Sharif's \"new\" views. The reaction in the study circles of Walthamstow and Luton was: \"And what?\"</p> <p>Not only was the credibility of Sharif's position tainted by the fact he was publishing it from prison, but with a little extra digging it doesn't even seem as if his views were all that new in any case. </p> <p>The pan-Arabic daily newspaper al-Hayat quoted Sharif's son in a 2004 article saying his father had fallen out with Zawahiri over the use of violence as early as 1992. Other sources say Sharif has already printed the views he repeats from the Egyptian prison in a book he had published in London in the early 1990s. The seriously ideologically inspired violent extremists that the analysts thought would be swayed by Sharif's arguments already know this. </p> <p>Also, pinning so much hope on theology to take the wind out of al-Qaida's sails ignores the situation on the ground. Al-Qaida's audience has changed, and is continuing to change. </p> <p>In the 1990s, when I was a teenager, you could get yourself to a training camp in Afghanistan from my local mosque. A good couple of my friends thought it would be a great laugh to run around doing target practice but that they'd have to figure out a way of avoiding the religion stuff. The only people into the \"religion stuff\" were seriously dull, as far as we were concerned. The people who could get you into Afghanistan were accessible, but only the most ideologically zealous, or dense, would want to go.</p> <p>Today, the facilitators are not accessible, but the idea has a whole new cachet of cool. Al-Qaida's image has gained credibility on the country's inner-city streets that wasn't there before 2001. </p> <p>While researching a <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/dispatches/from+jail+to+jihad/2288772\">Dispatches documentary</a> earlier this year, I met vigilantes who had adopted al-Qaida's twisted version of Islam and twisted it even further to justify violent robbery. They raided drug dealers and off licences while going to war with other gangs because, as they said, \"we enjoin the good and forbid the evil\". When I asked them how they saw al-Qaida, the responses were: \"tough, disciplined, principled\" and, my favourite description, \"shadow warriors\". </p> <p>These young men, several of whom had converted to Islam, didn't care about the ideology of faraway sheikhs. The violence was the attraction.</p> <p>If the question is: \"Yes, but are narcissistic criminals actually going to join al-Qaida's global jihad?\" The answer is, it's already happened. For the documentary, I interviewed one young man who had gone from a life of crime and gangs to a training camp in this country. Also, increasing numbers of those arrested in recent terror cases have histories of drug abuse and criminality.</p> <p>Something similar is happening abroad too. In Ain Al Helwe, a Palestinian camp in Lebanon, I saw young al-Qaida fighters returning from Iraq brimming with confidence after taking on American troops. It wasn't difficult to see the fear and awe they aroused among the middle-aged men with decrepit AK47s and tatty uniforms who represented defunct secular Palestinian organisations. </p> <p>Challenging ideology does help. I have met people who have become convinced that violence is not the Islamic way to direct their anger. But there's a growing pool of people who don't care about the intricacies of Islamic ideology. They want to fight because violence for a cause enriches their sense of self. </p> <p>Solving tomorrow's extremism problem, instead of yesterday's, requires dealing with more fundamental issues than playing with perceptions of religion. The longer the delay, the more extremism is going to spread into criminality, gun crime and gang culture. As that process continues, the treatment will become more costly. But as we've learnt from the government's treatment for the credit crunch, you get what you pay for.</p>",
  "<p>The number of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages\">mortgages</a> approved for house purchases rose slightly during September but was still 57% lower than a year ago, the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said today.</p> <p>Seasonally adjusted figures show 23,422 loans were approved for purchases during the month, compared with 53,694 in the same period last year.</p> <p>The slump in approvals underlines the continued weakness in the housing market. In recent months some surveys have recorded double-digit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">house price</a> falls while estate agents have reported a dearth of would-be buyers. </p> <p>The 10% increase between August and September only brings the figure back from a record low of 21,342. The number of loans approved for remortgage customers also rose slightly from 47,260 in August to 51,523 last month.</p> <p>Net mortgage lending, which strips out redemptions and repayments, rose to \u00a33.6bn in September from just \u00a32.1bn in August, the lowest figure since February 2001.</p> <p>However, it was still below the previous six-month average of \u00a34.1bn and well down on last September's figure of \u00a36.4bn.</p> <p>The BBA said it was no surprise that lending levels remained low in September, despite the government's moves to kick-start the housing market by raising the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/stampduty\">stamp duty</a> threshold to \u00a3175,000. </p> <p>David Dooks, the BBA's statistics director, said: \"Compared to a year ago, the mortgage environment has changed significantly, with supply restricted as a consequence of the situation in financial markets and demand at a much reduced level.\"</p> <p>He added: \"In a mortgage market that is becoming more concentrated, the high-street banks now provide more than two-thirds of all new lending.\"</p> <h2>Borrowing breakdown</h2> <p>The figures cover the month before the government made moves to shore up the British financial system by cutting interest rates and part-nationalising some of the country's biggest banks.</p> <p>Although existing borrowers on tracker mortgages will soon feel the benefit of the rate cut, as lenders pass it on in next month's payments, new borrowers are continuing to be squeezed.</p> <p>In the past two weeks lenders have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/21/mortgages-property\">increased margins on tracker deals</a> and have continued to cut down on maximum loan sizes. </p> <p>Some lenders have pulled deals and not replaced them as the wait for interbank borrowing rates to fall.</p> <p>The recent house price falls and lenders' reluctance to offer high loan-to-value mortgages is reflected in a sharp drop in the average mortgage approved for house purchases shown by the BBA's figures. Since reaching a peak of \u00a3159,600 in June last year it has fallen by more than \u00a330,000 to \u00a3128,300. </p> <p>The BBA's figures also showed consumers' appetite for unsecured <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/debt\">debt</a> remained subdued in September, as did deposits into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/savings\">savings</a> accounts.</p> <p>New borrowing on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/creditcards\">credit cards</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/loans\">loans</a> and overdrafts increased by just \u00a30.1bn over the month - half of the average of the previous six months. </p> <p>Borrowers also continued to repay more than they spent, despite a slight increase in the number of purchases made on credit cards.<br> Consumer savings rose to \u00a31.13bn in September, after a slump to \u00a3142m in August. However the amount deposited remained below the recent six-month average.</p>",

  "<p>It is called the last bastion of prejudice. Nowadays everyone seems to claim the right not only to poke fun but also to pour scorn on fatness \u2013 even when this means pointing a pudgy finger at the majority of the adult population.</p> <p>The routine stigmatising of obesity is on the increase, perhaps exemplified by the comical Ricky Gervais, who received a lot of attention when \u2013 far from joking \u2013 he suggested people should <a href=\" http://latestnews.virginmedia.com/news/entertainment/2008/09/17/rickys_fatty_plea\">shout \"fatty\"</a> at him in the street to make him feel ashamed of his weight. The enthusiasm of the media to give vent to this <a href=\"http://www.rickygervais.com/thissideofthetruth.php\">self-deprecating put-down</a> reflects an unusual <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/poll/2008/aug/05/health.children\">appetite for animosity</a> towards obesity.</p> <p>The blame culture that characterises the obese as \"greedy fat people\" \u2013 entirely at fault for their own plight \u2013 is based on a startling ignorance. Evidence has been amassing over more than a decade of the role of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/16/AR2008101602109.html\">key genes linked to obesity</a>. Gervais can't be sure he isn't among the one in six of us with a double dose of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6547891.stm\">FTO gene</a> carrying a 70% higher risk of beefing up the BMI.</p> <p>In trying to unravel the mystery of why some of us and not others are more likely to become fat, the finger also points towards <a href=\"http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/obe.2008.0166\">epigenetic influences</a>, which affect the way in which genes are switched or expressed. This effect can be passed on across generations, even though the genes themselves are unchanged. In theory the tendency to store fat \u2013 understood in any case as an evolutionary imperative \u2013 may be a legacy of epigenetics, with the survival mechanism to combat famine embedded in our genetic memory.</p> <p>There are other factors such as the hazards of being a low birth-weight baby or a large baby \u2013 both risks for a future of being subjected to bad jokes and outright prejudice. More recently scientists have been pointing to the impact of the <a href=\"http://www.theecologist.org/pages/archive_detail.asp?content_id=646\">cocktail of chemicals</a> to which all of us have been exposed to different degrees throughout the second half of the 20th century. DDT, PCBs, dioxins are a few of the more familiar ingredients in the alphabet soup of <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080514091427.htm\">endocrine-disrupting toxins</a> that have been abundant in the environment and whose residues are still affecting wildlife in even the remotest parts of the world. Our plastic-lined world may well be contributing imperceptibly to making us all fatter.</p> <p>So the eagerness of some people to line up and shout \"fatty\" is ironic when there are a multiplicity of factors at work and the majority of us are not just overweight, but advancing rapidly to join the one in four adults who are already technically obese in the UK. Who speaks for them? Who can challenge the more insidious prejudice that denies the obese access to treatment?</p> <p>Ironically many are working in the media, whose expense account meals and \"lifestyle choices\" have set them on the slippery slope towards obesity. Perhaps this last bastion of prejudice is tolerated because all of us feel guilty when we see the scales rising and our belts loosened by another notch or two. There but for fortune\u2026</p>",
  "<p>The pound has hit a five-year low. Gordon Brown has admitted for the first time that the world is heading towards recession. Almost 20,000 people have lost their homes in the first half of this year. These are bleak times we are living in my friends, but luckily for the Mill there are a few things exempt from the current global financial meltdown; namely strikers who have managed to score a few goals in the first few games of the season, strikers who managed to score some goals last season, the ability of the words \"David Beckham\" to sell newspapers and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/uselections2008-sarahpalin\">designer hockey-mom suits for Vice Presidential candidates</a>.</p> <p>First up, strikers who have scored some goals this season. In particular, Mill regular <strong>Amr Zaki</strong>, scorer of 84 goals in his first 7 games for Wigan. It seems, like many people, <strong>Steve Bruce has been losing sleep after opting for an ill-advised loan</strong> and has only just realised his mistake. After not paying up front for Zaki in summer the worry for the Wigan manager is that he will be outbid for his \"Egyptian goal-machine\" during the transfer window. However, worry not Latics, Bruce has a plan; he has <strong>issued a hands off warning (that'll do the trick) and is attempting to push a permanent deal through as soon as humanly possible</strong>.</p> <p>Another striker has been ripping it up of late is of course Peterborough's Craig Mackail-Smith. The 'it' he has been ripping up is admittedly League One, but that won't stop Tony Mowbray parting with <strong>\u00a32m to bring him to West Brom</strong> if he gets his way.</p> <p>Moving onto strikers that were good last season, <strong>Paul Ince is so sure that Roque Santa Cruz is staying at Blackburn</strong> that he has taken time out to mock Martin O'Neill for being unable to afford the \u00a318m needed to make the striker his. Meanwhile, <strong>Vagner Love sees Tottenham or Manchester City as good options for his next club</strong>. A strange idea on the face of it, but then he currently lives in Moscow where he and his family have been threatened with kidnap, putting Tottenham's poor start to the season in perspective.</p> <p>Also seeking a move, though perhaps not quite as desperately, is <strong>Ricardo Vaz Te who just wants a game and will happily go on loan anywhere to get one</strong>. Ricardo isn't alone, in tough times it seems it is often down to players to push through their own moves, and that is just what <strong>Carlos Villanueva</strong> is doing as he tries to force Blackburn to finalise his \u00a35m move from Audax Italiano.</p> <p>Away from all this transfer market shenanigans, it's bad news for the English national team. Yes, that's right, <strong>Manuel Almunia is again claiming he feels he has become an Englishman</strong> and will consider swapping his Spanish passport for a British one next summer, particularly if England still need a goalie. A scenario that is far more likely to come to pass than <strong>Harry Redknapp's attempts to poach David Beckham from under the noses of AC Milan</strong>. Stop laughing at the back, he's deadly serious, listen to this quote he gave the press yesterday: \"I haven't made an inquiry yet, but it has crossed my mind.\" Sounds like a done deal to us.</p> <p>And, finally, The Mill gets all 3am Girls and reports that <strong>Roberto Mancini was seen out and about in trendy London last night</strong>. Was it to attend Chelsea v Roma? Let's hope not for his sake. Or, more intriguingly, was it to talk about <strong>a possible role at Fulham</strong>? Suddenly the Chelsea game looks more appealing.</p>",
  "<p>No one is immune from the economic crisis sweeping the west, the president of the European Union warned today ahead of the opening of the Asia-Europe Meeting in China. </p> <p>Jos\u00e9-Manuel Barroso said that the two continents would \"sink or swim together\", adding that unprecedented cooperation was needed to deal with unprecedented times.</p> <p>\"We have to face serious challenges which don't respect any borders because they are global ... no one in Europe or Asia can seriously pretend to be immune,\" he told a press conference shortly before the opening of the summit in Beijing.</p> <p>\"Simply - we swim together or we sink together ... We need Asia to be on board and more particularly countries like China and India. </p> <p>\"The eye of the storm was in the US, but it is a global storm and there will be ripple effects all over the world.\"</p> <p>Asia and Latin America were already seeing some effects, he added.</p> <p>The ASEM meeting is the largest ever, with 43 countries attending. The EU president pointed out that together they account for almost 60% of the world's GDP, 60% of the world's population and 60% of global trade.</p> <p>Barroso said it was clear that the meeting would be dominated by economic discussions. But he added that climate change would remain a priority, saying the economic and environmental agendas should be mutually reinforcing. </p> <p>He added: \"I hope we will not make the same mistake we made on financial problems. When you see a problem coming, the best way is not to postpone the solution but anticipate the solution.\"</p> <p>The Chinese government has already stressed the need for increased cooperation.</p> <p>Hinting at the longstanding differences between China and Europe over issues such as trade, Barroso added: \"It's important to discuss with Chinese leaders this financial crisis. I very much hope China gives an important solution ... It is not just about finance but global imbalances. Those financial and macroeconomic imbalances are very much at the root of this crisis. It is a great opportunity for China to show a sense of responsibility to address those challenges.\" </p> <p>Those imbalances included \"the level or reserves countries have, the levels of consumption and internal demand compared with other countries.\"</p> <p>Asian countries, particularly China, hold vast foreign currency reserves and the Chinese government itself has argued for a long time that a substantial increase in domestic consumption is needed. </p> <p>Asked whether the crisis might make European countries more sympathetic to sovereign wealth funds - because they need an injection of capital - Barroso replied: \"One thing we should avoid is protection[ism].\"</p> <p>But he added: \"We believe member states can in some circumstances restrict some kinds of investment when they believe those investments can put at risk some important values.\"</p>",

There was some relief these figures were not worse, and DSG also reassured on its banking covenants and said it was cutting capital expenditure by \u00a330m this year.

  "<p>We should all carefully consider the implications of the latest suggestion by the ailing US media giant <a href=\"http://www.tribune.com/\"><strong>Tribune</strong></a>. According to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fafb52ee-a084-11dd-80a0-000077b07658.html\">a <strong>Financial Times</strong> story</a>, it is thinking of acquiring the <strong>Orange County Register</strong> in order to close it down by fusing it with the <strong>Los Angeles Times</strong>.</p> <p>Evidently, Tribune - owned by <strong>Sam Zell</strong> - has held talks with the Register's owner, <a href=\"http://www.freedom.com/\"><strong>Freedom Communications</strong></a>, in order to either buy the title or to make a deal by which the Register and the Times would combine production and distribution operations to save money.</p> <p>Tribune is also loosely entertaining whether it could buy <strong>Copley Press</strong>, the privately held publisher of the <strong>San Diego Union-Tribune</strong>, or to construct a joint operating agreement with it.</p> <p>Of course, in Britain, there has been a long history of papers buying up rivals in order to secure monopolies or reduce competition, especially in major cities. In London for example, the <strong>Evening Standard</strong> \"merged\" with the <strong>Evening News</strong> in 1980, and the News disappeared. </p> <p>Similar mergers have happened among national papers, though not since the <strong>Daily Mail</strong> acquired the <strong>News Chronicle</strong> in 1960. (The Mail did the same to the <strong>Daily Sketch</strong> in 1971, but it was part of the same publishing stable anyway). </p> <p>There has been a similar history of such activity in the States, hence those papers with double-barrelled titles, Herald-Leaders and Register-Journals and so on. But it has been very unusual in the modern era.</p> <p>So a Tribune takeover of the Register would surely attract the hostile attentions of the US regulators who would be concerned about a lack of competition for advertisers. That said, the FT quotes an unnamed banker who said: \"At this point, I think newspapers are in such bad shape that people would allow them to come together.\"</p> <p>That, of course, is the pragmatic view of one reality. But it overlooks the other reality, because there is a competitive environment for advertisers. They are going to the net. </p> <p>In such circumstances, how can regulators, whether in the US or Britain, possibly stop a further round of newsprint newspaper consolidation as cash-strapped companies seek to keep afloat? It is inevitable.</p>",
