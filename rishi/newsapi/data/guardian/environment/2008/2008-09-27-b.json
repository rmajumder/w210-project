  "<p>When Michael Knighton almost bought Manchester United for \u00a320m in 1989, the deal was to give Martin Edwards \u00a310m for his shares and spend a further \u00a310m modernising the Stretford End. The fact that those sums seem ludicrous now - the Glazers paid \u00a3790m for United in 2005 and they didn't use their own money either - just shows how far ahead of the game Knighton was. He might not have built the United brand into the global force it is today, might not have stuck with Alex Ferguson and raked in 10 league titles and two European Cups, but he had complete confidence that you couldn't possibly own Manchester United and lose money. </p> <p>Even though he could not copper up quite enough cash to make his bold vision a reality, history has shown him to be correct. And even if it hadn't, Knighton would have been ready with a trick up his sleeve. 'I could have just sold Ryan Giggs and got my money back,' he said a few years later. 'I'm not saying that's what I would have done, I'm just making the point that United at that price would have been a virtually risk-free investment.' </p> <p>Anyone tempted to view Knighton as a ball-juggling buffoon would do well to remember this hard-headed bit of business arithmetic. Just as anyone tempted to view <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/mike-ashley\">Mike Ashley</a> as a ruthless businessman should note that he bought Newcastle United without completing due diligence and was surprised to discover that rather than owning certain players the club was still paying for them. Knighton was shrewd enough to know that Giggs had cost Manchester United nothing and could be sold for a fortune. Potential result: happiness, in the Knighton household at least. Newcastle cost Ashley so much more than he was expecting to pay that no sooner had he bought the club than he was looking to sell, even as he diminished its value by clumsily alienating Kevin Keegan and the supporters. Actual result: misery, not just in the Ashley household but all over Tyneside. </p> <p>The time has passed for scrutinising Ashley's methods and motives, however. The only question now is where Newcastle are going to end up. When the going was relatively good three or four years ago they were being described as a possible new Leeds, a club with more ambition than income or actual success. That was with all the fans still onside and managers keen to harness all that positive energy. Sam Allardyce thought he had cracked it when he got the Newcastle job and only last season Mark Hughes was known to be disappointed at being passed over in favour of Keegan. </p> <p>Had Terry Venables accepted the job, the parallel with Leeds would have been unmistakable - yet, despite Newcastle having far greater financial security than Leeds under Peter Ridsdale, he turned them down. Ashley has paid the bills but made the job unattractive. That's why he could only target ex-managers. No manager currently in a job is going to leave it to work for Ashley and Dennis Wise on a week-to-week basis. Still, you have to hand it to Ashley. He went straight out and found a manager willing to work on a month-to-month basis, ignoring the fact that Joe Kinnear has never worked north of Nottingham and has been out of the game for longer than Keegan. Short-termism has never been this short.</p> <p>Ashley simply needed a manager so he could offer the club as a going concern. If he can do anything to arrest the slide towards the second division so much the better. If he can't, there will probably be a new manager along in another month. </p> <p>One wonders why Ashley did not put Wise in temporary charge. If the club are sold, the job description of the executive director (football) is likely to be altered anyway. The fans would not have been happy, but they are not exactly thrilled at the moment. Their only hopeful scenario is a quick sale to serious owners, leaving Ashley to escape back to anonymity and the buyers to evaluate the managerial structure. In the worst-case scenario Newcastle hang around like cheese at fourpence and Ashley becomes the living embodiment of an old cautionary tale. Want to know how to make a small fortune out of football? Start off with a massive one.<br><strong><br>West Ham must pay up for cheating</strong></p> <p>Forget the part Carlos Tevez played in West Ham's survival two seasons ago. Forget the fact that Sheffield United could have saved their own skins by beating Wigan at home on the last day. These are side issues. The idea that a precedent is being set whereby promotion and relegation matters will end up being contested in courtrooms is also a fanciful scare story. No one is suggesting that Sheffield United should be promoted or West Ham relegated. All that Lord Griffiths has been asked to consider is a compensation claim, and there is nothing sinister about that. As complicated as the long-running and extremely boring legal wrangle surrounding Tevez's ownership is, Sheffield United's case is straightforward.</p> <p>West Ham broke the rules and knowingly misled the Premier League. That much is admitted. If Sheffield United had won on the last day they would have sent Wigan down instead, and a different team not guilty of breaking any rules would have had a grievance about being relegated while West Ham cheated and stayed up.</p> <p>Neil Warnock is right in saying that is how everyone outside Upton Park sees the matter, or it was until his former players muddied the waters with frivolous claims for loss of earnings. Even West Ham apologists accept that points could have been docked and that the club were lucky to escape such a potentially devastating sanction. That being the case, with Sheffield United clearly suffering a greater financial penalty than the \u00a35.5m fine the FA imposed on West Ham at the time, Blades chairman Kevin McCabe was entitled to seek redress. West Ham may consider they are being punished twice, though by common consent they were the beneficiaries of extraordinary lenience, if not downright weak governance, the first time round. Because they were already in a survival scrap it was felt a points deduction would be too harsh, because it would effectively be a sentence of relegation. Had they been comfortably mid-table, standing to drop only a place or two and lose a bit of television money, a points deduction might well have been applied.</p> <p>What is the team relegated in 18th place supposed to do about logic like that? Crawl away and die? West Ham's \u00a35.5m fine did not benefit Bramall Lane and would have been scant recompense anyway. A figure of around \u00a330m is more realistic. It may sound a lot, but to put it into perspective it is only about three Freddie Ljungbergs. And if the Hammers can't pay or won't pay, they could always do the decent thing and offer to swap places with Sheffield next season.</p> <p><strong>Fifa model is not fit for Hertha fans</strong></p> <p>Football trivia question for the future: which stadium staged a World Cup final then was deemed unsuitable for league football just two years later?</p> <p>Answer: Berlin's Olympiastadion, home to Hertha Berlin and scene of Zinedine Zidane's head-butting antics in the last World Cup final. Even more famously the venue staged the 1936 Olympics, immortalised by Leni Riefenstahl's disturbingly handsome cinematography, and it is the running track separating spectators and pitch that Hertha's fans and sponsors say spoils the atmosphere.</p> <p>There must be a few ghosts from the past as well, as you take the U-Bahn from the city centre towards Spandau and alight near Schloss Charlottenburg, where opponents of the Nazi regime used to meet grisly ends. With parts of the original Olympic arena incorporated into a modern 75,000-seat design, the stadium was a stunning location for the 2006 final, though news that Hertha are leaving due to its 'economical and strategic disadvantages' confirms that the interests of major tournaments and regular football-watchers rarely coincide. Fifa like new-build stadiums in acres of empty parkland, perfect for car parking and corporate entertaining. Fans prefer central locations, as near to the train station and pub as possible. No present Premier League ground would be considered an ideal World Cup venue by Fifa, not even Old Trafford or the Emirates, though at least the former has plenty of parking. The Premier League grounds conforming most closely to Fifa's preferred model, though neither are big enough, are Hull and Stoke.<br><strong><br>Aidy right in respect of a wrong</strong></p> <p>Respect? The FA let off John Terry, Rio Ferdinand and Danny Guthrie, but carpet Aidy Boothroyd (pictured) for losing his cool with the referee who awarded a ludicrous phantom goal he could not possibly have seen. To quote Ian Blanchard, head of national referee development at the Respect launch a couple of months ago: 'Referees have no God-given right to respect on a football field, they have to earn it by being good at their job.' The Watford manager may like to take that line along to his appeal. The rest of us would like the FA to start respecting our intelligence.</p>",
  "<p>This time last year, France was pondering the rise of rugby and the possibility that it might overtake football. Rugby was deemed family-friendly and, if what happened on the field was sometimes incomprehensible, the image of players belting lumps out of each other and then embracing at the end struck an attractive chord.</p> <p>Football's inclusiveness, meanwhile, was threatened - in Paris in particular - by the racists and political extremists who ganged up in the stadiums. Petulance ruled on the field. With France's Rugby World Cup just about to begin, this was a golden opportunity to give football a good kicking.</p> <p>It never quite happened. The crowds flocked to the RWC fixtures from start to finish, but for the rugby revolution to succeed, the French team had to play their part. They finished fourth, losing twice to Argentina, and in the semi-final to England, of all people, in Paris, of all places. </p> <p>In the Six Nations that followed the World Cup, France, now under new coach Marc Li\u00e8vremont, flickered brilliantly and then flopped. The assault on the great god, Football, had stalled. </p> <p>In England, one month into a new rugby season, it may be overzealous to suggest that a new charge is underway. Football fills our pages first, the dominant force in this medium, as in all other media. And yet rugby comes ever more warmly wrapped in wholesomeness, its traditional match-day welcome complemented by a commercial attention to good service. </p> <p>It may be worth pointing out, on that money-making front, that rugby clubs that own their grounds have a material advantage over those that ground-share. Worcester, for example, are better off at Sixways, a purpose-built home on the edge of their city and right by the M5, than Saracens at Watford FC, an arrangement that still feels like an exile. </p> <p>Harlequins are more secure, and not just currently in the Premiership, than the reigning champions, Wasps. The Stoop is a rugby destination; Adams Park is a rented space at the end of an industrial park in High Wycombe, whose very name makes a slight mockery of the London before Wasps. </p> <p>No matter; it's all relative, since there are opportunities galore for all the contestants in an ambitious sport, even in these days of credit crunch. In fact, you could say that rugby offers relatively cheap relief from the pains of real life, or the costs of following football. </p> <p>This being rugby, there must be a but. It comes not so much in the form of the experimental law variations - called 'global ELVs', although they are peculiar to our hemisphere at the moment - as in the 'protocols' from the International Rugby Board. These were reminders to referees to apply the letter of the law at the breakdown, or the post-tackle situation, as I think they prefer to call the scramble for the ball after contact. </p> <p>Basically, the dictate was to keep everybody on their feet, entering through the correct portal and binding to a team-mate. Clearing out, for the sake of inflicting maximum damage on an opponent, was forbidden. </p> <p>Well, the Premiership hasn't cracked the protocol yet. September has been dominated by a kicking game that at least prevents the ball from going into the tackle area, where anybody can be -and is being - penalised.</p> <p>The ELVs were developed, painstakingly, as a result of the way England played in order to win the World Cup of 2003. That's a long time ago. At the same time as the ELV trials were taking place at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, however, a universal process of accelerated evolution was launched. The England of 2003 were admired, but it was time to move on.</p> <p>By 2005, the Lions, built by Sir Clive Woodward on an England model, looked antiquated. Wales had already won the grand slam that year with a much more adventurous game. Without any prompting from the IRB, the game was self-adjusting. </p> <p>But the die had been cast. Along came the ELVs and with them all the danger of schism. New Zealand and Australia, historically much more adventurous in their acceptance of rapid change, saw only good in the 'hybrid' laws that governed the last Super 14 and Tri Nations.</p> <p>Europe, by tradition far more cautious, opted out of the law that replaced penalties for all bar the most serious offences with free-kicks, and settled for the 'global' set. Reluctant already to believe that the laws were forged to encourage open play, England found themselves suddenly in the grip of a double whammy of doubt, the protocols arriving at the same time as the ELVs.</p> <p>Rugby is basking off the field in an Indian summer of success around the clubs. There is a load to look forward to, from the Heineken Cup to the November internationals, but on the field there is concern, irritation even - a set-to between coaches Dean Richards of Harlequins and Dean Ryan of Gloucester would be worth paying an old-style banker's bonus to see - as harsh reality grapples with good intention. </p> <p>The ELVs were unnecessary; the protocols a decree too far. But we're stuck with them and the last thing rugby needs is for its practitioners, its entertainment arm, to try to unpick a knot tied by dogmatic hands in Dublin, scout hut of the IRB.</p> <p>The coaches will find a way through and the players will adapt. Until they do, we may have to place the rugby revolution on hold. Gone for a rethink. Can't catch football yet. Back in five.</p>",
  "<p>It is the first day of the New Orleans Saints' 2008 season, and I am in the vertiginous media eyrie of the city's iconic Superdome. I am listening as 70,000 voices are whipped into cacophony by the pom-poms of the 'Saintsations ', two carefully divergent mascots, a marching band, someone riding a Harley for reasons I miss and, finally, the Saints themselves. Three years ago, in Hurricane Katrina's devastating wake, it looked as if the team would abandon their home town. Now \u2013 a month before they travel to Wembley to take on the San Diego Chargers \u2013 the se historic underachievers have become the shining hope of a city reborn.</p> <p>Today's atmosphere has been intensified because five days ago the people of New Orleans had fled from the approaching Hurricane Gustav. The remaining population of the city could have fitted into the Louisiana Superdome seven times over. No one can forget what happened here in 2005, when an underprepared government left vulnerable thousands sheltering in the stadium to starve and wallow in their own mire.</p> <p>But New Orleans was determined to redeem itself. At the cost of nearly $200m, around half of it paid by the federal disaster relief agency Fema, the largest fixed-dome structure in the world was returned to action in little over a year. It is a soaring behemoth, defiant and air-conditioned in the sweltering dog days of the Louisiana summer.</p> <p>More Super Bowls \u2013 six \u2013 have been held here than at any other stadium. The epic scale of the enclosed space, the way this magnifies the noise, the sheer spectacle of the venue, they all amaze. The 83-metre-high dome has a diameter of 210m and encloses a volume of 3.5m cubic meters \u2013 enough to hold 6,200,000,000 pints, which is about how much weak lager the fans seem to have drunk so far.</p> <p>And it's only noon. When I walked here through the steaming morning, the streets were lined with parties full of enormous fans barbecuing enormous slabs of meat and handing them out to whoever happened past.</p> <p>I was told to expect this by Mary Beth Romig, a tiny, pretty woman with a big truck, who is a spokeswoman for the city and adores the Saints. Her father, Jerry, has been the Saints' stadium announcer for nearly 40 years, and their families both lost their homes in Katrina. 'New Orleans is like a big small town,' Romig says. Everywhere we go, from the posh Garden District to the shattered Lower Ninth ward, people know her. She says the same would have happened whoever I was with.</p> <p>Come game time, Matt Bryant kicks off for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs' defensive unit was second-best in the NFL last year, while they have an experienced quarterback in JeffGarcia. Sports Illustrated reckons they will win this season's NFC South division, with New Orleans third.</p> <p>The first five minutes make a nonsense of this prediction. Saints quarterback Drew Brees orchestrates a drive that ends in a 39-yard touchdown pass to David Patten. All the trauma of Gustav, all the anguish of evacuation, seems to vanish in the echoing dome.</p> <p>Many pundits predicted the Saints would desert New Orleans after Katrina. The stadium was trashed, the city's population plummeted. The franchise's crusty owner, Tom Benson, who made his fortune with a string of car dealerships, refused to rule out taking the Saints to one of the many bigger cities \u2013 such as Los Angeles \u2013 that do not have an NFL team and are desperate for one.</p> <p>Enter Rita Benson LeBlanc , Benson's grand daughter. During college, she was an intern at the NFL's New York office, earning the respect of Joe Browne, the NFL's executive vice-president. In 2003, still in her twenties, she was put in charge of the Saints' sister team, the VooDoo, who play in the smaller Arena Football League. She ramped up the marketing, improved the 'fan experience', built attendance and was named the league's top executive.</p> <p>Shunted between stadiums, the Saints had a terrible 2005. Early in 2006, Benson LeBlanc was named owner/ executive vice- president. Like every other New Orleanian who had to make a conscious investment in the city, she treated Katrina as a watershed. 'No one had anything familiar to attach to. It changed the consciousness of the entire community.'</p> <p>She oversaw efforts to find season-ticket holders displaced by the hurricane who had not returned to the city and helped arrange ticket prices for as low as $14 per game, as an incentive for them to come home. As a result, the Saints sold out of season tickets for the first time \u2013 there is now a waiting list tens of thousands strong \u2013 and the Superdome is packed for every game.</p> <p>The return to the Superdome in September 2006 was a spine-tingling emotional triumph. After a concert by U2 and Green Day, climaxing with the Katrina charity song 'The Saints Are Coming', the 23-3 victory over the Atlanta Falcons was ESPN's highest-rated programme ever. The subsequent season was the team's best ever, taking them to within a game of the Super Bowl.</p> <p>But dreams end. In 2007, the Saints opened with five straight losses. They are stuttering today as well. After that imperious first drive, silly penalties put quarterback Drew Brees under pressure near his own endzone. He is tackled as he attempts a pass and the Bucs' Phillip Buchanon intercepts for a touchdown.</p> <p>During the incessant ad-breaks, we are regaled with sponsors' messages and big-screen stunts. The best is the 'kiss cam', which picks out couples who are obliged to snog each other for the entertainment of the multitude. This should definitely happen at Lord's.</p> <p>There are hardly any Tampa fans here. When, with 30 seconds left in the third quarter, the Bucs score their second field goal to go ahead for the first time, the silence is weird. After the uplifting start, the wave of post-Gustav relief, is this back to business as usual for the team once known as the 'Aints'?</p> <p>The city itself has a new resilience. The day before the game, Mary Beth Romig drove me to a swath of new developments rising out of the shattered bones of the Lower Ninth , the scene of Katrina's most-televised devastation. We saw an eco-friendly test house in Holy Cross erected by Global Green, and the first five homes built by Brad Pitt's Make It Right charity, which has directed architects to design affordable housing that is hurricane-prepared, green and pays homage to the city's traditional architecture. These five houses gleam amid a waste of derelict lots, and dozens more are coming. The multicoloured streets of the nearby musicians' village are being rebuilt by the volunteers of Habitat for Humanity, supported by New Orleanian musicians Harry Connick Jr and Branford Marsalis.</p> <p>One of the first residents of the Make It Right houses, security guard Ken Jordan, stayed indoors when Gustav hit, wandered outside afterwards and said : 'Oh God, I didn't know it was this bad.' As Rita Benson LeBlanc says : 'Things have been put in place that are better than what we had before.'</p> <p>This goes for the Saints, too. Benson LeBlanc explains how the franchise changed how they thought about personnel. 'We wanted mature players, people who really understood the situation in this city.' If the Saints are emblematic of the reborn New Orleans, Drew Brees is emblematic of the reborn Saints.</p> <p>After starting his career with the San Diego Chargers \u2013 which adds further spice to the upcoming fixture at Wembley \u2013 Brees suffered an awful shoulder injury. His surgeon James Andrew said his chances of a successful comeback were 500-1. But Benson LeBlanc and the Saints' new head coach Sean Payton took a leap of faith, and it has been magnificently rewarded. 'When we came here,' Brees said later, 'I was in the process of rebuilding as well.'</p> <p>He and his wife Brittany threw themselves into New Orleans life and reconstruction. Their charitable work, especially with local kids and schools, is geared towards giving their new home a durable future. Everyone I meet adores them. 'They're just great,' Romig says. 'If they see you in a restaurant, they come over and chat, and they really understand what the city needs. We're incredibly lucky to have such outstanding young people.'</p> <p>I ask my neighbour in the press box what makes Brees so special as a person, and he says: 'It's the same thing makes him special as a player. He understands stuff. It's between his ears.' With seconds to go in the third quarter, close to his own line, Brees sees that Tampa Bay are about to be penalised and instantly realises he has licence to throw a long pass to speedster wide-receiver Devery Henderson , who races for an 84-yard touchdown, holding the ball joyfully towards his helpless would-be tackler like a helmeted Usain Bolt. The tight game ends in a 24-20 Saints victory.</p> <p>Asked to compare today's post-Gustav atmosphere with the 2006 Superdome return, coach Sean Payton says : 'We will probably go to our death beds trying to find something to match that.' That magical night has become a cherished symbol of New Orleans' refusal to be beaten. But, say some people, the city is still in trouble \u2013 the population is falling, the crime rate is high, and can it survive repeated evacuations?</p> <p>Certainly, the Saints' revival is a simplistic metaphor for the complex, con\ufb02 icted story of post-Katrina New Orleans. But the Saints have given a broken city something to dream about. That's why Benson LeBlanc and New Orleans are excited about coming to Wembley. 'We want to show the world what we're about,' she says. New Orleanians want to show us that three-year-old pictures of the destroyed, underprepared Ninth ward don't represent their resilient, recovering city. The Saints do. Go Saints.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The New Orleans Saints play the San Diego Chargers at Wembley on 26 October. For more information, visit <a href=\"http://www.NFLuk.com\">NFLuk.com</a>.

  "<p>It is easy to understand why people are so upset with Fifa. They could hardly have got it more wrong with their limp fine of the Croatian FA last week in response to the country's fans' monkey-baiting of Emile Heskey when England turned into Brazil in Zagreb earlier this month. </p> <p>This is an organisation about as connected to popular sentiment as Wall Street. Not only did the punishment not fit the crime, it went to the wrong people. Then again, how do you fine thousands of supporters? We'll come to that later. </p> <p>This was a \u00a314,500 slap - which sounded more when announced in Zurich as 30,000 Swiss francs. What was called for was a good clout. Fining the governing body the equivalent of a player's daily wage will do nothing to deter Croatia's racists, who have been carrying on this way (in the manner of some England fans over the years, in fact) at least since France '98. When Croatia played Japan in a Group match in Nantes, I witnessed the Croatian fans, bare-chested, drunk and grunting like, well, monkeys, as they belittled and bemused the perfectly behaved Japanese supporters. It was a vivid clash of cultures. </p> <p>That was Croatia's first World Cup as an independent nation. These were proud, if misguided, nationalists masquerading as football supporters. And what country doesn't have a fair selection of those? </p> <p>However, at the next World Cup, in Japan and South Korea, the visiting hordes from around the world could hardly have been more polite, civilised by their wonderful hosts almost without knowing it. For once, hooligans and racists must have felt distinctly out of place at an international football tournament. With the odd blip, it was the same in Germany. And it doesn't bear thinking about if the 2010 World Cup in South Africa brings the Neanderthals out of their caves. </p> <p>Still, if Fifa's cowardice last week served any purpose it was to drag the discussion about racism back into the tabloids. </p> <p>It was encouraging to see the Daily Mail and the Sun (who each regard themselves as the most reliable barometer of national opinion on everything from global warming to who should play on the left side of England's now brilliant football team) in such a lather over the Croatian story. </p> <p>Because, whatever allegedly high-brow newspapers like this one say to our hopefully liberal and discerning readers, it is in the popular prints, as they were once quaintly known, where you feel the pulse of people who either indulge in this sort of behaviour or are appalled by it and pay heed to the shouting headlines. That's not to say tabloids do not have intelligent readers, or that The Observer is read only by right-on intellectuals. But both know their target audiences. </p> <p>The screaming headlines now are models of the 'political correctness' their editors and columnists used to despise. Once racism was a taboo subject. Now condemning it sells. </p> <p>As do football shirts - and who among those opinion formers even 10 years ago would have predicted that a mixed-race England footballer would one day be shifting more of them than his white team-mates? But the charm, dignity and encouraging excellence of Theo Walcott are turning him into the new David Beckham, on the field and in the shops. </p> <p>That's a positive. If Croatia had such a player, maybe they would be less inclined to abuse black opponents. We are dealing with a very suggestible constituency, after all - and that is why Fifa have missed a great opportunity to come down hard on the miscreants. They did not have the power to go to the root cause of the racism - but they could have taken away the one thing that excites the mob: football. </p> <p>It's what Uefa did to English clubs after the horror of Heysel in 1985. That exclusion, combined with a concerted police strategy, underpinned by closed-circuit TV and a culture of group thuggery that was already tired, did much to undermine hooliganism. </p> <p>It is easy to forget how awful England fans - that most confusing of demographics - have been. Give a twit a flag and it won't be long before he disgraces it and himself, and England were world champions at idiocy for quite a time. In fact, their counterparts in other countries, including Croatia, looked up to them. </p> <p>They have been aped - if you will pardon the appropriate pun - in Holland, Germany, Spain, Macedonia, Russia, Italy and who knows where else. They popularised vulgarity. </p> <p>England fans, largely, have moved on, bored with the excesses of the previous generation. The football team might not quite be the new Brazil yet, but the vast majority of their supporters have at least learned how to behave like reasonably civilised human beings.</p>",
  "<p>America's liberals are pinching themselves in delight and disbelief at the surprising emergence of a self-proclaimed 'butch dyke' as a star of America's cable television news.</p> <p>Rachel Maddow, whose publicity material describes her as 'the first openly gay Rhodes scholar', was only given her own show on the MSNBC cable network on 8 September, but she has already doubled the ratings. Last week she even beat CNN's veteran Larry King.</p> <p>Liberals are thrilled because America's cable TV news has long been the preserve of angry right-wing white male presenters, such as Fox News hosts Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. </p> <p>Thirty-five-year-old Maddow's low-key humour, rigorous research and empathetic approach has made her the overnight darling of the liberal media. One rapturous blogger called her 'the Everlasting Progressive, the Princess of News'. </p> <p>'Ms Maddow's deep, modulated voice is reassuringly calm after so much shrill emotionalism and catfights among the channel's ageing, white male divas,' says Alessandra Stanley, television reviewer for the New York Times</p> <p>The success of The Rachel Maddow Show has helped to position MSNBC - the cable news division of NBC - as the anti-Fox News network.</p> <p>Maddow is also proving that a woman can be a big ratings draw on cable TV news. Even so, she believes her long wait for her own show was 'not only because I am gay, but because of what I look like. I am not a Barbie girl with Barbie doll-like looks.'</p> <p>Despite her sudden rise to stardom, Maddow has not come out of nowhere. Since 2005, she has had her own evening show on Air America, the liberal radio network. There she established herself as a 'smiling but obstinate liberal', as she has put it. In 2006 Maddow became a regular guest political analyst on CNN and MSNBC.</p> <p>'The one time Fox News ever asked me to be a guest,' she told the New York Times, 'was when Madonna made news by kissing another famous female, Britney Spears. They thought I had expertise, maybe. I said, \"No, duh\".'</p> <p>Maddow came out as a lesbian when she was just 15. 'You have to learn to survive and prosper in a hostile environment,' she has said. At Stanford University in the early Nineties, a university newspaper noted she was one of only two openly gay freshmen. When a reporter later asked if the other gay freshman was her girlfriend, Maddow said: 'Funnily enough, only one other person was out, and she was not one of the many girls I was sleeping with.' Maddow majored in public policy and became an Aids activist. Winning a Rhodes scholarship to Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1995, she got her doctorate in political science, studying Aids and prison reform.</p> <p>When she returned to America to finish her dissertation, she supported herself doing odd jobs, cleaning buckets in a coffee-bean factory and working as a handyman. That's how, in 1999, she met her girlfriend, Susan Mikula, an artist. Mikula had been looking for a 'yard boy' to help out with her house in Massachusetts.</p> <p>Maddow is no knee-jerk liberal and says she is 'frequently underwhelmed' by Barack Obama. Although she believes he was right to oppose the Iraq war, 'his war policy stuff now is total bullshit. [Withdrawing] one or two brigades a month? You want your son to be in the last brigade?'</p>",
  "<p>It used to be called Stinky Town - a smoke-belching, coal-burning industrial powerhouse in what was once the heart of East Germany. But the old folk of Spremberg no longer have to check which way the wind is blowing before venturing outside. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Spremberg, or 'Stink-Stadt', made history. It is now host to the world's first power plant that collects emissions from coal burning and pipes them deep underground. Built by Swedish power firm Vattenfall, it emits up to 90 per cent less carbon dioxide than a conventional facility. The process it employs, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), is seen by a growing coalition of power companies, financiers, academics - and even campaign groups including Greenpeace and WWF - as the silver bullet in the fight against climate change.</p> <p>Regarded as the best the way to secure affordable electricity without polluting the atmosphere, CCS could also facilitate the return in the UK of a new era for coal, a 'dirty' fossil fuel whose fate had seemed sealed. </p> <p>The next 10 days will determine if CCS, which is expensive and still unproven, has a future. A vote in the European parliament will decide whether the first 12 demonstration projects receive a \u20ac12bn (\u00a39.5bn) subsidy. Failure to reach agreement - and Europe is split over the proposal - will mean a delay of at least two years while the search goes on for alternative funding mechanisms. </p> <p>On Tuesday of next week, members of the European environment committee will consider an amendment by Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies, who is seen as the champion of the CCS movement in Europe. Davies's powerful lobbying has successfully short-circuited the legislative process. If his amendment is passed, he has been given permission to take it directly to EU president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso and the Council of Ministers - the environment ministers of the 27 European member states - for rubber-stamping early next year.</p> <p>The Davies amendment is part of legislation aiming to reconfigure Europe's emissions trading scheme. Davies has inserted a clause that would allow firms building CCS power plants to sell carbon allowances via the scheme, on condition that the new plants actually work and succeed in burying CO2</p> <p>Power firms would be paid the \u20ac12bn subsidy retrospectively. The first wave of CCS plants will cost about \u20ac1bn more than equivalent conventional power stations. Davies argues, however, that CCS will ultimately be cost-effective, although only once the knowledge gleaned from the demonstration projects is shared and refined to allow economies of scale to kick in. Supporters are encouraged by a report published last week by management consultants McKinsey that backed his case.</p> <p>More than 60 coal-fired power stations could be built across Europe if CCS takes off, and a number are planned for the UK. John Hutton, Labour's Business Secretary, told the party conference in Manchester last Monday that he would take on critics of new coal and nuclear power stations, arguing that their construction was vital to securing Britain's long-term energy needs. </p> <p>But last week the influential UK Environment Agency warned that on no account should coal-fired stations get the go-ahead until CCS is a proven technology, because otherwise the increased CO2 they produce would be devastating. It is understood that the cabinet is split on allowing Eon to build a coal-fired station at Kingsnorth in Kent that will be 'CCS-ready', but which is not conceived from the start as a CCS facility.</p> <p>Davies acknowledges this concern and has inserted another amendment in the legislation that will mean the closure of 'dirty' power stations across Europe, with only those emitting less than 500g of CO2 every kilowatt hour being allowed. Really dirty stations emit almost three times that figure.</p> <p>Until recently, Davies's plan appeared to have little chance of passing through the European parliament: opposition from accession countries led by Poland looked to have defeated the measures. But in recent weeks the tide has turned. There is now a chance the 60 members of the committee will approve the package, seeing it as a way of meeting medium-term emissions targets. Europe has set itself a CO2 reduction target of 20 per cent by 2020 and 60 to 80 per cent by 2050. Successful CCS could slash European CO2 emission by 20 per cent.</p> <p>There are global implications for the MEPs' decision. If Europe cannot reach agreement, it will enter international climate change talks in Copenhagen designed to replace the Kyoto Protocol with no sign that it is taking a lead on the issue. Without a European CCS funding commitment, it has been suggested that it will prove difficult to persuade China to act on climate change and other countries to act on deforestation. </p> <p>In addition, European parliamentary elections next year will slow down any EU agreements on new CCS projects. </p> <p>Ian Temperton of investment firm Climate Change Capital, says: 'Money is absolutely needed. These programmes won't happen without support. We are effectively already in the middle of the next decade in terms of the lead time for getting these plants up and running. If we don't modify existing legislation we will miss the opportunity. If we want to demonstrate that Europe is able to show the world leadership in the most difficult energy area, this is something we have to do.'</p> <p>Developing CCS has created a Europe-wide alliance of power firms. A new body in Brussels known as the Zero Emissions Platform is attempting to secure next week's vote. Members of the ZEP include BP, Shell, WWF and a range of European firms. Leading the organisation is Dr Graeme Sweeney, who heads Shell's future fuels division. </p> <p>BP and Shell have invested heavily in the controversial Canadian oil sands, which require a more energy-intensive process than conventional oil extraction because hot air and steam are needed to make 'heavy' oil flow into reservoirs. Some suggest that oil sands require double the energy usually needed for production. Shell disputes that, putting the figure at just 15 per cent more. Whatever the truth, the oil giants need to capture their emissions via CCS to offset the higher energy use required for oil-sands exploitation. The same argument applies to many of their natural gas finds. </p> <p>Keith Allott, WWF's climate change adviser, says: 'Potentially, CCS can play a significant role in moving away from a disastrous high-carbon future. We're seeing new proposals for new coal-fired power stations in the UK and Europe. Europe needs to show leadership and this is why we need to fund well-focused demonstration projects.'</p> <p>Next week, we will know whether his wish has been granted.</p> <h2>Fossils still alive</h2> <p>The International Energy Agency says that global electricity production will nearly double by 2030. Even with increased reliance on renewables and investment in energy efficiency, fossil fuels are likely to remain at around 65 per cent of the total energy mix for decades. </p> <p>The world is returning to coal as demand for electricity increases. In China, a new coal-fired power station opens every other week. Today, 40 per cent of the world's electricity comes from coal, with a fair chance of that share increasing. Unless CCS can be successfully deployed, many experts regard this as a nightmare scenario.</p>",
  "<p>There is a simple reason why US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's $700bn bail-out package has been so hard to sell to politicians and the American people: it won't really work. Despite the historically massive expenditure and all the little clauses to make sure Wall Street fat cats get their comeuppance, the plan is unlikely to do anything to save the world's biggest economy from a long and crippling downturn.</p> <p>It will doubtless save some banks from collapse, but is that worth the government putting itself on the hook for nearly a trillion dollars - more than $3,000 for every man, woman and child in America? And that's not the half of it. Not bailing out Wall Street - with as much money as it would take to launch an American National Health Service - presents an even bleaker prospect: a financial nuclear winter that could last a generation. In short, America is doomed if it does and even more doomed if it doesn't get Paulson's billions, perhaps the ugliest economic choice it has ever faced.</p> <p>You can always rely on 'Neutron Jack' Welch, the former GE boss and all-round tough talker, to tell it how it is. 'I now believe we are in for one hell of a deep downturn,' he told the World Business Forum in New York last Wednesday, adding that the first quarter of 2009 will be 'brutal'.</p> <p>Until recently, Welch said, he had believed the American economy could avoid recession, but he has changed his mind, despite the bail-out. 'I am now caving,' he said. 'Get ready for real tough times. They're coming.'</p> <p>Welch is not alone in his gloomy outlook. A day after the New York meeting, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, the German finance minister, predicted America will soon be knocked off its perch as the world's leading economic superpower.</p> <p>If you peel away this hyperbole, however, and consider the ramifications of such large-scale government intervention into the market as Paulson's bail-out represents, even Steinbr\u00fcck's seemingly gratuitous slight sounds plausible.</p> <p>The first question anyone thinking about the bail-out should surely ask is whether $700bn is enough, or indeed too much, to fix things. And where did that figure come from? David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor's, the New York credit rating agency, suggests that all the 'level 3' assets of all the biggest financial firms on Wall Street adds up to about $630bn. But this valuation is arbitrary at best, seeing as these sub-prime or toxic securities are only really worth what the market - or in this case the US Treasury Department - is willing to pay for them.</p> <p>'I think the biggest risk to the financial system is if it turns out to be not enough,' says Barry Bosworth, a former economic adviser to President Carter and a senior economist at The Brookings Institution, a left-leaning Washington think-tank.</p> <p>It is impossible to know how much money will be needed to mop up all of America's sub-prime- related securitised debt because we don't yet know how the Treasury intends to go about buying it. 'There is so little agreement on this point - on whether it should be a traditional auction or a reverse auction or some other process - that the whole structure could very well fracture,' Bosworth says. 'There is not enough detail.' </p> <p>And the seemingly flawed mechanics of the bail-out are just the tip of the iceberg. Assuming the plan actually gets off the ground and the Treasury is able to organise some kind of workable asset sale, what will happen to the US economy once the banks have been 'saved'? Will house prices automatically start to stabilise? Will jobs be created as if by magic? Will Americans suddenly find they have disposable income on hand to get their consumer-weighted economy whirring away again? Of course not.</p> <p>And that is the plan's biggest flaw. 'My biggest fear is that all of this money, and it really is a very large amount, is going to be spent and none of it will be used to stimulate the economy,' Bosworth says.</p> <p>In fact it is entirely possible that the economy will become even more paralysed after the bail-out than it is today, because the government will put such a strain on the already-creaking public finances that it will not be in a position to provide any sort of stimulus for a long time to come. America will be unable to spend its way out of this crisis.</p> <p>Most critics of Paulson's plan express concern over US taxpayers shelling out billions of dollars to bail out greedy Wall Street bankers, but this is a misconception. Taxpayers, who have been shocked by the scale of earnings of all-too-fallible 'masters of the universe' such as Lehman Brothers' Dick Fuld and Bear Stearns' Jimmy Cayne (see panel) are not directly paying for this; nor will they ever, because America does not have $700bn of taxpayers' money. The government is in debt to the tune of $9.8 trillion. The entire sum will probably be borrowed from foreign governments and other purchasers of US Treasury bonds - which creates further problems.</p> <p>'Borrowing every penny of this $700bn could have very serious consequences,' Bosworth says. 'Firstly, investors from other countries are going to see this as the biggest example yet of America's lack of financial discipline. They may then very well decide they should not invest so heavily here and diversify their portfolios to invest less in US Treasuries, dollars and US equities and more in European bonds and the euro.'</p> <p>This, of course, will drive the already weakened dollar down even further, which will not only suck more lifeblood out of the American economy but drive up the dollar-denominated price of oil and other commodities, adding inflationary pressure into the bargain. Talk about kicking a country while it is down.</p> <p>Vincent Reinhart is a senior economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank normally the antithesis of Brookings and its liberal scholars. He is in a particularly good position to criticise Paulson and Fed chairman Ben Bernanke's latest work because he worked for the Federal Reserve for more than 25 years, much of it as a director on the monetary affairs board.</p> <p>On the subject of the bail-out, however, he agrees almost entirely with Bosworth. In fact he goes even further, suggesting that what has been dubbed 'Tarp' (the Troubled Asset Relief Programme) will all but cripple whoever wins the presidential election in November.</p> <p>'Who would want to be President and inherit this mess?' Reinhart asks, adding that most of the big decisions in the victor's entire four-year term will be made by the Bush administration before inauguration day in January. 'The whole four years will likely be bogged down in very dull financial regulation and legislation relating to this bill.'</p> <p>What is more, with such immense pressure on public finances from the size of the debt incurred to fund it, Barack Obama can forget about spending increases and John McCain won't have any room for tax cuts. So whoever wins will be unable to fulfil many of their manifesto pledges.</p> <p>The next President will also face the prospect of a global depression to manage, and with it the possibility of strained relations with foreign governments.</p> <p>China, so dependent on the US as top buyer of its manufactured goods, faces an abrupt slowdown as Americans tighten their belts. This of course will mean that China and other nations will be less able to purchase huge wads of US Treasuries even if they wanted to, further restricting America's access to funds. 'It certainly will change our relationship with our trading partners,' Reinhart says.</p> <p>It is almost as if Paulson and Bernanke have created a plan that will see them through the next few months without concern for the long-term effects of their actions. 'I regard this as nothing more than a stopgap measure to get us through the election,' says S&amp;P's Wyss.</p> <p>After the Latin American financial crisis in the 1980s, the leading countries of Asia and the Pacific Rim said such a collapse could never happen to them. But in just a few years their economies were falling like dominoes.</p> <p>And as Japan, Singapore and Taiwan were failing, Americans looked on and observed that such endemic economic troubles only happened in developing economies such as Asia and Latin America, and could never happen in their great nation. They were wrong.</p>",
  "<p>It's 1998 and I'm trying to interview Anna Kournikova. It's a bit like attempting to secure an audience with a world leader, which, Kournikova's handlers would have you believe, she is. Billed as 'the most downloaded female on the planet', she is flanked by a battalion of handlers, agents, managers and other assorted obstructionists.</p> <p>There are months of delays and unreturned calls. When I am favoured with the courtesy of a response, the communication is annoying in the extreme. Can you send questions in advance? Can you embed references to the products of Anna's sponsors in whatever you write? That would really help speed the process! Finally, after more than a year, I am granted a 10-minute session at a hotel in New Jersey where Kournikova is being paid a prince(ss)ly fee to play in a weekend tennis exhibition. Monitored by yet another handler, she spends the excruciating session chomping on pink gum, staring at her nails, and performing a nimble feat of dialogue by giving yes/no answers to questions that begin with the word 'how'.</p> <p>It's 2008 and I'm trying to interview Anna Kournikova. Half an hour before the meeting, my mobile chirps. I steel myself for a call apologising for a last-minute change of plans. But, no, it's Anna - on an unblocked number - confirming that she is running on schedule and if I'm having trouble finding a parking space at the Starbucks where we are scheduled to meet, I can always park at the adjacent Whole Foods. She arrives alone, pulling up in a tasteful but hardly ostentatious car. She makes eye contact. She chews no gum. Ninety minutes into what is more a conversation than an interview, she is still going strong. No, I'm forced to admit, I have not read the book Eat, Pray, Love. 'You really should,' she says. 'It's spiritual, but well written at the same time.'</p> <p>She's 27 now and, while she pretty much looks the same, Anna Kournikova bears only the vaguest resemblance to the one-woman international conglomerate that damn near hijacked women's tennis a decade ago. While she is unwilling to concede that she has retired, she has not played a WTA Tour match in more than five years. The regal prom queen who once remarked to a suitor, 'You can't afford me,' is now recommending literature. The tennis mercenary who allegedly made $50m in off-court income before the age of 18 is now an ambassador for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America - which sounds like so much PR until you learn that in April she went to gritty Tijuana, Mexico, to help open a youth facility.</p> <p>When it's pointed out how little the Kournikova of today conforms to the image she created years ago, she nods her head so forcefully her Gucci sunglasses nearly fly off her face. 'Of course I'm a different person! People say, \"I can't believe how much you've changed!\" What did they expect? People grow, evolve. It would be sad if I didn't change!'</p> <p>Kournikova is now a Ripo - Russian in passport only. She holds a green card and lives full-time in Miami Beach, the port she entered in 1992, when she was a 10-year-old prodigy armed with talent and attitude in equal measure. 'When Anna won a point, it wasn't an achievement,' recalls Nick Bollettieri, her first American coach. 'That was how it was supposed to go. I mean, she was Anna Kournikova.' At 14 she won the Orange Bowl, the top international junior event. In 1997, aged 16, she lost in the semi-finals at Wimbledon to Martina Hingis. The next year, she beat Hingis, Lindsay Davenport and Steffi Graf, reached the fourth round of the US and French Opens, and cracked the top 20. Anna Inc. was open for business.</p> <p>The Kournikova phenomenon was a classic case of harmonic convergence. Women's sports - tennis in particular - were growing in popularity, eyed as a promising frontier by sports marketers. The internet enabled fans from Minsk to Minneapolis to access Kournikova in a way they never could, say, Chris Evert. As the global economy kicked in, you could scarcely find a more ideal exponent for it than an exotic Russian who spoke flawless English and performed all over the world.</p> <p>Kournikova embraced it all. A daughter of communism (she was born in Moscow in 1981) took commercialism to new extremes. She endorsed products from watches to brokerage firms to sports bras, virtually every campaign built around her looks rather than her athletic prowess. When she was not pushing products, she was striking come-hither poses for magazines. The pundits could debate whether this was a feminist setback or a feminist triumph. 'What is she supposed to say, \"No, I don't want your money?\" That's like winning the lottery and then saying, \"No, I don't really deserve it,\"' no less than Martina Navratilova once said of Kournikova. Meanwhile, Kournikova was making bundles of cash for her sponsors, her tour, her agents and, not least, herself. Nathalie Tauziat, a higher-ranked but less publicised WTA player at the time, called Kournikova 'a blonde windfall'.</p> <p>But Kournikova's cult of personality exacted a price on her tennis. While the contagion known as Annamania raged and hormonally charged boys showed up en masse at women's tennis matches, an inconvenient truth persisted: Kournikova had never won a singles tournament. Pitted against the hype, her ability had little chance. Distraction was her destruction. In the retelling, Kournikova was the tennis equivalent of the NFL's William 'The Fridge' Perry, a unique physical specimen rather than a creditable athlete. </p> <p>In truth - and this is what gives the story a slightly tragic ring - Kournikova was abundantly gifted. She played whimsical, well rounded tennis and excelled at the net, an area of the court most contemporary players avoid as if it were quicksand. She reached as high as eighth in the singles rankings and in 1999 was the world's top doubles player. But the weight of never having won a title ultimately crushed her. 'I put pressure on myself, especially as I got older,' she says. 'At 16, 17 you have no fear. You don't think or analyse. You just play on automatic. You can get smarter as you get older, but in sports you can be too smart, you know?'</p> <p>Her fragile psyche was compounded by a fragile body. Foot, back and ankle injuries forestalled her career. By the spring of 2003 she was playing low-level events in an attempt to revive her game. That May she withdrew from a match against a 16-year-old arriviste named Maria Sharapova. The following week in Charlottesville, Virginia, she lost to a Brazilian ranked outside the top 300 and has not played a sanctioned match since.</p> <p>Her impact went beyond internet photo galleries. Following the trail blazed at least in part by Kournikova, there are five players in the WTA's top 10 from Russia or the former Soviet Union. 'Anna,' says seventh-ranked Svetlana Kuznetsova, 'showed there was possibility through tennis.' As playing careers go, however, Kournikova's is a case of sizzle beating steak, in straight sets.</p> <p>In assessing her record, Kournikova speaks with such candour and detachment that it's almost as if she is describing another person. 'In a perfect world, would I have won a tournament? Yes. But I wasn't able to string those matches together. Sometimes I got unlucky, and sometimes I just lost.' Regrets? 'Not a thing. Except to be a little stronger physically. Come on, regrets? I grew up a little girl in the Soviet Union playing at a small sports club. Tennis gave me my life.' Does she wish she had reined in the hype machine? 'It's hard. We did the best we could. But there was no blueprint.' And whatever you do, don't lavish her with a shred of sympathy. 'Hey, I took the money. It's simple. If you don't want the attention, don't take the money.'</p> <p>Tennis rivals boxing in the frequency of comebacks, so don't be surprised if Kournikova joins the ranks of the 'unretired'. She works out daily and this spring ran four miles in just under 29 minutes in a charity triathlon in Miami. Though her hands are noticeably free of calluses, she plays tennis a few times a week, sometimes on public courts not far from her waterfront home. In July she played in two matches for the St Louis Aces in the World Team Tennis league. 'Honestly, who knows?' she says. 'I'm young enough to still play. But physically could I take it?'</p> <p>She spends her days living what she admits is a charmed existence. Her parents, Alla and Sergei, divorced in 2004, but Alla moved to Palm Beach, remarried and has a three-year-old son, whose half-sister is all too happy to babysit. 'I get my kid fix,' she says. 'Then I say, \"Here ya go, Mom. See ya.\"' Kournikova is a spokesperson for sports shoe firm K-Swiss. She reads. When the urge strikes, she hits the South Beach clubs. And there are those Boys and Girls Club fundraisers. 'Don't get the wrong idea,' she says. 'I basically get dressed up and beg people for money.'</p> <p>She still has run-ins with the paparazzi, particularly when out with her longtime boyfriend, singer Enrique Iglesias. 'Girls look at him. Guys look at me,' she says. 'It goes with the job, but it gets annoying when you feel violated. Just take the picture and be done.' She can still watch celebrity shows and learn about herself. For the record: 'I'm not married, not pregnant, didn't have a boob job, no Botox. What else?'</p> <p>If it sounds as though she has figured life out, well, she hasn't. 'Here's one thing I don't get,' she says. 'Why are people afraid of getting older? You feel wiser. You feel more mature. You feel like you know yourself better. You would trade that for softer skin? Not me!' </p> <h2>AK-27 <br>A timeline</h2> <p><strong>1981</strong> Born in Moscow on 7 June.

  "<p>The future of Bradford &amp; Bingley is on a knife-edge this weekend, as frantic efforts are made to rescue the buy-to-let lender and prevent it from becoming the next victim of the credit crunch.</p> <p>The Treasury and the City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, are seeking a 'white knight' to stave off the possibility that the government will be forced to nationalise the bank in the same way that Northern Rock was put into public ownership in February. A well-placed source said that 'the priority, as with the Rock, will be to protect depositors'.</p> <p>But there is now a consensus that B&amp;B's days as an independent financial institution are coming to an end, with analysts saying that either a sale, possibly to a 'lifeboat' consortium of rival high street banks, or nationalisation, is the most likely outcome. A break-up sale is also a possibility, as is a combination with Northern Rock.</p> <p>Although the bank says it is well capitalised, the company is badly exposed to the sickly buy-to-let market and analysts say it may struggle to survive in the current global financial crisis. It was perceived to be 'clearing the decks' ahead of a sale last week when it announced it was shedding 370 jobs, writing off \u00a3134m of toxic assets and paying \u00a313m to rewrite the contract under which it had to take on buy-to-let mortgages from rival GMAC. But its share price continued to plunge, closing on Friday at 20p.</p> <p>Its five high-street banking rivals own 30 per cent of its shares, after they were forced to step in to underwrite its \u00a3400m rights issue, and it is believed that the FSA has already canvassed the support of HSBC, Barclays and Santander - which owns Abbey National and has just taken over Alliance &amp; Leicester - to support B&amp;B. While none of the three is likely to be keen to take on B&amp;B on its own, they may be prepared to take on parts of the bank under a break-up deal.</p> <p>B&amp;B has been under pressure since it launched the rights issue, just weeks after denying that it needed one. Since then, it has revealed mounting bad debts on its portfolio of buy-to-let mortgages - it is the second largest lender in this market - a slump in new lending and a series of asset write-offs. Last Thursday it said that it was removing mortgage advisers from all its branches so that all new inquiries would have to be dealt with at a central processing unit in Bingley.</p> <p>But the bank denied that meant it was effectively closed to new lending - only a tenth of its mortgages traditionally come from its branches, the remainder through intermediaries. It said that its branches would now concentrate on raising retail deposits. </p> <p>Bradford &amp; Bingley was formed in 1964 as a result of the merger of the Bradford Equitable building society and the Bingley Permanent building society. In 2000, it demutualised and floated on the London Stock Exchange with former members receiving shares of up to \u00a35,000 each.</p> <p>Many former building societies that abandoned mutual status have fared badly in the crunch: Santander took over Alliance &amp; Leicester, HBOS was forced into a merger with Lloyds TSB, and Northern Rock went bust.</p>",
  "<h2>Travelling hopefully</h2> <p>The financial world may be falling apart but people are still going on holiday, the bosses of package holiday operators Thomas Cook and Tui will tell investors this week. However, the downturn and high oil prices are squeezing the operators: winter bookings are forecast to be well down. Both Cook and Tui have indicated that together they could reduce capacity by at least 15 per cent next summer. But there is good news further ahead: the companies have recently made large acquisitions. Thomas Cook bought MyTravel and Tui acquired First Choice. Analysts have pencilled in cost savings from the deals of \u00a3150m apiece by 2010. The shares have hardly soared, but they have held up well against other consumer sectors such as gambling, pubs and retail.</p> <h2>Watch Saatchi trim the fat</h2> <p>Shares in M&amp;C Saatchi have been clobbered over the past year as the deteriorating economic outlook brings with it the prospect of a sharp fall in global advertising. But broker Numis Securities reckons the current share price, at around 100p, represents good value and that the market hasn't factored in scope for cost-cutting or evidence that management, led by David Kershaw, pictured, is adept at winning new business - witness his clinching of the Department of Health's anti-obesity campaign. Numis says buy up to 138p.</p> <h2>Man trapped in hedge</h2> <p>Man Group, the world's biggest listed hedge fund manager, wants the Financial Services Authority to protect it from short-sellers - rival hedge funds seeking to exploit the panic surrounding financial stocks. That may seem rich coming from a firm that has made millions shorting the shares of others, but the decline in its stock price has caught the attention of researchers at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods. They reckon the shares have been massively oversold at Friday's close of 374p and point out that dividend yield is 6.4 per cent and the company has excess capital of about $1.5bn. But it may need more than that to persuade the short-sellers to look elsewhere.</p>",
  "<p>The Scottish government is to take its case for an end to the dumping of dead fish at sea to the European Parliament this week.</p> <p>Richard Lochhead, Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, will tomorrow fly to Brussels to call for policies that do not force fishermen to throw marketable dead fish back into the sea.</p> <p>Following meetings with fishermen, scientists and conservationists last week, which highlighted the problem of more than 100,000 tonnes of wasted fish each year, the government is calling for the EU to follow Norway in banning the practice. </p> <p>Fishermen claim the North Sea cod quotas are at historically low levels and have not kept pace with the rise in fish numbers. Under EU rules, fishermen have to discard large amounts of fish or risk financial penalties if they land more than their quota.</p> <p>'The dumping of fish represents waste of a precious resource on a phenomenal scale,' said Richard Lochhead. 'Fishermen across the EU are being forced to discard marketable fish worth up to \u00a340m a year.'</p> <p>However, Liberal Democrat fisheries spokesperson Liam McArthur warned the Scottish government not to force the issue single-handedly.</p> <p>'The government must work with Westminster and the EU, as well as the Regional Advisory Councils, to address this issue,' he said.</p>",
  "<p>'Joe Kinnear? You're having a laugh.' In six gleefully delivered words sung during the first half Blackburn fans summed up the prevailing sentiment over Newcastle's temporary appointment of a man who last managed in 2004 when he left Nottingham Forest and has not operated in the Premier League for nine long years. And, it gets worse.</p> <p>The derision felt at Kinnear's almost surreal comeback to the big time was further increased during a bizarre post-match press conference with the new boss. It emerged that contrary to the club's official line, that he would not take charge until tomorrow, he is in fact serving a two-match ban from that last unsuccessful stab at management.</p> <p>'Yeah, it was around two years ago,' Kinnear said, somehow halving the amount of time he's spent away from the game.' I called the referee Coco the Clown - at Rotherham. I asked him what he did in his spare time.'</p> <p>Only Newcastle would employ a second caretaker boss - he replaces the hapless Chris Hughton - who may be out the door before he even makes it to the dugout, because not until the match against Manchester City in three weeks, will Kinnear be allowed to do so. That will make it 25 days since he was given the job and by then, of course, someone somewhere may have taken pity on the club by buying the damn thing.</p> <p>Had owner Mike Ashley and Dennis Wise, the executive director (football) known about the ban? 'No. I don't think so,' Kinnear said. 'I've got one game left. My contract is for six games.' Why six? 'Because the club might be sold after four games. It was a case of four or six games for the contract.'</p> <p>Had he picked the team for what was another disappointing outing and result? 'No. How could I? I only got here on Friday.' What about his relationship with Wise? 'There's been a lot misreported. The last time I spoke to Dennis Wise was two years ago.' And Ashley? 'I don't really know the guy that well.'</p> <p>After several different mentions of there being 'six or seven players missing, which has not helped matters', Kinnear was again honest about why he accepted a role turned down by Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle. 'I won't pussy foot around. I'm not stupid, I know whose footsteps I'm following,' he said of the lamented Kevin Keegan. 'And I know some people have said no. But more fool them. You never get a chance to manage a club like this.'</p> <p>How different, then, is the Premier League since he last managed in it during the 1998-99 season? 'Not much to be honest. There's still some good teams around.' Paul Ince, who confessed himself 'happy with the result but not the performance' from his Blackburn team, may well be building one himself.</p> <p>What he saw was an excellent first half before they faded but it was enough. After 31 minutes Carlos Villanueva floated in a swinging ball and Steven Taylor added to a miserable week - he apologised for the mistake that allowed a Spurs goal here on Wednesday - by failing to stop Christopher Samba getting across him. The big centre-half finished with a header. At the break it was two. Again, as Kinnear noted later, there was suspect defending. This time Argentine central defender Fabricio Coloccini could not deal with a cross from Brett Emerton and Roque Santa Cruz benefited with another header that beat Shay Given.</p> <p>Four minutes into the second half and Newcastle responded. Kinnear said he'd been in the changing room to tell his players 'to stop feeling sorry for themselves'. For a while it worked. Blackburn skipper Ryan Nelson apparently brought down Michael Owen in the area and Steve Tanner gave the penalty that the same player converted.</p> <p>This was the perfect start to the half from United but could they keep it up? The answer was yes, then no. Roared on by the crowd, Geremi - called 'Jeremiah' later by Kinnear - found himself inside the Blackburn area. All the former skipper had to do was control cleanly and there was time to attempt the equaliser. But, the ball fell off his foot and Hughton's fury in the technical area was very obvious.</p> <p>Then, the now former Newcastle manager had even more reason to be frustrated on 74 minutes. Charles N'Zogbia was hurtling with the ball at his feet towards goal when Nelson, who had been booked after the hour, seemed to clatter the French midfielder. Tanner, rather mysteriously, gave an emphatic 'no'. That was followed by an even more indignant expletive from Hughton. It might just become Newcastle United's adopted motto.</p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT<br></strong><br><strong>David Holmes, Observer reader<br></strong><br>Most of us feel this is some kind of purgatory until we reach the other side, where there may be green pastures. The team vindicate what Keegan said: there's no cover for injuries and we don't have Premier League standard players covering. Ashley is sticking with Xisco. He paid \u00a35.7m but the evidence so far is that he can't head the ball, he has no pace and no vision. The original Cisco kid had a fat companion and he would be better, he was that dreadful. Wise has no eye for a player and the defence is terrible. I'm going to see Status Quo tonight and one of their hits was 'Down Down Deeper and Down' - that's where we're going. Joe Kinnear seems like a nice guy but he's a prototype of Sam Allardyce who will play a long-ball game. People won't tolerate that.</p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> Given 5; Taylor 3, Coloccini 4, Ca\u00e7apa 3, Bassong 3; Geremi 4 (Ameobi 3), N'Zogbia 5 (Edgar 3), Butt 4, Duff 6; Owen 6, Xisco 2<br><strong><br>James Maguire, Observer reader</strong></p> <p>I'm delighted. Tugay was man of the match, while Olsson looked quite comfortable going forward and defensively. I didn't like Ince playing Derbyshire on the left and he kept on giving the ball away. I was glad Santa Cruz scored, but I think we should be playing two strikers, including Roberts. We are playing really nice football, better than under Hughes. I wasn't keen on Ince, but he's settled in and everyone seems confident. Fowler has surprised us, he had a really good first touch when he came on, but it will be hard for him when Benni McCarthy comes back.</p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> Brown 7; Simpson 7, Samba 8, Nelsen 7, Villanueva 6 (Fowler 7); Tugay 9, Warnock 7; Emerton 7, Derbyshire 6 (Ooijer 5), Olsson 8; Santa Cruz 7 (Roberts 5)<br><strong><br><em>To take part in the verdict, email<br>fans@observer.co.uk</em></strong></p>",
  "<p>Our gaze might be on the markets melting down, but the upheaval we are experiencing is more than a financial crisis, however large. Here is a historic geopolitical shift, in which the balance of power in the world is being altered irrevocably. The era of American global leadership, reaching back to the Second World War, is over.</p> <p>You can see it in the way America's dominion has slipped away in its own backyard, with Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez taunting and ridiculing the superpower with impunity. Yet the setback of America's standing at the global level is even more striking. With the nationalisation of crucial parts of the financial system, the American free-market creed has self-destructed while countries that retained overall control of markets have been vindicated. In a change as far-reaching in its implications as the fall of the Soviet Union, an entire model of government and the economy has collapsed.</p> <p>Ever since the end of the Cold War, successive American administrations have lectured other countries on the necessity of sound finance. Indonesia, Thailand, Argentina and several African states endured severe cuts in spending and deep recessions as the price of aid from the International Monetary Fund, which enforced the American orthodoxy. China in particular was hectored relentlessly on the weakness of its banking system. But China's success has been based on its consistent contempt for Western advice and it is not Chinese banks that are currently going bust. How symbolic yesterday that Chinese astronauts take a spacewalk while the US Treasury Secretary is on his knees.</p> <p>Despite incessantly urging other countries to adopt its way of doing business, America has always had one economic policy for itself and another for the rest of the world. Throughout the years in which the US was punishing countries that departed from fiscal prudence, it was borrowing on a colossal scale to finance tax cuts and fund its over-stretched military commitments. Now, with federal finances critically dependent on continuing large inflows of foreign capital, it will be the countries that spurned the American model of capitalism that will shape America's economic future.</p> <p>Which version of the bail out of American financial institutions cobbled up by Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke is finally adopted is less important than what the bail out means for America's position in the world. The populist rant about greedy banks that is being loudly ventilated in Congress is a distraction from the true causes of the crisis. The dire condition of America's financial markets is the result of American banks operating in a free-for-all environment that these same American legislators created. It is America's political class that, by embracing the dangerously simplistic ideology of deregulation, has responsibility for the present mess.</p> <p>In present circumstances, an unprecedented expansion of government is the only means of averting a market catastrophe. The consequence, however, will be that America will be even more starkly dependent on the world's new rising powers. The federal government is racking up even larger borrowings, which its creditors may rightly fear will never be repaid. It may well be tempted to inflate these debts away in a surge of inflation that would leave foreign investors with hefty losses. In these circumstances, will the governments of countries that buy large quantities of American bonds, China, the Gulf States and Russia, for example, be ready to continue supporting the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency? Or will these countries see this as an opportunity to tilt the balance of economic power further in their favour? Either way, the control of events is no longer in American hands.</p> <p>The fate of empires is very often sealed by the interaction of war and debt. That was true of the British Empire, whose finances deteriorated from the First World War onwards, and of the Soviet Union. Defeat in Afghanistan and the economic burden of trying to respond to Reagan's technically flawed but politically extremely effective Star Wars programme were vital factors in triggering the Soviet collapse. Despite its insistent exceptionalism, America is no different. The Iraq War and the credit bubble have fatally undermined America's economic primacy. The US will continue to be the world's largest economy for a while longer, but it will be the new rising powers that, once the crisis is over, buy up what remains intact in the wreckage of America's financial system. </p> <p>There has been a good deal of talk in recent weeks about imminent economic armageddon. In fact, this is far from being the end of capitalism. The frantic scrambling that is going on in Washington marks the passing of only one type of capitalism - the peculiar and highly unstable variety that has existed in America over the last 20 years. This experiment in financial laissez-faire has imploded.While the impact of the collapse will be felt everywhere, the market economies that resisted American-style deregulation will best weather the storm. Britain, which has turned itself into a gigantic hedge fund, but of a kind that lacks the ability to profit from a downturn, is likely to be especially badly hit.</p> <p>The irony of the post-Cold War period is that the fall of communism was followed by the rise of another utopian ideology. In American and Britain, and to a lesser extent other Western countries, a type of market fundamentalism became the guiding philosophy. The collapse of American power that is underway is the predictable upshot. Like the Soviet collapse, it will have large geopolitical repercussions. An enfeebled economy cannot support America's over-extended military commitments for much longer. Retrenchment is inevitable and it is unlikely to be gradual or well planned.</p> <p>Meltdowns on the scale we are seeing are not slow-motion events. They are swift and chaotic, with rapidly spreading side-effects. Consider Iraq. The success of the surge, which has been achieved by bribing the Sunnis, while acquiescing in ongoing ethnic cleansing, has produced a condition of relative peace in parts of the country. How long will this last, given that America's current level of expenditure on the war can no longer be sustained?</p> <p>An American retreat from Iraq will leave Iran the regional victor. How will Saudi Arabia respond? Will military action to forestall Iran acquiring nuclear weapons be less or more likely? China's rulers have so far been silent during the unfolding crisis. Will America's weakness embolden them to assert China's power or will China continue its cautious policy of 'peaceful rise'? At present, none of these questions can be answered with any confidence. What is evident is that power is leaking from the US at an accelerating rate. Georgia showed Russia redrawing the geopolitical map, with America an impotent spectator.</p> <p>Outside the US, most people have long accepted that the development of new economies that goes with globalisation will undermine America's central position in the world. They imagined that this would be a change in America's comparative standing, taking place incrementally over several decades or generations. Today, that looks an increasingly unrealistic assumption.</p> <p>Having created the conditions that produced history's biggest bubble, America's political leaders appear unable to grasp the magnitude of the dangers the country now faces. Mired in their rancorous culture wars and squabbling among themselves, they seem oblivious to the fact that American global leadership is fast ebbing away. A new world is coming into being almost unnoticed, where America is only one of several great powers, facing an uncertain future it can no longer shape.</p> <p>\u2022 John Gray is the author of Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia (Allen Lane)</p>",

People were almost tearfully astonished by its winning combination of sensuality, technology and availability. It seemed to predict the democratisation of pleasure that was the keynote address of the Sixties. The design drew on Jaguar's backlist of glorious shapes, most particularly Malcolm Sayer's D-Type - a successful racing car designed by men in brown coats, and a brilliant demonstration of the art and craft of penetration. A later Jaguar designer, Geoff Lawson, called it 'the optimum expression of steel'. Its phallic proportions amaze but are moderated by the sober and balanced composition; details have a feminine delicacy. The first production car in New York's Museum of Modern Art, it makes contemporary sculpture look ham-fisted. The E-Type is proof that cars can be sublime works of art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338018573\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2008/09/26/bentleyrtype.jpg\" alt=\"10 sexiest cars ever\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1952 Bentley R Type.

It is the quintessence of English handsomeness, but paradoxically - since it was built for the postwar export drive - it wasn't made for English customers and the architecture, oddly for something so absolutely English, owes much to contemporary Americana. The designer was John Blatchley, who learnt his trade at the traditional Gurney Nutting coachbuilders, where he became chief designer at the age of 23. His R-Type Continental has an aristocratic bearing, but is at the same time unostentatious and understated. Throughout the Fifties, the R-Type Continental was considered one of the most beautiful and desirable cars in the world, so when James Bond made his debut in the 1953 book Casino Royale, Ian Fleming had him in a fictional Bentley Mk IV. But the Continental was surely the car Fleming had in mind for literature's most famous modern Englishman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338018574\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2008/09/26/ferrari_daytona.jpg\" alt=\"10 sexiest cars ever\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1968 Ferrari Daytona.

A quarter of a century later, a Ferrari design language had been clearly established and the 365/GTB4, as it is correctly known, was its ultimate expression. The Daytona was named, with an eye to the American market, after a famous victory in the 24-hour race at the Daytona Speedway in Florida in 1967 when three Ferrari sports racers crossed the line abreast. This is not the purest Ferrari, but it is one of the most significant. It is a Ferrari conceived not as a racing car but as a luxury product, and it has styling to match. A few years later, the Ferrari factory withdrew from sports car racing and a vital creative source was lost. The Daytona was the last of its type.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338018575\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2008/09/26/corvette_53.jpg\" alt=\"10 sexiest cars ever\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1953 Chevrolet Corvette.

It was the first production car anywhere to have plastic body panels (although the chassis was resolutely old-regime steel). Chevrolet's parent, General Motors, had been the first manufacturer to understand the practicalities and psychology of colour when it began to exploit the new DuPont lacquers in the late Twenties. The first batch of Corvettes were all Polo white with Sportsman red vinyl interiors (the names are revealing of social ambitions). Styling was a shameless display of sexual suggestiveness: the soft red cockpit within a white body may have been unconscious, but was nonetheless dramatically effective. In 1960 the car was canonised by the Route 66 television show. It was America at its best, a product of the optimistic mid-Fifties when consumer dreams of the past came true. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338018576\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2008/09/26/AC_ace.jpg\" alt=\"10 sexiest cars ever\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1953 AC Ace.

Despite its bastard origins, mixed marriages, reckless flirtations and dubious encounters, the AC Ace mutated, by accident and design, into one of the most archetypal sports cars ever - rather as Jean Lorrain once said, a bad reputation never did anyone any harm. The original AC company was an antique survival of pioneer British vehicle manufacturing. Based in Thames Ditton, Surrey, it survived thanks to a contract to produce invalid carriages for the government. At least that was true until 1963 when a Texan chicken farmer and racing driver called Carroll Shelby had the happy idea of inserting a powerful American Ford '289' V8 into the unassuming AC Ace. He named it the Cobra. The engine had a transformational effect on the Ace's performance. Shelby then employed some of the graphic language of American hot-rodding to turn a well-mannered English sports car into a swollen phallus of visual aggression. Ride height was lowered and wheel arches enhanced snugly to accommodate dramatic dragster wheels. Scoops were enlarged, ducts added, chrome details judiciously employed. The Cobra influenced nothing, but was an exquisite example of itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338018724\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2008/09/26/lancia-b20.jpg\" alt=\"10 sexiest cars ever\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1951 Lancia Aurelia H20 GT.

They called it the Grand Tour. The type of car that later evolved to meet the needs of trans-European travel was called a Gran Turismo in deference to this tradition. Indeed, Anglophile associations with driving across France and Italy became so profound that the leading Milanese carrozzeria of the last century called itself Touring, since the English word conjured up notions of style and gentility that, at the time, the Italians felt were beyond their reach. The very first car to be called a GT was the Lancia Aurelia B20, a coup\u00e9 version of the 1951 Aurelia B10 saloon. The first cars were manufactured by Carrozzeria Viotti, but Pininfarina soon took over production. The Aurelia B20 GT was the very essence of bella figura and defined a lasting automobile type. It was a Lancia B20 which the elder Farina and his son Sergio used in 1951 to travel from Turin to Tortona to meet Enzo Ferrari for lunch. Each proud man had been reluctant to play host, but the lunch concluded in an agreement that thereafter Ferrari's image would be managed by the Farina family. The Lancia B20 may thus have been influential in one of the greatest aesthetic adventures of the industrial period. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338018725\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2008/09/26/porsche_356.jpg\" alt=\"10 sexiest cars ever\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1949 Porche 356.

To this remote spot, the Porsche Konstruktionsburo-f\u00fcr-Motoren-Fahrzeug-Luftfahrzeug-und-Wasserhahrzeugbau had removed itself after its wartime design consultancy that included the V-1 buzz-bomb and Porsche Typ 205, better known as the Maus tank. The Porsche 356 became a reality on 8 June 1948: a two-seater sports car of exceptional lightness and purity of concept. Using standard Volkswagen components, it was designed to achieve ideal performance/weight ratios and to offer minimal resistance to the air. The bonnet of this rear-engined car was not low-slung just for aerodynamic penetration: Porsche theory insisted that the driver should be in emotional contact with the road. In 1950 Porsche moved to a factory in Zuffenhausen, a Stuttgart suburb, and began production of the 'German' 356. The first production car was known as the Windhund (or Wind Hound) on account of its Irish wolfhound coloration. With this car Erwin Komenda developed an experimental technical prototype into a mature shape and in so doing created what has become the Porsche signature. Dr Porsche died in January 1951. American importer Max Hoffman told the younger Ferry Porsche: 'That design is absolutely impossible.' This absolutely impossible design eventually evolved into the Porsche 911, perhaps the greatest sports car ever made.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338018726\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2008/09/26/jaguar_xk120.jpg\" alt=\"10 sexiest cars ever\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1948 Jaguar XK120.

Perhaps the most perfectly complete expression of the English sports car, it is also a fairly complete expression of English genius in all its flawed, opportunistic, eccentric originality. The streamlined shape was a sensation when it appeared in the drab, rationed environment of the 1948 London Motor Show. At the time, Elizabeth David was researching her book Mediterranean Food, launched two years later into an England still eating beige soup and rissoles. The XK120 was an automotive expression of similar yearnings. Jaguar's presiding genius, Sir William Lyons, said the XK120 took just two weeks from concept to a full-sized mock-up. Artistically it is a satisfying combination of being apparently simple - a clear, unified, flowing form with no fussy effects - and also extremely subtle. No car body has ever made such voluptuous but disciplined use of curves. To build on the sensational consumer response, Jaguar did a well-publicised speed trial. On 30 May 1949, with Ron 'Soapy' Sutton at the wheel, a virtually standard XK120 reached a record speed of 132.6mph on a Belgian autoroute near Jabbeke, close to Ostend. Lyons observed the achievement of his beautiful car from a chartered Douglas DC-3 circling overhead. In California, taking a break from the movies, Clark Gable road-tested the car for the March 1950 edition of Road &amp; Track, announcing himself astonished. Humphrey Bogart was another signatory to the Jaguar cult. The original price of the XK120 was \u00a3998.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338018727\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2008/09/26/2109_mga.jpg\" alt=\"10 sexiest cars ever\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1955 Mga.

The spirit of MG is rooted in the mid-Twenties, when the Paris Exposition des Arts D\u00e9coratifs gave its name to cheerful, content-free modernisme. The letters stand for 'Morris Garages' and up to the mid-Fifties, MG produced uncomplicated two-seaters. The TC, TD and TF were the Old English Perpendicular of sports cars, and their charm, simplicity and quintessentially English pragmatism made them the basis of California's sports car cult - without MG there would never have been Corvettes or Thunderbirds. The MGA represented a dramatic break with tradition. It arose from Syd Enever's attempts to do an all-enveloping race-car body for the old sit-up-and-beg TD. It did not work out, so he started again. The MGA was shockingly radical for MG: its first car with a full-width body. Drawing with tact and restraint, the anonymous draughtsman was sure that he could achieve his effects through understatement and well-judged radii rather than showy flourishes. With intuitive aerodynamics, low aspect and modest details, it was outstandingly modern for its day (even if the components remained antique). The US advertisements said: 'Designed to steal your heart... There's promise of action in every line.' The MGA was the last admired product of the famous Oxfordshire company.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338018728\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2008/09/26/citroen_ds.jpg\" alt=\"10 sexiest cars ever\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1955 Citreon DS.

In a way, it was a product of what Curnonsky called 'la sainte alliance' between gastronomy and tourism. When Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn's prodigal creativity drove Citro\u00ebn into bankruptcy in 1934, the company was bought by the Michelin Tyre Company. Monsieur Bibendum was the device that encouraged motorists to travel to eat. We call the DS a Citro\u00ebn, but it might as well be a Bibendum. An advanced flat-six engine was planned for this car, but budget constraints meant it actually used the same one as the 1934 Traction Avant. But budget was the only constraint: in every other respect, the DS was the most extreme, advanced and accomplished car ever made. And the body was drawn by the same man, Flaminio Bertoni. In 1938 Pierre Boulanger had started a notebook dedicated to the voiture de grande diffusion. He said to his team, 'Study all the possibilities, including the impossible.' Boulanger was killed in 1950 while testing the car, but he had already refined the brief: 'The world's most beautiful, most comfortable and most advanced car, a masterpiece to show the world... that Citro\u00ebn and France could develop the ultimate vehicle.' Bertoni achieved the greatest-ever work of automobile art. 'D\u00e9esse' meant Goddess. First shown without wheels and tyres so as not to compromise the consumers' perception of its pure sculptural form, it was the car that inspired Roland Barthes. 'Smoothness,' he said, 'is always an attribute of perfection.'</p>",
  "<p>Wood pigeons, once a symbol of rural life in Britain, are being driven into urban gardens in a dramatic example of the changing face of the traditional landscape.</p> <p>Intensification of farming, which has made it harder for the pigeons to find wild food, and the boom in homeowners feeding birds, are being credited with the transformation of their habits. Indeed, Britain's biggest pigeon and dove species has now even usurped the 'national bird' - the robin - as one of the three most common garden birds.</p> <p>The results have been revealed in the latest garden birdwatch survey, done every year by 16,500 members of the British Trust for Ornithology. Robin numbers have stayed almost the same; it is the wood pigeons that have changed their habitat, said Paul Stancliffe, a member of the BTO's garden birdwatch team.</p> <p>'We're all seeing wood pigeons in gardens, even right in the heart of London,' said Stancliffe. 'Evolved behaviour takes a long time, but it's learned behaviour: once a bird finds a regular food source it will come back again and again because it knows the food will be there, so it doesn't have to forage.'</p> <p>Until the Seventies, wood pigeons were predominantly a farmland bird, commonly seen flocking around fields, especially in autumn, when harvesters had left seed scattered across the freshly cut stubble. But the move from one to two crops a year, and more efficient reaping equipment, mean less cereal left behind, while at the same time Britons now spend an estimated \u00a3200m a year buying 46,000 tonnes of bird food to put out in their gardens.</p> <p>Another factor is modern birdseed mixes: cheaper brands with more cereal attract wood pigeons, while those richer in seeds are favoured by smaller birds such as chaffinches and greenfinches. Flat bird tables are also easier for wood pigeons to eat from, but hanging feeders make it harder.</p> <p>When the BTO's survey began in 1995, wood pigeons were the 11th most common bird; this year they have risen to number three, behind blackbirds and blue tits, but ahead of robins at number four. Others in the top 10 are: dunnocks, great tits, collared doves, chaffinches, house sparrows and greenfinches. </p> <p>'It might seem that you have little choice when it comes to them using your garden; this isn't quite true,' added Stancliffe. 'Wood pigeons come in search of seed and have a real preference for the type of seed mixes that are put out.'</p> <p>The results of another, more recent, change to British farming - the abolition of payments to farmers to 'set aside' land, which once discouraged over-production and helped create wildlife-friendly areas - also emerged last week. The Wildlife Trusts said half of all set-aside land - an area the size of Nottinghamshire - had been put back into production and warned of a devastating impact on wildlife, including farmland birds, which have seen dramatic declines since the introduction of intensive farming methods and the greater use of agricultural chemicals since the Sixties.</p> <p>However, the BTO said there was evidence that replacement agri-environment schemes were helping one of the most affected birds, lapwings, whose numbers have nearly halved since 1970. </p> <p>A pilot survey by the BTO of 'fallow' areas found nearly four out of 10 were visited by lapwings and one in four showed signs of breeding. Those away from cover of trees and hedgerows were especially popular. </p> <p>'By creating the right kind of plot in the best possible position within the field, the lapwing occupancy rate could be increased significantly, helping to reverse the declining numbers of this iconic farmland bird,' said Dan Chamberlain, a BTO research ecologist.</p> <h2>Top 10 birds</h2> <p>1 Blackbird</p> <p>2 Blue tit</p> <p>3 Wood pigeon</p> <p>4 Robin</p> <p>5 Dunnock</p> <p>6 Great tit</p> <p>7 Collared dove</p> <p>8 Chaffinch</p> <p>9 House sparrow</p> <p>10 Greenfinch</p>",
  "<p>'I'm really worried for my mother. She has \u00a325,000 in Isas and her life savings with Bradford &amp; Bingley.'</p> <p>Alexander Lawrence, 22, a student from Bristol, is one of the millions of people whose family finances are tied up with the fate of the former building society. 'I had to call her this morning to tell her the bad news because she is on holiday in Italy at the moment. She's worried and will have to sort it out when she gets back.'</p> <p>Last night the government was considering the possibility of a temporary nationalisation of B&amp;B after talks to agree a last-minute rescue deal with the Spanish bank Santander stalled. An announcement is expected later today on whether the final decision to nationalise has been taken. </p> <p>The government had been in discussions with Santander for more than a week before rescue talks reached a deadlock last night. It seems the Spanish bank is loath to acquire B&amp;B's so-called 'toxic' assets without some government assurances. As a deal could not be reached, temporary nationalisation was mooted as a solution to give Santander more time to come to a decision. </p> <p>The government still hopes Santander will buy B&amp;B, but another solution could be to carve it up between Santander and HSBC. The Treasury has admitted, however, that if a commercial solution cannot be agreed upon, B&amp;B could remain in government control for some time - posing a considerable financial and political risk to the government. </p> <p>Santander's presence on the British high street is growing: it already owns Abbey and is buying Alliance &amp; Leicester, and consolidation is proceeding apace in the troubled global banking sector. Whatever happens now, more than 150 years of independent history for a proud Yorkshire company will be at an end within hours.</p> <p>One solution that had been put forward during the talks earlier yesterday by B&amp;B's adviser, Goldman Sachs, was for the bank's toxic mortgage loans to be parcelled together with those of Northern Rock to create a government-owned 'bad bank'. That would free the Rock's 'good' loans to be sold to Santander or another bidder, and combined with B&amp;B's high-quality mortgages. </p> <p>Santander, which controls around 12 per cent of the UK mortgage market, is keen to expand but only wants to buy B&amp;B if it can obtain some government assurances to limit the potential losses it might be taking on. Arrears on B&amp;B's book of mortgages are currently running at double the industry average.</p> <p>News of B&amp;B's imminent downfall prompted some anxious investors to remove their cash, though on nothing like the scale of the chaotic scenes that followed rumours Northern Rock was about to collapse just over a year ago. </p> <p>The bank admitted people had been withdrawing money on the internet this weekend and said there were small queues of savers at a handful of its 200 branches, but added that staff had volunteered to give up their weekends to make sure customers could all get their money out straight away. 'The hard work and loyalty of our staff has been fantastic - I am very proud of them,' said B&amp;B chief executive Richard Pym. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the commitment of the bank's tellers has not been enough to save B&amp;B from a fate brought about by its former senior managers. They transformed it from a traditional building society into a specialist lender that bet heavily on buy-to-let loans and self-certification mortgages, where borrowers did not have to supply any evidence of their earnings.</p> <p>And like Northern Rock, B&amp;B relied heavily on the wholesale credit markets for its funding - and they have now seized up in the credit crunch. </p> <p>'With Northern Rock people didn't believe that their savings were safe; [this time] they do, which has prevented a run on B&amp;B. But it still has a problem, because it can't renew its funding on the wholesale markets,' said Ray Boulger of John Charcol.</p> <p>B&amp;B is the latest British casualty of the sub-prime crisis, which has spread across the world from the trailer parks of the US. Gordon Brown returned from Washington early yesterday morning, where he had been meeting President Bush for talks on the plan to bail out US banks, and went straight to Number 10 to join the B&amp;B rescue attempt. Chancellor Alistair Darling is also spending the weekend in Downing Street. They are in constant contact with officials from the Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog that is desperate to avert another run on a major bank. </p> <p>The fact that the country's sixth largest mortgage lender is teetering on the edge of collapse is likely to cost homeowners a great deal, regardless of the ultimate outcome. A takeover by Santander would reduce competition in the loans market, where the number of major players has already shrunk after the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB last week, creating a giant lender controlling more than 20 per cent of the market. </p> <p>Uncertainty in the financial markets has pushed the rate at which banks lend to each other to its highest level for 16 years, and the increased cost of borrowing is being passed on to customers. HSBC, First Direct, Woolwich and the Yorkshire building society all put up their fixed-rate mortgages last week. </p> <p>'Clearly the B&amp;B situation is not helpful,' said Boulger. 'It has been cutting back on its lending for some months so the supply of loans will not reduce by much. But it is terrible for sentiment. We will see more lenders put their rates up a quarter point or so, though hopefully not on a horrific scale. The worse the situation gets, the sooner the Bank of England will have to cut base rates.'</p> <p>B&amp;B's demise is also a dark omen for the troubled buy-to-let market. Buy-to-let loans, as the government is acutely aware, are crucial to the fortunes of the housing market. If landlords rush to sell their properties, they could swamp the market and send prices plunging even faster. Financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown recently warned that as many as 200,000 of the buy-to-let mortgages taken out last year could be in negative equity and that 10,000 people have already run up arrears.</p> <p>Around 85 per cent of B&amp;B's \u00a341bn loan book is made up of mortgages granted to amateur landlords or self-certificators. It has 15 per cent of the total buy-to-let mortgage sector, which has mushroomed to \u00a3132.5bn in the past 10 years. More than a million people owe money on buy-to-let mortgages.</p> <p>'Most buy-to-let investors coming to the end of their initial mortgage deals have been having difficulty getting another one,' said Boulger. 'If people have taken out large loans on city-centre flats that have fallen in value, they will have trouble.'</p> <p>B&amp;B has two-and-a-half million savers and the bank stressed this weekend that their cash is secure, with deposits of up to \u00a335,000 covered by the government-backed protection scheme. But whether it is bought or nationalised, there are likely to be heavy job losses among the company's 3,000 staff, on top of the 370 employees it axed last week.</p> <p>That will add to the gloom in the financial services industry, which has already seen redundancies at Northern Rock and Lehman Brothers and is expecting more at HBOS. International bank HSBC axed 1,100 jobs worldwide and 500 in the UK last week. Bankers said there are likely to be more bank failures or rescue mergers. Concerns centre around smaller building societies and other buy-to-let mortgage specialists such as Paragon.</p> <p>B&amp;B's demise will remove the last former building society from the stock market - an ignominious end to the brave new world the lenders claimed to be ushering in when they floated their shares, offering cash windfalls that turned out to cost their customers very dearly indeed.</p>",
  "<p>It is, of course, alchemy, all of it, nothing but damned alchemy. They're modern necromancers, the whole of the film-making industry, and the business of how on earth anything gets made, or works (or, equally entertainingly, fails) has filled many fascinating books. And one of the fascinating things about alchemy is the injection of time to the equation: because elements settle, and alter, and morph; and, today, after a quarter of a century or whatever, we can see what remained lead, and what became gold.</p> <p>It was exactly 25 years ago when Bill Forsyth made Local Hero. It's still regularly hailed as one of the quiet must-see little masterpieces of British cinema: I can think of few friends, of all ages and backgrounds, without a copy nestling happily on some shelf, brought out on cold nights. The marvel is that it has lasted so tremendously well. It is, in some ways, of its time. A nefarious American oil company sends a yuppie ingenu to Scotland to buy a beach. He meets sturdy, feisty locals, falls in love, sees the Northern Lights, changes his mind about the oil business. In one late-ish crucial scene we see his pager, black and American and Eighties and very bleepy, burbling itself to death in a rock-pool. Back in his Houston loft, with his absurd trappings, he can think only of the locals, the lights, the beach, the pub, the phone box. Which he calls.</p> <p>As, apparently, have hundreds, thousands of tourists down the years. Pennan in Aberdeenshire, where half the film was shot, still has, or at least did on my last visit, admittedly a few years ago, the same phone box. The guys in the bar opposite were getting a bit fed up, called out nightly through the rain to the ringing box, to chat to some Japanese couple who had taken its number on their trip, and wanted the same sense of phone contact with which the film ends. It is huge physical testament, if infuriating for the crofter wanting a quiet dram, to the global appeal, perennial success, of a home-funded, home-made Scottish Eighties film. </p> <p>Yes, Burt Lancaster was on board. Producer David Puttnam says now it couldn't really have happened without that: despite the genius of Forsyth - a rising star after Gregory's Girl - they still needed a big Hollywood name. </p> <p>Yes, Mark Knopfler did the music (and Dire Straits were the band of the moment, the soundtrack going on to outsell video sales of the film itself). But. But. There had to be something else. What's made this last, when so much other celluloid from those days should have been dumped straight back into the alchemist's chalice?</p> <p>'It's probably the deficiences in it,' says Forsyth, now 60, speaking from his home near Loch Lomond. 'I don't think it was a manipulative film. If I'd known how to, at the time, I could have made it more manipulative. I'm not trying to be coy, but I've never had a great understanding for commercial cinema. A film-maker with more nous would have been more manipulative.</p> <p>'I hesitate to use the word \"innocence\" about it, because the characters have attitude, have stories, have views, I don't think it was too innocent a film. But if there was a layer of purpose or intent missing, a layer of manipulation - here's where we want the audience to feel this, or that, I've always truly hated that - then, perhaps, that's been its secret, if you like.'</p> <p>Forsyth says he hasn't watched it for about 20 years. 'I don't really do that. I'll see mistakes!' One, he admits, was completely his own, fortunately over-ridden. 'Looking back, you'd hardly credit it, but I didn't want music. I was a bit of an egghead about film: I was of this puritan streak that if you had to put music in it then you had, somehow, failed. I am proud to admit I was very, very wrong. Mark's [Knopfler] music helped make the film and I am very, very grateful to him. Plus, it wasn't one of those deals you often get with the composer, where the first inkling they get of the film is after it's made, in some grotty studio in Soho. Mark, because we'd wanted him to be involved with the ceilidh music - he wrote all of it, in the end - was on set, around, getting the feel, talking to the locals, picking up the atmosphere.</p> <p>'I really was quite naive. Then. Probably still am. I couldn't, for instance, see how the settings could mesh. I'd just written down - I wanted the village here, the beach there, the church there. The place, such a place, couldn't be found. I was very confused when the location guys said, fine, let's shoot the village on one side of Scotland, the beach on the west. I couldn't get my head around it. And, of course, it worked. I remember settling on Pennan, on the very last day I could: I had a gun to my head, and had to make the phone call by five that day to confirm. I made the phone call, just before five. Yes, from that blooming phone box.'</p> <p>According to Puttnam, 'One of the reasons it all worked, still works, is because it was a very honest film. It didn't pretend the villagers didn't want to sell up. It has classic elements of absolute chaos, back to the kind of writing of Victorian times - Trollope, Pooter. Although it was, yes, telling a story from its time, there were certain classic elements. The wise old man on the beach is a staple, down centuries.</p> <p>'Also, perhaps it's lasted because the very experience of making it was so enjoyable. It was as if we'd all gone on holiday and someone had remembered to bring a camera. Looking back, too, it was probably the first mainstream entertaining film that ever questioned the complexity of ecology.'</p> <p>Bill Forsyth is immensely grateful still to Puttnam and co - do you remember those heady days of 'The British are coming!' - for the 'luxury, very rare in those days, of being paid. I got paid to write it. Because Puttnam had got involved, we knew that a) we had funding, and b) it was, come what may, going to be released. That was unusual. Very.</p> <p>'But I think some of them maybe had more fun making it than me. I had, all the time, rewrites. Something up with the cast, or a location: rewriting 24 hours a day. That's what you have to do. Yes, the others had a good time, I do think. Immersed themselves. There were... romances.</p> <p>'You know, I haven't actually watched it for about 20 years myself. It is a surprise, a delight, that people still like it. Local Hero never did massive business. It was well received, but it never made a pile, it wasn't in the year's top 10 films or anything. It washed its face, modestly. I think there's still some kind of financial record associated with Gregory's Girl. We made it for \u00a3200,000. Less, in fact. We had a great accountant, we actually handed \u00a38,000 back to the investors! So when that goes on to make five million or whatever - but these were different, different times.</p> <p>'Yes, you probably could still make Local Hero today, but I don't actually know who'd want to. Young film-makers today, they seem to have too much pressure on them to arrive with a film, their second or third or whatever, to make a big publicity statement. Rather than just, you know, make a film. With Local Hero, we were lucky with the funding, with the time it gave me to write: but we were slackers! We were stumbling into the limelight!</p> <p>'Also, I don't want you to think there was some deliberate message. You talk about the plot, but was there one? I mean, people can look back and say, oh, this was all an early one about the environment or whatever, but it didn't happen that way, or if it did it was accidental. I'm not political, either in film or personally, and I don't really do plot, and certainly don't aim to broadcast a \"message\". I suppose I like to tell stories. And if I'm writing a film, and don't really have a plot, then you have to fill the screen with something, so I try to do so with characters, incidents. The aurora borealis, for instance: I hadn't had any plans about that, but that year I was writing Local Hero I found myself up in Orkney, doing a short film for the BBC with Cyril Cusack, and I saw the aurora one night, first time ever, on the beach. So: that went in. It was all a bit like that.'</p> <p>Forsyth is still involved with films, collaborating this winter with his friend, producer Iain Smith, on something 'supernatural, cold, stark'. Age has, he says, brought him something: if not wisdom, then a smidgen more self-knowledge. 'To have, at this age, the realisation that maybe I got some things wrong is quite nice, in a way. The main problem is I think I was too full of irony, that laid-back irony. Watching from the wings. It's a very Scottish thing, holding up the kitchen wall at parties, casting comment from the sidelines. Hiding in the wings. I don't know, after all these years, whether that really was the way to have gone. Maybe I've found out in time. Maybe I'll have some time to fix that, get things more right.'</p> <h2>Where the stars are now</h2> <p><strong>Burt Lancaster </strong>(Felix Happer): Film projects included thriller The Osterman Weekend (1983) and<strong> </strong>Field of Dreams (1989).

  "<h2>No</h2> <p><strong>Leo Hickman, journalist and ethical living adviser</strong></p> <p>When you jump off that chair lift for the first time every season, fill your lungs with frigid air and glance at that mountain vista ahead, it's hard not to feel a connection with nature. Immersing yourself in this environment is arguably one of skiing's key attractions. </p> <p>But strip away the glamour and the thrills and you are left with a list of environmental woes. And that's not taking into account the fact that the busiest slope in any ski region is the line of aircraft descending to the airport. You cannot talk about skiing without mentioning climate change. Skiers, of all people, should be aware of the rapid changes occurring on the world's mountain ranges. Glaciers are in speedy retreat and snow lines are rising quickly. </p> <p>Skiers are not directly causing these problems, other than by being members of the human race. But the skiing industry is frantically, forlornly, trying to stave off the deleterious effects of climate change with a series of measures that will only exacerbate the problem in the long run. The arrival of snow cannons at virtually every major resort over the past decade is the most worrying of trends. Working through the night as the skiers' attention turns to the delights of schnapps and fondue, these spray particles of water mixed with nucleating agents into the freezing air to create a blanket of artificial snow. A lack of the real stuff has forced the industry to rely on these machines, but their environmental impact is considerable.</p> <p>Mountain Wilderness, a French conservation group that described skiing as 'the cancer of the Alps', says that 4,000 cubic metres of water are needed to cover one hectare of piste for a season - whereas a hectare of corn needs only 1,700. Across the Alps, it is estimated that artificial snow consumes the same amount of water each year as 1.5 million people. Incredibly, in some regions, tap water is used, but elsewhere river water is extracted from the valleys below and pumped back up the mountain. </p> <p>This causes two problems. First, there is the energy expenditure: Mountain Wilderness says that it requires about 25,000 kilowatt-hours, costing about \u20ac150,000, to cover just one hectare of piste with snow for a season (that's largely why the cost of ski passes has risen so much in recent years). Second, dumping river water at high altitude disrupts biodiversity because it introduces nutrients in the water into an area where they wouldn't otherwise be. </p> <p>Using artificial snow also means that the pistes now take up to a month longer than normal to melt in the summer, preventing many plant species lying dormant underneath from germinating and flowering, leading to huge muddy scars in the summer meadows where the pistes once lay. Just take a look on Google Earth at satellite images of, say, the Chamonix valley or Aspen during the summer months.</p> <p>'Artificial snow is not the root of all evil, but it is very close,' says Sergio Savoia, the programme director of WWF Switzerland. 'One of the biggest problems is psychological: snow cannons give tourists the idea that it is business as usual. But we don't actually have much snow.'</p> <p>Some low-lying resorts are experiencing winter nights that are too warm even to use snow cannons. There are reports that helicopters are being used to ferry snow to threadbare pistes in order to keep these resorts in business. In 2002, Italian police set up a task force to investigate the 'theft' of snow from glaciers by the truck load in order to serve nearby resorts. The alternative is to abandon such resorts and chase the snow, by building new lifts and hotels further up the mountain. This is already being seen in some places. </p> <p>But, despite the promises of resort owners, how environmentally sensitive can a concrete mixer really be when taken high up into a wilderness area and put to work?</p> <p>\u2022 Leo Hickman is the author of The Final Call: Investigating Who Really Pays for Our Holidays (Transworld)</p> <h2>Yes</h2> <p><strong>Veronica Tonge, responsible travel consultant</strong></p> <p>Many people take the view that the downhill ski industry ruins the environment, consumes vast amounts of energy and cannot possibly be in harmony with the principles of responsible or sustainable tourism. However, it has been the saviour of many mountain communities and traditions, halting the depopulation and poverty that occurred at the end of the 19th century.</p> <p>It requires positive action, however, for a sport such as skiing, with its requirement for lifts, pistes and artificial snow, to operate on a green basis. </p> <p>Ski lifts and artificial snow-making do require power for the ski season; but they are increasingly efficient and clean since they no longer run on diesel and the electricity can come from renewable sources. Many resorts in Europe derive nearly all their power from hydroelectricity and, in America, Vail Resorts became one of the world's largest corporate users of renewable energy when it switched its five resorts and offices to use wind power.</p> <p>Lech in Austria has reduced its CO2 emissions further and improved air quality by building a biomass plant to provide heat and hot water to the resort and by providing a free public bus service to remove the need for cars. Therefore, staying for a week there could result in negligible emissions. </p> <p>So what about the chemicals in the artificial snow and the vast quantities of water it requires? Resorts have used proteins to help the artificial snow freeze at higher temperatures; however, studies have been inconclusive on the impacts. Nonetheless, some resorts have never used them, such as those in the Austrian Tyrol where the artificial snow is made from pure water - evidenced by the certified organic pastures underneath. The water is either taken from rivers or reservoirs built to store rainwater up the mountain. In Austria, the reservoirs have to undergo environmental impact assessments before construction and often end up blending so harmoniously that summer walks are routed to them. The rivers are assessed to work out the exact amount of water that can be safely taken out without damage to the wildlife and this water is even filtered to ensure that it is pure. </p> <p>And what about the delayed snowmelt? We have all seen mountains where the only snow remaining is that of the piste of artificial snow. Repeated scientific studies have found no negative impacts of artificial snow or delayed snowmelt on vegetation and, in the same way a plastic bag protects your favourite garden plants from spring frosts, artificial snow has been found to operate in the same way for the Alpine vegetation.</p> <p>Pistes are the other requirement for skiing. Although some have been created by bulldozing the mountain, there is a new technique called the 'soil push' method, whereby the topsoil and vegetation is removed as 'turf', the land is machine-graded underneath and then the topsoil is re-laid, which effectively keeps all the plant and insect diversity intact as before. Some resorts are reducing the need for prepared pistes altogether by reclassifying advanced runs as 'itinerary' routes which are not prepared or groomed, providing exciting challenges for experienced skiers.</p> <p>So can you ski and keep your green conscience clear? Yes, but only if you select your resort carefully. Check websites such as the Ski Club of Great Britain (<a href=\"http://www.skiclub.co.uk\">skiclub.co.uk</a>) and Save our Snow (<a href=\"http://www.saveoursnow.com\">saveoursnow.com</a>) for lists of resorts that are taking positive environmental steps, but do your own research, too, by checking out the resort's own websites. They are increasingly realising that green credentials can win them more visitors. Choose the right resort and your conscience can be as clear as the mountain air.</p> <p>\u2022 Veronica Tonge is the author of several reports analysing the impacts of skiing</p> <h2>Resorts with a green stamp</h2> <p><strong>Aspen, Colorado</strong><br>Aspen has a stingent green building policy, with projects such as the Snowmass Golf Clubhouse, which is one of the most energy-efficient commercial buildings in the state.

  "<p>You could call it Revenge of the Ninjas. While European and US banks have spent the past two decades piling on the leverage and stacking up the loans, their Japanese counterparts were stuck in the slow lane, repairing their balance sheets and restricting their lending.</p> <p>That conservatism has left them ideally placed to take advantage of the credit-crunch carnage - and they are already snapping up the bargains. Last week alone, Japan's biggest investment banking group, Nomura, grabbed Lehman's Asian and European investment banking businesses from under the nose of Barclays, which had hoped to add these two to its purchase of the failed bank's US arm. Mitsubishi UFJ, the country's biggest bank, is spending up to $8.5bn (\u00a34.6bn) on a 20 per cent stake in Morgan Stanley and there has been speculation that Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group is to invest $2bn in Goldman Sachs. </p> <p>That follows deals like Tokio Marine's $4.7bn purchase of insurance group Philadelphia Consolidated, Mizuho Corporate Bank's 130bn yen (\u00a3663m) stake in Merrill Lynch and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation's 106bn yen investment in our own Barclays.</p> <p>Simon Somerville, manager of Jupiter's Japan Income fund, thinks there will be more such deals. 'Japan Inc, not just the banks, has been very cautious. [The banks] have very strong balance sheets and are not leveraged and they have been criticised for it. Now they are taking advantage of distressed sellers and picking up some trophy assets.'</p> <p>And at bargain prices: Nomura paid just $225m for Lehman's Asia Pacific business, and while it has not disclosed the price it paid for the European arm, it is unlikely to have been significantly more. A year ago, a 20 per cent stake in Morgan Stanley would have cost Mitsubishi three times as much. </p> <p>It is not the first time that Japanese banks have made concerted forays overseas. Two decades ago, they ranked among the biggest in the world and were snapping up foreign investment banks along with assets like the Rockefeller Centre in New York and Universal Studios. These were funded by the huge profits generated on their domestic property assets - profits that evaporated as that market collapsed, leaving the banks stuck with a welter of bad loans and enmeshed in a web of shareholdings in Japanese industry. </p> <p>The country and its banks are only just emerging from the banking failures, rescues and write-offs that followed: between 1990 and 2004, Japanese financial institutions wrote off more than 125 trillion yen, according to Kristine Li at KBC Securities Japan - more than the $500bn or so estimated losses from the current credit crunch. They face yet more write-offs on the Lehman collapse: Japanese banks are among the most vulnerable to the failed US bank, with a collective exposure of 320bn yen, but because their balance sheets are far less highly leveraged than European rivals - Barclays and Deutsche Bank, for example, have loans of 50 times their assets - the pain of writing this off will not be too severe.</p> <p>For Somerville, the biggest surprise is that the Chinese, who are also flush with cash and have steered clear of the sub-prime crisis, have not joined the Japanese in their spending spree. That, he says, may reflect the huge opportunities in their domestic market, in contrast to the Japanese: 'Possibly they are also not ready for that kind of expansion,' he suggests.</p> <p>Japanese banks certainly are. The authorities in Tokyo, having funded years of rescues, have been adept at deflating any new bubbles that threatened to emerge - last year, banks were encouraged to restrict their property lending after a steep rise in prices. </p> <p>But, as Li observes in an analyst's note, 'the problem for the banking industry is that it is very difficult to earn money in a business environment that does not have bubbles of some form or another.' </p> <p>The Japanese banking market is very mature, and serves an ageing population, so there is little growth in the home market. 'Without these bubbles, Japanese banks can barely have any earnings growth,' adds Li. </p> <p>The key question is whether the Japanese will be able to manage this wave of expansion better than the last. Previous forays into investment banking have met with little success because Japanese management has been reluctant to cede any power to the buccaneering executives in these divisions and hesitant to pay the kind of salaries that the 'bulge bracket' has - at least hitherto - demanded.</p> <p>The fact that Nomura has earmarked $1bn to create a bonus pool for the European and Middle East operations it is taking on suggests it now appreciates the need to be generous - although with job losses, rather than year-end bonuses, on most bankers' minds, Oriental thrift may not seem out of place. </p> <p>'Over the last 20 years, Nomura has not punched its weight in international markets. It has tried to build businesses in international markets with varying degrees of success,' says Sadeq Sayeed, a special adviser to the bank. 'We have been looking for opportunities outside Japan for some time... We have shown that speed is a characteristic we relish and change is something we are not afraid of.'</p>",
  "<p>It was the week that an angry Main Street finally fought back after a decade when the financial masters of Wall Street were seemingly invincible. As President George Bush looked straight into the television cameras last week and spelt out to the nation the economic peril facing America, the fury and fear were mounting in millions of homes.</p> <p>'Without immediate action by Congress, America could slip into a financial panic,' Bush warned. He sketched out a scenario of failing banks and plunging share prices which would savage retirement plans and put millions out of work. It was a terrifying scenario. Having waged two wars that are not yet over, Bush faced the final legacy of his tumultuous two-term period in office: the possible collapse of the American economy.</p> <p>But the action he was calling for stuck in the throats of the American people. The administration's planned $700bn bail-out for the financial sector has outraged and appalled many on the country's Main Streets. It has led to anger on the left of American politics, shocked at such aid to wealthy bankers when the millions of families losing their homes get little direct help. At the same time many on the right have expressed equal disbelief, watching in amazement as the previously free-marketeer Bush suddenly embarked on the biggest government intervention since the Great Depression.</p> <p>The US media have turned on Wall Street like a pack of wolves. 'Fraud Street,' screamed the banner scrolling beneath the concerned features of Fox Business Network's Liz Claman, who told viewers: 'You know what? I think the American public deserves some answers.' Time magazine declared that the nation's current troubles were 'the price of greed'. 'Blame greed,' echoed the Chicago Tribune</p> <p>At the United Nations, an Australian reporter accosted the actor Michael Douglas during a press conference and demanded to know - with a straight face, mind you - whether he felt any responsibility for the crisis because he delivered the line 'greed is good' as the character Gordon Gekko in the film Wall Street. 'Are you now saying, Gordon, that greed is not good?' the reporter asked. </p> <p>'I'm not saying that,' a bemused Douglas replied. 'And my name is not Gordon. He's a character I played 20 years ago.'</p> <p>The huge bail-out plan has also fundamentally changed the battlefield of the American election, which is just five weeks away from deciding who will be the next president. The sheer scale of the economic crisis, and the enormous sums of taxpayers' money demanded to sort it out, are the biggest game in town.</p> <p>In the UK, the red mists of anger have been slower to appear but the frustration is emerging with millions of savers and shareholders in Bradford and Bingley recognising that it will become the latest high street bank to fall victim to the financial contagion that has its roots in sub-prime lending to poor American homebuyers. Gordon Brown, who had been in Washington conferring with Bush about the crisis, branded the past few years an 'age of irresponsibility' and demanded the banks stop behaving recklessly. Until recently, Brown and his Chancellor, Alistair Darling, had been boasting that the past decade was an era of unprecedented prosperity and stability, and the Prime Minister's volte-face drew immediate accusations of hypocrisy from the Conservatives.</p> <p>As the deadlock on Capitol Hill continued last week, it must have been painfully obvious to Brown that the consequences of failure would reverberate throughout the world financial system - and straight to the pockets of Britain's homeowners. The cost of interbank lending on the London money markets has shot up, as shocked investors feared more banks could be at risk of going bust. Mortgage rates in the UK quickly followed, leaving thousands of homeowners struggling to find affordable finance. </p> <p>Here in Britain, analysts believe the impact of the financial crisis on the real economy has only just begun to bite. But to millions of Americans, it seems as though the doomsday picture is already upon them, especially in crucial battleground states such as Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, America's former manufacturing heartland.</p> <p>These are people like Ken Karasek. The 47-year-old union organiser in the city of Wilkes-Barre has lived all his life among the hardscrabble towns of eastern Pennsylvania. He has seen factory after factory close and jobs move overseas. He feels that the economic crisis of the past year has merely brought the rest of America up to speed with what has happened in his home patch for the past three decades, and he is angry that the government has been so quick to bail out Wall Street with hundreds of billions. 'It disgusts me. I have seen huge plants close down all over this area. I have seen good union jobs go and get replaced by service jobs, like McDonalds or Wendy's. Now we give all this money to Wall Street just like that?' he protested.</p> <p>The panic around the economy has infected the political system, upending traditional alliances, pushing Democrats closer to Bush's plan and Republicans further away. It has created ructions in the race between Barack Obama and John McCain, seeing a dangerous game of political brinksmanship that ended with McCain suspending his campaign and rushing back to Washington.</p> <p>The events which led to that astonishing twist began at 8.30am on Wednesday. Obama had placed the call to McCain, reaching out with the idea that the two rival candidates could draft a common statement on the financial crisis gripping America. Such a move was far from altruistic. A Washington Post poll that morning showed Obama opening up a nine-point lead in the race. The poll was perhaps the strongest sign that voters were beginning to decisively break for the Democrats. By reaching out to McCain across party divides, Obama could stamp his ownership on the economic issue and also appear as a unifying president-in-waiting.</p> <p>McCain finally returned the call at 2.30pm that afternoon. The two men agreed in principle to a joint statement and McCain mentioned he was thinking of returning to Washington to address the crisis. He also suggested suspending Friday night's first televised presidential debate. Obama, apparently, assumed McCain was not serious - but he misjudged his opponent. A few minutes later, McCain called a press conference, suspended his campaign and said he was heading back to the capital. </p> <p>It was a high-stakes move, dictated by political needs of the moment. It showed leadership and his maverick streak that is always popular with swing voters, as McCain also struck a new populist tone, railing against the freewheeling excesses of the wealthy bankers who had caused the mess. But the plan had a huge risk, not least due to McCain's long record of supporting deregulation and his close ties to big business. Voters are unlikely to see McCain as a convincing populist. 'He has an uphill fight to persuade people that this is what he believes,' said Professor Rogers Smith, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. </p> <p>Instead of following his lead, the Democrats slammed McCain for interfering in something about which he knew nothing. He returned to Washington, leading a train of reporters in his wake, though he had no meaningful appointments scheduled there. Bush himself rescued McCain, inviting him and Obama to a White House meeting which caused gridlock in Washington as competing motorcades darted around the White House. As predicted, it also derailed the bail-out plan, producing only partisan rancour. At one stage a frustrated Bush said: 'If money isn't loosened up, this sucker could go down.' But even such frank language from the most powerful man in the world could not secure agreement. </p> <p>Suddenly Republican politicians broke away from the plan, leaving only Democrats still willing to work on it. In an astonishing scene, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson walked into a room where top Democrats were meeting. He got down on one knee before Speaker Nancy Pelosi and begged Democrats not to 'blow up' the deal. Pelosi and other Democrats furiously told Paulson that they blamed Republicans for the mess. 'I know, I know,' Paulson replied.</p> <p>By Friday the meetings had begun again, seeking to rescue some of the plan or come up with a better alternative. But by that time the huge Washington Mutual bank had failed overnight, the biggest such event in US history - though even such a momentous collapse was relegated to almost an afterthought on the morning TV news shows. Bush again appeared before the TV cameras, vowing that a bail-out plan would be passed but offering nothing concrete as to what or when. The political theatre took on a rare tinge of humour when Gawker, the Manhattan media gossip website, declared Paulson a 'hotty' after digging up an old photo of him standing bare-chested on a beach brandishing a large fish. 'Look at that chest,' Gawker gushed. 'The power of Paulson, indeed... Hank can bail us out any time.'</p> <p>But in Wilkes-Barre, Ken Karasek and others at a rally for Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, were not interested in Hank the Hunk's manly musculature - they were just furious at being asked to pay for his extraordinary proposal. </p> <p>Retired nurse Betty Daniels, wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with the words 'Jesus is my boss', was furious at the bail-out. 'I feel angry. People are losing their homes. They are barely making enough money to feed their families. I would like to see that money go to those people, not banks who just wasted it,' she said.</p> <p>In an already distressed area such as Wilkes-Barre the impact of the economic crisis has been profound. Over the past year more businesses have closed and many homes have been lost as the mortgage crisis has reached out and cast people out of their houses. </p> <p>When Biden took to the stage in front of the small crowd, he dished out lashings of angry politics which struck a chord with many of those present. Biden attacked Wall Street executives and a culture in Washington that had been too friendly to big business. 'The wealthy and the powerful have a seat at the table and everybody else is on the menu,' he said.</p> <p>There were echoes of that populist mood in the UK, where the Archbishops of Canterbury and York intervened in the debate, describing City speculators as asset strippers and bank robbers. Only a few months ago the churchmen would have been ridiculed for their outbursts, but now there were even some in the Square Mile prepared to admit they have a point. Investment banker John Reynolds, chairman of the Ethical Investment Advisory Group (see right) said: 'It is easy to see how abusive market practices have developed, harder to see why they have been allowed to grow unchecked by regulators. To avoid repeating the mistakes we need regulators to be more interested in understanding markets and politicians to be less in awe of money and less influenced by the seemingly munificent gestures of large companies seeking to show that they aren't just greedy bastards - when in fact they are.'</p> <p>The financial crisis has called into question a whole philosophy on both sides of the Atlantic: the so-called 'Anglo-Saxon model' of liberal capitalism which has dominated the US and the UK economies for 30 years, now with disastrous results.</p> <p>Even Irwin Stelzer, Rupert Murdoch's economic adviser, and arch-defender of free markets, admitted: 'The day when that engine of capitalism, the financial market, will be allowed to operate more or less unimpeded by government, has passed.' Veteran investor George Soros has argued that we are suffering the after-effects of a 'super bubble' fuelled by decades of deregulation and hands-off economic management - and it is time for the political tide to turn.</p> <p>The financial markets' extraordinary ascendancy can be traced back to the Ronald Reagan-Margaret Thatcher era of the 1980s. They slashed controls on markets and set finance free. In 1986, a whole series of rules and restraints were abolished in one fell swoop, the 'Big Bang'. For consumers up and down Britain, the liberation of the financial markets made it much easier to borrow. The days of queuing anxiously to see the bank manager, to persuade him to give the nod to a mortgage, or agree to an overdraft, were over. Owning shares was no longer the preserve of the wealthy few, sauntering to their brokers after lunch in a London club.</p> <p>When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, exposing the shattered state of the centrally planned Soviet economy, defenders of market freedom felt vindicated. It was, said one darling of the free-marketeers, Francis Fukuyama, 'the end of history' because the Cold War was over and the power of the market had triumphed.</p> <p>During his decade as Chancellor, from 1997, Gordon Brown worked hard to keep the City on side, boasting of its competitiveness, and nurturing it with 'light-touch' regulation. But with the crisis-hit banks now forced into pleading for charity from the state, many observers are arguing that the financial firms have surrendered their right to demand an easy ride. One stunned City veteran trying to absorb the magnitude of Paulson's plan said: 'We've just turned the clock back on 25 years of Neanderthal capitalism.'</p> <p>Already, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve are busily drawing up plans to tighten the rules on the level of assets banks must hold to secure their loans; and to ensure that financial regulators from different countries keep in closer contact. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has called for a global summit in November to rebuild the whole world financial and monetary system from scratch, saying: 'The idea that markets are always right was a mad idea.'</p> <p>Even if the Paulson plan is clinched without further delay, there is no hope of an imminent recovery either in the US or the UK.

  "<p>The Panama or Suez Canal it's not, but the main link between the east and west coasts of Scotland is experiencing a boom in trade. The Caledonian Canal, which runs for 60 miles from Corpach to Inverness, has seen a 30-per-cent-plus surge in traffic, mostly from Scandinavians as they navigate a shortcut to the popular sailing waters of the west coast.</p> <p>Despite fears over rising fuel prices and the global credit crisis, there has been a huge increase in the number of vessels from across the UK, the Baltic and Scandinavia. Between April and the end of August, the volume of traffic using the Caledonian Canal was up by 35 per cent, compared with last year.</p> <p>Highland canals manager Russell Thompson said the success of recent marketing campaigns in Scandinavia meant they were now looking into additional ways to boost the attraction even further for foreign and UK visitors.</p> <p>'Scandinavians are fairly adventurous sailors and are willing to venture further afield,' he said. 'Eastern Europe and Scandinavia has been a key area of the business and it is a growing trend. Around 50 per cent of canal traffic comes from outside the UK, and at least 30 per cent of that is from Scandinavia, particularly Sweden and Norway.' </p> <p>'Sailing is absolutely booming in Scotland, it's the second highest earner to golf,' a spokesman for Sail Scotland said. 'There was a study done recently that showed that hundreds of millions of pounds every year are flowing into the Clyde estuary area alone as a result of sailing.' </p> <p>Scotland's prestige as a top sailing destination has risen over the years and there are now plans to expand marinas around the coast, from the Clyde estuary and Kintyre to the Moray Firth and along the Caledonian Canal itself.</p> <p>Caley Cruises, a company based on the canal that rents out yachts to tourists wishing to sail down the waterway, said business had been booming this summer, despite the disappointing weather and the economic downturn. 'We have had a good season and an increase on last year,' said a spokesperson.</p> <p>'We have certainly dealt with more Scandinavians this summer. These tourists are coming from abroad because the exchange rate is so good for them and they can get so much more for their money here. We are already taking a lot of bookings for next summer.'</p> <p>The Caledonian Canal, which was designed by Thomas Telford following James Watt's survey work and was opened in 1822 at a cost of \u00a3840,000 - more than double its original budget of \u00a3350,000 - was originally intended to stem the flow of emigrants from the Highlands. There is very little commercial traffic using the canal today, making it a popular destination for all forms of water users.</p>",
  "<p>Among the quotations inscribed on the walls of the Scottish Parliament is the following from Walter Scott's The Heart of Midlothian: 'When we had a king, and a chancellor, and parliament-men o' our ain, we could aye peeble them wi' stanes when they werena gude bairns - but naebody's nails can reach the length o' Lunnon.'</p> <p>I often reflected on that quote during the early years of devolution. As a 'parliament-man' returned to Edinburgh, I bore some of the bruises from the modern equivalent of 'peebling', when things were perceived to have gone wrong. But one of the remarkable successes of the SNP government has been to protect itself from the 'stanes', not least by deflecting them in 'Lunnon's' direction.</p> <p>However, following the tumultuous events involving HBOS, the Teflon is beginning to lose some of its non-stick quality. Admittedly, in his first appearance in the Parliament, following the drama of the Lloyds-TSB takeover, Alex Salmond put in a masterful performance. With all his familiar swagger and self-assurance, he lambasted the 'spivs and speculators' and clearly implied that the UK government had been found wanting through its failure to take effective measures to combat short-sellers. What an opportunity to indulge the blame culture, especially if the culprits are in London.</p> <p>Only later did it emerge that the short-selling rate in the day before the HBOS takeover was less than 3 per cent. It was a contributory factor, but not the cause of the bank's downfall. Some of the real causes of weakness lay uncomfortably closer to home.</p> <p>But just as this set of emperor's clothing started to look a bit threadbare, Mr Salmond donned further imperial garb and announced to a Sunday newspaper that as leader of an independent Scotland, he would have acted to save Scotland's oldest bank. Billions of pounds, possibly as much as \u00a3100bn, would have been advanced by a Scottish government to rescue the bank. By Wednesday, Salmond was telling the Parliament that there had been a 'misunderstanding of the reference to the liquidity fund', but it is remarkable how many commentators laboured under that misunderstanding without the First Minister's fleet-of-foot press team putting them right earlier.</p> <p>After a long, sustained honeymoon, the former bank economist has looked much less sure-footed in responding to this major crisis. As a consequence, he has pointed up some key questions which will require answering as he makes his case for independence.</p> <p>For example, what now is the SNP's position on monetary policy in an independent Scotland?</p> <p>The most recent understanding has been that for some time after independence, Scotland would retain sterling alongside the rest of the United Kingdom. But by advocating that billions of pounds would have been made available to HBOS by an independent Scottish government, does Mr Salmond now favour a Scottish central bank and independent currency, with all the additional costs that would entail for those trading with our biggest trading partner south of the border?</p> <p>Even allowing for the possibility of a 'misunderstanding', how sensible is the policy of linking Scotland's currency to sterling? Support may be found in a recent paper for Reform Scotland's Policy Forum. Lawrence White, visiting professor at Queen's University, Belfast, noted that Scotland's exports to the rest of the UK are four times as great as exports to the euro zone. Accordingly, he argues: 'Given its current trading [and labour mobility] patterns, Scotland is more naturally a member of the sterling network than of the euro network.'</p> <p>The downside would be that monetary policy would be in the hands of the monetary policy committee (MPC) of a foreign country, not exactly a manifestation of the newly independent Scotland's sovereignty. While acknowledging that there is no precedent for MPC membership, Professor White does advance a number of reasons why Scotland should have a seat at the MPC table. But surely it stretches political credibility that a government, responsible solely to the remaining UK, should give a seat to independent Scotland, but not to Yorkshire or Wales.</p> <p>Recent events also raise the question of the future of financial regulation in an independent Scotland. In May, during Global Financial Services Week, Finance Secretary John Swinney stated that he didn't wish to undermine the competitiveness of Scotland's financial services sector and admitted that a unified 'UK' regulatory system after independence was undoubtedly an option. That, of course, means decisions affecting a key Scottish industry would be taken by a Parliament in which there would no longer be Scottish representation. But the alternative - a costly additional layer of Scottish regulation - would strike horror in the minds of Scotland's financial services sector. Some may not wait around to experience the consequences.</p> <p>These issues are not the small change of the independence debate - they are fundamental. Yet you will look in vain to find them addressed at all, let alone seriously, in the national conversation. And that takes us to the nub of the debate over a referendum. The question proposed by Salmond's government is not about the terms of independence but solely about a mandate to negotiate. The SNP government is opposed to a subsequent referendum on the negotiated terms.</p> <p>So when referendum protagonists argue that Scotland has a right to decide on its future, what they really mean is that Scotland can decide whether to give Alex Salmond a blank cheque. It would be the biggest blank cheque in Scotland's history since the commissioners were dispatched to London to negotiate the terms of Union.</p> <p>Many of them were peebled on their return.</p>",
  "<p>The financial crisis in recent weeks spread instantly through global markets. Political ideas, it turns out, are less agile at crossing continents.</p> <p>In the US, consensus was soon reached that some form of massive state intervention was required. Disagreement between government and Congress has focused on how far taxpayers should be exposed and what regulations should be imposed on bankers to make a bailout acceptable to voters.</p> <p>In Britain there is no equivalent debate. There have been temporary measures to restore confidence in markets, but no moves to reshape them for the public good. Both the Chancellor and the Prime Minister suggested at the Labour party conference last week that the financiers had lost their way, and perhaps rewarded themselves unduly. But there were no policies to reflect that view.</p> <p>Meanwhile, leading Conservatives have slipped into default positions of laissez-faire orthodoxy. London mayor Boris Johnson published a jaunty paean to the City, shadow chancellor George Osborne opposed the ban on short-selling, David Cameron warned that 'the left' might use financial turbulence as 'an excuse to wreck an important part of the British and world economy'.</p> <p>That was an uncharacteristic lapse into dogmatism by the Conservative leader. Calls for tighter City regulation are not all motivated by reactionary statism. There is a broader revulsion at the culture of financial thrill-seeking that has imperilled the whole economy. Appetite for redress cuts across traditional left-right divides.</p> <p>Neither the Prime Minister nor his Tory rival has expressed what the US political establishment grasped immediately: that the bankers' party is over; that the job in hand is to avert a catastrophe of epoch-changing proportions; that inaction for fear of offending free-market doctrine would be unforgivable.</p> <p>Gordon Brown came close when he said last week that future generations will study the events of recent weeks. He spoke encouragingly of the need for a 'new settlement'. But he did not explain what it would look like, raising suspicions that his strategy is driven as much by fear for his own position as by grand economic designs. He wants people to be in sufficient awe at the gravity of the current situation that they will rally to a leader reputed for gravitas, and reject 'novices'.</p> <p>Mr Brown succeeded at least in putting the opposition on the defensive for the first time in nearly a year. Labour's poll agonies and internal feuds have allowed the Tories to develop their ideas at leisure. It can no longer be said that they do not have policies. They would, for example, use the tax system to support marriage, divert funding on education to anyone willing to set up a new school, introduce elected police commissioners, abolish stamp duty for some first-time buyers, cap immigration from outside the EU.</p> <p>Some of Mr Cameron's plans are not sensitive to economic downturn, but others would be sabotaged by a recession - paying the private and voluntary sectors to find jobs for the unemployed, for example. That only works when there are vacancies to be filled. If the credit crunch leads to large numbers of people losing their homes and their jobs, neither private finance nor charity will provide an adequate safety net. That responsibility will lie with government.</p> <p>More generally, Mr Cameron has summarised his economic credo with the pledge to 'share the proceeds of growth' with the people. (As opposed to spending them on an expanding state.) That was a vague aspiration at the best of times; it is meaningless if the economy is shrinking.</p> <p>The Conservative leader will be judged this week on how nimbly he can adjust his rhetoric to the dramatic changes in the economic climate. That means recognising that the era of unfettered market power might be drawing to a close. The gut resistance in much of his party to any form of regulation or government intervention is a poor guide to how to respond to the current crisis.</p> <p>Radical Thatcherism is not the only Tory tradition, and blind faith in market forces should not be the party's defining feature, as Mr Cameron, to his credit, has acknowledged in the past.</p> <p>He describes his own conservatism as 'compassionate', 'liberal' and 'progressive'. But that has so far been expressed mainly as vague environmentalism and the hope of persuading charities and businesses to shoulder welfare obligations instead of the state. That is not enough.</p> <p>A truly compassionate and progressive view of the challenge now facing Britain would start by acknowledging that financial markets failed. They failed not just because of inadequate regulation, but because individual players in the City lost sight of their obligations to the wider economy and to society. They failed on their own professional terms to evaluate risk, and they failed morally, by demanding freedom from restraint and then abusing it. That should not be a matter of dispute between left and right. It is a matter of fact. Last week Gordon Brown wasted his chance to say it. David Cameron still can.</p>",
  "<p>David Haye loves this place, the enchanting little port of Kyrenia in Northern Cyprus. As he pounds the emptied roads, coaxing his lungs to pump more and more oxygen around his amazing body, warm, slow winds rustle the olive trees and the fighter's taut skin glistens in the sun.</p> <p>'Fantastic place,' he says. 'Fantastic.' </p> <p>The presence of a gregarious, life-loving fighter from south London in such a tranquil setting may seem incongruous. But it is Haye's haven from the noise of professional boxing. This is where, at 27, he has chosen to launch the closing stage of his interesting career.</p> <p>In the shade of the Benedictine monastery of Bellapaix, or 'beautiful peace', artists sketch the lovely bay below. Twenty-five miles away, United Nations soldiers patrol the Green Line, which went up in 1964 , after the Turks and Greeks on the island concluded they no longer could abide each other and would use guns and life-long hatred to prove it. Most of the 2.3 million tourists who come to Cyprus each year head for the fun and sun of the south.They leave Kyrenia to the locals. The north is lovely, but a little abandoned. There is a melancholic air about the place.</p> <p>Why here, then? 'Lovely people,' Haye says. 'It's a bit quiet, but it suits me. I can chill out. I can get on with my training. I get ready here for what is waiting for me over there.'</p> <p>Five hours' flying time from London and the boisterous Bermondsey streets where he grew up, Haye goes to work in monk-like solitude. The only hubbub in the gym he has just built behind a backstreet foundry comes from the usual sources: gabby boxers, oomphed heavy bags, the clank of barbells. The locals come every day to watch their new neighbour, curious and bewitched.</p> <p>Haye is, in a way, an accidental tourist. Northern Cyprus chose him, or rather his trainer and manager, Adam Booth, who is married to a local girl, picked it out for him: a rented house so far, a specially built one soon, when the expected earnings from his heavyweight career grow.</p> <p>The next part of their adventure \u2013 which started a decade ago when they trained at the Fitzroy Lodge Amateur Boxing Club in Lambeth \u2013 gets serious on 15 November at the O2 Arena in Greenwich, when Haye will fight at heavyweight, against a yet-to-be-named opponent, Haye has already relinquished the world cruiserweight title he won by stopping the Frenchman Jean-Marc Mormeck in Paris last November, and defended with crushing finality in the second round against Welshman Enzo Maccarinelli in March.</p> <p>Haye, who wears his fighting nickname, The Hayemaker, with the swagger of a gunslinger, has knocked out 17 others. Ismail Abdoul lasted the distance in July 2006, but aside from him Haye has knocked out all his opponents bar old, tough Carl Thompson, who knocked Haye out in his 11th pro contest, four years ago. That was always going to be a dangerous engagement, against the fighter who ended Chris Eubank's career. But Haye loves risk. It gives him the buzz he needs to perform at his best. It also makes him great box-office, a big puncher with a suspect chin who is not afraid to put that frailty on the line. There are not many like him in boxing, a business in which prospects are more often than not protected by careful match-making until they have been groomed for the big sell of a world-title fight.</p> <p>The words 'knock' and 'out' recur more than any others in Haye's conversation. He is almost obsessed with levelling his opponents. He has been described as a suicide boxer, a short-term bomb, a shooting star. He is all of these. Which is why important people in the business are drooling over the prospect of his making an impact at heavyweight, where glamour is in short supply.</p> <p>Carl King promoted his fight against Mormeck in Paris, where he got up from the canvas to record a seventh-round stoppage. I spoke to King the next day and he was still raving about Haye, so much so he started to sound like his step-father, Don. 'He is special. He is just what boxing needs. He is what the heavyweight division needs, and I will tell you why. This young man can knock them out with either hand \u2013 and he can be knocked out. That is a recipe for drama. And boxing is all about drama. Also, he is intelligent, talks well, is good looking. Women love him. Men admire him. He sells tickets. What more do you want?'</p> <p>Where Haye is like other ambitious fighters is in his towering self-belief. He will be world heavy weight champion. He will knock out the main claimant to that honour, the unnaturally large but brittle Ukrainian Wladimir Klitschko \u2013 'violently', as he put it recently. He will then knock out Wladimir's tougher older brother, Vitali \u2013 and anyone else who wants to step up. There is fire in his eyes when he fights, but he evinces quiet, articulate certainty away from the ring. He will conquer, he will rule for three years and he will walk away. The campaign starts here, in Kyrenia, now.</p> <p>It has not always been this way. I have known Haye since he was an amateur. His career was nearly over before it got going: in 1999 at the York Hall in London's East End, the light-punching Jim Twite put his lights out with a single punch. I remind him how despondent he was when we spoke later that night. He laughs. 'I don't remember that.' Well, you have good reason not to, I say.</p> <p>This was a testing time for the young boxer \u2013 and Booth. There was not enough room for the pair of them and David's grizzled, wise, old school trainer, Mick Carney, in the Fitzroy Lodge gym. Carney reckons he was the laziest and most brilliant boxer he has ever seen.</p> <p>'I was down there doing padwork,' Booth says, 'with guys like Chris Okoh, Patrick Mullings. David was 17. Started doing pads with him, talking, more pad work. It grew from there. You'd have to be blind not to see how special he was. People were saying it from when he was 15. You could see his strengths \u2013 and his weaknesses. He was lazy, no doubt about that. It was all too easy for him. </p> <p>'I said to him four days before the Jim Twite fight, \"You keep behaving like this, you're going to wake up the next morning and say, 'What the hell have I done?'\" That's exactly what happened.'</p> <p>Haye agrees. 'It was the first time I'd ever been put down. I'd never really been hurt in a boxing ring. I was 18 years old and I thought that my shit didn't stink. I thought I could go out there and do whatever I wanted to do \u2013 even when I was down. I remember I got up about eight and thinking, \"How'd the referee get to eight so quick?\" The referee was looking into my eyes and I thought, \"Who does he think he is?\" He was waving it off and I said, \"Don't embarrass me like that, man! I'm going to knock him out, you idiot.\" But it was a lesson for me. I wasn't dedicating myself like I should have done. It was one of the lowest points of my life, but it made me the man I am today.'</p> <p>What he overlooks \u2013 or maybe chooses to forget \u2013 is it took his father, Darren, an accomplished martial artist and no-nonsense cab-driver who<br>worked the streets of Catford, to talk him out of his utter desolation. Haye, always a star, now vulnerable and exposed, wanted to leave the venue by the back door. Mr Haye said: 'No, go out there in front of your friends and be a man.' He did.</p> <p>When Haye and Booth left for the Broad Street gym in London's East End, the radicalisation of his boxing began. 'Talented individuals in sporting history have a background of complacency,' Booth says. 'They don't have to strive. The way we deal with that with David is constantly putting stress in front of him, the type of opponent, the type of fight \u2013 which is why, after 22 fights, he unified the world title.'</p> <p>After the Twite knockout, Haye's boxing education reached university standard. The easy days were over. Later that year, the American Michael Simms put him out in the early rounds of the world championships in Houston, Texas, but Haye won silver at the next championships in Belfast two years later. His early paid fights followed a familiar pattern, veterans and selected opponents falling before him with pleasing regularity. Carl Thompson interrupted that progress and the doubters pounced. Haye was too flashy, they said, boxing with his hands by his side and his head in the clouds. But they did not see the growing determination and stubbornness under<br>the smile, nor the subtlety in his method.</p> <p>Promoters used to getting their own way were also frustrated with Haye, who turned down their off ers and put his total trust in the inexperienced Booth. The performance that lit a spark for Haye was his knockout of Maccarinelli. Oscar De La Hoya, the multi-titled Golden Boy, was among the many influential deal-makers impressed by his style and charisma. Haye, hands low, eyes alive, heart pounding in front of a sellout crowd, stalked the Welshman, whose nerves were equally on edge. In the second round, Haye exploded one brain-numbing headshot after another on Maccarinelli, who crumpled in the corner. It was a chilling display of raw power. </p> <p>Haye, De La Hoya now said, would 'take the heavyweight division by storm' and 'give this once glorious division a much needed facelift'. Haye would 'give fight fans around the world fights to look forward to, just like the great Muhammad Ali once did'. Evander Holyfield, too, still hanging on in the game, joined the chorus, perhaps hoping for a shootout of his own. He was at ringside in Greenwich and, even though he had not heard of Haye just a week earlier, he declared himself a fan.</p> <p>The optimism will die if Haye's trigger-quick left hook lets him down, if his chin falls apart, if the inner selfishness he conquered after a wild party time youth kicks in again. But there is no sign of this \u2013 and for that he has Booth to thank. There is something about Booth that sets him apart from nearly every other handler I have met in boxing. He wears a knowing half-smile, as if he is aware of things others can not see or understand, and he talks with a measured tone that does not invite a challenge. You can imagine Haye believing every word he says. To date, he is justified in that faith. </p> <p>'Adam talks to everybody,' Haye says, 'he's constantly looking for the best training methods. Some coaches have got too much of an ego to do that. That's what I like about him. But how he would train me is completely different to how he would train someone else. He sees the best that you've got and he works on it.'</p> <p>'Simply,' Booth says, 'he loves to get in the ring, in front of loads of people, and trade shots. I would say that's probably true of only 5 per cent of boxers. A lot of boxers actually don't enjoy what goes on. Sugar Ray Leonard admitted that the actual fighting, he hated it, because there was too much at stake. But David's got a really healthy outlook on life. He's very relaxed, always looking for where he can have a laugh. But when he's in the ring, he's scary.'</p> <p>Haye, like most big men, hated the grind of the floor work and the boredom of running to build stamina. He still does, to an extent. But he steels himself now, under Booth's persuasive guidance. He has grown up, a little late, and he appreciates the merits of sacrifice. Now, his preparation is scientific, rigid and punishing.</p> <p>All of this may have something to do with fatherhood. After years of helping himself to the pleasures of London nightlife, which a man so handsome (he has been a model for Versace and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch in his 'cleaner-cut years') can hardly avoid, Haye has settled down with wife and child, a son named Cassius. But his private life is seriously off limits, is where the affability stops. His love of privacy, so at odds with his outgoing personality, is one reason he loves Cyprus. Promoters and managers who do not have a piece of him argue that you can't make it on your own. Audley Harrison, who won Olympic gold then saw his reputation tarnished over time, is testimony to that. Haye is not sure.</p> <p>'People say, \"This is the way it is, it's a scumbag business, everyone rips you off.\" Well, actually, it doesn't have to be like that, though. If you're in control, how difficult is the job? So I've made sure that at no stage of my career have I been vulnerable. If Audley had knocked everybody out and looked great and won a world title, he would have been a genius.'</p> <p>Haye and Booth are not complete loners. They have done a partnership deal with De La Hoya to promote fighters from their stable. There are a dozen British boxers with them in Cyprus. Some are on the way up, such as David Barnes, some hanging in there, like Ryan Rhodes. Haye knows about fight budgets, where you can place certain fighters, where you can't. 'I haven't wasted my time with fighters I'm odds-on to beat. The networks, the Americans, the casinos, they're not interested in that. They love my high-risk strategy. I put it on the line \u2013 like nobody else in boxing does.'</p> <p>He has a magpie mind, swooping on detail, from small to large. Most boxers are compliant, handing responsibility to managers and promoters. Haye is buzzing for information, his laptop popping open for regular checks of fight websites. He has made it his business \u2013 because it is exactly that \u2013 to know the enemy better than the enemy know him. Is there anyone out there like him?</p> <p>'I haven't seen anyone, to be honest, nobody who sticks in my mind.' It is steamingly hot outside. Inside his gym, Haye winds up his workout, looking good at 16st 2\u00bdlb, with a bit to shave off yet, one or two muscles to firm up and then back to business for his November fight. 'There's a few doubters out there still,' he says, 'who don't think I can make it at heavyweight. They were the same doubters who didn't think I could beat Mormeck or Maccarinelli. And what happened? I knocked 'em out.' </p> <p>Haye, born to fight, born to knock people out, finds peace in a land that is quiet on the outside and raging within. Maybe it is the perfect place for him, after all.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Kevin Mitchell is the Observer's chief sports writer</p>",
  "<h2>Leo Hickman - NO</h2> <p>When you jump off that chair lift for the first time every season, fill your lungs with frigid air and glance at that mountain vista ahead, it's hard not to feel a connection with nature. Immersing yourself in this environment is arguably one of skiing's key attractions. </p> <p>But strip away the glamour and the thrills and you are left with a list of environmental woes. And that's not taking into account the fact that the busiest slope in any ski region is the line of aircraft descending to the airport. You cannot talk about skiing without mentioning climate change. Skiers, of all people, should be aware of the rapid changes occurring on the world's mountain ranges. Glaciers are in speedy retreat and snow lines are rising quickly. </p> <p>Skiers are not directly causing these problems, other than by being members of the human race. But the skiing industry is frantically, forlornly, trying to stave off the deleterious effects of climate change with a series of measures that will only exacerbate the problem in the long run. The arrival of snow cannons at virtually every major resort over the past decade is the most worrying of trends. Working through the night as the skiers' attention turns to the delights of schnapps and fondue, these spray particles of water mixed with nucleating agents into the freezing air to create a blanket of artificial snow. A lack of the real stuff has forced the industry to rely on these machines, but their environmental impact is considerable.</p> <p><a href=\"http://mountainwilderness.fr/\">Mountain Wilderness</a>, a French conservation group that described skiing as \"the cancer of the Alps\", says that 4,000 cubic metres of water are needed to cover one hectare of piste for a season \u2013 whereas a hectare of corn needs only 1,700. Across the Alps, it is estimated that artificial snow consumes the same amount of water each year as 1.5 million people. Incredibly, in some regions, tap water is used, but elsewhere river water is extracted from the valleys below and pumped back up the mountain. </p> <p>This causes two problems. First, there is the energy expenditure: Mountain Wilderness says that it requires about 25,000 kilowatt-hours, costing about \u20ac150,000, to cover just one hectare of piste with snow for a season (that's largely why the cost of ski passes has risen so much in recent years). Second, dumping river water at high altitude disrupts biodiversity because it introduces nutrients in the water into an area where they wouldn't otherwise be. </p> <p>Using artificial snow also means that the pistes now take up to a month longer than normal to melt in the summer, preventing many plant species lying dormant underneath from germinating and flowering, leading to huge muddy scars in the summer meadows where the pistes once lay. Just take a look on Google Earth at satellite images of, say, the <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/4hp36z\">Chamonix valley</a> or Aspen during the summer months.</p> <p>\"Artificial snow is not the root of all evil, but it is very close,\" says Sergio Savoia, the programme director of WWF Switzerland. \"One of the biggest problems is psychological: snow cannons give tourists the idea that it is business as usual. But we don't actually have much snow.\"</p> <p>Some low-lying resorts are experiencing winter nights that are too warm even to use snow cannons. There are reports that helicopters are being used to ferry snow to threadbare pistes in order to keep these resorts in business. In 2002, Italian police set up a task force to investigate the \"theft\" of snow from glaciers by the truck load in order to serve nearby resorts. The alternative is to abandon such resorts and chase the snow, by building new lifts and hotels further up the mountain. This is already being seen in some places. </p> <p>But, despite the promises of resort owners, how environmentally sensitive can a concrete mixer really be when taken high up into a wilderness area and put to work?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Leo Hickman is the author of The Final Call: Investigating Who Really Pays for Our Holidays (Transworld)</p> <h2>Veronica Tonge - YES</h2> <p>Many people take the view that the downhill ski industry ruins the environment, consumes vast amounts of energy and cannot possibly be in harmony with the principles of responsible or sustainable tourism. However, it has been the saviour of many mountain communities and traditions, halting the depopulation and poverty that occurred at the end of the 19th century.<br> It requires positive action, however, for a sport such as skiing, with its requirement for lifts, pistes and artificial snow, to operate on a green basis. Ski lifts and artificial snow-making do require power for the ski season; but they are increasingly efficient and clean since they no longer run on diesel and the electricity can come from renewable sources. Many resorts in Europe derive nearly all their power from hydroelectricity and, in America, Vail Resorts became one of the world's largest corporate users of renewable energy when it switched its five resorts and offices to use wind power. Lech in Austria has reduced its CO2 emissions further and improved air quality by building a biomass plant to provide heat and hot water to the resort and by providing a free public bus service to remove the need for cars. Therefore, staying for a week there could result in negligible emissions. </p> <p>So what about the chemicals in the artificial snow and the vast quantities of water it requires? Resorts have used proteins to help the artificial snow freeze at higher temperatures; however, studies have been inconclusive on the impacts. Nonetheless, some resorts have never used them, such as those in the Austrian Tyrol where the artificial snow is made from pure water \u2013 evidenced by the certified organic pastures underneath. The water is either taken from rivers or reservoirs built to store rainwater up the mountain. In Austria, the reservoirs have to undergo environmental impact assessments before construction and often end up blending so harmoniously that summer walks are routed to them. The rivers are assessed to work out the exact amount of water that can be safely taken out without damage to the wildlife and this water is even filtered to ensure that it is pure. </p> <p>And what about the delayed snowmelt? We have all seen mountains where the only snow remaining is that of the piste of artificial snow. Repeated scientific studies have found no negative impacts of artificial snow or delayed snowmelt on vegetation and, in the same way a plastic bag protects your favourite garden plants from spring frosts, artificial snow has been found to operate in the same way for the Alpine vegetation.</p> <p>Pistes are the other requirement for skiing. Although some have been created by bulldozing the mountain, there is a new technique called the 'soil push' method, whereby the topsoil and vegetation is removed as \"turf\", the land is machine-graded underneath and then the topsoil is re-laid, which effectively keeps all the plant and insect diversity intact as before. Some resorts are reducing the need for prepared pistes altogether by reclassifying advanced runs as \"itinerary\" routes which are not prepared or groomed, providing exciting challenges for experienced skiers.</p> <p>So can you ski and keep your green conscience clear? Yes, but only if you select your resort carefully. Check websites such as the <a href=\"http://www.skiclub.co.uk\">Ski Club of Great Britain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.saveoursnow.com\">Save our Snow</a> for lists of resorts that are taking positive environmental steps, but do your own research, too, by checking out the resort's own websites. They are increasingly realising that green credentials can win them more visitors. Choose the right resort and your conscience can be as clear as the mountain air.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Veronica Tonge is the author of several reports analysing the impacts of skiing</p>",
  "<p>The economic crisis. Bit depressing, isn't it? Especially if, like me, you thought short-selling was something done by leisure-wear chains in summer. It can be hard to maintain good cheer when faced with mounting debts and the perplexing colour dialectic between Alistair Darling's hair and eyebrows.</p> <p>But help is at hand in the form of a graphic novel that brings a lighter side to global recession. Le Journal de J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel is a fictional account of the rogue trader who brought the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale to its knees in January by losing them \u00a33.9 billion. He did this using something called 'fake hedges', presumably on sale from your local Homebase.</p> <p>Kerviel, who looks a bit like a harassed Tom Cruise on a bad Scientology day, became a postmodern hero. A 'Save Kerviel' fan club was set up and sold supportive slogan T-shirts. His countrymen were broadly sympathetic; a poll found that 77 per cent of French people thought Kerviel a 'victim' of Machiavellian banking practices.</p> <p>Now the book has resurrected the myth and Parisians are terribly excited; the initial print run has already doubled to 10,000 to meet demand. Xavier Thomas, the publisher, said that the aim was to produce 'a humorous take on the affair, to show the story as a simple trader with the same problems as any other young single guy in Paris'.Kerviel is portrayed in a sympathetic light, returning home to frozen dinners and renting Casino on DVD. He wears a three-button polyester suit (the shame!) and is mocked by his well-dressed colleagues.</p> <p>Maybe this will be the first of many such comic books featuring leading banking figures. US Treasury Secretary Paulson would make a good superhero - Hankenstein, perhaps? </p>",
  "<p>'We're going to fire them in groups of 10,' my boss and mentor at the investment bank told me. 'There are too many to do individually. We've had specialists in all day to train us how to handle it.'</p> <p>'What on Earth do you need training for? Surely you just tell them you're closing the division down and let them know the terms.'</p> <p>'Oh yes, wise guy - so what do you do when one of them rushes at you brandishing a chair? And what do you do if one of them collapses on the floor with a heart attack? And what do you do if one of them breaks down and starts shrieking abuse at you?'</p> <p>This conversation took place in the middle of the financial downturn of the mid-1990s when the institution at which I worked, SG Warburg, was in meltdown. It was the most frightening experience of my life to see the institution to which I had entrusted my loyalty and emotional energy disappear in front of my eyes. So I could feel nothing but sympathy for the Lehman employees who wept as they left their office earlier this month with their 158-year-old employer evaporating in the space of a weekend. The Nomura purchase of some of the London businesses will restore a proportion of their jobs, but the uncertainty now sweeping through the City reaches into every crevice. No one can feel safe.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, mental health professionals in and around the City are reporting - or expecting - a sharp pick-up in inquiries for their services. According to Stephen Garratt of London City Psychotherapy, 'now that people are being laid off, I'm getting more calls. In this environment people feel \"it's not just me - there's a much more stressful situation around\".'</p> <p>The City focus on individual performance means it is a high-pressure environment at the best of times. In a recession the pressure piles on further. In an upturn, employees scheme to obtain extra resources and the biggest possible bonus. In a downturn, they desperately try to defend their empires and avoid the sack - for themselves or for valuable colleagues in their teams.</p> <p>Power structures are transformed, leaving people acutely disoriented. In my own case I ran a sector team through the later 1990s and was effectively answerable to no one as it rapidly expanded. In the dotcom bust, suddenly regional heads seized power from the sectoral barons and managed the long-drawn-out downsizing of their empires. The abrupt transition from being a free agent (or Master of the Universe, as the popular description had it) to being answerable to others was profoundly shocking.</p> <p>According to Karen Roberts of Square Mile psychologists The Mitchell Practice: 'City people tend to be poor at managing themselves and fail to give time to family and children and other precious needs. At the same time, they have had gilded careers, so when things go wrong it's a shock.' </p> <p>As the stress builds up, the immune system runs down, leaving the individual prone to physical, as well as mental illness. Regular bouts of sickness can be a clear indicator of the impact of stress.</p> <p>The mental illnesses range from anxiety and adjustment disorder to depression. Interestingly, recent research on depression suggests that it may ultimately prove helpful to the sufferers. In this analysis, depression is seen as a forcing mechanism to stop individuals continuing in an intolerable situation. It immobilises them and compels a reassessment of goals. After the adjustment they are mentally much stronger than before, according to a Dutch study.</p> <p>This makes particular sense for City workers. Many have been lured into their careers by the huge money on offer, but they may have little affinity for the work. And when you need to put so much time and emotional intensity into an activity, you do have to enjoy it to persevere. </p> <p>Personal discontent can be disguised in an upturn but the pressures of a down-turn - the firings, the up-ending of networks, the loss of autonomy, survivor guilt - means the misery can come back at full force. In these circumstances depression may be a safety valve, forcing the individual to give up the chase. </p> <p>For senior officials in an investment bank being turned upside down, the stress can become almost unendurable as the anger of employees is concentrated on those whom they feel have let them down. The failure of Dick Fuld, CEO of Lehman, to accept a takeover at what he considered too low a price has made him a hate figure to thousands.</p> <p>At least the Lehman situation was resolved with immediate speed. The downfall of SG Warburg in the mid-1990s took place over months - in relative slow motion - and the behaviour of directors and employees became increasingly bizarre as leadership collapsed. My mentor, the chairman of the securities division of the bank, soaked up his share of the blame for the fiasco. Nine months later he collapsed with leukaemia and died within the year. In my book, Freud In The City, I concluded: 'I was, and remain, convinced that the illness had been stress-induced by the events of the previous year.' </p> <p>Why should the outside world worry or care about City woes? It is difficult to sympathise with people who earn many times the average wage. Indeed, many will have felt a delicious sense of retribution as the employees of Lehman walked sobbing out of their offices. </p> <p>But such a reaction is extremely short-sighted. The City may be at the centre of the maelstrom today, but its bad times will all too soon spread to the wider economy. At the same time, life is much rawer in the City, with its cardboard boxes full of the possessions of those fired. So the pressures that are obvious in the financial markets may well feature in a more disguised form in the rest of the economy. Those pressures will be affecting organisations and employees right round the country as the recession beds itself into the whole economy. And rising levels of depression - as well as other symptoms - are likely to be one manifestation of the growing distress. </p> <p>But of course, City workers have one great advantage in facing up to making the adjustments forced on them by depression. They tend to have higher skill levels and so have the credentials to allow them to switch to another career, even in the difficult circumstances of an economic downturn. Most of them will also have built up enough money to allow them to be flexible. The situation is more difficult for those with a lower skill base, and without financial resources. There simply may not be the opportunity to make the adjustments that the onset of depression is calling for. </p> <p>\u2022 David Freud is a former vice chairman of UBS Investment Banking, and is currently an adviser to the government on welfare reform.

  "<p>During the boom, the talk was about the next big deal, the juiciest takeover, eye-watering bonuses and the billions that banks were prepared to lend to fund an explosion of borrowing that has now brought the world financial system to the brink of collapse.</p> <p>Today, bankers and traders - the ones still in work - gather in the watering holes of Canary Wharf, Mayfair and the Square Mile. The same questions come up again and again: what will the City look like when the dust has settled? How much will they earn? Will new rules make financial services boring as regulators move to block risky, yet potentially extremely rewarding, investments?</p> <p>It is impossible to answer any of these questions with certainty, but a consensus is beginning to emerge over what the post-crash City world could look like.</p> <p>David Freud, the City author and former deal-maker at SG Warburg, speaks for many when he says that the financial industry will shrink as 'banks de-leverage, credit becomes more expensive and capital remains scarce'.</p> <p>Hedge funds look particularly vulnerable, as that industry has built its reputation on being able to offer investors stellar returns, often by taking leveraged bets on the future direction of shares, commodities, currencies or stock markets. 'Anecdotally, I have been told that a third of hedge funds will cease to exist by the time the crunch is over,' says Brian Hamill of City headhunters Redgrave Partners.</p> <p>An insider says that in London, as well as New York, hedge funds are already in trouble: 'The latest figures show that returns are 5 per cent down this year. But I hear that many have plummeted by between 10 per cent and 20 per cent.'</p> <p>In fact, the news is even worse for some: RAB Capital's Special Situations fund, which invested in Northern Rock prior to its nationalisation, has nearly halved in value.</p> <p>Some hedge fund managers are said to be invoking clauses in contracts to prevent investors getting their money out, fearful that even a trickle of redemptions could turn into a stampede. And in the febrile atmosphere that pervades financial centres today, they may be right. The heyday of hedge funds - whose astronomical pay packets have attracted the brightest graduates as well as former high-flying investment bankers - look to be past. The capital-starved banks are turning off the borrowing tap and making margin calls, which force leveraged funds to provide extra collateral as security in a falling and uncertain market.</p> <p>One executive says: 'A lot of the hedgies have done well in the boom, but many of their investors are growing disillusioned after losing money for four or five months in a row. That shatters the myth put about by the hedge funds that they do just as well when the market dives as when it's on an upward trajectory.'</p> <p>Industry sources say the hedge fund sector faces a huge shake-out and that there will be big casualties. In March, margin calls led to the implosion of Peloton Partners in London. But so far there have been fewer large failures than during the slowdown of 2005/6. That was when Amaranth Partners collapsed in the US, losing $6bn in a week on natural gas futures contracts. </p> <p>But smaller funds have been falling like ninepins. Researchers say 243 have been liquidated in the first half of 2008, the highest number in any six-month period. Only one in 10 did well enough to levy a performance fee during the same timespan.</p> <p>The widening international ban on short-selling of financial stocks will hit a lot of funds that were hoping to exploit the perilous position of institutions in the wake of the credit crunch. Shorting used to be a way of making easy money, but now hedge funds face a regulatory and popular backlash against speculators, who are deemed to have profited from the misery of others. Those hedge funds that do survive are likely to be leaner and fitter, but they will have to lose their appetite for leverage as banks pull up the drawbridge and ration capital more stringently than at any time since the Great Depression.</p> <p>Private equity is going through similar convulsions. Jon Moulton has been a vocal critic of the industry over the past 18 months, even though he runs a private equity firm himself - Alchemy Partners. He says: 'Just now, big buyouts that depend on a high proportion of debt can't be done. High leverage to equity ratios - where for every pound of equity invested, you borrow 10 - are a thing of the past.'</p> <p>Moulton is concerned that many deals concluded at the height of the credit boom could founder. He estimates that between 50 and 200 private-equity-owned companies will shortly be in danger of breaching their banking covenants, as operating profit fails to cover interest payments. Unless they can refinance on more favourable terms (unlikely in the current climate), their prospects look bleak. Moulton says: 'The upshot will be debt-for-equity swaps or bankruptcies. There is no way around it.'</p> <p>But private equity could go back to what it was like 20 years ago when there was more emphasis on nurturing and growing companies before selling them, improving operating performance and investing in the brand. </p> <p>Hamill of Redgrave Partners says: 'The industry has relied too much on financial engineering, taking cash out of acquired businesses and borrowing heavily. With the credit boom over, that model looks outdated. My guess is that transactions in the future will involve far more equity, perhaps nearer 40 per cent or 50 per cent; otherwise the banks will refuse to back deals.'</p> <p>Nor should private equity bosses expect the lavish fees they have become accustomed to. Guy Hands, one of the most senior figures in the industry, last week told a conference that 'there will be less people working in private equity and they will get paid less and that is not necessarily a bad thing'. He predicted that average holding periods for investments (before they are sold on or floated) would double to eight years, as short-termism gave way to a more measured approach.</p> <p>We can take it as a given that the whole financial landscape will be dramatically changed because the debt boom of the past 16 years is over. With its demise, we will see the contraction of a huge industry that grew up in its wake, one that spawned a heady cocktail of debt-related investment opportunities and their derivatives, with sub-prime mortgage backed securities lighting the fuse that led to the current crisis. </p> <p>As Freud says: 'Debts that in more staid times would be regarded as too hot to handle became the norm, offering generous returns, and tradeable in a debt markets that grew massively in size, scope and complexity.'</p> <p>Looking ahead, Freud envisages big changes for investment banks, many of which have been taken over by larger commercial institutions - Bank of America has acquired Merrill Lynch, while Barclays and Nomura have bought large parts of businesses formerly run by Lehman Brothers. Even Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have opted to become bank holding companies to ensure access to emergency government funding.</p> <p>So is big now beautiful in the banking world? Freud is sceptical and expects the trend to reverse over time, with banks seeking to specialise in particular areas - for instance, asset management, corporate advice or equities trading and research. 'In the 1980s, the specialists were national, but the next step is for global niche players,' he says.</p> <p>David Williams, an investment banking analyst at FPK, takes a similar view. Many banks will look at their business model and ask 'do we really want to be in this area of business? Is it consuming too much capital. Should we sell it?', he says. 'The same will go for customers, as banks ask \"which clients do we want to do business with, what areas are attractive to us?\" There are tough decisions ahead and a lot of the paraphernalia of the credit boom will be lobbed overboard.'</p> <p>So the City will contract, with fewer people employed in financial services and the banking industry more regulated and risk-averse than at any time since deregulation was introduced by the Big Bang back in 1986. For a while, at least.</p>",
  "<p>The high drama over Hank Paulson's rescue plan has been so riveting it has relegated everything else to a sideshow - even the collapse of Washington Mutual, the biggest bank failure the US has ever seen. But deeper questions lie beyond the wrangling over the bail-out, as the Archbishops of Canterbury and York highlighted in their interventions in the debate about the future of capitalism. If there is a positive side to this terrible crisis, it is that it has given us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to slay the myth of the omnipotent market. </p> <p>People in the City have never particularly claimed moral justification for their activities, but they were able to assume a mantle of authority because of the sheer volume of money they made - or appeared to make. Almost everybody - politicians, regulators, journalists, voters, mortgage borrowers - accepted the City at its own valuation; whether we approved or not, cowboy capitalism was considered unassailable. </p> <p>Those who argued that enormous bonuses were bad for the fabric of society, because they heightened inequality and undermined people's perception of fairness, were looked upon as unspeakable lefties, or just jealous. Those who argued for stronger regulation were dismissed as meddlers, bureaucrats and stiflers of innovation. And those who were uneasy about certain activities were lectured on how the trickle-down of wealth would benefit everyone.</p> <p>The archbishops were right to say there was an element of idolatry in attitudes towards financial markets; there was a widespread belief that they had a power and life of their own, that we could not control them and should not even try. But markets are there to serve society by allocating capital and supplying financial services; it should not be the case, as some seemed to think, that society should be bent out of shape to serve the interests of the City. There is nothing inevitable about Anglo-American capitalism except its propensity for booms and busts. </p> <p>The liberalisation of financial markets, the retreat of the state and the creed of 'light-touch' regulation began in the Thatcher-Reagan era and advanced unchecked under New Labour. It did appear to deliver greater prosperity, but over that time a number of powerful social contracts were weakened: between employer and employee, government and citizen, lender and borrower. </p> <p>A generation ago, middle class people could reasonably aspire to gain a professional qualification, to work for one company for most or all of their career, to retire on a decent final salary pension and to leave a debt-free legacy to their children. Those assumptions have been eroded by downsizing, outsourcing, pension fund closures, mortgage mis-selling and irresponsible lending. Society has become more unequal, more atomised and, necessarily, more selfish. In an environment where we no longer feel we can rely on being treated decently by the boss or the bank, we are less inclined to show trust and loyalty, for fear of being taken for a mug. It is not surprising that this cultural climate spawned the housing bubble, with millions of individuals placing huge bets on property, believing it was their only chance of achieving financial security for themselves.</p> <p>The government has made a pretty huge bet of its own: that our expertise in financial services would enable the UK to deliver economic prosperity despite cheaper competition from China and other developing nations. Well, what now? I have repeatedly drawn attention to the dangerous neglect of manufacturing, where, even after decades of attrition, we still have some vibrant world-class performers. Perhaps they will get more of the respect they deserve after this. </p> <p>The question 'what now?' applies even more to the US, whose own sovereign credit rating is under siege. The crisis will accelerate the shift in the balance of power towards China and other emerging countries, and will make them far more inclined to pursue their own forms of capitalism.</p> <p>In the excesses of the past few years, some forgot, if they ever knew, that the only way to make sustainable profits is the hard way: by adding genuine value, by providing superior service, by outperforming rivals. We will need to recover our memories pretty quickly.</p> <p>The City and its cheerleaders have rounded on the archbishops, saying that their moral censure may strike a chord with public opinion but is not a serious basis for reform. Maybe not, but the financial sector should not operate in a moral vacuum either. This crisis should prompt us to reappraise our relationship with money and debt, and to think hard about how we can create a fairer and more inclusive version of capitalism. There should be no return to the market's false gods.</p> <h2>More misery to come as B&amp;B folds</h2> <p>Bradford &amp; Bingley is this weekend on the brink of becoming the latest bank to succumb to the crisis. It will either be bought in a rescue deal, broken up and sold off, or nationalised along with Northern Rock; the powers the government obtained at that time were not specific to the Newcastle bank and enable it to seize others if need be. </p> <p>More smaller building societies are in need of white knights, as is Belgian bank Fortis - and that is bad news for Royal Bank of Scotland. Fortis was one of RBS's partners in its takeover of ABN Amro, and the Scottish bank risks ending up saddled with unwanted assets that were meant to go to the Belgians. </p> <p>Whether or not there is a banking bail-out here, there will be thousands more job losses in the financial sector. The idea that it just affects the City is myth; there are big hubs in places like Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds and Swindon. </p> <p>The banks have yet to see the worst of bad debts and repossessions. The Bank of England is expected to reduce base rates but the gap between base and the three-month Libor rate, at which banks lend to each other, is at its widest since Britain left the ERM in 1992. That tells us two things: banks' mutual mistrust is running very high, and there is no immediate prospect of lower mortgage rates. </p> <p>In the US, hundreds of billions of dollars of banking risk will be transferred to the federal government, adding to America's huge burden of debt and increasing its reliance on foreign investors. The dollar is likely to fall further and the yield on US government debt is likely to rise. Policymakers face formidable challenges: fighting the fire, then repairing the financial system while keeping a lid on inflation, then putting in place effective new regulation. The worst is still to come.</p>",
  "<p>The British government is attempting to torpedo a section of an international plan to eradicate tax evasion in a move that has sparked widespread condemnation. </p> <p>The Observer has established that the UK is lobbying to remove paragraph 10 from the draft Doha Outcome Document. The document, which is scheduled to be ratified in November, is the most important element in the international process intended to help developing countries wean themselves off aid and establish sustainable economies. </p> <p>Paragraph 10 focuses on fighting tax evasion.

You snowboard surrounded by gum trees and have to dodge the occasional wombat or porcupine on the slopes.</p> <h2>Although I snowboard I sometimes ...</h2> <p>Switch back to skiing. I love to ski - it's nice to go on the hill and do something totally different. You don't feel you have to be working on something or practising. It's a nice break from snowboarding. I very much enjoy putting on the skis and cruising around the hill.</p> <h2>When I'm travelling I always miss ...</h2> <p>My family.

Coming from Australia I love the beach. In the summertime my family and I are on the beach and in the wintertime we're in the mountains. I think it's that I don't get enough summer these days that my paradise is the ocean and surfing and sun. A couple of years ago I went to Tavarua in Fiji.

I love the decor and how every room is different. </p> <h2>My new treasured souvenir is ...</h2> <p>A dress I bought in Spain. A bunch of my friends bring back shot glasses from wherever they go, but that's not really my idea of a souvenir.

  "<p>Why the tone of amazement in your coverage of New Labour's meltdown? I was under the impression that the party had specifically told us our votes were unwanted. Those of us who've needed welfare shouldn't bother voting because 'we are scroungers and part of a culture of dependency'. Trade union votes were unwanted because members were 'Seventies dinosaurs'. Public sector workers had 'left scars on Blair's back' so who cares about them? Similarly Muslims, peace campaigners and those with concerns about the dictatorship of the global market can take a hike.</p> <p>As for Labour party members, their official, democratically determined conference policies included rail re-nationalisation, ending privatisation in the health service and ending council house sell-offs.

They can promote their cosmetic differences happy in the knowledge that the media 'shuts out' a wider debate of the more radical alternatives, reinforced by a fear-based electoral system that persuades people to vote to stop what they don't want, rather than casting their ballot for a party with the positive values and agenda that they actually support. Nothing will change until electoral reform persuades our media to seriously report the full range of political choice. <br><strong>Richard Denton-White</strong><br>Portland, Dorset</p> <p>You had no need to splash an 'exclusive' poll telling us that 'Gordon Brown is set to lead Labour into an election bloodbath'. We have got the message that the media has decided that Labour cannot win the next election, so that all stories about the Prime Minister and/or the government are primarily concerned with the 'trouble' in which both apparently find themselves.</p> <p>You might bear in mind that opinion polls merely record the views of a few hundred people who are not about to cast their votes.

Although the system Jenkins recommended is flawed, it would at least allow party representation in a region that is more in proportion to the number of votes.

  "<p>Peter John has known for years that the change was coming. The elders had foretold it. As a young Eskimo boy he would sit at the feet of his father and grandfather, uncles and great uncles as they arranged themselves in a circle in the qasgiq, the house built of sods dug deep into the tundra and reserved only for the men. Outside, snow would lay thick on the ground and the sea would be a single block of ice. Inside, the heat of the men's bodies would keep young Peter warm. An elder would be chosen to lead the discussion and would sometimes speak uninterrupted for an entire day.</p> <p>It was during these conversations in the dark Alaskan winters that Peter learned about the change coming. A great reversal would happen. The seasons would be turned upside down. The Eskimos from his village and all along the coast of the Bering Sea would never see the winter again. The snow would disappear.</p> <p>The elders were observant, and they formed their predictions by watching the land and sea, not for hours, not for days, but for months and years. And they passed their knowledge down by word of mouth in the village qasgiq.</p> <p>Peter is 72 now, an elder himself. Though he has lost the sight in one eye, he is no less observant than his father and grandfather before him. He has watched the change they foretold come true. In the old days the snow would be piled so high it would reach the top of the schoolhouse in Newtok, his village on the Alaskan coast. Children would use it as a snow ladder to climb on to the roof. Not any more. Most years the snow would lie thick on the ground well into June. Now it can be gone by April, bringing in flocks of geese from the south months before they are due.</p> <p>In the old days he would take the dog teams out in January or February across the pack ice to catch sticklebacks, digging holes through a layer of ice 6ft thick or more. Now it is less than 4ft thick. Then the cold was biting, but there was little wind and the sour dog plant would be covered in frosty icicles. Now the wind blows so fierce the plant is bare. And, most noticeable of all, the land itself is being swallowed up. Years ago, all he could see from his window was land stretching far into the distance. Now the water is at the village edge, moving closer and closer to Peter's house, eating away at the earth. Soon it will be Newtok's turn to disappear.</p> <p>When Peter was a child the elders told him the change was coming. Now Peter is an elder, he tells the children the change is here.</p> <p>The journey to America's first community of global-warming refugees involves a series of stages, each one more bone-rattling than the last. First comes a flight into Anchorage, Alaska's largest town, passing over the humbling magnificence of the Chugach Mountains, whose 10,000ft pinnacles have been smoothed over by glaciers like whitewash over the stones of an old farmhouse. A second flight takes us to Bethel, a regional hub of 5,000 people. It's clear we are getting somewhere now: instead of the usual glossy magazines, the counter at Bethel airport offers waiting travellers a well-thumbed book called The AR-15: Complete Assembly Guide to the Assault Rifle, Volume 2</p> <p>The last stage is a harrowing ride in a Cessna single-propeller plane, the sort that slithers through the air like a puck in a game of ice hockey. It's no comfort that before boarding you are required to tell the pilot how much you weigh. The flight covers hundreds of miles of tundra formed by the Yukon and Kuskokwim estuaries that run into the Bering Sea. In summer, thousands of thaw lakes interconnect with sloughs and streams, producing the pattern of syrup drizzled over a pancake.</p> <p>With a sudden jolt, we land along a gravel strip that sits barely above the water line. There to welcome us is a group of scraggily dressed children playing beside a notice that reads: 'No kids, no bikers, no swimming, no ATV riding allowed at the airport'. </p> <p>We have arrived in Newtok, a village of about 320 people on the southwest coast of Alaska - a location about as remote as can be found. The nearest connecting road is 400 miles away. Without the arrival of the daily plane, the villagers would be almost entirely cut off from so-called civilisation, though that would hardly bother them, as they lead a largely subsistence existence, as had their forebears for 2,000 years.</p> <p>They are Yup'ik Eskimos (not to be confused with the more northern Inuit, who are not Eskimos) and they form the largest group of native Alaskans. Yup'ik means real - and you see why when confronted by the harshness and rawness of their lives. A walk through the village reveals an extraordinary confluence of ancient ways and modernity. Peter John, for instance, lives in a wooden house raised on stilts. Now that he no longer goes out to fish and hunt, he spends his days in an armchair in his neat sitting room. From his window he can see wooden sheds where supplies of herring and salmon are drying for the winter, just as they would have been 1,000 years ago. Scattered about the village are the hides of musk ox and the skulls of walrus and moose, some with antlers 8ft across. Yet parked alongside them are hulking snowmobiles and the ubiquitous ATV quadbikes that roar between the houses.</p> <p>To add to the incongruity, Newtok's 60 houses and communal buildings are sinking and tilting at odd angles. Many are tipping downwards on their southern flank, as though they are kneeling and paying obeisance to the muddy earth. A rickety gap-toothed boardwalk connects the homes, and it too is sinking and bending in great undulations.</p> <p>Peter John's house is about 15 buildings in from the edge of the village. Walk on a further 150ft or so and you come to the Ninglick River, a wide waterway that flows out to the Bering Sea. It is here, at the edge of the water, that the vague sense of things being out of kilter forms itself into a vision of imminent disaster. In front of us a slab of land, not much smaller than Peter John's house, has collapsed and keeled over into the sea, leaving a crevice several feet wide and about 10ft deep between it and the mainland.</p> <p>I jump down into the hole and start scratching around in the mud for an explanation. About 6ft below the surface level of the tumbled earth is a layer of ice, hard to the touch, glistening faintly in the daylight. It looks unassuming, but it tells a story of monumental significance. It is permafrost, and it has been there beneath thousands of miles of Alaska, Canada, Russia and beyond for thousands of years, acting as a solid wall that holds the sea at bay and maintaining the integrity of the land. It also acts as foundations for the roads and buildings that sit upon it, Peter John's house included.</p> <p>But that glistening is ominous. The permafrost is melting. The layer of ice in the crevice in which I stand is weeping, shedding large teardrops that are quickly soaked up by the soggy earth lower down. I can see too what is left behind when the ice melts - nothing but friable soil, as soft and spongy as rum baba.</p> <p>It is this layer of melting ice that has turned Newtok into what one observer described as the Ground Zero of global warming. According to Nasa, temperatures in Alaska have risen more than any other place on the planet in the past 50 years - by some 4F on average, and up to 10F in winter. The Arctic in general has experienced a rate of warming that is double the earth's average, in part as a result of what is known as positive feedback. The brilliant white surface of ice and snow normally reflects most radiation from the sun back into space. But once the ice starts to melt through warming temperatures, the exposed land absorbs the radiation, thus causing further warming and melting. The vicious cycle set in train melts the frozen segment of tundra that forms the permafrost. Reports suggest it is thinning by more than an inch a year, turning a once rock-solid fortress into floppy gunge. </p> <p>It doesn't take much imagination to conceive of the impact on the 90,000 Alaskans who live on top of the permafrost, most of them Eskimos or Inuit. The few roads that exist are now cracking and caving in, like Newtok's undulating boardwalk. Of the state's 213 Alaska Native villages, 184 are severely affected by erosion and flooding. Six have been classed in need of immediate help, and of those Newtok is top of the list.</p> <p>The village has felt the impact in so many ways. The piles on which houses like Peter John's are built used to be driven 8ft down; now they have to go 12ft - and even that isn't enough. As the permafrost melts, so the buildings sink, hence the odd angles. Every year villagers prop up their houses using hydraulic jacks in a futile attempt to level them. The reason the houses are all bowing down to the south now becomes clear: the warmth of the southern sunlight causes a disproportionate melting of the permafrost.</p> <p>The greatest threat comes from the water. The land on which Newtok is built is being swallowed up at an astonishing pace. With no permafrost as buttress, the tundra is as defenceless against the pounding waves as a sandcastle is to the rising tide. In Newtok's case, the waves do most damage in late summer, when they are whipped up in fierce storms that each year seem to grow more angry - a further symptom of global warming caused by changing weather patterns further north. The water undercuts the topsoil until it topples over in enormous clumps like the one I am standing beside. As a result, the sea is marching in the direction of the village at a rate of up to 90ft a year. It has already swallowed up a barge landing where the villagers used to moor their boats. Within two years, the first houses on the outskirts of the community are likely to be consumed, and Peter John's and all the rest will follow suit within a year or two of that.</p> <p>Stanley Tom, the village administrator, the modern equivalent of tribal leader, is spearheading the effort to relocate the entire community to a new home across the water. On the second morning of our visit he takes us out in his aluminium fishing boat to the new site - an island about nine miles to the south.</p> <p>It is here on Nelson Island that America's first global-warming refugee camp is being built. Three houses, neatly arranged on stilts in the style of Peter John's home back in Newtok, are already nearing completion. The villagers built them themselves, with the help of government grants, on land that is high enough up the hillside to be safe from the dangers of climate change - rising sea levels, flash flooding, erosion - for decades, if not centuries, to come. The first three homes have been assigned to village elders, including Stanley's father, Nick Tom. As Stanley shows us around the new houses, with their wood-burning stoves and mail-order catalogue kitchens, he talks of his huge relief that the move has begun. 'The elders are our advisers; they are our resources. We owe it to them to provide them with a life without trouble and worry. I can sleep at night now, knowing my father will be safe.'</p> <p>Also palpable is Tom's excitement about the natural abundance that he sees all around. The new village will be called Mertarvik, meaning 'getting water from a spring' - a reference to the ample supply of drinking water on the island. Wild musk ox have been spotted on the island and in the surrounding waters there is ample summer fishing of white fish, herring and halibut. The hillside on which the houses are rising is covered with bushes bearing berries that form an essential part of the Eskimos' diet. In late July or August they gather nagoonberries, cranberries, crowberries, blue-, black- and red-berries. They mix them with oil rendered from seal blubber and sugar to make akutaq - berry ice cream that is the centrepiece in winter festivities which help to while away the long, dark months. On our way back to Tom's boat he suddenly drops to his knees among a patch of salmonberries and declares them almost ripe and ready to pick. 'Oh man! These are really plump and nice,' he exclaims. 'These are the best! Better than shopping in a grocery store.'</p> <p>Back in Newtok, his excitement at the natural riches of the new village slumps into frustration as he relates the difficulties of organising the evacuation. The relocation of even such a small community has proved a massive undertaking, involving liaison with countless different government bodies and agencies. Tom has clearly had his fill of dealing with bureaucrats. 'There's a lot of pressure on me. The federal agencies are so slow, and I get stressed out. We're stuck in the middle: the old village is crumbling, because no one wants to spend money on a place that is about to move, but the new village isn't ready either.'</p> <p>We are talking over lunch in Tom's house at the far end of the village. Nearby you can still make out the outline of the old qasgiq, where the young Peter John used to sit at the feet of the elders. Tom serves a stew made from wild emperor geese shot by his sons, washed down with tundra tea, an infusion of a local bush that looks like rosemary. The feast fails to improve our host's mood. The worst thing, he says, has been the frequent remarks from outsiders that the villagers should all move to Bethel or Anchorage, or co-locate to one of the neighbouring villages that haven't been so affected by global warming. 'That will never happen. They wanted to move us to a barbed-wire camp in Anchorage, but we can't live the urban life. We are not used to it,' he says.</p> <p>At best, Newtok can expect only ambivalent support from the state authorities in Juneau, 1,000 miles away. Alaska's new lipstick-wearing pitbull megastar, Sarah Palin, is intellectually challenged when it comes to global warming. Soon after she was thrown into the spotlight as John McCain's presidential running mate she said: 'A changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state, because of our location. I'm not one, though, who would attribute it to being man-made.' A few days later she tried to retract her statement, but her sentiments as a global-warming denier were crystal clear.</p> <p>The villagers have at least found in one official a powerful advocate. Sally Cox, an Alaska state planner, has rebutted the idea of paying the villagers to move into the cities. 'Often people say: why can't they just relocate, to another village or a town, to spare the government the huge cost of moving Newtok? But they have lived along this coast for millennia; their whole identity is embedded in their surroundings,' she tells me when we meet in Anchorage.</p> <p>Astonishing figures have been put on the cost of moving Newtok. One estimate put the total expense at $130m. Across the state of Alaska, the current bill to repair damage to infrastructure caused by global warming is already put at $3bn, and this could rise, according to some estimates, to $80bn by 2080. Looked at this way, the option of plonking the villagers of Newtok in some urban condo starts to appear more desirable. But Cox dismisses such thinking as alarmist. 'The figures are misleading. We are going to show in Newtok that it's not going to cost anything like as much.'</p> <p>Stanley Tom's point about the villagers being unprepared for urban life is spelled out the night his cousin Margaret Nickerson pays us a visit. She has decided to treat us to a classic Eskimo dinner. She pulls out a plastic bag and empties out an assortment of dried fish - herring, salmon, blackfish, pike, sheefish. She shows us how to eat it, dipping each piece in a bowl of clear yellowy liquid that turns out to be seal oil. As a final delicacy she produces a lump of black shrivelled flesh that resembles beef jerky. It is the dried ribs of a seal.</p> <p>As I chew gingerly on the meat, she tells me that the villagers go hunting for maklak - the bearded seal - every spring. The first catch of the year is marked by a great party where they celebrate by eating the seal's raw liver dipped in seal oil. She goes on to explain that the life of the village is arranged around the seasons. Yup'ik names for the months follow the pattern of hunting. April is Tengmiirvik or When the Birds Come, in reference to the five species of geese as well as tundra swans, ducks and seabirds that they hunt. March is Nayirciq - Birth of Seals. The ice-free summer is a time of fishing and berry-picking, and the autumn of tracking moose and caribou. In late September, before the ice sets in again, there is time to go after the berry-fattened fowl. </p> <p>It is remarkable how much of the traditional Eskimo way of life has survived the wave after wave of outside intervention that has tried to eradicate it. The first wave, from the 1700s, brought Russian fur hunters in search of beavers. Their legacy is still incorporated into the native language. The Yup'ik for white person is Kass'aq, a derivative of Cossack. </p> <p>Russian Orthodox priests gave way to Jesuit missionaries, who left an even greater impression, not least in the diseases they brought. A flu epidemic in 1900 halved the native Alaskan population in just three months. The old church we are using as a dormitory is lined with books on Jesuit theocracy. Local names, like Peter John, Stanley Tom, Margaret Nickerson, are all Jesuit impositions that now take preference over their native Yup'ik names (Peter John's traditional name is Miisaaq, but he rarely uses it). Other artefacts of the Jesuits are the Bible on Peter John's table and his Hohner Special 20 harmonica. He was given the instrument and taught how to use it by the missionaries. He plays it for us, starting with hymn music and then segueing into the Forties classic 'You Are My Sunshine'. </p> <p>There was one other legacy of the Jesuits. They abolished the qasgiq where he used to listen to the elders impart their wisdom. The missionaries considered the communal living quarters an affront to the nuclear family and had it torn down. </p> <p>After religion came education. The Yup'ik people were nomadic until the Seventies, travelling between summer and winter camps. But from 1976 Newtok became a sedentary community under instruction from the education authorities so that their children could benefit from year-round classes. They were taught in English from set texts written thousands of miles away in the big cities of America. Margaret says she remembers having her hands whipped at school because she was heard speaking Yup'ik. 'I used to look up at the teacher as he beat me and think to myself: \"Wait till I'm grown up, then it won't be your turn any more. It will be my turn.\"'</p> <p>Russians, Jesuits, pedagogues. The residents of Newtok are now feeling the impact of a fourth wave of outside interference. Only this time it is invisible: molecules of CO2 pumped into the air from the heavy industrial centres of continental America.</p> <p>It is a cruel irony that the Yup'ik people are among the first US citizens to feel the lash of climate change, as their way of life is deeply ingrained with respect for nature. As children, they are taught that they will be punished if they abuse the animals they hunt. 'Seals, birds, fish - they know what kind of person you are,' says Margaret. 'If they see you are the kind who will make good use of their meat, then they will make themselves available to you to be caught. But if they see you are the kind to waste it and leave it to rot, then they will hide and you will go hungry.'</p> <p>Peter John, sitting in his armchair, says that he was taught similar beliefs by the elders in the qasgiq. 'They would tell me: \"If you come across a sick or dying animal, you must care for it, put it somewhere dry. If you mistreat that animal, it will give you less and less.\"'</p> <p>It is true that the villagers are not blameless innocents in their relationship with the environment. On our way out of Newtok, back at Bethel airport, I notice a poster with a photograph of a magnificent bird soaring over the tundra. 'Help us save the emperor goose,' the poster says. 'It is endangered. Don't hunt it.' Then I remember the feast Stanley Tom cooked for us... emperor goose stew.</p> <p>It is true, too, that Eskimos have enjoyed the spoils of a fossil-fuel economy along with the rest of us. They have traded in their kayaks for motor boats. They have retired their huskies and replaced them with snowmobiles, saving themselves the labour of fishing for sticklebacks to feed the dogs. The combustion engine has allowed them to travel much greater distances over the pack ice in search of seals or caribou, while every week the plane brings in boxes of Cossack food - baked beans, chocolate, Coke - to spice up the repetitive winter diet. </p> <p>But none of that alters the fact that these first American refugees from global warming have been dealt a very poor hand. Most of the greenhouse gases responsible for the melting of the permafrost were pumped into the air not in Alaska itself, but in the industrialised regions of continental America, the 48 contiguous states that the Eskimos call 'lower 48ers'. Alaska is a major oil producer, but you won't find much of the black gold consumed in Newtok. 'Lower 48ers are doing most of the polluting that causes climate change,' says Stanley Tom. 'Compared with them, we are a little tiny scratch on the surface.'</p> <p>There is a wider lesson here for America. If the richest nation on earth cannot cope easily with relocating even such a minuscule community faced with imminent destruction from global warming, what hope is there when climate change really starts to bite? What happens to the 15m people living on the coast of Florida at risk from rising sea levels? Or the millions more in the desert across the American southwest facing devastating droughts?</p> <p>At least there are signs of hope for the residents of Newtok. The state of Alaska has just pledged $3m to build a barge landing and road up to the new site, and once those are in place the heavy work of building the new village can truly begin. The US army corps of engineers and the Marines have both promised to help. Things are finally on the move.</p> <p>Sally Cox is confident that they might be able to meet the target of transferring all Newtok's 320 residents to their new homes by 2012. It will be none too soon, judging by the relentless march of the water. 'If all the pieces fit together, I think we could do it,' she says.</p> <p>Just before we fly out of Newtok a beaming Stanley Tom calls us into his office and says he wants to show us something. He opens a box that has just arrived on the Cessna, and pulls from it a plan of Mertarvik. The map shows the prospective barge landing and a spanking new road curling up the hillside. The new village itself is shown on top of the hill, shaped like a boomerang. In the middle will be the communal buildings: a school, of course, a church certainly, and (whisper it) a communal building imbued with some of the spirit of the old qasgiq. The map shows three small icons like tiny crosses on the edge of the village. These will be the wind turbines they hope will meet most of the community's energy needs; unlike Mephistopheles the villagers have no desire to inflict their grief on others.</p> <p>One other feature of the plan stands out. There, on the hillside beneath the new houses, is an area marked on the map with cross hatches. It has a word stamped over it: Naunnaviit. I ask Stanley Tom what the word means. He replies: 'Berry patches'.</p>",
  "<p>It is one of the world's greatest hidden epidemics, but the search for a solution is hopelessly underfunded. On average, every minute of every day a woman somewhere dies in childbirth or pregnancy, the overwhelming majority in developing countries.</p> <p>It is estimated that they number more than half a million every year, in what Norway's Prime Minister, Jens Stoltenberg, told the United Nations last week was 'the biggest expression of brutality to women I can imagine'.</p> <p>One of the UN's eight Millennium Development Goals in 2000 was to reduce the ratio of maternal mortality - the number of mothers who die per 100,000 - recorded over the period 1990-2015 by three quarters. But as the 2015 target date gets ever closer, it has become clear that attempts to lower the death toll have failed. </p> <p>Even as Sarah Brown, wife of the British Prime Minister, became a patron last week of the campaign to reduce deaths in childbirth, Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organisation, was conceding how little had been achieved. 'Despite two decades of efforts,' she said, 'the world failed to make a dent.' </p> <p>Chan was addressing a high-level UN taskforce, whose members - including Gordon Brown, the World Bank president Robert Zoellick and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner - are calling for billions more dollars in aid: $2.4bn next year, rising to $7bn by 2015. 'We still have time, but just barely, to make up for this failure,' Chan added. 'The number of maternal deaths will not go down until more women have access to skilled attendants at birth and to emergency obstetric care.' </p> <p>With almost 99 per cent of maternal deaths occurring in the developing world, the differences in risk for women in those countries, in comparison with Europeans, are staggering. One in every seven women in Niger will ultimately die of pregnancy-related causes, whereas in Sweden the lifetime risk is one in 17,400.</p> <p>Sierra Leone remains a stark reminder of that contrast, suffering one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world, with one in every eight women dying in childbirth, according to Unicef. The experience there mirrors that in most of sub-Saharan Africa, where the maternal death rate has remained almost unchanged since 2000. </p> <p>Thousands of women die every year in childbirth in Sierra Leone, which is at the bottom of the UN's human development index and where life expectancy is 41. Although care is officially free for pregnant women and under-fives, the health service is failing miserably. Only 40 per cent of the population has access to healthcare.</p> <p>For the million-strong population of the capital, Freetown, there are only 162 government health workers trained to deliver a baby. Countrywide, there is one doctor for every 33,000 people or more, compared with one to 600 in the UK. 'Women are dying unnecessarily in pregnancy and childbirth,' says Barbara Stocking, director of Oxfam, which is calling for universal access to healthcare and for donor aid to go straight to national health budgets. 'It destroys families - children are motherless; husbands without wives; parents lose a daughter; siblings lose a sister.' </p> <p>The health of mothers is crucial for the survival of families and economies, and cuts to the heart of any society. Pregnant women in Sierra Leone need what pregnant women need everywhere: trained midwives and doctors, access to properly equipped hospitals and essential medicines. </p> <p>Deaths relating to obstructed labour, eclampsia, severe bleeding, anaemia and infection are often avoidable through simple measures, such as provision of better prenatal care and primary health facilities with trained staff.</p> <p>Official government policy is to provide free drugs, consultations and essential vaccinations for vulnerable groups, including children under five, children attending school and pregnant and breast-feeding women. Common drugs are also meant to be provided on an affordable basis to everyone. </p> <p>However, this is far from the reality: a recent survey found 90 per cent of respondents were paying for drugs, 43 per cent for consultation fees and 21 per cent for basic vaccines. In the eastern region of the country, around 90 per cent of those surveyed were still paying for antenatal and under-fives' healthcare.</p> <p>The White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood, led by Sarah Brown and supported by Naomi Campbell, Erin O'Connor and Claudia Schiffer, is campaigning to help these women, as are NGOs such as Oxfam.</p> <p>What can be achieved in this area has been shown by the experience of Sri Lanka, a developing country that now has a trained midwife for every 1,800 people. While Sri Lanka now suffers a total of 190 maternal deaths per year, Niger, which has a smaller population, has 14,000 maternal deaths every year - and only one midwife for every 33,500 people. </p> <p>Despite the urgent need to reduce the death rate of women in childbirth, Robert Zoellick delivered a note of caution over the UN's ability to raise the billions of dollars that are needed, saying that he was 'concerned' over the impact that the global financial meltdown might have on programmes such as the Millennium Development Goals.</p>",
  "<p>The All Blacks were playing England, and after the half-time whistle blew they found themselves 50-0 ahead, Jonah Lomu scoring eight tries. The rest of the team decided to head for the pub instead of playing the second half, leaving Jonah to go out on his own. 'No worries,' said Jonah, 'I'll join you later and tell you what happened.'</p> <p>After the game Jonah headed for the pub where he told his team-mates the final score: 95-3. 'What!' said a furious Michael Jones. 'How did you let them get three points?'</p> <p>Jonah replied apologetically: 'I was sent off with 20 minutes to go.'</p> <p>(New Zealand rugby joke, circa 1995)</p> <p>No one is quite sure when England started playing boring rugby. I ask Eddie Butler, The Observer's rugby correspondent, and he goes silent for a few seconds before suggesting, '1923, I suppose, more or less.' Think of the French, and you picture exuberance and extroversion, a wave of blue shirts running the ball out from behind their posts. The Welsh have always produced players who appear to be worryingly frail, but who prosper by sleight of hand and whirring feet and make fools out of the lumbering forwards. The southern hemisphere has, seemingly from the start, played an athletic, mobile game defined by innovation and all-round excellence.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the country that invented the game traditionally play at their own pace. At their best, England are brutal, formidable, obdurate and efficient. They are never easy to beat - always strong, well prepared and never lacking courage - but they are not always very good at winning games. They experimented with expansive, daring rugby for 80 minutes back in 1991 and found that it was not for them; that occasion, regrettably, was the World Cup final against Australia at Twickenham, an afternoon that still rankles with some of those on the field: 'They were playing totally against their nature, as eight forwards will tell you to this day,' Butler says.</p> <p>The archetypal English player is rugged and fearless, not afraid to mix it up. Their approach is caution first, keep it tight, get the three points in the bag. They prided themselves on being the first nation to embrace professionalism, bringing a new physicality to rugby. Think of the heroes of 2003: Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jonny Wilkinson - is it my imagination or did they, after years of battering, even start to look alike? Their heroic jaws jutting out, expressions glowering and taciturn, their faces like 'a Christmas present from Easter Island', as Philip Larkin memorably described Ted Hughes. Certainly, these are the men whose shadows loom large over the game in England.</p> <p>The flip side is that you can almost count the number of flamboyant English players on one hand. There was Prince Alexander Obolensky, whose family fled the Russian Revolution in 1917, before settling in Muswell Hill, north London. 'The Prince' made his England debut in 1936 in a 13-0 victory against the All Blacks; he scored two tries, including one individual effort that covered most of the field and may be the greatest ever scored in England colours. Sadly, he would win just three more caps, and the flying winger died in 1940 at the age of 24, when his Hawker Hurricane crashed in Suffolk. They don't make them like that any more.</p> <p>Who else? In the late Sixties, David Duckham possessed the most outrageous sidestep in the game and the ability to send TV cameras the wrong way with his dummy. He made his greatest impact on the British Lions tour to New Zealand in 1971, when he scored 11 tries and was renamed 'Dai' by Welsh supporters, but that was not enough for England to build a team around him. Even greater injustice befell the mercurial Bath fly-half Stuart Barnes, who won just 10 England caps in the Eighties, as selectors preferred his metronomic rival Rob Andrew (the architect of that 1991 defeat). In recent times, only Jeremy Guscott and Jason Robinson have threatened to break the mould, but being isolated at outside centre and on the wing and full-back, respectively, their impact has been fleeting, a tantalising glimpse of what could be possible.</p> <p>Then on 15 March this year, England played Ireland in the final round of the Six Nations. The match was ostensibly a dead rubber - both sides had won two, lost two, and the title would be fought out between Wales and France - but it did not take long to realise that something special, perhaps even culture-changing, was taking place at Twickenham. Ireland built an early 10-0 lead, but England regrouped and posted 33 unanswered points; it was a performance of composure, fluidity and vibrant rugby, the likes of which many home fans had never experienced. Moreover, the inspiration was a 20-year-old kid in a scrum cap playing at fly-half in his first full international. 'I just thought it was one of the most outstanding individual performances I have ever, ever seen,' says Lawrence Dallaglio now. 'And I include any sportsman across the world in that estimation.'</p> <p>And this is why I am currently in a photographic studio in west London with three near-naked models and Danny Cipriani, looking right now like the cat that got the cream, the sardines and a date with Kelly Brook.</p> <p>Danny Cipriani is a handsome man, and you suspect that he does not need reassuring of this fact. 'Not too shabby,' one of the models says as we stand over a Polaroid and, despite himself, he cannot stop a smile escaping. It is not unprecedented for rugby players to start out with these looks, but the necessity to bulk up for the game and a few years at the bottom of a ruck tend to add a little more 'character' to their faces. Whether Cipriani is a good enough player to stop that happening is one of the things that we will have to find out.</p> <p>Much has happened in the six months since the Ireland game - notably a career-threatening injury and those nights out with Brook, more of which later - but it is the hope and excitement that Cipriani inspired that day that remain top of the agenda. Just as Jonny Wilkinson knew from the age of eight that he would play for England, there was something preordained about Cipriani's rise. The night before the game, he sat up in bed and realised that he had been dreaming about this moment all his life. He had been warned that he would probably only sleep for four hours, but not to worry, that would not affect his performance the next day. He was ready.</p> <p>'Right from an early age he was ambitious enough to say that he was going to be England fly-half, he had that inner belief,' says Adrian Norris, the director of sport and first XV coach at Cipriani's secondary school, Whitgift in Croydon. Norris's most vivid memory of the schoolboy remains the first time he saw him play, aged 14. 'He did about five things,' he recalls, 'the first thing was a spiral kick off his left foot the full length of the pitch, which was admirable at that particular time but not outstanding; the next play he did exactly the same thing off his right foot; the next two things were an accurate long miss pass, one off his left hand and one off his right hand. He had a tendency at that age to try absolutely anything. Whereas most people would put a grubber-kick through, he would put a grubber-kick through with the outside of his wrong foot. That sort of stuff.'</p> <p>Cipriani was obviously a precocious natural talent: his skills extended to football, where he was offered terms by Reading; to cricket, where he might have played for Surrey; and to athletics, where he competed in high jump and 200 metres at the Track and Field Schools' Cup. But by age 15, he had joined London Wasps, just as the club began their domination of English rugby, and he was playing age-group rugby for England. Still he was not satisfied. To make the next step, in his last year at school, he sought out the services of fitness coach Margot Wells, the wife of Allan Wells, the 1980 Olympic 100m champion, and an irrepressible, hugely likeable woman who has been his trainer and confidante ever since. (For the record, Cipriani paid for his sessions out of his own pocket then, and still does now.)</p> <p>'My job is to give him the physical and mental qualities so he can do whatever he wants,' says Wells, sounding like Alfred Pennyworth to Bruce Wayne's Batman. 'And I just knew from day one that he wanted to be this superstar, wanted to play for England, wanted to play at the highest level he could play. He was 18 when we started and, to be honest, you very rarely get that level of dedication and commitment from someone so young. They normally grow into it, but he had it at the very beginning; he said, \"I want to be the best. I want you to make me the best that I can be.\" That's easy for me, I love that.'</p> <p>If people know one thing about Jonny Wilkinson, it is that he will stay out practising kicking until the balls disintegrate into rags. If they know one thing about Cipriani, it is probably the News of the World story that he spent the night with a woman called Larissa Summers, who was reportdely a transsexual. That subsequently turned out to be false, though not before the Wasps dressing room had given him the post-modern nickname 'Danny Cipriani Who Slept With A Man'. But, everyone agrees, Cipriani has a formidable work ethic of his own and considerable reserves of mental fortitude. Thanks to his work with Wells, he is now the quickest player at Wasps, faster even than his England team-mate Paul Sackey.</p> <p>'Danny is not obsessive about any part of his game,' Wells says. 'He will work equally on his speed as he will on his skills as he will on his kicking. He works exceedingly hard, he's very diligent in what he does, and he's dedicated to being the best he can be in a very all-round manner. But he's not obsessive. Obsessive to me means overdoing things, you do too much, you don't have balance in all parts of your life.'</p> <p>Against Ireland in March, we would see the product of some of these qualities. The situation could scarcely have been more dramatic. Having earlier appeared as a substitute against Wales and Italy, Cipriani had been due to make his first start the week before the Ireland match at full-back against Scotland, but was dropped when he was photographed coming out of a Mayfair nightclub on the Wednesday night before the game - he claimed he was just dropping off some tickets. Scotland duly thumped a spineless England 15-9 and Cipriani was recalled by then-coach Brian Ashton, this time to replace Wilkinson at fly-half. The record points scorer in rugby history would watch the Ireland match from the bench, offering an insurance policy in case the 20 year old debutant crumbled.</p> <p>That, of course, never looked like happening. In an enduring image, Cipriani took charge of the pre-game huddle, barking orders at England's much vaunted pack of forwards. 'I couldn't go into playing fly-half for England quietly, because it's just not me,' he explains. 'I didn't want to go in there half-heartedly.' There was little danger of that. Watching the game again, you are reminded of something that his school coach Adrian Norris had said about the 14-year-old Cipriani: often his thought processes were so far out, so advanced that his team-mates would struggle to keep up. But gradually, the angles of his runs and the timing of his passes started to make sense, and he coaxed performances from players, notably Jamie Noon, that were the best of their international careers. He also converted seven place kicks out of seven.</p> <p>When Wilkinson came on, as a replacement at inside centre after 53 minutes, it looked like Cipriani shouted at him, too. 'In some pictures you can make someone look drunk, if their eyes are half-shut,' he says. 'There was no time that I was bossing Jonny around on the pitch.'</p> <p>As the models file out, mwa-mwahing their goodbyes, Cipriani sits down and starts to talk. His voice is soft and polite and his conversation is dominated with goals, purposes, processes, mindsets and structures. He is smart and articulate, certainly, but sometimes he does not even seem to be speaking about sport, or even real life, at all. There is a logic to the occasional mundanity of his analysis: how can you possibly say anything meaningful about something as instinctive and beautiful as the timing of a pass?</p> <p>From the outside, Cipriani's most remarkable quality is his bulletproof self-belief. 'What I like about Danny,' says Lawrence Dallaglio, his team-mate for two seasons at Wasps, 'is that he will do something on the rugby pitch and it won't always work, and everyone will shout at him and say, \"What the hell did you do that for?\" And it will cost him. Then 10 minutes later he will try it again and it will work. He's not put off, his confidence is not damaged by that and that shows as much as you need to know about him.'</p> <p>Case study one: earlier in the 2008 Six Nations, Cipriani was introduced as a replacement for Wilkinson against Italy. One of his first actions was to have a clearance kick charged down, leading to an Italian try and a tense last few minutes before England came through 23-19. So, you come on for a legend of rugby and nearly throw away the game to a team that have never beaten England - how does it feel? 'I remember how I felt and obviously I was gutted,' Cipriani says. 'But the next time I got the ball I hit a 60-metre kick into their 22. That was my process back on to the straight and narrow. You can't worry about it too much, otherwise you are going to get bogged down by mistakes, it's going to be like a snowball effect. So that's why whenever something happens, I just move on.'</p> <p>Lesson one: there is a big difference between making a bad decision and not executing a skill. The Italy game was simply an example of failing to execute a skill properly.</p> <p>Cipriani has obviously been heavily influenced in his approach by Shaun Edwards, the head coach at Wasps and the defensive coach for Wales and provisionally next year's Lions, who tour South Africa. A hero of rugby league, Edwards was a famously redoubtable player - he took part in 33 domestic finals and won every single one - and he has become a formidable presence in rugby union. Once he says something, it stays said. 'I was always taught by a great coach I played under years ago, the biggest risk is not to take one,' he recalls. 'Danny certainly lives by that motto.'</p> <p>Edwards works a lot with Cipriani on leadership qualities, so he was particularly pleased with the manner that he took control against Ireland. 'The forwards don't want a shrinking violet playing No 10,' he says. 'He's a fly-half, he's the guy who controls the game. Those are the kind of guys if they don't have an air of self-confidence around them, there's no doubt that they won't be the player they want to be. Who wants a leader who has no confidence in themselves?'</p> <p>There's confidence and then there's Cipriani. An only child, he was brought up by his mother Anne, who drives a black taxi; Jay, his father, separated from Anne soon after Danny was born and returned to Trinidad &amp; Tobago. Their early years were spent on the Lockyer Estate in Putney, but through scholarships and his mother putting in 'ridiculous hours' in her cab, Cipriani attended some of the best private schools in London. 'I just wanted to be successful,' he recalls. 'My mum worked extremely hard, so that does give you determination.'</p> <p>At school, he was criticised for being a bad loser ('Why would you want to be a good loser?') but, then again, he was not getting beaten too often. 'Some people are good at maths, some people are good at science; I was never good at either of those,' he remembers. 'I just loved being on the sporting field and taking part.'</p> <p>Adrian Norris gives a similar impression of him. 'Was he a prima donna? Would he come down late for training?' he says. 'Far from it. He'd muck in in the changing room. If he was told to pick up the cones, he'd pick up the cones.'</p> <p>While Cipriani's outlandish play has led some observers to see him as flash or arrogant, Dallaglio simply sees him as a product of his environment. 'There's only two rules at Wasps really,' he explains. 'One, you leave your ego at the door; secondly, that you work very honestly and very hard. And if you do those two things then you are going to get on pretty well. With Danny there's a little bit of swagger, a little bit of arrogance, but that is quite readily accepted at Wasps as well, because that is the London way. I always find that people who are predominantly brought up in the bright lights and the big city tend to have a little bit of that because it's what differentiates yourself, because you are what you have been exposed to.'</p> <p>On 18 May, two months after the Ireland game, Cipriani was jackknifed by a tackle from two Bath players and his right ankle was dislocated and fractured. A sickening crack was heard around the ground, soon followed by the player's screams of agony. Everyone immediately knew that the worst had happened: team-mates, fans, Cipriani himself. 'I was running along and my ankle spun,' he remembers. 'My whole body went numb before I did it, so when I looked at my ankle that's when I realised. My brain said, \"That's your ankle. It's in the wrong shape. This is how you are supposed to feel.\" And suddenly the pain kicked in.</p> <p>'The doctor put the ankle back in place on the pitch,' he continues. 'That was probably the most painful thing, because you could feel it twisting in the wrong shape. I was sat there and obviously I was in tears and it was just the fact that I was thinking, \"Is this it? Is this me done?\" All those thoughts go through your head...'</p> <p>Cipriani's voice trails off and it is not hard to imagine how he might have felt. It was the first major injury he had suffered, and it must have been one of the few times in his sporting life where his destiny was out of his own hands. Outstanding natural talents are known to be particularly susceptible to complications coming back from injury - because they find the game so easy, the effort required to rebuild their skills can be difficult to summon. There are examples across British sport, not least Michael Owen, Andrew Flintoff and, most recurringly, Jonny Wilkinson.</p> <p>However, as Cipriani discusses his rehabilitation, he makes it clear that his recovery has not been quite the traumatic experience that he feared. As soon as it happened, Margot Wells sent a text to say, 'I will make you better when you come back,' and she has been true to her word. After two weeks of lying on his back, keeping his ankle raised, he resumed training. Before long, he was working for two-and-a-half hours a day, six days a week. He used the downtime to correct a shoulder problem that had been bothering him last season. When he was not training, he would look for inspiration in videos of sprinting on YouTube - the classic showdowns between Usain Bolt, Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay - or just beat all-comers on Mario Kart Wii</p> <p>Aware that Cipriani can have a short attention span, friends and family made sure that he was scarcely ever without company for the first two months. 'Sometimes I would get worried and say to my friends, \"Do you think I will be the same?\"' he says. 'And they would tell me to shut up and get on with it. Because that's how it is. I know it sounds harsh, but it's the best way to react to it.'</p> <p>How did he feel when England played the All Blacks, another semi-farcical summer tour that led to Test defeats of 37-20 and 44-12? 'I felt like any England fan would and wanted them to win,' he says. 'I didn't wake up at 8am to watch the games, that's a bit too early for me, but I managed to catch the replay. It must have been a tough tour. You need to have players who could lead, and they had those players out there, but it's difficult because New Zealand had been together for a long time. Whereas the England side was very new. A few people said, \"A bit lucky you missed that tour,\" but I don't feel lucky at all.'</p> <p>At some point in his rehab, however, it started to occur to Cipriani that not only would he be back, but he had the opportunity to return better than before. He began to push his coaches and physios to see what else he could improve. 'I think people will be absolutely shocked when they see him play again,' Wells says. 'You never lose talent, and now he's bigger, stronger and faster. I promise you, I time every run and he's quicker than he was before the injury. All the things he said he wanted to be, he is.'</p> <p>It is clear at the photo shoot, when Cipriani removes his shirt to a roomful of sighs, that he has not spent the summer on the sofa. He is - as Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder has it - as shredded as a julienne salad. Shaun Edwards confirms Margot Wells's assessment. 'The fact that he has bulked up quite a bit, I think his tackling is going to be a lot harder this year as well,' he says. 'He's always been a good tackler, but this year he's going to be a destructive tackler.'</p> <p>Lawrence Dallaglio, who experienced the same injury in New Zealand in 2003 and has been keeping a close eye on Cipriani's progress, believes that he might even now have a mental edge. 'In his position, you feel like you have been given a second chance,' he says. 'Subconsciously it gives you a toughness because you have been through something that quite a few of your competitors haven't. For a sportsman it happens to be injury, but for someone else it might be when they lose someone close to them, but adversity makes you stronger. There's absolutely no doubt that Danny will be stronger as a result of it, both mentally and physically, which must be slightly worrying for the competition.'</p> <p>Cipriani nods, 'It's made me get my love back for the game.'</p> <p>Professionalism has been part of rugby since 1995, but it is hard not to see Danny Cipriani at the vanguard of a new movement in the sport. He is certainly in the first wave of players who could watch the game when they were growing up and think of it, in his case, as a viable alternative to playing football or cricket. Cipriani obviously has ambitions that his fame will reach outside the natural constituency of rugby, which might explain why he was photographed naked last year for Cosmopolitan with just a ball covering his 'tackle'. And how many other players with one international start can boast a clothing arrangement with Giorgio Armani?</p> <p>His nascent relationship with model and actress Kelly Brook will certainly help his notoriety, however long it lasts. Cipriani has often talked of rugby players becoming as high-profile as footballers and, for rugby's newest superstar, anything goes as long as you do not damage the credibility of the game. 'You have responsibilities that you have to uphold,' he says. 'Obviously I made a mistake when I went out that night before the Scotland match, but it's not going to happen again, because I've learned from it. It's not going to stop me being a 20-year-old and having fun, but I think there are certain responsibilities that come with it.'</p> <p>Dallaglio, no stranger to controversy himself, is not worried that Cipriani will lose sight of the prize. 'Danny likes a little bit of the showbiz that goes with rugby, but I can tell you one thing: he won't allow any of that to disrupt his career path,' he says. 'He loves rugby too much to let that happen. He's probably learned some pretty harsh lessons already, but he's not shy of it. I've noticed that he's currently dating a young, attractive lady and he's enjoying himself and good luck to him, why not? He's a young, attractive bloke.'</p> <p>Margot Wells agrees. 'Danny strikes a very good balance between work and play,' she says. 'He doesn't go out and get drunk, he lives at home with his mother so he eats very well. I don't know what kind of food The Ivy serves, but he lives a very balanced lifestyle.'</p> <p>You cannot help wondering if Cipriani realises what impact he could have on the popularity of rugby in this country. How many more people would watch England internationals if they were all as dynamic as the Ireland game? Moreover, isn't it a fact, as new team manager Martin Johnson has acknowledged, that the team have to change? None of the southern-hemisphere nations are intimidated by English muscle; even Argentina look just as big and strong; and Wales would fancy their chances against them any day of the week. Put simply, the rest of the world go to the gym as much as England do these days. </p> <p>'I don't think anyone can change a style of play on their own, but when a team gets the right unity and the right alignment, people know about it,' Cipriani says. 'There's not one player who plays for England who wants it to be a slow, kicking game. Everyone wants to play rugby and score tries and do well. It's about getting the structure in place and that's what Martin Johnson is doing.'</p> <p>First he needs to make a successful comeback from injury and his return to the Wasps first team could come as early as the Premiership game at home against Bath on Wednesday 1 October. Eddie Butler sounds a note of caution. 'There's a blind faith attached to Cipriani because he is so unlike the model of the English player,' he says. 'And it comes with a huge burden, because a) everyone he plays against will recognise that and want to smash shit out of him and b) he's a young kid and as far as anyone can tell he has a flaky side to him, whether it be turning up to a nightclub to deliver tickets or trying to be too extravagant or losing concentration at the peak moment or just getting on one of those rolls where he thinks he can do anything. He does not play without flaws.'</p> <p>It may be premature to expect him to return to the side for England's autumn internationals against Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, which take place in November, just after his 21st birthday, but who knows? Like many of sport's greats, he seems to have a good scriptwriter. Anyway, The Jonny &amp; Danny Show is well and truly back on. 'Having Wilkinson and a number of other players vying for that position will keep him incredibly honest,' Dallaglio says. 'It's a position where we have a number of players who can play well, but, to my mind, when he's on his game, even at the age he's at now, he's the stand-out player of his generation.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on October 5 2008. We said England in 1936 were the first of the home nations to beat New Zealand at rugby, but Wales beat them in 1905 and then again in 1935. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>In a tournament packed with memorable football, one of the best moments of Euro 2008 came almost at the very end. Eighty-two minutes into the final, with Spain looking for a second goal to kill off an outclassed Germany, Marcos Senna, the midfield workhorse of the Spanish team, picked up the ball in his own half and started to run with it. He effortlessly took it round one, two, three static Germans before passing out wide to the right. Then he kept running, and the ball kept moving sweetly through the team, until it came back to him, directly in front of goal, for a tap-in. But Senna, who has never scored for Spain, pulled up at the last moment, seemingly shocked to find himself so far upfield. When the ball arrived he was a yard short and, with a desperate lunge, swung at thin air and missed it altogether. It would have been the goal of the tournament, and a fitting climax for Senna, who was seen by many observers as the unsung hero of Spain's success, the man whose hard graft had allowed all the flair players around him to flourish.</p> <p>But something else stood out about the moment. It drew attention to the fact that there was at least one black player in the final. You may not think such a thing worthy of notice at an international tournament in 2008. But Senna was the only black player on the pitch, as he had been during Spain's semi-final against Russia, and the quarter-final against Italy. Germany's squad contained one black player, David Odonkor, but he arrived at the tournament still recovering from surgery to his right knee and his only contribution to the final came when he trotted up dutifully at the end to collect a loser's medal. The Russian and Italian squads had no black players at all. The same was true of the Croatia side that beat Germany in the group stages, and would probably have beaten them again in the semi-finals had they not already been knocked out on penalties by Turkey. Were it not for the Turks and for Marcos Senna, the latter stages of Euro 2008 would have turned into a whites-only affair.</p> <p>What had happened to the glorious example set by France's World Cup-winning team of 1998, with players of different colours combining to beat the equally diverse Brazilians in the final? Les Bleus seemed to point the way forward towards a new era of multi-ethnic, multicultural teams dominating the big international tournaments. But though the French reached the World Cup final again in 2006, they lost there to an all-white Italy, and at times Euro 2008 seemed to come from a period long before 1998, certainly once France had been knocked out in the group stages and Holland had flopped in the quarter-finals. As the tournament went on, there were fewer and fewer non-white faces to be seen either on the pitch or in the stands (it did not help that the event was taking place in Switzerland and Austria, two countries that have struggled more than most to adapt to racial diversity).</p> <p>It also did not help that England were not there. England have not taken an all-white squad to the finals of a major championship since the 1970 World Cup, though this is partly due to failing to make it to some tournaments (England would have had all-white teams at the 1974 and 1978 World Cups, had they qualified). This time, the all-white Croatia and Russia teams were there at the expense of a highly talented, racially diverse England side. Part of the problem, as so often in the past, was the manager - the somewhat less talented, extremely white Steve McClaren. The current England team are drawn almost exclusively from the Premier League, the most racially and culturally diverse league in Europe. But there was little of that on display at Euro 2008, either.</p> <p>If this tournament was a showcase for the best of European football, then it was of a very different kind from the Champions League final a month earlier. Nine of Chelsea's 18-man squad for that game were black. Manchester United started with three non-white players, with three more on the bench. It is hard to imagine an all-white team competing against the very best European club sides, who draw their talent from all over the world, regardless of race, creed or colour.</p> <p>Take Zenit St Petersburg, the only club in Europe openly to operate a whites-only transfer policy because, according to their coach, the fans would not accept black players in the team. When the Russian club won the 2007-08 Uefa Cup with a team of only white players, their Dutch coach Dick Advocaat admitted that they had reached the peak of what they could hope to achieve. 'The only players who can make Zenit stronger are dark-skinned,' Advocaat said. 'But for us it would be impossible. I would be happy to sign anyone, but the fans don't like black players.' </p> <p>What Advocaat said was shocking, because of his apparent passivity in the face of the fans' racism, but it was also a statement of the obvious. Football is the ultimate globalised business and any barriers that hold up the free movement of labour are being swept away by the competition to acquire the best players from anywhere they can be found. You cannot expect to compete at the highest level if you are going to be fastidious about who plays for your team. When Zenit paid Dynamo Moscow \u20ac30m this summer for Danny Alves, a 25-year-old midfielder who won his first cap for Portugal only in August, it showed how desperate the search for new talent can become if you rule out black players.</p> <p>Of course national-team football is not the same as club football. Countries can only pick players who qualify as national citizens and this inevitably limits the pool from which they can draw. But it does not need to limit it by much. Marcos Senna, for instance, is not Spanish, or at least not very Spanish. He was born and brought up in Brazil, only moving to Spain in 2002 when he joined Villarreal. Four years later, he acquired Spanish citizenship and was immediately included in Spain's squad for the 2006 World Cup.</p> <p>Cynics suggested that Senna had been fast-tracked into the otherwise all-white Spain side as cover for coach Luis Aragon\u00e9s, who had a reputation for less-than-enlightened views on race after he was overheard describing Thierry Henry as a 'black shit'. But Senna was not just there as window-dressing - he was there to strengthen the team. Moreover, according to John Carlin, a long-time observer of Spanish football and of racial politics, Spaniards are not much bothered either by Aragon\u00e9s's slips of the tongue - and Carlin points out that these tend to sound much worse in translation - or by the racial mix of the team. What they want, as all sports fans want, are winners. Senna speaks Spanish with a distinct Brazilian accent, but no one comments, or minds. He belongs to Spain now.</p> <p>Another native Brazilian, had he not been injured, might also have made an impact at Euro 2008. Eduardo, the Arsenal and Croatia centre-forward whose leg had been shattered during a Premier League match in February, might have been the difference between Croatia doing well at Euro 2008 and actually winning it. 'We missed Eduardo,' Slaven Bilic, Croatia's coach, said after his side lost to Turkey. 'Without him, we had problems in finishing.' Eduardo Alves da Silva was born and brought up in Rio de Janeiro, where he was spotted by scouts for Dinamo Zagreb, who brought him to their youth academy as a 16-year-old in 1999. Three years later Eduardo took Croatian citizenship, and two years after that he started playing for the national team. Croatian fans adore him and do not care that he does not look or sound the same as the other players in the team. The view among Croats is that since they found Eduardo and nurtured him, he belongs to them now - if the Brazilians failed to spot his talent, more fool them. Eduardo has returned the compliment by marrying a Croat and happily embracing his new national identity. </p> <p>Croatia's squad at Euro 2008 looked and sounded to the outside world like natural-born Croats. But some of them aren't. Like many of those at the tournament, the players were drawn from all over. Some were born or brought up in Switzerland (Ivan Rakitic, Mladen Petric) or in Germany (Ivan Klasnic, Robert Kovac) and one, Josip Simunic, was born in Australia and trained at the expense of the Australian taxpayer at the Australian Institute of Sport before choosing at the age of 23 to play for Croatia, the country of his parents' birth. Still, the Swiss and the Germans cannot complain. The Switzerland squad had three players of Turkish descent, plus one born in each of Bosnia, Kosovo and Cape Verde. The Germany squad had three players born in Poland (Miroslav Klose, Lukas Podolski, Piotr Trochowski) as well as the Brazil-born Kevin Kuranji, who could have qualified to play for Brazil, Hungary or Panama before finally opting for Germany. Meanwhile, Germans were very conscious that the Turkey team contained Germany-born players (Hamit Altintop, Hakan Balta) who could just as well have been turning out for them. </p> <p>Focusing on the question of race - where were all the black players? - misses the real story of Euro 2008, which is the relentless breaking down of national boundaries as players (and their parents) move across the globe acquiring multiple national identities along the way. This is where the France team of 1998 may have laid a false trail. Behind the celebration of French success was a kind of inverted racism that often lurks behind celebrations of black success in sport.</p> <p>It is often assumed that teams with a higher proportion of black players will inevitably come to dominate football, as they have other sports, particularly in the United States, because of the greater natural athleticism of black players. This is the thought that often lay unspoken behind the idea that a team from Africa were bound to win the World Cup sooner or later. Once African teams got their act together, so the thinking went, there would be no stopping them. The spectacular success in 1998 of a France side with players from Africa and Caribbean territories such as Guadeloupe seemed to confirm that view. When France went on to win Euro 2000, where Germany, with an all-white team, produced the worst performance at a major tournament in their history (even losing to Kevin Keegan's England), coach Erich Ribbeck was heard to muse in fairly impolitic terms about what had gone wrong. 'We just didn't have the colonies,' he said.</p> <p>Ribbeck was not the only person saying the unsayable at the turn of the century. In 1999 American journalist Jon Entine published Taboo: Why Black Athletes Are Better And Why We're Afraid To Talk About It, which tried to address in non-hysterical terms the rise of black athletes across many sports and any possible connection to biology. Entine drew on statistics from sprinting (at the time he was writing, black athletes held 494 of the top 500 fastest 100metres times), long-distance running, which is disproportionately dominated by Kenyans, and American sports more generally, particularly the NBA, where a racial breakdown that had been 80 per cent white and 20 per cent black during the 1960s had become 85 per cent black by the end of the 1990s. Entine also used football to illustrate his thesis that black players have natural advantages. 'The Netherlands national team,' he wrote, 'which made it to the semi-finals in the '98 World Cup, includes stars from Suriname and is about one-third black. France, the winners, has a large contingent of players of African descent.' He went on: 'As the world playing field continues to level, natural abilities are more likely to come to the fore.' By 'natural abilities', Entine meant the abilities of players who are black.</p> <p>But Entine was wrong, and so was Ribbeck. As football has become a more truly globalised sport, it has not come to be dominated by black players, and it turns out that Germany did not need to have had colonies in order to recover from the humiliations of 2000 (what they needed, among other things, was a better manager). Instead, football has come to be dominated by players whose success is not determined by their skin colour, but by their abilities. Thankfully, football is not like the NBA or the NFL, where affluent whites pay to watch athletic blacks. Football is a sport in which greatness can come from all sorts of surprising places and in which all sorts of skills are valued. Who are the greatest football players of the modern era, the top five never mind the top 500? Perhaps Pel\u00e9, Cruyff, Maradona, Zidane, Ronaldo (the black one, not the white one). What have racial stereotypes got to do with that list, except to be mocked by it? Even now, if asked to pick a world XI to take on all-comers, it would be possible to come up with a convincing team consisting entirely of white players (maybe with Torres and Rooney up front, two of the whitest men on the planet), and an equally plausible team of black players (perhaps with Didier Drogba and Samuel Eto'o leading the line). Football is the world's favourite sport in part because it is a sport that can truly transcend racial differences.</p> <p>Kevin Hylton, the author of a new book, 'Race' and Sport: Critical Race Theory, says that it is all too easy to view sport through outdated and naive racial categories, what he calls 'the binary and static categories of black and white'. We need to get beyond this, he says, and see 'just how dynamic and diverse racial and cultural identities can be'. International football increasingly helps to illustrate this, in ways that Entine entirely missed because he was seeing everything through the prism of American sport, where racial identities are invariably reinforced through sport (basketball is a 'black' sport, as ice hockey is a 'white' sport) rather than being broken down by it.</p> <p>It is true that the division is not always black versus white. Before basketball became a black sport, it was seen as a predominantly Jewish sport, because it was the game impoverished Jews invariably chose as a way out of the ghetto. But this socio-cultural explanation did not stop many commentators looking for a biological explanation. 'The reason I suspect that basketball appeals to the Hebrew with his Oriental background,' a writer for the New York Daily News opined in the 1930s, 'is that the game places a premium on an alert, scheming mind, flashy trickiness, artful dodging and general smart aleckness.' It is worth remembering this when commentators say today that blacks dominate basketball because it is a game that values speed and the ability to jump.</p> <p>It is one of the minor tragedies of American history that the country never properly embraced 'soccer', a sport that might have been best equipped to cut across some of the static and binary racial divisions of American society. When Jon Entine published Taboo, he agreed to take part in a discussion with the Reverend Jesse Jackson on CNN. This was brave of him, and the exchange was not a happy one. Jackson was furious with Entine for reinforcing racial prejudice rather than looking at all the social forces that combine to distort the level playing field of sport. For Jackson, basketball was a sport that did not so much favour black athletes as pigeonhole them. </p> <p>Entine accepted that cultural factors play a large part in determining which sports attract which sorts of athletes, but insisted that to turn a blind eye to the biological differences was simply to ignore the facts. He also acknowledged that it was a mistake to reduce everything to the simple binary of black versus white - the black athletes who dominate sprinting, for example, are of West African descent, whereas the long-distance runners are invariably East African. 'I don't believe in the concept of race, Reverend Jackson,' Entine insisted, 'and I don't think blacks can be lumped into one population because of skin colour.' </p> <p>But Jackson was having none of it. 'The one thing I'm convinced of,' he declared by way of conclusion, 'is whenever the playing field is even, the rules are public, the goals are clear, and there is a work ethic, we all do exceptionally well.'</p> <p>What Jackson needed to prove his case was the example of football, where what he says is demonstrably true. Of course, football has had more than its share of racism and stereotyping blighting the chances of players from different ethnic backgrounds, but when the playing field is even, then anyone can succeed. Kevin Hylton's book has on its cover one of the most famous of all football photographs, the embrace between Pel\u00e9 and Bobby Moore after the Brazil v England game at the 1970 World Cup. Both men are stripped to the waist, both smiling, both displaying an obvious mutual respect. They have different physiques, Pel\u00e9 shorter and more muscular, the blond and pale-skinned Moore taller, skinnier, slightly less athletic-looking. 'I had serious doubts about putting this picture on the cover,' Hylton tells me. 'It's the ultimate binary image, black against white. Also I don't want people to forget the racism that Pel\u00e9 suffered throughout his career, from inside Brazil as well as from the outside world.' Still, it is a wonderful photograph, because of what it says about the scope football provides for players of different types to excel, and to compete on equal terms. There is a similarly celebrated basketball photo from the late 1980s, which shows the black Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls and the white Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics facing each other, cautiously but with mutual respect, as befits the two premier players of their era. But that photo seems to come from another age, and to mark the passing of basketball from an era in which one type of player could excel to an era that would favour another. Jordan versus Bird seems to belong to the past, whereas Pel\u00e9 versus Moore is a timeless confrontation in football terms.</p> <p>The peerless Brazil team of 1970 contained players of every different shade of skin. But it also symbolised the racism that lurks in the background of all sports, including football, including in Brazil. The goalkeeper of that team - F\u00e9lix - was white, because Brazil did not pick black goalkeepers, a result of prejudices that lingered on from the disaster of the 1950 World Cup final, which Brazil lost unexpectedly to Uruguay. As David Goldblatt writes in his magnificent history of global football, The Ball Is Round: 'When the time for recriminations did come, the scapegoats were the left-half Bigode, defender Juvenal and goalkeeper Barbosa. All were condemned in the press as cowards, lacking fibre and discipline - and all three were black. Barbosa was singled out for special levels of opprobrium which endured until his poverty-stricken death 50 years later.' Brazil did not pick a black goalkeeper until Dida in 1995. As Goldblatt says of 1950: 'The multiracial, confident, progressive Brazil that [had been] conjured from football was dissolved in an acid bath of racism, self-doubt and self-loathing.'</p> <p>Skin colour matters in football not because of what it says about the abilities of the players, but because of what it can say about the distorted perspectives of people who do not play the game but merely watch it, or administer it, or finance it. Some countries have started looking to Africa to bolster their national teams by encouraging players to change nationality in return for the greater rewards on offer. This is not because African players are naturally better. It is because African players are often more vulnerable to these sorts of offers, and more easily exploited by anyone willing to be unscrupulous about whom they recruit.</p> <p>Tom Vernon, the Manchester United scout in Africa and founder of the Right To Dream football academy in Ghana, says 'the continent is currently being swept for talent' by some national federations looking to naturalise promising young players. The most conspicuous example of this is Qatar, whose Aspire academy has a large budget devoted to hosting trials in every country in Africa with a view to offering the resources of the Qatari Football Federation to the best they can find, and with the prospect of Qatari citizenship included. The attractions of this arrangement for young African players are obvious, particularly when they come from impoverished countries that lack a clear national identity in football terms, or are held back by a corrupt national federation in the country of their birth. 'Still,' Vernon says, 'it's outrageous what's going on.' The ultimate aim of the Qataris is to have a properly competitive team at the 2014 World Cup, though what that will mean in practice is a team that is almost entirely of African origin, with little or no connection to Qatar itself beyond what the Aspire academy has given them. </p> <p>But it is not just the Qataris - other countries have started to fast-track the naturalisation of African players, including some of the smaller European nations. The main motivation here tends to come from big European club sides, particularly in England, who want African players with European Union passports in order to get round potential problems with work permits. The easiest way to do this is to farm the players out to feeder clubs in Benelux or Scandinavian countries, where they can acquire a passport after a brief period of residency, and then be available to move to the UK. But, as Vernon says: 'This also provides a chance for these countries to transform the make-up of their national teams. In some ways, places like Luxembourg are missing an opportunity here.' But if they take that opportunity, they risk a backlash from their own fans, never mind those of other countries, including the African countries of origin of their new players, given the mockery this would make of the idea of belonging to a national team.</p> <p>When it works well, as it has in the cases of Marcos Senna and Eduardo, the naturalisation of overseas players can be a force for good, breaking down prejudices and broadening horizons. But it needs to be handled carefully. The Poles have a record of fast-tracking foreigners into the national team - they did it with Nigeria-born Emmanuel Olisadebe before qualifying for the 2002 World Cup, and they did it again before Euro 2008, with Brazil-born Roger Guerreiro transformed into a Pole just two months before the finals, having only been in the country since 2006. Not only did this smack of desperation, but it stirred up nationalist sentiment in a country where race relations are fragile at best. The racism of some fans should not be a reason for holding back when selecting the best players to turn out for Poland, any more than it should hold back Zenit St Peterburg in the transfer market, but clumsy attempts to play the system can help to generate intolerance instead of overcoming it.</p> <p>What is important, though, is to see that this is not about race, whatever the racists may like to think. It is about the changing face of national identity. The next World Cup will take place in South Africa in 2010. It is not inconceivable that the final could be contested by an all-white European team and an all-black African one. That could appear, in South Africa of all places, to be a retrograde step. But it need be nothing of the sort. It would be a sign that good football teams can be any colour. If an African side do finally win the tournament in 2010, it will not be because Africans are naturally more talented, but simply because the rest of the world have finally allowed the African continent home advantage, the single most important factor in determining the winner of World Cups. </p> <p>Moreover, as Kevin Hylton says, 'we need to look beyond \"whiteness\" and \"blackness\" to see all the diversity that lies behind those static categories'. All-black African teams are no more homogenous than all-white European ones. Players move, their parents move, and countries often naturalise players born or brought up elsewhere. 'West Africa is not so different from Europe,' Tom Vernon says. The boundaries between some of the strongest African teams - Nigeria, Togo, Ghana, Cameroon - can be as fluid as they are in Europe when it comes to player registration and the best sides are often the ones that draw on the widest pool of talent.</p> <p>What about England? To qualify for 2010, England need to emerge from a group with Croatia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Andorra. The England team are long used to suffering racial abuse in eastern Europe and this group looks pretty ominous in that respect - Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan have never fielded a black player between them. During the team's 4-1 win in Zagreb in early September, Emile Heskey was targeted by some in the crowd - with Eduardo out injured, things may be slipping back in Croatia. </p> <p>England have always led the way in fielding multiracial teams - ever since Viv Anderson was first picked in 1978 - but, in some other respects, they are starting to be left behind. Other major European national teams are looking to register players with multiple nationalities as young as possible in their national federations. The Polish FA are trawling German youth teams for possible Poland players of the future. The Germans, realising what they have missed out on, are now actively recruiting among the Turkish community. In Spain, a battle has long been under way for one of the world's most talented teenagers, Barcelona's Bojan Krkic, son of a Serbian footballer and a Spanish nurse. Krkic is a product of the Barcelona youth system that also developed Lionel Messi, a player many Spaniards wish they had claimed as their own after he moved from Argentina at the age of 13.</p> <p>The big English clubs are not in the habit of searching the world for young talent to train up in Britain; instead, they buy in established players from abroad, whose national affiliation is invariably already fixed. So the national team have fewer opportunities to look outside home-grown communities for future England players. But the new influx of immigrants from eastern Europe means that, too, may be about the change. Will the English FA also soon be in competition with the Polish FA to secure talented teenagers born there but brought up here? Like everyone else, the England team are going to have to try to broaden their talent base in any way they can. The current England team member who probably best reflects the sort of diversity we should get used to in the future is Owen Hargreaves, who was born in Canada to a Welsh mother and an English father, and moved to Germany with Bayern Munich at the age of 16, where he remained until his transfer to Manchester United last year. Hargreaves is white, but he is a lot less English than any of the non-white players who have appeared for England over the past 30 years. Almost nothing about the future of international football is simply black and white any more. </p> <h2>Double Identities: The teams they could have played for</h2> <p><strong>Manuel Almunia</strong> Spain and England </p> <p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa </strong>DR Congo and Portugal</p> <p><strong>Jean-Alain Boumsong</strong> Cameroon and France</p> <p><strong>Philippe Senderos</strong> Spain, Serbia and Switzerland</p> <p><strong>Patrice Evra</strong> Senegal and France</p> <p><strong>Colin Kazim-Richards</strong> England and Turkey</p> <p><strong>Patrick Vieira</strong> Cape Verde, Senegal and France</p> <p><strong>Owen Hargreaves </strong>Wales, Canada, England and Germany</p> <p><strong>Gabriel Agbonlahor</strong> England, Nigeria and Scotland</p> <p><strong>Zlatan Ibrahimovic</strong> Bosnia, Croatia and Sweden</p> <p><strong>Kevin Kuranyi</strong> Brazil, Panama, Hungary and Germany</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> David Runciman's essay on 'Home Advantage' appeared in February's OSM</p>",
  "<p>Formula One hopes to enter a bright, new future this afternoon when Felipe Massa leads 20 cars away from the grid at the start of the first grand prix to be held at night. Massa mastered not only the 23 corners of the impressive Marina Bay circuit, but the Ferrari driver also successfully brought the first two days of running under floodlights - and in front of packed grandstands - to a hugely satisfactory conclusion.</p> <p>The Brazilian, quietly playing himself in during the two nights of practice and qualifying, produced a stunning lap when it mattered to equal his pole position under similar conditions at Monaco to beat Lewis Hamilton, this time by more than half a second. With four races remaining, Hamilton leads Massa by one point in the championship.</p> <p>'The car was just perfect,' said Massa. 'It was very nice to drive and then I managed to do a perfect lap and not make any mistakes. Coming into the last corner, you know that everything can go wrong. I had taken it corner by corner and I tried to take it easy at the last corner - but I couldn't. The car was going so well.'</p> <p>Hamilton had no answer at the end of what had been, for him, a scrappy qualifying session, the Englishman making it into the final-10 shoot-out by fractions of a second. Indeed, Hamilton's potential embarrassment for the second race in succession was probably saved by Fernando Alonso, who was forced to pull up with what was euphemistically described by Renault as a 'fuel supply problem'.</p> <p>'It was a little bit nerve wracking and definitely not as smooth sailing as we had hoped,' said Hamilton. 'It was tricky to choose the correct tyre: both were similar but the soft one does not seem to be lasting for the whole lap.'</p> <p>Kimi Raikkonen lost vital time during morning practice when he was forced to stop with gearbox trouble, the Ferrari driver looking as ambivalent as usual after eventually qualifying third.</p> <p>The novelty value produced by the Singapore circuit has deflected comment - much of it adverse - following the court case in Paris last Monday when an appeal against Hamilton's penalty in the Belgian Grand Prix was declared inadmissible. In one predictable move, the sport's governing body, the FIA, sidestepped the need to explain anomalies in their procedures although the inescapable detail of the case appeared to undermine the previously respected authority of the Charlie Whiting, the FIA's race director.</p> <p>Whiting has not been in as much demand as expected this weekend as the teams come to terms with a completely new environment. Such is the complex nature of converting a city's thoroughfares into a race track that new venues rarely receive full approval. Singapore's wide-spread acceptance by a highly critical audience is adequate testimony to the thought and effort put into not only a long and difficult track, but also one that is breaking further new ground by being used as dusk gathers each evening.</p> <p>Street circuits, by their very nature, present problems because the road surface has a crown to aid drainage, unlike completely flat purpose-built tracks. With the aerodynamic efficiency of F1 cars increasing in direct proportion to how close to the ground they are run, there have been the predictable complaints from drivers about the track being too bumpy. Equally true to form, some teams have dealt with this natural hazard better than others.</p> <p>'Yes, the track is bumpy,' said Hamilton. 'But, for me, the bumps were only serious at the start of practice on Friday. They have to be dealt with and we seem to be coping OK now. It's not because our car necessarily rides the bumps better than anyone else. It seems that some cars are bottoming [running low and hitting the road] more than others.'</p> <p>Even if McLaren have found a better solution, the bumpy surface will add to the physical punishment dealt out by 61 laps this afternoon. The 1,600 floodlights - reputedly bringing four times more illumination than the best lighting in a sports stadium - have produced only a few areas of shadow that have caused some concern among a few drivers.</p> <p>'They've done an incredible job,' said Hamilton. 'The circuit has a lot of character and is really challenging. You feel you are going through the streets of a city. I don't think the lights are having an adverse physical effect. Maybe you have to focus more but that's probably because it's such a busy lap. It's like Monaco and a half. The corners come one after another and the bumpy ride will not be helped by the high temperature. It's so hot in the car and the problem is, there's no breeze coming in anywhere. It's going to be a very tough race, that's for sure.' </p> <p>'The track is tough,' agreed Massa. 'It's really, really difficult to get every corner right. Concentration will be 10 times more important than a normal circuit and even more difficult than at Monaco. But this is a very important race for F1. People seem very interested in what happens. In Brazil the fans will have to get up early. I'm looking forward to giving them something worth watching.'</p>",
  "<p>Theo Walcott, Rebecca Adlington, Tom Daley, Laura Robson, Louis Smith - this year's list of stellar sporting achievers has a distinctly teenage theme. In the past 10 days alone 14-year-old Olympian diver Daley has won two junior world championship silver medals, while Robson won three matches on her way to the semi-finals of her first professional British tennis tournament. Adlington is the bookies' red-hot favourite to win this year's BBC Sports Personality of the Year award, and even the junior award looks likely to be one hell of a contest. </p> <p>'They are coming through earlier than ever before, and with a higher profile. Certainly in my time I haven't seen anything like it,' says BBC director of sport Roger Mosey. </p> <p>As much as sports governing bodies will want to take the plaudits, this has to be an occasion where parents take the headlines. Ask young sports stars how they have achieved so much and they will relay stories of parents ferrying them to training and back, making sacrifices in their personal lives, working hard to support them, and in some cases - such as Walcott's father Don and Adlington's mother Kay - even giving up their jobs. </p> <p>Don Walcott famously quit his job with British Gas when his employers refused to give him time off to watch Theo's professional debut for Southampton in 2005. He had not missed any of his son's matches before then and was darned if he was going to miss this one. The family were forced to rely on the single earnings of Theo's mum Lynn, a midwife, but when Theo scored that night, his dad said it was the best decision he had ever made. </p> <p>Adlington's mum had to give up her job when Becky, aged 13, began training with coach Bill Furniss in Nottingham, 25 miles from their home in the east midlands town of Mansfield. 'It was a really tough time for us,' says Kay, 'My husband's business was struggling, and all three of our girls were on different swim teams. Managing it all was like a military operation. Driving Becky to the pool at 5am, watching her train, taking her home, then to school, then back to training, was a full-time job in itself and I was still doing the payroll for my husband's business.' </p> <p>Being driven by mum is something familiar to another teenaged star, gymnast Louis Smith, 19, who won bronze on the pommel horse in Beijing. 'She gave me lifts at all hours every day to the gym so I could train and she made sure that she had enough money to help me out with little things when I was totally broke. She has been my inspiration. Without her, I would not be here,' Smith said of his mother, Elaine, recently</p> <p>There are plenty of sacrifices to be made, but the Adlingtons would not let their daughters' swimming be one of them. 'Steve and I come from working-class backgrounds. When you've had nothing you learn to go without, you think, \"Ok we won't go out for meals, we'll spend that money on the girls.\" We didn't have much of a social life, but after all those early mornings you wouldn't want to go out on a Saturday night anyway.'</p> <p>Adlington proved adept at swimming aged four, when she jumped into a pool on holiday despite never having swum before. 'We just froze and held our breath, but she came back up and swam to the side. We looked at each other and said, \"This girl needs swimming lessons\".'</p> <p>The family got involved with their local pool, Sherwood Colliery Swimming Club, now to be renamed after Adlington. All three girls swam there and Kay worked there as an assistant coach teaching young children. 'It was something we did as a family. It was a nice environment and Becky loved it, she was always happiest in the pool.' Aged 12, Becky cleaned up at the national championships and the family then realised she had potential. Still they never pushed her. </p> <p>'From the beginning we said to our daughters, \"The minute you stop enjoying swimming you stop.\" A lot of people think we must be obsessed for Becky to have achieved what she has, but we're not. Becky just loves it. Someone said to me, \"You've got her where she is.\" I got annoyed with that because I haven't got her anywhere, I drove her to training but she got in the pool and achieved it herself. We've just been the team behind her.'</p> <p>It is a common assumption that any young sporting achiever must have 'pushy parents'; the more precocious the talent the more the suspicion is piled on. Sitting in their kitchen in Plymouth, mum Debbie and dad Rob are well used to such inferences. 'People probably think all sorts of things,' says Rob, 'that we're right stuck up, or rich to the back teeth, but we're just normal people.' </p> <p>'Someone said about us being pushy parents because Rob videos Tom's competitions,' says Debbie. 'But if your child was in a school play you'd record them, wouldn't you? We don't video it and play it back to Tom saying, \"This is where you went wrong...\" It's just a nice record.</p> <p>'I would say Tom's a pushy athlete, he's the one stood at the door with his rucksack saying, \"Come on, we're gonna be late.\" I don't know where he gets that from, Rob's always late. We were due to get married at 1.15pm and he didn't get in the shower until ten to one.'</p> <p>The media interest in young sports stars is one of the more difficult challenges for the parents. From hysteria to criticism, there is a wide spectrum of opinion. When Robson, 14, won the Wimbledon junior title this summer, the bookies were immediately calculating odds on her winning the senior competition next year. Similarly, observers began carping on about a fall from grace before she had even turned professional. The response from Laura's agent has been to protect her and her family, turning down interview requests, concerned about the hype. </p> <p>At times it must feel like a no-win situation. In Beijing Tom Daley was criticised for naming sponsors at his press conference, something that shocked his parents. 'We've always taught him to be polite,' says Rob. 'He was just thanking them for making the trip nicer, it was common courtesy - they're not even his sponsors.' He sighs. 'Some people just see pound signs. I've always told Tom not to listen to the rubbish people come out with.'</p> <p>In the garage is Tom's 'scrapbook', a library of all his newspaper cuttings meticulously collated by Rob. The coverage has increased markedly; May 2008 fills a whole thick file, goodness knows how many he will need for August. 'Tom probably thinks I'm a nutter,' says Rob, 'but when he's older he might like to look back on things.' For now Tom is refreshingly uninterested. 'I don't like to read about myself,' he says, 'I find it weird. I think of other people being in the paper, not me.' </p> <p>Still, he has had to get used to fame, being stopped in the street for photographs, receiving letters from around the world. Many are addressed simply as, 'Tom Daley, Olympian, Plymouth'. 'It's like Father Christmas,' says Debbie. </p> <p>He has developed a fine autograph. 'Yeah, Tonia Couch [training partner] designed it for me,' says Tom. 'She said, \"Oi you're going to have to learn autographs,\" and I was like well I don't know how. That was a few years ago, messing around. So she made me one, then I actually ended up needing to use it.' He pulls a face, as though the world has gone crazy. </p> <p>Do Tom's parents worry about how much media attention has been generated? 'Not particularly,' says Debbie. 'A lot of it you can control, you can say no. Tom's always had good reviews anyway apart from all the hassle with Blake [Aldridge], but that was more about Blake than Tom, although I'm sure there'll be a day when there are [negative] things written about him.'</p> <p>'I always work on the ethic that you be good to the media and they'll have no reason to turn against you,' says Rob. 'The day they do, that'll be the end of talking to that newspaper. Still, I'm fully aware of what some newspapers can do. We have turned down offers of money for all sorts. Generally it's common sense. I ran a business for many years and I can suss people out.'</p> <p>While the Daleys are used to media interest - Tom's first appearance on TV came when he was 10 - for the Adlingtons the attention was a shock. 'We didn't handle it very well,' says Kay, 'we didn't know how to. After Becky's first gold medal so many people were ringing the house - 11 satellite trucks turned up outside. My daughter Laura counted eight television crews queuing in our hallway, the first turned up at 6.45 in the morning and the last one left just before 10 at night. And then they came again the next day. We were out of our depth. We hadn't eaten, it was too much. We were still trying to take in Becky's achievements. </p> <p>'Even now when I think about it, it's scary that Becky's being mentioned in the same bracket as Theo Walcott. I mean footballers are internationally known. In all honesty you don't think about your own daughter like that. To us she's just Becky, the same girl who loves chocolate cake, shoes, old-fashioned sweets and curling up on the sofa to watch a DVD.'</p> <p>Unprepared for the media onslaught, the Adlingtons wished they could have had some advice. 'We should have said, \"Do you mind if we have a break?\" but we didn't feel we could. Who are we? I'm just a mum who's taken her daughter swimming. Now I walk round Tesco's and everyone knows who I am. Eventually we learned to say no, but it ought to change. There should be advice and support for the families. If someone gave us a ring and said, \"This is what's going to happen, prepare for it,\" it would have helped. For 2012 we need to train our young people to win medals, but also to deal with what happens afterwards.'</p> <p>The Adlingtons and the Daleys agree that maintaining a 'normal' family life has been important. Becky missed out on parties and night-clubbing as a teenager but her parents made sure her friends came over for DVDs and pizza. There is also an emphasis on looking after all of their children; while Rob Daley brings Tom to the pool six days a week, Debbie takes their younger sons, Will and Ben, to rugby and football, and the whole family watch all three of their sons play sport. </p> <p>Anyone who wonders whether Tom is prematurely bypassing childhood has only to spend five minutes in the Daley house. The three boys play 'Rockband' together in the front room, and while eating dinner they push their cottage pie around their plates,. Tom gets excited about sending Dip Dabs to his diving friends in America. 'They tried them and they were like, \"Oh my god, these are yummy.\" They're sending me some surprise American sweets back.'</p> <p>For both families, life-threatening illness brought them closer together - Rob had a tumour in his brain removed in May 2006, while Laura, the middle daughter, was on a life support machine after glandular fever infected her brain four years ago. Becky also had the disease, though in a milder form. The family were rocked by the episode. 'It was an agonising time,' says Kay, 'Becky seeing her sister in intensive care, fighting for her life, she must have asked herself the question, \"Will it do this to me?\" On the advice of her coach she kept up gentle training, and we monitored her closely for any change in mood, or appetite. While we sat in the hospital Chloe, the eldest, took Becky training. The whole family chipped in.'</p> <p>The family values of the Adlingtons are clear. Sporting victories, sponsorship deals and parental pride are all very nice, but the family bond comes first. 'We learned a lot from that time,' says Kay. 'It's all too easy to be materialistic, wanting nice shoes - in Becky's case - or medals, but family really is the most important thing.' </p> <p>Therein lies the secret to well-balanced individuals, and the added bonus of sporting success.</p>",
  "<p>Calling the possible rescue package offered to Wall Street a case of \"crybaby capitalism,\" <a href=\"http://www.opednews.com/articles/Naomi-Klein-The-Bomb-Has-by-Rady-Ananda-080922-453.html\">Naomi Klein has suggested</a> the economic meltdown might prove a window of opportunity for political opportunists seeking to force economy austerity measures on a gobsmacked and demoralised public.</p> <p>It's a classic case of \"disaster capitalism\", defined by Klein in the <a href=\"http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine\">Shock Doctrine</a> as \"orchestrated raids on the public sphere in the wake of catastrophic events, combined with the treatment of disasters as exciting market opportunities\".</p> <p>In a recent article in the Spectator magazine, political columnist <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/print/the-magazine/features/2172111/welcome-to-the-new-austerity-era-mr-cameron.thtml\">Fraser Nelson illustrates this logic</a>, suggesting the Tory party should embrace the bright side of the catastrophe: \"The global financial crisis has transformed the political context and left an opening for the Conservatives to promise true radicalism and to be proudly bold.\" </p> <p>David Cameron must jump, Nelson suggests, on this promising financial Armageddon. He must abandon the temptation to adopt a \"safety first\" mentality, and expose how the crisis has resulted from wasteful public spending by Labour, and that the only solution is greater economic austerity. <br>Nelson indicates there is some hesitation among Tories about how overtly the crisis should be exploited. Some are feeling sensitive to the level of financial unease in the nation. \"The issue of whether champagne should be served at the next Black &amp; White Christmas ball, for example, has been discussed at the very highest levels.\" </p> <p>Perhaps sensitive to this caution, Nelson offers no specific financial strategies, just advises Cameron to stay strong and to strive to expose the popular \"myth\" now propagated by leftists: the idea that the future will inevitably be one of \"higher regulation and more government\".</p> <p>Nelson does have one point. The only thing more troubling than the thought of predatory traders circulating around banks such as HBOS, profiting from rumours of their destitution, is the thought of repentant liberals circulating around Marx, begging like cheating lovers to be taken back.</p> <p>Crises always make strange bedfellows, but rarely have so many leapt at the chance to bed the same fellow. Some of the suitors are more unlikely than others. It's hard at first to grasp what buttons Marx pushes for a man like Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury. </p> <p>Marx did suggest <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_of_the_people\">\"religion is the opiate of the people</a>\", which implies a man in William's position is a sort of well-heeled crack dealer, which one would think might be a deal-breaker. Williams, though, has looked past such indelicacies, suggesting that, if wrong about everything else, the German expat was right about one thing: \"Marx long ago observed the way in which unbridled capitalism became a kind of mythology, ascribing reality, power and agency to things that had no life in themselves.\"</p> <p>Williams is perhaps alluding to concepts such as \"alienated labour\", which Marx describes as the tendency of workers to be misled into viewing their own labour as a product alien to themselves. The conception of alienation is related to \"false consciousness\", where workers are unaware they are subject to ideological controls that foster their exploitation. Unfortunately for Williams, this is one area where Marx misses the ball. </p> <p>The problem \u2013 one that few commentators on the left or right have acknowledged during the recent crisis \u2013 is that there is nothing particularly deceptive or even \"mythological\" about the roots of the current crisis. It has been created through the willingness of traders and financiers to legally exploit market mechanisms, which are for the most part, troublingly transparent \u2013 not hidden, as Marx suggests.</p> <p>For evidence of this you only have to turn to some of capitalism's most celebrated heroes and heroines, such as <a href=\"http://www.georgesoros.com/\">George Soros</a>, who has long professed bafflement over why more people don't curb the excesses of people like him. Soros, together with market enthusiasts such as <a href=\"http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/\">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a>, have long pointed out predatory behavior such as short-selling is not an aberration. It's the raison d'\u00eatre of capitalism. \"I call them crisis hunters,\" writes Taleb of those who profit from market volatility. \"I am happy to be among them.\" Taleb wrote this in his bestselling <a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141031484,00.html\">Fooled by Randomness</a>, a book that has become both a bible and an operating guide to many financiers and investors.</p> <p>What's troubling about this is not the realisation that capitalists profit from speculating about \u2013 and therefore generating \u2013 the financial combustion of their competitors, but that this is striking so many people as shocking. What it's even more troubling is that, perhaps in order to explain why they hadn't really noticed it going on, observers such as Williams are suggesting such behaviour takes place in a shady, illusory, deceptive manner. </p> <p>When you call capitalism a mythology, you ascribe to it the very mystical, elusive authority that should be challenged if capitalism is to be made more equitable. Rather than Marx, sceptics should turning to some of capitalism's most successful practitioners such as Soros. These individuals are not alchemists. Their fortunes have not been generated through some sort of magic trick, but through the far more pedestrian act of exploiting capitalism's logic.</p>",
  "<p>As part of her \"meet the ineffectual world leaders\" parade to miraculously understand the complexities of modern day geopolitics in less than 40 days, Sarah Palin had a lively interaction with recently elected Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, in New York. </p> <p>It's both surreal and frightening that these two upstart political figures could very well be significant actors in deciding the fate of modern, global relations. It's fitting that the neophytes met in such an awkward and theatrical fashion. </p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/24/pakistans-president-tells-palin-she-is-gorgeous/\">CNN report</a>, upon entering the room filled with sycophantic Pakistani officials, Palin was first slobbered over by the country's information minister, Sherry Rehman: </p> <p>\"And how does one keep looking that good when one is that busy?\" Rehman asked when complimenting Palin.</p> <p>\"Oh, thank you,\" Palin said.</p> <p>Not to be outdone, Zardari, the widowed husband of the assassinated Benazir Bhutto, called Palin \"gorgeous\" and then remarked: \"Now I know why the whole of America is crazy about you.\"</p> <p>Although some of this hyperbolic flattery is common in elitist social circles in Pakistan, one is hard pressed to find the historical precedent for the following exchange. When Zardari's aide told the two politicians to keep shaking hands for the cameras, Zardari remarked: </p> <p>\"If he's insisting, I might hug.\" </p> <p>Palin smiled politely. Much to Zardari's dismay, no hug took place. </p> <p>And with his flagrant display of sleaze-ball rhetoric, Zardari unwittingly symbolised the turbulent and twisted relationship between the US and its volatile, erstwhile lover Pakistan. One partner actively and shamelessly covets nearness, while the other selfishly exploits these lustful pangs for myopic policy initiatives. The reader can cast the appropriate roles.</p> <p>To those following the circus that is Pakistani politics, they undoubtedly know of last year's power-sharing deal brokered by the US between the then president, Pervez Musharraf and the late Bhutto, who was supposed to become Pakistan's prime minister. Realising their dictator of choice, Musharraf, was losing sway and popularity, the Bush administration hoped Bhutto would step in, allay growing social discontent, and be a more suitable [read: compliant] partner in the relentless and misguided \"war on terror\". The tragic assassination of Bhutto in December unfortunately allowed a power vacuum to develop, one that is now filled by the most unexpected actor: Zardari.</p> <p>In order to facilitate the brokered relationship with Bhutto, Santa Musharraf gave Zardari the best Christmas present of all time in the form of the 2007 <a href=\"http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/2007/NationalReconciliationOrdinance.html\">National Reconciliation Ordinance</a>. This was a loathsome piece of Machiavellian legislation that granted amnesty to politicians, bureaucrats and political workers accused of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder and terrorism. Naturally, Chief Justice Chaudhry suspended the unlawful ordinance, only to be later suspended himself by Musharraf on trumped up and vague \"corruption charges\". Zardari was the most deserving recipient of this delightful ordinance. As of last year, he was embroiled in several, massive corruption cases in more than four different countries, none of which were vague, figments of dictatorial fantasy. </p> <p>Thankfully for Zardari, Christmas seems to have come twice this year, since millions held in Zardari's Swiss funds have just been released after the dropped corruption charges, thereby making Zardari one of the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4629017.ece\">richest men</a> in Pakistan. He is unique amongst billionaires for making his magical fortune with no semblance of a legitimate job or a functioning business. </p> <p>It should comfort the US that the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a5a961e2-72e3-11dd-983b-0000779fd18c,dwp_uuid=f39ffd26-4bb2-11da-997b-0000779e2340.html\">Financial Times</a> reported their chosen ally in Pakistan was diagnosed last year \"with a range of serious illnesses including dementia, major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder in a series of medical reports spanning more than two years\". Coincidentally, at this time last year Zardari was supposed to make appearances at a UK court to challenge pending corruption charges against him in multiple countries. Recently, a spokesperson for Zardari rebuffed these assertions and declared him to be fully recovered and well. </p> <p>Zardari should be heralded as a medical phenomenon and toured across the globe. Who knew the cure for dementia, depression and PTSD was obtaining the post of president of Pakistan? </p> <p>With a deadly terrorist bomb blast at the Islamabad Marriott killing nearly 60 last week and a marked increase in suicide blasts inside Pakistan's borders, one can only hope the US learns from the error of its siding with thugs, thieves and dictators in Pakistan for the past 30 years or thereabouts. Instead, the administration, and even the Democrats, is now siding with Zardari, a known felon and thief, who \u2013 if we are to believe his own doctors \u2013 was suicidal and incoherent just a year ago. Yet, we seem doomed to repeat a myopic policy in yet another desperate attempt to aggressively pursue terrorists hiding within the North-West Frontier province Pakistan-Afghanistan border. </p> <p>If Zardari still harbours those same psychological demons, a surefire politically suicidal move would be to unconditionally support Bush's recent, shortsighted \"offensive\" policy; one that directly threatens Pakistan's sovereignty and emboldens the militants within its borders. Unfortunately, in my recent <a href=\" http://www.altmuslim.com/a/a/e/2815/]\">interview with Howard Dean</a> it seems the Democrats would follow suit in order to hunt al-Qaida and appear strong in the \"war on terror\". Instead, this policy should be thoroughly re-examined and critically questioned in order to avoid a massive, inevitable blowback, further destabilising an already fragile nation state with access to nuclear weapons. </p> <p>If anything, it would temporarily diffuse the rampant anger and disgust proliferating amongst the Pakistani people. Many who believe the US is merely installing and supporting, via a sham-democratic process, yet another puppet to serve its own interests. </p> <p>Although it is obvious Zardari wants hug his \"partner\" close, nuzzling comfortably in its bosom, the question remains: how does America hug back?</p>",
  "<p>On Sunday when he addresses the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, London mayor Boris Johnson will be hugged to the bosom of the very body whose mothering milk he no longer imbibes. By accident, design and both, The Blond has become detached from the breast that gave him new political life. The bright but hapless junior celeb urged into the mayoral race last year has now got <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hair-Funny-Places-Babette-Cole/dp/0099266261\">hair in funny places</a> \u2013 don't press me on the details \u2013 a big, deep voice and a home all of his own. </p> <p>It has not been a painless parting. The disentangling of Johnson's young regime from Tory HQ's apron strings has been part comedy of errors, part power struggle and not wholly conducive to putting policy into rapid effect. The transition team of consultants installed to smooth the transfer of power was first depleted by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/23/london.race\">loss of James McGrath</a> thanks to a crass remark, then sapped of credibility by Nick Boles's <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23520233-details/Boris+Johnson+aide+takes+the+blame+for+failure+to+vet+Lewis/article.do\">admission</a> that there'd been no time to check the credentials of Ray Lewis, Johnson's deputy for young people who was <a href=\"http://jamescleverly.blogspot.com/2008/07/ray-lewis-resigns.html\">forced to resign</a> under a cloud of scandal. The loss of Lewis was itself a kind of break with Tory central: Johnson had adopted him, but David Cameron had done the same thing long before. </p> <p>The decisive breach, though, came with the <a href=\"http://labourboy.wordpress.com/2008/08/19/to-the-prince-of-darkness-begone-tim-parker-resigns/\">departure of Tim Parker</a>, the ruthless asset-stripper placed at the head of the GLA Group to, in his own words, \"run the place\" on the mayor's behalf. Parker is a mate of Tory bigwig <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/person/0,,-3429,00.html\">Francis Maude</a>. He was installed to bring fat-slashing private sector rigour to a bureaucracy held by common Tory consent to be bloated and bursting with waste. Within a few weeks he was gone, effectively levered out, many believe, by Sir Simon Milton, Johnson's planning adviser. Certainly, this former leader of Westminster City Council, knighted for his services to local government, is not a fellow who would take kindly to being bossed about by some unelected private equity buccaneer.</p> <p>Sir Simon has emerged empowered from the embarrassing debris of transition. He is the force behind a planned restructuring, revealed in a document called <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/speeches/20080910-future.jsp\">Organising for Delivery</a>. A suitable subtitle might be Better Late Than Never, I Suppose. Meanwhile, Johnson himself has become more hands-on, taking the chair of the board of Transport for London that Parker was lined up to occupy. Officially, the mayor had recognised that the political nature of decisions taken there required a man with a mandate to preside. Voices off say that the upshot of the battles in his own bureaucracy left him with little choice, but also that he's warming to the task. Far from cutting a swathe through TfL as the search-and-destroy set urged, he appears rather glad of its expertise.</p> <p>Scope for further discord remains: in a persuasive <a href=\"http://www.mayorwatch.co.uk/tim-parker-ray-lewis-janet-worth/20084751\">piece for Mayorwatch</a>, former UKIP assembly member Damian Hockney has criticised the loss from the top of City Hall's bureaucracy of Janet Worth, the sort of subtle public servant who knows how to manage change; reports persist that not every member of Johnson's team is operating effectively or happy with their lot. But now, at last, there is some hope that the shape and true character of Johnson's mayoralty will start emerging from the smoke. </p> <p>What form of Tory governance will be revealed? The signs so far have been intriguingly mixed, due in part to Johnson learning \u2013 as politicians tend to \u2013 the banal truth that putting campaign pledges into effect is less straightforward than it seemed when they were made. It's one thing to talk the talk about cutting costs, devolving power and being \"cleaner, safer, greener\", another to walk the walk, especially when unannounced lamp posts keep on getting in your way. The outline principles coincide with Cameron's detoxing of the Tory national brand, but Johnson has hinted at impatience with it too. </p> <p>His Daily Telegraph columns \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/may/15/dailytelegraph.pressandpublishing\">kerching</a>! \u2013 provide the strongest evidence. As British Olympians struck gold, he <a href=\"http://www.boris-johnson.com/2008/08/19/british-medals-at-beijing-olympics-and-2012/\">seemed to dissent</a> from the \"broken society\" message of his leader. This week, his <a href=\"http://www.boris-johnson.com/2008/09/23/financial-crisis-banking-and-housing/\">ringing defence</a> of London's bankers contrasted sharply with the shrinking silence of young Dave and <a href=\"http://www.georgeosborne.co.uk/\">boy George</a>. He's also used his space in Her Majesty's broadsheet to <a href=\"http://www.boris-johnson.com/2008/09/16/471/\">stick up for</a> the BBC licence fee. Though not in this case at sharp odds with his party's top brass, the article again suggested a developing political autonomy and screams of agony from the right, which have become a familiar sound recently. </p> <p>Is Mayor Boris the son of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher\">Thatch</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Macmillan\">Supermac</a>, or some novel genetic hybrid of the two? Will his mayoralty make the mould for a Cameron government or come to be seen as a platform for a Bullingdon Club old boys rivalry? In the end, it may not matter much at all: City Hall is not 10 Downing Street and London is not Britain. From the conference stage in Britain's second city the leader of its first will surely tickle and thrill the true-blue faithful, as he has always done. But many will be alive to any small deviation from the new party line \u2013 Cameron among them.</p>",

  "<p>Gordon Brown's Labour <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/sep/26/speeches.labourconference\">party conference speech</a> was well received, certainly within the conference bubble. Some have seen it as the start of a change in direction. I hope they are right. One part of the speech, that attracted little attention, dealt with the government's proposals for further welfare reform. In this area the Tories are still cheering. They are only too happy for this government to begin the final demolition of the Beveridge welfare state. </p> <p>James Purnell's green paper, <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/welfarereform/noonewrittenoff/noonewrittenoff-complete.pdf\">No one written off: reforming welfare to reward responsibility (pdf)</a>, proposes to abolish income support. The \"safety net\" benefit that first appeared as <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1948/cukpga_19480029_en_1\">national assistance</a> in 1948, is a cornerstone of the Beveridge reforms that insisted on support at basic subsistence level to those with no other means of support. James Purnell is the first secretary of state to argue for its abolition going where even <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Fowler\">Norman Fowler</a> didn't dare when he was cutting social security in the mid 1980s. </p> <p>The switching of hundreds of thousands of lone parents from income support to jobseeker's allowance will require them to be available for and actively seeking work. This is a conditional benefit, and if you do not satisfy the conditions your benefit is not paid. The uncomfortable truth is that by withdrawing benefit from parents and carers you also withdraw support from their children, a nightmare scenario for <a href=\"http://www.pcs.org.uk/\">Public and Commercial Services Union</a> members.</p> <p>The government is already preparing to withdraw income support from lone parents whose youngest child reaches age seven. It is claimed there is sufficient childcare provision to enable these parents to work. But, in outlining the government's next steps on childcare, Gordon Brown has acknowledged that key pieces of the jigsaw may not be in place for some time. </p> <p>The green paper goes further and asks what we should expect from parents with children under seven. It makes clear the government expectation that benefit should be conditional in some way and that parents should be available for full-time work-related training when their youngest child reaches age five.</p> <p>The emphasis on the stick rather than the carrot by James Purnell endangers the success of the government's <a href=\"http://www.surestart.gov.uk/surestartservices/support/helpwithchildcarecosts/newdealforloneparents/\">new deal for lone parents</a>, the most successful <a href=\"http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/outofworkhelplookingforwork/Getting_job_ready/Programmes_to_get_you_ready/New_Deal/\">new deal programme</a>, which has moved half a million lone parents into jobs through the support of expert employment advisers in Jobcentre Plus offices. It undermines Labour's own case that the Tories in the 1980's left a generation of disadvantaged women to rot in poverty, by making the absurd claim that they were a soft touch on benefits. </p> <p>What we are seeing is an adoption of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workfare\">\"workfare\"</a>, a policy that Labour explicitly rejected in 1997. The government may say that this only applies to those who have been on jobseekers allowance for two years, but their proposals will mean the biggest group on such a scheme would be lone parents, resulting in a carbon copy of the appalling US menial labour schemes, that have failed women and their children in poverty. It was absolutely right that the TUC voted unanimously to oppose the proposals. </p> <p>The green paper indicates that 2% stay on jobseeker's allowance for over two years. This would involve tens of thousands working for their benefit and not for wages. This should be seen in relation to forecasts of higher unemployment. Sticking to a full employment policy has, in past economic crises, required intervention through intermediate or transitional labour markets - make work schemes in plain language. If wages are not to be forced down, we must insist on the <a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/nmw/\">national minimum wage</a> and full trade union rights.</p> <p>My union, PCS, recently joined the growing list of sponsors of the <a href=\"http://www.endchildpoverty.org.uk/promise\">End Child Poverty \u2013 Keep the Promise</a> campaign. I'm glad that cabinet ministers will be marching with us next week, but progress towards the government's target on child poverty has stalled. Recession threatens to take us backwards. Trade unions, of course, have a particular responsibility to the one third of poor children whose parents are in low paid employment. That is why we are balloting for industrial action to protect low paid public servants, while hoping the government opts to negotiate. One thing is clear, the adoption of Tory slogans, such as \"work shy Britain\", still less Tory policies, offer no way forward in the fight against poverty.</p>",
  "<p>\"Hello Conference,</p> <p>It is clear that I am speaking to you at a time of great financial crisis, one that threatens us and our economic wellbeing. If we are not to enter a depression similar in scale to that which followed the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929\">1929 Wall Street crash</a>, radical measures, prompt action and new alignments are called for. As the party of prosperity and aspiration, we need to ask why our futures can be compromised by a global economy governed by speculation rather than sound investment. </p> <p>Consequently, when we are in government we will initiate new measures on the global, national and local levels to ensure that the present danger is averted and that this type of crisis is never repeated again. </p> <p>On a global basis, a new international agreement on capital reserves, leverage and liquidity is required. Moreover, since the current global system is merely an aggregation of individual companies and investment groups each individual player cannot account for systemic risk. </p> <p>The trouble is, we now live in a globalised world without financial fire walls, a problem in one area rapidly becomes a securitised contagion that threatens us all. Evidently, we need global capital to spread the benefits of markets and prosperity to all, but equally clearly we do not want to spread risks to all. </p> <p>How do we square this circle? </p> <p>Well, in line with the new Conservative philosophy of localism, we will pursue the increasing decentralisation and diversification of global capital. We need to extend the benefits of markets without increasing the risk of global exposure. We need local, regional and national capital that is not directly tied into a purely global system \u2013 new regulatory regimes and risks should be apportioned to the different levels at which capital is required and deployed. </p> <p>Indeed, since some leveraged instruments in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/21/creditcrunch.marketturmoil\">credit default swaps</a> have reached the value of over 50tn dollars \u2013 the local wealth of a nation or a city should not be reliant on such enormous counterparty risks. After all, a local investment trust (about which more later) dedicated to the business of restoring the glory and prosperity of our northern cities should not be investing in the value of American housing stock, but rather improving its own.</p> <p>This new localism of capital stems from our account of how markets, left to themselves, tend to monopoly, and markets based on speculation rather than investment tend to leverage. A Conservative government believes in markets free from both private- and public-sector cartels. Consequently, we do not believe that market failure should be passed to the state in bad times, and market success then from the state to the market in good times \u2013 this just circulates a monopoly interest without the involvement of the community and the ordinary citizen. </p> <p>We need to transfer that wealth, investment and asset to civil society to undergird the revival of the social order and truly extend property and prosperity to all. We need to do this because, looking at the current situation, the ordinary British citizen is in real trouble: she or he is now saving less than at any time since the late 1940s, and <a href=\"http://www.creditaction.org.uk/debt-statistics.html\">is more heavily indebted</a> than ever before in history. The dream of mass share ownership has collapsed and the bottom half of the population excluding housing <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=2\">now owns less than 1%</a> of the country's wealth. In addition, as we all know in the face of the compounded year on year effect of rising inflation in the cost of food, energy and shelter, ordinary wages are not enough, not for those who live alone, not for those who share and not even when all members of the household work.</p> <p>We need a New Conservative Deal \u2013 a new settlement with the British public where we extend and augment the ownership society so that all may benefit from growth and prosperity. To that end, and to protect what the British public have and increase their share of the wealth, I would like to announce that the following three policies will be adopted when we are elected to office:</p> <p>\u2022 We will introduce a moratorium on home repossessions. In future, all claims for home repossession will have to go through a new, fair and binding procedure that \u2013 provided that some equitable payment is made \u2013 people will be allowed to remain in their homes. This will provide a floor to the market and ensure that no firesale of property takes place \u2013 unlike America, where each new auction drives prices ever lower.</p> <p>\u2022 Through local investment trusts we will restore the logic and hope of the ownership society. These trusts through a mixture of public and private investment will back local businesses and ideas with the aim of creating in each city or town a local asset and investment economy. So that even in those areas that are the most deprived we will \u2013 through such trusts \u2013 gradually develop an economy that is not wholly reliant on low wages. We have to secure everybody or we cannot recover society. The global economy has gone south because the poor in America, who quite legitimately wanted a share of the wealth, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis\">were subjected to</a> hidden penal rates of interest \u2013 they were told their interest rates were fixed, but didn't know that that meant they could and would rise precipitately. By way of contrast, we will extend ownership to the poor through Conservative co-operatives and mutual societies that are dedicated to restoring property to people through stable and sustainable loans \u2013 whether it be by housing or shares, investments in local businesses or, indeed, a massive extension of employee-share options in those companies backed by our investment trusts. We will create an asset and investment economy for all, rather than one monopoly system where the majority is wholly reliant on wages and welfare and only a minority are able to feel economically secure.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, we Conservatives are often accused of not helping the poor. Well, let me finally lay that one to rest. We will replace the minimum wage with a living one \u2013 as Boris Johnson <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/economic_unit/workstreams/living-wage.jsp\">has already done in London</a>. There will no more minimum wage in Britain, but a living wage for all. We will partially fund this by removing tax credits for the poor, as they are nothing more than a state subsidy for low-wage employers. Why should the state subsidise the wages supermarkets pay to their staff? We will collect the money saved from the unjustifiable state subsidy of low wages and target it at the most needy, and through local investment trusts, we will reinvest it for them in a form of asset rather than income welfare, so that, in the end, they will only have assets and will not need welfare at all. As Conservatives, we oppose the management \"bonus for failure\" culture, and support instead a living wage for the working poor and a gradual amelioration of the servile condition of the working class in New Labour's Britain. Under the Conservatives, welfare serfs will gradually become owners and full citizens.</p> <p>Thus, we can see that, in the face of this crisis, the Conservatives \u2013 unlike New Labour \u2013 will speak to the real needs of British society. We will secure them in this time of crisis and deliver them to a better future: them and their families and our own wider society. A new and restored public, freed from the managerial and bureaucratic fantasy of the state and an increasing indenture to an unregulated and monopolised global market, will take responsibility for their own lives and each other.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government is committed to massive new nuclear build in Britain. We do not yet know the details of Gordon Brown's nuclear plan, least of all how all the new nuclear power stations are to be paid for. But substantial public subsidy is definitely part of the deal, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/nuclear.nuclearpower\">described by David Lowry</a> on Commentisfree and David Burke, <a href=\"http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10336\">writing in Prospect</a>. After all, EDF would hardly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/25/edf.britishenergygroup\">have paid \u00a312.5bn</a> for British Energy if it did not have a clear promise of jam tomorrow.<br> But while the Brown nuclear plan (I am referring here to Gordon Brown, of course, not his brother Andrew, EDF Energy's head of media relations) glides serenely ahead, where does this leave the UK's renewable ambitions? Remember that the UK already has a policy to generate 20% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020, and that this target will need to be doubled to around 40% for the UK to achieve its share of the new EU-wide target to source 20% of all energy from renewables by the same date. So far, Brown <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/26/biofuels.climatechange\">has been far more active</a> in trying to water down the UK's EU renewable target than in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/14/energy.renewableenergy\">finding ways to meet it</a>, in spite of the enormous renewable resources of wind, wave and tide, which sweep our shores. But even if he succeeds in the latest ploy to knock 11% off the UK's target by not counting the energy used in aviation, the UK still has a lot of renewable generation capacity to build \u2013 approaching 50,000MW of wind for a start.<br> And this creates a problem: nuclear power and intermittent renewables make a very poor match. Ministers and most nuclear advocates now insist that they have nothing against renewables \u2013 on the contrary, they adore them, and all they are advocating is a sensible mix of nuclear power and renewables to give the UK a wonderful new low-carbon electricity system. But the idea does not add up. The wind turbines (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/14/comment.greenpolitics\">onshore and increasingly offshore</a>) that will have to produce most of our renewable electricity can only generate when and where the wind is blowing. The problems of over- and under-supply created by this intermittency <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/may/12/energy.comment\">can be minimised</a> by spreading wind turbines over a broad geographical area, and by mixing them with other intermittent renewables, such as wave and solar PV. But as the renewable fraction increases, so the need to smooth out the intermittency in the electricity supply rises, and to do this with coal-fired power stations is to defeat our purpose.<br> Nuclear power has a similar but opposite problem. Once a nuclear power station is up and running, the best way to run it is to keep on producing electricity at a constant rate \u2013 until it develops some fault and cuts out altogether, that is. Add the two together, nuclear and intermittent renewables, and what do you get? You might imagine the two complement each other. But the opposite is the case. Because nuclear is \"always on\", it does nothing to smooth the supply curve from wind, or to better match total supply to demand, which is also highly variable. Indeed, the renewable supply profile fits consumer demand better than the nuclear straight-line output because the wind blows more during periods of peak electricity demand \u2013 that is mornings and evenings, and winter. By adding nuclear power into the mix, electricity supply actually fits demand worse, not better. So, the more the government backs nuclear power, the more it is undermining the future of renewables in the UK's energy supply. By backing the nuclear horse so strongly, it is revealing its probable real long-term aim: to use the ineffective and costly Renewables Obligation to fail to meet its targets (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/06/renewableenergy.greenbusiness\">which it is guaranteed to do</a>) and then claim that its nuclear power should count as \"renewable\" because it is low-carbon. Anyway, 2020 is several elections away, and whoever is in charge at the time can deal with the problem then.<br> But maybe I'm wrong and the government really does want renewables to have a major role. If so, here are five important things it ought to be doing to demonstrate its good intentions: 1. The natural companion to intermittent renewables is not nuclear but hydropower, which can be turned on and off to supply electricity when it is needed, and to store energy for when it is in surplus. So, we should seriously expand hydropower capacity in the UK, which currently stands at about 1,500MW, with a view to using it not for baseload generation but to balance gaps between supply and demand. The <a href=\"http://www.fhc.co.uk/dinorwig.htm\">pumped storage facility at Dinorwig</a> in Wales is already doing this on a huge scale, if for brief periods, with its ability to kick a colossal 1,320MW into the grid at 12 seconds' notice. We need a large number of plants designed to perform a similar role, but over periods of hours and days, rather than minutes. Small-scale hydro could also have a big role in balancing the output from individual wind farms, perhaps sharing the same grid connections. The new 100MW station at Glendoe (Scotland's first new large hydro plant in 50 years) is to be welcomed, but there is an even bigger role for small-scale hydro, which <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7593438.stm\">could produce</a> a further 650MW.<br> 2. We should also improve our connections to other European countries, as this will help to smooth the overall renewables supply curve, and so benefit all countries. Denmark, Germany, Spain and Portugal are far enough away from the UK for their wind farms to be out of sync with ours, so by linking them all together, wind power surges in one country can compensate for dips in others. There is also growing output from photovoltaic panels (PV) in Germany, Spain and Italy, which can further smooth the renewable supply curve. Also note that Denmark uses its connection to Norway, which gets 99% of its electricity from hydro, to dump surplus wind energy, and draw on the hydro when the wind drops. We should do the same. Concentrated solar power (CSP) from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/06/renewableenergy.lternativeenergy&quot;\">Spain, Portugal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/22/solarpower.windpower\">North Africa</a> will also make a huge contribution to renewable generation and supply stability. Like hydro (and unlike solar PV), CSP can store up energy (as heat) and use it to generate electricity when needed.<br> 3. We also need to beef up our own UK grid to link the places our renewable power will be coming from far away from existing power stations \u2013 and using undergound power lines so as not to disfigure our upland landscapes. A new west coast interconnector would be an excellent way to link the many power sources along the UK's western seaboard, and link to Ireland at the same time. The electricity distribution system also needs to be re-engineered to accommodate small- and medium-scale embedded generation, from local combined heat and power plants to solar PV tiles on domestic roofs. We also need to use price signals on the grid to make our demand responsive to supply, so that, for example, freezers stock up on cold when electricity is cheap, and coast along when the price is high. 4. Scrap the failed Renewables Obligation and replace it with a feed-in tarriffs system, or another system of fixed-price contracts to give renewable developers much needed security for long-term investment. This system would aim to deliver electricity quality \u2013 that is a smooth output matching demand \u2013 not just quantity. To do this, it would pay a premium for diversity of supply to bring in less productive locations, and less economic technologies such as wave power and solar PV. Note that the British Pelamis wave power technology <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/25/greentech.alternativeenergy\">has now been deployed</a> in Portugal thanks to the far greater commitment to renewables of the Portuguese government.<br> 5. Finally, the government should come clean about the deals it has made with EDF and other nuclear generators. It must be seen to hold firm to its promise not to subsidise nuclear power, either overtly or covertly, made in the 2006 Energy Review: \"It will be for the private sector to initiate, fund, construct and operate new nuclear plants and to cover the full cost of decommissioning and their full share of long-term waste management costs.\"<br></p>",

And what a wild ride it's been to get here, thanks to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/us/politics/27debatecnd.html?hp\">unpredictable behaviour </a>of a certain war hero. Actually, the wild ride continues \u2014 here's the <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/mccain-pool-report-5/\">pooled press report </a>from a few hours ago: \"McCain now boarding plane at DCA [Washington's National Airport]... Heading to Memphis, 1:50 minute flight, then motorcade to site. General atmosphere is utter confusion.\" At the Guardian's Election Headquarters, though (think flashing lights, humming banks of computers, analysts monitoring 24/7 info-feeds) we'll be cutting through the confusion with a liveblog, beginning here shortly before the debate itself at <strong>9pm eastern</strong> (2am UK time; watch the debate in the UK on BBC News Channel, Freeview 080).</p> <p>Don't forget to prepare your Debate Drinking Game: you have <a href=\"http://radaronline.com/features/2008/09/presidential_debates_barack_obama_john_mccain_01.php\">various</a> different <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-nelson/the-presidential-debate-d_b_129609.html\">options</a>. Rather than downing a shot every time McCain says \"my friends\" in a sinister fashion, or when Obama says \"as I've said before\" just prior to a major policy U-turn, my unit of consumption, I'm afraid, will be <a href=\"http://www.sierranevada.com/\">sips of Sierra Nevada, </a>because I feel some vague responsibility to stay marginally sober for a while. I'll abandon this policy upon the 30th mention of the word \"change\", and switch to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylated_spirit\">meths</a>. Join me! The Guardian is not responsible for your alcohol poisoning.</p> <p><strong>8.30pm </strong>(all times eastern): There was always going to be a huge amount at stake tonight; we're expecting the biggest TV audience ever for a presidential debate. But McCain has <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/09/_john_mccain_has_more.php\">upped the stakes</a> massively. By agreeing to debate before finalising a bailout deal, it looked like he'd blinked; he needs a \"win\" tonight if he's to erase the air of hair-trigger rashness hanging over his campaign. So he's left with something to prove, even though the subject-matter \u2014 national security and foreign policy \u2014 is supposed to be his strongest suit. (He also needs to keep his notorious tetchiness in check: it'll be fascinating to see if Obama, a far cooler customer, tries in subtle ways to wind him up.) </p> <p>Obama's challenges are more longstanding. The conventional wisdom is that he needs to persuade America he'd make a credible commander-in-chief: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/us/politics/26poll.html\">most voters still prefer McCain</a> for that role. Like McCain, he has a reputation as a not-particularly-good debater; Obama's fault is a tendency to longwindedness and condescension. More voters <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2008/09/26/oh-the-expectations-theyll-set-11/\">expect Obama to outperform McCain</a> \u2014 but that, of course, only sets the expectations so as to reward McCain if he does minimally well.</p> <p><strong>The venue</strong> for the debate is the stately Mississippi town of Oxford \u2014 specifically the campus of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mississippi\">University of Mississippi</a>, once the scene of anti-desegregation riots. <strong>The audience</strong> includes many students and faculty, who apparently <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/No_love_at_Ole_Miss.html\">aren't pleased</a> with McCain's recent antics. <strong>The moderator</strong> tonight is kindly, almond-eyed 74-year-old newscaster <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/aboutus/bio_lehrer.html\">Jim Lehrer</a>, who has moderated 10 of these debates already \u2014 more than anyone else. (He'll almost certainly ask a question or two about the economy.) As for <strong>the format</strong>: the 90-minute event will be divided into nine segments of nine minutes each, but exactly what happens in each one is unclear: the Obama campaign lawyer who helped negotiate the arrangement has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Barnett_Unprecedented_freeform_debate_format.html\">described it</a> as \"unprecedented\". In the first four minutes, Lehrer will ask a question of each of the candidates, and they'll reply, but the remaining five minutes are at Lehrer's discretion. That part could even involve the candidates debating each other directly. </p> <p>OK, I'm opening the Sierra Nevada now. Stand by...</p> <p><strong>8.56pm</strong> Lehrer is explaining his plans for the night to the audience. \"No cellphones!... You all can talk among yourselves until I say hush, and that'll give you a few seconds to chill out.\" Jeez, OK. </p> <p><strong>9.00pm</strong> Here we go! As you can see from the picture, Lehrer faces the podiums (podia?), which are at right-angles to each other. (Jim Lehrer always looks a bit naturally startled to me, but I don't think he is, really. It's just his eyes.) \"Tonight will primarily be about national security and foreign policy, which... includes global finance.\" Ah, clever. Obama and McCain enter and shake hands. Obama has his hand out first, and gets to grab McCain's forearm. Crucial dominant body language, according to some psychology book I once read.</p> <p><strong>9.02pm</strong> \"At this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan?\" Obama lays out his plan and goes straight for the punch, condemning \"failed policies... supported by Senator McCain.\" That didn't take long. </p> <p>McCain: \"I do have a sad note tonight, Senator Kennedy is in the hospital tonight...\" Feel the bipartisanship! (This is true. And sad. But McCain <em>always does this</em>.) He seems out-of-breath, but that's because he RACED IN from Washington. He sings the praises of the deal he didn't actually broker and that hasn't actually been brokered yet. \"Debate each other!\" Lehrer suggests now.</p> <p><strong>9.12pm</strong> They really don't want to debate each other. Lehrer just made Obama repeat a line about McCain \u2014 and his \"fundamentals\" line from a few days back \u2014 to McCain directly. \"Are you worried I couldn't hear it?\" McCain says. Lehrer is a rather strange man, I think.</p> <p><strong>9.14pm</strong> Lehrer: \"Are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obama's approach to what you would do as president to lead the country out of this?\" Now McCain, railing against pork-barrel spending, is waving a felt-tip pen around -- \"this one's kind of an old one\" -- which he says he'd use to \"veto every spending bill\" that passed across his desk. Obama responds by pointing out that earmarking doesn't count for much government spending, compared to tax breaks for the wealthy. Also \u2014 what a rubbish pen. </p> <p>\"I was called 'the Sheriff',\" McCain says, chuckling, as part of an incredibly rambling answer about earmarking. I don't think anyone else laughed. Obama interrupts a McCain riff about how raising taxes is bad. \"I don't know where John's getting his figures... When you look at your tax policies, you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, and that is a continuation of the last eight years.\" He's not holding back on that theme.</p> <p>DRINK! \"2,000, <em>my friends,</em> 2,000!\" \u2014 it's something to do with earmarks, of course, it always is.</p> <p>More on taxes. \"A lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of 'rich',\" says McCain. According to scientists, that was the most foolish thing McCain could possibly say, since the only \"definition of rich\" anyone can remember was McCain's $5m-a-year definition. </p> <p><strong>9.25pm</strong>: A testy exchange on taxes. They're interrupting each other every few seconds now, accusing each other of not telling the truth. When McCain tries but fails to interrupt, he smiles thinly and chuckles. This is not advisable. Now we're onto another bailout question. What will you have to give up, as president, to pay for the bailout plan? Obama talks... and talks... McCain: \"Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the Senate. It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.\" McCain smiles at his own joke; Obama gives a hilariously small and patronising chuckle, as if to spare McCain's blushes.</p> <p><strong>9.32pm</strong>: Obama just called McCain 'Tom', by \"accident\". Later he will call him 'Whatever-your-name-is,' or maybe 'Bernard'. Lehrer's getting testy at the two candidates' refusal to admit that they'll have no money left to do anything when they get into office, because Wall Street has collapsed and soon the money system will be suspended anyway and we will all have to start living in treehouses, scavenging for scraps.</p> <p><strong>Scorecard so far:</strong> Barack Obama is winning if you measure by substantiveness of answers. John McCain is winning if you count number of years spent in a Vietnamese jail.</p> <p><strong>9.40pm</strong>: Election's over; John McCain just made the same joke twice in the same debate. \"I wasn't nominated Miss Congeniality in the Senate,\" he says. This wasn't funny the first time. Oh, and: DRINK! Twice. \"I'm a maverick of the Senate, and I'm proud to say I've got a maverick with me\" as running-mate. Yet McCain is a maverick, I note, who's not wearing a flag-pin tonight \u2014 unlike secret Muslim Barack Obama. Interesting...</p> <p>And now we're onto foreign policy at last: Iraq. \"John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007; the war started in 2003...\" \u2014 a long and punchy litany of McCain's smoke-and-mirrors rhetoric on the war, probably Obama's best performance so far tonight. Strange, seeing as how he's supposed to be better on the economy. </p> <p>McCain is lecturing Obama now on the difference between strategy and tactics, and how Obama \"did the incredible thing of voting to cut off funding for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\" Obama's responds well \u2014 not too law-professory: both senators have voted against troop funding in certain contexts, he points out, because of disputes over whether or not to endorse a timetable for troop withdrawal.</p> <p><strong>9.49pm</strong>: They're completely talking over each other now. It's like BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p> <p><strong>9.54pm</strong>: Pakistan. McCain is chastising Obama for threatening air strikes in public. That area hasn't been governed since the days of Alexander the Great, he points out, days McCain presumably remembers only too well. Obama says he hasn't threatened air strikes on Pakistan, and reminds the audience that McCain's recommendation of foreign-policy sobriety doesn't sit well with the fact that he \"sings songs about bombing Iran.\" Ouch.</p> <p>Now. Let's address the matter of the 'audience reaction monitor', rolling along the bottom of the screen on CNN's feed. It's like a heart monitor, and it's designed to show the responses of groups of Republican, Democratic and Independent voters, to whom CNN, presumably, jhas given electronic dials. The problem is that it's always basically flat. When McCain talks, Republicans like it slightly more; when Obama talks, Democrats like it more. But basically it's flat. This tells us nothing about anything at all.</p> <p>...Oh, but the Republicans with their dials do love McCain talking about all the mothers of troops he's met. The candidates are battling over the bracelets they wear from the mothers of deceased servicemen. Hmm. \"I have a bracelet too!\" says Obama. I don't.</p> <p><strong>10.05pm</strong>: Iran. \"Let's have some straight talk,\" says McCain -- DRINK!, surely -- outlining his plan for a \"league of democracies\" that would impose sanctions on Iran. But overall the exchanges seem pretty evenly matched. Now McCain is talking about Obama's willingness to talk to America's enemies without precondition. He makes a big deal about stumbling on the pronunciation of 'Ahmedinejad' -- deliberately, I thought...? Obama responds that one of McCain's advisors, Henry Kissinger, recently endorsed the idea of speaking to Iran, but the rest of his explanation of the definition of \"preconditions\" for diplomatic contacts is pretty convoluted. Or maybe I've just had too much Sierra Nevada?</p> <p><strong>10.13pm</strong>: Obama gets in a nice zinger about McCain's weird Spain gaffe last week, but then McCain rouses himself and delivers probably his punchiest passage so far, repeatedly suggesting that Obama's approach is \"dangerous\". McCain waxes deeply sarcastic about the notion of Obama meeting Ahmedinejad and telling him off for wanting to \"wipe Israel off the map\", and Obama doesn't get his comeback in fast enough before Lehrer moves the discussion on. Advantage McCain, in purely political terms, I think...</p> <p><strong>10.20pm</strong>: And so to Russia. As Wikipedia notes in comments, we're going to have to start drinking every time McCain accuses Obama of not understanding something. Obama doesn't understand the Russia/Georgia situation, he says \u2014 but surprisingly, after being mocked on the very point by Obama, he decided to repeat his very, very odd remark about looking into Vladimir Putin's eyes and seeing the letters KGB. Putin wears shades most of the time anyway, doesn't he? Probably to cover up the embarrassing fact that he's got letters written on his eyes.</p> <p><strong>10.25pm</strong>: A clash on energy independence and alternative energy. Much interruption. McCain has started grinning broadly; Obama's doing it too now, as they both object to each other's claim that the other objected to alternative fuels. If you see what I mean.</p> <p><strong>10.27pm</strong>: Likelihood of another 9/11 attack? McCain: \"Much less likely than the day after 9/11, but we're a long way from safe.\" Obama: \"I think we are safer in some ways\" \u2014 securing airports, etcetera \u2014 \"but we have a long way to go.\" More \"Obama doesn't understand\" from McCain. His contempt for Obama is tangible \u2014 he can't look him in the eye, and sneers while he's speaking \u2014 but it makes for an undeniably strong performance. They're competing for the last word now.</p> <p>\"There are some advantages to experience and knowledge, and I don't think Obama has the experience... we've seen this stubbornness before, in this administration\" \u2014 McCain is accusing Obama of being too close to Bush. We live in interesting times. </p> <p>Obama tells a story about his Kenyan father's faith in the American dream, and how America isn't viewed in the same way around the world now as it was then. Some people will say that this means he hates America. McCain: \"When I came home from prison...\" Drink. He seems close to tears as he talks about helping veterans and \"healing the wounds of war.\"</p> <p>...Aaaand that's it. McCain gets the last word, but not in a particularly thunderous or resounding way. The two men shake hands, greet their wives, then shake hands with each others' wives, and then kindly, almond-eyed Jim Lehrer shakes various hands too.</p> <p>Well. This was clearly a much better night for McCain than many were expecting; after an unremarkable start, he appeared to find his ground on foreign policy, and delivered significantly more damaging blows to Obama than vice-versa; Obama missed too many opportunities, and was maybe too generous in many of his replies. Then again, various TV pundits are right now hotly debating the notion that McCain's dripping contempt for Obama -- and his strange, nervous grinning and chuckling, like some kind of chuckling maverick -- looked unpresidential, while the Democrat looked the part pretty much all the way through. Both of these arguments are clearly true. Which one triumphs?</p> <p>A win for McCain, I'd say, especially given the expectations. But not a decisive one, or a knockout, by any means. But what do I know? I've drunk a whole third of one bottle of Sierra Nevada.</p> <p><strong>11.36pm</strong>: ...Actually, just before I go: in <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/09/26/politics/horserace/entry4482028.shtml\">a CBS instant poll of uncommitted voters</a>, 40% awarded the debate to Obama, 22% to McCain, the rest thought it was a draw. So don't let anyone tell you it was a win for McCain yet -- like, say, I just did.</p> <p>Thanks for reading and commenting; keep going...</p> <p>UPDATE, SATURDAY MORNING: <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/27/debate.poll/?iref=hpmostpop\">More evidence</a> from a CNN instant poll to contradict my initial post-debate hunch that the relentlessness of McCain's attacks last night would leave him with the upper hand. It finds Obama in front. A CNN pollster explains: \"It can be reasonably concluded, especially after accounting for the slight Democratic bias in the survey, that we witnessed a tie in Mississippi tonight. But given the direction of the campaign over the last couple of weeks, a tie translates to a win for Obama.\"</p>"
