  "<p>The world's largest insurance company, AIG, spent $440,000 on a lavish corporate retreat at one of California's top beachside resorts a few days after accepting an $85bn emergency loan from the US government to stave off bankruptcy.</p> <p>Details of the week-long getaway enraged legislators at a congressional hearing yesterday where AIG's former bosses were accused of spending taxpayers' money on pedicures, golf games and cocktails.</p> <p>Crippled by losses on financial insurance companies, AIG was bailed out by US taxpayers on September 17 to avert a collapse which risked causing further failures.</p> <p>The House oversight committee, which is investigating the company's problems, confronted AIG executives with an invoice from the St Regis resort in Monarch Beach, south of Los Angeles, detailing an eight-day company event which began five days after the rescue.</p> <p>\"Average Americans are suffering economically,\" said Henry Waxman, chairman of the committee. \"They are losing their jobs, their homes and their health insurance. Yet less than one week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation.\"</p> <p>The bill shows that AIG spent $139,375 on rooms, $147,301 on \"banquets\", $23,380 on spa treatments and $6,939 on golf at an eight-day company event which began on September 22.</p> <p>\"US taxpayers will be, in effect, paying for this,\" said Elijah Cummings, another Democrat, who demanded to know who was responsible for the outlay. \"I think that person ought to be fired.\"</p> <p>Rates for the 325 rooms at the resort are typically upwards of $500 a night and the travel guide Fodor's gives the place a rave review, saying: \"Exclusivity and indulgence carry the day here; you can even have someone unpack for you.\"</p> <p>AIG has defended the event, saying it was to entertain freelance insurance salesmen who sold life, health and accident policies for the group's US subsidiary.</p> <p>But former chief executive Robert Willumstad, who stood down as a condition of the government's bail-out, conceded that the getaway \"seems very inappropriate\".</p> <p>\"If I had been aware of it, I would have prevented it from happening,\" he added.</p> <p>Defending their conduct in AIG's final days, Willumstad and his British-born predecessor, Martin Sullivan, blamed the company's problems on accounting rules which required it to write off billions of dollars on mortgage-related securities.</p> <p>Sullivan said these rules had \"unintended consequences\" in making AIG's books look worse than they actually were against the backdrop of a \"financial tsunami\".</p> <p>Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York, accused the two executives of blaming accountants for AIG's difficulties when in fact they had been \"wrecking a great company\" by gambling on obscure derivatives. \"I think you should apologise to the American people for your mismanagement,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Looking back at my time as CEO, I don't believe AIG could have done anything differently,\" said Willumstad. \"The market seizure was an unprecedented global catastrophe.\"</p>",
  "<p>Alarm over the health of leading US banks sent Wall Street shares plummeting for a fifth successive day despite a broad hint from the Federal Reserve of an imminent cut in interest rates.</p> <p>The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 508 points to 9,447. There were signs of a fresh collapse in confidence in financial institutions as Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America each lost a fifth of their value.</p> <p>In a week, the blue-chip US index has fallen by 1,400 points, wiping 13% off share prices. The sell-off accelerated after the Fed's chairman, Ben Bernanke, warned of dark days ahead: \"Economic activity is likely to be subdued during the remainder of this year and into next year.\" He spoke of \"financial turmoil\" in a speech to a conference in Washington.</p> <p>Bernanke said the slowdown had eased the risk of inflation and in a sentence widely interpreted as a suggestion of an interest rate cut, he added: \"The Federal Reserve will need to consider whether the current stance of policy remains appropriate.\"</p> <p>In a mood of extreme edginess on Wall Street trading floors, speculation circulated that US banks were struggling to raise money. A rumour did the rounds that a planned $9bn investment in Morgan Stanley by Japan's Mitsubishi was falling apart, sending the US firm's shares down 20% despite its insistence that the deal was on track.</p> <p>Bank of America took a hammering on suggestions that it was struggling to find subscribers for a $10bn fundraising. Its shares dived 26% although there were indications after the market closed that the cash call had been oversubscribed. </p> <p>Merrill Lynch fell 25% because it is being taken over by Bank of America in a share-for-share transaction which is rapidly declining in value.</p> <p>President George Bush, who was visiting an office supply company in a Washington suburb, acknowledged that times were \"tough\" but insisted the US would recover, saying: \"We've been through tough times before. I wish I could snap my fingers and make what happened stop. But that's not the way it works.\"</p> <p>The sell-off came in spite of an effort by the US central bank to thaw out the credit markets by using public money to purchase commercial paper - a type of short-term debt issued by companies to generate day-to-day funding.</p> <p>Faced with the worsening environment, analysts at Deutsche Bank forecast that the US economy will shrink by 2% in the final quarter and unemployment could hit 7% next year. \"Financial conditions are deteriorating at an ever faster pace,\" said Deutsche's economists in a note to clients. \"The economy needs credit expansion and without it, activity could collapse.\"</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund raised its estimate of losses from the global financial crisis to the US banking system to about $1.4tn (\u00a3800bn), up 45% from the $945bn it estimated in April and reaffirmed just two months ago. </p> <p>The figures, released in its twice-yearly Global Financial Stability Review, gave fresh impetus to the push for a comprehensive and coordinated international response to the crisis, which the IMF said had become disorderly and more damaging than previously thought.</p> <p>It also estimated that the global banks needed to raise $675bn in new capital in the next few years. The IMF's managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said the report \"shows how serious a crisis we currently face\". </p> <p>\"The time for piecemeal solutions is over. I therefore call on policymakers to urgently address the crisis at a national level with comprehensive measures to restore confidence in the financial sector. At the same time, national governments must closely coordinate these efforts to bring about a return to stability in the international financial system.\"</p> <p>The global financial crisis has its roots in the US mortgage industry, where the sheer scale of liabilities on subprime loans is gradually becoming clear. The US Mortgage Bankers Association revealed yesterday that US lenders lost an average of $560 on every mortgage written last year.</p>",
  "<p>Genetically modified crops that are drought resistant will be grown by farmers within four to five years, according to scientists developing the technology.</p> <p>Dr David Dennis, the chief executive of Performance Plants Incorporated in Kingston, Ontario, said varieties of drought-tolerant oilseed rape and maize were already being tested in field trials in the US. He claimed the new varieties can increase yield by 40% when the plants are most water-stressed.</p> <p>Climate scientists predict that global warming will make arable land in many developing countries less productive or unusable. Advocates of GM crops often defend the technology by arguing that drought and salt-tolerant varieties can play an important role in adapting to global warming.</p> <p>Last month, the then UK science minister Dr Ian Pearson told the Guardian he thought the British public would support GM if the industry demonstrated environmental benefits. </p> <p>\"I think that the public want to see benefits for GM technology for the consumer, not just for the fertiliser company or the farmer. If GM can demonstrably provide benefits for people living in sub-Saharan Africa then I think the public will want to support those as products and want to see them commercialised,\" he said.</p> <p>But GM's opponents counter that drought and salt tolerance always seems to be just out of reach. \"We would take any claims that these crops are just around the corner with a large pinch of salt because we have heard it all before,\" said Claire Oxborrow of Friends of the Earth. So far, almost all GM varieties available commercially are either tolerant of herbicides or produce their own pesticide.</p> <p>She said that companies are using the food crisis and the threat of climate change as a PR opportunity. \"We are seeing a lot more promises, especially now connected with the food crisis,\" she said.</p> <p>Dennis said his company is developing several crops with modifications to existing genes which result in a variety of different effects. The company plans to license its technology to major crop companies such as Syngenta and Pioneer.</p> <p>Drought-tolerant oilseed rape plants, which have been in field trials in the American Mid-West, Colorado and California for four years, are at the most advanced stage. A drought tolerant variety of maize has been tested in field trials for two years. The company is also working on modifications for more efficient water use, larger seeds, heat tolerance and increased biomass. The latter modification is aimed at producing fast-growing material for the nascent biofuel industry.</p> <p>Dennis predicted that it would take four to five years of field testing and clearing regulatory hurdles before the plants can be sold. \"You've got to show that it will work in situ in the field over several years,\" he said. </p> <p>One concern is that the plants may cross with wild relatives, potentially creating a drought-resistant super-weed that becomes impossible to eradicate. Dennis said that this was a remote possibility because hybrids between his crop varieties and wild species do not survive well.</p> <p>\"Is there a risk in it? There's risk in everything we do,\" he said. \"I think the risk is so small I'm not worried about it. But I am worried about what we do if we don't develop these technologies.\" </p> <p>He said the world needed a 21st century version of the \"green revolution\" to increase crop yields to feed the projected world population of 9 billion by 2050.</p> <p>Dennis said his company would also make the technology freely available to farmers in the developing world. Performance Plants signed an agreement with Africa Harvest Biotech Foundation International \u2014 an NGO based in Kenya that has previously collaborated with Monsanto \u2014 which allows them to distribute the technology without paying licence fees. </p> <p>\"If the technology is used by small farmers we will forgo any royalties. It will be available to them free of charge,\" said Dennis. The group is also beginning work on pursuing similar genetic modifications in local crops such as sorghum and cassava. </p> <p>The company identified its target genes by inducing genetic changes in up to 100,000 plants \u2014 for example by blasting them with x-rays \u2014 and screening them for desirable characteristics. Dennis's researchers then select those plants with the desired characteristics. The drought tolerant varieties have a mutation that changes the activity of an enzyme called farnesyltransferase. The modification leads to changes in the way the plant reacts to a hormone that is involved in its response to low water levels. \"The plant responds to drought a lot faster and more effectively than other plants,\" said Dennis.</p> <p>Oxborrow said she was sceptical that significant drought tolerance could be achieved with a single gene change. \"The reason we haven't seen drought tolerant crops come to commercial reality so far is because the plant physiology is much more complicated than the relatively simple technology around herbicide tolerance and insect resistance,\" she said. \"Plant scientists are still working out how plants cope with water shortage.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Brown may campaign in Glenrothes byelection</h2> <p>Gordon Brown plans to personally campaign to retain Labour's seat in Glenrothes, despite claiming earlier this year that prime ministers should avoid byelection contests. Jim Murphy, the new Scottish secretary, said the prime minister was \"determined\" to take part in the campaign next to his own constituency if he could spare time from dealing with the banking crisis. Brown's arrival in Glenrothes is likely to ignite the battle for the seat. His future as Labour leader rests in part on preventing the Scottish National party from inflicting a third byelection defeat on the government this year. <br><strong>Severin Carrell</strong></p> <h2>Hell's Angel's killers were waiting in layby, jury told</h2> <p>The killers of the Hell's Angel shot dead on the M40 last year parked in a layby while they chose their victim from passing bikers, Birmingham crown court heard yesterday. Gerry Tobin, 35, was killed as he rode back to London from the Bulldog Bash biker festival in Warwickshire on August 12. The jury was shown CCTV images of a Rover car alleged to have been used in the shooting. Timothy Raggatt QC, prosecuting, said: \"The car closed up on Mr Tobin and there were two shots.\" One hit Tobin in the neck and passed through his spine into his skull. Six men deny murder and possessing firearms. The trial continues. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Return of jellyfish that caused \u00a31m salmon losses</h2> <p>Jellyfish which cost \u00a31m in losses to salmon farms in Northern Ireland have returned to the Irish Sea. The mauve stinger jellyfish were spotted along a beach at Portrush, according to the Environment Agency. Scientists have confirmed that the small purple creatures were the same type of jellyfish that killed more than 150,000 salmon in cages off the north Antrim coast last year. The agency said there was no indication yet of a repeat of last year's \"catastrophic bloom\". Marine conservation officer Joe Breen advised people to stay clear of the jellyfish, which could give \"a nasty, powerful sting\". <br><strong>Henry McDonald</strong></p> <h2>Diabetes costs NHS \u00a31m every hour, says charity</h2> <p>The NHS spends \u00a31m every hour on treating the medical consequences of diabetes, including blindness, stroke and amputation, researchers say today. The charity Diabetes UK found that the disease costs \u00a39bn a year, about 10% of the NHS budget. Douglas Smallwood, chief executive, said the number of people known to have diabetes increased from 1.3 million in 2002 to 2.3 million this year. About 500,000 cases were undiagnosed and a rise in obesity was likely to exacerbate the problem. By 2025 there would be more than 4 million diabetics, he said at the start of a healthier lifestyle campaign. <br><strong>John Carvel</strong></p> <h2>Animal rights conspiracy extended to US, court told</h2> <p>British extremists drew up plans to target every company that deals with the New York Stock Exchange as part of a six-year blackmail conspiracy to shut down one of the world's biggest animal testing laboratories, a court heard yesterday. Winchester crown court was told that leading members of the animal rights organisation Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac) considered how to put pressure on the New York Stock Exchange to stop listing shares in Huntingdon Life Sciences, in Cambridgeshire. The five defendants all deny conspiracy to blackmail. The trial continues. <br><strong>Sandra Laville</strong></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/vodafonegroup\"> Vodafone</a> will put pressure on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/pda+apple\">Apple</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone\">iPhone</a> today with news that it has clinched an exclusive deal to offer the first touchscreen phone made by the mobile email specialist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/vodafonegroup\">BlackBerry</a> in time for Christmas.</p> <p>The BlackBerry Storm, which has a revolutionary \"clickable\" touchscreen that prevents a user accidentally sending an email or making a call just by touching the screen, will be free for anyone willing to sign up with Vodafone to a \u00a335-a-month contract. A pre-pay version is also being planned.</p> <p>The device is aimed squarely at consumers rather than the corporate market, which is already dominated by BlackBerry devices. It faces serious competition at Christmas from the Apple phone and two other recently announced touchscreen devices: the G1, which uses Google's Android software and is exclusive to T-Mobile, and the 5800 XpressMusic from Nokia, which Orange confirmed last night it would be stocking, although it is unclear if it will be out by Christmas. </p> <p>But Jens Schulte-Bockum, Vodafone's global head of terminals, has no doubt about the BlackBerry Storm's potential. \"This will be one of the bestsellers, if not the bestseller, in the contract market for Christmas,\" he said. \"We have very aggressive plans for it.\"</p> <p>\"I very much see this as a mainstream product in the consumer market,\" added Nick Read, who heads Vodafone in the UK but will shortly move to run its Asian businesses. \"You have all the robustness of BlackBerry but with multi-media and you have a touchscreen that actually works for texting and email. From my perspective, this is really meeting the needs of a more sophisticated consumer.\"</p> <p>Vodafone asked BlackBerry to come up with an exclusive device about a year ago, after it failed to secure an exclusive deal for the iPhone in any of its markets. The result is a BlackBerry that replaces the trademark tiny keypad with a touchscreen.</p> <p>Some analysts are likely to question the wisdom of launching such a high-end device in a recession but Read is undeterred. \"There are certain sectors such as financial services where there will be job losses and they all have BlackBerries so there will be a degree of loss there,\" he admitted. \"But it is so outweighed by the potential to go down into small business and into consumer.\"</p> <p>The device appears cheaper than the G1, which T-Mobile is expected to make free for anyone on a \u00a340-a-month deal, and the iPhone, which O2 gives away free with a \u00a345-a-month contract. But T-Mobile and O2 tie in customers for only 18 months, while Vodafone is demanding that they sign up for two years.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/rafael-benitez\">Rafael Ben\u00edtez</a> is still waiting to be approached by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool\">Liverpool's </a>American owners over a new contract, nine months after Tom Hicks revealed his intention to extend the Spaniard's stay at Anfield.</p> <p>Despite overseeing an impressive start to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a> campaign - the side lie second to Chelsea on goal difference - and progressing to the lucrative group phase of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a> for the fifth time in five seasons as Liverpool manager, Ben\u00edtez has received no word on a contract extension.</p> <p>The issue did not arise when the Liverpool manager met George Gillett, Hicks' co-owner, before and after the league victory over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchesterunited\">Manchester United</a> at Anfield last month and there are no plans in place to open negotiations.</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez's deal expires at the end of next season and while that offers ample time to negotiate a new contract for the 48-year-old, who wishes to extend his Anfield reign, the delay is a further illustration of the impasse which exists among the Liverpool hierarchy and the uncertainty that it brings to long-term planning at the club. Although Hicks wants to offer the manager at least a 12-month extension, he cannot do so without the agreement of Gillett or acquiring majority control of Liverpool. The Texan has neither at present.</p> <p>\"I would prefer to have a long-term contract and then you can have a long-term plan,\" said Ben\u00edtez, who was last night encouraged by news that the defender Martin Skrtel should be back by Christmas from the knee injury he sustained on Sunday at Manchester City. \"All managers need time but it is more difficult to get that now.</p> <p>\"All managers are in the same situation. The problem in England now is that everyone wants to be successful too soon. That is the part of the game I don't like. But I'm really pleased to be here and I have two more years left on my contract, so right now I'm just trying to do my job as best I can. I've always said I want to stay here for many years.\"</p> <p>It was in January that Hicks revealed plans to extend Ben\u00edtez's contract, having sparked outrage among Liverpool supporters by approaching J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann about the Spaniard's job, with Gillett, two months earlier. He followed that up in April by stating: \"If I were to buy George out the first thing I would do is offer Rafa a one-year extension to make sure he is going to be here up to when we get the stadium. Hopefully we could have some success and then extend him again.\"</p> <p>Both Liverpool's new stadium and Hicks' hopes of purchasing just 1% of Gillett's stake have since stalled indefinitely, with the global economic crisis cited for the construction delay and Gillett preferring to sell up to Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The ruler of Dubai has not conceded defeat in his exhaustive attempt to purchase Liverpool but the Americans' valuation of the club remains far in excess of what he is prepared to pay.</p> <p>With Liverpool enjoying the best start to a season under his management, however, Ben\u00edtez is determined to keep off-field distractions to a minimum: \"I'm not really worried about the situation at the moment. I am trying to be pragmatic about it and am just concentrating on the things I can improve. It doesn't make it more difficult for me to plan for the future. I can only control things on the pitch, improve the squad, and if I can do that then things will be easier in the future.\"</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez was relieved to discover Skrtel is expected to be sidelined for little more than two months. The Slovakian visited a specialist yesterday and was informed that knee surgery is unnecessary.</p>",
  "<p>The number of leading British companies willing to disclose their carbon footprint to City investors has fallen this year, research reveals today.</p> <p>Only 58% of companies in the FTSE-250 index responded to the latest survey by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Those who refused to take part include Thomas Cook and the InterContinental Hotels Group. </p> <p>The figures have angered environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth, which said they undermined efforts to make reporting mandatory.</p> <p>Those firms that did reveal their numbers to the CDP include Shell, which admitted that the total amount of carbon produced by extracting and then burning its oil and gas reached 743m tonnes last year - considerably higher than the total for the whole of the UK.</p> <p>Drax, the coal-fired power station company, was among those that did give details to the project but only on condition they were not publicly revealed. </p> <p>Some of those that refused to cooperate claimed that global warming was not \"relevant\" to their operations or said they did not have the resources to provide information, said Paul Simpson, chief operating officer of the CDP, which acts on behalf of 385 institutional investors with $57tn (\u00a333tn) of funds under management.</p> <p>\"It is very concerning but it's a matter of whether you look at the glass half empty or the glass half full,\" he said. \"There is enormous progress from where we were five years ago.\" </p> <p>The well-to-wheels figures released by Shell, BP and others were worrying, he admitted. \"The emissions from product use given by companies such as Shell, BP and Rio Tinto are high but we should really be applauding these companies for leading the way by providing full Scope 3 disclosures [including product use and disposal as well as production]. This is not a company problem; it is a society problem because we use these products and we can only deal with it if we have some true figures to deal with.\"</p> <p>Shell's 743m tonnes compares with 587m for Britain as a whole and is likely to grow as the company develops its tar sand schemes in Canada. Rio Tinto reported 660m and BP 521m tonnes. </p> <p>Tim Jenkins, chief economist at Friends of the Earth, said the poor level of response to the CDP survey showed that companies could not be relied on to give vital information voluntarily. \"This undermines the government's strategy of weakening the Lords amendment and its efforts to introduce carbon budgeting.\"</p> <p>Kevin Smith, climate and finance campaigner at the environmental group Platform, said firms such as Shell were also undermining the efforts of thousands of people in Britain who were doing all they could to avert a climate crisis. He believed the government should intervene. </p> <p>\"We should be looking to regulate those institutions whose profitability is tied to increasing the amount of fossil fuels they extract,\" he said. \"This structure of shareholder return makes them unable to make meaningful emissions cuts.\"</p> <p>Neither Thomas Cook nor InterContinental Hotels were available for comment.</p>",
  "<p>David Triesman's proposals for formalising the Football Association's position as the game's regulator look likely to meet with such stiff resistance from Premier League clubs that they will threaten to withdraw their cooperation for the 2018 World Cup bid. </p> <p>The FA chairman's decision to develop a six-man bid-company board that contains only Manchester United's chief executive, David Gill, as a Premier League representative means it will be relying on the league's goodwill to tap into its global reach.</p> <p>But there are deep suspicions at the league's Gloucester Place HQ that Lord Triesman, a Labour peer, has been calling in favours within government in an effort to become the formal regulator for football. </p> <p>On Monday the sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, used parliamentary questions to call for a football review and reform of the fit-and-proper-persons tests that dictate who may own English clubs. Twenty-four hours later Triesman was able to set out his far-reaching proposals at the Leaders in Football conference.</p> <p>A direct challenge to Triesman's chairmanship of the FA has been ruled out as futile. The representatives on the FA's main board from the national game have broadly been impressed with his leadership, not least with his boldness at challenging the interests of the Premier League. </p> <p>And even the professional game delegates are split over Triesman. Brian Mawhinney's ties with Triesman were strengthened by the latter's politically astute co-option of the Football League chairman, himself a Tory peer, on to the World Cup 2018 board that Triesman leads.</p> <p><strong>Sheepshanks shines</strong></p> <p>David Sheepshanks harbours ambitions of becoming chief executive of the 2018 World Cup bid and yesterday's Leaders in Football conference at Stamford Bridge will certainly have done his credentials no harm. The Ipswich Town chairman, below, showed he is one of the best-connected figures in the football world with the range of delegates. The Asian Football Confederation's president, Mohamed Bin Hammam, will deliver an address today. Sheepshanks had a major influence on proceedings since he and the former executive director of the FA, David Davies, own a major stake in the conference organised by the former Soccerex director, James Worrall, through their company Alexander Ross. Sadly Davies and Sheepshanks could do nothing to prevent two fire alarms going off yesterday, delaying Triesman's keenly-awaited opening speech.</p> <p><strong>Burnham backs FA</strong></p> <p>The Premier League's suspicions of the joined-up thinking of the FA and the government will only have been deepened by an interview given to TalkSport yesterday by the culture secretary, Andy Burnham. \"We need a strong and reformed FA who is responsible from grass roots level to the England team,\" he said. \"They are the people who need to regulate the game in the interests of everybody.\" </p> <p><strong>Anger over China crisis</strong></p> <p>The Football Supporters Federation has responded to the globalised nature of the English game by speaking out for the billion or so in China who are unable to access footage of Premier League matches. During its last television rights sale, the league struck a deal with a pay-TV station that has only 300,000 subscribers. But the FSF, keen to see clubs' revenue streams develop without resort to playing competitive fixtures abroad, has challenged the move as short-termism. Now the league will consider extending the free-to-air rights sales it has in place in Africa to other markets as a \"strategic play\". But the FSF's opposition to the league's international round has not hit the target. The Premier League's chief executive, Richard Scudamore, will report back to clubs next February with proposals on how to revive the project.</p>",
  "<p>Insulting your mother's cooking can have grave consequences: last year, a court in Madrid ruled that a 36-year-old man who attacked his mother's skills in the kitchen must move out of her home and find his own place to live. </p> <p>But for many men, their mothers' cooking is a thing of beauty. During a recent episode of Masterchef: the Professionals, the (exclusively male) chefs were asked what gave them their passion for food. They all credited their mothers with providing them with basic skills, and the inspiration to work in a professional kitchen. In July, Antonio Carluccio spoke emotionally on Desert Island Discs about how his mother's cooking gave him the desire to become a famous chef. This year saw the US publication of Mom's Secret Recipe File, with stories and recipes influenced by the mothers of 34 celebrity chefs, and here in the UK Marcus Wareing's book How to Cook the Perfect ... was inspired by his mother's home cooking. </p> <p>Even Gordon Ramsay has romantically reminisced about his mother at the stove and bemoaned the cooking skills that ordinary people have lost since his parents' generation. \"I remember watching my mother cook, making ham hock barley soup, white veal stew, the most amazing honey-glazed roast ham,\" he said.</p> <p>The majority of cooking in the home is done by women, but only a tiny percentage of women are at the top end of the cooking business. However, for this week at least, mothers will rule in at least one professional kitchen. The London-based Caldesi restaurants and cookery school are running \"Italian Mamas Week\", during which the mothers of six members of staff will display their special style of home cooking. The mamas will be running cookery demonstrations at Caffe Caldesi and Cucina Caldesi in Marylebone and Caldesi in Campagna in Berkshire and advising on menus. </p> <p>The idea was sparked by head waiter Matteo Berghella. \"We were debating whose mother made the best spaghetti vongole, and Katie [Caldesi, co-owner with her husband Giancarlo of Caldesi] said, 'OK, let's bring them over to show us how to do it properly.'\"</p> <p>Head chef Monserrato Marini believes that most professional cooks learn their passion for food from their mothers. Marini's favourite recipe of his mama's is oven-baked lamb with sun-dried tomatoes and potatoes, a classic dish from Sardinia, where he was born.</p> <p>\"We make the original recipes more precise and more suited to a restaurant than a kitchen table,\" says Marini. \"But eating the food cooked by our mamas is a very different feeling to eating in restaurants, and very special.\"</p> <p>Sentimental stuff, but when the praise for mothers' cooking is coming from the mouths of successful male chefs, isn't it patronising and sexist? Chefs routinely lament the loss of good home cooking, and the fact that families seem to rarely eat together any more, but isn't this simply men telling women to keep their apron strings firmly tied? </p> <p>I spoke to the Caldesi boys' mothers as they were packing their aprons and preparing to come to show off their skills in London. Do mothers get the recognition they deserve for the quality of the food they produce in the home? \"No\", says Sabia Tortella, mother of Berghella. \"The sad reality in Italy is that husbands and sons don't really thank their mothers for their efforts.\" Another of the visiting mamas, whose son is a sous chef, also feels unappreciated for her cooking skills. \"In Italy being a housewife is undervalued,\" says Teresa Cottone. \"It isn't even considered being a job so we don't get enough recognition for what we do.\"</p> <p>Berghella certainly appreciates his mother's cooking now that he enjoys it as an occasional treat as opposed to on a daily basis. He tells me about his mother's cheese and egg balls, served with a tomato and sweet pepper sauce. \"It is the best thing she cooks,\" he says. \"She makes them with lots of garlic, parsley and bread crumbs, and deep fries them until they are crispy. Delicious!\"</p> <p>And did the mamas encourage their children to become chefs when they grew up? \"Are you kidding me?\" asks Nicoletta Salvato, mother of chef Marco Sarnie. \"No, I told my son I wanted him to be a billionaire.\" Chef Roberto Franzini's mother, Rina, thinks that her son's success is more down to growing up in a foodie environment than any direct encouragement from her. \"I just brought my children up surrounded by the culture of good food and they were good cooks as a consequence,\" she says.</p> <p>Do female chefs share this fondness for their mother's cooking? Helena Puolakka, Finnish head chef at Skylon restaurant in London's Royal Festival Hall, is a great advocate of her mother's cooking. \"Mealtime was so important to us when I was growing up,\" she says. \"The food that my mother cooked was enjoyed by us all together, and that had significance.\"</p> <p>Puolakka grew up in the countryside and would pick vegetables and catch fish with her mother prior to family mealtimes. \"That meant we were preparing food together, which obviously gave me a taste for cooking with the best and freshest ingredients, but home-style.\"</p> <p>So why are there so few women in the kitchens of top-end restaurants? Every chef, both male and female, I spoke to said it was down to the sheer physical challenge of the job. \"It is the stamina,\" believes Puolakka. \"You need to be a really tough cookie. But at the moment I employ five girls in my team, which is a lot.\" Marini agrees. \"Chefing is not easy for women. It is a very difficult, physical job, and the men in the kitchen are not very nice.\"</p> <p>At the Cucina Caldesi, Marini's mama is preparing to demonstrate her favourite family meal. An antipasto course of wild boar sausage with pecorino and artichokes will be followed by Sardinian pasta similar to couscous made with semolina in a clam sauce, porchetta with mirto (a local liqueur) and potatoes. Her finale is a classic Italian dessert made with cheese and honey. </p> <p>Oretta Pasto, whose son Simone Trombini is a chef at Caldesi, is careful not to brag about her skills. Or is she overshadowed by her son's professional status in the kitchen? \"I think I'm OK,\" she says, hesitantly. \"But I have learned all the cooking secrets in our family from my own mother. It is a family tradition.\"</p> <p>Whatever the mothers think of their own cooking skills, there will never be a shortage of chefs praising their family recipes, handed down for generations. For Berghella, and plenty more like him in the world of professional cooking, there is nothing to beat a mother's culinary skills. \"There is not a chef in the world that can make their food taste the same as their mama's,\" he says. \"They cook with love, the one ingredient nothing can replace.\"</p> <h2>Parmesan and parsley fritters</h2> <p>These are delicious little fried cheese balls that are crunchy on the outside and soft inside.

  "<p>In my past life as a private equity investor, my colleagues and I used to talk about how, despite the millions poured into the not-for-profit sector, social problems showed little sign of disappearing. Our hypothesis was that this was, in part, down to the structure and practices of charities: they were inefficient, suffered from a lack of leadership, were indecisive, and were reluctant to address problems of low organisational and staff productivity. The consultants, McKinsey, estimated that the sector in the US alone could free up $100bn in additional value by changing its operating practices. The voluntary sector, we believed, could benefit from the application of the disciplines of private sector management. </p> <p>Now that I've spent the last five years in the not-for-profit sector, do I still believe charities are cumbersome and inefficient? And can the private sector offer any solutions?</p> <p>I've certainly discovered that social problems are hugely complex, and that life in the charitable world is demanding and tough.</p> <p>Take funding: it tends to be volatile and short-term. This makes it hard to attract and retain good staff, if funding for salaries is uncertain. Investment tends to be for projects, not core costs, which can skew the activities of a charity and undermines its longer-term sustainability. This environment turns every charity chief executive into a fundraiser, with less time or ability to think strategically and long term - or, rather, to figure out how to reduce the mismatch between long-term social interventions and survival in a short-term funding environment. So, while there is inefficiency, at least some of the blame might be caused by the funding environment.</p> <p>If strong leadership is lacking, organisations can become lethargic and navel-gazing, obsessed with anticipating problems and doomsday scenarios, and stuck in \"analysis paralysis\". Without justifying this behaviour, I've come to realise that non-profit organisations may have a much more complex stakeholder \"grid\" than the private sector. Those stakeholders, more often than not, conflict at every fork in the road. For example, a decision to advocate on behalf of some public policy could easily and unintentionally become political, or a decision to work with certain key but \"unsexy\" beneficiary groups could alienate some funders.</p> <p>I have found many inspirational, courageous and effective leaders in the voluntary sector, and very capable people who work incredibly hard for little money. They are often achieving great things. But leadership alone is not enough. Leaders need the support and funding that will allow them to put organisational structures and skills in place so that effective social solutions can be scaled up for greater impact.</p> <p>This is where the private sector could help - with operational expertise, funding and shared best practices. It sounds simple and sensible, but it's not always so easy when sectors collide. In the late 1990s, some dotcom millionaires set out to \"fix non-profits\" with the omnipotent confidence that simply applying the same approaches that had made them lots of money in a very short time would equally quickly turn around social ills. They were well meaning, but held entirely the wrong attitude. Not surprisingly, social problems did not recede with their involvement, because method without depth of understanding is a waste of time. </p> <p>While there is benefit in translating (and the verb is to translate, not to transpose) skills and frameworks from the private into the not-for-profit sector, one cannot impose formulas, but rather must work collaboratively across sectors to find the best way to maximise social impact. At the Impetus Trust, we've found that helping the two to work together effectively is by far the best approach. </p> <p>Private sector expertise, delivered with careful guidance and direction from venture philanthropy specialists, is being used to help restructure charitable organisations, to review funding strategies and help implement new ones, to support rebranding and improvement in communications, to improve performance management and accountability, to restructure boards of trustees, and to develop new systems to monitor outcomes. This, combined with strategically deployed funding, is a winning combination for building capacity and multiplying social impact. </p> <p>The \"venture philanthropy\" model is rapidly catching on as one of the most effective forms of charity support. But it can only work if we use all our resources better and acknowledge that there is a lot of shared learning that can take place across sectors for the improvement of our lives. To start, we must ditch the preconceptions the private and charitable sectors have of each other. We must play our parts together.</p> <p>\u2022 Daniela Barone Soares is chief executive of venture philanthropy company Impetus Trust. <a href=\"http://www.impetus.org.uk\">impetus.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>There's a received wisdom that Greens don't do well in a recession. As the threat of unemployment pushes the environment out of voters' minds, green issues take a back seat. So it has proved in every recession. Except this one.</p> <p>I became leader of the Green party just two days after one of the most far-right administrations in US history was forced to nationalise nearly half of the country's mortgage market. The financial crisis we are entering has variously been described as the worst since 1978, '47, '33 and '29. And yet the Greens are continuing to climb in the opinion polls. </p> <p>People are coming to the realisation that the system of globalised markets - unregulated, unpoliced and unguided - is fatally flawed. Everyone agrees that we need to confront the failed corporate control of our economy, and restore it to democratic control. Everyone, that is, except the establishment parties in Westminster.</p> <p>Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have, bizarrely, chosen this moment to converge in support of the kind of neoliberalism that has caused this crisis in the first place. In doing so, they have abandoned not only common sense but also the majority of voters.</p> <p>Conversely, the Green party has seriously got to grips with the economic situation and is delivering practical solutions. We are more confident than ever in destroying the myth that we are a single-issue party. We are stepping into the gap left by parties that are now opposition in name only, exposing the economic and social failings of the establishment.</p> <p>The alternative we are providing is practical. Gordon Brown spent days haggling with energy barons to deliver a half-hearted, excessively means-tested response to fuel poverty. In Kirklees, Yorkshire, Green councillors delivered a universal free insulation scheme that will slash the bills of 40,000 households, while also creating jobs, providing training, and cutting carbon emissions.</p> <p>At national level too, Greens are helping to set an agenda for change. With a group of eight others, including the Guardian's Larry Elliot, I have co-authored a proposal for a Green New Deal to tackle what is, in reality, a 'triple crunch': economic recession, accelerating climate change, and rising oil prices underpinned by an encroaching peak in oil production.</p> <p>Like Roosevelt, who launched his New Deal during the Great Depression of the 1930s, we need to end the fairytale that the economy can look after itself, and all of us, through trickle-down and the invisible hand. The Green New Deal calls for the re-regulation of finance and taxation, cracking down on tax evasion, and de-merging the mega-banks into more containable entities, closer to the real economy, with retail banking separated from high finance. </p> <p>It also means investment in the infrastructure of tomorrow's economy. For 1930s America, that meant bridges and agricultural colleges. With climate change and peaking oil production, what we need today are home insulation, public transport and renewable energy. A 21st-century project to make the nation's buildings truly energy efficient, together with a revolution in renewable energies, would secure our energy supplies into the future, protect us against oil price fluctuations, re-invigorate our manufacturing sector and seriously address climate change.</p> <p>In addition to government funding, inducements for private investments from pensions and other savings would be introduced, to generate thousands of high-quality, green-collar jobs, revitalise money flows, loosen ties to unreliable oil markets and cut carbon emissions. </p> <p>The Green party is poised to send MPs to Westminster for the first time. In Brighton Pavilion, where I am standing, the most recent election results show we are now ahead of all the other parties. The same is true in Norwich South, where Adrian Ramsay, is on course to unseat Charles Clarke. And in Lewisham-Deptford, the deputy chair of the London Assembly, Darren Johnson, has turned one of the safest Labour seats in the country into a key battleground. It's my priority as leader to make sure we communicate to people that there is an alternative to a drab, fatalistic, neoliberal establishment.</p> <p>By offering universal free insulation to communities, we'll cut bills, create jobs, and start the work of creating a housing stock fit for a zero-carbon economy. By attacking poverty and pay, we'll address the inequality that blights lives - and stimulate the economy at the same time. </p> <p>\u2022 Caroline Lucas is leader of the Green party and a Green MEP.</p>",

  "<p>Benjamin Barber has been to the White House to advise Bill Clinton on civic engagement, flown to Libya to help Colonel Gadafy shape his democratic agenda, and has travelled the globe advising political leaders on civic society. So it is perhaps strange to find America's leading political theorist in Peterborough museum speaking to the city's civic leaders about their regeneration plans. </p> <p>Perception Peterborough, a public sector alliance that includes the council and the regional development agency, has enlisted Barber's help in planning how the city balances business and population growth. The 69-year-old professor led a series of seminars on the issue last month, and Peterborough's grand vision will be unveiled on October 22. With 16,000 eastern European migrants moving to the city since the EU expansion in 2004, and a \u00a31bn regeneration programme planned, it is all worthy stuff. But isn't he a tad overqualified for the job?</p> <p>Not at all, Barber insists. \"I worked with President Clinton, I worked with Howard Dean at the Democratic party, I worked with the German Social Democratic party, and I'm working now with Gadafy, but my deep interest in democracy means I do a lot of work at the neighbourhood and community level, where you feel that your ideas are more valuable and are taken more seriously than with the world leaders.\"</p> <p>It is timely that the veteran academic is advising on UK civic policy, given the renewed national focus on community issues from both the Tories and Labour. For more than three decades, Barber has argued that democracies rely on civil society - family, communities and voluntary organisations - as \"the free space in which democratic attitudes are cultivated and democratic behaviour conditioned\". He is president and director of the international pro-democracy charity CivWorld, and his 17 books include 1995's Jihad vs McWorld, a bestselling tome about how global corporations as well as traditional cultures threaten democracy. </p> <p>He waxes lyrical about Peterborough's public spaces, the pedestrianised shopping areas, and the market squares that remind him of the university city of Heidelberg in Germany. He admires the community's involvement in the city's future, with interest from residents, councillors, developers and housing organisations. \"My ultimate interest is not about presidents but in democracy,\" he stresses. \"And democracy is about people being empowered to take charge of their own lives and share in the powers that affect them. That is exactly what I see the potential for in Peterborough.\"</p> <p>Barber is the best known of the experts helping shape Peterborough's future. The others include Jan Gustav Strandenaes, environmental adviser to the UN, and Thailand-based community architect Patama Roonrakwit. The public sector is somewhat bereft of celebrities, but Barber has what can only be described as star power. Not many of his counterparts, for example, are mobbed by glad-handing fans (\"You're a star, Benjamin!\" exclaims one wide-eyed council officer). He is an impressive speaker, delivering a verbal tour de force at a machine gun pace and moving seamlessly from city centres to the philosophies of great thinkers such as Alexis de Tocqueville and John Stuart Mill, before winding up with an anecdote about Clinton.</p> <p>Ask Barber how he thinks the economic meltdown affects society, and his exasperation with \"the market\" is tangible. The crisis, he storms, is due partly to erosion by politicians of citizenship in favour of rampant consumerism. \"[Politicians say:] 'You need to stop being citizens and start being consumers! Tell us what you want. You want a house? You want to buy more?' We've seen in this economic meltdown the bankruptcy of the idea that we don't need citizens. What citizens would have done, had they involved themselves in this, would have been to insist on regulatory oversight and democratic surveillance. As citizens, we would have been able to contain the forces that have led to the meltdown.\" </p> <p>But all hope is not lost, as Barber suggests that the crisis might spark a civic renaissance. \"Just as the surrender to the myth of markets has created this meltdown, a reinvigoration of citizenship and civic pride, a belief in communities, can be part of creating a new foundation for democratic institutions,\" he says.</p> <p>In the 1990s, when Clinton was fresh to the White House and Barber was his informal adviser on democratic ideas, the professor felt then too that America was on the cusp of a civic revolution. At the time, he declared that the country was \"swinging back into an era of extraordinary opportunity\" for people who care about democracy and citizenship and think they are the key to the American future. Clinton's promise was never quite fulfilled, thanks to the Monica Lewinsky affair, and, as Barber asserts, the president's \"yielding to market ideology\". </p> <p>However, he paints a flattering picture of the ex-president in his 2001 book Clinton, The Truth of Power, admiring his \"intelligence, political savvy, and his remarkable personal charm\". It is impossible to imagine Barber ever being nervous, but his first encounter with the then president of the US left him stammering and unable to articulate his thoughts on civic responsibility. So how disappointed was he when the Clinton regime imploded in scandal? \"He squandered his charisma and power in fooling around with women,\" Barber says. \"What bothered me much more was his succumbing to the market mythology, because he had really embraced and stood for the civic ideology.\"</p> <p><strong>Off the map</strong></p> <p>In Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, Barber sees another opportunity \"to talk about community and responsibility\". He admires Republican candidate John McCain's ethic of service, but \"the problem is he sees it through the lens of the military\". Meanwhile, his dislike of McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, is clear: \"She's about Alaska and about business - she's off the map.\"</p> <p>Of UK policymakers' current focus on empowerment, Barber says there is much consultation, but citizens are not active stakeholders. \"They have the language, but not the reality. Look at the term 'community kitties'. It sounds like an allowance. It's very patronising.\" Compared to the federalised, devolved form of government in the US, Barber says the UK's \"unitary centralised state\" comes off worse.</p> <p>So does he have any advice on community issues for the prime minister? The plan for a youth centre in every community, for example, should mean professionals helping young people to shape the plans, rather than just creating the buildings for them. </p> <p>Barber's response is: \"Stop consulting, stop doing outreach, and start empowering. Start saying: 'You decide how you want to do it and what you want to do, and we'll support you.'\" </p> <p>Unlike some theorists, Barber outlines practical action to support his beliefs. Civic society, he says, needs public spaces, public art, civic use of IT and telecommunications, and a curb on the use of advertising that targets children. The charge by some critics that Barber's notions are utopian aggrieves him. \"I spend a lot of time working out how to make things politically relevant,\" he says. \"I think I am one of the few public intellectuals who actually has thought a fair amount about how you make ideas work.\"</p> <p><strong>Civic mantra</strong></p> <p>Given that Barber has championed his civic mantra since the 1970s, does he ever get frustrated that his theories are not widely adopted? </p> <p>He smiles, and replies: \"It used to frustrate me, but one virtue of growing older is that you get wiser, and one piece of wisdom is that we humans are all frail, that finding solutions to our challenges is difficult. I cut people more slack - myself included - than I once did.\" He says he concentrates on positive developments, such as the fact that Gadafy is becoming \"a poet of democracy\", and at least UK politicians are trying to work out how to empower citizens. Democracy, he says, demands patience and persistence. </p> <p>Barber returns to the subject of Peterborough. Medium-sized towns and cities, he says, are \"small enough to be rooted and connected and for people to know each other, but large enough to have transportation links to feel they are part of '' global world\". </p> <p>He is optimistic about the city's future. \"If it cannot happen here, I'm not sure it can happen at all,\" he says. \"Come the civic revolution, all eyes will be on Peterborough.\"</p> <h2>A life less ordinary</h2> <p>Self-proclaimed \"public intellectual\", author, scholar, public speaker, educational and political consultant - to leaders such as Muammar Gadafy - and playwright, Benjamin Barber was once described by the Washington Post as \"chronically busy\".</p> <p>Barber grew up in Greenwich Village, New York, and was educated at Switzerland's Albert Schweitzer College and the London School of Economics, graduating from Grinnell College, Iowa, in 1960. After an MA and a PhD in government from Harvard, he held teaching posts, including those at Princeton University, Rutgers University, and the University of Maryland, where is he currently professor of civil society.</p> <p>His famous political theory, from his 1984 book Strong Democracy, demands a participatory form of democracy, and his bestselling 1995 book, Jihad vs McWorld, catapulted him to international renown, particularly after September 11.</p> <p>Barber's other works - he has written 17 books - include Consumed: How Markets Corrupt Children, Infantalise Adults and Swallow Citizens Whole, a critique of capitalism, privatisation and consumerism, published last year.</p>",
  "<p>The government needs to act urgently to protect the British people against the economic turmoil that was not of their making, but is now resulting in them losing their jobs and struggling to pay their rent or mortgage and fuel bills.

But it's not just corrupt individuals who are responsible for these outflows: tax evasion and avoidance by multinationals cost developing countries billions of pounds a year too.</p> <p>On the same page, Larry Elliott argues that tackling \"the role of tax havens in undermining the policies of sovereign states ... will require the sort of global policy coordination so sorely lacking in recent years\". So it is astonishing that, as the UK government calls for a new global financial order based on transparency, it is seeking to have language on international tax cooperation removed from the outcome document of a key summit on financing for international development, to take place in Doha in November.</p> <p>Helping developing countries repatriate lost tax income will be an essential step if they are to build adequate, sustainable income bases in the long term. The financial crisis should not provide an excuse to reduce aid flows as Collier suggests.

  "<p>Peer beyond the wreckage of western financial systems and it may be possible to discern the outlines of the future. The end of the period of \"global capital markets\" and the \"financial services revolution\" is ushering in a new era - that of social business and investment.</p> <p>With the collapse of large financial players, the very nature of unfettered financial markets is being questioned. Although the full cost of the meltdown is not yet known, we can be sure that the bill will be picked up by the taxpayer.</p> <p>The banking system has been acting with an implicit state guarantee, for which the financial firms paid little - despite generating large sums for select employees and shareholders. Now that things have come unstuck, there is no recourse to the wealth that has been generated, which is a galling scenario for taxpayers. Their anger will be a feature of our political environment for many years to come.</p> <p>Another feature of the financial bailout is the massive expansion of government indebtedness, especially in the US. These debts need to be serviced, and eventually repaid. Against this backdrop, one can forget about expenditure on social programmes. </p> <p>The notion that society benefits so long as economic agents pursue pure profit-maximisation models and create wealth is now thoroughly discredited. So if the credibility of business has been seriously undermined, and government's role severely limited by resource constraints, where should we look? </p> <p>Civil society may have a role to play, but does it really possess the clout to address the scale of the problem? The answer would appear to come from an area that links all three main agents - state, private and civil - in our economy. The problem with the market-based system in its purest form was the complete absence of any social calculus. What we are now witnessing is likely to be the beginning of an economy where the full social impact of our businesses and our investments is taken into account. Signs of this trend have been evident for some time. A recent report by Eurosif, the Brussels-based trade body that encourages responsible finance, shows that, over the two years ending December 31 2007, socially responsible investment (SRI) funds in Europe have more than doubled to \u20ac2.7 trillion (\u00a32.12 trillion) - representing 17.5% of European investment assets. </p> <p>Two other asset classes with strong social return characteristics have also surged into the investment mainstream. Micro-finance has become an important feature in fixed-income portfolios, and alternative energy (\"cleantech\") is becoming a core part of equity investment. In 2007, cleantech investment amounted to roughly $150bn (\u00a3117 bn).</p> <p>At the smaller end of the scale, many new businesses have emerged, supported largely by individuals. These include retailer The Body Shop, online charity website Justgiving.com, the Ethical Property Company, which rents to social change organisations, Divine fairtrade chocolate, and a host of others. These businesses exploit the workings of the market to deliver tangible social benefits as well as financial returns. The fact that they generate financial surpluses means they are not dependent on the state or donors to conduct their activities - a very handy feature in the tough economic climate ahead. </p> <p>Charities will still play a vital role, but those dependent on state funding will be at risk. Both the voluntary sector and other civil society organisations will probably need to become more market-driven and entrepreneurial. </p> <p>Another indicator comes from leading business schools, where we can observe MBAs - a very astute, ambitious group - focusing on social business or \"social entrepreneurship\" as a potential profession. At the Judge Business School, Cambridge, I recently met a young man with a highly marketable background in bio-engineering who was \"definitely going into social business\", rather than taking the well-worn path of MBAs who sought to \"make money for 15-20 years and then give back to society\". When I asked why, his answer, without hesitation, was: \"Why waste those years?\"</p> <p>Jeremy, a friend of mine who is considered a leader in the international development field, once told me that he was taught throughout his career that the corporate sector was ill-intentioned, and that all possible solutions lie with resident experts from his world. I recall my former colleagues at Lehman Brothers saying similar things about the infinite wisdom of markets! Unlike my old Lehman friends, Jeremy is still employed. He is lucky, but also perhaps cleverer. He told me that he found that the only real solutions to today's intractable problems lie in using the wisdom of both the market and the development sector (and others).</p> <p>It is on such linkages that the social business and investment sector is based.

  "<p>The biggest shock for the social sector from Gordon Brown's cabinet reshuffle was Ann McGuire's departure from the Department for Work and Pensions.</p> <p>As minister for disabled people, she was thought to be successfully overseeing the introduction of James Purnell's welfare-to-work reforms. With employment and support allowance (ESA) set to replace incapacity benefit later this month for new claimants with a medical condition that prevents them from working or who need high-level support to get them ready for work, McGuire's return to the back benches, for reasons unknown, comes at a crucial time.</p> <p>She is succeeded by Jonathan Shaw, who until last week was a junior environment minister. Although he has no apparent track record in the area of disability, some will be reassured by the fact that, before entering politics, Shaw was a social worker for Kent county council. </p> <p>The exit of care minister Ivan Lewis, praised by the sector for his dogged championing of social care, was expected following his outspokenness about the government's wider record. </p> <p>However, Lewis's move to international development may not be the huge setback that many feared for the drive to personalise social services and the proposed reform of long-term care. Phil Hope, the energetic former charities minister, has been appointed to the newly-upgraded post of care services minister.</p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, may only just have found a desk in his newborn department, but he already has a crucial document to read at it. Yesterday's interim advice from the committee on climate change was short and strong: by 2050 Britain must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below 80% of 1990 levels, rather than the 60% cut now proposed in the climate change bill. This tougher target, the report says, must be written into the bill before it becomes law. On top of that, the 80% reduction needs to be made even harsher to compensate for emissions from international aviation and shipping, excluded from the existing 60% target.</p> <p>This excellent report is the first fruit of Britain's forthcoming climate change law. It comes from a committee proposed in the bill and set up at the start of the year, chaired by Lord Turner. Its report offers Mr Miliband no wriggle room. To his credit, he is not looking for any. The timing of publication is a hint that the advice will be followed. If the government had wanted to duck the challenge of an 80% target, the prime minister would not have mentioned it in his Manchester conference speech. Nor would he have created a new department to receive the report, headed by a minister who will not want to start his job by backing away from a move that Lord Turner insists is essential.</p> <p>There will soon be a series of parliamentary votes on the climate change bill, including one on a Liberal Democrat amendment that would extend the 2050 target from 60% to 80%. Mr Miliband must make it clear before then that he agrees with this - and so should the Conservative party, which has been waiting for Lord Turner's advice before deciding what to do. The prospects for political progress in Britain are good before next year's supposed global agreement at the Copenhagen summit. Opposition reshuffles, to match the new department, mean that climate change is now in the hands of three able politicians who do not want the issue to become a backwater: Mr Miliband, the Tories' Greg Clark and the Lib Dems' Steve Webb. </p> <p>Political agreement, though, will count for little unless the economics come right too. This is where there trouble lies. Yesterday the financial crisis saw Lord Turner drop his climate change hat and enter Downing Street to advise on the City meltdown instead. There has been a lot of confident talk about a market-driven response to climate change ever since Lord Stern's report argued that the costs of inaction made reducing carbon emissions economically rational. But markets are now in no position to achieve anything, rational or not. Nor are consumers likely to accept anything that pushes up their short-term costs. It was telling that the European parliament voted yesterday to ease the introduction of charges for carbon credits after 2013 - although coal-fired power generators will be charged from the start and there will be big investment in carbon storage technology. Of course a recession before then might cut carbon emissions by default. But it would also wreck the carbon trading scheme, which depends on thriving companies bidding up the price of credits they need, rather than shrinking ones selling off redundant credits to raise cash.</p> <p>The danger is that long-term targets and technological fixes will be used to disguise short-term reality. Action is needed immediately if there is any chance of a 2050 target being met - 60% or 80%. Making it as tough as possible is a virtuous thing to do. But it will mean nothing if emissions do not begin to fall. That will be a hard thing to convince voters of in a recession: Britain's last flirtation with green politics, in the late 1980s, did not last long when the economy turned sour. This time the government's commitment is more serious - and using less energy can be a way to save money. But voting for an 80% cut far in the future is the easy bit. The test is what happens now.</p>",
  "<p>The Football Association chairman, David Triesman, yesterday threatened to enforce a salary cap on England's leading clubs as part of a wide-ranging and often damning address on the game's finances.</p> <p>Setting out the FA's plans to become a stricter regulator for football and placing himself on a collision course with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a>, Lord Triesman attacked an industry that he said had run up \u00a33bn of debt, speaking of the \"very tangible dangers\" for the game at a time of much uncertainty in global finance. </p> <p>\"In the current climate it could be that we have to work out [wage] restraints and what they might be,\" he said during a speech to the Leaders in Football conference at Stamford Bridge. \"A sensible form of [wage] restraint would make sense and it is not inconceivable. It's very hard to do anything unless all parties want to do it and everyone needs to want to do it. Preferably without being compelled.\"</p> <p>Triesman's proposals will put the FA squarely at odds with the Premier League, particularly his ambitions for the governing body to become the English game's regulator. Senior government figures have this week been explicit that the FA's powers should be extended, and Uefa, the European governing body, is certain to offer support, having itself lobbied the European Commission to become football's statutory regulator.</p> <p>Triesman set out an ambitious manifesto for reform of the game's regulatory structure. \"I think we are too fragmented with too many bodies responsible for too many parts of the sport,\" he said. \"Greater clarity is needed about who is responsible for the fitness and future of the game. A clear sports law could clarify the position. The time has come for a comprehensive sports law apportioning responsibility and accountability.\" </p> <p>He also called for a strengthening of the fit-and-proper-persons test for club owners to include considerations of human-rights abuses alongside a prospective buyer's financial history. But most of his speech was given over to the volatility of the credit markets and its impact on English clubs. Triesman was referring to Manchester United when he talked of the \"impenetrable instruments\" of debt clubs have accrued. He said clubs must \"decrease their indebtedness\" by refinancing - although market conditions forbid most that luxury - or paying it down.</p> <p>In response the Premier League's chief executive, Richard Scudamore, compared Triesman's aversion to debt with that of the Uefa president, Michel Platini, who Scudamore claimed \"thinks all debt is bad\". Scudamore instead believes that borrowings are sustainable if they are in keeping with revenues. Despite the biggest anomaly of Manchester United, whose debts are \u00a3666m, he pointed out that the ratio of debt to earnings at Premier League clubs is broadly 1.1:1.</p> <p>But Scudamore was most strident in responding to Triesman's regulatory ambitions, insisting that the league should not yield to the whims of an organisation that is in some ways its commercial rival. \"We are like competitors,\" he said. \"We compete for sponsorship and for television rights and we are in the same space. </p> <p>\"The way it works here is tripartite. The Football League with its long reach, the Premier League with its different focus and different appeal and the FA all working together. If we draw three circles the overlap doesn't need to be huge.\"</p> <h2>FA ponders appeal</h2> <p>The FA may appeal against the paltry \u20ac14,000 fine Fifa handed Croatia last month. David Triesman will discuss it with Fifa's president, Sepp Blatter, after the racist abuse England's Emile Heskey suffered in Zagreb. Lord Triesman said: \"We want to make sure that in the international system racist abuse is dealt with effectively.\"</p>",
  "<p>British manufacturing output suffered its sixth consecutive monthly contraction in August, its worst run since 1980 and confirmation that the economy had already gone into recession, according to a leading economic thinktank.</p> <p>The poor figures came amid more calls for the Bank of England to cut interest rates by at least half a point tomorrow in response to growing evidence that the global financial crisis has pushed the economy into recession.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output fell 0.4% in August from the previous month - twice the drop expected by City economists - and was down 1.9% on a year ago, the biggest annual drop in more than five years. Production has fallen every month since March. The last time output was down for such an extended period was between July and December 1980.</p> <p>The manufacturing sector has suffered stagnating output for more than a decade and the strong pound over much of that period has led firms to shed more than a million jobs. Last year the sector enjoyed a brief resurgence but that faded as the eurozone economies - the destination of half of Britain's goods exports - slowed. </p> <p>The slump in output has occurred in spite of a 12% fall in the pound's value against the euro, which had encouraged the Bank of England to believe that industry might take over from the consumer as the main driver of the economy.</p> <p>The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said it had calculated that overall gross domestic product contracted by 0.2% in the third quarter of this year. \"This is the first fall of output in a calendar quarter that we have identified since we started producing our series in 1998. Unless output growth resumes in the near future, it will be reasonable to say that a recession began in May of this year,\" said Martin Weale, NIESR director.</p> <p>\"In view of these figures and of the intensifying banking crisis, we take the view that the Bank of England should cut the interest rate by 0.5%.\"</p> <p>Economists said the latest data was very disappointing, even though a British Chambers of Commerce survey out yesterday had pointed to a huge drop in profits, output and confidence in the sector.</p> <p>\"It's a lot worse than the markets were expecting. The slowdown shows that the UK economy is suffering on all fronts,\" said David Page, an economist at Investec, \"We expect worse to come.\" </p> <p>The ONS figures showed that the transport sector, which includes car manufacturing and shipbuilding, was particularly hard hit, with a 2.3% slump.</p>",
  "<p>For better or worse - all right, for worse - the premier political icons of my early adulthood were Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Locked into a scorched earth campaign against liberal values, for me and for others they hung over the world like a cross between a biblical curse and a terrifically bad smell. They were bitterly hated, deep from the heart, and often sincerely wished dead. I wonder how many of us would have wished dementia upon them? </p> <p>Thatcher is, apparently, in the early stages. And Ronald Reagan has gone public; his PR machine's announcement of his illness may have consisted of mushy pieties, but it was the right thing to do and deserves respect. The more we bring the illness out of the shadows it is hidden in the better.</p> <p>The bestselling novelist Terry Pratchett has given dementia a high profile in this country recently. He has swerved past the mushy (memorably describing his dementia as \"an embuggerment\") and found some positives, too. His account of an instant of acceptance of the illness and of his own place in the world managed, inspiringly, to combine optimism, common sense and spirituality.</p> <p>At the Tory party conference last week he took the opportunity to ask why there was \"no government of any stripe in England ... willing to put its money where its mouth is and fund changes\" around dementia. It's a good question. It's not as if politicians themselves are magically exempt from dementia, as Thatcher and Reagan show.</p> <p>As it happens, this government has the best record of any I remember on dementia. Ivan Lewis, care minister until the weekend reshuffle, worked hard and won respect. Work on a dementia strategy proceeds apace, and that's crucial. If Gordon Brown's reference to dementia in his conference address was no clarion call, it still heartened professionals used to deafening silence and offered hope to people with dementia and their carers. The Treasury seems to have realised that if we don't manage dementia sensibly we're all going to hell in a handcart. </p> <p>So far so good, then. But it's not enough. Why isn't a serious political fuss being made? As Pratchett pointed out, quoting a recent Alzheimer's Society report, dementia easily tops the list of conditions that people over 55 fear - and yet 72% of people across the country feel that political parties have no clear plans for older people. </p> <p>The 72% are right. You can't get a fag paper between the Westminster parliamentary parties' policies on older people at the moment. This is astonishing given that care issues had such a high profile in and high impact on the election of the last Scottish parliament. It's even more astonishing given that politicians are acutely conscious of how much they are relying on the grey vote.</p> <p>With the prospect of a potentially close-fought election in the offing and a general sense that the public as a whole is sick to the back teeth of policy-free politics, the Westminster parties are desperate to put clear water between one another. Why are they missing this chance for a proper political punch-up? </p> <p>In an ideal world, we would get visionaries - preferably one each for all the major parties. We'd have these visionaries warm up with some stretching exercises on the role of assistive technology and individual budgets, moving into some light oppositional sparring around how they would ensure dementia is diagnosed as early as possible and which drugs should be available on prescription to help people cope. We could watch them move on to some fierce, probing ring work on whether dementia should be considered an illness, the responsibility of the health services, free at the point of treatment. They could then really stir us up by showing some passion about the plight of carers, and move in for the kill on upping the proportion of gross national product to be spent on older people and those of us helping them. </p> <p>If politicians were really feeling brave they might try talking about how we help tackle the problem globally. I passionately loathed Thatcher and Reagan but they didn't shrink from the global - or from punch-ups. There's an urgent need for the same energy here. </p> <p>\u2022 Chris Manthorp is a director of services for older people, working in the voluntary sector. He is writing in a personal capacity</p>",
  "<h2>A bridge too far</h2> <p>London's mayor has a tough decision to take on the proposed motorway-scale Thames Gateway bridge. Either he pushes ahead with this \u00a3500m gorilla - which a public inquiry showed conclusively would bring congestion and pollution, but little regeneration, to east London - or he plucks up courage and overrides the road-building instincts of the big business community. Last week, he sounded like he had remembered his manifesto pledge to scrap plans for the bridge. Having been heckled by some of his strongest critics at a Transport for London board meeting, he adjourned the debate, invited one of them to have her say, and then said: \"Come back to the next meeting. I think you'll find that matters on that front are evolving.\" </p> <h2>Reclaim the beach</h2> <p>Landowners lucky enough to have lengths of coastline on their land are steaming that they will not be allowed to appeal against people being allowed to walk over it, under the new right of public coastal access, and will get no compensation if they lose out financially. \"It is absurd, unjust and unfair that the government has rejected an independent right of appeal,\" wails Henry Aubrey-Fletcher, chair of the Country Land and Business Association. But others would say it is \"absurd, unjust and unfair\" that people can't appreciate some of Britain's most beautiful land. </p> <h2>Woman of the week</h2> <p>Prize for the most impressive woman in Britain this week could go to Anita Rivas, an inspirational Ecuadorean who was in London to see the government and fight for the preservation of the extraordinarily rich Yasun\u00ed national park. This Amazonian treasure should be protected, but Argentine, French and local oil companies have started drilling, and a worldwide campign against them has started. \"If we keep the oil below the ground, not only will we conserve an enormously diverse area, home to many indigenous people, but also we will become a universal symbol that a new world is possible,\" said Anita. Shame that the new Department of Energy and Climate Change could not find time to see her.</p> <h2>Too much hot air</h2> <p>Philip \"Dotty Stotty\" Stott, emeritus professor of geography at London University, has been quiet of late, but Eco Soundings' favourite climate change sceptic has come up with a list of new ministers who will be needed in the new climate change department. \"Minister for cosmic ray fluxes, solar magnetic cycles, and sunspots; minister for meteorites and cosmic dust; minister of state for the Earth's orbit, tilt, wobble, shape, and rotational velocity; minister of state for water vapour, clouds, and atmospheric gases; and parliamentary under secretary of state for carbon dioxide and methane, both natural and anthropogenic.\" And how about a minister to control contrarian gibberish? </p> <h2>Bypass blues</h2> <p>A bypass round Alderley Edge has been proposed for more than 25 years, but for the last decade it's been assumed that the small Cheshire town would not get one. This is because it is in the constituency of George Osborne, the Tory shadow chancellor, and when has a Labour administration ever wanted to chuck money at one of the truest and bluest of all England's constituencies? But perhaps the three-mile road is actually designed to make Mr Osborne look like a spendthrift who does not understand the environment. According to the Department for Transport, the single-lane road he has been lobbying for will cost \u00a317m a mile and will expose at least 250 homes to more noise.</p>",
  "<p>With one in five people in South Africa living with HIV and Aids, and most of them poor, by custom and necessity many have turned to traditional medicines, putting intolerable strain on the once bountiful supply of plants. These include the cancer bush, the daisy-like wild cineraria, and the sore eye flower, whose monstrous black bulbs were once used by bushmen to poison their arrows but are also used to stop bleeding and to heal wounds.</p> <p>The looming loss of plantlife has led to a partnership between traditional healers in urban townships around Grahamstown and the genteel calm of the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, west London. The result is Africulture, a pilot project to encourage healers to cultivate the 30 most important plants they use, rather than harvest them in the wild. And so far it's working, says Stephen Hopper, Kew's director. \"It alleviates the pressure on the wild services and gives people a way to help themselves.\"</p> <p>The scheme embodies the priorities of a new 10-year strategy, the Breathing Planet programme, just published by the world-famous botanical gardens: protection and restoration of habitats, a stronger focus than ever on the threat of climate change, and a clearer emphasis on the fact that ultimately their work is to protect people who are dependent on the plants. </p> <p>This is less a radical new direction, more a natural evolution of Kew's founding principles in 1759, says Hopper. \"Now we're less focused on bringing in the world's plants to Kew and developing economic advantage from that, [and more on] forming partnerships with people throughout the world and working collaboratively with them on the science of plants.\"</p> <p>Hopper, a plant biologist from Western Australia, who has \"described\" for science more than 300 species, has that vaguely teasing knack some scientists have of outlining profoundly exciting ideas with the calm of somebody checking catalogue references. He says: \" If you look at your meals today, there's a strong possibility that half of what you consumed was plants. If you look at the medicines, there's a reasonable prospect one-third or up to half are derived from plants. </p> <p>\"The fact that we have got not only clean air to breathe but productive soil and clean water to drink we owe to the services plants provide,\" he adds.</p> <p>The questions are: \"Will one plant do? Do we need the diversity?\" continues Hopper rhetorically. Different species are adapted to different habitats; humans cannot know what species will be important in future. </p> <p>The twin themes of people and environmental threats are introduced from the very first words of Kew's Breathing Planet programme: \"People everywhere strive to improve their quality of life. But we are all living on borrowed time, putting far too much pressure on the natural resources on which we depend.\" The destruction of forests which absorb carbon dioxide and provide food and oxygen to support living creatures and moderate the climate is now one of the world's biggest environmental disasters, it continues. </p> <p>Faced with such an entrenched, amorphous global problem it's hard to see how Kew can help, but Hopper insists it can contribute to both mitigating the problem by reducing the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to change.</p> <p>The first three sections of the Breathing Planet programme are about mitigation. Nearly one-fifth of the build-up of CO\u00b2 emissions comes from deforestation, so the starting point is supporting conservation programmes. Recent successes included Madagascar, where the government committed to trebling protected national parks, and Cameroon, where scientists realised what was thought to be insignificant rainforest is the richest for plantlife in Africa, prompting the government to pledge new nature parks there . </p> <p>The second part of the strategy is about adaptation: starting with an ambitious pledge to extend the work of the Millennium Seed Bank to collect examples of one in four of the 220,000-430,000 plant species in the world by 2020. There is also more emphasis on growing \"locally appropriate species\" whether that's reintroducing traditional crops or the Africulture scheme, run jointly with local organisations Garden Africa and Umthathi.</p> <p>For the final strand of the strategy Kew had an envious look at its more gregarious cousin, the Eden Project in Cornwall, and wants to become visitor friendly for its 1.5m annual guests, recruiting an \"army\" of several hundred volunteer guides.</p> <p> \"It's difficult for a lay person to break through all the science jargon and understand the excitement and interesting connections and uses, and the fundamental role plants play in our lives, so there has to be an interpretation of the science ... in an engaging way.\"</p>",
  "<p>On Sunday at the world's richest football club, no fans could be spotted with tea-towels on their heads, but delirium lingers on. It remains surreal to read in the programme at a Manchester City match against Liverpool that it was: \"The first home game for our new owners, led by His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, represented by our new chairman, His Excellency Khaldoon Al Mubarak.\"</p> <p>With City 2-0 up before Liverpool's masterly fightback, City's fans launched into \"We're not really here\" - though not in disbelief at seeing Robinho in a sky blue shirt now; the anthem was minted during City's season in the old Division Two 10 years ago by fans finding themselves on terraces at clubs like Macclesfield and York. The fans' immovable loyalty in that third-flight season cemented City's status as a big club and legitimised the local council's decision to hand City the new publicly funded stadium after the 2002 Commonwealth Games, and those two factors made City, for all its unpredictability, eminently desirable to buy.</p> <p>Since the hysteria fired by Sulaiman Al Fahim, Sheikh Mansour's dealmaker, bragging of \"very deep pockets\" and talking fantasy football, a more respectful tone is marking City's new era. In an open letter to \"fellow Manchester City fans\", Sheikh Mansour stressed loyalty to the manager, Mark Hughes, an understanding that \"it takes time to build a team\", the importance of the academy and homegrown players, an appreciation of City's history and a commitment to the community work the club's staff do in some of Manchester's grim neighbourhoods.</p> <p>The letter emphasised that although Sheikh Mansour is a member of Abu Dhabi's ruling dynasty, he has bought City \"in a private capacity\", part of his \"strategy to hold a wide portfolio of business investments\". Few, though, doubt that the acquisition of a major Premier League club is part of the broader moves to enhance the national appeal of Abu Dhabi itself. </p> <p>A central figure working on the City takeover for Mansour, alongside Khaldoon, has been Simon Pearce, an English expatriate who is the strategic communications director of the Executive Affairs Authority, a policy arm of the Abu Dhabi government. </p> <p>In November 2007 Pearce, who is thought certain to join the City board, oversaw a new campaign to attract tourism and business partners to the emirate, launching a corporate brand for Abu Dhabi itself. The Office of the Brand of Abu Dhabi emphasises above all, and in detail down to the livery of taxis, that the emirate should be synonymous with: \"Respect, for heritage, family, culture and tradition, for the environment and business, and above all, respect for each other.\"</p> <p>The brand also stresses continuity for Sheikh Mansour's Al Nahyan dynasty, which has ruled Abu Dhabi since the 18th century: \"Respect for leadership which has guided us over the lifetime of our emirate.\"</p> <p>Insiders say it was Pearce who stepped in after Al Fahim's loadsamoney pronouncements and steered the tone back to dignity. The owners won friends at City particularly after Khaldoon spent time with the academy director, Jim Cassell, and on Sunday for inviting former greats into the directors box, including Tony Book and Colin Bell, who were not always given similar prominence by more local owners. </p> <p>Dr Christopher Davidson of Durham University, author of a forthcoming book Abu Dhabi: Oil and Beyond, believes the City acquisition, following the sponsorship of Ferrari's formula one team and investment in top-end sports events and the arts, chimes with this promotion of Abu Dhabi. \"Although the emirate has enormous wealth, they need good relations around the world, to invest their money profitably, and to attract western partners. It is a liberal Muslim country, and although there is no democracy, it is generally peaceful, with the Al Nahyans seen as spending their money generously.\" Davidson added, however, that \"human rights are a blackspot\" - Amnesty International has raised concerns about detention and treatment of migrant workers in the UAE. \"Buying City presents a friendly image,\" he said, \"that these are good guys, who like football, and Abu Dhabi is a safe place to visit and do business.\"</p> <p>Sheikh Mansour, Davidson says, is up and coming among the 19 sons born to Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's long-term ruler who died in 2004. Mansour's mother, Sheikha Fatima, had six sons, which made hers the ruling family's most influential \"mother block\" compared with Sheikh Zayed's other wives. Mansour's influence has grown - he chairs the International Petroleum Investment Company, one of the larger sovereign wealth funds. </p> <p>The family's wealth, indistinguishable with that of the emirate, is almost limitless, with a round $1tn estimated in overseas assets alone. Manchester City is a tiny sliver of that, but bigger than almost anything in terms of publicity, hence the care being taken now to strike the right tone. </p> <p>Neither side has confirmed officially the final price paid by Sheikh Mansour, but informed sources say the total for the club and its debts was close to the originally reported \u00a3210m. Thaksin Shinawatra is understood to have made a \u00a320m profit on the \u00a321.5m he paid for the club. So, with Mansour having paid just over \u00a340m for the club itself, that leaves \u00a3170m of the purchase price made up of City's debts. Companies House documents indicate that Thaksin had \u00a345.3m in loans outstanding personally. According to their most recent accounts, City owed \u00a341m in loan notes, a further \u00a342.4m provided for future stadium rent to the council, and City borrowed \u00a325m from Standard Bank in July this year. Those borrowings, including Thaksin's, add up to \u00a3154m, leaving around \u00a316m other debts. </p> <p>Thaksin, now honorary president of City, stopped funding the club with \u00a3800m of his assets frozen and criminal proceedings continuing in Thailand. Last month the Thai supreme court did not deliver a verdict as expected on the corruption charge against him, and has instead issued four arrest warrants for him to return. According to reports, he has applied for political asylum here. </p> <p>Few at City doubt that Thaksin used the club in his political fight to boost his profile and enable him to return home freely. That failed, and he is now yesterday's man, even at Eastlands, supplanted by the reign of Al Nahyan. </p> <p>In his superb book Manchester: A Football History, Gary James writes of City's beginnings that the club was established in 1880 by the rector's daughter at St Mark's Church, to provide poor, scrapping young lads with something wholesome to do in wretched east Manchester, the smoky side of the world's first industrial city. Now industry is gone and east Manchester's regeneration is based around the football stadium itself and new housing. Sheikh Mansour's bold purchase of the Manchester club happened just as the post-industrial economy, reliant on credit and consumption, was slumping into banking collapse. </p> <p>For all the delight among City fans, there is clearly discomfort within the FA and football generally about so much wealth pouring into one club from a member of a country's government. City's takeover symbolises the wider phenomenon, of world financial power shifting from our credit-exhausted land to east Asia, where they actually make things, and the Middle East, where families who ruled for generations had the great good fortune to discover they were sitting on oil.</p> <h2>Cash for cachet</h2> <p>In the Abu Dhabi \"Brand Briefing\", Simon Pearce, the director of strategic communications for the emirate's Executive Affairs Authority and now a key figure at Manchester City, said \"sponsorships or associations\" should \"epitomise Abu Dhabi\".

The adverts also portrayed speed in a way that may have encouraged irresponsible driving, the watchdog said. The campaign for the Lexus RX400h hybrid, headlined: \"Put your carbon foot down\", included the vehicle's emissions in the small print and claimed it was \"better for the environment\".

British Energy, which has agreed a \u00a312.5bn tie-up with France's EDF, said output was in line with management expectations. Outages at several plants have curbed its ability to generate electricity but several units are expected to come back on line in the next three months. <br><strong>Mark Milner</strong></p> <h2>Protests force Tata to shift Nano to new Gujarat plant</h2> <p>The Nano will be built in the western Indian state of Gujarat after weeks of violent protests forced Tata Motors to relocate production from West Bengal, where its \u00a3200m factory was close to opening. \"We now have a new home,\" said the firm's boss, Ratan Tata, days after the collapse of talks to end the protests by displaced farmers in Bengal.

The new \u00a3237m factory, which Tata says will generate 10,000 jobs, will be housed on 445 hectares in Sanand, outside Ahmedabad. <br><strong>Associated Press</strong></p>",
  "<p>Yell, owner of Yellow Pages classified business directories, shrugged off the gloom in the global financial markets yesterday by successfully clinching a crucial refinancing of its \u00a33.7bn of debts.</p> <p>The deal will see the company's syndicate of banks and other lenders, headed by HSBC, share just over \u00a318m in fees, while Yell's annual interest payments will rise by about \u00a335m in exchange for a relaxation of the covenants attached to the facility. </p> <p>Yell admitted last month that it would have to renegotiate its overdraft, which still has three years to run, because the worsening economic climate meant the profit assumptions made when it was introduced several years ago look too optimistic.</p> <p>The company used the cash to make major acquisitions in the US and Spain to complement its commanding position in Britain, which Yell inherited when it was spun out of BT. Both markets have subsequently experienced a slowdown.</p> <p>Intense speculation about Yell's finances has caused a dramatic fall in its share price, which is down more than 80%. The company was ejected from the FTSE-100 index of leading shares earlier in the year and is now worth just \u00a3775m - or roughly a fifth of the size of its debt.</p> <p>Although the company was not in immediate danger of breaching its banking covenants, it had wanted to increase its headroom in case the economic climate worsens or it has the chance to make other opportunistic acquisitions. To help pay its debts faster and reassure lenders, Yell axed its dividend payment to shareholders last month.</p> <p>The company's banking covenants are partly based on the number of times Yell's profits before financial charges (Ebitda) can cover its debts. At the end of June that ratio stood at 4.9 and the company expected to report flat earnings because of the general economic gloom.</p> <p>The company said it would suspend dividends until its debt came down to four times its Ebitda. Analysts expect that to happen sometime in 2010.</p> <p>Yell stressed that the revised covenants it has secured gave the company \"20% headroom against its forecasts\". The interest rate on the facilities has been increased by 1 percentage point, which means its expected payment for next year is likely to increase to about \u00a3290m.</p>",
  "<p>At 2.30pm yesterday afternoon, shares in the Royal Bank of Scotland were down by 40%, Iceland was still teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and the wider global economy was, by common consent, in a headlong rush towards meltdown. Meanwhile, in Newmarket, a handsome, well-related yearling colt by Oasis Dream was about to walk into the main sales ring at Tattersalls. Nine minutes later, the hammer came down at 500,000gns. Welcome to Planet Tatts, where the crunch is confined to the Caesar salad.</p> <p>The market in dreams, apparently, is more recession-proof than most, and at Tattersalls, they have been buying and selling hope for centuries. The dreams at the October Yearling Sale, meanwhile, are as big as they come. This is Europe's premier bloodstock auction, and three future Derby winners have passed through its ring in the last four years alone. If you want to find a horse for the Classics, the October Sale is the obvious place to start. </p> <p>A total of 610 lots are in the catalogue for the most exclusive part of the sale, which ends on Wednesday, with 203 scheduled for their brief turn in the ring yesterday. In one door and out the other, with a new owner and hopefully a five- or six-figure price tag, is how it has always worked, and for all the prevailing gloom in the financial markets, yesterday was little different. </p> <p>Each time the hammer came down, it was a small testament to the power of optimism in uncertain times. Last year, 639 yearlings were offered in the first part of the October Sale, and 510 found new homes, at an average price of 127,298gns: four lots went for a million guineas or more, with the top lot, a filly by Sadler's Wells, going for 2.5m guineas. As breeders and potential owners arrived in Newmarket yesterday, the question in every mind was whether the prices would hold up.</p> <p>The first lot, a chestnut filly by Pivotal, sold for 150,000gns, which rather suggested that the answer might be yes. The Coolmore operation moved into action as early as lot 4, a bay colt by Sadler's Wells, who went for 280,000gns, and their great rival Sheikh Mohammed, represented by the bloodstock agent John Ferguson, responded immediately with a successful bid of 200,000gns for a colt by Cape Cross.</p> <p>\"It would be pretty peculiar if the market were not affected by what's going on in the outside world, as every other market has been,\" said Michael Bell, whose Derby winner, Motivator, was bought at the October Sale for just 75,000gns. \"But the top end does appear to be pretty resilient. The big battalions have got a lot behind them, and if there's a shortage of punters it is going to be in the middle market. </p> <p>\"People are thinking, do they want to buy a new car, pay the school fees or buy a racehorse, and obviously the racehorse is not going to be priority number one. But from a buyer's point of view, it is cheaper, so to some extent you could argue that it makes more sense to have your money in a potentially high-class racehorse than it does in a bank that might go tits up.\" </p> <p>Harry Herbert, who is both a breeder via Highclere Bloodstock and a syndicate manager via Highclere Thoroughbred Racing, was duly playing both sides of the market yesterday. \"The nice horses are selling really well,\" he said, \"but it's a bit more spotty underneath that. There's not the strength in depth at 100,000gns and more - but then if you turned on the news, you'd never buy a horse at all.</p> <p>\"Overall, I'd say that we will probably be one syndicate down on last year, which isn't a disaster, but there's definitely a bit more resistance in the market now.\" </p> <p>A truer test of the health of the bloodstock market may be the second part of the October Sale next week, when the real bread-and-butter horses will appear. For now, though, Tattersalls' executives seemed satisfied with a first-day average of nearly 120,000gns, for all that the sale still awaits its first million-guinea lot. </p> <p>\"Of course, there's going to be an effect with all the City boys missing out on their bonuses, and the only question is how much,\" Jason Singh, Tattersalls' marketing manager, said, \"but if it holds up like it has so far, we'll be very pleased.\"</p>",
  "<p>MPs and peers returned to Westminster this week to confirm what Labour MPs hoped and Conservative colleagues feared on the party conference circuit last month: that the economic crisis has changed politics once again. As Ruth Kelly put it in an exit interview: \"Gordon has regained the permission of the electorate to be heard again.\" Tory MPs agree.</p> <p>That does not give him carte blanche to throw his weight around. Far from it. At Monday night's first meeting of the Parliamentary Labour party (PLP), so many present report, July's dispirited mood had given way to renewed hope and a sense of unity of purpose. One likely casualty of that mood will be the prime minister's commitment to increasing pre-charge detention limits from 28 to 42 days. It is set out in the latest counter-terrorism bill.</p> <p>No 10 is not yet saying Gordon Brown is throwing in a towel in which he has invested a lot of political capital since succeeding Tony (defeated over 90 days) Blair. But many who wish him well confidently believe that will happen when (not if?) a cross-party vote in the Lords, no longer the reactionary bastion of old, rejects the proposal on Monday night. </p> <p>Normally that would result in end-of-session ping-pong between both houses. But times are no longer normal. David Cameron and George Osborne realise the electorate now regards the global crisis as sufficiently serious to make routine party skirmishing a luxury. Resourceful though they are, they must now engage in \"me-too-ism\", never much fun for an opposition.</p> <p>On 42 days, Brown's problem is with his own party. On Monday night Barry Sheerman called on ministers to concentrate on the economy and avoid divisive issues. Patricia Hewitt specifically raised 42 days, though she voted for it reluctantly when it scraped through the Commons by nine votes in June. </p> <p>Critics say Brown should use a Lords defeat as an excuse to concede the consensus he expected has failed to materialise after a host of police chiefs, law chiefs, prosecutors and spies joined civil libertarians in saying it was not needed. Revised procedures - including lower charging thresholds and post-charge questioning - give the retreat respectable underpinning. But unity is the key.</p> <p>It will not stop there. More than 100 Labour MPs have declared in favour of a total ban on smacking, even by parents, but Nick Brown, the retread new chief whip, will not allow them a free vote on such a divisive issue in tonight's vote on the children and young persons bill. MPs campaigning to use the human fertilisation and embryology bill to liberalise abortion laws will also get short shrift.</p> <p>By the same token, MPs expect Alistair Darling to use his pre-budget report to drop his high-minded attempt to tax older, dirtier cars off the road. If the Lords amends the planning bill to ensure an accountable minister, not an unelected planning board, makes final decisions on power station sites and even airport runways, ministers may have to bow.</p> <p>It may not be a government of national unity yet, but all sides are pulling punches.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Kinnear believes Fabio Capello erred in omitting Michael Owen from the England squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Belarus. \"I only hope England do not lose either of those two games and people don't turn round and say leaving Michael Owen out was not the best thing to do,\" said Newcastle United's interim manager yesterday.</p> <p>\"I was surprised to hear Michael was not in the England squad. His goal record is light years ahead of some of those who are in. Even if he had been on the bench for the World Cup games, Michael would have been an asset because he can assess situations very well.\"</p> <p>Kinnear is relishing working with Owen at Newcastle and said: \"I would stake my life on Michael Owen. I have to say England's loss will be our gain.\"</p> <p>Dismissing fears that such a \"terrific blow\" to the striker might impact negatively on his club, Kinnear said: \"Michael is a very proud lad, he loves playing for his country and will obviously be disappointed at being left out. </p> <p>\"But he is a terrific professional and I know there will be no need for me or any of my coaching staff to lift his morale. His disappointment won't affect Newcastle.\"</p> <p>Owen could soon be coached by Gerry Francis. The former Tottenham manager, who is currently the subject of a tug of war between Stoke City and Newcastle, has been offered two days' work a week on Tyneside and Kinnear is hoping to have an answer by the weekend.</p> <p>The interim manager has been talking to Mike Ashley and said Newcastle's owner had told him \"six\" consortiums were interested in buying the club and \"all bids have to be in by October 17\".</p> <p>Freddy Shepherd, Newcastle's former chairman, believes legitimate purchasers may prove elusive and said yesterday: \"The last I heard, from someone in the City, was that the club has had 100 applications but 99 have been barking mad.</p> <p>\"Getting the right person in is going to be difficult. The credit crunch will be impacting on potential buyers as much as anyone. It doesn't matter who they are. The global markets are in turmoil.\"</p> <p>Shepherd does not feel Ashley can anticipate a healthy return on his investment. \"No one's going to give him a huge profit now,\" he said. </p> <p>\"You don't have to be a rocket scientist to work that one out. And whoever's going to buy the club will know they are going to have to buy players in January.\"</p> <p>If not, Newcastle could be deep in relegation danger and, said Shepherd: \"If Ashley doesn't sell by January, he's going to have to strengthen the team. That's why he will be aiming to sell before the transfer window opens.\"</p>",
  "<p>The time for half-measures is over. Britain is no longer in the grips of a credit crunch or even a financial crisis; it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/07/creditcrunch\">is suffering a full-on financial heart attack</a>. Markets <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/07/usa.creditcrunch\">have seized up</a>. Banks will no longer lend to each other. Credit to companies and individuals is drying up. Unless credit starts flowing again soon, a nasty recession \u2013 conceivably even a depression \u2013 looms and with it, massive job losses, bankruptcies, repossessions and a sharp fall in living standards. The government needs to act \u2013 now.</p> <p>But what to do? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/25/labour.conservatives\">Ken Livingstone</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/25/labour.gordonbrown\">Seumas Milne</a> and others argue that the government should turn its back on market economics. Since capitalism seems to be collapsing under the weight of its internal contradictions, the government should finish it off. More measured voices such as the TUC's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/06/creditcrunch.labour\">Brendan Barbour</a> favour a ragbag of measures, such as a new industrial policy. But all of them are missing the point. Righting the huge problems in financial markets certainly requires decisive government intervention, but lashing out at generally well-functioning product and labour markets is perilously misplaced. The last thing a heart-attack victim needs is to have a healthy leg amputated. The priority now is tackling the financial crisis; everything else is a dangerous diversion. </p> <p>But while the government should not try to turn the clock back to the 1970s, it does need to change course. Its ad hoc approach will no longer do. The nationalisations of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, and the government-orchestrated rescue of HBOS, were justified at the time. But damage limitation is no longer enough \u2013 not least since Lloyds' rescue of HBOS seems to be dragging it down, too. Now Royal Bank of Scotland seems under threat; Barclays may be next in line. Waiting for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2008/oct/07/banking.technology\">the next bank to collapse</a> and then picking up the pieces will not restore confidence or get credit flowing around the economy again. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/07/banking.savings\">Across Europe</a>, governments are rushing to following Ireland's lead and guarantee (nearly) all deposits in the banking system. Here, the Treasury has just raised the guarantee on savers' deposits to \u00a350,000. But while it may soon be forced to extend a broader guarantee, this will not tackle the root causes of the crisis: a lack of capital in the financial system and sheer panic.</p> <p>A cut in interest rates <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/07/creditcrunch.marketturmoil\">would do some good</a>. Although inflation is well above the target rate of 2%, the Bank of England should slash rates when it meets on Thursday. As the global economy tanks, oil prices are sinking, so inflation is set to fall. Collapsing demand means that the real threat now is deflation, not inflation. But a big cut in interest rates will not be enough. If banks are unwilling to lend, monetary policy alone is virtually useless \u2013 in Keynes' words, it is like \"pushing on a string\". Bolder measures are needed.</p> <p>The US has opted for a $700bn bailout. In theory, taking bad debts off banks' books should reassure markets that that they are not about to go bust. Banks may be willing to lend to each other again, their share prices may recover somewhat, and investors \u2013 not least Asian governments and those of oil-rich states \u2013 may be willing to pump some of their huge cash reserves into them. But the bailout route is deeply flawed. It provides the most help to the banks that made the biggest mistakes. It exposes taxpayers to huge potential losses. And it does little to recapitalise the banking sector and thus encourage it to start lending again.</p> <p>There is a better way. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/07/banking.economy1\">now seems likely to happen</a> in some form, with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/07/creditcrunch\">chancellor's statement on Wednesday morning</a>, the government should buy stakes in \u2013 and in some cases, take over \u2013 stricken banks, an approach that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/07/sweden.banking.regulation\">worked well in Sweden</a> in the early 1990s. With the government standing behind banks, the fear that they are about to go bust would vanish. An injection of taxpayers' money would strengthen banks' balance sheets, allowing them to start lending again. But it would not be money for nothing: the government could acquire preference shares, which pay a hefty interest rate and put taxpayers first in line to be repaid if a bank fails. These could be combined with warrants (basically, options to buy shares at a future date at a specified price), so as to give us all a share in the profits when banks \u2013 and the economy \u2013 recover. </p> <p>John Hussman, a US analyst and investor, <a href=\"http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc080929.htm\">has suggested</a> a novel variant of this idea. He proposes that the government provide capital in the form of a \"super-bond\". This would be subordinate to deposits, and so could be counted as capital. But if a bank went bust, taxpayers would be repaid before shareholders and senior bondholders, thus protecting the financial system, customers and taxpayers. The super-bond could pay a relatively high interest rate to give banks an incentive to shift to private financing when conditions improve, but interest payments could be deferred until banks were profitable so as not to drain their cash reserves now. </p> <p>A government recapitalisation of the banking sector \u2013 combined with much tougher financial regulation to limit future excesses \u2013 would be good politics, as well as sound economics. With Labour so far behind in the polls, its only chance of recovery depends on rescuing the economy from the worst crisis since the 1930s. Decisive action would marginalise the Conservatives, who are unconvincing advocates for state intervention in the financial system and are, in any case, powerless to act. And since even <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7ddd9e02-92fb-11dd-98b5-0000779fd18c.html\">David Cameron has been forced</a> to concede that government injections of capital may be needed, the government has political cover to act. </p> <p>Gordon Brown has shown that he can be bold when circumstances demand it. Now is such a time.</p>",
  "<p>Alarm over the health of leading US banks sent Wall Street shares plummeting for a fifth successive day despite a broad hint from the Federal Reserve of an imminent cut in interest rates.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped by 508 points to 9,447. There were signs of a fresh collapse in confidence in financial institutions as Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America each lost a fifth of their value.</p> <p>In a week, the blue-chip US index has fallen by 1,400 points, wiping 13% off share prices. The sell-off accelerated after the Fed's chairman, Ben Bernanke, warned of dark days ahead in the global financial crisis.</p> <p>\"Economic activity is likely to be subdued during the remainder of this year and into next year,\" said Bernanke, citing \"financial turmoil\" in a speech to a conference in Washington.</p> <p>Bernanke said the slowdown had eased the risk of price inflation and in a sentence widely interpreted as a suggestion of an interest rate cut, he added: \"The Federal Reserve will need to consider whether the current stance of policy remains appropriate.\"</p> <p>In a mood of extreme edginess on Wall Street trading floors, speculation circulated that US banks were struggling to raise money. A rumour did the rounds that a planned $9bn investment in Morgan Stanley by Japan's Mitsubishi was falling apart, sending the US firm's shares down 20% despite its insistence that the deal was on track. Bank of America took a hammering on suggestions that it was struggling to find subscribers for a $10bn fundraising deal. Its shares dived by 26% although there were indications after the market closed that the cash call had been oversubscribed.</p> <p>Merrill Lynch fell by 25% because it is being taken over by Bank of America in a share-for-share transaction that is rapidly declining in value. President Bush, who was visiting an office supply company in a suburb of Washington, acknowledged that times were \"tough\" but insisted the US would recover: \"We've been through tough times before\". He continued: \"I wish I could snap my fingers and make what happened stop. But that's not the way it works.\"</p> <p>The sell-off came in spite of an effort by the US central bank to thaw out the credit markets by using public money to purchase commercial paper - a type of short-term debt issued by companies to generate day-to-day funding.</p> <p>Faced with the worsening environment, analysts at Deutsche Bank forecast that the US economy will shrink by 2% in the final quarter and that unemployment could hit 7% next year, \"Financial conditions are deteriorating at an ever faster pace,\" said Deutsche's economists in a note to clients. \"The economy needs credit expansion and without it, activity could collapse.\"</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund raised its estimate of losses from the global financial crisis to the US banking system to about $1.4 trillion (\u00a3800bn), up 45% from the $945bn it estimated in April and reaffirmed just two months ago.</p> <p>The figures, released in its twice-yearly Global Financial Stability Review, gave fresh impetus to the push for a comprehensive and coordinated international response to the crisis, which the IMF said had become disorderly and more damaging than previously thought.</p> <p>It also estimated that the global banks needed to raise $675bn in new capital in the next few years. The IMF's managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said the report \"shows how serious a crisis we currently face\". \"The time for piecemeal solutions is over. I therefore call on policymakers to urgently address the crisis at a national level with comprehensive measures to restore confidence in the financial sector. At the same time, national governments must closely coordinate these efforts to bring about a return to stability in the international financial system.\"</p> <p>The global financial crisis has its roots in the US mortgage industry, where the sheer scale of liabilities on unsustainable subprime loans is gradually becoming clear.

  "<p>Chancellor Alistair Darling is preparing an announcement before the stockmarket opens tomorrow morning, giving details of a plan to ease the banking crisis following high-level talks at Downing Street this evening.</p> <p>The talks, which ended around 6.30pm, had been given added urgency after a day in which shares in the banks suffered another mauling, with HBOS plunging 41.5% to close at 94p a share and Royal Bank of Scotland falling 39% to close at 90p.</p> <p>The chancellor met the prime minister, the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, and the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Adair Turner, at 5pm. </p> <p>In a brief statement after the close of the meeting, Darling said he had been working with other officials \"to put the banks on a longer term sound footing\".</p> <p>He also intends to address parliament tomorrow afternoon.</p> <p>Among other banks, Barclays closed more than 9% lower and Lloyds TSB shares were down nearly 13%, as the lack of a coordinated rescue plan for the sector alarmed the City. The FTSE 100 closed slightly higher, ending the session up 16 points at 4605.2.</p> <p>Last night, Britain's bank bosses had met with Darling to discuss a possible \u00a350bn injection of equity, which is likely to form the centrepiece of the bail-out plan.</p> <p>The talks centre on the idea of a part-nationalisation of the banking system through the injection of capital into the banks via preference shares, which take precedence over ordinary shares during a liquidation but do not give the holders any voting rights.</p> <p>John Varley, the chief executive of Barclays, insisted this morning that he had not sought any capital from the government. RBS later issued its own denial, telling the London stockmarket that \"contrary to press speculation, RBS did not make a request to government for capital\". </p> <p>HBOS has also denied it has asked for fresh funds while Lloyds TSB declined to comment.</p> <p>But it is clear that the bank executives are anxious for the government to press on with any plan to recapitalise the sector and attempt to restore confidence in the high-street banks.</p> <p>Darling disappointed investors when he did not make an announcement during his appearance in parliament yesterday and analysts have warned that the continued uncertainty is undermining the sector.</p> <p>\"Alistair Darling keeps saying that he won't take a rushed decision. But we need to see decisive action,\" said Manus Cranny of MF Global Spreads. \"We are at a crisis moment.\"</p> <p>The CBI piled the pressure on the government to provide a \"circuit-breaker\" to bring relief to the banking sector.</p> <p>\"There are three separate but related problems: a continued lack of liquidity in money markets, the erosion of bank capital resulting from the devaluation of their assets and the loss of confidence among depositors that their money is safe,\" said CBI deputy director-general, John Cridland.</p> <p>And veteran City commentator, David Buik from Cantor Index, said the markets were \"running scared\" after last night's talks were reported.</p> <p>He blamed the government for its handling of the crisis talks. \"I've never seen more disgraceful financial management,\" he said. \"All we've got now is speculation and fear. The market has collapsed.\"</p> <p>Darling has been working on a rescue plan behind the scenes, but in public has been reluctant to discuss his proposals in detail for fear of unsettling the markets. In a statement to the Commons on Monday, he said: \"It is right that we look at every aspect \u2013 liquidity, capital and regulation \u2013 with other countries and of course with the financial sector itself, but it would be irresponsible to speculate on the specifics of future responses.\"</p> <p>Following his meeting with bank chiefs last night, the chancellor was due to have another meeting with them this afternoon ahead of his meeting with the prime minister.</p> <p>Downing Street said that the meeting this afternoon involving Brown had been in the diary for some time. But it was not mentioned when parliamentary lobby journalists were briefed this morning about the prime minister's day.</p> <p>In a further sign of the turmoil sweeping the world's financial markets, the Icelandic government seized control of Landsbanki, the second largest bank in the country, as it sought to avert a financial meltdown. The Russian government also pumped $36bn into its banking sector.</p> <p><strong>Asian recovery</strong></p> <p>There was a late recovery in Asia thanks to a shock interest rate cut in Australia. Heavy selling pushed Japan's Nikkei index down by 5% to its lowest point since December 2003, before it later recovered to close 2.2% lower at 10155.9 points</p> <p>The federal bank of Australia astounded the markets by cutting interest rates by a full percentage point overnight, to 6%. Australia's central bank said it was relaxing its monetary policy in an effort to stop economic growth deteriorating as the mayhem in the financial markets continues. The move raised hopes of combined action by the world's central banks to try to stimulate the global economy.</p> <p>\"But if that is what the market is hanging its hat on, then it could be sorely disappointed,\" said Cranny.</p> <p>The Bank of England will set UK interest rates on Thursday and business groups are already demanding a half-point cut to 4.5%.</p> <p>European finance ministers met in Luxembourg today to discuss the crisis. Europe's failure to agree a coordinated rescue package for its banks was a major factor behind yesterday's sell-off, so there was pressure for progress - but the finance ministers disappointed by agreeing to lift bank deposit insurance to just \u20ac50,000, half of what some were looking for.</p> <p>\"Until such time as the banking sector is not totally reliant on central bank intervention and until trust is restored among the banks, there can be no measurable improvement in equity prices,\" warned Buik.</p>",

  "<p>The Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke gave a strong hint of an imminent cut in US interest rates as he painted a pessimistic picture of dark economic days ahead in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">worsening global financial crisis</a>.</p> <p>In remarks which aggravated another sharp decline in Wall Street share prices, Bernanke said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economic activity was likely to remain \"subdued\" into next year</a>.</p> <p>\"The intensification of financial turmoil and the further impairment of the functioning of credit markets seem likely to increase the restraint on economic activity in the period ahead,\" the Fed chairman told a conference of economists in Washington.</p> <p>He said slowing activity had improved the outlook for inflation, previously viewed as a risk if interest rates go too low. In a sentence widely interpreted as a suggestion of a rate cut, Bernanke added: \"The Federal Reserve will need to consider whether the current stance of policy remains appropriate.\"</p> <p>On a fifth consecutive day of weakness, the battered US financial markets fell sharply. Shortly after Bernanke had concluded his remarks, the Dow Jones industrial average was down by 325 points to 9,269. </p> <p>Banks, once again, took a hammering on both sides of the Atlantic. The investment bank Morgan Stanley saw its shares plummet 35% by early afternoon in New York. Merrill Lynch was down by 23% and Goldman Sachs slipped 7%.</p> <p>The sell-off came in spite of an effort by the US central bank to thaw out the credit markets by using public money to purchase commercial paper - a type of short-term debt issued by companies to generate day-to-day funding.</p> <p>Buying corporate debt is highly unusual for the central bank which usually only provides funds in return for cast-iron security. It is intended to provide a \"backstop\" for US companies which are struggling to raise money.</p> <p>In a statement, the Fed said the market for commercial paper had been under \"considerable strain\" as money market funds shy away from investing. It said this was impeding financial institutions' \"vital role in meeting the credit needs of businesses and households\".</p> <p>Faced with the worsening environment, analysts at Deutsche Bank forecast that the US economy will shrink by 2% in the final quarter and that unemployment could hit 7% next year,</p> <p>\"Financial conditions are deteriorating at an ever faster pace,\" said Deutsche's economists in a note to clients. \"The economy needs credit expansion and without it, activity could collapse.\"</p> <p>The global financial crisis has its roots in the US mortgage industry, where the sheer scale of liabilities on unsustainable sub-prime loans is gradually becoming clear. </p> <p>Figures published today by the Mortgage Bankers Association revealed that US lenders lost an average of $560 on every mortgage written last year. The shortfall compared unfavourably to a $50 loss in 2006 and a $258 profit in 2005.</p> <p>As more financial institutions run into trouble, the federal body guaranteeing Americans' savings has told banks to double the amount they pay in insurance premiums. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced that it wanted banks to pay 13.5% of their deposits into a guarantee fund, an increase from 6.3%.</p> <p>\"The US banking industry has the willingness and capacity to provide the necessary backing to the insurance fund,\" said the FDIC's chairman, Sheila Bair. \"The public can be sure that we will always have enough money to protect their insured deposits.\"</p>",
  "<p>With election day less than a month away, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> face off in the second of three presidential debates tonight, with voters watching to see which has a better grip on the steadily worsening global economic situation.</p> <p>The debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, comes a day after global stock markets faltered, despite the US congress's vote last week to inject $700bn into US credit markets, setting the stage for a conversation tonight over how best to right the economy.</p> <p>As bad economic news has continued to dominate the presidential race, Obama has soared in the polls. Voters say they trust the Democrat more than McCain to handle the financial mess, and tie the Republican candidate to the unpopular Bush administration. </p> <p>Tonight the onus falls on McCain to, at the very least, halt Obama's momentum, regain energy and reignite enthusiasm behind his campaign, which last week announced it was pulling out of the key swing state of Michigan and has lost ground in polling in many other swing states.</p> <p>The forum's loosely structured town hall format, in which the candidates will take questions from members of the audience and viewers sending questions online, could favour McCain, who thrives in more relaxed settings. </p> <p>But Obama, a former law professor at the University of Chicago, is himself a skilled debater, and honed his craft over 16 months of encounters with Hillary Clinton and other candidates during the Democratic primary season. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the husband of McCain running mate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> will answer questions in an abuse-of-power inquiry in Alaska, CNN reported. </p> <p>A state legislative committee subpoenaed him and several aides to Palin, the governor of Alaska, in its investigation into whether Palin fired the state's public safety commissioner to settle a personal score. </p> <p>The commissioner, Walt Monegan, had refused to sack a state trooper who was embroiled in a messy child custody dispute with Palin's sister. Palin dismissed him in July, stating publicly that the two had a disagreement on budget issues. The legislature's report on the matter is due on Friday.</p> <p>The last presidential debate was largely seen as a draw, with some commentators giving Obama a slight edge. The debate will be moderated by Tom Brokaw of NBC News.</p> <p>Polls have shown the economy is the foremost issue on voters' minds, and the crumbling stock markets, worsening employment and still-frozen credit markets have combined to make it the most salient issue of the race. </p> <p>Over the weekend, McCain aides said they would try to move the conversation away from economic issues and onto questions of character. </p> <p>Since then, Palin has questioned Obama's association with a 1960's-era radical, who participated in bombings but now is renowned in Chicago as an education policy expert. She also brought up his attendance at the church of Reverend Jeremiah Wright, a fiery, divisive preacher who provided fodder for Clinton's campaign. </p> <p>But the timing of the McCain camp's efforts, coming as Obama's poll numbers are gaining and the economy is flagging, may cause voters to consider them a distraction.</p> <p>In response, the Obama campaign unveiled a website and documentary-style video highlighting McCain's ties to Charles Keating, a banking executive who went to prison in connection with the savings and loan scandals of the 1980s. </p> <p>A Senate committee in 1991 exonerated McCain in the matter, but faulted his \"poor judgment\" in his dealings with Keating. The Obama campaign says the episode illustrates a lapse in judgment on matters of financial oversight.</p> <p>In a memo released this morning, Obama spokesman Bill Burton sought to downplay expectations of the Democrat's performance tonight, noting, \"When it comes to sheer format, we enter today's debate the decided underdog\". That is a common campaign tactic in the run up to debates. Burton also predicted McCain would sling mud at Obama rather than engage him on economic issues.</p> <p>\"In order to change the dynamics of this race, we anticipate that McCain will launch his nastiest attacks and continue to lie about Barack Obama's record and his vision to fundamentally change our country,\" he said. He continued: \"The American people aren't interested in nasty, false attacks, and they're not interested in four more years of Bush policies. But that's all he's offering.\"</p> <p>Tonight's questions are likely to focus on economic issues. Yesterday, the Dow Jones closed below 10,000 points for the first time since 2004, finishing several hundred points lower than the day George Bush took office in January 2001. </p> <p>That provides ammunition for Obama to press his case that the country is worse off after eight years of Republican control of the White House, and that McCain would only continue Bush's failed policies of tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.</p> <p>To the extent that McCain is forced to confront the economy tonight, he is likely to continue to press his case that an Obama administration would raise taxes, hindering job growth and economic recovery.</p> <p>Meanwhile, new rounds of polling continue to show voters moving steadily into Obama's camp. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released this morning has Obama ahead in the key swing state of Ohio, 51 percent to 45 percent. An aggregate of national polling maintained by pollster.com shows Obama up 49.9% to 42.9%.</p>",
  "<p>It was, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanfreedland\">Jonathan Freedland</a> noted, impeccable timing. \"Just as global capitalism is collapsing all around us and as the free market ideology is in tatters, we ask, 'Is the future Conservative?'\"</p> <p>The dilemma confronting the four panellists at <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/spoken-word/words-on-monday Kings Place\">last night's Comment is Free and Soundings debate</a> was the same one David Cameron faced in his <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2008/10/David_Cameron_Conference_Speech_2008.aspx\">conference speech</a> last week and their response to it owed much to his. Today's conservatism is not to be confused with libertarianism. For one thing, <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/blog/ourkingdom-theme/tom-griffin/2008/10/01/cameron-reclaims-society\">Conservatives definitely believe in society</a>.</p> <p>Prospective Tory candidate Jesse Norman set the tone, calling for \"a new political economy\" to replace \"the standard uber-libertarian model\". \"It is a debate actually that only the right is in a position to have,\" he argued, \"because only the right has moved beyond the state versus individual argument.\"</p> <p>Few on the right can have moved further beyond that dichotomy than theologian <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/blog/ourkingdom/2008/09/19/red-tory\">Phillip Blond</a>, who claimed that \"civil society has been crushed. It has been crushed by the state from the left and it has been crushed by the market from the right.\"</p> <p>Blond praised Cameron for initiating a \"Conservative communitarian recovery of the social\" but acknowledged that \"the economic thinking out of that has yet to take place\".</p> <p>Civitas analyst Anastasia de Waal injected a note of scepticism, questioning how compassionate Conservatism could be squared with traditional Tory priorities: \"There's a lot of talk about a small state being very important. There's a lot of talk about low taxes being very important, but there's also a lot of talk about the things the left minds about. It's difficult to see how those are going to be reconcilable with what we imagine will actually be the bottom line.\"</p> <p>Ferdinand Mount, the former head of Margaret Thatcher's policy unit, highlighted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/29/toryconference.economy\">George Osborne's planned council tax freeze</a> as one instance where Thatcherite centralism had won out over the new values of localism and \"intermediate institutions\". \"Speaking as somebody who had a tiny bit of responsibility for castrating local government 20 years ago, I'm very sorry to see them falling down that path,\" he said.</p> <p>Pressed on the extent to which the <a href=\"http://www.lwbooks.co.uk/conservative.pdf\">new thinking</a> (pdf) is an implicit repudiation of Thatcherism, Mount acknowledged that in the 1980s \"the concentration on economic regeneration was overdone with certain malign consequences\".</p> <p>That perhaps was the emerging Tory consensus of a few months ago. Thatcher had fixed a broken economy. Cameron's job would be to fix a broken society.</p> <p>In recent weeks, as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> has challenged the first part of that equation, the second part has been pressed into service to fill the void. As Labour MP Jon Cruddas noted, the Conservatives do not yet have an alternative political economy. Until a few weeks ago many Tories never imagined they might need such a thing. </p> <p>The new emphasis on civil society emerged against the backdrop of a neoliberal economic consensus. Somewhat fortuitously, it has given the Tories a way out of the shipwreck of market individualism, even if the escape took some of last night's panellists into the kind of exotic waters that might be more familiar to the Co-operative party than the Conservative party.</p> <p>It remains to be seen how much substance lies behind this rapidly repurposed rhetoric. As Norman put it, \"fixing the broke society is different from fixing the broken society\". The Tories are still coming to terms with the idea that the former task might be their real one.</p>",
  "<p>Plans for a new generation of heavily polluting coal-fired power stations were dealt a blow today in Europe when MEPs voted for tough regulations which would force energy companies to fit expensive equipment to trap the emissions.</p> <p>The carbon dioxide emissions limit set by the European Parliament environment committee is the same as that set by California - 500 grams of CO2 per kilowatt/hour. Anti-coal campaigners in the US claim this has effectively outlawed coal power being sold to the state.</p> <p>However the committee also voted for a \u20ac10bn (\u00a37.8bn) fund to pay for trials of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which could trap most emissions. This could enable some coal stations to be built, using the EU funds to pay for the massive expected costs of CCS.</p> <p>The amendments to the draft Directive on Geological Storage of<br>Carbon Dioxide still have to pass at least two further levels. One is the powerful European council of environment ministers, where there is likely to be strong lobbying by some states, including coal-rich Poland. But environment campaigners hailed the decision as a \"huge development\".</p> <p>Development charity Oxfam said the new emissions performance standard, which would apply to all power stations from 2015, would \"rule out\" plans for the first new coal plant for a generation in the UK, proposed by E.ON at Kingsnorth in Kent. </p> <p>Although the UK government is expected to announce a small CCS trial next year, possibly at Kingsnorth, even supporters of CCS admit it would not be available at commercial scale until 2020 at least, and some experts claim it will be much later. </p> <p>Greenpeace executive director, John Sauven, said: \"Emissions performance standards have already worked to stop new coal-fired power stations in California, and it's a welcome development that Europe is adopting a similar principle here. If this European proposal becomes law, E.ON's plans for a new plant at Kingsnorth would not be able to go ahead in their current form.\"</p> <p>Delia Villagrasa of wildlife charity WWF said the ruling would impact 50 new coal-fired plants planned across Europe, including up to eight in the UK. \"The emissions limit is a crucial step to avoid a return to dirty coal in the EU, to combat climate change effectively and to support clean power,\" she added.</p> <p>However Caroline Lucas, the Green MEP and leader of the UK Green Party, warned that any power station built before 2015 could escape the tougher regulations - including potentially Kingsnorth if it was given the go ahead in the next few months. \"The implications for Kingsnorth, and the other coal fired power stations the government is planning, is that, as long as they're built before 2015, they can go ahead without CCS - bringing with them devastating consequences for the climate,\" said Lucas. </p> <p>Other environment campaigners said the committee - which only failed to pass a 400g limit by one vote - was likely to initiate increasingly tough emissions standards which would make investors nervous of building new coal generators.</p> <p>The MEPs vote came on the day that the UK government's independent Climate Change Committee recommended a target to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">cut greenhouse gas emissions by \"at least 80%\" by 2050</a>, including for the first time aviation and international shipping.</p> <p>If the recommendation is accepted in full by the new energy and climate department, it would also effectively bar new coal-fired power stations in the UK without full carbon capture and storage (CCS) equipment.</p> <p>Despite strong lobbying against it, the European Parliament environment committee also voted nearly unanimously in favour of a controversial increase in the 2020 EU emissions reduction target from 20% to 30% if there is international agreement, and for longer term reductions of 60-80% by 2050.</p> <p>Lucas said: \"While the Greens regret that the legislation has not been based on a 30% reduction from the outset, we are glad that attempts to undermine the automatic increase of the target were not successful.\"</p> <p>\"In addition, MEPs voted in favour of setting out long term emissions reductions targets - 50% by 2035 and 60-80% by 2050. This is crucial for the credibility of the EU in playing a lead role in the negotiation of a meaningful international climate deal.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>THE OLD GREY WHINGE AND GRISTLE FEST</strong></p> <p>When the president of Fifa appeared before the EU yesterday to plead for more stringent regulations governing who is permitted to buy football clubs with their own or other people's money, the Fiver felt even grimier than usual. The sweats, the anxiety, the sensation of insects crawling up our skin could mean only one thing: for the first time in living memory, we were in agreement with Sepp Blatter. </p> <p>Eugh! </p> <p>Of course the problem with Sepp is that, even when he's talking what appears to be sense, he is invariably undone by his blatant hypocrisy. Which means that when this power-crazed gravy-train merchant with little or no interest in football warns a room-full of like-minded gravy-train merchants with little or no interest in football that \"we must ask ourselves what motivates [football club] owners and are they really interested in the game or just making money,\" the eyes of most sane folk roll straight towards heaven. </p> <p>Today, the culture secretary Andy Burnham clambered aboard the Blatter bandwagon, calling for a more efficient test for wannabe owners that isn't so completely useless that wannabe owners can become owners without actually passing it. A fit-and-proper fit-and-proper-persons test, as it were. \"It should be applied before they take over the club, not after the event as it is at the moment. Then at least we can have more confidence in the people coming in to own English football clubs,\" said Burnham, who was doing really well until he demonstrated his naivety by demanding a \"strong and reformed FA\".</p> <p>And just when you thought this story about pallid, expensive grey suit-on-suit action in the global corridors of power couldn't get any more exciting, the FA chairman Lord Tiresome stuck his neb in. \"The best estimate I could get in the City yesterday was that debts in English football as a whole have probably edged to the \u00a33bn mark,\" he droned, before adding that he's still waiting to hear back from a loft conversion specialist in Acton and a plumber in Leytonstone.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I was not happy about it\" - is Sepp Blatter down in the mouth about (a) Uefa expanding the European Nations Cup from 16 teams to 374, (b) his foie gras intravenous drip being removed, or (c) the total lack of Sarah Palin lookalikes dancing in front of him wearing only suspenders?</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>IT'S THE CUP THEY'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT (THEY BEING UEFA MARKETING EXECUTIVES, AS EVERYONE ELSE IS PAST CARING)</strong></p> <p>Back in May at Wembley, Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp lifted the FA Cup above his beaming face - which is slipping slowly to the floor, see, like Paul McCartney's - and thought \"finally my work is done, look, I've won something at last, so balls to it, I'll spend the rest of the year phoning it i ... hold on\" ... and thought \"what a beano it will be carousing round Europe for a tournament which used to be arguably harder to win than the old Big Cup but has now been shafted beyond all recognition by some Uefa marketing executive who should be kicked and kicked and hoofed and kicked in the face until every last purse-lipped feature shears off the front of his sorry sku ... hold on\" ... and thought \"I wonder if, in next season's Euro Vase, I'll get to face another chancer who is running down their career like me earning lots of money for old rope?\" Yes, we had it pretty much nailed the first time.</p> <p>So imagine how appy 'Appy Arry will be to learn that, in Stage Fun of Euro Vase, his Portsmouth side will fail to score against Milan, the eponymous heroes from the city Ronaldinho is spending his retirement in.

  "<p>The world's largest insurance company, AIG, spent $440,000 (\u00a3250,000) on a lavish corporate retreat at one of California's top beachside resorts just a week after accepting a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/aig.insurance.wallstreet\">n $85bn emergency loan from the US government to stave off bankruptcy</a>.</p> <p>Details of the getaway emerged at a congressional hearing today where lawmakers expressed outrage at AIG executives \"wining and dining\" at the height of a financial crisis.</p> <p>An invoice from <a href=\"http://www.stregismb.com/\">the St Regis resort in Monarch Beach</a>, south of Los Angeles, shows that AIG spent $139,375 on rooms, $147,301 on \"banquets\", $23,380 on spa treatments and $6,939 on golf at an eight-day company event which began on September 22.</p> <p>A week earlier, on September 17, the Federal Reserve had to extend a huge credit line to AIG to keep the troubled firm from collapsing due to vast liabilities on risky financial insurance policies.</p> <p>\"Average Americans are suffering economically,\" said Henry Waxman, chairman of the House oversight committee. \"They are losing their jobs, their homes and their health insurance. Yet less than one week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation.\"</p> <p>Set in 172 acres of grounds on a bluff overlooking the Pacific ocean, the St Regis resort describes itself as \"Tuscan inspired\". Rates for its 325 rooms are typically upwards of $500 a night and the travel guide Fodor's gives the place a rave review, saying: \"Exclusivity and indulgence carry the day here; you can even have someone unpack for you.\"</p> <p>An AIG spokesman said the event was to entertain independent insurance salesmen of AIG American General - one of the company's main US operations which offers life, health and accident policies.</p> <p>\"It was a recognition event for independent agents of AIG American General who distribute insurance policies,\" said the spokesman. \"It was planned months ago.\"</p> <p>In written evidence to Congress, AIG's former chief executive, Robert Willumstad, blamed an \"unexpected and unprecedented market-wide crisis of confidence\" for the company's financial predicament.</p> <p>AIG wrote off more than $50bn in unrealised losses on complex mortgage-related instruments such as credit default swaps. But Willumstad, who stood down as a condition of the federal bail-out, blamed mark-to-market accounting rules for accentuating the impact of the company's exposure, prompting downgrades by credit rating agencies.</p> <p>\"Looking back at my time as CEO, I don't believe AIG could have done anything differently,\" said Willumstad. \"The market seizure was an unprecedented global catastrophe.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"World takes fright,\" splashes the Times today under a large gloomy image of the FTSE's closing performance: -391.06. So how thoughtful of those good men and women at the paper to offer today's readers a free CD of Joy Division's Closer, one of the most downbeat and miserably introspective albums in rock history (and released two months after the suicide of the band's vocalist Ian Curtis). Staff at the Thunderer may appreciate the sentiment, as rumours of job cuts at News International rumble on and the global economy melts down. And the sorrow doesn't end there.

  "<p>The world's leading diarrhoea experts will meet in Edinburgh tomorrow to discuss the disease that kills more children globally than Aids, tuberculosis and malaria combined.</p> <p>Around 1.8 million people are killed annually by diarrhoeal disease, with 80% of deaths from the disease occurring in the first two years of life.</p> <p>The meeting between US and UK academics, organised by the science directorate of the British Consulate General in San Francisco, is aimed at improving control and treatment of diarrhoeal diseases.</p> <p>Researchers from the Gates Foundation, Institute for OneWorld Health and leading US universities will visit the University of Edinburgh after meetings with government agencies and academics in London.</p> <p>They hope to form new research partnerships that will develop treatments for diarrhoeal diseases and to understand factors that affect the delivery of treatments in developing countries.</p> <p>Prof Tony Nash, director of Edinburgh's centre for infectious diseases, said: \"Despite progress, under-five mortality is not declining fast enough, and as diarrhoeal disease accounts for 17% of deaths under five, it is a crucial area of international health research.</p> <p>\"Some people in public health groupings feel there's a lot of information there already and now we need to deliver that with the help of government backing and finance but at the same time you still need blue-skies research to move this forward.</p> <p>\"We're still treating diarrhoeal diseases with antibiotics which leads to antibiotic resistance and even more damaging bacteria. We want to look at ways of disarming bacteria without causing this kind of change.</p> <p>\"We want to see if there's any kind of common ground to take things forward and I'm hoping it will lead to some funding to initiate research projects.\"</p> <p>US expert, Prof David Sack of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who is former executive director of the International Centre of Diarrhoeal Disease in Bangladesh, said: \"I am very pleased to be part of this delegation and look forward to sharing ideas with UK experts.</p> <p>\"I have spent many years in Bangladesh directing research for the treatment of diarrhoeal diseases and see improving treatment in this area as a major challenge in improving global health.\"</p> <p>The conference takes place one week after a major meeting at the United Nations in New York, which discussed health and education, poverty and hunger, and environmental sustainability.</p> <p>The meeting, hosted by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, resulted in a plan for delivery of the millennium development goals, including improving health systems.</p>",
  "<p>Saturday in the gilded Salle des F\u00eates of the Elys\u00e9e palace in Paris and we, a few hundred journalists and scores of top officials, witness the flight of the EU's seven leading figures from reality. </p> <p>Outside, on a chilly but sunny evening, the creeping Balkanisation of Europe's integrated banking system is moving up a gear; inside, they're talking up a coordinated, collective response to combat the risk of a 1930s-style depression.</p> <p>But they \u2013 Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel, Gordon Brown, Silvio Berlusconi, Jean-Claude Trichet of the ECB, Jean-Claude Juncker of the eurogroup and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso of the EC \u2013 know full well that the EU's financial system is going down the Seine and they're preparing emergency 'national measures'.</p> <p>But it's close to 8pm in continental Europe and the main and only TV news programme of the day beckons. At all costs, these leaders have to demonstrate to tens of millions of viewers that their leaders are in full command, their savings and deposits are safe and the EU is at one in confronting the crisis. As with climate change, it can help save the world.</p> <p>Seven leaders, seven individual statements, seven individual questions and then the show's over. Berlusconi, smoothing down his new waxed hairpiece, talks straight to the TV channels he owns and, after a brief word in Sarko's ear, talks incessantly.</p> <p>Brown, exhausted, adjusts his earpiece and scowls. Sarko and Merkel, the German chancellor who has recoiled at his physical embraces in the past, lean closer and smile tenderly into each other's face, their noses almost touching. Trichet hears a low chant of \"Basta! Basta!\" from non-Italian journos and laughs. </p> <p>Sarko, the host, goes into verbal overdrive. Soon, it's over. \"So, what's the news?\" we ask each other. \"There isn't any.\"</p> <p>A veteran Spanish colleague tells me: \"It's a disgrace. The Spanish banks are taking over yours - they're solid. Zapatero isn't invited but Berlusconi and basket-case Italy are.\" </p> <p>\"I'm ashamed every time he [Berlusconi] opens his mouth,\" another old Italian acquaintance says.</p> <p>\"So, what are you Brits going to do, <em>verdammt noch'mal</em>? It's your system, yours and the Americans', that spread this poison,\" a German friend glowers.</p> <p>It's all very collegial joking and back-patting as we head over the road to the ornate Marigny hotel - where Gadafy parked his tent in the garden - and the Elys\u00e9es <em>traiteurs</em> have prepared a spread.</p> <p>Sunday morning and the mutual recriminations are out in the open. It's every man for himself, or <em>sauve qui peut</em>, as those national crises publicly erupt, demanding beggar-thy-neighbour solutions for local electorates demanding rock-bottom guarantees for their savings \u2013 or there'll be runs on the banks all over Europe.</p> <p>It's easy, of course, to mock the punctured ambitions of the EU and its leaders, not least their 'failure' to agree on a Paulson-style bail-out plan or a pan-European regulator to police the 44 cross-border banks that control 70% of the \u20ac32tn of assets in the EU banking sector. (The man/woman on the Brussels tram has never heard of the 'Lamfalussy level three' committee of European banking supervisors which meets occasionally in London and has never voted once.)</p> <p>As Trichet said last week, the EU is, unlike the US, not a federal state. There is no political union. Eurosceptics slavering with schadenfreude cannot have it both ways: deride federalism in good times and demand it when the bad times roll. The EU is in disarray but so is everybody else. When this crisis is over, Europeans may be forced to club together more closely than they have so far.</p> <h2>Bitter pill for Belgium</h2> <p>OK, so not much chance of that right now. Take Benelux, where the once cuddly, now ruthless, Dutch have forced the dismantlement of Fortis, Belgium's biggest bancassurer, and this week's takeover, via temporary nationalisation, by BNP Paribas. (The Dutch have nationalised its Dutch operations.) </p> <p>Dismissing Belgium as a banking dwarf when, at the end of last year, Fortis ranked 19th in Europe and was worth \u20ac40bn, De Telegraaf, a Dutch newspaper, gloated this week: \"After selling its steel and energy groups in the 1980s and 1990s, the Belgians' sole remaining global role is in making beer.\"</p> <p>Sounds like we're back to post-Napoleonic Europe and the Congress of Vienna \u2013 just before Belgium revolted against Dutch control and, after a nationalist opera at La Monnaie, provoked a riot and won its independence in 1830. For a country constantly on the edge of break-up and yet still the EU capital, it's a poison pill to swallow.</p> <p>Baudouin Prot, chief executive of BNP, which has acquired Fortis's \u20ac239bn of customers' deposits to leapfrog the league table and become the eurozone's biggest retail bank for a knock-down price, didn't mince his words on Monday. Reassuring Belgian clients their accounts are safe in one of the world's top three banks by credit rating, he said: \"There was no alternative.\"</p> <p>But it didn't help that, as an international banker, he peppered his emollient phrases with English: \"C'est le proof of the pudding in the eating\" and the like, adding: \"I don't know how to say that in Belgian.\" They, of course, speak French, Dutch and German in this trilingual state.</p> <p>Anyway, if recapitalisation of Europe's banks means renationalisation so far, Prot held out the dim prospect of a counter-tendency: the ever-greater concentration of the sector in the hands of a few mega-banks. </p> <p>When I asked him whether BNP had the means to take over other banks in difficulty, he said: \"In France, we say you should not have eyes bigger than your stomach \u2026 BNP, for the moment, will be pre-occupied with integrating Fortis but that does not mean we will not do anything else.\"</p> <p>France, we know, always wanted a united Europe \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise. The Germans who, 15 years ago wanted a European Germany, are now toying with the idea of a German Europe. The two could be about to fight out this battle of ideas in the EU banking sector.</p>",

They are due to meet again at the Treasury this afternoon.</p> <p>The talks centre on the idea of a part-nationalisation of the banking system through the injection of capital into the banks via preference shares, which take precedence over ordinary shares during a liquidation, but do not give the holders any voting rights.</p> <p>John Varley, the chief executive of Barclays, insisted this morning that he had not sought any capital from the government. RBS later issued its own denial, telling the London stockmarket that \"contrary to press speculation, RBS did not make a request to government for capital.\" HBOS has also denied it is asking for fresh funds while Lloyds TSB declined to comment.</p> <p>But it is clear that the bank executives are anxious for the government to press on with any plan to recapitalise the sector and attempt to restore confidence in the high street banks. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/07/economy.alistairdarling\">Darling disappointed investors when he did not make an announcement</a> during his appearance in parliament yesterday, and analysts have warned that the continued uncertainty is undermining the sector.</p> <p>\"Alistair Darling keeps saying that he won't take a rushed decision. But we need to see decisive action,\" said Manus Cranny of MF Global Spreads. \"We are at a crisis moment.\"</p> <p>The CBI piled the pressure on the government to provide a \"circuit-breaker\" to bring relief to the troubled banking sector.</p> <p>\"There are three separate but related problems: a continued lack of liquidity in money markets, the erosion of bank capital resulting from the devaluation of their assets, and the loss of confidence among depositors that their money is safe,\" said CBI deputy director-general John Cridland.</p> <p>And veteran City commentator David Buik said the markets were \"running scared\" after last night's talks were reported.</p> <p>He blamed the government for its handling of the crisis talks. \"I've never seen more disgraceful financial management,\" he said. \"All we've got now is speculation and fear.

Heavy selling pushed Japan's Nikkei index down by 5% to its lowest point since December 2003, before it later recovered somewhat to close 2.2% lower at 10155.9 points</p> <p>The Federal Bank of Australia astounded the markets by cutting interest rates by a full percentage point overnight, to 6%. Australia's central bank said it was relaxing its monetary policy in an effort to stop economic growth deteriorating as the mayhem in the financial markets continues. The move raised hopes of combined action by the world's central banks to try to stimulate the global economy.</p> <p>\"But if that is what the market is hanging its hat on, then it could be sorely disappointed,\" cautioned Cranny.</p> <p>The Bank of England will set UK interest rates on Thursday, and business groups are already demanding a half-point cut to 4.5%.</p> <p>European finance ministers are meeting in Luxembourg today to discuss the crisis. Europe's failure to agree a coordinated rescue package for its banks was a major factor behind yesterday's sell-off, so there is pressure for progress.</p> <p>\"Until such time as the banking sector is not totally reliant on central bank intervention and until trust is restored among the banks, there can be no measurable improvement in equity prices,\" warned David Buik of Cantor Index.</p>",
  "<p>The Football Association chairman Lord Triesman today added English football to the list of industries facing mounting debts because of the global credit crisis. In a speech at the Leaders in Football conference, Triesman revealed the game was \u00a33bn in the red and needed forceful action to prevent the problem getting worse.</p> <p>\"The best estimate I could get in the City yesterday was that debts in English football as a whole have probably edged to the \u00a33,000m mark,\" said Triesman, before adding that in 2006-07 the Deloitte group identified more than \u00a3950m of debt in the top four clubs alone, with wages growing at 12% a year.</p> <p>He claimed that such \"toxic debt\" could cause massive damage to the game and called for a review of the fit and proper persons test in order to make football club ownership more transparent.</p> <p>\"Transparency lies in an unmarked grave,\" he said. \"Nobody has real confidence in what they cannot see.

He also expressed concern that the rise of foreign players in England was damaging the national side's chances.</p> <p>\"We need our senior men's team to do well and in Fabio Capello and the players I'm sure we have that capacity,\" he said. \"But that capacity has certain limits and we need to acknowledge that the number of eligible England players is declining too far too fast.</p> <p>\"England fans rightly demand more and they want it now or at least in very near future. England can't be like an aircraft carrier in which largely foreign fighters take off, however brilliant their engineering.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Triesman has also claimed that Tottenham Hotspur should ban for life the supporters who recently verbally abused Sol Campbell. \"I abhor the treatment of Sol Campbell by supporters of a club that I have loved and supported all my life,\" he said. \"I hope the individuals will be identified and, if appropriate, banned from Tottenham's ground.\"</p> <p>\"The supporters responsible have let their club down in a way that is totally unacceptable.

No, this is not some kind of post-modern theatre, but an ancient ritual that has taken place pretty much every night for the past 700 years. The Ceremony of the Keys involves a complex set of rituals to ensure that the Tower of London is locked up good and proper. At exactly 9.53pm each and every night the Chief Warder, in his regal red coat and somewhat bonkers Tudor bonnet, carrying the Queen's Key and a giant lantern, marches around the perimeter of the Tower of London locking up the gates, accompanied by Foot Guards, sentries and various other characters straight out of the history books. Complete with archaic greetings, a bugler and the best costumes you're ever likely to see. </p> <p>\u2022 The Ceremony of the Keys is free, but permission to accompany requires a written letter.

For \u00a38 you can buy a River Roamer (after 10am weekdays and anytime weekends), and get on and off the boats all day. There is no garbled commentary (that's so common on the leisure boats) and it runs from Millbank (Tate Britain) to O2 at Greenwich stopping at all the usual sights (Tower of London, London Eye, The Globe, Greenwich etc).</p> <p>All seats have good views and there is a bar serving snacks, coffee, soft drinks, wine and beer at reasonable prices. The boats get busy towards the end of the day, especially travelling east. You may have to wait for the next boat, or make your way home by bus or tube.

It dates back to medieval times, but the current version dates from 1676 when it was rebuilt after a fire. It's had Shakespeare and Dickens among its clientele over the years and therein lies the main attraction; it's one of those places where you can step back in time from the bustle of the city.</p> <p>The pub was originally built around three sides of the courtyard and must have looked pretty spectacular. Unfortunately two sides were knocked down in the late 1800s to make way for railway warehouses \u2013 another blow for progress.

The first \u20ac22,000 (roughly \u00a317,000) held in the accounts is secured under an Icelandic compensation scheme, and the remainder up to \u00a350,000 is guaranteed by the British government.</p> <p>On state radio, commerce and banking minister Bjorgvin Sigurdsson sought to reassure people in Iceland that the bank would remain open and continue to run as normal.</p> <p>The Landsbanki chairman and a large shareholder in the bank is Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, the owner of West Ham United football club.</p> <p>In an address broadcast on Icelandic television last night, prime minister Geir Haarde announced plans to rush through the emergency bill, supported by opposition parties, allowing the government to push through mergers between the battered banks or force them into bankruptcy.<br>\"We were faced with the real possibility that the national economy would be sucked into the global banking swell and end in national bankruptcy,\" he said.</p> <p>There was some confusion about whether the loan from Russia had been agreed. Iceland's central bank said in a statement that it had been informed by the Russian ambassador that Iceland would be given a \u20ac4bn loan and that it had been agreed by the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin. The bank said Haarde had approached the Russians about a loan some months ago.</p> <p>But the Russian state news agency separately quoted the deputy finance minister, Dmitry Pankin, as saying there had been no formal approach from Iceland and that no decision had been made. The Icelandic bank then updated its statement to say that negotiations would begin \"in the next few days\".</p> <p>The Icelandic Financial Services Authority said it had taken control of Landsbanki to \"guarantee a functioning domestic banking system\".</p> <p>The fate of Iceland, which has extensive interests in the UK, is seen as a warning for the rest of the world, after a long boom fuelled by debt, a dependence on its banking industry and a buoyant housing market.</p> <p>Time appeared to be running out for Iceland to deliver a solution to the financial crisis yesterday as its currency, the krona, slumped 30% against the euro, accelerating a decline that has been taking place over the past year.</p> <p>The emergency bill would also allow the government to take over housing loans held by the banks.</p> <p>The Icelandic government now has control of two of the biggest three banks in the country \u2014 the only one remaining in private hands is Kaupthing.</p> <p>Last week, Landsbanki sold the bulk of its international operations, including the London-based Landsbanki Securities, the former Teather &amp; Greenwood, to smaller rival Straumur-Burdaras, to try to bolster its capital base. But with the wholesale markets closing down, banks are finding it difficult to raise the short-term funding necessary for their day-to-day operations, especially when there is nervousness about an institution's stability.</p> <p>Kaupthing and Straumur-Burdaras said in a statement this morning that they continued to operate as normal and had no indication that the government intended to intervene.</p> <p>The financial regulator yesterday suspended shares in Iceland's main banks to prevent panic selling. The government also followed Ireland and Germany by guaranteeing all domestic deposits in Icelandic savings accounts.</p> <p>Concerns about the Icelandic economy grew stronger last week after the government seized control of the third-largest bank, Glitnir, taking a 75% stake in return for \u20ac600m (\u00a3466m). Haarde warned Icelanders at the time of \"the inevitable cut in living standards\" to come.</p> <p>The falling currency, which closed at a record low of 230 Icelandic krona to the euro, is worsening the crisis for the banks, which are shouldering large overseas debts, and for many thousands of individuals in Iceland who were encouraged to take out loans in foreign currencies.</p> <p>In Iceland, there is widespread fear. Sigridur Dogg Audunsdottir, a local government worker in Reykjavik said everyone in the country was \"holding their breath\". Yesterday, she withdrew cash from the bank all the way to her overdraft limit to make sure her family had enough to live on. \"It is just unimaginable. It is so dark and gloomy, we have never experienced anything like this. I took out my money just to be safe, because I felt I had to do something. We've all been living ahead of ourselves, so in many ways this was inevitable. People here have been so obsessed with money. Iceland is like a nouveau riche country.</p> <p>\"I am not blaming the people. The problem seems to be oversized banks in a small economy. We trusted the banks and they encouraged us to borrow money.\"</p> <p>A collapse in Iceland would severely dent confidence in the broader financial markets. But it could also affect Britain, with the main banks funding a string of companies and entrepreneurs, including Robert Tchenguiz, a large investor in Sainsbury's, chef Gordon Ramsay and property tycoons the Candy brothers.</p> <p>One of Iceland's biggest companies, Baugur, has stakes in a swath of the British high street, including House of Fraser, Karen Millen, Oasis and Whittard of Chelsea. One of the biggest credit insurance firms has stopped covering suppliers to Baugur-controlled stores. In a statement over the weekend, it reiterated that most of the funding of its businesses comes from international banks and that it has little exposure to the disaster-struck Icelandic economy.</p> <p>Haarde is said to have approached other Nordic governments to see if their central banks might be prepared to inject liquidity into the Icelandic system. Haarde said the banks had agreed at the weekend to sell some overseas assets and bring the cash back to Iceland.</p> <p>The country's pension funds, which have assets of \u20ac12bn, are also being encouraged to repatriate cash.<br>Kaupthing holds deposits for thousands of UK savers through its Kaupthing Edge account. Kaupthing Edge is covered by the UK government guarantee on deposits up to \u00a350,000. A spokeswoman for Kaupthing said there had been no rush to close accounts.</p> <p>Richard Portes, an expert on Iceland at the London Business School, said the government had made a mistake by nationalising Glitnir, creating fear in the markets instead of just providing it with liquidity.<br>\"You have the same law of unintended consequences that you had in the case of Lehman Brothers,\" he said. \"The Iceland problem was immediately vastly exaggerated.\"</p> <p>He said the Icelandic banks had been unfairly targeted. \"The world is a little unjust. They don't hold any toxic papers. The assets they will have to sell are perfectly good assets. They have been prudently managed and haven't been excessively dependent on the wholesale money markets compared to anyone else,\" he said.</p> <p>Iceland has undergone a remarkable transformation in the past couple of decades, from an economy largely based on fishing to one of the richest in Europe, driven by its biggest banks after deregulation of the banking system. The banks grew rapidly on borrowing and have assets eight times Iceland's GDP. But the party has come to an end, with the krona losing more than half its value against the euro in the past 12 months, inflation at 12% and interest rates at 15.5%.</p>",
  "<p>The International Monetary Fund today added its weight to the growing calls for a comprehensive and coordinated international response to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">global financial crisis</a>, which it says has become disorderly and more damaging than it previously thought.</p> <p>In its latest twice-yearly Global Financial Stability Review, the Washington-based institution dramatically raised its estimate of losses to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking+useconomy\">US banking system</a> to around $1.4 trillion (\u00a3800bn), 45% up from the $945bn it estimated in April and reaffirmed just two months ago.</p> <p>It also estimated that the major global banks need to raise some $675bn in new capital in the next few years. </p> <p>The IMF report was released as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/07/marketturmoil.royalbankofscotlandgroup\">shares in Britain's banks plunged once again</a>, following emergency talks with the government last night over a possible injection of billions of pounds of taxpayers' money into the banking sector.</p> <p>The IMF's managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said the report \"shows how serious a crisis we currently face\". </p> <p>\"The time for piecemeal solutions is over. I therefore call on policymakers to urgently address the crisis at a national level with comprehensive measures to restore confidence in the financial sector. At the same time, national governments must closely coordinate these efforts to bring about a return to stability in the international financial system.\"</p> <p>He spoke as European finance ministers were meeting in Luxembourg to try to thrash out some sort of response to the growing financial emergency, and looked likely to raise depositor protection to \u20ac100,000 (\u00a378,000).</p> <p>Jaime Caruana, head of the IMF's monetary and capital markets department, which authored the report, said: \"The global financial system has undergone unprecedented turmoil in the last few months, and the situation has worsened considerably since spring.\"</p> <p>He welcomed that countries were starting to discuss comprehensive international solutions, but added: \"Concrete actions, however, are needed to tackle insufficient capital, falling asset valuations, and a dysfunctional funding market. Such a comprehensive approach, if consistent among countries, should be sufficient to restore confidence and the proper functioning of markets, and avert a more protracted downturn in the global economy,\" he added.</p> <p>The IMF noted that the United States remained the epicentre of the financial crisis, with its housing market continuing to decline and a wider economic slowdown contributing to a further deterioration in the quality of existing loans.</p> <p>But it warned that Europe too faced problems because many of its own housing markets were also in retreat.</p> <p>Drawing on its experience of earlier crises, the IMF recommends that national authorities consider five ways to help restore confidence in what it calls \"these exceptional circumstances\":<br>\u2022 employ measures that are comprehensive, timely, and clearly communicated<br>\u2022 aim for a consistent and coherent set of policies to stabilize the global financial system across countries<br>\u2022 ensure rapid response on the basis of early detection of strains in order to contain systemic repercussions<br>\u2022 assure that emergency government interventions are temporary and taxpayer interests are protected<br>\u2022 avoid losing sight of the objective of a more sound, competitive, and efficient financial system going forward.<br></p>",

Our kids talk to elders with more respect than some of our professional care providers.\" </p> <p>She said she considered elderspeak a form of bullying. \"It's talking down to them,\" she said. \"We do it to children so well. And it's natural for the sandwich generation, since they address children that way.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>To this I give a mighty harrumph. When my father had Parkinson's disease in the final years of his life, I was appalled at how these care-givers spoke to him as if he were about a seven-year-old child. Here was a man who had been a distinguished trial attorney, who read about a book a week on subjects ranging from history to science to the flow of global capital and The New Yorker and The Economist and so forth nearly every week of his adult life. And care givers, asking him what kind of shirt he wanted to wear that day, talked literally as a mother would talk to a little child.</p> <p>They meant well. They loved him. But this was a problem, and clearly still is. Something must be done!<br></p>",

A good doctor takes the patient's pulse, temperature, listens to heartbeat, looks for symptoms of problems and asks questions about diet, lifestyle, history and environment. Many of the distressed companies have been on a diet of toxic debts, off balance sheet accounting, dubious asset values and questionable business models. Yet the auditors did not notice any of the red flags.</p> <p>Auditors continue to act as advisers to the companies that they audit. They are hired and remunerated by the very organisations that they are supposed to be auditing. The auditor's dependence for fees on corporate barons makes it impossible for them to be independent. Their understanding of the businesses that they audited must also be doubted. The auditing industry has consistently failed to provide value for money.</p> <p>No doubt the auditors would point out that that all of the above audits<br>complied with all extant auditing standards. That, if anything, further<br>confirms the poverty of the present auditing requirements. By all accounts the current auditing model is broken and cannot be repaired. This was also evident from audit failures at Maxwell, Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), Enron, WorldCom and numerous other scandals. Yet successive governments have always given in to the well-oiled accounting lobby, which prefers feather-duster audits and fat fees. The only effective way forward is for the regulators to take direct responsibility for auditing banks and financial institutions.</p>",

  "<p>The UK government must set a 2050 target of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">cutting all greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80%</a>, according to its own climate watchdog.</p> <p>Lord Turner, chair of the independent Climate Change Committee, said the power sector must almost totally decarbonise by 2030 to achieve this 2050 target.</p> <p>Politicians, business leaders, scientists and campaigners alike have welcomed the report, but the electricity producers called the target \"ambitious\" and stressed the need for a new generation of nuclear power plants. </p> <p><strong>Martin Rees, president of the Royal Society</strong></p> <p>\"The government set up the Climate Change Committee to get sound, independent advice. Now it is imperative that it heeds it. If we are to avoid the worst effects of climate change, we must make serious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>\"The UK can show real leadership on tackling climate change and a key part of this is investing in low carbon technologies. The first step should be to only grant approval for new coal fired power stations on the basis that they will have their operating permits withdrawn unless they are capturing 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2020. That would also give the UK a head start in developing a green energy technology with huge economic potential.\"</p> <p><strong> Steve Webb, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman</strong></p> <p>\"There is now no excuse for either the government or the Conservative party not to back the Liberal Democrats' amendment to the bill, which calls for 80% cuts by 2050.</p> <p>\"Once a tough target is in place, the rest of government policy must follow suit. It is no good having a target if the rest of government is pointing in the opposite direction.</p> <p>\"Unrestricted airport expansion, new coal-fired power stations and a massive road-building programme will all pump up emissions and are totally incompatible with this new target.</p> <p>\"The test of the new Climate Change department will not be whether it has a trendy new logo, but whether it has the clout to stop other cabinet ministers undermining these vital climate change goals.\"</p> <p><strong>Spokeswoman, Association of Electricity Producers</strong></p> <p>\"It is important that all sectors are engaged in emission reductions and we are pleased that the Climate Change Committee recognises this. By 2030, the power sector is expected to reduce its emissions significantly, but total decarbonisation, as suggested by Lord Turner in his interview, is an ambitious goal.</p> <p>\"Electricity companies are already investing heavily in low-carbon technologies: 5% of the UK's electricity is currently generated by renewables. That is a fast-growing sector. Nuclear power, which at present accounts for around 20% of electricity production, will also be important. If we want to maintain a high level of security of supply and become greener, we will need to look at all technologies, including carbon capture and storage.\"</p> <p><strong>Dr Neil Bentley, CBI director of business environment</strong></p> <p>\"Raising the target to 80% will increase the challenge to business, but we believe that UK firms will continue to rise to this challenge. We agree with the committee's assessment that such a major emissions reduction can be achieved at a manageable cost, but only if the right policies are put in place.\"</p> <p><strong> John Sauven, Greenpeace executive director </strong></p> <p>\"If we are to almost totally decarbonise our electricity sector in the next 20 years, as Turner suggests, then the new climate minister Ed Miliband must focus on cutting-edge renewables, energy efficiency and super-efficient combined heat and power plants. It can be done, but we'll know if this government is serious when they announce whether Heathrow expansion and a new coal plant at Kingsnorth will get the green light.<br>\"A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that a new fleet of coal plants would hole the new target below the water line, while Labour's current ambitions for aviation expansion would finish it off.\"</p> <p><strong>David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK</strong></p> <p>\"We are delighted that the Committee accepts that emissions from aviation and shipping - the fastest growing sectors - must be included in any credible target.</p> <p>\"However, it is crucial that the UK shows true leadership by demonstrating a commitment to deliver a low-carbon economy - through delivering the bulk of emissions reductions in the UK rather than relying excessively on imported carbon credits.\"</p> <p><strong>Greg Clark, the Conservative party shadow climate change secretary</strong></p> <p>\"I am delighted that Lord Turner has brought forward his recommendations which create a more logical framework for further debate about the Climate Change Bill. We have made it clear that the recommendations of the climate change committee will shape the policies pursed by a Conservative government. Meeting an 80% reduction target would present major challenges especially given the government's poor performance in recent years. However, with the right policies, there would be clear economic benefits from ensuring that Britain plays a leading role in creating a greener and safer world.\" </p> <p><strong>Professor Roger Kemp, Lancaster University, and Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering</strong></p> <p>This target \"will be a challenge greater than fighting both the banking crisis and the \"war on terror\" at the same time. And it will go on for decades.</p> <p>\"The engineering challenge is huge but possible, the political challenge will require a level of courage not seen in the present crisis. The government's policy that developing the new [power] stations should be left to the markets is just not plausible \u2013 particularly with the banking crash soaking up available funds. If part-nationalisation of banks is considered acceptable, why not at least the same level of state financial guarantees to kick-start the low-carbon energy business?\"</p> <p><strong>Philip Wolfe, Renewable Energy Association</strong></p> <p>\"The vital test of UK commitment to combating climate change is what government does with renewables and energy efficiency right now. We have less than 10 years left to start bringing emissions down if we are to avoid dangerous climate change. We therefore look to the new Department for Energy and Climate Change to back the Renewable Energy Tariff measure in the Energy Bill over the next few weeks. If this is done it will empower everyday people and businesses all over the UK to invest in renewable and significantly contribute to the carbon dioxide cut.\"</p> <p><strong>Andy Atkins, executive director Friends of the Earth</strong></p> <p>\"The committee's advice is fantastic news. If we are to play our part in avoiding a climate catastrophe, the new climate law must require future governments to slash UK emissions by at least 80 per cent by 2050.</p> <p>\"The climate change law is a trail-blazing piece of legislation \u2013 but the Government must now strengthen the Bill to help make Britain a world leader in developing a low carbon economy.</p> <p>\"But we cannot afford to ignore pollution from international aviation and shipping \u2013 that would be like going on a calorie-controlled diet and ignoring the calories from chocolate bars. The Bill currently has a loophole allowing future Government to continue to ignore these emissions - ministers must act to close it.\"</p> <p><strong>Phil Bloomer, Oxfam's director of campaigns and policy</strong></p> <p>\"This report supports what we have been saying for some time. The government must tackle climate change with the same urgency it is showing in confronting the global financial crisis. </p> <p>\"Current economic problems cannot be used as an excuse for inaction. Without action now, the devastating impacts of climate change will dwarf today's economic difficulties, especially for poor people in developing countries, who are being hit first and hardest.\" </p> <p><strong>Merlin Hyman, director of the Environmental Industries Commission</strong></p> <p>\"We welcome the committee's focus on energy efficiency and believe that a step change in the way we use energy in the UK is the cheapest and most effective way of meeting the targets. We urgently need, therefore, a range of policies for securing energy savings right across the economy that are as equally ambitious as today's recommendations.\"</p>",

  "<p>If Ed Miliband, secretary of state at the new Department for Energy and Climate Change, fails to take radical action to decarbonise the UK's economy, it's not for lack of good, expert advice. Taking pride of place on his desk this morning must be <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\">the letter from Adair (Lord) Turner</a>, chairman of the Climate Change Committee, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">makes an unarguable case</a> for deep and rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, built on sound science and economics.<br> The 60% <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/10/carbonemissions\">emissions reductions target</a> contained in the Climate bill is not good enough, it says. We need a cut of at least 80% cut by 2050, and this target \"should apply to the sum of all sectors of the UK economy, including international aviation and shipping\". Moreover, the cut can be achieved affordably, costing the UK just 1-2% of GDP in 2050. Given uncertainties about fossil fuel prices, this estimate \u2013 in line with Nicholas Stern's projections in <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm\">his famous Review</a> \u2013 is close to saying that there will be no cost at all. In the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/06/climatechange.carbonemissions\">event of high fuel prices and supply constraints</a>, decarbonising the UK's economy will almost certainly yield net economic benefits as it ends our dependence on fossil energy.<br> One important reason for tightening the target is that the committee has grasped an important truth. As temperatures rise, non-linear effects will come into play that will amplify warming, such as methane release from permafrost and oceans. Beyond a threshold level, these runaway warming processes are likely to become uncontrollable, and lead to further irreversible impacts, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheets. \"The world may be able to adapt to small changes in temperature change,\" writes Lord Turner, \"but once higher increases are experienced damages will exceed the adaptive capacity of many biological, physical and social systems.\" Thus, it is essential to steer well clear of a 4C temperature rise, which would lead to \"extreme consequences potentially beyond our ability to adapt\", and \"limit the central expectation of global temperature rise to, or close to, 2C\". Taking into account the larger than anticipated role of greenhouse gases other than CO2 \u2013 such as methane and the HFC gases used as refrigerants \u2013 and the need for the UK as a wealthy and highly polluting country to lead on emissions reductions, the UK's proper share of emissions reductions comes to at least 80%, within a global emissions reduction of 50-60%. My only objection to the committee's interim advice is that while it is making all the right arguments, it does not go far enough. We are already experiencing positive feedbacks in the climate system with our present degree of warming of barely 1C, notably with the Arctic summer ice melt. The idea that a 2C temperature rise is in any way safe is more wishful thinking than science \u2013 for all the reasons set out by Turner about the non-linear climate response to emissions. There is now a growing awareness that we should achieve global emissions neutrality by 2050 \u2013 that is, that all residual greenhouse gas emissions taking place by that date should be balanced by CO2 uptake in soils, forests and oceans.  But the committee's advice has to be welcomed, nonetheless. It spells out the actions we should be taking: the systematic decarbonisation of the entire UK economy, including power generation, transport, heating and industry, with a strong reliance on technological innovation backed by public investment and regulation \u2013 and the urgency of embarking on that path without delay. Gordon Brown has already indicated that he will accept the target, and Ed Miliband has been left with little wiggle-room \u2013 just supposing he wants it. The target must now be made law in the forthcoming Climate Act \u2013 but most importantly, it must be backed up by action. As we know from the government's failure to meet its legally binding target on fuel poverty, to pass a law is one thing, to fulfill the obligation is another. The real challenge is for the future. </p> <p>Ed, for all our sakes, don't flunk it!</p>",
  "<p>Pope Benedict has passed his own judgement on the economic crisis, suggesting that the global financial system is built \"on sand\".</p> <p>\"Whoever builds his life on this reality, on material things, on success ... builds (his house) on sand. Only the word of God is the foundation of all reality,\" he said yesterday, according to Reuters.</p> <p>The pontiff added: ''We are now seeing, in the collapse of major banks, that money vanishes, it is nothing. All these things that appear to be real are in fact secondary. Only God's words are a solid reality'.'</p> <p>He was referring to Jesus's words in Matthew, chapter seven, in which the prophet warns those who do not heed his words \"shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand\".<br> </p> <p>The pope's comments echoed views expressed by two of the Church of England's most senior clerics last month.</p> <p>Dr Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, wrote in the Spectator, that \"unimaginable wealth has been generated by equally unimaginable levels of fiction, paper transactions with no concrete outcome beyond profit for traders\".</p> <p>Williams added that Karl Marx had been right in his assessment of the nature of capitalism \"if about little else\".</p> <p>The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, said the market took its rules of trade \"from Alice in Wonderland\" and branded speculators who had short-sold shares \"bank robbers and asset strippers\".</p>",
  "<p>British manufacturing production fell for a sixth month in a row in August to post its longest run of falling output since 1980, official figures showed today.</p> <p>The figures add to an increasingly gloomy economic picture and add strength to calls for the Bank of England to cut interest rates from 5% at its monthly meeting on Thursday.</p> <p>David Page at Investec said: \"It's a lot worse than the markets were expecting. The slowdown shows that the UK economy is suffering on all fronts.</p> <p>\"We expect worse to come. We think this continues to argue for support for the UK economy which we expect to find coming from the monetary policy committee on Thursday.\" </p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output fell 0.4% in August from the previous month \u2014 twice the drop expected by City economists \u2014 and was down 1.9% on a year ago, the biggest annual drop in more than five years. Production has fallen every month since March. The last time output was down for such an extended period was between July and December 1980.</p> <p>Most categories suffered declines but the transport sector, which includes car manufacturing and shipbuilding, was particularly hard hit, with a 2.3% slump.</p> <p>The figures indicate that the manufacturing downturn is deepening, analysts said, putting the entire economy on course for recession. Howard Archer at Global Insight expects GDP to shrink by 0.4% next year.</p> <p>Industrial production, which includes utilities and mining, fell by 0.6%, also worse than expected. That took the annual decline to 2.3%, the biggest drop since March 2005. Output was dragged down by sharp falls in utilities production and oil and gas extraction.</p> <p>While the weaker pound should make life easier for British exporters, this is countered by weak demand in key export markets such as the eurozone and the United States.</p>",

  "<p>People are bored. There is plainly a desire for change.

Meanwhile, in the current FACT, <a href=\"http://www.factmagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=828&amp;Itemid=52\">Kiran Sande despairs</a>, brilliantly, at the, \"steady, sterile pulse of T-Mobilized minimal techno that's boring Europe's dancefloors to death.\"</p> <p>That is, perhaps, a better line than it is cast iron fact. <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/anjaschneider\">Anja Schneider</a>, Dinky and the brilliant <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/marcinczubala\">Marcin Czubula</a> have all recently released iridescent albums which owe an obvious debt to the minimal aesthetic. The difference is that all three have brought new elements into play: delicate melodies, vocals, abrasive electro sounds, classical piano, jazz twangs, house tones and Latin percussion, to create something much closer, in spirit, to the mischievous warmth of original 90s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microhouse\">click or micro-house</a>, than the deadpan, intellectual sonic surgery that people (sometimes unfairly) associate with Poker Flat and <a href=\"http://www.m-nus.com\">M_Nus</a>.</p> <p>But, if minimal's over, what's next? Well, more of the same. Only different. Subtle shifts, suitably enough.</p> <p>Logically, this should be boom time for maximal dance music, a la Crookers and Herv\u00e9. And it might be, in Britain. But, the German scene and media - as British Matt \"Radio Slave\" Edwards enthused on a recent edition of DVD-magazine, <a href=\"http://www.eb-slices.net\">Slices</a> - isn't prey to the same vicious swings, the same boom-bust, hype-kill cycles. \"Evolution not revolution\" is Germany's style and, with Berlin unlikely to cede its position as electronic music's global centre, that is where the most exciting innovations are still going to come from.</p> <p>I was out in Berlin a few weeks ago, and the most obvious change is that (deep) house music is back. After a fashion. At Weekend and Watergate, things were altogether funkier, richer, a little less electronic - there were even (mangled) snippets of vocals. Tellingly, it's not a minimal producer, but Mannheim's house-orientated <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/johnnydjohnny\">Johnny D</a> who has emerged this summer as possibly Germany's next big thing.</p> <p>Not that Berlin is throwing the animatronic baby out with the bathwater. The <a href=\"http://www.juno.co.uk/products/318569-01.htm\">approach</a> of much-tipped Watergate resident, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/onurozer\">Onur \u00d6zer</a>, is illustrative. He drops bits of traditional Turkish folk, ambient classical music and old school house vocals into his sets, in among housier tracks and, yes, much rippling, wonky minimal weirdness. \u00d6zer has transcended minimal's sparse, clean sound palette, but he's clearly still inspired by its adventurousness.</p> <p>Elsewhere, I saw Ricardo Villalobos play ambient soundscapes before an Ulrich Schnauss gig, at Berghain, as part of new night, <a href=\"http://www.beatportal.com/feed/item/preview-elektroakustischer-salon-at-berghain\">Elektroakustischer Salon</a>. If minimal brought avant-garde electronica to the dancefloor, it's only natural that it's more cerebral exponents may now travel the other way. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the dubstep/techno crossover, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/aug/25/sceneandheard\">already charted on this blog</a>, has captured Germany's imagination. Nowadays, all the good Berlin and Hamburg record shops have bulging dubstep (and, more pertinently, dub-techno) sections, while <a href=\"http://www.juno.co.uk/products/325032-02.htm\">Shed's Shedding The Past</a> album - which may come to be seen as a bit of a <a href=\"http://www.factmagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1009&amp;Itemid=32\">dub-techno benchmark</a>- was on prominent display everywhere.</p> <p>Just as electroclash transformed the way dance music thinks and looks; minimal transformed the way it sounds. Therefore, it is only right, that as it <a href=\"http://www.beatportal.com/feed/item/minimal-techno-is-mainstream\">becomes a cliche</a>, as it begins to soundtrack TV ads, minimal - as a formula, as a sound - should be ruthlessly dispatched. Minimal's wider sense of sonic daring, however, is going to be with us for years to come. Hopefully.</p>",

  "<p>More than 370 young penguins, who were mysteriously washed up on tropical beaches in Brazil, have been airlifted to safety in cooler water.</p> <p>A Hercules military aircraft flew the flightless birds to Pelotas, in south Brazil, where they were released to cheers from a group of spectators.</p> <p>The young birds were among a thousand Magellanic penguins, which have appeared on Brazil's warm north-east shores over the last few months.</p> <p>The other birds either died or were too unhealthy to send back.</p> <p>The healthy penguins, which had been kept at an animal rehabilitation centre in Salvador, north-east Brazil, were flown 2,500km (1,550 miles) south on a plane usually used for transporting military hardware.</p> <p>They were released with a smaller group of adult penguins that had been rescued after being caught in an oil slick.</p> <p>Experts from the International Fund for Animal Welfare, who helped organise the airlift, hope these older birds will guide young ones south to the Patagonia.</p> <p>Magellanic penguins breed in large colonies in southern Argentina and Chile, and migrate north as far as south-west Brazil between March and September.</p> <p>Environmentalists have said it is not known why the penguins were stranded so far north, but suggest they could have been carried beyond their usual range by a flow of warm water.</p> <p>\"We are overjoyed to see these penguins waddle back to the ocean and have a second chance at life,\" said Valeria Ruoppolo of IFAW. </p> <p>\"Hundreds of penguins died in this unusual event and while media reports have often linked global warming to the penguins' demise, at this point there is no way to know for certain why these animals stranded.\"</p>",
  "<p>Human evolution has virtually ground to a halt, according to genetics expert Prof Steve Jones of University College London.</p> <p>Jones, from the department of genetics, evolution and environment at UCL, argues that mechanisms for evolution are dwindling and, as far as evolution is concerned, we have arrived at utopia or as close to it as we are likely to get.</p> <p>In the first of a series of <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lhl\">lunch-hour lectures</a> at UCL today, Jones will say that the end of evolution is partly due to a shorter age of reproduction for men.</p> <p>In the west, men are becoming fathers later and there are fewer older fathers, which means a sharp drop in the number of genetic mutations possible.</p> <p>Jones will outline three components of evolution \u2013 natural selection, mutation and random change.</p> <p>\"In ancient times half our children would have died by the age of 20. Now, in the western world, 98% of them are surviving to the age of 21. Our life expectancy is now so good that eliminating all accidents and infectious diseases would only raise it by a further two years. Natural selection no longer has death as a handy tool,\" he will say.</p> <p>\"Mutation, too, is slowing down. Yes, there are chemicals and radioactive pollution \u2013 but one of the most important mutagens is old men. For a 29-year-old father (the mean age of reproduction in the west) there are around 300 divisions between the sperm that made him and the one he passes on \u2013 each one with an opportunity to make mistakes.</p> <p>\"For a 50-year-old father, the figure is well over a thousand. A drop in the number of older fathers will thus have a major effect on the rate of mutation.</p> <p>\"Perhaps surprisingly, the age of reproduction has gone down \u2013 the mean age of male reproduction means that most conceive no children after the age of 35. Fewer older fathers means that, if anything, mutation is going down.\"</p> <p>Randomness as a key ingredient in evolution is also often forgotten, Jones will say. \"Humans are 10,000 times more common than we should be, according to the rules of the animal kingdom, and we have agriculture to thank for that.</p> <p>\"Without farming, the world population would probably have reached half a million by now \u2013 about the size of the population of Glasgow. Small populations which are isolated can change \u2013 evolve \u2013 at random as genes are accidentally lost.</p> <p>\"Worldwide, all populations are becoming connected and the opportunity for random change is dwindling.\"</p> <p>Jones will add that the west is becoming a melting pot of ethnicities and, almost everywhere, inbreeding is becoming less common.</p> <p>\"In Britain, one marriage in 50 or so is between members of a different ethnic group, and the country is one of the most sexually open in the world. We are mixing into a global mass, and the future is brown.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"So, if you are worried about what utopia is going to be like, don't; at least in the developed world, and at least for the time being, you are living in it now.\"</p>",

  "<p>I must confess, at the outset, that Dominic Couzens, the author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Top-100-Birding-Sites-World/dp/1847731090\">Top 100 Birding Sites of the World</a>, is a good friend of mine. He is also, in the friendliest of ways, a rival \u2013 we both write about birds and wildlife. </p> <p>I like to think we share a particular view about birding \u2013 that although it is wonderful to jet around the world enjoying exotic places and birds, there's no place like home. Birding on your local patch \u2013 even in your garden \u2013 is for us the essence of daily life.</p> <p>But now Dominic has revealed a guilty secret \u2013 one which I admit lurks in even the most dedicated local patch enthusiast. He longs to leave his Dorset home, and for a short time at least, his lovely family, and head to the world's most far-flung birding sites. <br><br>From the <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sites/index.html?action=SitHTMDetails.asp&amp;sid=2327&amp;m=\" 0\" \">Camargue</a> and <a href=\"http://www.andalucia.com/environment/protect/donana.htm\">Coto Do\u00f1ana</a> in Europe to <a href=\"http://www.indiawildlifeportal.com/bharatpur-bird-sanctuary/birds-in-bharatpur.html\">Bharatpur</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.hk/eng/maipo/wildlife/birds/\">Mai Po</a> in Asia; the <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sites/index.html?action=SitHTMDetails.asp&amp;sid=6288&amp;m=\" 0\" \">Bale Mountains</a> in Ethiopia to <a href=\"http://gorp.away.com/gorp/location/latamer/peru/manubio.htm\">Manu</a> in Peru, and some really remote locations, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_Birds_of_New_Caledonia\">New Caledonia</a> and <a href=\"http://neseabirds.com/Antarctica/ant996.htm\">South Georgia</a>, this book contains a mouth-watering century of great places to go to watch birds, written in an informative and very readable style. </p> <p>Like every keen birder who picks up this book, I did what I always do when confronted with a 'top 100' \u2013 I worked out how many sites I had visited myself. Fourteen doesn't seem all that many, especially given that some, like <a href=\"http://www.birdsofbritain.co.uk/reserves/norfolk.asp\">north Norfolk</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.fatbirder.com/links_geo/europe/scotland_western_isles.html\">Outer Hebrides</a>, are pretty close to home. But when I started reminiscing about days I had spent in these wonderful locations, my mood changed.</p> <p>Outside Britain, one of the first top 100 locations I ever visited was the <a href=\"http://www.andalucia.com/environment/protect/donana.htm\">Coto Do\u00f1ana</a> in southern Spain. I was filming a Spanish-language series for the BBC, and was privileged to be accompanied by Tono Valverde, who had been on the pioneering expeditions here back in the 1950s. Sadly this wonderful place, once described as \"Europe's largest wilderness\" had gone the way of so many other wetlands, and been drained for agriculture and development. </p> <p>The same applies to <a href=\"http://www.eilatbirdsfestival.com/\">Eilat</a> in Israel, a migration hotspot which has undergone heavy tourist development. <a href=\"http://www.birdtours.co.uk/tripreports/brazil/braz2/Iguazu2001.htm\">Iguassu Falls</a> on the Argentina/Brazil border, and <a href=\"http://www.birdcapemay.org/\">Cape May</a> in New Jersey, have fared better, managing to integrate tourism (much of it of the eco variety) with the environment.</p> <p>Others, such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belovezhskaya_Pushcha\">Bialowieza forest</a> in south-east Poland, remain virtually unchanged over centuries \u2013 this enchanted forest is home to nine species of woodpecker and a host of other woodland birds, though they are fiendishly hard to find amongst the thick foliage. </p> <p>Of all the sites I have visited, the most intensely concentrated birding experience of all is from the balcony at the <a href=\"http://www.asawright.org/\">Asa Wright centre</a> in Trinidad \u2013 once described by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/who/bill_oddie.shtml\">Bill Oddie</a> as \"arguably the best place to watch birds in the world\".<br> <br>So what makes a top birding site? Non-birders might consider spectacular scenery to be a high priority \u2013 but a birder enjoying a visit to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werribee_Sewage_Farm\">Werribee Sewage Farm</a> near Melbourne, featured in Sean Dooley's excellent book <a href=\"http://www.thebigtwitch.com/\">the Big Twitch</a> would probably disagree. Number of species would certainly justify the inclusion of <a href=\"http://gorp.away.com/gorp/location/latamer/peru/manubio.htm\">Manu</a>, where almost 1,000 different kinds of bird have been recorded. </p> <p>But what about <a href=\"http://neseabirds.com/Antarctica/ant996.htm?\">South Georgia</a>. This sub-Antarctic island boasts fewer breeding species than my Somerset garden \u2013 but with literally tens of millions of individual birds, including millions of penguins, it certainly justifies its place in the book.</p> <p>Accessibility is also important: I shall probably never visit Bhutan or Colombia, but chances are that one day I shall pass through Hong Kong, and spend a day watching waders at the legendary <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.hk/eng/maipo/wildlife/birds/ marshes\">Mai Po</a>. </p> <p>One of my favourite birding experiences ever was at <a href=\"http://www.birdtours.co.uk/tripreports/argentina/arg6/CostaneraSur2000.htm\">Costanera Sur</a> in the heart of Buenos Aires, where an early morning outing brought me more than 50 'lifers' before I had to catch a plane back home. For business travellers, <a href=\"http://www.nhbs.com/title.php?tefno=141721\">Where to Watch Birds in World Cities</a> by Paul Milne is a useful and practical companion to the \"trips of a lifetime\" outlined in Dominic Couzens' book.</p> <p>But I can still dream \u2013 and of all the 86 sites I haven't yet visited, three stand out as truly special: the aforementioned <a href=\"http://gorp.away.com/gorp/location/latamer/peru/manubio.htm\">Manu</a> and <a href=\"http://neseabirds.com/Antarctica/ant996.htm\">South Georgia</a> \u2013 surely the two most contrasting birding sites on the planet \u2013 and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantanal\">Pantanal</a> in the lowlands of Brazil. </p> <p>With a wealth of waterbirds, and the magnificent (and highly endangered) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinthine_macaw\">Hyacinth Macaw</a> this really would be my dream destination\u2026 In the meantime, as autumn winds blow over the Somerset Levels, I'll just have to make do with the birds in my garden!</p> <p>So where have you been that you consider a top birding destination?

  "<p>From supermarkets and oil companies to individuals, nations and continents, people are talking about reducing their carbon footprints. Statistics, targets and goals abound. But what do the aims such as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">80% cut by 2050 suggested in Britain's climate watchdog</a>? How does your country's pledge measure up? And just how many parts per million carbon dioxide are too many?</p> <p>Here, we explain how such climate goals are set, and why they may not be enough.<br><strong><br>Carbon levels</strong></p> <p>The level of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is measured in parts per million (ppm) in a given volume of air. The figure was about 280ppm before the industrial revolution and has been creeping up since. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/may/13/carbonemissions.climatechange\">latest reading was 387ppm</a>, and the figure is rising at about 2ppm each year as emissions continue unabated.</p> <p>But carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas: methane, nitrous oxide and numerous others also trap heat as they accumulate in the atmosphere, and must be included in calculations. To do this, scientists group them together, work out how much heat they trap, and calculate the amount of carbon dioxide that would be needed to cause a similar effect. The two figures are then added together, and called carbon dioxide equivalent - CO2[e].</p> <p>The extra load from the other greenhouse gases bumps up the pure carbon dioxide concentration by up to a fifth. So, roughly, 400ppm CO2 = 450ppm CO2[e] and 550ppm CO2 = 650ppm CO2[e]. </p> <p>In predicting the likely temperature rise under a given emissions scenario, the all-inclusive CO2[e] figure is the important one, though this is not always made clear.<br><strong><br>Stabilisation goals</strong></p> <p>In 1996, the European Union said the world should limit the global temperature rise to 2C above preindustrial levels, and that this meant limiting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to 550ppm CO2[e]. In reality, the relationship between carbon dioxide levels and eventual temperature rise is less precise. Scientists now talk only about likely ranges. The <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/Independent_Reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm\">2006 Stern Review</a> said that 550ppm CO2[e] would drive temperatures up by between 1.5 and 4.5C, with a median rise of 3C. It said the world should aim for a stabilisation goal of between 450 and 550ppm CO2[e].</p> <p>The lower end of that range (450ppm CO2[e]) is now commonly associated with a 2C rise, and the upper end (550ppm CO2[e]) with a 3C rise. In fact, scientists say that at 450ppm CO2[e] there is still a 50% chance that the 2C target will be exceeded.</p> <p>Jim Hansen, Nasa's top climate scientist, says that even a 2C rise may not avoid dangerous large scale impacts such as melting of ice sheets, and says world CO2 should not be allowed to remain above 350ppm CO2, significantly below its current level \u2013 that means removing CO2 from the atmosphere and burying it.<br><strong><br>Targets and timetables</strong></p> <p>The world has not yet set a global goal to limit carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but 450ppm CO2[e] is often used as an example. In 2007, the G8 group of nations converted this target to a 50% cut in world emissions by 2050. As any new climate deal is likely to permit developing countries to continue increasing their emissions for the foreseeable future, the bulk of this burden will fall on rich countries such as the US and Britain. Britain's share of the load could be as much as a 95% cut of national emissions by 2050.</p> <p>In anticipation of such a demand on them, several countries including Britain have unilaterally pledged to cut their emissions. Several have also set interim targets, such as the EU's pledge to reduce emissions 20% by 2020, rising to 30% if enough countries follow its lead. Cities, companies and states have also set targets. Here is a selection:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-334713552\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/06/09/carbontargets3.jpg\" alt=\"Carbon targets\" width=\"460\" height=\"328\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Moving the goalposts?</strong></p> <p>Some scientists have criticised climate targets as based on \"anecdotal rather than systematic\" information. Others point out that they can fail to include all sources of emissions. Britain's original climate change bill, for example, failed to include pollution from aviation and shipping, though its climate watchdog now recommends they are included. </p> <p>David King, former chief scientific adviser to the government, has said it is critical that official targets are \"seen to be achievable\". This has led to a stand-off between both campaigners and scientists who complain that domestic targets are not ambitious enough, and politicians who fear setting unrealistic goals. Some scientists are even saying that the G8's global goal of 50% reductions by 2050 - already very difficult to achieve - is not enough. </p> <p>In May, experts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the G8 goal \"will not avoid global impacts\". They said the target should be tightened to a 80% cut in world emissions by 2050.</p> <p>Many observers believe radical political leadership is essential if such severe cuts are to be achieved, with the summit taking place in Copenhagen in December 2009 seen as a pivotal moment. The scale of the task was highlighted this month by the UK Met Office, which warned that global <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/oct/01/climatechange.carbonemissions1\">greenhouse gas emissions would have to start falling by 3% from 2010</a> to stand a chance of limiting warming to 2C. Global emissions are currently rising.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/05/children.socialexclusion\">Last Saturday's rally</a> by the Campaign to End Child Poverty deserved wider coverage than it received. The campaign's work and research findings, <a href=\" http://www.endchildpoverty.org.uk/news/news/child-poverty-under-the-microscope/23/131\">published last week</a>, are a reminder, for those who needed it, that economic hardship and a widening chasm between rich and poor did not begin with the credit crunch. They go back to before the Blair years. They continued through them and under Gordon Brown.</p> <p>The figures on child poverty on Britain, in the third term and 11th year of a so-called Labour government, returned with majorities beyond the dreams of Harold Wilson, are symptoms of a deep <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/07/brown.economic.policy\">sickness in our society</a>. </p> <p>In my own constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow are some of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7641734.stm\">highest concentrations</a> of child poverty anywhere in the country. There are 23,450 children, 79%, living in poverty. Neighbouring Poplar and Limehouse is not that different. </p> <p>Across Tower Hamlets as a whole in 2007, two-thirds of children were living in \"income-deprived families\" (how Orwellian the language of public policy has become), making it the most deprived borough in England on that measure. </p> <p>The incidence of child poverty is directly linked to lack of work and dependency on benefits. Despite these root causes children, parents, teachers and education officials in Tower Hamlets have done extraordinarily well in raising the level of educational achievement \u2013 a success praised by the End Child Poverty Campaign. </p> <p><a href=\" http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/failure-on-child-poverty-targets-is-moral-disgrace-842780.html\">Responding</a> earlier this year to news that the government was going to miss its target of halving child poverty by 2010, Sir Al Aynsley-Green, England's children's commissioner, said: <br> </p> <blockquote> <p> Poverty is, in our view, the single most pernicious influence that is blighting the lives and prospects of our young people. We are one of the richest countries in the world. Yet Unicef has found that we have some of the highest levels of poverty. Poverty underpins most of the other social issues we are concerned with.</p> </blockquote> <p>We also have the unhappiest children in Europe. Beneath the aggregate statistics lies an ocean of suffering. It is not simply the overall family income that is stunting the lives of children in east London. Housing, health and welfare inequalities are cutting them down at an early age. It is by no means unusual for constituents to turn up to my surgery looking to be rehoused because they are living 12 or 14 to a two-bedroom flat. <br> To repeat \u2013 this was going on throughout 2005 to 2007, and before I became the MP. It was going on while New Labour and their clique were boasting endlessly of the economic bounties they were bestowing on Britain. It was going on while Gordon Brown assured us \u2013 against all experience and contradicting the insights of even sophisticated pro-capitalist economists \u2013 that he had abolished the boom/slump cycle. </p> <p>And through those years the people of east London saw the gleaming spires of finance capital soar higher and higher in the City of London and Canary Wharf, dwarfing the inhabitants in between. The wealth would trickle down sides of the Gherkin and the NatWest Tower, we were assured. Instead, the poorest got swept down the gullies. And now it is going to get a lot worse, quickly. <br> The official anti-poverty strategy for Tower Hamlets cites the 90,000 jobs \"created\" at Canary Wharf as central to progress. But scarcely any of those jobs went to people living in Tower Hamlets. And now, as the empty Lehman Brothers offices bear witness, the question is how many of those jobs are going to go over the next few months.  It is not only Brown and New Labour who stand hopelessly exposed by the turn of events. So too are David Cameron and the Tories. Their call for an end to casino capitalism and for tighter regulation of the finance sector falls into the category of telling the biggest whopper you can think of in the hope that the public will be so stunned they'll doubt their own critical faculties.  This is the same Cameron who says he wants to be as radical in the social field as Margaret Thatcher was in economics. It sounds like a darkly mumbled line from Marlon Brando in the Godfather. I can only imagine that it means something like shutting every social services department and getting rid of red-tape such as legislation guaranteeing children's rights. It was under Thatcher that child poverty doubled. The steps proposed by both parties are hopelessly inadequate. The Liberal Democrats don't even enter the picture thanks to their hapless leader choosing this of all moments to lurch towards the free market \u2013 watch the space between those shoulder blades.  As this financial crisis deepens, people will want radical policies \u2013 more like the New Deal of Roosevelt than Blair's workfare scheme of the same name. Already public ire has turned against the stockbrokers, the hedge-fund managers and the City slickers. </p> <p>It is becoming clearer by the day that an emergency programme of radical anti-poverty and anti-recessionary measures is required. The signal from Brown's reshuffle is that he is going to do exactly the opposite. Who on earth in the Brown circle thinks the Peter Mandelson has traction with Labour people? Putting him in charge of business is a sign that it will be the bankers and the chief executives, and no one else, who get to enjoy a lavish welfare state and economic protection. </p> <p>From the Chicksands Estate and the Roman Road there's a burning resentment at what's been done to this country and its children. A glance at the history of the East End should give the powers that be fair warning: they'd be ill-advised to ignore the suffering lapping at their gates.</p>",
  "<p>What was the worst year in your life? What was the worst year in Britain's recent past? And the wider world's? I ask because history now has us in her grip and, like a shark, may be in no hurry to let us go again. Where will it all end?</p> <p>\"But surely we are always in history's grip,\" said a colleague on hearing this observation yesterday. Yes, sort of, but only gently so. Britain has not really been at the eye of the global storm since the summer of 1940 when the Royal Navy, the RAF and that shallow ditch, the English Channel, stood between us and Hitler's war machine.</p> <p>Scary, inspiring stuff and it was only a year later that my mother, back in the relative safety of Cornwall with her new baby (my brother), was able to say: \"We're saved\" on hearing Hitler had invaded Russia. Only when Japan attacked the US at Pearl Harbour six months later did Churchill, who bore a strong resemblance to my brother at the time, dare say: \"So we have won after all.\"</p> <p>Is the crisis on that scale now? No, not yet. No bombs fall on our cities as a result. But it is the fallout from great events that lead to bombs, domestic and foreign. An FT pundit ventured to suggest last week that the great crash of 1929 was the key event of the 20th century. Why? Because it caused the great depression, Hitlerism and global war in 1939-41-45. </p> <p>That evolved into the cold war (1946-89) which dominated much of our lives at the time. Looking at a bruised, recovering Russia today, its airforce and navy on the prowl again, it may be creeping back in a less stable form \u2013 facing a less stable, poorly-led United States, no longer disciplined in the way it was.</p> <p>That's what happens. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989-91 led to foolish triumphalism in the US \u2013 that \"end of history\" rubbish - just at a time when the free market crowd, tired of the restrictive structures which had emerged from the ruins of 1945, were regaining power, bent on unleashing unfettered market forces again. </p> <p>\"Taking the airbags and bumpers off the Volvo,\" as I like to put it. The car just crashed. But 2008 will have greater claims to being a turning point than that because it was also the year of the Beijing Olympics, a symbolic event which told us China is back. As everyone now agrees the crash has tilted a lot of power from west to east \u2013 which it will prove impossible wholly to re-tilt, if at all.</p> <p>That's why history has us all in its grip this year. When did something on this scale last happen? For Russians, now enjoying our discomfort, it was obviously 1989. For Americans 9/11/01 was the worst national shock since Pearl Harbour \u2013 an unexpected attack by a lurking foe. Yet the banking crisis dwarfs 9/11, making Osama bin Laden (he's gone a bit quiet) look like an opportunist mugger. This time they bombed themselves.</p> <p>Every country has their own traumas. Britain and France were humiliated by the doomed invasion of Suez in 1956, the year the Russians temporarily reasserted their grip over Hungary (and elsewhere). With the additional burden of failing colonial wars in Algeria and Vietnam France duly collapsed in Gaullist modernisation in 1958. </p> <p>Britain staggered on towards Thatcherism 20 years later. For miners, steel workers and printers \u2013 too cocky to spot that Rupert Murdoch was not like the other Fleet St stuffed shirts \u2013 the trauma years were 1979-84, when they fought to save their jobs and way of life from what were really incipient global forces. The Falklands war was just a local blip \u2013 like the Venetian fleet sent to take on the Barbary pirates of Morocco just before Venice finally expired in 1797.</p> <p>Partly, of course, it always depends what happens next. After defeat in Vietnam the US bounced back, economically and politically - militarily too. It \"won\" the cold war. But victory can be elusive, pyrrhic - as someone called the problem long ago. The outcome in Iraq \u2013and the wider Middle East \u2013 remains unclear. For Arabs, incidentally, Israel is too much like the \"crusader\" Latin Kingdom which disrupted their region for much of the Middle Ages before it succumbed to Ottoman power (which finally crumbled in 1918).</p> <p>With hindsight 1949 is the great turning point year in China. A monster he may have been, but Mao will be remembered as a great emperor in the Chinese tradition. Unfair to the millions of dead, but that's the way history often plays it when she opens her jaws. Stalin too gets a pretty good press at home. Corpses have no vote.</p> <p>Against such turbulent backdrops, life goes on. We eat, drink, make love, go to work; are born, get educated and (usually in that order) married (or not), have kids and die. A few weeks after Harold Macmillan succeeded the Suez-wrecked Eden in January 1957 my poor mother dropped dead. I was 11. Everything changed for ever. Enough said.</p> <p>On the big canvass, the FT pundit was wrong. 1929 was a consequence of what had gone before. The most significant year of the 20th century was 1914, when the great powers of Europe finally went to war, the culmination of Germany's steady overthrow of the balance of power achieved at Waterloo in 1815, another epochal year.</p> <p>As a result the Europeans ruined themselves and paved the way for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Millions of dead, desolation and bankruptcy, four great empires \u2013 Russia, Germany, Austria and Turkey - all fell. </p> <p>In doing so they gave rise both to national self-expression (good) and rampant nationalism (bad). They also spawned the fluke that was Lenin's seizure of power in Moscow and St Petersburg. The remaining European empires \u2013 including ours \u2013 staggered on. But the age of Europe was over.</p> <p>Is the same fate now creeping up on America? Maybe, though a friend, by no means a fan of US global power, who recently visited Silicon Valley was still astonished by its continuing inventiveness. But the US will need much better leadership than usual to get out of the hole it has dug for itself. It consumes far too much, more than it \u2013 or the planet \u2013 can afford.</p> <p>William Rees-Mogg, former editor of the Times, whose column is often wrong but usually interesting, asked yesterday if Barack Obama has it in him to become the new Franklin Roosevelt. Good question, but a tall order. </p> <p>I agree with Moggy in his assertion that FDR was a \"very, very great president\" in depression and war, in fact the supreme political leader of the century past.</p> <p>It was FDR in his inaugural address in 1933, who said \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself \u2013 nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyses efforts to convert retreat into advance.\" </p> <p>We could all do with a bit of that because we have not touched bottom yet.</p> <p>What's your hinge year? How was it all for you?</p>",

Shares in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup\">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> were down by 30%, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay\">Barclays</a> 8% lower and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/hbos\">HBOS</a> down by 6%.</p> <p>Yesterday \u00a393bn was wiped off the value of Britain's top 100 companies as the leading index plunged by 391.1 points - its third-worst <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/table/2008/sep/19/ftse100.worst.days\">daily decline in percentage terms ever</a>.</p> <p>There has been a late recovery in Asia thanks to a shock interest rate cut in Australia.</p> <p>The Federal Bank of Australia astounded the markets by cutting interest rates by a full percentage point overnight, to 6%. The move raised hopes of combined action by the world's central banks to try to stimulate the global economy.</p> <p>\"We could see a relief rally today, with predictions that Australia's move could be the start of concerted action,\" explained Manus Cranny of MF Global Spreads.</p> <p>\"But if that is what the market is hanging its hat on, then it could be sorely disappointed,\" he added.</p> <p>The Bank of England will set UK interest rates on Thursday, and business groups are already demanding a half-point cut to 4.5%.</p> <p>European finance ministers are meeting in Luxembourg today to discuss the crisis. Europe's failure to agree a coordinated rescue package for its banks was a major factor behind yesterday's sell-off, so there is pressure for progress.</p> <p>\"Until such time as the banking sector is not totally reliant on Central Bank intervention and until trust is restored amongst the banks, there can be no measurable improvement in equity prices,\" warned David Buik of Cantor Index.</p> <p><strong>Australia shows the way</strong></p> <p>Yesterday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/06/dowjones.creditcrunch\">on Wall Street the Dow Jones was down by 800 points at one stage</a> before closing at 9955, down 370.</p> <p>The global financial turmoil continued overnight with more sharp falls in Asia and the shock interest rate cut by Australia.</p> <p>Australia's central bank said it was relaxing its monetary policy in an effort to stop economic growth deteriorating as the mayhem in the financial markets continues.</p> <p>\"Economic activity in the major countries is also weakening, and evidence is accumulating of a significant moderation in growth in Australia's trading partners in Asia,\" said the Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens.</p> <p>Heavy selling has pushed Japan's Nikkei index down by 5% to its lowest point since December 2003, before it later recovered somewhat to close 2.2% lower at 10155.9 points.</p>",
  "<p>The global financial turmoil continued overnight with more sharp falls in Asia and a shock interest rate cut by Australia.</p> <p>Australia's move raised hopes of concerted action by the world's central banks in an effort to avert global recession.</p> <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia had already been tipped to cut rates, but it stunned the markets by slashing them by a full percentage point - twice as much as expected - to 6% in a move that brought some comfort to investors.</p> <p>The central bank said it was relaxing its monetary policy in an effort to stop economic growth deteriorating as the mayhem in the financial markets continues.</p> <p>\"Economic activity in the major countries is also weakening, and evidence is accumulating of a significant moderation in growth in Australia's trading partners in Asia,\" said the Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens.</p> <p>Analysts believe that other central banks may soon follow Australia's lead and cut interest rates in an attempt to prevent the global economy lurching into a deep recession.</p> <p>The Bank of Japan, though, left rates unchanged today at 0.5%. The Bank of England will set UK interest rates on Thursday, having held them at 5% for the last five months, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/07/creditcrunch.marketturmoil\">businesses are already calling for a hefty cut</a>.</p> <p>Australia's move also brought some optimism to stockmarkets across Asia, where traders were in a very nervous mood following yesterday's slump in London, where the FTSE suffered its biggest fall since 1987. </p> <p>Heavy selling has pushed Japan's Nikkei index down by 5% to its lowest point since December 2003, before it later recovered somewhat to close 2.2% lower at 10155.9 points.</p> <p>Almost \u00a3100bn was wiped off the value of Britain's biggest companies yesterday, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/06/dowjones.creditcrunch\">on Wall Street the Dow Jones was down by 800 points at one stage</a> before closing at 9955, down 370.</p> <p>The FTSE's slump accelerated yesterday afternoon when chancellor Alistair Darling refused to announce a rescue plan for the UK banking sector. Today he will convene with fellow European finance ministers in Luxembourg.</p> <p>The meeting is likely to be heated, with several European governments having announced separate banking rescues. Darling is expected to announce his own plans soon, possibly taking stakes in several high street banks.</p>",
