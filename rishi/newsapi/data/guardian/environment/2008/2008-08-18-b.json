  "<p>Chinese shares slumped to a 20-month low yesterday with airlines, oil companies and other stocks dropping sharply amid anxiety about the economic outlook.</p> <p>The continuing slide - which saw the benchmark index close 62% below its peak last October - comes on top of concern about a post-Olympic hangover and news last week that factory gate inflation had hit a 12-year high.</p> <p>The Shanghai composite index shed 5.3% to close at 2,319.87, while the Shenzhen composite index slipped 5.9% to 656.08.</p> <p>Analysts had hoped that weekend discussions between regulators and the official media would produce an announcement of some help from the government. But the talks suggested that the authorities \"would not take any move to save the poor market\", said Zhai Peng, a strategist at Guotai Junan Securities in Shanghai.</p> <p>The China Securities Regulatory Commission said it was concerned about the plunge and would try to stabilise the market, but Zhai said its comments were \"far below investors' expectations\".</p> <p>Airlines, which reported falling demand last month partly due to Olympic-related visa restrictions, were among today's biggest losers. China Southern Airlines, Air China and China Eastern Airlines all fell by about 10%.</p> <p>Oil refiners also suffered and coal shares sagged after the announcement of export taxes to address a coal shortage.</p> <p>Exporters have been hit by the global downturn and rising costs. The consumer price index - a headache for the government for much of the year - fell to a 10-month low of 6.3% in July. Yet the producer price index soared, hitting a 10% increase year on year.</p> <p>\"So far the burden has all been on companies because there's so much overcapacity no one has any room to pass on the costs,\" said Andy Rothman, CLSA's China strategist, blaming the increase on higher global prices for raw materials and energy. \"We are starting to see companies going out of business. After six to 12 months, the survivors will have less competition and be able to raise prices more. But it's a very slow, gradual process.\"</p> <p>He suggested CPI, already down from 8.7% to 6.3%, would fall to 5% by the end of the year because it had been driven by food price growth that had now halted. He added that he still believed China's slowdown would be a mild one.</p> <p>\"All of the indicators this year have been within expectations; the economy has slowed down to prevent inflation,\" added Zuo Xiaolei, chief economist of Galaxy Securities, citing the government's \"two prevents\" of avoiding economic overheating and rising inflation.</p> <p>Michael Pettis, finance professor at Peking University, predicted that inflation could reach 8% or 9% by December and warned that domestic consumption could stall.</p> <p>\"The spending numbers have been quite good recently, but it could be because of the Olympics,\" he said. \"It seems hard to me to say that we won't see some sort of short-term hangover at least.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the mid-1960s Don Shiach, who has died aged 69, began teaching at Holland Park school, west London, then fast becoming one of the country's most famous comprehensives. In later years, he would become a prolific author and successful internet entrepreneur, but at Holland Park, where he became head of English, he cut a Lawrentian figure. He had dashing good looks, a clear-sighted intellect and an apparent sternness belied by a great generosity and sense of fun.</p> <p>Don then became head of English at Woodberry Down school, in north-east London, under the headship of the pioneering educationist Michael Marland. In the early 1970s he also became a director of Group 64, a young people's theatre centre in Putney.</p> <p>He left teaching in the late 1970s to become a writer. He was the author of more than 30 books, many of them educational bestsellers, including Framework English (1979), From Page to Performance (1987) and The Critical Eye (2004). He also worked as an external examiner and moderator for English GCSE and A-level.</p> <p>Born in Aberdeen, the son of a monumental stonemason and clerical worker in a city laundry, Don was the second of three sons. He won a scholarship to Robert Gordon's college, Aberdeen, and graduated in English from Aberdeen University in 1959. After training as a teacher, his early professional experience included a spell at Sydenham school for girls, south London. </p> <p>Don was a lifelong, if always independent-minded, socialist. He inadvertently found himself at the centre of a controversial moment in party history when he was elected chair of Bermondsey Labour party during the notorious 1983 byelection, in which the Labour candidate, Peter Tatchell, was defeated, after being the subject of a homophobic campaign. Don steered the party through this stormy period with authority and tact.</p> <p>Latterly, he devoted himself to his first love: cinema. In 1993, he was awarded a doctorate from Sussex University for a thesis on the MGM career of Vincente Minnelli. He subsequently taught on art house and Hollywood cinema, and wrote, among other books, The Films of Peter Weir (1993); The Movie Book; An Illustrated History of the Cinema (1998); Jack Nicholson: The Complete Film Guide (1999), and Stewart Granger: The Last of the Swashbucklers (2006). He was somewhat bemused in recent years at the global success of his movie memorabilia business, Moviedrome. </p> <p>Don was loyal to his roots, retaining a lifelong passion for Scottish rugby. His first marriage to Frances Smith was dissolved in 1969. He met his adored companion, the actor and teacher Jean Woollard, in the mid 1970s. They married in 1984; she survives him. </p>",
  "<p>A few things have changed since the Proms began back in 1895. Fifty years ago, only two Proms were televised. This year, there is a prime-time slot every Saturday on BBC2, and regular broadcasts on BBC4. And 50 years ago, there was a great deal of concern about the look of the thing - sometimes more than the music itself. In 1958, an internal BBC memo about the opening night broadcast noted that a mezzo soprano's \"dress was unanimously cordially disliked - has the Television Service not the right of discussing the matter of dress with soloists in order that they should look as well as possible on the screen? The cut-away shots to members of the audience should be handled with care. While the thoughtful girl made a most attractive picture and interfered in no way with the music, the shots of the youth in the grey topper and of the shop-girl wagging her head in time to the music are frankly not conducive to concentration on the music, and I think better kept to the intervals between items.\" It was observed that some of the first-night promenaders wore \"comic hats\", and that the orchestra and conductor were greeted with streamers. This year's first-night audience was much better behaved.</p> <p>One of the biggest changes we've seen has been the broadening of access that radio, TV and interactive services now offer. When Henry Wood and Robert Newman came up with their original vision for the Proms, of introducing new audiences to high-quality classical music, they could not have imagined the size and reach of today's global audience. Fifty years ago, the season ran for two months - but not every night, as now. Then, there were only 49 concerts (compared to 76 this year), and only five orchestras employed (33 in 2008). There were ballots for the first- and last-night tickets, and the programme guide (simply a list of concerts) was sixpence. </p> <p>But the biggest difference was in the concerts themselves, which were unlike any concert you would expect to hear today. I am fascinated by the art of putting a programme together, and so last month we presented a Prom from 1958 - an overture and a symphony by Mendelssohn, and a piano concerto and a symphony by Brahms. The hall was packed, and it prompted a fascinating debate about the nature of today's programming. Are modern concerts too short? Is it too much for players to perform such a long programme? And - most interestingly, given that we now have so much music available to us, all of the time - are audiences still equipped to take in a concert of this length? We did allow one concession to modern times and gave the audience a second interval. Did they really drink much less in 1958, or did audiences have stronger constitutions?</p> <p>I am often struck by how formulaic so much of our concert life has become. Is 7.30pm really the best time for a concert - and why are they usually in two parts? Why perform a concerto in the first half, and a symphony in the second? Why not mix chamber groups, choirs and orchestras? Why not introduce some concerts informally from the stage? Of course, the answers to some of these questions are purely economic; but all too often we seem to fall for the easy solution, driven by a lack of curiosity about how best to present music today.</p> <p>We've tried to break the mould with some Prom concerts this year - for example, putting music by Xenakis for six percussionists between Vaughan Williams' Sinfonia Antartica and Holst's The Planets. We could have put another piece of British music there, but I hope it will be much more interesting to come back to The Planets after a bracing dose of noisy contemporary percussion. Or, in a Messiaen choral programme, rather than more French choir music we've added music for sitar: Messiaen was influenced by Indian classical music, so why not put these two worlds together and see how they illuminate one another? </p> <p>Later this week, the Proms is taking another look back into the past, when the G\u00fcrzenich Orchestra from Cologne performs Mahler's Fifth Symphony. This orchestra premiered the symphony in 1904, and so we are presenting the works performed alongside it then - not as an experiment or a history lesson, but because Mahler's Fifth is one of those pieces in constant danger of becoming too familiar, as are the pieces that normally, predictably, sit next to it - a classical concerto, a symphony, or nothing.</p> <p>The original programme was a revelation to me. The new symphony was first in the programme, followed by four Schubert songs and Beethoven's Leonora No 3 overture. It seems incredible now that such a huge piece should have opened the concert. Today, there is still a strange, and I think misguided, desire to put a new piece first - as if to get it out of the way so that everyone can relax and enjoy the rest of the evening. I don't know if people thought along the same lines then, but the opening trumpet call makes an arresting start to any evening. Personally, I think a new piece should only go first if it makes sense with the rest of the programme. </p> <p>For Friday's Prom, we have asked four composers to orchestrate the Schubert songs and, just for good measure, have added Punkte by Stockhausen (Friday would have been his 80th birthday). I hope the audience sticks with it: I suspect that, by the time we get to the Beethoven, we will hear his remarkable overture in a far fresher light than in the context of an all-Beethoven concert.</p> <p>When concert-going gets tired and predictable, we are doing generations of great musicians a terrible disservice. Programming should make us renew our love of standard repertoire, as well as seek out unfamiliar works: those composers who created the foothills of our musical landscape are as much a part of this as the musical mountains.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Prom 48: G\u00fcrzenich Orchestra</strong> is on Friday at the Royal Albert Hall, London SW7.

  "<p>When I was about seven, growing up in Krakow, Poland, I was taken to my first piano lesson. I no longer know what impelled my mother to do so. It was the kind of thing that aspiring middle-class parents did for their children, as a way to assure proper cultivation, and perhaps some upward mobility. But for me, it was instant enchantment. There was the piano itself - a polished baby grand, and undoubtedly the most beautiful object I'd seen in anyone's house, in a materially bleak postwar Poland (my Jewish parents had survived the Holocaust by hiding in Ukraine). But it was when the rather unprepossessing woman who was to teach me sat down to play that I suddenly felt I was in the presence of magic. The sounds emanating from under her fingers had the loveliness, and liveliness, of a quick-flowing mountain brook. Then there was the precision, the sheer control she was exercising to produce that pearly stream of sound. Even as a child, I could see that there was a kind of mastery in that, a personal authority.</p> <p>\"All art aspires towards the condition of music,\" Walter Pater famously pronounced, and many artists and writers have testified to the potent impact of music on their work: as an art that can touch on the deepest sensations of which we are capable; an aesthetic ideal in which form perfectly coincides with content; a subject or stimulus for specific work; and sometimes, a concrete aid to creativity. </p> <p>Certainly, for me, a musical education has been one of the formative experiences of my life. For various reasons, it got complexly inter-braided with writing and literature, so that I no longer know which came first, or what would have happened if; or which exercised a greater fascination. I was always a word-besotted child, and as soon as I could read myself, especially the kinds of books which came from Krakow's old lending libraries, and sometimes had yellowed pages, I plunged into the tales between the covers as if into three-dimensional reality. </p> <p>Then came that music lesson, and, when I was deemed prepared enough, admission to the Krakow Music School, which was considered a grooming ground for future professional musicians. There, I discovered that music revealed worlds of emotional expressiveness, formal richness and technical challenge that were as vivid, as utterly compelling, as anything I had known. I did not have anything like perfect pitch, and balked at practising for hours; but for some reason, every shift of mood or tonal modulation in the pieces I played affected me as though they were conveying the keenest, most piercing messages. I never wondered what - or what kind of thing - a Bach Invention, or a Tarantella by a no-longer-remembered composer, said. That was perhaps unwittingly right of me, for music rarely \"says\" anything. But music speaks; and to me, as a child and young adolescent, it seemed to speak all beauty and human passion. </p> <p>When I started playing some of the more accessible pieces of Mozart, or Chopin or Beethoven, I seemed to summon a palette of feelings - tenderness, fury, robust joy, gentle melancholy - distilled to their most intense, their somehow absolute form. This was undoubtedly an illusion, for I had not yet experienced anything that would warrant such knowledge. But it is the mysterious power of music that it can evoke, through its lucid vocabulary of melody and harmony, discord or counterpoint, a range of sensation, intimation and emotion, with an immediacy that made me feel as though I was myself participating in its large and subtle drama. </p> <p>I'm afraid that, as I grew into adolescence, I sometimes indulged in fantasies of standing on stages in beautiful silk dresses. But while being trained as potential musicians in that warm, old-fashioned school, we students were given to understand that we were being inducted into a high and serious calling. Music, in postwar Poland, had enormous status and significance. For one thing, in a climate in which so much was forbidden, classical music was a permitted form of expression (the story on such western forms as rock'n'roll was more complicated). In an important way, music stood outside the sphere of political slogans and prevailing political falsehoods. And, in a country that produced Chopin and Paderewski, and which prided itself on its romantic spirit, the sheer love of music often reached a pitch of almost spiritual fervour. When the Chopin competition restarted in 1955, it quickly became a national event, with much of the country's citizenry glued to their radios, listening to the young performers, and parsing the opinions of the jury for political mendacity or prejudice. </p> <p>The Polish cult of music - particularly of romantic pianism - reached one of its peak moments in 1958, when Arthur Rubinstein made his first visit to Poland since the war. Rubinstein was an iconic figure: a native son who had achieved worldwide fame, who had now decided to return, and who was first and foremost known for his ravishing interpretations of Chopin. Indeed, to many, he seemed to be practically channelling Chopin, with a stunning immediacy, intimacy, elegance and grandeur. </p> <p>Rubinstein's concert in Krakow during that visit was one of the most memorable experiences of my early life. The concert hall was so overcrowded, and so heated with excitement, that at least one person fainted and had to be carried out. After the announced programme, members of the audience began shouting out requests for encores - culminating with Chopin's Polonaise in A major, which had been played over Warsaw's megaphones during the brief and hopeless moment of resistance against the Nazi invasion in 1939. At the end, the audience broke as one into a birthday song that says \"may you live a hundred years,\" and which basically meant, \"we love you\". Somehow, political, historical and musical meanings came together in that concert hall, making for a moment of collective transport that has since then been matched only by the Beatles or Bob Dylan. </p> <p>For me, shortly after that concert came emigration, to Canada and the US, and all the attendant dislocations, changes of direction, disorientation. In a radically changed environment, I continued for a while to study music; give student recitals, and even to play with orchestras on a few occasions - an experience that, it must be said, can spoil you for a while for the more mundane occasions of life. I also learned to thrill to other kinds of music, including some of those wicked, western ones. </p> <p>For a while, my piano teachers continued to be among the most important figures in my young life, as they had been in Poland. Music teaching is a true form of mentoring. It happens through an exact, close-up, hands-on process - sometimes literally so. I had one teacher of the Russian school, who guided my responses to the music through movements of his hand on mine. But in guiding your hand, the music teacher, to some extent, guides your self; and I learned all kinds of extra-musical lessons from this process: about the necessity of reining in my impatient excitement, if I wanted to give musical phrases their right breath; about how strict discipline frees up spontaneity; about the combination of effort and receptivity needed to learn about something, or perhaps even someone, outside yourself. In his book, The Craftsman, Richard Sennett notes that in playing an instrument, one needs to \"release\" the finger on a string or a valve; and that the idea of release, which travels from the physical to the mental, \"is also full of ethical implication, as when we surrender control - our grip - over others\". But then, it is one of the deep pleasures of learning music that it encompasses and calls upon all aspects of the self: physical, cognitive, affective. </p> <p>I did not, in the end, go on to become a professional pianist; I slowly started turning towards writing instead. How that happened is a story involving a few twists and turns, immigrant circumstances and youthful conflict. Perhaps I felt uncertain, especially after the upheavals of emigration, whether I could achieve the peerless brilliance of Maurizio Pollini, Alfred Brendel or Mitsuko Uchida. But there was also, as I went on to college and graduate school, my newly reawakened love of literature and ideas; and, just as saliently, the need to deal with my new, tense romance with language: the English language. It was one of the powerful lessons of emigration that language is not only something you use, but something that lives within you, that shapes your perceptions, and constructs your very self. Without it, I lost my conduit to my own subjectivity. And so, I wanted badly to recreate in my second language the relationship I had to my first. In a sense, I wanted English to become a fully expressive instrument; and for that, I needed to learn not only its vocabulary and grammar, but its inflections and rhythms, its specific music. </p> <p>That took a long time. But when I started writing, I found that music had become embedded in my mind, or cells, as a sort of template, a psychic paradigm for what I wanted, however presumptuously, to achieve in my new medium. There was the music of the language itself, which I wanted to mould, and which mattered to me perhaps all the more because it took me a while to become attuned to it. But there were also other, sometimes elusive qualities, which I wanted to transfer from music to words: a certain smooth fluency, whereby each note elides into the next with apparent seamlessness; the sense that a verbal, no less than a musical composition, needs to find its voice, its tonal register, which corresponds to some subtle pitch of mind, a perspective, or atmosphere; and that each work should strive for a form which arises from its thematic content, and gives it a fitting shape. </p> <p>Of course, as Pater knew, most forms of expression rarely attain the felt form, the condensed meaningfulness of music. Writing, especially in the extended medium of prose, almost necessarily deploys the materials of explicit narrative. It talks of specific situations or events, of \"what happens\", and sometimes what will happen next. Music also unfolds in time, and contains development, reiterations, turns of theme. But it rarely makes an argument, or \"tells a story.\" Its meanings are built through a self-referential, inner logic. Writing is made of discrete particles of perception; music can sometimes say everything at once, can express both grief and joy in the same chord. </p> <p>It is such disparities that make it famously difficult to write about music. And yet, eventually, I wanted to do just that; to try to translate into words the fantastic force I feel within music, and also, the all-absorbing experience of playing, of stepping right into the universes of Schubert, Bartok or Chopin. I have found it a great pleasure, as well as a great challenge, to attempt this. I don't think the utterly sensuous, and utterly impalpable nature of music can be described directly. But in writing about a pianist, I wanted to follow her from within, as she moves through the tensions and resolutions of the compositions she plays, their trajectories of mood and movement, their alternations between turbulence and serenity; and as she falls into states of mental and bodily concentration in which she almost becomes the thing she plays, and achieves moments of what can be only called transcendence. </p> <p>But I also wanted to explore the Janus face of romanticism, the way that the quest for transcendent meanings can lead to the drive for violence, as well as for sublimity. In my novel Illuminations, these two polarities meet - and eventually, terribly collide - in an encounter between Isabel Merton, the protagonist, and her increasingly fanatical nationalist lover. Because music adumbrates meanings rather than ideas, it is rarely ideological; but its intensities have appealed to extremist ideologues of all stripes. Lenin apparently loved Beethoven's Appassionata. But in another sense, music is the opposite of extremism, or the simplistic reductiveness of violence; a great composition can include anger and even rage, but it contains these within complex and multi-layered form; and almost always, the music we love works its way through the darker emotions to a more reconciled acceptance. </p> <p>Still, playing, and performing, can be heady stuff. For about a year after I made the decision to give up music professionally, I could hardly touch the piano, for fear that it would remind me of lost plenitude. Then I started playing again, less methodically, but with great enjoyment. And since then, I have found that writing, for all its arduousness, can also take you up whole. On a personal level, it has allowed me to explore new corners of the world; and also, aspects of memory and history, moral problems and social issues which have mattered to me intensely. It is the stretching demand of the linguistic medium that it allows you, indeed, calls on you, to apprehend experience in many dimensions, and in many kinds of ways: through discursive ideas as well as lyrical compression, from a critical distance as well as through empathy, by trying to grasp the realities of the external world, as well as the interior riddles of individual subjectivity. </p> <p>Luckily, there is no incompatibility between the two. Writing is something I now struggle with every day (well, almost every day). But music continues to be a source of pleasure, and sometimes profound meaning. Its origins seem to go back far into our evolutionary development, and its patterns seem to be deeply encoded in our neurological and biological substance. In his book, Musicophilia, Oliver Sacks, a physician and neurotherapist, hazards the guess that this form of love is akin to \"biophilia\"; that we have a natural affinity for music, as we have for organic life. Music, in his poignant case studies, heals the worst symptoms of dementia; it helps post-encephalitic patients to organise their movements; in cases of severe memory loss, it often remains after everything else is gone. It is as if music has the power to shape and bring into focus our neurological systems, to pattern, through its structured motion, the patterns and dynamics of our interior lives. </p> <p>I cannot listen to music when I write; it funnels me too completely into itself. But I would find it difficult to live without a piano. However, the piano is there, providing reassurance that music is one of the infinite resources, of which there never need be a shortage; there to draw on for contemplation, consolation, release, and even inner health.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Illuminations </strong>by Eva Hoffman is published by Harvill Secker at \u00a316.99</p>",

  "<p>A gold medal to Jackie Ashley for her positive thinking, enthusiasm and optimism about the 2012 Olympics and its potential beneficial effect on the nation's health (These Olympian feats can inspire our obese nation, August 18).</p> <p>I was in Trafalgar Square when the announcement came through that London had won the right to host the Olympics in 2012 - it was a mouth-watering prospect then, and it still is now. Like Ashley, I prefer to see the London Olympics as a golden opportunity to inspire millions of ordinary people up and down the country to adopt healthier lifestyles. Sure, we can take a cynical view and moan about facilities not being built on time and our less than perfect record of building major projects, but, in truth, the problems we have encountered in the past in this area have been more down to interference from above than the lack of professionalism of our architects, engineers and builders.</p> <p>So let's be positive about us successfully delivering the greatest show on earth in four years' time, and also in transforming millions of people's attitudes to sport, fitness and nutrition. <br><strong>Andy Walker </strong><br>Bury, Lancashire</p> <p>The examples of the US and Australia, in particular, show that phenomenal sporting success and an obesity problem go hand in hand when government focus is predominantly on elite sports. This will be exacerbated in the UK by the cuts in funding for grassroots sports to help pay for the 2012 Olympics.</p> <p>It might be hoped that watching the Olympics on television inspires others to emulate Team GB's success, but the vast sums of money that nations spend on training athletes and hosting the games would be much better spent on providing the facilities and social environment to enable people to walk, cycle, swim and run safely.<br><strong>Paul Keeling </strong><br>Welling, Kent</p> <p>One of the great pleasures of watching the Olympics on television has been witnessing the delight of essentially ordinary British people being rewarded for exceptional achievements.

My concern is that, like Chris Boardman before them, their post-Olympic careers will become a search for due remuneration by switching to road stage racing in Europe. This is unsuited to track riders and would be like expecting a sprinter to take on marathons and excel. I would love to see an effort, made by media, sponsors and cycle sport bodies, to raise the profile of track racing to the level where such deserving athletes can earn their due living without having to chase the lucre on the road. <br><strong>Martin Powers </strong><br>Buckhurst Hill, Essex</p> <p>Great news about all the cycling medals at the Olympics.

  "<p>When Sam, her daughter, left school, Carol Robbie hoped she would continue her education. But when her college application was turned down, her mother didn't know where to turn. Sam, who has severe learning disabilities, dyspraxia, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism, had very limited options. </p> <p>\"I could understand why the college said no,\" says Robbie. \"Given her needs, they felt they couldn't guarantee Sam's safety. Still, I was absolutely gutted.\" </p> <p>Robbie needed to continue working full time, so day care was the only option. But Robbie was unhappy with her local respite centre: \"The carers were nice, but the activities on offer were totally inappropriate. There was no progression. It seemed more about keeping Sam occupied than helping her move on.\" </p> <p>There are an estimated 210,000 people with severe and profound learning disabilities in England. Many young people, like Sam, end up in inappropriate adult day centres once they have left school or find themselves isolated, without any services. Fewer than one in 20 go into paid work.</p> <p>A government white paper called Valuing People, published in 2001, promised greater rights, inclusion, independence and choice for young people with learning difficulties. It recognised the need to start planning their transition to college or work from the age of 14.</p> <p>Research carried out by the Norah Fry research centre a year later suggested a fifth of young people had left school without a transition plan. Almost half had little or no involvement in planning for their future. There were few options available to them, particularly when it came to employment.</p> <p>In Valuing People, the government recognised that some college courses and some day-care provision were unsuitable for young adults with learning disabilities. Inappropriate courses and day care were cut, but in many cases they have not been replaced with something better. </p> <p>A recent Learning and Skills Council (LSC) report shows college places have been cut by almost 15%. </p> <p>Provision is patchy and access to opportunities can be a postcode lottery. But there are examples of good practice. </p> <p>The Leighton project in Camden, north London, helps 16- to 25-year-olds move into paid work, training or further education. </p> <p>The two-year programme, currently funded by the LSC, offers life skills, vocational training and a three-month work experience placement, one day a week. </p> <p><strong>Work placements</strong></p> <p>Yagmir Onglu, 22, has just finished a placement at Highgate library, helping with shelving, tidying and issuing books. She says: \"Since I started the course I feel like a grown-up person. I'm an adult now, not a baby.\"</p> <p>Kevin Riley, 21, did his work experience at John Lewis on Oxford Street. He shadowed another employee, helping to put stock on the shelves. With the support of project staff, he was able to travel independently to work from his home in Tottenham. </p> <p>Before this, both Onglu and Riley had completed various college courses, typical of those available to young adults with learning disabilities. These may suit some, says project manager Jenny Pounde, but for many, there is a lack of progression.</p> <p>\"The frustrating thing is that after two years with us, some of our young people do get to the point where they are ready to work,\" says Pounde. \"They need some support to get started, perhaps for someone to work alongside them for a few weeks or months, but there is no funding for that. Fast-forward a few months, and they can be back to square one.\"</p> <p>Employers can be reluctant to provide opportunities for young people with learning disabilities, particularly as some can only manage part-time work and often need to work close to home. </p> <p>Rabbi Yitzchak Freeman, chief executive of the special-needs charity Kisharon, which provides care and education for members of the Jewish community with learning disabilities, agrees there is very little funding for supported employment.</p> <p>He cites an example of a pilot scheme in north London that had \u00a3150,000 worth of funding to employ 15 \"job coaches\" to support young adults with learning disabilities. \"The funding dried up after a year, and that was the end of that,\" he says. </p> <p><strong>Low expectations</strong></p> <p>Freeman believes employers are missing out. \"Unfortunately, as a society, we've developed low expectations of people with learning disabilities. It's not uncommon to see people with learning disabilities working in your local supermarket, but that's not the only job they can do.</p> <p>\"They can be such a great asset. They are highly motivated, reliable, have a positive attitude, a good work ethic and can offer a good length of service.\"</p> <p>At Kisharon's Asher Loftus business centre, a social enterprise for young adults with learning disabilities, positions are on offer in a variety of businesses, including a bike shop, repair workshop, print shop and wood turning. </p> <p>\"In our print shop, they are creasing, folding, stapling, packaging and stuffing envelopes. In the cycle shop, we've been able to train young adults with learning difficulties to do routine bike servicing - dismantling, lubricating, reassembling the bikes,\" says Freeman. </p> <p>He believes the government has a responsibility to support the commercial sector to provide suitable employment opportunities, perhaps providing tax breaks or other incentives. </p> <p>Employers, too, must face up to their responsibilities. According to the Disability Discrimination Act, employers are legally obliged to make reasonable adjustments to help disabled people to work. \"For those with learning disabilities, a reasonable adjustment might be to offer a verbal application process and a trial period,\" says Freeman. </p> <p><strong>Government promises</strong></p> <p>Valuing People Now, a white paper published last December, has acknowledged the shortcomings of Valuing People. The government is promising \u00a319m in funding for transition support and a transition plan for every young person, with the aim of getting them into college or employment when they leave school.</p> <p>After a year in an unsuitable day-care centre, Sam Robbie's mother heard about a residential centre for young adults with similar levels of disability. </p> <p>\"Some people think that I'm heartless putting my daughter into residential care, but actually I'm giving her some independence, moving her on. </p> <p>\"She's in a more stimulating environment, she has friends. She's been to see Mamma Mia!, had a caravan holiday, gone bowling, and learned circus skills. She's learned to make her bed, she's done ironing. I'd never have been able to do that with her at home.</p> <p>\"What is important at this stage is that she is progressing, becoming more independent and leading a full life, which she has every right to do. I realise we are lucky. If we lived in a different part of the country, it could have been a completely different story.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The charity Enable Scotland has produced a free CD-rom to guide young people through the transition to adulthood. <br><a href=\"http://www.enable.org.uk\">enable.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>BHP Billiton yesterday played down fears that the boom which has driven commodity prices to record levels could turn to bust as global growth slows.</p> <p>The world's biggest mining group, involved in a $130bn (\u00a370bn) hostile bid for rival Rio Tinto, said it expected demand from developing countries, led by China and India, to offset the impact of weakening demand from developed economies. Commodity prices enjoyed their best run for 35 years in the first half of 2008, according to the Reuters/Jefferies CRB index, but fell 10% in July.</p> <p>Some analysts have argued that slowing demand from the US and western Europe will feed through to developing economies by reducing demand for their exports. Chief executive Marius Kloppers said yesterday that such a view over-estimated the importance of exports to the balance of the Chinese economy. </p> <p>\"We have always said that China is not an export-led economy. It is driven by domestic demand ... We think the supply side is going to have a harder time keeping up [with demand] than people think.\" </p> <p>BHP said that in the year to the end of June, revenue rose by more than a quarter to $59.5bn while profit from operations climbed about 22% to $24bn. Net profit was a record $15.4bn, a 12.4% rise. The company underlined its confidence by increasing the dividend for the year by almost 50% to 70 cents a share.</p> <p>\"Our results were outstanding in the context of a challenging supply environment which was characterised by unexpected disruptions, rising input prices, skills shortages and the further devaluation of the US dollar,\" the company said in a statement.</p> <p>Kloppers said that six months ago he had expressed the view that commodity prices would remain resilient and \"that view has not much changed\".</p> <p>BHP has a broad range of commodities, spanning petroleum, aluminium, base metals, iron ore and manganese to coal and diamonds. </p> <p>\"I think there is a difference between those [commodities] more leveraged to the emerging economies and those more leveraged to the developed economies,\" he said.</p> <h2>Price volatility</h2> <p>A debate is raging as to whether the recent surge in commodity prices has come to an end. After reaching highs this year, the price of many raw materials has tumbled. </p> <p><strong>The price of oil </strong>surged from $90 a barrel at the beginning of the year to a record $147 in July. </p> <p>The price then started to weaken as US demand slowed with the downturn in the economy. Yesterday it briefly edged above <strong>$115 a barrel </strong>on fears that tropical storm Fay - which is building strength in the Caribbean - could disrupt production in the Gulf of Mexico, before falling back to $111.</p> <p><strong>Gold </strong>had risen steadily to breach <strong>$1,000 a troy ounce </strong>in March as the value of the dollar plunged, but is now back below $800. Soaring demand from China and India had driven industrial metals such as <strong>copper and aluminium </strong>to their highest points in 10 years. </p> <p>These booming markets attracted financial speculators who pushed prices even higher. But weakness in the world economy has meant a fall in consumption, taking commodity markets off the boil. </p> <p>Consumption of aluminium, which Kloppers said is called the middle-class metal because it is heavily used in packaging, fridges and beverage cans, was much more linked to developed economies. Coking coal and iron ore were tied to developing economies where demand was more likely, on average, to be stronger.</p> <p>BHP said that in the short term it expected commodity prices \"to remain high relative to historical levels, albeit with higher volatility\".</p> <p>Although commodity prices increased strongly over the second half of the group's financial year, BHP said its costs had risen sharply, with higher charges for diesel, coke and explosives adding to the burden of labour shortages.</p> <p>Kloppers said that, unlike a number of its peers, BHP had increased its volume by 7% over the year and was looking for further growth in the current period. He noted supply remained constrained by the length of time needed to bring new projects on stream because of bottlenecks within the industry.</p> <p>BHP's confidence was well received. Its shares rose 8p to \u00a315.37 with stocks across the sector getting a boost from the company's upbeat tone. Matthew Kidman, head of investment at Wilson Asset Management, said: \"The outlook still looks good even though there may be some impact over the next six months from the weakness in western economies. BHP doesn't appear to be too worried, because of the ongoing demand coming from China's industrialisation.\"</p> <p>BHP's bid for Rio Tinto is being vetted by the European commission competition authorities, which are expected to rule on the matter towards the end of the year. If successful, it would be the world's second-largest takeover, behind Vodafone's acquisition of Mannesmann in 2000.</p>",
  "<p>Silvio Berlusconi's government was engaged yesterday in a vigorous damage-limitation exercise after Pope Benedict appeared to lend his moral authority to speculation that Italy was in danger of returning to fascism under the tycoon's hardline rightwing leadership.</p> <p>In his usual Sunday address, the Catholic pontiff expressed concern at \"recent examples of racism\" and reminded Catholics that it was their duty to steer others in society away from \"racism, intolerance and exclusion [of others]\".</p> <p>On any other day his remarks might have been seen as no more than a restatement of Catholic doctrine. But they came in the midst of a furious dispute over an editorial published by Italy's best-selling Catholic weekly, Famiglia Cristiana.</p> <p>In an editorial on Friday condemning recent government moves against immigrants and Roma, the weekly said it was to be hoped that fascism was not \"resurfacing in our country under another guise\". The censure outraged Berlusconi's supporters, many of whom are pious Catholics.</p> <p>The leader of his parliamentary group in the upper house, Maurizio Gasparri, announced he would personally sue the priest who is Famiglia Cristiana's editor, while the junior minister responsible for family affairs, Carlo Giovanardi, accused the magazine of \"ideological malice\". </p> <p>In an effort to calm the row the Vatican's spokesman stressed that Famiglia Cristiana was not authorised to speak for either the pope or the Italian bishops' conference - which, as the magazine's editor noted, it had never claimed to do. The pope's comments were seen by Berlusconi's critics as a signal that the Vatican was not distancing itself from Famiglia Cristiana's interpretation. Benedict cited in his address the story from the gospels of Jesus meeting a pagan woman and how he rose above his initial misgivings to perform a miracle for her daughter.</p> <p>The pope said: \"One of humanity's great conquests is the overcoming of racism. Unfortunately, however, there are new and worrying examples of this in various countries, often linked to social and economic problems that nonetheless can never justify contempt or racial discrimination.\"</p> <p>Berlusconi's family minister, Giovanardi, denied Benedict's words were aimed at the government. \"The pope has a global perspective,\" he said. \"He wasn't talking about Italy.\"</p> <p>Famiglia Cristiana's editor, Father Antonio Sciortino, said the pope \"was certainly speaking to the whole world\". But added: \"And therefore also to Italy where, sorry to say, there are many signs of racism that trouble us and which cannot be hidden.\"</p> <p>Urged on by allies in the anti-immigrant Northern League, Berlusconi has ordered a crackdown on crime and the illegal immigrants his government claims are responsible for a disproportionate share of it. This month the Berlusconi government ordered troops on to the streets to combat an alleged crime wave it blames largely on illegal immigrants and Roma. Interior ministry figures show that more than a third of the arrests carried out by police last year were of non-Italians.</p> <p>Illegal immigration has been made an offence, mayors have been given new security powers, and deportations have been stepped up. In June Famiglia Cristiana called a government plan to fingerprint Roma children \"indecent\". So far church leaders have been more outspoken in criticising the government's policies than the centre-left opposition party.</p>",
  "<p>The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, looked to a future beyond General Musharraf yesterday, affirming that America's ties to Pakistan went far deeper than the military dictator closely associated with George Bush's \"war on terror\".</p> <p>Although Rice paid tribute to Musharraf as \"one of the world's most committed partners in the war against terrorism\", there was a sense that few in Washington were mourning his departure. </p> <p>Rice said in a statement: \"We will continue to work with the Pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on Pakistan's future and its most urgent needs, including stemming the growth of extremism, addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability.\"</p> <p>The general's exit will undoubtedly force changes in how the administration deals with such a strategic region, and how it confronts the global problem of Islamist extremism. But those changes were being discussed before yesterday.</p> <p>At the very least, the era when Musharraf served as a one-stop shop for American interests in the region is at an end. </p> <p>As one of the first Muslim leaders to support Washington after 9/11, Musharraf risked alienating his own people by allowing US forces the use of Pakistani military bases. In return he cemented his power with an infusion of $10bn in US aid. </p> <p>But that partnership had long been seen in Washington to have outlived its utility. No matter who emerges as Musharraf's successor, it was widely acknowledged yesterday that American policy would now need to engage civilian as well as military and intelligence circles in Pakistan.</p> <p>\"Musharraf's departure signals the end of a de facto presidential form of government in Pakistan,\" said Shuja Nawaz, an analyst in Washington. \"He had concentrated power in his own hands by virtue of the fact that he was also head of the military.\"</p> <p>In any event, Bush has just 155 days left in the White House. Both his would-be successors, the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain, have indicated they would change course after the election.</p> <p>\"Both the Pakistanis and the Americans are going to have to decide what kind of policies they follow with regard to foreign affairs and economics, and that will depend in no small measure on the attitude that the US Congress and a new US president will bring to the entire region,\" said Paula Newberg, an analyst in Washington.</p> <p>Obama said yesterday he had long advocated a \"move from a 'Musharraf policy' to a Pakistan policy\".</p> <p>\"I hope all of Pakistan's friends will now seize the opportunity created by Musharraf's exit to focus on the urgent issues of today: confronting the threat of extremist violence, dealing with food and energy shortages, and helping the Pakistani people build a stable, secure, democratic future,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>McCain, in his statement, also indicated that the relationship with Musharraf had perhaps outlived its value to America. \"I hope that the elections for President Musharraf's successor will serve to reconcile the Pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally,\" the statement said.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, the Bush administration had been frustrated for some time with Musharraf. Administration officials began describing the relationship with Pakistan as \"complex\" and last week state department officials described Musharraf's struggle to hang on to power as an \"internal matter\".</p>",
  "<p>You put your finger on the main cause of rising food prices and shortages (Millions could starve as fertiliser prices soar, says UN, August 13). The input costs for non-organic, hi-tech farming have increased dramatically because artificial fertiliser prices increase with oil prices. The \"cheap\" food of the last 50 years has been based on our incredibly wasteful use of oil. Industrial agriculture involves turning oil into food because oil and natural gas are used to get nitrogen out of the air and into a sack of artificial fertiliser. All current GM crops are just as oil-dependent as any other non-organic farming system, which is one of the reasons why Prince Charles was right to criticise them so strongly. Future food security depend on us using renewable, solar-powered, organic techniques to produce food, and scientific research shows that worldwide organic farming could produce slightly more food than we currently have. GM crops have the added disadvantage of introducing completely new risks into the environment without any benefits of increased yield. <br><strong>Peter Melchett </strong><br>Policy director, Soil Association </p> <p>Kevin Nolan's letter (August 14) is a typical outburst from a physicist who cannot cope with the realities of life, with whose complexities biology grapples. If the commercial realities of GM pose problems, it is a result of thinking of his sort, which says the world must be inherently simple, because that's all I can cope with. GM is excellent if it does not have to accommodate the complexities of climate and the seasons, and is not presented as a commercial take-it-or-leave-it set of options, formulated by businessmen and biochemists who have the same cause-effect mentality as Kevin Nolan.<strong><br>Julian Vincent</strong><br>Biologist, engineer, University of Bath </p> <p>As an astronomer who has spent the past 10 years working at one of the world's leading genetics research institutes, I take strong exception to the misrepresentation of genetics by physicist Kevin Nolan. He refers to \"crude science practices\" and questions whether genetics is a \"true science\". Perhaps he is thinking of Gregor Mendel's simple experiments 150 years ago, but genetics in the 21st century bears as little resemblance to that as modern astronomy does to Galileo's first telescope. </p> <p>Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA in 1953. Less than 50 years later, the complete human genome sequence was published. Today, biologists at the Sanger Institute are using the genome to explore the workings of the human body and its diseases at the molecular level. That <br>is an astonishing achievement. To be sure, there are still many puzzles to be solved in genetics. But my biologist colleagues are engaged in a great scientific adventure, and I stand in awe and respect of them.<br><strong>Dr David Harper</strong><br>Sanger Institute, Cambridge</p>",
  "<p>Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the first lady of France and scion of Europe's urban elite, has risked the wrath of shepherds, trekkers and farmers by supporting the reintroduction of brown bears to the Pyrenees.</p> <p>In a letter addressed to several environmental groups, the wife of President Nicolas Sarkozy rejected the idea that the animals had disrupted the rural calm of the mountains and put local residents at risk since their arrival in 2006. Although difficult, she said, it was possible for people to live peacefully with their ursine neighbours.</p> <p>\"There should be no question, in our country, of choosing between bear and man,\" said the supermodel-turned-singer. \"We must find a balanced means of coexistence. On the one hand, the presence of bears in the Pyrenees reflects a willingness to protect biodiversity ... on the other, the support of the local population is essential.\"</p> <p>Bruni-Sarkozy's letter was greeted with delight yesterday by those in favour of the bears. But it will do nothing to increase her popularity among those in rural areas who are against them - and who claim her urban background disqualifies her from passing judgment. </p> <p>The arrival in the mountains two years ago of five Slovenian bears sparked fury among shepherds, who claimed the animals threatened their livestock. It also worried the tourism industry, which said visitors would be put off the region. </p> <p>Opponents of the release mounted a sustained- and occasionally violent - campaign, blocking roads, leading demonstrations and even planting honey pots laced with glass shards in the countryside. But their protests were largely in vain; there are now about 20 bears roaming the Pyrenees region.</p> <p>News of Bruni-Sarkozy's letter came days after a minibus carrying disabled children was attacked by a bear in the south-western Ari\u00e8ge region. The incident, in which no one was harmed, prompted opponents of reintroduction to call again for the bears' removal. \"The animals have been transported to a territory they are not used to,\" said a local critic. \"They should have been left at home.\"</p>",
  "<p>A paedophile who acted as a \"librarian\" for a global internet child abuse ring was handed an indefinite jail term yesterday after one of the biggest undercover police investigations into online child abuse.</p> <p>Philip Thompson, 27, collected almost 250,000 indecent pictures of children as part of a global ring that reached 33 countries, Teesside crown court heard. More than 3,000 of the images found on Thompson's computers were in the worst category of child abuse images.</p> <p>Fifteen children in the UK were rescued from abuse after analysis of images seized in the investigation, said a spokesman for the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop). The victims, who had been subjected to \"the most extreme levels of abuse\", were undergoing intensive counselling, he said. </p> <p>Thompson, who was unemployed and lived with his mother, admitted 27 charges, including 16 counts of making indecent photographs of children, seven of distributing indecent photographs of children and one of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity.</p> <p>Judge Michael Taylor said he would be imposing an indeterminate prison sentence for public protection. \"You have shown that you are a very dangerous individual indeed. I consider that you pose a very significant risk to the public and you are a dangerous offender.\"</p> <p>Thompson must serve at least three years and nine months and will be placed on the sex offenders register for life.</p> <p>During the investigation, which began in May 2007, police identified 360 suspects across the world and saved 15 children from abuse.</p> <p>Harry Hadfield, prosecuting, said police raided Thompson's home in February and recovered two desktop computers and a laptop. \"Forensic analysis by computer experts established that the defendant had 241,000 indecent photographs of children, being one of the largest seizures of indecent photographs in the UK.\"</p> <p>Thompson was the moderator for an online forum used to trade in child pornography, the court heard. \"The defendant's role was to police the website, which gave him the opportunity to transfer these images to his computer. The evidence recovered from his computer showed he had amassed a vast collection of indecent photographs of children. It appeared the defendant kept some of the most serious images to use as trading chips.\"</p> <p>Thompson's barrister, Brian Russell, said his client had cooperated fully with the police during their investigation.</p> <p>\"This is really a young man who has fallen into that stereotype of a rather sad and lonely teenager who spends too much time in a darkened room in front of a computer screen,\" Russell said.\"He has not had much life experience to get himself mature.\"</p> <p>Thompson used his computer skills to moderate an invitation-only website featuring borderline images of children. Once users had signed up, they would be offered access to more secretive online environments where images and information about vulnerable children were exchanged.</p> <p>Jim Gamble, chief executive of Ceop, said: \"This website, while appearing to operate on the margins of legality, was clearly a front for the sinister, sexual abuse of children and an image trading ground for paedophiles.</p> <p>\"There is a simple message for those individuals like Thompson who think they can go to this website - or indeed any space on the internet - and discuss their sexual interest in children and share images. You leave a digital footprint. We will track you down and hold you to account.\"</p>",
  "<p>'It is a trite observation that environmental problems, although they closely affect municipal laws, are essentially international; and that the main structure of control can therefore be no other than that of international law.\" Thus wrote Robert Jennings QC, a former president of the international court of justice, in his foreword to the first edition of Philippe Sands's Principles of International Environmental Law, published in 1995 - years before the potential effects of climate change had transformed public perceptions. Yet even today, after all the millions of words that have been written on the subject of climate change, we seem no closer to establishing that \"structure of control\". Indeed, Jennings's observation that the problem is mainly to be solved by legal means might now seem not so much trite as unorthodox, bold or even eccentric.</p> <p>The potential effects of climate change and the urgency of efforts to tackle it have been given a new focus by recent developments, including reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Nicholas Stern on behalf of the UK government. Although few deny the necessity of finding solutions, even fewer have any to hand. International summit statements only confirm the diplomatic efforts involved in attaining any kind of consensus.</p> <p>The understandable reluctance of developing countries to sign up to carbon commitments - unless the developed world is prepared to make an equitable contribution - calls for more radical options. Those options must be realised at state, regional and international levels, and they will require political, economic and legal solutions.</p> <p>In this mix, international legal instruments are crucial. The existing tools lack the necessary jurisdiction, clout and transparency. The time is ripe for a serious consideration of an international court for the environment. Such a court was mooted in Washington in 1999, but sank without trace. Today, however, we cannot afford to drop the ball.</p> <p>Ideally, such a court would be compulsory and would include a convention on the right to a healthy environment and deliver transparency in access to data and in its proceedings. It would include a scientific body to assess technical issues and a mechanism to avoid \"forum shopping\" - that is, litigants taking their pick of the most propitious court available.</p> <p>Of course, regulations and sanctions alone cannot deliver a global solution to problems of climate change, but without such components the incentive for individual countries to address those problems - and to achieve solutions that are politically acceptable within their own jurisdictions - will be much reduced.</p> <p>As far as the business community is concerned, an international court for the environment would offer a centralised system accessible to a range of actors, an enhanced body of law regarding environmental issues, and consistency in judicial resolution of environmental disputes. Such a court would also bring an increased focus on preventative measures, a set of global standards of care, and the facilitation and enforcement of environmental treaties. In addition, it could persuade the world business community to develop risk-management systems and improve present practices, thereby reducing the likelihood of environmental catastrophe.</p> <p>Only an impartial adjudicating body is capable of providing the catalyst for a global consensus as to the fairest way to distribute the burdens that accompany solutions to the climate change problem. Whatever difficulties may lie in the path of such solutions, the benefits will be greater.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Stephen Hockman QC is a former chairman of the Bar Council; a symposium on an international court of the environment is to be held in London in November <br><a href=\"http://www.clientearth.org \">clientearth.org </a><br><a href=\"mailto:stephenhockmanqc@6pumpcourt.co.uk\">stephenhockmanqc@6pumpcourt.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<h2>How does Chris Hoy find trousers to fit him when he's not cycling?</h2> <p>With great difficulty, we presume. Look at those thighs. They're incredible. If ever a pair of legs deserved their own postcode ... </p> <p>Someone who works at the British Cycling Federation (not in an official capacity) says, gamely: \"I'm sure that buying trousers is a problem that the sprinters have, because they do have very well-developed legs, to put it mildly, and I'm sure some of the slimmer-line styles wouldn't fit them. \"The two guys who really stand out as being likely to have trouser problems are Chris and Jamie Staff. I would imagine Jamie Staff has major trouser problems. They've both got a very, very well-developed muscle mass.\" Yes, yes, but what do they wear? \"I see Chris and Jamie around the office, and they wear quite normal jeans and things like that - I just think that they would probably struggle with some of the fashion-type trousers. If you see the legs close to they are incredibly impressive. I'm sure that a tailor would be extremely shocked\". <br><strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>Why are Caribbean sprinters so good? </h2> <p>If the father of Usain Bolt, who smashed the 100m world record in winning gold on Sunday, is to believed, it's because of the local food speciailites. \"It is definitely the Trelawny yam,\" Wellesley Bolt said by way of explanation after his son's success. Backing him up, the women's 100m winner Shelly-Ann Fraser said of the Jamaican clean sweep: \"A lot of yam, banana and dumplings produce top three!\"</p> <p>Six of the eight starters in the men's 100m final, and the first two across the line, were from the Caribbean; all three medallists in the women's event were from Jamaica. The region's proximity to the US helps - the best athletes are spotted and offered scholarships to top colleges there, where there is excellent coaching. But it is also becoming more common for some to stay in the Caribbean, with the sport massively popular and standards of coaching and facilities growing rapidly. Some say that the Caribbean's traditionally strict upbringing instils a sense of the required discipline - Jamaican Asafa Powell, former world-record holder, is the son of two pastors, and says that his focus is down to his childhood: \"I couldn't miss one day in church and my mom and dad still call to see if I'm going to church.\" Running is big in the Caribbean; the weather is good; and sprint champions are revered. But the main reason for Jamaicans' success, according to Fitz Coleman, a technical coach on Bolt's team, is the attitude. \"We genuinely believe that we'll conquer,\" he says. \"It's a mindset. We're small and we're poor, but we believe in ourselves.\" <br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>When did \"to medal\" become a verb?</h2> <p>It is tempting to say about a week ago - this ear-grating usage, as in \"Romero is the only British woman to medal in two different sports\", has disfigured the Beijing games - but, annoyingly, some dictionaries do accept \"medal\" as a verb, meaning \"to decorate or honour with a medal\" or \"to receive a medal, esp. in a sporting event\". It is, however, clearly an ugly Americanism - the earliest identified use of the word meaning to win a medal dates from 1966, in California, and the Washington Post was using it by 1979 - which needs to be stamped out. The sooner medal-obsessed Americans stop meddling with the English language the better. <br><strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>Whatever happened to the British love of heroic but buffoonish failures?</h2> <p>Once we could laugh at ourselves. Eddie \"the Eagle\" Edwards became a superstar for being the world's worst ski-jumper (or, as the Italians preferred, \"ski-dropper\"). But eventually the litany of failure - in cricket, football, athletics, more or less everything, really - got to us. Steve McClaren and his brolly seem to have been the last straw. Now, we don't even send no-hopers to the games, lest the \"Team GB\" brand be tarnished.</p> <p>How dull! Eddie the Eagle soared to become a global phenomenon. He made a disc, Fly Eddie Fly, which reached the top 50 in the UK, and repeated that success in Finland with Mun Nimeni On Eetu (My name is Eetu), despite not speaking a word of Finnish. What price Bradley Wiggins enjoying chart success with a disc called Go Bradley Go, let alone becoming a disco sensation in Helsinki? Failure is always more interesting - and more entertaining - than success. <br><strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>Is it unseemly to cry when you get silver?</h2> <p>There are two ways to see winning Olympic silver. You are either the amazingly accomplished second-best sprinter, shot-putter, diver, tennis player, small-bore rifle (prone position) shooter in the world, or you are a USELESS FAILURE, a HOPELESS LOSER. \"Second is nowhere,\" as the sports psychologists like to say.</p> <p>Traditionally, Americans have taken the latter attitude. They expect to win, so second is a defeat. Close but no cigar. Michael Phelps wouldn't have been allowed back into the country if he'd won eight silvers. China is taking the same hard line: when one of its competitors in the shooting last week managed only a bronze, a TV interviewer rounded on him, demanding to know where it had all gone wrong. But other, more accommodating countries - us, for instance, or Belgium - have been less embarrassed about celebrating silvers and bronzes. Well done, jolly good show, marvellous effort.</p> <p>Now, all that is changing. Katherine Grainger, the senior member of the women's quadruple scull, burst into tears after she won silver - admittedly her third in successive games. Nothing but gold would do for Grainger or the rest of the sobbing crew. </p> <p>\"I feel so empty,\" said one. This is a worrying development. What on earth would they have done if they'd come last, or not even made the final, or sank? Save the tears for a real disaster, and be thankful you didn't come 23rd, like Paula. <br><strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>Do chicken nuggets make you run faster?</h2> <p>If Usain Bolt's example is anything to go by, when it comes to sporting performance, chicken nuggets are the new superfood. On the day that Bolt broke his own world record in the 100m sprint, taking the race in 9.69 seconds (having glanced around many metres before the end, clocked his lead and thumped his chest happily) chicken nuggets were his sole source of energy. \"I never had breakfast,' he said afterwards. \"I woke up around 11, I watched television, and then I had some [chicken] nuggets for lunch. I went back to my room, I slept for two hours, I went back for some more nuggets and came to the track.\"</p> <p>So can chicken nuggets make us all run faster? \"I suppose it depends what you do with them,\" says Ron Maughan, professor of sport and exercise nutrition at the University of Loughborough. \"Assuming you eat them, it's highly unlikely that they'll help.\" The problem is that while nuggets can be a reasonable source of protein, which is good, they also tend to have a reasonable amount of fat. When it comes to developing as a sprinter, Maughan suggests that you're probably better off eating lean chicken-breast sandwiches during your training periods.<br><strong> KC</strong></p> <h2>Why are we so good at sailing, rowing and cycling, but useless at track and field?</h2> <p>The Australians like to joke that we Brits are good at sitting-down sports. Unfortunately, they're right. The 3,000m steeplechase, the pole vault, weightlifting, not a hope. But give us a seat on a bike, in a boat or on a horse and we're potential world-beaters.</p> <p>Part of the reason may be our innate laziness - the weather in the UK is bad and we spend most of our time indoors watching TV or playing online Scrabble - but the real key is the number of countries that participate in each sport. In three-day eventing, at which we are traditionally strong (and where we usually manage to find a member of the royal family able to compete), there are just 75 competitors. In athletics there are 2,000. To succeed in eventing you would need a fantastic horse, probably worth \u00a3250,000 or more, and the means to transport it to Beijing; in athletics you need a strong pair of lungs. Ethiopia, Morocco and Kenya are very good at athletics, but they are absolute crap at three-day eventing.</p> <p>The key to winning medals at the Olympics is to think small. Don't target sports that everyone can be good at - athletics, boxing, football. Go for technologically complicated and expensive sports that hardly anyone can afford, such as yachting. Or, better still, sports that are both mind-blowingly dull and need expensive facilities, such as cycling and rowing. Britain should press for formula one motor racing to be included in 2012. Then let's see Jamaica find someone to rival Lewis Hamilton and his McLaren. <strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>Just how weird is Rebecca Romero? </h2> <p>Anyone who watched Romero being interviewed in the velodrome at the weekend, just after she'd steamed to gold in the women's individual pursuit race, might be moved to suggest that she is very weird indeed. In a good way, of course. While other athletes spend their post-race interviews simply glorying in their success, Romero retained an almost superhuman intensity. \"If I hadn't done it today, I don't know where I would be,\" she said, before adding, in the most ominous declaration of this or any games, \"probably on the floor, dead somewhere\".</p> <p>OK then. The national women's cycling coach, Dan Hunt, has said that Romero's ability to push her body through the pain barrier is \"astonishing\", while Dave Brailsford, performance director of British Cycling, has commented that \"in terms of being able to hurt yourself ... boy, oh boy!\" And it is this awesome commitment that has enabled Romero to become the only British woman ever to compete in two different sports at an Olympic Games - at Athens in 2004 she won silver in the women's quadruple sculls. \"Winning gold was like D-day,\" Romero said after the race. \"I had to face my demons, grit my teeth, and ride the best race of my life. And I did it.\" Terrifying. <br><strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>But is Romero as weird as Michael Phelps? </h2> <p>Well, that's debatable. The athlete known by his teammates as Squid Boy, by others as Superfish, and by one of his Russian rivals as \"a normal bloke from another planet\", is not quite like anyone else on Earth - no one but Michael Fred Phelps has won 14 Olympic gold medals, including eight in the past week. Physically, he is, in some ways, not so far outside the norm - at 6ft 4in he is actually a few inches shorter than fellow American Tom Malchow, the previous world record holder in the 200m butterfly, and his 6ft 7in arm span is considerably smaller than the gargantuan 7ft 5in reach of the 1980s German swimmer, Michael Gross.</p> <p>In every other way, Phelps is remarkable to the point of weirdness. He eats 12,000 calories a day - and manages to burn them all off. He has double-jointed ankles, knees and elbows. He swims more than 100km a week, and trains every day of the week, every day of the year, including Christmas Day. His coach, Bob Bowman, has said that he sometimes has to \"physically shake\" Phelps to break his pre-race trance. As one sports writer said: \"Phelps can manipulate water like no human since Moses.\" </p> <p>He is very weird indeed. Stunningly, astonishingly, fantastically weird. <br><strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>And how normal is Rebecca Adlington?</h2> <p>If Romero and Phelps come across as somewhat bizarre, British swimmer Rebecca Adlington is almost jaw-droppingly normal. Sure, in terms of her achievements, she's outstanding. She is the first British woman ever to win two swimming gold medals, and the first British female Olympic champion in the pool since 1960. She has also sliced a significant 2.12 seconds off the 800m freestyle record, which was set way back in 1989.</p> <p>Before breaking that record though, she admits that she had to lie on the floor to avoid \"standing up and being sick, because I was more nervous than I've ever been in my life\". When told that the press had been poking fun at her Mansfield home town, she retorted that \"we've lived there all my life, we love living there, and we wouldn't ever move\", and on the subject of rewards, she's said that she won't accept any endorsements that get in the way of her swimming. </p> <p>Far from putting on an aura of steely sophistication, Adlington has admitted to being \"scared of the sea. I'm absolutely petrified. It's the unknown. I can't stand fish\". And in reflecting on the games, she commented that: \"He [Phelps] is so amazing. I'm just glad that I've done what I've done at a games with him, so I get to tell my grandchildren that I was there when Michael Phelps got his eight gold medals.\" Which may be about the most modest sentence you'll ever hear from an Olympian. <br><strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>Doesn't it all make you proud to be British?</h2> <p>No, in a nutshell. Of course it's jolly nice that our sailors, rowers and cyclists are doing well, that \"Dame\" Rebecca Adlington has proved that we can swim, and that Louis Smith's bronze - our first gymnastics medal since 776BC - has given the lie to accusations that we are all lazy, obese couch potatoes who always got a note from our mothers to get out of doing gym at school.</p> <p>But all this \"Proud to be British\", \"Will the Olympics rescue Gordon?\", \"Putting the Great Back into Britain\" stuff is nonsense. To paraphrase Dr Johnson, sporting patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel. Think bread and circuses, Hitler at the Berlin games in 1936, East Germany's obsession with its medal tally and willingness to go to any drug-induced lengths to boost it. If sporting achievement is really the litmus test of whether a country is any good, it's a fair bet that it's an extremely dodgy, recession-threatened, knife crime-haunted, educationally chaotic, politically neutered country. Also in my view. <br><strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>How does the medals table work?</h2> <p>Well, that all depends. Go to the official Olympic website and you'll find China top by virtue of winning 36 golds, 17 more than anyone else. Here, one gold is more valuable than any number of other colours - Tunisia, with a single gold medal but nothing else, sit happily above Belarus, who have three silvers and seven bronzes. Over on the official American Olympic website, however, the US are top because they have won a total of 65 medals of any colour, two more than China. Last month Georg Dutlik, head of the EU commission in Vienna, said that all of the European Union's medals should count as one, in which case we'd be top whatever way you look at it. The Americans think we're fifth at the moment, the Chinese reckon we're third. I like them the best. <br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>Does anyone understand the rules in the velodrome?</h2> <p>To the uninitiated - and let's be honest, we were all uninitiated until a few days ago - the cycling is impenetrable. Cyclists in absurd headgear and body-hugging Lycra suits go round and round a wall of death in a variety of events that seem to bear no resemblance to a race. In the keirin, a man on a motorbike even takes part. No prizes, you might think, for guessing who will win. In the \"sprint\", riders seem to compete to see who can go slowest, and only with great difficulty do they manage to stay on their bikes. As for the points race, Nasa scientists are still trying to find the formula by which the medals are awarded. </p> <p>The official games website offers a rather dry explanation of each of the events, including the sinister-sounding madison, but it's a bit like describing a spiral staircase. You really have to see it. Even after reading the detailed exegesis, the points race remains elusive: how come riders who get a lap ahead, apparently the objective, are then placed at the back to ensure they do badly in the sprint that takes place every eighth lap? At least it is made clear that the curious man on the motorbike is only there for show. He drops out near the end, having demonstrated that none of the cyclists can overtake him.</p> <p>But who cares about the rules? We're winning all the medals. And the great news is that Ken Livingstone has volunteered to ride the motorbike (a low-emission one of course) in 2012. <br><strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>What do the Olympians do in the evenings?</h2> <p>You'd think that after all that exertion and pressure, athletes might find time for some more relaxed physical jerks after dark. Of the 100,000 condoms available to competitors at the start of the games, though, only a third have been used so far - a big change of pace from the Sydney games in 2000, known as the Shaglympics, during which the organisers ran out of prophylactics and had to rush to the chemist for more. There are two explanations. One, no one's getting any; two, they're doing it without protection. Let's hope the former. Still, others are finding pleasure in entirely non-physical pursuits. Rafael Nadal was recently spotted using an evening off to do his laundry. Well, those shorts won't wash themselves. <strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>Where has the green line gone? </h2> <p>Coverage of the swimming featured a helpful green line that whisked its way up and down the pool at world-record pace, so everyone could see by precisely what unlikely margin it was about to be broken. But it has disappeared for the athletics, which is a bit of a shame. A BBC spokeswoman explained that the line had been added by the host broadcasters, but her technical people said swimming was \"very two-dimensional\" while athletics features an unhelpful \"bend\", so don't expect to see it again any time soon.<br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>What is Yngling and how do you pronounce it?</h2> <p>Yngling is a type of keelboat, and easily the silliest of the 23 varieties of keelboat currently accredited by the International Sailing Federation, most of which sound like cast members of the Gladiators - Tempest, Lightning, Dragon, Melges 24. OK, the last one doesn't sound like a Gladiator. Its Norwegian inventor designed it for his son in 1967 and named it Yngling, Norwegian for young man. This is its second appearance in the Olympics, where it is raced only by women - the men's keelboat is the more gladiatorial Star. A spokeswoman from the Norwegian embassy says the word \"is slightly old-fashioned now\" but confirms that it is pronounced erngling, with the initial Y sounding like a German U with an umlaut. \"It's not really a word we use a lot,\" says a colleague. <br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>Is John Major responsible for team GB's success?</h2> <p>Some are claiming that because John Major was prime minister when the national lottery was launched, and the lottery now funds many of Britain's successful athletes, the cricket-loving trapeze-artist's son is responsible for our place in the medal table. </p> <p>Britain would almost certainly be much less successful were our best athletes not given some money, but key coaching appointments - J\u00fcrgen Gr\u00f6bler in rowing and Bill Sweetenham in swimming, for example - have been just as influential. Besides, the lottery awards funding based on how well each sport does. So if you could only do well by getting lottery money, and the only way to get lottery money was to do well, the nation's sportsmen would be sent into such a tailspin of bewildering logical conundrums that they would hardly be able to run/row/pedal/swim/sail at all.<br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>Why were there so many records broken in the pool?</h2> <p>At the Water Cube last week possible answers to this conundrum were being created and destroyed again almost as regularly as world records. Several technical possibilities have been suggested - the pool is both wider - it has 10 rather than eight lanes - and deeper - by about 3ft - than average, stopping nasty, distracting waves from bouncing around the place, while the plastic lane-dividers provide an extra calming effect. However, even the pool's designer, Sydney-based John Bilmon, says most of this is nothing new and believes, somewhat self-servingly, that athletes have simply been inspired by the beauty of his building. In all, 25 world records were broken in 32 events - not bad, but when the nation's athletes are better prepared than ever before and are all focused on peaking for this one event, not a total surprise. </p> <p>And then there's the outfits ... <br><strong> SB</strong></p> <h2>Can special clothes really make you faster?</h2> <p>Behind Britain's brilliant cycling squad is a team of nerds, known as the Secret Squirrel Club, who do nothing but refine their apparel. These boffins have spent the past four years hunched in their laboratories to create a \u00a310,000 superbike, designed with assistance from arms manufacturer BAE Systems. Nothing was left to chance; at one point the squirrels spent several days in a wind tunnel testing the aerodynamic efficiency of a variety of wheel spokes. It seems to have worked out quite well. It's not just them, though - everything in Beijing is better, faster, lighter. The latest gymnastics shoes weigh just 10g, about the same as a \u00a31 coin. Athletes have shoes designed to help them round bends. In the pool, 94% of the gold-medallists and 23 of the 25 world record-breakers were wearing Speedo's new Fastskin LZR Racer skinsuit, called \"technological doping\" by a jealous bloke who wasn't allowed to wear one and didn't swim very fast. It all helps, but then Phelps also thrashed the 200m butterfly world record with his eyes blinded by leaky goggles. Some of these guys would probably be pretty fast dressed as a pantomime cow. <br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>Do some countries not care about the Olympics?</h2> <p>Brunei doesn't seem to care much. It forgot to register its two athletes, was disqualified and is the only country not taking part. Even Tuvalu is represented, presumably in the swimming. One might think, given their abysmal showing, that all the countries of South America don't care, but they do. It's just that they're too poor to develop the facilities needed to compete with the Olympics-obsessed countries of Europe, North America and Asia. The games are being followed with interest in South America, even though the medals won thus far by countries in the region have been paltry.</p> <h2>Should we feel sorry for Paula Radcliffe?</h2> <p>The quadrennial Paula debacle has provoked mixed reactions. In the Guardian, kindly Richard Williams called her attempt to win in Beijing, despite being underprepared after a leg injury, heroic. Jeff Powell, in the Daily Mail, was less forgiving, labelling her a \"drama queen\", and complaining that the race was all about her 23rd place rather than fellow Brit Mara Yamauchi's record-equalling sixth place.</p> <p>The fans on her website had better not get hold of Powell. They can barely contain their emotion. \"If medals were given out for sheer guts, Paula would win gold,\" says one. \"I'm so proud of her. She's an inspiration. She showed the true meaning of the Olympics and should now be a contender for SPOTY.\" But should she? SPOTY here means Sports Personality of the Year, but the only prize Paula is likely to win is Silly PR-conscious Optimist of the Year. She was unfit; everyone knew that; Team GB had a reserve, Hayley Haining, who was in shape and could have run in Beijing. Paula's participation, while great theatre, was dumb sport. In my view. <br><strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>Is hyperactivity a boon if you're an Olympian?</h2> <p>It seems to be. In fact, if this games has taught us anything, it's that hyperactive kids can be high achievers. Louis Smith, for instance. The British gymnast was considered a handful at school, and channeled his energy at Huntingdon Gymnastics Club, where out-of-control boys were disciplined with 200 circles on the pommel horse. The punishment certainly paid off - at the weekend, Smith won bronze in the men's pommel horse event, becoming the first British male to win a gymnastics medal in 80 years.</p> <p>And then, of course, there's Michael Phelps, who was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as a kid, and briefly put on medication. His mother Debbie has said that when he was in kindergarten, \"I was told by his teacher, 'Michael can't sit still, Michael can't be quiet, Michael can't focus.' I said, 'maybe he's bored.' The teacher said, 'He's not gifted. Your son will never be able to focus on anything.'\" And to that teacher must go the gold for least accurate prediction, ever. <br><strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>Who are all these commentators? </h2> <p>We're used to having the same, familiar voices providing the soundtrack for major sporting events, but this is different. Where are John Motson and Peter Alliss? Who are Garry Herbert and Matthew Syed? It seems the days of the versatile jobbing commentator are almost over - now everyone has to be a former Olympic medalist. At the diving, Leon Taylor; at the judo, Nicola Fairbrother; at the hockey, Sean Kerly; at the weightlifting ... OK, we don't have a former Olympic medallist in that so we get a jobbing commentator. On the plus side, they know a lot about their sport. On the down side, they keep going on about stroke rates and their voices go squeaky at important moments. Also, shouldn't there be a clause about not interviewing athletes while they are both a) panting and b) weeping? Putting your arm on their shoulder and telling them to \"take your time\" DOES NOT MAKE IT OK. <br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>Do men and women have equal opportunities in the games?</h2> <p>The Olympic playing field for men and women has levelled considerably in the past few decades, with women's football being introduced in 1996, for instance, weightlifting in 2000, and wrestling in 2004. There are still some areas where women aren't allowed to compete, though; specifically, boxing in the summer games, and ski-jumping in the winter games. And the overall number of events for women is far lower - while men have 12 canoe-kayak races to compete in, for example, women have only four. In fact, the disparity is so marked, that there are only 127 gold medals available to women in Beijing, compared with 165 gold medals for men. </p> <p>Gold-winning British cyclist Nicole Cooke, spoke out about this state of affairs after winning the first of Britain's gold medals last week in the road race. \"I think the biggest thing to address,\" said Cooke, \"is the inequality of cycling medals between the sexes\"; a reference to the fact that, while men can compete in seven events in the velodrome, there are only three women's events. (And Briton Victoria Pendleton might well have won them all.)</p> <p>According to the International Cycling Union, the reason for this is \"historical\" - which presumably also explains the disparity between the number of male and female events available in sports including rowing, weightlifting and wrestling. Harriet Foxwell, of the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation, hopes that in 2012 there will be \"a more equal playing field: there should be the same number of medals for women as men, all sports should be contested by both sexes, half the volunteers should be women and there should be a dramatic increase in the number of female coaches\". <br><strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>Why are we called \"Team GB\"?</h2> <p>Mainly because it is considerably easier on the tongue than \"the Great Britain Olympics Team\", according to the woman behind the brand, Marzena Bogdanowicz. \"I think I had the idea in 1996 or 1997,\" says the BOA's then director of marketing. \"I went to the games in 1996 and the logo at the time was just the lion and the rings, but we weren't strong enough as a brand to just be a lion and the rings. So coming back I wanted to find something that was less of a mouthful, and also had that team feel. We looked at the options and came up with Team GB.\" The result didn't just look good on T-shirts, it also inspires Britain's best. \"Come Sydney 2000 we had Team GB everywhere,\" Bogdanowicz says. \"When the athletes arrived, they saw that and they knew they were part of a bigger team, not just a group of athletes or swimmers. That had a positive effect on everyone.\" The statistics back her up: in the last games before she got to work we won one gold medal. So far in Beijing we have won 12. <br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>Where's the smog gone?</h2> <p>In the past week, the high level of concern about Beijing's air quality has proved largely unfounded. The removal of 300,000 high-polluting vehicles from the city's streets since July 1 - a measure that will last until the end of the Paralympics - has apparently made a huge difference, as have the meteorological conditions, including a series of downpours that have helped clear the smog. <br><strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>Have we peaked too soon before 2012? </h2> <p>Team GB headed to Beijing with a target of 41 gold medals, which means we have another 14 still to come. The idea was to finish eighth in the final medal table here, and fourth in four years' time, but at this rate we'll have used up our entire supply of excitement about cycling by then, while Tom Daley will be a considerably-less-cute-than-14 18. But fret not - the chances are that we will improve on this performance when the circus comes to London, if only because the entry requirements for the host nation are so relaxed that we'll have far more competitors and some of them are bound to get lucky. So put that \"I heart Yngling T-shirt\" somewhere safe - you haven't finished with it yet. <br><strong>SB </strong></p>",
  "<p>The Bird's Nest Stadium is anticipating the best track event of these Games this evening when Christine Ohuruogu takes on Sanya Richards in the 400m final and attempts to become the first British woman to strike Olympic gold at this event. It pits the world champion from Osaka last summer, who has never failed to win gold in championship finals, against the world No1, who has never won an individual championship gold.</p> <p>If the qualifying rounds are any guide, Richards has the edge in form. Ohuruogu's usual routine is quick-slow-quick but, if she adopts those tactics in this race, by the time she launches her trademark final surge, it will be too late. Richards has powered into the final with the best times of the rounds. In the heats she pushed hard from the start and in the semi-final she began more slowly but kicked on.</p> <p>For all that Ohuruogu looked strong, it is Richards' deadly power between 150 and 300 metres, where she wins so many races, that is impressive.</p> <p>In Stockholm last month one of the best fields in Europe could not cope with Richards when she ran that way. But this is not a grand prix and Richards, 23, despite being the quickest 400m runner of her generation - she has a personal best of 48.70sec compared with Ohuruogu's 49.61 - has not won an individual global title.</p> <p>Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec, who won the 400m title in Atlanta in 1992 and 1996 but failed to defend it in Sydney 2000 when she withdrew blaming the stress of the publicity surrounding her rivalry with Cathy Freeman, the Australian who succeeded her as champion, believes Ohuruogu will not be able to hold Richards tonight. </p> <p>\"I do not think Christine will beat her,\" said the Frenchwoman. \"Christine is having the same season as last year, she looked good in the last 100m [of her semi]. But Sanya is running differently each time, so you do not know how to dance with her.\"</p> <p>But Ohuruogu will be the more determined to succeed because, when she left Osaka, she did not even know if she would be in Beijing because an Olympic appeal against her drugs ban lay ahead. She won that and hopes that decision will be vindicated tonight when she aims to go one better than Ann Packer in 1964 and Lillian Board in 1968.</p> <p>To do that, though, she will have to reverse her recent losing run against Richards. Although the American failed to make the 400m team for Osaka because of the after-effects of illness, she returned to beat Ohuruogu in Zurich, Berlin and Stuttgart on the way to scooping \u00a3250,000 as a winner of the Golden League.</p> <p>In all those races she powered away from the gun. Now she is ready to increase the speed again. \"Coach [Clyde] Hart told me whatever I needed to run, don't worry about it,\" said Richards. \"I am ready and I am strong. I thought in my mind I might run 49 [in the semi] but I wasn't sure, so I was happy to see 49.90. I'm close to seeing 48.\"</p> <p>But Ohuruogu, 24, the Londoner who came back from a year's suspension for missing three drugs tests to win in Japan, is not concerned. \"The way I run, the way I train, I never look at times,\" she said. \"My coach says running 400m is not about who is the fastest, who is the strongest. It's about who has the most will to get to the line first.</p> <p>\"We were pretty much working in the dark last year, what with the ban and injury, we put on a session and the programme worked. Now we have had a lot more time, we have planned our year properly. It's an interesting thing pressure, but it's only pressure if you allow it to be.

  "<p>Great Britain's Olympians found themselves looking down on most of the sporting world last night after another remarkable day of achievement in China elevated Team GB to the unaccustomed heights of third in the overall medal table. Only the superpowers of the US and China stood above them last night, and below lie traditionally more powerful rivals such as Australia, Germany and France.</p> <p>After a record-breaking weekend saw British athletes sweeping up medals like Olympic tourists collect badges, yesterday saw perhaps the most significant medal of all captured in the Laoshin velodrome, scene of many of the team's greatest triumphs in the last nine days.</p> <p>When five-time Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins led the men's pursuit team to victory on the boards, Great Britain had their 12th gold medal of the games, taking the total to 27 and in effect meeting the overall team target a week before the flame goes out in Beijing.</p> <p>Before the team left for China, UK Sport, the body that distributes funding to elite sport, set the team a target of eighth in the medal table. They calculated that it would take 12 gold medals to do so, with a total haul of 35-41. </p> <p>Yesterday the team delivered early, and with power to add in sailing, cycling and athletics today, expectations are rising that the team could ultimately finish as high as fifth in the overall standings.</p> <p>The secret of Britain's unprecedented success has been the ability of three core sports - cycling, rowing and sailing - to deliver close to their maximum medal potential. Last night they had contributed 17 of Britain's 27 medals, and 10 of the 12 golds.</p> <p>The three sports have long been the bedrock of British Olympic teams but this year, a decade after national lottery funding was first directed to Olympic sports, they have excelled even their own high standards.</p> <p>\"The 'formula one' sports have proved that attention to detail, improved funding and total commitment to professionalism at every stage brings world dominance,\" said Lord Moynihan, chairman of the British Olympic Association, yesterday. \"The mind-set of these teams now is that an athlete finishes with a silver and you can see that they are gutted. That is new, and sums up the desire within this team.\"</p> <p>All three are highly technical sports that have seen investment in technology, sports science and equipment deliver returns. With highly skilled coaches, an unsentimental approach to selection and efficient talent identification systems they have delivered their best-ever performances in China. There is no better example than the cyclists, who have thus far secured six gold medals, five of them in the velodrome, and could win three more golds today. With three silver medals and two bronze, they have contributed 40% of Britain's total medal haul.</p> <p>The contrast with Athens, where the team won a total of 30 medals and nine golds to finish 10th overall, is instructive. In Greece the cycling team won four medals, two gold, one silver and one bronze. Insert those results into the 2008 medal table and Great Britain would be in 10th place. Instead, all 14 of the track team could well return home with a medal. The secret has been a relentless focus on detail, from the bikes they ride to their aerodynamic over-socks.The sailors have also pushed the boundaries of their discipline in the 12 years since the Atlanta games, at which they won just two silver medals, and had collected two golds already in Beijing before Nick Rogers and Joe Glanfield added a silver in the 470 class yesterday.</p> <p>The Royal Yachting Association established a high-performance programme after Atlanta that was ahead of its time and has shown the same commitment as cycling to improvement. </p> <p>Lottery funding has been central to the effort, with a crew costing as much as \u00a3260,000 to keep on the water in Olympic year. The sailors carry out extensive research on all the venues at which they race, conducting more than a year of weather analysis at the Olympic sailing venue in Qindao before the games. They have also fostered a hugely competitive environment in which one Olympic champion, 2004 yngling skipper Shirley Robertson, was jettisoned to improve the boat. That decision was justified when the crew, including new recruit Pippa Wilson, retained the title on Saturday.</p> <p>Rowing has also enjoyed its most successful regatta in Olympic history, with two gold, silver and bronze medals captured at the weekend. Oarsmen and women have been conspicuous beneficiaries of lottery funding, with a purpose-built lake at Caversham, near Reading, providing a centre of excellence for both men's and women's elite squads. They have also harnessed the great tradition in the sport established by Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Matthew Pinsent, who won nine gold medals between them and act as mentors to the new generation. </p> <p>Selection in rowing has been particularly ruthless, with the women's team required to race head-to-head all winter to determine the strongest, fastest athletes, with the result that they delivered their best haul of one silver and a bronze, both of which could have been gold in different circumstances.</p> <p>There have been more isolated successes in other sports too, notably Rebecca Adlington's two gold medals in the pool. Swimming has underperformed for two decades, but a talent identification program and work ethic introduced under controversial former coach Bill Sweetenham may now be producing dividends. </p> <p>If Team GB is to improve in London in four years' time, when the BOA wants to finish fourth in the table, the load will have to be shared more evenly, and the government will have to deliver on its promise to increase the funding that has made the results possible. The three core sports will struggle to better their Beijing performances and other sports, most notably track and field athletics, will have to deliver major improvements.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bhpbilliton\">BHP Billiton</a> today played down fears that the boom which has driven <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/commodities\">commodity prices</a> to record levels could turn to bust as global growth slows.</p> <p>The world's biggest mining group, involved in a $130bn (\u00a370bn) hostile bid for rival <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/riotinto\">Rio Tinto</a>, said it expected demand from developing countries, led by China and India, to offset the impact of weakening demand from developed economies. Commodity prices enjoyed their best run for 35 years in the first half of 2008, according to the Reuters/Jefferies CRB index, but fell 10% in July.</p> <p>Some analysts have argued that slowing demand from the US and western Europe will feed through to developing economies by reducing demand for their exports. Chief executive Marius Kloppers said today that such a view overestimated the importance of exports to the balance of the Chinese economy. </p> <p>\"We have always said that China is not an export-led economy. It is driven by domestic demand ... We think the supply side is going to have a harder time keeping up [with demand] than people think.\" </p> <p>BHP said that in the year to the end of June, revenue rose by more than a quarter to $59.5bn while profit from operations climbed about 22% to $24bn. The company underlined its confidence by increasing the dividend for the year by almost 50% to 70 cents a share.</p> <p>\"Our results were outstanding in the context of a challenging supply environment which was characterised by unexpected disruptions, rising input prices, skills shortages and the further devaluation of the US dollar,\" the company said in a statement.</p> <p>Kloppers said that six months ago he had expressed the view that commodity prices would remain resilient and \"that view has not much changed\".</p> <p>BHP has a broad range of commodities, spanning petroleum, aluminium, base metals, iron ore and manganese to coal and diamonds. </p> <p>\"I think there is a difference between those [commodities] more leveraged to the emerging economies and those more leveraged to the developed economies,\" he said. </p> <p>Consumption of aluminium, which Kloppers said is called the middle-class metal because it is heavily used in packaging, fridges and beverage cans, was much more linked to developed economies. Coking coal and iron ore were tied to developing economies where demand was more likely, on average, to be stronger.</p> <p>BHP said that in the short term it expected commodity prices \"to remain high relative to historical levels, albeit with higher volatility\".</p> <p>Although commodity prices increased strongly over the second half of the group's financial year, BHP said its costs had risen sharply, with higher charges for diesel, coke and explosives adding to the burden of labour shortages.</p> <p>Kloppers said that, unlike a number of its peers, BHP had increased its volume by 7% over the year and was looking for further growth in the current period. He noted supply remained constrained by the length of time needed to bring new projects on stream because of bottlenecks within the industry.</p> <p>The company's confidence was generally well received. Its shares rose 8p to \u00a315.37 with stocks across the sector getting a boost from BHP's upbeat tone. </p> <p>Matthew Kidman, head of investment at Wilson Asset Management, said: \"The outlook still looks good even though there may be some impact over the next six months from the weakness in western economies. BHP doesn't appear to be too worried, because of the ongoing demand coming from China's industrialisation.\"</p> <p>BHP's bid for Rio Tinto is being vetted by the European commission's competition authorities, which are expected to rule on the matter towards the end of the year. If successful, it would be the world's second-largest takeover, behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/vodafonegroup\">Vodafone</a>'s acquisition of Mannesmann in 2000.</p>",
  "<p>Russian forces were today seen strengthening their positions in the city of Gori, despite assurances that they had started to withdraw troops from Georgia under a French-brokered peace plan.</p> <p>\"The pull-out of peacekeeping forces started today,\" Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, the deputy chief of staff of Russia's military, told a daily official briefing in Moscow.</p> <p>However in Gori, 55 miles west of the capital, Tbilisi, Russian forces showed no sign of leaving and appeared to be digging in. The only movement seen by Associated Press reporters was in the opposite direction from Russia \u2014 toward the Georgian capital of Tbilisi.</p> <p>In the afternoon, four Russian armoured personnel carriers, each carrying about 15 men, went from Gori to Igoeti, a crossroads town even closer to Tbilisi. Passing some Georgian soldiers sitting by the roadside, the Russians moved into Igoeti then turned off onto a side road.</p> <p>The US has called an emergency meeting of Nato for tomorrow to discuss the alliance's response to Russia and the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, is flying to Europe today for the event.</p> <p>Mikheil Saakashvili, the Georgian president, switched to a conciliatory tone, calling for talks after Moscow said it would withdraw troops. Saakashvili had previously denounced Russians as \"21st-century barbarians\" after they routed Georgian forces sent in to re-annex Georgia's breakaway province of South Ossetia.</p> <p>\"I appeal to you that after your armed forces leave Georgian territory, to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations, a further search for ways [to conduct] relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good,\" Saakashvili said.</p> <p>Russian forces are supposed to leave Georgian territory today under a truce brokered by the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. Western countries have warned the Kremlin of unspecified consequences unless it fulfils its pledge.</p> <p>Kakha Lomaia, the secretary of Georgia's national security council, said he saw no sign of a Russian pullout. \"The Russian general (Vyacheslav Borisov) promised last night to start the pullout at 10am, but so far there is no sign,\" he said on the main highway to Gori.</p> <p>Georgian television showed Russian forces moving out of the western Georgian town of Senaki, but it was not clear if this was part of the promised larger retreat. A six-point peace plan calls for a prompt withdrawal of Russian forces from Georgia proper - the areas outside South Ossetia and a second Russian-backed separatist province of Abkhazia - but the west will also be looking for Russian troops to cut back their numbers quickly in South Ossetia itself.</p> <p>As Georgia waited for Russian troops to leave, the leader of South Ossetia said he wanted Russia to put a military base on its territory and ruled out the return of international observers.</p> <p>\"We will ask the leadership of the Russian Federation for there to be a Russian military base on the territory of South Ossetia because Russian citizens live here,\" Eduard Kokoity, South Ossetia leader, told Reuters. \"We will ask the Russian leadership - it is their decision.\"</p> <p>Only Russia recognises South Ossetia, which broke away from Georgian rule in a 1991-92 war. Kokoity's comments underline South Ossetia's determination to move closer to Russia.</p> <p>Kokoity fired his government and declared a month-long emergency as he criticised his cabinet for not doing enough to help thousands of people who fled their homes during the fighting.</p> <p>\"I consider the government was not working effectively so I signed the decree [to sack it],\" he said. \"We have created an emergency commission to liquidate the consequences of the Georgian aggression. This is connected to the fact that several members of the government are incapable of acting in such a serious military situation.\"</p> <p>Nearly 100,000 people have been driven from their homes by the conflict, according to the UN refugee agency. The International Committee of the Red Cross has said up to half of South Ossetia's 70,000 people have fled.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch called for the urgent deployment of an EU mission of police and security forces.</p> <p>\"This conflict has been a disaster for civilians,\" said Rachel Denber, Europe and Central Asia deputy director at Human Rights Watch. \"An international security mission should be deployed to help protect civilians and create a safe environment for the displaced to return home. And international organisations should also send fact-finding missions to establish the facts, report on human rights, and urge the authorities to account for any crimes.\"</p> <p>The UN said a first aid convoy managed to reach the Georgian town of Gori near the border with South Ossetia yesterday, and while buildings did not appear to be very damaged there were \"clear signs of massive looting\".</p> <p>Russia says about 1,600 people were killed in the initial Georgian attack on the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali, a figure that has not been independently confirmed. Georgia accuses Russian and irregular forces of looting and burning Georgian villages around Tskhinvali.</p>",
  "<p>Silvio Berlusconi's government was today engaged in a vigorous damage limitation exercise after Pope Benedict appeared to lend his immense moral authority to speculation that Italy was in danger of returning to fascism under the tycoon's hardline, rightwing leadership.</p> <p>In his customary midday Sunday address, the pontiff expressed concern at \"recent examples of racism\" and reminded Catholics it was their duty to steer others in society away from \"racism, intolerance and [the] exclusion [of others]\".</p> <p>On any other day, his remarks might have been seen as no more than a restatement of official Catholic doctrine. But they came instead in the midst of a furious dispute over an editorial published by Italy's bestselling Catholic weekly, Famiglia Cristiana.</p> <p>In an editorial on Friday, condemning recent government moves against immigrants and Roma, the magazine said it was to be hoped fascism was not \"resurfacing in our country under another guise\". The jibe outraged Berlusconi's supporters, many of whom are themselves pious Catholics.</p> <p>The leader of his parliamentary group in the upper house, Maurizio Gasparri, announced he would personally sue the priest who is Famiglia Cristiana's editor while the junior minister with responsibility for family affairs, Carlo Giovanardi, said the magazine was \"possessed by ideological malice\". </p> <p>In an effort to calm the row, the Vatican's spokesman put out a statement stressing that Famiglia Cristiana was not authorised to speak on behalf of either the Holy See or the Italian bishops' conference - something which, as the magazine's editor noted, it had never anyway claimed to do.</p> <p>Coming against this background, the pope's comments were interpreted by Berlusconi's critics as a signal that the Vatican was not climbing down or distancing itself from Famiglia Cristiana's interpretation. </p> <p>Benedict cited in his address the story from Matthew's gospel of Jesus's encounter with a pagan woman and how he rose above his initial misgivings to perform a miracle for her daughter.</p> <p>The pope said: \"One of humanity's great conquests is indeed the overcoming of racism. Unfortunately, however, there are new and worrying examples of this in various countries, often linked to social and economic problems that nonetheless can never justify contempt or racial discrimination.\"</p> <p>Berlusconi's family minister, Giovanardi, denied Benedict's words were aimed at the government. \"The pope has a global perspective\", he said. \"He wasn't talking about Italy.\"</p> <p>Famiglia Cristiana's editor, Father Antonio Sciortino, agreed that the pope \"was certainly speaking to the whole world\". But he added: \"And therefore also to Italy where, sorry to say, there are many signs of racism that trouble us and which cannot be hidden.\"</p> <p>Urged on by his allies in the anti-immigrant Northern League, Berlusconi has ordered a crackdown on crime, and the illegal immigrants his government says is responsible for a disproportionate share of it. </p> <p>Earlier this month, the Berlusconi government ordered troops onto the streets to combat an alleged crime wave it blames largely on illegal immigrants and Roma. Interior ministry figures show that more than a third of the arrests carried out by police last year were of non-Italians.</p> <p>Illegal immigration has been made an offence; mayors have been given new security powers, and deportations have been stepped up. </p> <p>So far, church leaders have been far more outspoken in their criticism of the government's policies than Italy's main, centre-left opposition party. Earlier this month, they succeeded in blocking an attempt by the mayor of Rome to pass a measure - seemingly aimed at Gypsies - that banned people from rummaging in garbage containers.</p> <p>In June, Famiglia Cristiana said a government plan to take the fingerprints of Roma children was \"indecent\".</p>",
  "<p>A paedophile who acted as a \"librarian\" for a global internet child abuse ring was handed an indefinite jail term today after one of the biggest undercover police investigations into online child abuse.</p> <p>Philip Thompson, 27, collected nearly 250,000 indecent pictures of children as part of a global ring that reached 33 countries, including the UK, the US, Australia and Canada, Teesside crown court heard. </p> <p>More than 3,000 of the images found on Thompson's computers were in the worst category of child abuse images.</p> <p>Thompson, who was unemployed and lived with his mother, admitted 27 charges today, including 16 counts of making indecent photographs of children, seven of distributing indecent photographs of children and one count of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity. </p> <p>Judge Michael Taylor said he posed a very \"significant risk\" to the public and therefore he would be imposing an indeterminate prison sentence for public protection. \"You have shown that you are a very dangerous individual indeed. I consider that you pose a very significant risk to the public and you are a dangerous offender.\"</p> <p>Thompson was told he would have to serve a minimum jail term of three years and nine months but the judge warned it may be much longer. Thompson will also be placed on the sex offenders' register for life. </p> <p>During the investigation, which began in May 2007, police identified 360 suspects across the world and saved 15 children from abuse. </p> <p>Prosecutor Harry Hadfield told the court police raided Thompson's home in February this year and recovered two desktop computers and a laptop. \"Forensic analysis by computer experts established that the defendant had 241,000 indecent photographs of children, being one of the largest seizures of indecent photographs in the UK,\" he said.</p> <p>Thompson was the moderator for an online forum used by paedophiles across the world to trade in child pornography, the court heard. </p> <p>\"The defendant's role was to police the website, which gave him the opportunity to transfer these images to his computer. The evidence recovered from his computer showed he had amassed a vast collection of indecent photographs of children. It appeared the defendant kept some of the most serious images to use as trading chips.\" </p> <p>Thompson's barrister, Brian Russell, said his client had cooperated fully with the police during their investigation. </p> <p>\"This is really a young man who has fallen into that stereotype of a rather sad and lonely teenager who spends too much time in a darkened room in front of a computer screen,\" Russell said. \"He has not had much life experience to get himself mature.\" </p> <p>Thompson used his computer skills to moderate an invitation-only website featuring borderline images of children. Once users had signed up, they would be offered access to more secretive online environments where images and information about vulnerable children were exchanged.</p> <p>Jim Gamble, chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, said: \"This website, while appearing to operate on the margins of legality, was clearly a front for the sinister, sexual abuse of children and an image trading ground for paedophiles. There is a simple message for those individuals like Thompson, who think they can go to this website \u2014 or indeed any space on the internet \u2014 and discuss their sexual interest in children and share images. You leave a digital footprint. We will track you down and hold you to account.\"</p>",
  "<p>A British soldier was killed in Afghanistan today during a Taliban attack on a patrol in the southern part of the country, the Ministry of Defence said.</p> <p>The dead soldier, a member of the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland on attachment with the 1st Battalion the Royal Irish Regiment, died when an improvised explosive went off during a routine patrol in the Gereshk region of Helmand province at about 8.25am.</p> <p>He is the 116th member of the British forces to have died in the country since the start of operations in November 2001.

  "<p>The Green party is a modest but growing political force in the land. Yet for all the growing eco-consciousness there remains a difficulty for the party in its tendency to wallow in hairshirt dreariness. Its willingness to blame the planet's woes on humanity borders on self-loathing. Some members revel in demanding a constrained human existence \u2013 rather in the manner of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_Dei\">Opus Dei</a> carrying out self-flagellation. They give the impression that if some technological breakthrough were found that stopped global warming and meant we could all carry on consuming with cheerful abandon, they would be nonplussed.</p> <p>Anyway I was delighted to find my prejudices about Greens <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/21/travelandtransport.carbonemissions\">challenged by a proposal</a> from the Green group in the London Assembly for a cable car crossing over the River Thames in east London, between Newham and Bexley. This is a life-enhancing measure that would surely add to the jollity of life in the capital. It was prompted by a proposal by Ken Livingstone for a Thames Gateway Bridge, the rationale being that as east London cranks up for the next Olympics, part of the legacy needs to be enhanced transport infrastructure. Certainly east London is less well served than west London in terms of river crossings.</p> <p>Could Newham become the new Zagreb? Could Bexley become the new Singapore? Soon the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, will need to decide whether to proceed with his predecessor's Thames Gateway Bridge \u2013 a road bridge with six lanes at a cost of \u00a3455m (although normally with these grand TfL projects you can add a few hundred million to the estimate to arrive at the true cost). Or Mayor Johnson could agree to a (much cheaper) alternative from the Green party, for a cable car crossing.</p> <p>Naturally the Green party have opposed the bridge, on the grounds of it being a recipe for pollution - and so have many local residents. But where the Greens are to be commended is in offering the positive alternative of a cable car crossing. Probably Johnson will go along with his predecessor's plans. But he has <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=17795\">at least promised</a> to consider the alternative.</p> <p>\"We do need another crossing east of Tower Bridge,\" he says, adding, \"we will look at cable cars.\" </p> <p>The advantages are considerable. Low cost. A crossing time of a mere two minutes without any anxiety of traffic jams. And a very enjoyable two minutes they will be too, with great views that are sure to prove popular with tourists, as the London Eye has shown.</p> <p>The Green's report cites international examples of cable car river crossings including New York where the East River is crossed, connecting the Upper East Side with Roosevelt Island. It opened in 1976 with the intention of being a temporary expedient until the underground was built, but has proved so popular it has been retained. In Cologne a cable car has crossed the Rhine since 1957.</p> <p>The Greens asked the cable car manufacturers Doppermayr, with experience in 79 countries, about a Thames crossing and they were naturally keen, offering \"an initial assessment that it would be technically feasible\". The Economist has <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11900551\">tentatively praised</a> the idea not least on the grounds of its low cost.</p> <p>Aside from all the data about economic and ecological balance sheets, the report points out the benefit of the cable car option, including: \"local affection, due to its innovative character, maximum scenic opportunities and 'buzz'.\"</p> <p>Too much public transport is an essentially soulless experience. Johnson has understood this in terms of his wish to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/03/boris.london1\">restore the Routemaster</a>, befriend the cyclist and expand the river bus. Agreeing to the cable car crossing would be consistent with that approach. The Green party has come up with a way of making life in London more fun \u2013 the mayor should grant them victory.</p>",
  "<p>Chinese shares slumped to a 20-month low today, with airlines, oil companies and other stocks dropping sharply amid anxiety about the wider economic outlook.</p> <p>The continuing slide - which saw the benchmark index close 62% below its peak last October - comes on top of concern about a post-<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics2008\">Olympic</a> hangover and news last week that factory gate inflation had hit a 12-year high.</p> <p>The Shanghai Composite Index shed 5.3%, to close at 2,319.87, while the Shenzhen Composite Index slipped 5.9% to 656.08.</p> <p>Analysts blamed today's fall on hopes of support thwarted in weekend discussions between government regulators and the official Chinese media.</p> <p>The talks suggested that the authorities \"would not take any move to save the poor market,\" said Zhai Peng, a strategist at Guotai Junan Securities in Shanghai.</p> <p>The China Securities Regulatory Comission said it was concerned about the plunge and would seek to stabilise the market, but Zhai said its comments were \"far below investors' expectations.\"</p> <p>Steven Leung, director with UOB Kay Hian, warned: \"The larger concern over slowing growth in the economy will continue to weigh.\"</p> <p>Airlines, which reported falling demand last month partly due to Olympic-related visa restrictions, were among today's biggest losers. China Southern Airlines, Air China and China Eastern Airlines all plunged by around 10%.</p> <p>Oil refiners also suffered and coal shares sagged following the announcement of export taxes to address a coal shortage.</p> <p>In Hong Kong the Hang Seng index fell by 1.1% to 20,930.67 - its lowest close since last August - on the back of concerns about mainland firms.</p> <p>Exporters have been hit by the global downturn and rising costs.

Yet the producer price index soared, hitting a 10% increase year-on-year.</p> <p>\"So far, the burden has all been on companies because there's so much overcapacity no one has any room to pass on the costs,\" said Andy Rothman, CLSA's China strategist, blaming the increase on higher global prices for raw materials and energy.</p> <p>\"We are starting to see companies going out of business. After six to 12 months, the survivors will have less competition and be able to raise prices more. But it's a very slow, gradual process.\"</p> <p>He suggested CPI, already down from 8.7% to 6.3%, would fall to 5% by the end of the year because its earlier increase had been driven by food price growth which had now halted. He added that he still believed China's slowdown would be a mild one.</p> <p>\"All of the indicators this year have been within expectations; the economy has slowed down to prevent inflation,\" added Zuo Xiaolei, chief economist of Galaxy Securities, citing the government's \"two prevents\" of avoiding economic overheating and rising inflation.</p> <p>But Michael Pettis, finance professor at Peking University, predicted that inflation could reach 8 or 9% by December and warned that domestic consumption could stall.</p> <p>\"The spending numbers have been quite good recently, but it could be because of the Olympics. There seems to be a lot of related spending,\" he said.</p> <p>\"There's been so much excitement generated. it seems hard to me to say that we won't see some sort of short term hangover at least.\"</p> <p>The yuan has also been falling against the dollar over the last month after a period of steady appreciation, although analysts disagree on the causes.</p> <p>Explanations include the strengthened dollar or a deliberate attempt by the Chinese authorities to boost exports.</p>",
  "<p>The 2009 Darwin celebrations are officially under way, now that we are halfway through Richard Dawkins' flagship TV series, <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/F/famelab/\">The Genius of Charles Darwin</a>. But I can't help but feel they have not begun well. Dawkins' exploration of the science seems to be driven mostly by his desire to score atheistic points: this is not evolution as survival of the fittest but as zero-sum game.</p> <p>It is a wasted opportunity on at least two accounts. First, making much of creationism and intelligent design only feeds them the oxygen of publicity. Most Christians find accommodation with evolution, and welcome it. \"Darwinism appeared, and, under the guise of a foe, did the work of a friend,\" wrote Aubrey Moore, the late-Victorian Anglo-Catholic theologian. Why not celebrate that? Wouldn't it be a better strategy than giving creationism prime time?</p> <p>It would leave more room for the science too. Which leads to the second point. The science of evolution is becoming much more interesting than a black and white presentation of it allows. Moreover, for believers, it is starting to look far less bleak than the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" implies.</p> <p>Such directions are explored in a new collection of essays by leading evolutionists, philosophers and theologians in a book, entitled <a href=\"http://www.templetonpress.org/book.asp?book_id=119\">The Deep Structure of Biology</a>. The central issue under discussion in this case is that of evolutionary convergence. The editor of the book is also the great champion of convergence, namely the Cambridge paleontologist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Conway_Morris\">Simon Conway Morris</a>.</p> <p>The work of Conway Morris, and now many others, is showing that evolution keeps coming up with the same solutions to natural problems. One of the better-known examples is that sabre-toothed cats. They evolved on at least three different occasions along independent Darwinian paths. And yet they look almost exactly the same. Dozens of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution\">examples of convergence</a> have now been documented across a wide variety of biological phenomena, from animal and plant physiology to molecular biology.</p> <p>Convergence raises the possibility of directionality in evolution. This is anathema to the old school. Strictly speaking, even to talk of adaptations being advantageous is to risk a false sense of teleology. The sense of \"advantage\" only comes because we have hindsight. As <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/weekly/interview960923.html\">Stephen Jay Gould</a> put it: according to this interpretation of evolution, if you re-ran the \"tape of life\", life would look very different.</p> <p>Convergence challenges this, because in a way, evolution has already re-run the tape of life several times, and it looks strikingly similar. The implications that might be drawn from convergence is what Conway Morris' new book explores. One of the essays, entitled Purpose in a Darwinian World, is written by the philosopher of evolution, <a href=\"http://calitreview.com/80\">Professor Michael Ruse</a>.</p> <p>Ruse points out that in one way, convergence is not at all surprising. Evolution does not just work on the basis of random mutations. It also works because those random mutations find niches to occupy in the environment. To put it another way, Darwinian processes \"design\" organisms to exploit aspects of the natural world.</p> <p>Ruse reminds readers that some Darwinians believe that evolution itself creates niches, rather than discovers them. However, that can't always be the case. For example, lungs need the niche of an atmosphere to evolve: the evolution of lungs doesn't create air.</p> <p>However, the phenomenon of convergence is used to take the possibility of directionality a step further. For what happens if you consider not only elements such as air, water and land to be environmental niches that Darwinian processes can exploit, but elements such as culture and intelligence too? The old school believes that evolution itself creates the niches of culture and intelligence. But what if instead of creating these niches, evolution is exploring pre-existing realities that in this respect can be thought of as analogous to air, water and land?</p> <p>It sounds pretty speculative, until you consider, say, mathematics. At least some human's brains are capable of doing mathematics. Perhaps some other animal's brains are too. But is mathematics created or discovered? It seems more natural to think of mathematics as existing regardless of the presence of human beings, as, say, the laws of nature presumably exist in the universe too. So maybe the evolution of culture and intelligence are not just by-products of humankind's evolution as a social animal. Perhaps, they are also ways of discovering and exploring pre-existing realities. Conway Morris himself has tentatively suggested that the brain could be thought of as an evolving \"antenna\" that detects mentality which is itself independent of human intelligence.</p> <p>It is no surprise that religious believers warm to such suggestions. And they might appeal for other reasons too. For example, if there is some kind of independent mentality within the universe, then this might help us to understand the existence of consciousness. Think of another branch of science, quantum mechanics. As the physicist Eugene Wigner put it: \"The very study of the external world led to the conclusion that the content of consciousness is an ultimate reality.\" Consciousness existing like air, land and water? It is a contentious proposition but not simply \"not science\".</p> <p>Ruse himself is more cautious: it is easy to run ahead of the science. \"Darwinism has major implications for thoughts of purpose,\" he concludes, but be careful. On the other hand, it is easy to lag behind the science too, not least when evolution is used as a political stick rather than celebrated as part of the human quest for knowledge.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/hiscox\">Hiscox</a>, the insurer known for policies covering fine art, kidnapping and natural disasters, has dodged the gloom in the financial sector and reported record results today.</p> <p>Despite ongoing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">turmoil in financial markets</a>, pre-tax profits at the Bermuda-based company, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lloydsoflondon\">Lloyd's of London</a> underwriter, climbed to \u00a3109.2m in the first six months of the year, from \u00a3105.6m a year ago. The firm raised its interim dividend by 6.3% to 4.25p a share from 4p a share. The shares rose 5.5p to 224.75p, up 2.5%.</p> <p>\"It is very pleasing (and slightly surreal) to be able to announce record half-year results when the financial markets are in turmoil,\" said the chairman, Robert Hiscox.</p> <p>As part of its speciality insurance business, Hiscox insures people and businesses against the risk of cancellation of events such as the Olympics, Wimbledon and rock concerts. </p> <p>The firm is broadening its operations beyond the London market as it expects prices for insuring\"'big-ticket risks\" like natural disasters and terrorism to fall further, and plans to cut underwriting capacity at Lloyds to \u00a3600m next year. </p> <p>\"We don't see anything that's going to change the pricing environment,\" said the chief executive, Bronek Masojada. \"If prices are coming down, we take less risk and we're shrinking that business.\"</p> <p>Reinsurance rates are under pressure after two catastrophe-free years.The insurer's biggest division, global markets, suffered a 23% fall in gross written premiums to \u00a3344m in the first half, but this was offset by sharply higher premiums and profits at its regional businesses. </p> <p>The international operation, which covers Bermuda, the United States and Guernsey, made \u00a320.3m of profits, up from \u00a312.1m last year. The UK and European businesses, which offer cover to wealthy individuals and small companies, made \u00a316.3m, up from \u00a36.6m. Hiscox has launched a new luxury motor insurance in the UK.</p> <p>Investment income dropped to \u00a317.3m from \u00a346.8m last year, but the firm stressed that it had not had a single bond default and the negative returns had come from equities. Rivals Beazley and Catlin have suffered falling profits due to a slump in investment income. </p> <p>Second-half profits will depend on the hurricane season, Masojada said, adding: \"Thus far it's been a reasonably active year for hurricanes but we have had relatively little insurance impact.\"</p> <p>Numis analyst Nick Johnson said: \"Hiscox sounds a bullish note for the second half, saying there is no reason why it should not be good, barring the extraordinary.\"<br></p>",
  "<p>My phone rings. It is my brother. I am instantly worried. He hardly ever calls me, and whenever he does it is invariably with bad news. My heart is racing as I answer. \"Hello,\" he says, \"just thought I would ring to see how you are.\" This is without precedent. My brother asking about me? What is going on? </p> <p>Slowly it becomes clear. He is in Spain with his wife and children staying in a beachside apartment owned by a friend. For years this friend has been urging my brother to visit and for years my brother had refused. Holidays were for losers apparently, for people with nothing better to do than sit by the sea. Why do nothing when you could be doing something that might earn money? This year, my brother had relented and agreed to a week in the Med. The combination of the Spanish sun, the sight of his children happily playing in the sea and the fact that he was not in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/sep/27/communities.books\">Luton</a> had clearly worked wonders. My brother, with whom I usually have stilted, awkward conversations, seemed an entirely different person as he rhapsodised about the pleasures of lazing on a beach and expressed regret he had never been on such a holiday before. </p> <p>I grew up in a family that missed out on holidays. There were no trips to the seaside, no jaunts to Spain, France or Italy, no camping or caravanning. Nothing. Each year the school <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/summerholidays\">summer holidays</a> would stretch out across July and August, an ocean of possibilities that would remain unexplored. The nearest to a holiday for us was a visit to family friends who lived in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemel_Hempstead\">Hemel Hempstead</a>. This was partly a consequence of not having any money; raising four children and working on the production line at Vauxhall did not leave my father much for luxuries. This was before budget airlines, when foreign holidays were still the preserve of the fortunate. But my father insisted there was another reason we missed out on holidays; because he simply didn't understand the point of them. Holidays were a criminal waste of time and money. \"These white people sit in the sun trying to make their skins brown,\" he would say, \"but we look like that already! You see how lucky you are?\"</p> <p>I grew up being told that not taking holidays was an example of cultural superiority. Looking back now I realise how wrong I was. My family album consists entirely of photographs taken at home, mostly birthdays or stiffly posed images of my family sitting on sofas or standing in the back garden. There is a striking lack of any photographs taken outside our house. How might life have been different? I imagine a family holiday provides the opportunity to see one's relatives in a different light, the change of scenery and location perhaps loosening up the roles we play. That loosening of the roles inspired my brother to call me. Lying in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/spain\">Spanish sun</a> he temporarily forgot we don't really get on. \"Now I finally understand why white people go on beach holidays,\" he told me.</p> <p>Even as I was pleased for my brother I couldn't help reflecting on how I have never been on a proper family holiday that included my sisters and mother. My mother is now 75 and rather frail. She would also like to travel but believes that it is no longer in her fate. I suggested there were alternatives to beach holidays and city breaks, that we could hire a villa for the whole family but she was not convinced. \"What would be the point,\" she said sadly \"of sitting around in a house somewhere abroad when that is all I do here in Luton?\" As we talked she told me of her long-held wish to visit Mecca, the dream to one day visit India. I realised that my father's bluster about the futility of travel was largely a means of masking his frustration. In the years before he brought us to Britain my father had travelled and I am sure he would have dearly loved to take us on holidays. But we did not have the means and his method of dealing with this was to tell himself and us that we were better than those pitiful souls who did.</p> <p>I have enthusiastically tried to make up for my lack of childhood holidays by travelling as much as finances and opportunities will allow. This year I am visiting, for work, India three times, the US three times, and Italy and Turkey. My <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbonfootprints\">carbon footprint</a> is likely to be huge and I don't in the least feel guilty. Those keenest to lecture others on the evils of cheap flights are, I have always suspected, those most likely to have come from charmed and comfortable middle-class lives filled with foreign holidays. For the rest of us budget airlines have opened up the world.</p> <p>When I asked my brother why, after all these years, he had agreed to go on a beach holiday he told me that the children had demanded it. Now my brother was able to do better for his own kids; I found this deeply moving, how so often it is the children who are the engines of progress, the rays of hope propelling their sometimes reluctant parents towards the sun dappled future.</p>",
  "<p>At least 200 million people around the world risk their health daily by eating food grown using untreated waste water, some of which may be contaminated with heavy metals and raw sewage, according to major study of 53 world cities.</p> <p>Urban farmers in 80% of the cities surveyed were found to be using untreated waste water, but the study said they also provided vital food for burgeoning cities at a time of unprecedented water scarcity and the worst food crisis in 30 years. </p> <p>The study from the UN-backed <a href=\"http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/\">International Water Management Institute </a> (IMWI), said the practice of using waste water to grow food in urban areas was not confined to the poorest countries.</p> <p>\"It's a widespread phenomenon, occurring on 20m hectares across the developing world, especially in Asian countries like China, India and Vietnam, but also around nearly every city of sub-Saharan Africa and in many Latin American cities as well,\" said IWMI researcher Liqa Raschid-Sally.</p> <p>\"Nor is it limited to the countries and cities with the lowest GDP.

Even if they do, monitoring and enforcement rarely happen and may not be realistic. As a result, though the practice may be theoretically forbidden or controlled, it is \"unofficially tolerated.\" </p> <p>Earlier in 2008, the UN's <a href=\"http://www.who.int/en/\">World Health Organization</a> stated that a global environmental and health crisis was unfolding with more than 200m tonnes of human waste a year being dumped untreated in water systems, exposing hundreds of millions of people to disease.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://cms.iucn.org/\">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), said on Sunday that rivers around the world are now seriously polluted \"to the brink of collapse\".</p> <p>\"Many rivers in developing countries and emerging economies are now polluted to the brink of collapse. For example, the Yangtze, China's longest river, is suffering because of pollution by untreated waste, agricultural run-off and industrial discharge\", said a spokesman.</p>",

  "<p><br>A floating tuna transport tank in the Mediterranean. Photograph: Gavin Newman/AFP/Getty</p> <p>One less headache at the supermarket. <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/press-releases/thousands-sharks-and-turtles-wiped-out-tined-tuna-20080813\">Greenpeace</a>, God bless them, would appear to have made the tricky business of selecting your canned tuna a lot simpler: <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/oceans/john-west-worst-tinned-tuna-20080813\">don't buy John West</a>, do buy from Sainsbury's (the full league table is below). Don't necessarily trust the \"dolphin friendly\" label, which is more complex than it appears. If you really want to keep the turtles and dolphins (and sharks, and other bycatch) safe then \"pole and line-caught\" is the only reliable promise (here's a useful guide to the <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/oceans/tinned-tuna-quick-guide-fishing-methods\">different fishing methods</a>). Or you could just buy <a href=\"http://www.sea-fishing.org/sea-pollack.html\">pollack</a>.</p> <p>But is it that simple?</p> <p>There is clearly a good argument not to eat any tuna at all. Regulation and policing of the tuna fisheries is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/11/fishing.food\">incompetent </a> (<a href=\"http://www.iccat.int/\">Iccat</a>, the international body set up 42 years ago to monitor and preserve the stocks has long been known in the business as the International Conspiracy to Catch All Tuna). In their defence, controlling the fishing industry is probably impossible: it is clearly determined to keep on trawling into oblivion, as blind to the red lights and alarm bells as Captain Haddock on a bender. Our unstoppable demand for tuna - any tuna - will in the end destroy all the species.</p> <p>Because many kinds of tuna are similar, fishermen have no trouble passing off the seriously endangered (like <a href=\"http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=236\">bluefin</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigeye_tuna\">bigeye</a>) as other species, and thus getting round quota regulations. Bluefin, the source of the most prized <a href=\"http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2044.html\">sashimi</a>, is the world's most expensive fish. It is also the most endangered animal on the planet that is still killed legally and commercially.</p> <p>Using the term \"dolphin friendly\", a familiar label since the 90s, is a bit like calling a lorry \"child-friendly\". It all depends how well the machinery is used. It may merely mean that trawling fleet uses nets with an escape hatch for larger marine animals like dolphins. These may work - but they certainly don't mean 100% \"<a href=\"http://www.earthisland.org/dolphinSafeTuna/consumer/\">dolphin safe</a>\" (though that's the label used in the United States). And the nets still scoop up huge numbers of immature fish and other species which will then be discarded. </p> <p>The \"<a href=\"http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fisheries/recreational/saltwater-fishing/fads\">fish aggregation device</a>\" (Fad) buoys that attract tuna and report their presence to fishermen are used a lot in the fishery of supposedly adequately stocked species like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skipjack_tuna\">skipjack</a> - but they also attract the scarcer big tuna, sharks and other predators, which then die along with the rest of the fish. (There's a <a href=\"http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fisheries/recreational/saltwater-fishing/fads\">comprehensive explanation of Fads here</a>.) </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/press-releases/thousands-sharks-and-turtles-wiped-out-tined-tuna-20080813\">Greenpeace says 1kg of other fish die for every 10kg of tuna</a> produced in netting systems that use Fads, and they are the reason why John West came in for a particular caning. So too did John West's \"general approach\" and their labelling. The JW <a href=\"http://www.john-west.co.uk/our-products/tuna/all/\">website</a> claims \"John West tuna is caught with no threat to dolphins\". \"No threat to dolphins\" implies a level of care that no one using the phrase \"dolphin friendly\" could claim to comply with - \"lesser threat to dolphins\" would be more honest.</p> <p>\"Dolphin safe\" and \"dolphin friendly\" are terms that still cause <a href=\"http://tursiops.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=6260\">rancorous debate</a> between the different environmental organisations. The dolphin friendly movement has succeeded in stopping the old Pacific purse seine netting strategy which used to deliberately net schools of dolphin in order to catch the tuna they were chasing. But there's no method that uses nets that can honestly claim (as the label does in the States) it is utterly \"dolphin safe\". Line and pole is the only truly safe label - and the only one that doesn't result in wasteful by-catch.</p> <p>John West, which is the UK's biggest supplier, denies the charges. Their <a href=\"http://www.john-west.co.uk/john%2Dwest%2Ds%2Dresponse%2Dto%2Dgreenpeace%2Dreport/\">statement at the end of last week</a> says they think Greenpeace has misrepresented them, and that they are seeking an urgent meeting. The company told WoM that its buying practices avoid areas in the Pacific where tuna fishing is likely to harm dolphins. It said too that tuna fishing has been cleared of harming turtles in serious numbers by the California-based NGO <a href=\"http://www.earthisland.org/index.php/aboutUs/board/\">Earth Island Institute</a>.</p> <p>Here's <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/oceans/the-tuna-retailers-league-table-2008\">Greenpeace's league table of the suppliers</a>: </p> <p><strong>Sainsbury's</strong></p> <p>All of Sainsbury's tinned tuna is now pole and line caught, making their own-brand the only one that is entirely fished using sustainable methods. </p> <p><strong>Co-Op</strong> </p> <p>Around 50 per cent of the Co-op's tinned tuna is caught using pole and line. </p> <p><strong>Marks and Spencer</strong> </p> <p>Good overall seafood procurement policy, but a great deal of their tuna comes from fishing boats that have no restriction on the use of FADs. </p> <p><strong>Asda</strong></p> <p>Show awareness of the problems, but a great deal of their tuna comes from fishing boats that have no restriction on the use of FADs and the tins fail to say how the fish was caught. Have expressed some support for marine reserves. </p> <p><strong>Morrisons</strong></p> <p>Again, some awareness of the problems, a great deal of their tuna comes from fishing boats that have no restriction on the use of FADs and the tins fail to say how the fish was caught. </p> <p><strong>Tesco</strong></p> <p>The majority of Tesco tuna comes from boats that have no restrictions on using FADs, and they fail to tell customers how the fish was caught. </p> <p><strong>Princes</strong> </p> <p>No restrictions on the use of FADs, no support for marine reserves and Princes tins never say how the fish was caught. </p> <p><strong>John West</strong></p> <p>Never tells consumers how the tuna was caught, no restrictions on the use of FADs for the majority of their catch, no support for marine reserves and more widespread use of tuna from stocks under specific threat. And the John West general sustainable seafood policy is lacking basic credibility.</p>",

Have you tried to sell your property or are you happy to let nature take its course?</p> <p>While promising to do his \"level best\" to try to defend communities where \"there are significant numbers of properties under threat and where it's possible to find engineering solutions\", Smith warns: \"We are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast - it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms.\"</p> <p>Next year, the agency will publish details of the work done on specific coastal threats, he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the ASA boss, Smith tells MediaGuardian about concerns over a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/18/asa.advertising\">sharp rise in environmental claims made for goods and services</a>.</p> <p>\"The raison d'etre for the ASA is that companies can make the best possible claims for their product, but not mislead people. I absolutely don't want to discourage them from doing so - the more that companies think seriously about the environmental impact of their products the better. But what they mustn't do is pretend a product is greener than it is.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>theguardian.com writers' prediction: 16th Odds: 7,500-1</strong><br> There is a highly dubious perception, held by many males, that good-looking (sic) girls subconsciously choose an ugly (sic) best friend, and vice versa. The logic is that the good-looking girl has her attractiveness accentuated, and the ugly girl gets to hang around in otherwise impenetrable circles. Women may feel the same about men; I don't know. <br>West Brom had no choice about who was by their side as they entered the Premier League, but the perceived rancidity of the features of both Stoke and Hull - teams apparently so bad that not even their own mother would back them to stay up - has accentuated West Brom's beauty, and led many to assert with authority that they have a better than even chance of avoiding relegation, even if that judgment is based on little more than the fact that all three promoted sides have not been relegated for over a decade.</p> <p>Here is a more relevant statistic: West Brom's total of 81 points last season was the lowest by the champions of England's second tier since the advent of three points for a win 28 years ago. While they play some admirably aesthetic stuff, and you really want them to succeed as a result, there is legitimate concern as to whether they are actually <em>that</em> good.<br> <br>Their manager Tony Mowbray is an estimable and almost painfully decent fellow, who somehow managed to bring total football to the Championship - the sporting equivalent of bringing dignity to Wetherspoons - and who is inexplicably never mentioned when jobs in the Premier League's second tier become available. If Mark Hughes is Britain's best young manager, Mowbray is surely the most enlightened.<br> <br>Mowbray is a romantic, but he is not sentimental. He knew his existing squad wasn't quite up to it, and has made eight signings this summer as a consequence. But of those, only Scott Carson and Abdoulaye Meite have anything resembling Premier League pedigree. With the exception of Stoke and Hull, it is difficult to see that many teams who could finish below West Brom: Fulham and Bolton certainly; Blackburn, Middlesbrough and Sunderland maybe. There aren't many others.</p> <p>At least West Brom have a style that is theoretically suited to their new environment. They are basically Arsenal-lite. The ball will shimmer across the turf like a bowling ball; they will wait, wait and wait for the right moment, playing football that could have come from a Grolsch advert; even the goalkeeper is expected to contribute. The purest football side in the division will be on show at the Emirates on Saturday lunchtime, but it might not be managed by Ars\u00e9ne Wenger.<br> <br>Like Wenger, Mowbray is a kind of football pacifist. Principles can be terribly powerful. In No Country For Old Men, principles drive Anton Chigurh to <a href=\" http://www.thedailypage.com/movies/article.php?article=14541\">all manner of brutality</a>. Yet they can also vanish in the time it takes a broad to dangle a stockinged leg, or a hood open a satchel full of greenbacks. How strong Mowbray's principles are will surely be the decisive factor in whether his club avoid relegation. Because if he loses his nerve and compromises them, a group of players schooled to play only one way will be buggered.</p> <p>At the moment, those principles seem intractable. But Mowbray - apart form his four-game spell at Ipswich - has never before been in an environment where his side lose more often than they win, and such circumstances will test the resolution of both the manager and his players. For now the precedent of Reading, who refused to compromise their footballing ways and achieved beyond their wildest dreams, will fuel West Brom (as with Reading in 2006-07, it is probably more important to West Brom than most that they start well). In February, after four straight defeats, it might be more difficult for Mowbray to turn the other cheek.</p> <p>Mowbray has cited last season's FA Cup semi-final, in which West Brom gave as good as they got against Portsmouth, as evidence that a mid-table place is achievable. But this is a flawed notion. West Brom went into that game high on life, and a successful season, and consequently played very well. But it was a one-off. To play such teams every week, on the back of losing a good helping of games, will inevitably drain the confidence that is the essence of sporting achievement. It's not strictly true that you can't play your way out of trouble, but it takes a serious combination of stones and talent to do so once you've set foot on the relegation quicksand.</p> <p>Mowbray has at least attempted to reduce the ultimate significance of these creative variables by addressing the side's biggest weakness, a defence that conceded four goals at home on three occasions last season, with the signings of Meite, Scott Carson, who should resume normal, reliable service away from the spotlight, the Dutch Under-21 full-back Gianni Zuiverloon and Marek Cech, an impressive Slovakian who can play left-back or left-wing. </p> <p>It will be interesting to see whether Mowbray persists with the lookalike central-midfield pair of Jonathan Greening and the Slovenian Robert Koren. Both are very decent ball players, especially Koren, but the lack of an orthodox holding player might leave the defence uncomfortably exposed. One way round it, particularly away from home, will be the safety in numbers offered by 4-5-1, with Greening slightly deeper than Koren and the Korean international Do-heon Kim.</p> <p>The loss of Zoltan Gera, who joined Fulham on a Bosman, might not be as big a blow as many feel: he was not always a regular last season, and James Morrison and Chris Brunt - who in the best Arsenal traditions can play on the wrong wing so that they can come inside and shape play by playing quick one-twos or threading passes through the eye of the needle - offer good options, along with Cech.</p> <p>Kevin Phillips will be sorely missed, for his experience as much as the goals he would inevitably bequeath. Luke Moore has much to prove, and Ishmael Miller probably remains too rough around the edges for the Premier League. Almost by a process of elimination, Roman Bednar looks the most reliable of the three main centre forwards.<br>West Brom are certainly the most reliable of the three newcomers. They look good, too, but that doesn't mean they won't end their big night out going back whence they came with only Stoke and Hull for company.</p> <p><strong>In:</strong> Luke Moore (Aston Villa - \u00a33m), Scott Carson (Liverpool - \u00a33.25m), Do-heon Kim (Seongnam Ilhwa Shunma, \u00a3500,000), Roman Bednar (Hearts - \u00a32.5m), Gianni Zuiverloon (Heerenveen, \u00a32.3m), Marek Cech (Porto - \u00a31.4m), Graham Dorrans (Livingston, \u00a3100,000), Abdoulaye Meite (Bolton - \u00a32m)</p> <p><strong>Out:</strong> Luke Steele (Barnsley - free), Zoltan Gera (Fulham - free), Martin Albrechtsen (Derby - free), Curtis Davies (Aston Villa - undisclosed), Kevin Phillips (Birmingham - free), Stefan Morrison (Swansea - free), Luke Daniels (Shrewsbury \u2013 loan), Lee Baker (Kidderminster \u2013free)</p>",
  "<p>Tessa Jowell makes a good point about politicians and popularity in her <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/tessa-jowell-you-ask-the-questions-900667.html\">\"You ask the questions interview\" in the Independent today.</a></p> <p>Asked whether she would rather win an Olympic gold or be prime minister, she replies:</p> <blockquote> <p>Olympic gold, without a doubt. Being prime minister is the most thankless task in the world. Everyone is convinced they could do a better job and lets you know it. But no one looks at Michael Phelps and thinks 'I could swim faster than him; he's rubbish.'</p> </blockquote> <p>It's not much of a consolation to Brown, but it's true.</p> <p>Jowell is less convincing when asked why Brown is so unpopular.</p> <blockquote> <p>Politicians are invariably unpopular - the times when they genuinely aren't can be counted on the fingers of one hand. And in the kind of economic circumstances we see now, they are all the more unpopular; they have to absorb people's anger and anxiety while trying to create the right measures to mitigate the effects on families of this global downturn.</p> </blockquote> <p>She is glossing over the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2481215/Gordon-Browns-personal-popularity-hits-historic-low-poll-shows.html\">polling evidence</a> suggesting that, even for a serving prime minister, Brown's ratings are still remarkably low at the moment. I can remember Tony Blair being asked in an interview in 1997 about the fact that he had a 93% approval rating. That was the poll that prompted Bob Marshall-Andrews to respond: \"Seven per cent opposed - we've got something to build on.\"</p> <p>But Jowell is broadly right about politicians and popularity. On Friday I wrote a blogpost about the revelation that <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/08/john_macdougall_regretted_beco.html\">the late John MacDougall regretted becoming an MP.</a></p> <p>I suggested that this was unusual. But the Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan responded with a post claiming that <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/daniel_hannan/blog/2008/08/15/plenty_of_mps_hate_their_jobs\">plenty of MPs hate their jobs.</a> Predictably, he attributes some of the blame to the EU (for rendering MPs powerless), but he makes other points too. And he claims that what is particularly awful for MPs is the realisation they've entered a career cul-de-sac.</p> <blockquote> <p>By the time he realises how irrelevant he is, another grisly truth is dawning: there is no going back. A stretch in Westminster has made him all but unemployable: 80% of ex-MPs are still without work a year after losing their seats. Forget the idea that MPs can walk into directorships, by the way. The era when companies thought that a parliamentarian on their board would lend them respectability is long past. These days, placing \"MP\" after your name is tantamount to an admission of corruption.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's probably another problem Michael Phelps doesn't have to worry about.</p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics2008\">2008 Olympics</a> has created an illusion of China to the public and to the outside world. It is so fantastic, so unreal, that the entire meaning of the games is being distorted. At the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/08/olympics2008.china?picture=336347323\">opening ceremony</a> we saw this global festival <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/olympics2008.china?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">manipulated</a> for the sake of narrow nationalism.</p> <p>The propaganda system of the Chinese government went into overdrive, public money was spent like water and ranks of mediocre performers were employed to create an alternative, distorted reality. It received fake applause from the country's media and public. Officials from the International Olympic Committee and United Nations also collaborated in the deception with their comments on the success of the games and the improvement of the environment.</p> <p>Whatever happened to the non-politicised festival of sport that we were promised? Anyone who cares about truth should avoid not politics, but Olympic lies. Beijing wants to show off how progressive and harmonious the city has become, so it has expelled migrant workers because they are poor, underpaid and seen as a potential source of insecurity. </p> <p>Yet it was these workers \u2013 these slaves with socialist characteristics \u2013 who laid every brick and tile of the modern urban landscape. For the sake <br>of appearances, even the small shops they frequented have been shut down, along with many street markets, video outlets and clubs. So much for the slogans on the bridges and billboards that read \"Beijing welcomes you\" and \"People's Olympics\".</p> <p>China's media organisations have been told they are only allowed to report the sporting achievements of the games. They are forbidden from covering problems or squabbling. They cannot criticise the cliched, rose-tinted statements of the authorities. With so much government interference, how can anyone say these Olympics are not politicised? </p> <p>It is absurd that so much money has been wasted on manipulating public opinion, on simulating emotion. This nation is notorious for its ability to make or fake anything cheaply. \"Made-in-China\" goods now fill homes around the world. But our giant country has a small problem. We can't manufacture the happiness of our people. </p> <p>This is not something that comes cheap. Real public contentment can't be pirated or copied. No matter how long our politicians order people to sing songs of praise, no matter how many fireworks they launch into the heavens, and no matter how many foreign leaders they embrace, they cannot arouse a genuine mood of joy and celebration among the people. It is as difficult for them to get a real smile as it is to keep the sky blue and the clouds white. </p> <p>Neither fairness nor justice, neither reality nor humanity can be simulated or manipulated by wires or remote control. Those who staged the opening ceremony stopped at nothing to create a fantasy. They faked the footprints of fire with computer graphics. They exploited an innocent child by making her lip-synch to a patriotic song. These people are shameless. The organisers recently announced the theme of the closing ceremony. They tell us it will <br>be about \"emotions\" and \"friendship\", that it will be a night of joy.

  "<p>Unifying a fifth of the world's population takes some doing, but Liu Xiang had come pretty close. Two days before the end of the last Olympics, the young sprinter from Shanghai established the format for the next four years of his life when he won gold in Athens, the first Chinese man to triumph in a track and field event in the history of the Games.</p> <p>It was a masterplan that had its route mapped out. Its destination was this Thursday night, the evening of the final of 110m hurdles final in Beijing. It did not need repeating because 1.3 billion people knew what they would be doing no more.</p> <p>This morning at the Bird's Nest Stadium here in Beijing, China's glorious, spectacular production of the greatest sports show lost its star performer. At 11.45am, workers across the country had stopped when Liu Xiang made his way from the call-room to the track, being greeted by close on 90,000 for a session of track and field where only one race mattered. It was the first round of the 110m hurdles, and from the moment the picture of him warming up hit the giant screens, the cheering started.</p> <p>As he emerged on to the track, the flag-waving began. He took his place in lane two. He adjusted his starting blocks and he took off his tracksuit top. But then when he walked to the line, he had more than a slight limp. He stretched out his right leg. He slipped into position. He moved hesitantly when there was a false start. He stood up and, as quickly as he entered, he left.</p> <p>No matter how many gold medals the host nation win or how fast Usain Bolt ran in the 100m or how often Beijing is mentioned in the same sentence as Michael Phelps, Liu Xiang had provided China with its seminal moment of these Games.</p> <p>The shock was palpable on the people. Workers who had united to watch the first appearance of their sporting hero did not utter a word when he wandered away. They just looked at each other, in disbelief.</p> <p>It does not matter if he returns to the Olympics in London in 2012 to make up for this hell. Or if he regains the world record. Or if he wins the world title next summer. Liu Xiang - and those 1.3 billion people - cannot replace their loss.</p> <p>Since that August evening in Athens in 2004, his every move had been scrutinised. He did not hide away. But he was advised to allow it become part of his preparation. Whatever happened, he would be in the spotlight, and it was only going to grow brighter.</p> <p>Few athletes knew what he was going through, but Cathy Freeman was the exception. In Sydney in 2000, the Australian 400m runner was carrying the weight of a country, an Aborigine who bridged the gap of a nation.</p> <p>\"For me, I couldn't afford to get too sentimental about how I made people feel, it's such a personal time in his life, he shouldn't compromise,\" she said of Liu. \"He has to maintain his priorities, keep his perspective. He's already proven that he can perform under pressure and he should pretty much take that model and use it. It's just another day at the office.</p> <p>\"I was absolutely honoured. I didn't see it as a distraction or as a negative, I was so confident in my abilities as an athlete ... there was nothing that was going to detract from my performance.\"</p> <p>And so it proved when she won gold. Only at the end of the race, when she sat on the track looking into space, did the whole occasion get the better of her. She would have still been sitting there if she had her way.</p> <p>Liu knew the pressure, and nothing was going to stop his progress towards Beijing. Except, the curse of the untimely injury. Since May, he has been battling to be fit. Yet it did not stop the biggest scramble for tickets for Thursday night in the Bird's Nest, let alone this morning's round of heats.</p> <p>He had entered the public's prominence when he won gold in Athens, at the time equalling the world record-holder held by Colin Jackson, of Britain, of 12.91. He was the gold medallist in the sport that often defines a Games. China had their talismanic figure, and his every move has been dissected ever since.</p> <p>His victory at the world championships in Osaka last summer only increased the excitement. He had been injured, yes, and in June he had also lost the world record he had taken to 12.88 when Dayron Robles, of Cuba, ran 12.87 in Ostrava. But he did not want to let the people down. The biggest night of them all here was set to be a duel between the pair, but the drama arrived before the final act. Silence among the people. All 1.3 billion of them.</p>",

Still, he's through and is in the \"outside hopes\" category for a medal.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.33am:</strong> An email: \"Don't be so hard on yourself,\" says \"Gareth\". I'll try, but it's not easy. \"I'm sure lots of your readers are perfectly normal working folks who find the live report a concise and accessible way of keeping up with the Olympics.\" Thanks. \"Not me though, I'm on drugs.\" Oh.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2.35am:</strong> Another email, and if in doubt, let's revert to Aussie bashing: \"Another glorious day in Sydney as the locals wake up to find Team GB is way ahead on the medal tables,\" says Steve Keys. \"Of course, I always welcome more facts to really help put the boot in. So, realistically what are our chances of staying ahead of the Aussies by the end of the week? I want details.\" You've come to the wrong place.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>2.37am: Athletics:</strong> Heat five of the 400m goes to Lashawn Merritt of the United States, who is one of the favourites for the title. Sam Weipogwa and Claudio Licciardello are second and third.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>2.40am:</strong> It's the women's hammer throw in which Great Britain's Zoe Derham has just wanged it 64.74m. Just sticking to the facts here. \"Not very good losers, the Aussies,\" says Dave Hill, another British ex-pat Down Under, hopefully preparing the egg that he'll soon be wiping off his chops. \"I've written the medal table in very large letters on our whiteboard at work.\" Keep the wiper handy, that's all I'm saying.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>2.40am: Athletics:</strong> More heats success for Team GB! GB! GB! as Andrew Steele wins the sixth one-lap preliminary race in 44.94 seconds, which is a lifetime best. Renny Quow is second, Michael Mathieu third.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>2.48am: Athetics:</strong> The World Champion Jeremy Warriner eases to first place in his heat and that wraps up the first round of the 400m. The two Brits involved -- Martyn Rooney and Andrew Steele -- both qualified for the semi-finals. Worse news for Alex Nelson, due to run in the 200m, won't. He's knacked a hamstring.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>2.55am:</strong> Kyle Brown has written an essay, and even though I can't for the life of me fathom why he's sent it in now, there's nothing else to digest at the moment, so here it is: \"Why is the world still refering to the US Mens bball team as the \"Dream Team\"? Here in the US, \"The Dream Team\" refers unambiguously to the one and only Dream Team - the '92 team.</p> <p>All the teams since then have been pretenders. The 92 team was an unbelievable collection of talent - 1992 had the best collection of talent you could assemble from any single year in bball history. There isn't any other year in bball had so many spectacularly good players playing at the same time. By happy coincidence, the IOC openned up basketball to pros, and the rest was history. An amazing team indeed.</p> <p>The current US team isn't know as the Dream Team here in the US, it is universally referred to as the \"Redeem Team\". Most American feel the NBA owes us a better team than it has produced in previous years. It has been hard to recruit some top players and hard to get them to play as a team. It has also been hard to pick a good international team (rules are slightly different in the international game, meaning you need a slightly different selection of players. More outside shooters. Better emphasis on defense. For soccer (er, football) fans, you might think of what kind of team you'd get if you let the dumbest fans pick the team - all strikers, no midfield or defence, and a single keeper. The last two US olympic teams before this one were kind of assembled that way, with somewhat predictable results.</p> <p>And as far as dominance goes, the US women's team has been more dominant. But due to worldwide collective misogeny, they'll get little attention.\"</p> <p>I probably can't officially talk for \"the world\" on this one, Kyle, but I'll apologise on their behalf nonetheless. But if you're going to write that much, at least write \"basketball\" out in full next time. Thanks.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3am:</strong> <strong>Women's triathlon:</strong> Is starting.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.02am:</strong> One and a half kilometres in the swimming section of the women's triathlon, where Britain has Helen Tucker and Hollie Avil going for gold. The former is the World Champion, the latter is 18-years-old and has just passed her A-levels, which is generating more interest among the commentators in the pre-race bluster.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.05am:</strong> Helen Tucker's favourite food is fruit salad, her dog is called Barney and she likes Star Trek. Her fiance is called Marc and her younger sister's name is Harriet, who is also her masseur. She's ampng a shoal of blue swimming hats swimming through the Ming Tomb Reservoir, which is beautiful.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.09am:</strong> Tony Bednall lives in Beijing, but has defied the regime to email this: \"Local Chinese television finally managed to show a brief clip of some of the British victories, to which a beer was downed, tucked in nicely between the Chinese female Judo player winning gold and the Chinese female greco roman wrestling victory. Presumably nobody within the 1.3 billion people living in China is remotely interested in anyone else winning anything.\" The people believe what the people are told. And if you were in Britain, you'd know that Team GB! GB! GB! is currently the greatest in the world.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.13am: </strong>Andrew Jolly has been a stalwart of the minute-by-minute coverage this past week, so it's with a heavy heart I report: \"Back to work today, so unfortunately us Australian residents won't be able to supply you MBM people with an endless supply of e-mail drivel to keep you awake.\" That's a shame. A real shame. \"I would say that over our staff meeting, I did discuss how many more gold medals the Australians are expecting to win - they reckon they are good for three more, two in sailing and one in the triathlon. How are Team GB!GB!GB! looking? One or two in cycling, outside chance in the triple jump?\" That seems about fair. We've also got our Helen (Tucker) going in the women's triathlon right now, and she's the World Champion, so that's another outside-ish chance.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.15am: Triathlon:</strong> No one has made a real break for the lead in this race so far. Our Helen is comfortably in the pack, as is Our Hollie. They're missing some terrific scenery, if only they knew. It's all nature reserves and palaces. Good work, the Chinese architects. And Mother Nature.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3.19am:</strong> This triathlon is slightly different from the norm in that the water they're in is pretty warm, so they don't have to wear wetsuits. That means that they don't have to peel it off when they come up to the bicycles from the water and that should save some seconds. And here they come up the ramp now. The swimming is swum.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>3.21am: Triathlon</strong> Helen Tucker got on her bike in 10th place overall. There's 40km to go on two wheels, and Tucker takes to the lead after less than 1km.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>3.23am: Athletics</strong> As Our Helen takes the lead in triathlon, we're back to the Bird's Nest for the men's 200m heats. Lightning \"Usain\" Bolt will be ambling soon. Right now, the defending Olympic champion Shawn Crawford takes the first heat in a very comfortable 20.61.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3.28am:</strong> Oh, hell. Turns out I've been duped by the television coverage again and while I was watching the triathlon, all this was happening: <strong>Christian Malcolm</strong> and <strong>Marlon Devonish</strong> both qualified from the heats of the 200m and, GB! GB! GB!, Phillips Odowu leapt 17.44m in the triple jump to qualify for the final without any problem whatsoever. I'm really hoping to watch some of that soon, but the nation's broadcaster has cruelly duped this MBM reporter. Not for the first time.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3.30am: Triple jump:</strong> And there goes Phillips. He's like a big red-haired, hop-skip-and-jumping bird as he bounds to that 17.44 mark. You heard it here second. He's through to Wednesday's final with no problems whatsoever.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>3.33am:</strong> <strong>Usain Bolt</strong> comes in second in his heat behind Rondell Sirillo of Trinidad and Tobago. Bolt, of course, does it while carrying an egg and spoon, and with one arm tied behind his back and will confidently expect to do better in the semis. Iceland tie it up in the handball with Egypt. That's 33-33.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>3.38am:</strong> \"Fear not fellow country people!\" declares Julius Caesar, aka Richard Greaves. \"Plenty of life left in the old bulldog yet. At least three more golds in cycling - Victoria Pendleton has hardly taken to the boards yet. We're in with a good shout in both of the triathlons (men's and women's). Plus Track and Field is only just coming to life*<br><em><br>* so in summary that's more possible medals to look for in Cycling and Triathlon.</em>\"</p> <p>Hey, that's a joke I think right there. I like it.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>3.40am: Triathlon:</strong> Nicola Spirig, of Switzerland, makes a mini-breakaway in the triathlon. She's the best biker in the field, so has clearly decided that she's going to need to get herself a decent lead here. That said, Joanna Harrison has just appeared on the screen as the leader, so it's fair to say that I've just lot track. Ah, I get it, they're in two packs and Spirig is in the second pack, I think. Tucker and Avil, of GB, are in 13th and 22nd respectively.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>3.48am:</strong> John Senior and Fergus MacDermot need to look one another up. They're both in Tokyo and both fuming about the Japanese coverage of the Games. \"All I get to see are events with Japan in, and within those usually only the Japanese athletes,\" moans Fergus. \"It's rubbish and very frustrating.\" John says: \"My favourite TV moment so far was yesterday in the women's marathon, when the Japanese commentator announced: \"We apologise to viewers who want to see more of the [dismally disappointing] Japanese runners. We're relying on the international feed, and they tend to mostly show the leaders.\" You want me to share your email addresses?</p> <p>Actually John, don't get me started on the marathon coverage. It was far worse here, far worse. All we got was Brave Paula, who was running with a stress fracture in her leg, and finished 23rd.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>3.50am:</strong> Poor Hollie Avil has a knacked bike in the triathlon, and has stopped. But she's a Brit. On a bike. That's not right.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>3.55am:</strong> Three laps gone, three to go in the cycling section of the <strong>triathlon</strong> and Helen Tucker is in second place by millionths of a second. She's right up there. Bad news in the women's shot put, where Britain's <strong>Zoe Denham</strong> didn't make the qualifying standard, despite throwing it further than the winning chuck of eight years ago. Timing. Always timing.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>3.57am: Triple jump</strong> Onochie \"Larry\" Achike is also into the final of the triple jump. Let's call him Larry. Hollie Avil has mended her bike in the triathlon and is back in the second pack (of two).</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>4am:</strong> Another complaint about television coverage, this time from Pennsylvania: \"I am watching the pommel horse and women's 200m qualifiers,\" says Nick Evans. \"There aren't many people who have anything complimentary to say about the qualities of alcoholic beverages produced in the USA, but I had never heard that time travel was part of the experience.\" American beer. [Shakes head ruefully.]</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>4.03am:</strong> Holly Avil is now out of the triathlon. \"She ran out of gas,\" says the commentator, and follows up with \"She had a stomach upset,\" which earned a snigger here. Helen Tucker, however, is right up there. Kate Bevis is loving Japanese television coverage: \"Last night they interviewed Kosuke Kitajima (100m and 200m breast-stroke gold medallist). The first thing he showed us?- the big zit on his forehead. Apparently it's down to stress and general tiredness.\" Actually, that reminds me. Someone emailed last night to say that the Chinese coverage was blurring out the athlete's belly buttons during the women's marathon. I dismissed it as a wind up, but was that true?</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>4.06am:</strong> The strangely-neglected men's beach volleyball quarter-finals are getting underway. Nope, neither do I.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>4.10am:</strong> The heats of the men's 110m hurdles are starting in the Bird's Nest. We were once a shoo-in for a medal there, what with Colin Jackson and all. Not any more. Meanwhile, the triathletes are still on their bike with about one lap left until they can do it all again on foot. The Brazilian Mariana Ohata has gone out to the front on her own, but Our Helen is in the chasing pack.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>4.14am:</strong> As GB! if GB! by GB! magic GB!, Helen GB! Tucker GB! is GB! in GB! the GB! lead!</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>4.16am:</strong> Wipeout! Massive collision in the triathlon and someone clips someone else's wheel and they all go down like a sack of cyclists. It was the second group, rather than the lead group, so Team GB's hopes remain intact. But some marshalls in white shirts and white caps are suddenly brought into emergency action and kick water bottles off the track with impressive efficiency.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>4.19am: </strong>Dave Hill has just written <em>exactly</em> what I've been intending to write on the subject of biased coverage of the Olympics: \"I think it's safe to say that whatever country you're in when the Olympics is on is purely focused on their own athletes and potential successes and failures. GB! GB! GB! used to be different because we won so little that the Beeb had no choice but to show a wide range of events.\" That's spot on, that, except that I think the Beeb might be even worse than a lot of those other broadcasters. If you'd have seen the marathon yesterday, and the coverage of Radcliffe in favour of everything else, you'd all be hanging Auntie out to dry right now.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>4.21am:</strong> The triathletes are now on foot, with the Australian Emma Snowsill and Andrea Hewitt, of New Zealand, showing a clean quartet of heels to the chasing pack, which includes Helen Tucker.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>4.30am: </strong>Emma Snowsill from, whisper it, Australia, is way out in front in the triathlon and no one is getting anywhere near her. Meanwhile, there's some kind of controversy/nationwide disaster brewing in the 110m hurdles, where the Chinese hurdling sensation Liu Xiang, who is the reigning Olympic and World Champion over the jumps, is, apparently out. He's carrying some kind of knack and won't come out to compete in the heats. Neither will the European champion Stanislav Olijar, apparently, but the Latvian's absence is unlikely to cause a day of mourning quite like Xiang's will.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>4.35am:</strong> Tucker's luck. She's dropped way out of the chase now and is 17th. Boo. Emma Snowsill is miles ahead.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>4.38am:</strong> The American Laura Bennett and the Portuguese Vanessa Fernandes are in second and third place here in the triathlon, with Emma Snowsill already got this one locked up. In the spirit of unbiased British journalism, and with Helen Tucker 17th, the latest men's beach volleyball score is 2-2 in the second game between Holland and Georgia.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>4.43am: </strong>\"Dave Hill's comment [4.19am] is just the kind of level-headed analysis we can do without at the Olympics, thank you very much,\" says leading jingoist John Senior. \"I don't want unbiased coverage; I want hilariously over-the-top Barry Davies-style Team GB! GB! GB! cheerleading.\" OK, here goes: Andy Turner, of GB! GB! GB! is through the heats in the 110m hurdles. (He's a Commonwealth Games bronze medallist, so let's not get too excited, OK.)</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>4.48am:</strong> Just go with this, because it's true. An errant milk float -- possibly driven by a bunch of Aussie-bashing MBM contributors -- has just led Emma Snowsill off the correct course in the triathlon. Really. The Australian, who is more than a minute ahead of everyone else, followed it off the track, before she was ushered back onto the right way.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>4.51am:</strong> China is open-jawed and fuming as Liu Xiang is definitely out of the 110m hurdles. He'd picked up an injury in training, but such was the expectation on him that he came out anyway to try to qualify in the heat. But he couldn't even make it to the first hurdle before he hobbled back down the tunnel. Never mind, it could be worse: Team GB's Allan Scott qualified by finishing fourth. Every cloud, etc.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>4.57am: Triathlon: </strong>Emma Snowsill wins the women's triathlon by a long, long, long way. Britain's Helen Tucker doesn't.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>4.59am:</strong> If you're just tuning in, here's my advice. Don't bother scrolling through any of this: click <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/18/martynrooney\">this shiny hyperlink</a> instead and read Andy Bull's athletics round-up from this morning. The other thing you really need to know is that the Chinese hurdling sensation Liu Xiang did not compete in the 110m hurdles after getting knacked in training. A nation mourns.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>5.06am:</strong> Alex in Sydney has a suggestion: \"Can we petition the IOC to make the triathlon even more exciting by adding a fourth event for example archery, or a gymnastics floor round.\" Triathlon? What triathlon?</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>5.09am:</strong> After a trouncing for Team GB! GB! GB!'s Helen Tucker in the triathlon at the hands of the Australian Emma Snowsill, it's time for any Brits Down Under to find their inner Lithuanian. The Aussies are up against them in the quarter finals of the basketball and are absolutely spanking the Lithuanians 55-29 in the third quarter.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>5.15am:</strong> Repeat. Flick. Repeat. Flick. Repeat. Flick. Nothing on at the Games at the moment, so I suggest you take the time to read this: <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/18/heroic_radcliffe_learns_from_w.html\">Richard Williams reckons Paula Radcliffe can still win an Olympic gold</a><br><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/18/100000_condoms_16500_competito.html\">Marina Hyde has been counting condoms in the athletes' village</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/17/olympics2008.michaelphelps?picture=336676283\">A load of photographers have been taking some photos</a><br>And even though this one is from yesterday, it's still good: <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/17/bulgarias_national_hero_so_goo.html\">Andy Bull grapples with a Bulgarian wrestler</a></p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>5.30am: </strong>You're really not missing anything at the Games (unless you count basketball, in which the Australians are now 75-51 up against the Lithuanians, and we don't count that), so here's this from Anne-Marie Bremner: \"Ok, it was probably excruciating to watch the BBC coverage of Paula's tearful performance yesterday.\" Yes. Yes it was. \"But Dave Hill's right; certainly the Aussie coverage is unashamedly biased to Australia \u2013 and why not? However I did have an urge to write to my MP (if I had one) about the broadcasting of archery (with no Aussies even competing) whilst Team GB! GB! GB! was busily storming towards more cycling medals. Then they had the audacity to show Aussie rules 'football' instead of any Olympics. What were they thinking? Well, words fail me.\"<br>Good news: the Australian basketballers will probably play the USA in the next round, for whom complacency is the only real opponent.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>5.37am:</strong> John Senior is spinning this very well: \"Well done to Emma Snowsill. Another gold for the British Empire! Thanks to Michael Phelps (born in Maryland, thus one of ours) I reckon with about 40 golds we're holding our own against Julius Caesar and Genghis Khan, even though the former has the advantage that Team GB!'s medals count for him as well. We're certainly miles ahead of Napoleon, and, as Barry Davies might have said, 'Where were the Assyrians? Quite frankly, who cares?'\"</p> <p>I'm drinking green and nettle tea. How very Guardian.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>5.42am:</strong> We're watching extended repeats at the moment of the Liu Xiang debacle earlier, and it's more heartbreaking than a hundred Paula Radcliffe marathon hobbles. The Bird's Nest stadium was filled to bursting point with chicks hoping for Xiang to deposit a tasty morsel into their cheeping beaks, but anyone who'd been watching the news wires (which, remarkably, included us here) knew that he'd twanged an Achilles tendon and couldn't compete. Still, he came out, went through a warm-up, all the time crying in pain and clutching his Achilles, and then tried to make it to the first hurdle on what was, in the event, a false start, and he couldn't get there. He limped off down the tunnel and there was all round disbelief in the Bird's Nest, which emptied double quick. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/18/liuxiang\">Here's another way of putting it.</a></p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>5.48am: </strong>I can't detect any irony at all in Will Sinclair's latest dispatch, so I give him the honour of being the first Aussie (knowingly) published today: \"Even as an Australian in Sydney, I'm thoroughly enjoying the banter and Aussie-bashing that has been such a feature of the Guardian's Olympics coverage. Quite frankly, it's about time your lot came to the party and, just like in the Ashes, we're happy for you to have a win every 20 years or so. It keeps things interesting. Best of luck for the rest of the Games!\"</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>5.55am:</strong> Michael Lee has an answer to Liu Xiang's malaise: \"Well, I guess he will be out of favour with the Chinese people/government. Maybe he should pack his bags and ask for political asylum somewhere. We can take him in, just like we took Ms Budd in the 80's. Are there any rules preventing athletes representing more than one nation in different Olympics? Has it been done before?\" Well has it, great, all-knowing MBM readership?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>5.58am:</strong> \"Table tennis! Croatia beat Mexico!\" We're in a slump. \"India have won the toss, and will bat against Sri Lanka. You're up to date.\"</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>6.09am:</strong> A combination of Google, Wikipedia and an email correspondent named Pommie Bastard has come up with the name of Oksana Chusovitina to answer Michael Lee's question from 5.55am. Chusovitina won silver in the vault yesterday and has previously represented Uzbekistan and the CIS at the Olympics, before moving to Germany to get leukaemia treatment for her son and taking up citizenship there, repaying them with gymnastics success. Next!</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>6.19am: Sailing: </strong> Wonderful, some live action. It's the men's double-hander 470 class medal race in the sailing. The Aussies are leading this race at the moment, France are in second, from Argentina and Japan. Great Britain are in sixth.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>6.21am: Sailing: </strong> If it stays like this, the British sailors will finish in third overall and take a bronze medal. The Dutch have it locked up, I think, with France second. These are the words of someone winging it right now, but I'm hoping to pick up a degree of authority as we go on.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>6.25am: Sailing:</strong> Winging it is the order of the day, it seems, as even the Beeb's commentator doesn't seem too sure of what's going on. Apparently, the Spanish boat may or may not be able to catch the Brits for the bronze medal. There's some great graphics on the coverage, mind you. It's like watching virtual racing from Steepledowns, only with boats. And without desperate punters trying to get their fix between real horse races from betting on a computer game.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>6.28am: Sailing: </strong>A helpful Australian correspondent William Sinclair has just piped up with what the television commentators have confirmed: the gold medal in this 470 is already going Down Under. Congratulations Australia. However, that means that <em>this</em> race is all for the silver or bronze and at the moment, Team GB! GB! GB! is gunning for silver. \"To leaven the tiresome Team GB! etc. coverage,\" says Shamini, gutted in Singapore. \"I thought I would let you know that the Malaysian Lee Chong Wei was trounced in the badminton men's final.\"</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>6.33am: Sailing: </strong>\"I'm a little bit worried that Australia are about to overhaul us in the tables,\" says serial MBM contributor Andrew Jolly. \"Especially as they have two sailing crews who are guaranteed gold, not to mention the bloke in the triathlon. If my A-level maths serves me well, that would put them on 12, one ahead of us at the very least.\" That's true, and the Aussies have just officially wrapped up one of those golds in the 470 class. But Britain, it seems, have just got the silver. Nick Rogers and Joe Glanfield are the names.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>6.38am: Nick Rogers and Joe Glanfield win silver in 470 class sailing.</strong> They finish second in medal race, which promotes them from fourth position at the start of the race, to second overall. Australia win gold.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>6.43am: Sailing:</strong> Nick Rogers, silver medallist in the 470 sailing, is \"over-the-moon\" in classic British sportsman vernacular. \"At one point, Nick and I thought we'd lost it,\" said Glanfield. \"Just really pleased that we turned it around and did what we could.\" Gotta love platitudes.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>6.50am: </strong>Will Sinclair and Andrew Jolly need to get a room and have this one out in a big Anglo-Aussie sweat fest: \"I don't think Andrew Jolly should worry too much about the Aussies pulling ahead of TEAM GB! TEAM GB! TEAM GB! (as I understand they're officially known),\" jabs Sinclair. \"I'm sure the British cyclists still have a heap of medals to win in the velodrome. They've already cleaned up in the Riding Fastest In A Line, Riding Fastest By Yourself, Riding Fastest on the Opposite Side of the Track, Riding Fastest On The Same Side of the Track and, most impressively, Riding Fastest Behind A Little Chinese Bloke On A Moped. Surely there are at least a few more of these convoluted events to come.\"</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>6.54am:</strong> Another serial MBM correspondent who goes by the name \"Alex in Sydney (not Alexander Pace)\" has another turncoat Olympian for us, in the form of Australian/Hungarian judo player Maria Pekli, who is making her fifth Olympics appearance. \"In 1992 and 1996 she represented her native country, Hungary, before switching to Australia for the 2000 Games, where she won the bronze medal.\"</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>6.59am: Sailing</strong> The women's 470 race is going to get underway pretty soon, and Australia also have that one locked up before the final race. Shall we cover it? Well, it's done already really, isn't it.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>7.07am: Sailing</strong> Brazil lead Austria in the women's 470 race at the moment, with Holland up there too. Australia are nowhere to be seen, but don't need to be. They've already got the gold. The battle for the silver and bronze is between the Brazilians and the Israelis. The British team has just \"sliced in front of the Italians,\" apparently, and we're reduced to sabotage.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>7.13am: Saling:</strong> I hold my hands up, I'm no sailing commentator. According to someone who is, the Israeli boat now leads the Brazilian boat, with Italy third. Britain are in fifth. Holland are last for the second consecutive race which is, apparently, a \"disaster for Dutch sailing.\" In other sailing, Britain's Nick Dempsey is doing well in the windsurfing and will be a definite medal shout in tomorrow's medal race.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>7.16am:</strong> \"Does anyone understand the rules of sailing?\" wonders Greg Webster. \"I feel like I'm reading the minute by minute on live piracy. Have they hoisted a skull and crossbones yet?\" Not yet, but if the BBC commentator told me that they had, I'd likely repeat it here. It seems straightforward enough: they go up and around a big buoy a couple of times, then the first boat across the finish line wins.

Germany and Spain just sailed into each other, largely irrelevantly.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>7.28am:</strong> Brazil are around the \"top mark\" (a yellow buoy) first, holding off the Israelis. The British team are in third in this race, but can't trouble the medal positions. Holland, however, <em>can</em> upset the applecart, and are up into fifth in this race, which means they could steal the silver. I have a very low expectancy that anyone is interested in this -- don't think I don't know -- but the only other channels I can see are showing repeats of Phillips Idowu's qualifying jump in the triple jump from hours ago, the warm up in the table tennis bronze medal match, and a static ident.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>7.30am:</strong> I've made a decision which will, I expect, empty my inbox for the rest of the day.

The Australian home leg can take place in Earl's Court, the British in a hostel in Brisbane somewhere.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>7.33am: Sailing:</strong> The Brazilians take this race, from the Israelis and the Italians. Australia win the gold (it was already in the bag), Holland take silver and Brazil's win means that they get bronze.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>7.45am:</strong> Some more links have just been added to the top of this article for you to catch up on what's been going on so far. Xiang Liu's injury meant he had to pull out of the 110m hurdles; Helen Tucker missed out by a mere 22 places in her attempt to add Olympic triathlon title to her World Championship; Team GB got a silver in the sailing. Meanwhile, here's Will Sinclair again: \"Can I ask your British readers a serious question?\" Sure. \"Why can't TEAM GB! get their act together and enter a football team in the Olympics? I don't care about the men (who, let's face it, have more than ample opportunity to be bundled out of major sporting events), but I imagine it would be a HUGE boost to British women footballers to have a major event like the Olympics at which to raise their profile. I don't know for sure, but I suspect the answer will have something to do with overpaid, self-important male administrators who are more worried about keeping their seat on the gravy train than encouraging women's football.\" I think it's likely we'll have to have a football team, both men and women, in the London Olympics.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>7.55am:</strong> Another one of those lulls in the action, but some good news for you, better for me, is that Tom Lutz will be here soon to take you to the end of the day.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>8.01: </strong>Here's Tom.

The women's points race is off and we're in the company of Hugh Porter, one of the best commentators on television.

Gold medallist Rebecca Romero is racing for Team Jingoism in this one.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>9.35am: </strong>\"Is there a male/female medal table,\" demands Tom Gurney. \"Who would be winning? And more importantly, how would Queen Elizabeth II's ladies be performing were the medals to be broken down?\"</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>9.38am: </strong>Romero is yet to make an impact, but judging from her interviews she is the most single-minded woman this side of a gestalt, and no doubt she'll run (or cycle) away with it. Vos of Netherlands is leading at the moment, with Romero yet to score.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>9.39am: </strong>Yipes! A huge crash in the cycling, Romero wasn't involved, but a few of the cyclists are down and look like they're staying down.

Vos of Netherlands is winning and looks very comfortable indeed.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>9.53am: </strong>South Korea have won bronze in the men's team table tennis. Well done them.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>9.58am: </strong>\"You've probably watched more of this than me so I'd value your opinion on this,\" starts Matthew West, vastly overvaluing my opinion. \"Has there been an interview carried out with a competitor by a BBC reporter that hasn't made you want to go at your eyes and ears with a fish hook and red hot knitting needle respectively?

They one at the sailing is worst. If I was the Yngling (womens! Not girls! They all look over 18 to me) crew I would have koshed him over the head, bundled him into my boat and dumped him two miles out in the sea.\" </p> <p>Hmmm, yes there are a few rubbish ones, particularly patronising claptrap with (some) women competitors. But anything Chiles discusses is usually top-notch. The best thing about him is he asks questions you want to know the answer to, like how does it actually feel to be punched in the face by an Olympic boxer.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>9.58am: </strong>Vos is pretty much guaranteed the gold now, and unless Romero puts together something amazing, she won't finish in the medals.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>10.05am: </strong>\"Cycling is a religion in Holland,\" lies Hazel Irvine. Vos wins gold for Netherlands in the women's points race \u2013 she was dominant from start to finish - Gonzales wins silver for Cuba and Spain clinch bronze. Yep, that's right I didn't catch her name. <strong>Romero finishes a respectable 11th.</strong> \"Team GB! GB! GB!'s success at these Games can largely be put down to the fact your lot has finally realised you're better off concentrating on those sports with a relatively high number of medals and a relatively low number of competitive nations,\" says Will Sinclair. \"We Aussies have known it for years.

Correct. \"I worry that the 'famous' slope is going to take effect and ruin it all.

It's good to see men being objectified for once. \"It's true that Team GB seems to be playing to its strengths, I feel like there have been several events where medals could have been won if there was a more driving instinct to win,\" says Oliver Pattenden. \"There have been at least four or five medals, if not more, where GB should've placed, and need to do better if they want to stake a claim in the top five or so.\" Hmmm, a bit harsh maybe, but it's true that there have been a few results where there's been a bit of an \"Oh well, it'll be fine in 2012\" attititude as if London is some kind of paradise with trees made of gold medals and grass made out of glory, instead of a city with quite a good bus service.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>10.29am </strong>And Britain's Jason Kenny wins his quarter-final in the men's sprint. In a faster time than Chris Hoy too, although he was pushed harder by his opponent than Hoy. Hugh Porter has a good look at the Dutch cyclist's thighs and gives his approval. Men aren't objects, Porter, I'm beginning to find this demeaning.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>10.33am: </strong>Despite 18 points from Yao Ming, Greece have beaten China 91-77 in the basketball.

My money's on the shifty-looking gardener.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>12.55pm: Hurdles</strong> Britain's Sarah Claxton has made the finals of the 100m hurdles, coming fourth in her semi-final. Bully for her.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>1.02pm:</strong> Stuart Lorkin reckons I'm <strong>in the pub</strong>. \"I have this image of you sitting with a bank of high-definition TV screens in front of you, flicking anxiously between the various red-button offerings to make sure you don't miss that critical table-tennis heat between Croatia and Peru. However, from reading your very welcome summary, I think you're actually just casually watching BBC1 in a local hostelry aren't you?\"</p> <p>I think you'll find I'm watching Diagnosis Murder in my local hostelry, Stuart.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>1.04pm: Athletics</strong> Marlon Devonish and that man Bolt are up now in the first heat of the second round of the 200m as is the USA's Shawn Crawford, who won gold in Athens in this event.</p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>1.06pm:</strong> Devonish looks third.. maybe. It's a photo finish.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>1.08pm: </strong>Usain Bolt strolled home in first after stopping for a cup of tea and a wheeze on a Woodbine halfway through. Crawford followed Bolt's 20.29 with a second-placed 20.42.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> Marlon Devonish is knocked back to fourth by Kim Collins. That's tough, but he can hope to qualify as one of the best losers. <br><strong><br>Oh, the humanity.</strong> Gary Naylor ruminates on the fraigilty of Olympic dreams. \"Hurdling is brutal isn't it?\" he says. I guess so, Gary. \"Susanna Kallur has just hit the first hurdle and fallen out of an excellent medal chance. How many times has she jumped over a hurdle in her life? Tens of thousands of times. But when it mattered... Cruel.\"</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>1.15pm:</strong> For those of you following my jingoistic coverage of the women's 100m hurdles, Sweden's Susanna Kallur was one of the favourites for a medal but she fell and didn't finish her heat. Which is awful. But it did give our girl Sarah Claxton a shot at glory instead.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>1.15pm:</strong> Britain's Christian Malcom also finishes fourth in his 200m heat with a time of 20.30, That puts him in a strong position for the final. Tense times for his team-mate Marlon Devonish, who finished in 20.43. There will be four places for the fastest losers and Malcolm and Devonish are currently in first and third positions for those slots.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>1.24pm: Men's Long Jump</strong> Britain's Greg Rutherford fouls on his first jump. Curses.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>1.28pm: Men's 200m heats</strong>Antigua's Brendan Christian wins the third heat of the second round, but the good news for Marlon Devonish is that the fastest loser, Poland's Marcin Jedrunski, is behind him in 20.58.</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>1.31pm: Men's 200m heats</strong> Ireland's Paul Hession is in the final heat here.....</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>1.32pm: Men's 200m heats</strong> ...and he makes the semi-finals with a really strong finish. Joining him will be Devonish, Malcolm, Usain Bolt, reigning champ Michael Crawford and Team USA's Wallace Spearmon, who looked uneasy as he came in second in his heat. Also a bunch of other fast chaps.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>1.41pm:</strong> In an unforeseen turn of events, the Guardian mainframe has been beset by technical issues.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>1.45pm: Gymnastics</strong> Unparallelled coverage of Beth <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/18/tweddle\">Tweddle's </a>near miss in the uneven bars final earlier.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p><strong>1.46pm: Women's Pole Vault</strong> One of the competitors has had her pole stolen. Well, she may have misplaced it, but that wouldn't be such a good story.</p> <!-- Block 174 --> <p><strong>1.50pm: Women's 400m Hurdles</strong> An emotional Tasha Danvers of Team GB has just made the final. Having reached the same stage at the Sydney Games, she returns to an Olympic final after taking two years out to have a child.</p> <!-- Block 175 --> <p><strong>1.55pm: Women's 400m Hurdles</strong> Danvers ran in 54.31, second to the USA's Sheena Tosta in 54.07. She can take confidence from that display, but Colin Jackson reckons reaching the podium would be a tall order for her.</p> <!-- Block 176 --> <p><strong>2pm: Pole Vault</strong> Still trying to find out what happened with the missing pole here. In the <strong>Long Jump</strong> Greg Rutherford has not been doing so well. Hes currently in 11th place after two no-jumps.</p> <!-- Block 177 --> <p><strong>2.02pm: Men's Long Jump</strong> Rutherford's in the last chance saloon...</p> <!-- Block 178 --> <p><strong>2.03pm: Men's Long Jump</strong> ....aaaagh. He gets the white flag, but 7.84m won't be enough to keep him in contention.</p> <!-- Block 179 --> <p><strong>2.07pm: Men's 3000m Steeplechase Final</strong> In the interests of objectivity, I should let you know that this event is curently starting. Kenyans Ezekiel Kemboi and Richard Kipkemboi Mateelong are expected to make it nine wins in this event for their country.</p> <!-- Block 180 --> <p><strong>2.07pm: Men's 3000m Steeplechase Final</strong> Sweden's Mustafa Mohamed is the non-Kenyan upstart here and he's making the early pace. Kemboi is the reigning Olympic champion in this event,</p> <!-- Block 181 --> <p><strong>2.07pm: Men's 3000m Steeplechase Final</strong> It's all very cagey at the moment with three laps to go. Mustafa still leading.</p> <!-- Block 182 --> <p><strong>2.17pm: Men's 3000m Steeplechase Final</strong> World Champion Brimin Kipruto wins for Kenya. That was a thrilling finish, Mahiedine Mekhissi threatened to take gold for France, but the Kenyans have this one locked down. Kemboi fell away in the end, but his compatriot Mateelong took bronze.</p> <!-- Block 183 --> <p><strong>2.23pm: </strong>The official Beijing Olympic Games website keeps crashing my computer. Which is inconvenient given that I am covering the Beijing Olympic Games.</p> <!-- Block 184 --> <p><strong>2.32pm: </strong>I have taken my powers of destruction to a new computer, so fingers crossed. The Beeb are reliving the joys of Athens 2004 with 800m Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes. And in a remarkable coincidence, the <strong>Women's 800m</strong> is about to start.</p> <!-- Block 185 --> <p><strong>2.34pm: Women's 800m </strong>Kenya's Pamela Jelimo is the name to watch here, says Steve Cram. And who am I to argue with him?</p> <p><strong>Pole Vault Update:</strong> \"That Brazilian pole vaulter might want to check that she even had it with her; Brazil's customs officials aren't noted for their fondness of pole vaulters poles, having once sawed the famous Sergei Bubka's pole in half looking for drugs,\" Gavin Cook reminds us.</p> <!-- Block 186 --> <p><strong>2.39pm: Men's Long Jump</strong> A rueful Rutheford. \"I had massive high hopes and I know what I can jump,\" said Greg. \"I was expecting a medal and I've probably just lost my best ever chance of getting an Olympic medal. I could feel the pressure a lot and I thought I could deal with it. It's a wasted opportunity.\"</p> <p>They're off in the 800m...</p> <!-- Block 187 --> <p><strong>2.40pm: Women's 800m</strong> Jelimo leads in under world record time..</p> <!-- Block 188 --> <p><strong>2.42pm: Women's 800m</strong>Jelimo is well ahead...she's starting to tire...but the margin is just too big for the rest of the field.</p> <!-- Block 189 --> <p><strong>2.42pm: Women's 800m</strong>This is an incredible story. Jelimo only came to the event in April and she's now the Olympic champion. In fact, she is the <strong>first ever Kenyan female Olympic gold medallist</strong>. Oh, and she's just 18.</p> <!-- Block 190 --> <p><strong>2.46pm: Women's 800m</strong> Jelimo's winning time is 1:54.87mins, the fifth fastest ever and the junior world record. Dame Kelly is most impressed. Her Kenyan team-mate Janeth Jepkosgei Busienei is second in 1:56.07mins and Morocco's Hasna Benhassi takes bronze in 1:56.73.</p> <!-- Block 191 --> <p><strong>2.52pm: Women's 800m</strong>The charming Gavin Margetson has e-mailed to let me know how much superior our coverage to the BBC's. Modesty prevents me from publishing the text, but I must admit that when it comes to <strong>Equestrian Jumping</strong>, they were right and I (and my old nemesis the Beijing Olympic Games official website) was wrong. The USA have taken gold, Canada silver, Norway bronze and GB nowhere.</p> <!-- Block 192 --> <p><strong>2.52pm: </strong> My apologies: I checked the official schedule earlier and it was listed for tomorrow. Those sneaky devils at the BOGOW have now changed it, without owning up to their error. Rebranded Website is sent to the stand in the naughty corner, while the real culprit puts on its innocent face and produces an apple for teacher.</p> <!-- Block 193 --> <p><strong>3.03pm:</strong> Anyhoo, Team GB didn't do so well and there is some actual sport happening in Beijing, without any pesky horses in the way.</p> <!-- Block 194 --> <p><strong>3.04pm:</strong> It's the <strong>Men's 400m Hurdles</strong> Final</p> <!-- Block 195 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> Great win for Angelo Taylor in 47.2secs. USA! etc.</p> <!-- Block 196 --> <p><strong>3.07pm:</strong> Taylor proves he is the jumpiest and fastest of them all, eight years after he won the same event in Sydney. And it's silver and bronze for Kieron Clement and Bershawn Jackosn in 47.98 and 48.06 respectively. Clean sweep 1-2-3 for the USA.</p> <!-- Block 197 --> <p><strong>3.09pm:</strong> That's the athletics pretty much done for today but there is <strong>Boxing</strong> coming up.</p> <!-- Block 198 --> <p><strong>3.09pm:</strong> It's Britain's David Price against Lithuania' Islam Turnuriev in the <strong>Men's Super Heavyweight </strong>quarter-final.</p> <!-- Block 199 --> <p><strong>3.11pm: Bronze for Britain</strong> At least.</p> <!-- Block 200 --> <p><strong>3.17pm: </strong>Price's opponent has thrown in the towel at the beginning of the second round. That guarantees the Liverpudlian a bronze at least. The pundits are suggesting that he woud not want to win in such a manner but to be honest Price doesn't look too upset from where I'm sitting.</p> <!-- Block 201 --> <p><strong>3.20pm: </strong>Price was looking good at 3-1 up after the first round bu the Lithunanian looked in a lot of discomfort and clearly couldn't continue. </p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>South Africa</strong> have just won their first medal of the Games as Khotso Mokoena takes silver in the men's long jump. They'll be dancing in the streets of Cape Town tonight. And also in large stretches of suburban north London.</p> <!-- Block 202 --> <p><strong>3.20pm: </strong>South Africa will have hopes of a second medal on wednesday when Natalie du Toit, the swimmer with a leg amputated at the knee takes to open water. Natalie is th first ever paralympian to compete in the main competition.</p> <!-- Block 203 --> <p><strong>3.28pm: Pub chat</strong> Who is the greatest? Is it Michael Phelps, struggling back to Blatimore with a chest full of gold? Or is it Usain Bolt, who was so dominant in the 100m that he looked like an errant father taking part in the kiddie's egg-and-spoon? </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/poll/2008/aug/18/olympicsathletics.olympicsaquatics\">Vote</a> now. </p> <p>And hurry up about it.</p> <!-- Block 204 --> <p><strong>3.34pm: Pole Vault</strong> Russia's Yelena Isinbaeva has set a new world record with 5m 5cm. That breaks her own record by 1cm, which she set last month in Monaco. </p> <p>John Davis lives in Brisbane, the poor lamb. \"As a merseysider living in Brisbane, I've obviously had to take a break from my thriving Ute Hubcap business to try and watch Dave Price, Unfortunately the Aussie media is treating any British success by closing their eyes, sticking their collective fingers in their ears shouting \"la la la la\" and pretending its not happening. Is he a genuine chance for gold ?\"</p> <p>If he's in the semis he's got a genuine chance Jim, but he's not one of the favourites.</p> <!-- Block 205 --> <p><strong>3.41pm:</strong> Some results:</p> <p>In the <strong>Men's Long Jump</strong> Irving Saladino of Panama took gold with a best of 8.34m in the fourth round with Khotso Mokoena of South Africa second with 8.24m and Cuba's Ibrahim Camejo claiming bronze with 8.20m, just 4cm more than Rutherford's qualifying leap. </p> <p>In the <strong>Women's Pole Vault</strong> Yelena Isinbaeva took gold with a record leap of 5.05 metres at the third attempt.<br>Jennifer Stuczynski of the United States took silver with a leap of 4.80m, while Svetlana Feofanova took bronze with 4.75m on countback from compatriot Yulia Golubchikova.</p> <p>The US have beaten China in <strong>Baseball</strong> 9-1. But China are still ahead in the medal table with 39 golds and 67 total to the Americans' 22 and 72.</p> <!-- Block 206 --> <p><strong>3.47pm:</strong> We'll leave it at that for the moment folks, but we'll keep you updated during the afternoon. Check back in tonight for reports, blogs, the football quiz and more live Olympics coverage from 1.30am . Tomorrow is a bg day for Brits in the <strong>Triathlon</strong> and obviously <strong>Cycling</strong> and <strong>Sailing</strong> too.
