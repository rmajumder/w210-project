It was all very appropriate: she talked about aliens, dolphins, good, evil, Viagra and being green - not in an alien way but a political way. It was good. She mostly made sense, and she was charming and funny.<br> Then we went to Angelo's pawnshop to get a sense of whether or not business is spiking because of the wheels coming off the economy. The fellow who owned the place was cagey, slick and very self-actualised, and refused to acknowledge any frame of his business as being predatory or sad - not even the frame that was hanging high on the wall around a painting of Fleetwood Mac from the Rumours period.</p> <p>He said none of the things in the store were sad or had stories of desperation behind them. He said, \"It is what it is: stuff.\" I say it was sad stuff. </p> <p>I asked him whether, knowing there is nothing he can do about the desperation that brings people here, and providing a service that is necessary while knowing it's all over, he had to have the conscience of a cancer doctor. He wouldn't have it. He was chipper and positive and a little creepy-confident.<br> I almost bought a whale-tooth Billiken. He didn't even know what it was; well, I didn't know what it was called myself until I Googled it, but I knew what it was. I lived in Alaska for two years when I was a kid. I bet if you asked Sarah Palin what a Billiken was, she would actually know that one. Maybe. Now I am in Las Vegas, at the Luxor, the pyramid. It might as well be as old as the Egyptian pyramids it was based on because it is a bit sad and nasty. <br>Not that all Vegas isn't sad and nasty, but some hotels do it right. </p> <p>This place is tired. The strip is empty. And the cabbies, clerks and all the casino people I talk to say it is really slow. You'd think people would want to invest on the tables: it's the only way you can see exactly how and where your money is being gambled away. Cut out the middlemen, such as the government, brokers and bankers, put it all on a red, and watch that wheel spin.<br> <br>I won $200 playing blackjack and went with my producer to buy big steaks at the Palms hotel. Then we went downtown, where what is left of the original Vegas still serves the real gamblers \u2013 the desperate, who don't even aspire to some stupid, cool, romanticised idea of what Vegas is or was. They are here to gamble. They are here to put it on the line. </p> <p>It seemed downtown was packed because these people aren't tourists; these people are in it to win it, because we are all losing. Downtown Las Vegas at the precipice of a global depression was desperate but electric with creepy, empty hope. I did my part: I lost a hundred bucks and wanted to get it back but walked away. Strong.<br> <br>I am here for one more night, though. Shit.</p>",
  "<p>Men of the north, hang your heads in shame. Spot checks on commuters have revealed that the further north men live, the dirtier their hands.</p> <p>In Newcastle, swabs of men's hands revealed more than half were contaminated with bacteria normally found in faeces. </p> <p>The percentage of the unclean fell with latitude, with 34% of Liverpudlian men testing positive for faecal bacteria, 21% in Birmingham, 15% in Cardiff and 6% in London.</p> <p>The findings are part of a study by scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine into the nation's hand-washing habits, which was designed to highlight how infections can easily be spread by people failing to observe basic rules of hygiene.</p> <p>Researchers approached 409 commuters waiting at bus stops outside major train stations in the five cities. Swabs of their hands were sent back to a laboratory, where any bacteria on them were grown and identified.</p> <p>\"When we first saw this north-south divide we scratched our heads. We thought it might be something to do with the way we did the tests, the weather, or the time it took to get the samples back to the lab, but the issue is with the men, not the women, so it must be a difference in behaviour. The best I can think of is that men in the north are too tough to wash their hands. We need to investigate it more, it's puzzling,\" said Val Curtis, director of the school's hygiene centre.</p> <p>Overall, 28% of people who agreed to a swab tested positive for faecal bacteria, such as <em>Enterococcus</em>, <em>E coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em> and <em>Panteoa</em>. The types of bacteria rarely cause serious infections, but their presence has alarmed scientists none the less.</p> <p>\"I was expecting to find around five to 10% of people with faecal bacteria on their hands, so I was flabbergasted at the number. It means people aren't washing their hands after using the toilet, that they are contaminated and leave their bugs on surfaces where other people pick them up,\" Curtis said.</p> <p>The study, which is preliminary and has yet to be published, found that female hygiene was more consistent than that of males. On average, 27% of women had faceal bacteria on their hands, with Londoners again the cleanest at 21% and Liverpudlians the dirtiest at 31%.</p> <p>The study has been released to coincide with <a href=\"http://www.globalhandwashingday.org/\">Global Handwashing Day</a>, a public-private partnership set up to promote hand washing with soap to reduce diarrhoea and other infections in developing countries. </p> <p>\"These bugs just shouldn't be on peoples' hands. If someone has a pathogen in them, such as <em>rotavirus</em> or <em>Salmonella</em>, this is a superhighway for passing it around to the community,\" Curtis said. \"Just rinsing your hands under the tap doesn't remove bacteria, because they tend to get stuck in any dirt and grease you've got on your hands.\"</p> <p>The study found that people who used the bus were nearly twice as likely to test positive for faecal bacteria than train commuters. Bacteria can live for two to three hours on surfaces after being touched by a contaminated hand.</p> <p>Worldwide, around 1.9 million people die from diarrhoea every year. In Britain, an estimated one in five has an episode of diarrhoea each year.</p> <p>Mike Catchpole, director of the Health Protection Agency's Centre for Infections, said: \"Hand washing is one of the most important ways of controlling the spread of infections, especially those that cause diarrhoea and vomiting, colds and flu. <br> \"Global Handwashing Day serves as a timely reminder that people should always wash their hands after using the toilet, before eating or handling food, and after handling animals. And remember to cover all cuts and scratches with a waterproof dressing.\" HPA figures suggest that cases of <em>norovirus</em>, the winter vomiting bug, are rising and that the annual <em>norovirus</em> season is likely to have begun already. <em>Norovirus</em> is the most common cause of gastrointestinal disease in the UK,with the number of cases peaking between October and March. Between 600,000 and a million people in the UK are affected each year.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday October 16 2008. In the article above we stated that: \"Worldwide, around 1.9 million people die from diarrhoea every day\". We meant to say, every year. This has been changed.</p>",
  "<p>Some of the world's largest financial institutions have either expired or been put into intensive care in recent weeks, but one bank in particular is bucking the trend. Europe's biggest social bank, Triodos, whose mission is to \"make money work for positive social, environmental and cultural change\", is thriving. Its most recent half-year results show a healthy growth in balance sheet and profits. \"Credit crunch bypasses Triodos\" was the bank's simple top line message to shareholders. </p> <p>In global terms, it is a minnow - at least, compared to the financial leviathans that are now looking so sickly. The group's total balance sheet was \u20ac2bn in June 2008. Its UK balance sheet stands at around \u00a3317m. But when credit is scarce, and voluntary sector finances are taking a pummelling, Triodos is preparing to step up its investment in charities and businesses with socially and environmentally sustainable goals.</p> <p>Charles Middleton, Triodos UK managing director, puts its success down to a \"sound\" model of banking: operating in the \"real\" economy (and avoiding complex financial instruments like derivatives); eschewing high levels of debt; taking a long-term view and resisting pressure for short-term profit maximisation. Until recently all this might have been regarded as unfashionable and staid. But as Middleton says, without a whiff of triumphalism, \"sustainable investment has worked\" for Triodos.</p> <p><strong>The alternative economy</strong></p> <p>The list of Triodos UK's investments - and it prides itself on its transparency in who it lends money to - reads like a who's who of the alternative economy: wind energy companies, organic farms, housing co-ops, arts projects, fair trade shops, social care charities, social businesses, even Buddhist centres. It financed the first containers of Caf\u00e9direct coffee to arrive in the UK in 1990, and 14 years later raised \u00a35m for the company through Britain's biggest ethical public share issue.</p> <p>Not so long ago its mission would have been dismissed as hippy idealism, or derided as a conscience-salving luxury affordable only for middle-class customers who did not need to chase the higher rates of financial return available on the high street. But its double bottom line approach - using depositors money to make a profit by investing in businesses which create a positive and sustainable social and environmental impact - is now looking like a model of how mainstream banking might adapt.</p> <p>There is no outward sign of the hippy or the radical in Middleton. Grey-suited, discreet and undemonstratively groomed, his background is firmly establishment. At 18, when he went off to train as an army officer, he was apolitical. His understanding of social justice came gradually, through his life experiences - on the streets of Belfast during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and subsequently, as a banker with Barclays in India and Africa, volunteer work with homeless children in Mumbai, and with HIV-positive people in Botswana.</p> <p>Those experiences \"challenged me to think about how the world works and how we as individuals can influence it,\" he says. \"I have always been completely in awe of what individual people have been able to achieve. Moving to Triodos gave me the opportunity to take some of that experience and use it to work with inspirational people and businesses in the UK. They've shown me that there really is a different way to do business that is sustainable and fun.\"</p> <p>A \"different way to do business\" is a theme that emerges again and again through the interview. Triodos's strict approach to investment - its promotional literature declares that it \"only lends to organisations that actively do good\" - may seem pious, but it is also a shrewd, as well as enlightened, approach to risk. There's a rigour to the way it sizes up business loan applicants - \"If it was just an opportunity to make a lot of money out of something vaguely environmental, we would not be interested,\" says Middleton - that these days seems eminently sensible.</p> <p>Middleton says he is as surprised as most people at the scale of the crisis in the banking industry, but not shocked that the Triodos model has so far weathered the storm. Its sustainable approach to lending is matched by a governance structure that guards its mission and independence, and prevents volatile speculation in its shares. Middleton won't say how much he is paid - though it is almost certainly less than Triodos Group chief executive, Peter Blom, who earned \u20ac209,000 in 2007. Wage differentials are miniscule by banking standards: the salary of the highest remunerated Triodos UK employee is no more than seven times the salary of the lowest-paid employee. The collective reward scheme in the UK typically pays out a flat rate bonus of \"hundreds of pounds\" to each employee.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, there has been a recent upsurge of interest in Triodos from customers, bankers and policy makers, which Middleton welcomes, though he is anxious to emphasise it is not the only model: \"There should be a greater focus on different banking models, including our own, when the immediate concerns about many of our banks have been addressed.\" </p> <p><strong>Social responsibility</strong></p> <p>Changing the culture of an industry will not happen overnight, accepts Middleton. But the trauma suffered by the banking system will see a reassessment of banking fundamentals, he believes. Why shouldn't pressure from customers, shareholders and regulators - not to mention younger, more environmentally aware employees - force a recalibration of what the big banks mean by corporate social responsibility (CSR) and how they might integrate it into their core business? </p> <p>Not all banks may feel comfortable copying the Triodos mission statement (one part of which is to \"help create a society that promotes people's quality of life and that has human dignity at its core\") but in future it will make business sense, suggests Middleton, for banks to, say, make it a condition of a loan that the recipient reduces their carbon footprint. He is frustrated by the conventional CSR practice in which a bank gives 1% of profits to good causes: the social impact of this is paltry, he argues, compared to what could be achieved through a bank's loan book.</p> <p>Triodos has not been entirely unaffected by the downturn: the recession will mean tough times for many of its customers, says Middleton. But they tend to be less profit-driven, more resilient, less loaded with debt and not so exposed to the volatility of the markets. A tightening of consumer belts may affect the market for organic and fair trade produce. </p> <p>But amid the gloom, there are opportunities for growth, says Middleton, in sustainable social care, housing and renewable energy businesses. \"These are the core social and environmental issues,\" he says, \"that in the long-term affect all of us.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.triodos.co.uk\">triodos.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 51.</p> <p><strong>Lives:</strong> Bristol.</p> <p><strong>Status:</strong> Married; three children.</p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Harrow school; Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst.</p> <p><strong>Career:</strong> 2003-present: managing director, Triodos Bank UK; 1980-2002: various management and director posts with Barclays bank in India, the Caribbean and Africa; 1976-80: Officer, British army, serving in Germany and Northern Ireland.</p> <p><strong>Interests:</strong> Photography; travelling; chair of the Haller foundation, an environment charity.</p>",
  "<p>Even before the Icelandic bank collapse last week, the credit crunch had increased uncertainty among charity leaders about the economic prospects for the voluntary sector, a survey published today reveals.</p> <p>Close on three-quarters of charity chiefs surveyed thought that conditions were bound to worsen for the sector over the next year, and confidence in their own organisations' future had dropped from 45% to 23% in six months. </p> <p>The results are contained in the latest quarterly charity confidence survey, taken in August by the National Council of Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) and are based on 210 responses.</p> <p>Some 90% of respondents said they are increasingly less confident about the financial future of the UK economy, compared to 70% in February 2008. Only 12% have faith that government policies will improve the operating environment for their charity. Despite this, only 8% of charity leaders plan to lay off staff in the next three months, and 61% plan to increase expenditure.</p> <p>Stuart Etherington, NCVO chief executive, says the survey points to anxiety about the UK economy filtering through to charities. He says: \"In previous charity forecast surveys, it seemed more likely they thought the general situation was bad but that their organisation would weather the storm. Now it appears they are more worried.\"</p> <p>NCVO has teamed up with the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo), Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) and the Charity Finance Directors' Group to collect details about members that have lost money as a result of the collapse of Icelandic banks. As many as 99 charities could lose more than \u00a3230m, according to the website of Icelandic bank Kaupthing, Singer and Friedlander. The charity coalition will present its findings to ministers next week in the hope of securing government cover for the losses.</p> <p>The Charity Commission has also asked charities with deposits in Icelandic banks to come forward. A survey it released yesterday shows that one in five charities that deliver services have seen an increase in demand, while more than half of the 500 respondents reported increased costs in energy, food and travel.</p>",
  "<p>For each loser there is a winner and, as Banco Santander continued its drive into the Anglo-Saxon market by picking up US-based Sovereign this week, it is clear which side the Spanish bank thinks it is on.</p> <p>Santander, which holds 10% of deposits in Britain's high-street banks, snapped up the remaining 75% of Sovereign that it did not own for only $1.9bn (\u00a31.1bn).</p> <p>\"The winner takes all,\" Santander's chief financial officer, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Alvarez, told a conference last week, as he explained his bank's policy of buying while the market was in crisis.</p> <p>Santander, he said, was planning to \"add value by rescuing falling banks at attractive prices\". It would become part of a group of strong banks, he predicted, that would grow at the expense of the weak. </p> <p>The US bank requested a takeover last week as the global financial crisis hit what may prove to have been its lowest point. Santander is now buying Sovereign shares - which will be paid for with its own - at almost a fifth of the price at which it bought a quarter of the bank in 2006.</p> <p>With its purchase of Alliance &amp; Leicester, picking up Bradford &amp; Bingley's 200 branches and Monday's $1.7bn cash injection into its Abbey subsidiary, Santander has used the crisis to become a major player in Britain. Only Lloyds TSB and RBS hold more deposits in the UK.</p> <p>A long-cherished desire to enlarge its profile in the US is now being realised. Little surprise, then, that the Spanish bank is feeling and sounding smug. It is rooted in a strictly regulated Spanish banking system that has avoided the worst of the sub-prime fallout. It is the eurozone's largest bank in terms of market value and the world's largest by branches, thanks to a vast Latin American presence.</p> <p>While losers have concentrated on the risk-laden ploys of the back office, Santander has built a front office network that engages directly with the real economy. With what it claims is a strong balance sheet and low risks, Santander has watched the comparative value of other banks slide or tumble.</p> <p>The Sovereign deal is so cheap that some analysts see it as virtually risk-free. A Caja Madrid analyst, Javier Bernat, said: \"There's always a risk to an acquisition such as this but, thanks to a clean-out in the US, it's less than it might have been.\"</p>",
  "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer is to start selling heat and light alongside slippers and underwear as part of a new deal with Scottish and Southern Energy.</p> <p>Shoppers will be able to buy gas and electricity in stores and online and will get rewards, in the form of M&amp;S vouchers, for signing up, renewing their contracts and cutting their power consumption.</p> <p>SSE said M&amp;S Energy customers will pay the same price as its existing customers who take both gas and power and who pay by direct debit - \u00a31,196 a year for an average user.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for M&amp;S said the idea was to take the confusion out of buying gas and electric: \"As a business we buy a lot of energy ourselves. It is complicated, so we are going to give people a choice they know they can trust. The service will also enable customers to reduce their energy consumption and their bills.\" </p> <p>The new energy offer is part of a push by M&amp;S to start selling a wider range of goods and services and to expand into new areas. The retailer now sells a range of electrical goods and is trialling branded foods in 19 supermarkets in the north-east.</p> <p>It is also expanding its international division, and two weeks ago opened its first store in China - in Shanghai.</p> <p>In the UK, however, M&amp;S is facing increasingly tough trading conditions. Chairman Sir Stuart Rose recently reported a 6% downturn in sales and announced he was slashing planned investment to save cash. City analysts expect the company's profits to slump from \u00a31bn last year to little more than \u00a3500m next year. </p> <p>SSE, which ranks second behind British Gas among the big six in the residential energy market and has around 8.5 million customers, aims to use the link with M&amp;S to grow its market share. \"It is a new channel to reach additional customers,\" an SSE spokesman said. \"We want to continue to grow. We expect to continue to grow.\"</p> <p>SSE has committed to secure electricity generated by hydro-electric plant to match that used by M&amp;S Energy customers. </p> <p>The power company already has around 1,400 megawatts of hydro generation and is close to completing a scheme that will add another 100MW.</p> <p>The M&amp;S Energy offer rewards customers with a \u00a315 voucher if they reduce their annual energy usage by 10%. Customers who opt for paperless billing will get another \u00a310 voucher.</p> <p>Dual-fuel customers switching to M&amp;S Energy will also receive a \u00a320 M&amp;S voucher on signing and a further \u00a310 voucher for each year they remain with M&amp;S Energy.</p> <p>The energy deal goes online and into 16 stores on October 27 and will be extended to 62 stores by the end of next month.</p> <p>The M&amp;S spokeswoman said meter reading, bad debt collection and disconnections would be handled by SSE, which has set up a specialist M&amp;S customer service team: \"They are sector leaders when it comes to service. They reflect our brand values.\"</p> <p>Carl Leaver, director of International, Home &amp; M&amp;S Direct, said: \"M&amp;S Energy is an exciting addition to our range of services. The energy sector can be quite complex and we want to make it simpler for our customers. We also understand that the cost of living has risen for many customers and we hope to encourage them to save money by reducing their energy usage.</p> <p>\"Our partnership with Scottish and Southern Energy is based on our shared commitment to offer great-value products supported by excellent service. Together we've developed an extremely competitively priced product that will help M&amp;S Energy customers to help the environment.\"</p> <p>Alistair Phillips-Davies, SSE's energy supply director, said: \"I am confident that our partnership will deliver a market-leading product ... It shows energy supply in this country is constantly evolving with new products, services and ways of communicating with customers.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is 2.30pm on a weekday afternoon. Sunlight filters through the willow oaks and beech, descending from a perfect blue sky. Beneath the trees, rows of marble headstones stretch away, seemingly without end, rising up green, closely cropped slopes towards the house of perhaps the American civil war's most famous general, Robert E Lee. There is a stillness here that envelops everything, a silence that demands respect.</p> <p>Then suddenly, without warning, a rifle volley thunders out, then another, and another. A bugle sound Taps, the US army's equivalent of the Last Post. In a separate part of the vast Arlington National Cemetery, another American hero is being laid to rest with full military honours.</p> <p>But in Section 60 of the cemetery, it is quiet. Here is where many of the more than 4,100 men and women killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom are buried. It is a work in progress. Newly filled graves await headstones. Vacant lots await fresh occupants. Casualties of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan are now being buried here, too. There is plenty of room left.</p> <p>Section 60 has been called America's saddest acre. It may also be its most forlorn. Because it is here that the extent to which the US has begun to turn its back on a conflict that defined a presidency and divided the world can be measured.</p> <p>As far as many Americans are concerned, it seems that Iraq has become a forgotten war. Some believe, along with the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, that \"victory\" has already been won. For others, the war feels like a painful memory, a subject best not discussed.</p> <p>In the presidential election campaign, surveys show only 8-9% of Americans rate Iraq as the most important issue. Economic worries, healthcare, energy prices and taxes have all taken precedence as the global financial crisis bites.</p> <p>In last week's presidential debate between Barack Obama and John McCain, Iraq was barely mentioned. The Democrat has set a 16-month timetable for withdrawal. The Republican says that is defeatist. \"I will bring our troops home in victory and honour,\" said McCain.</p> <p>But the watching audience, judging by instant graph lines measuring their reaction, did not want to know. Iraq is a distraction from their real concerns. Iraq is a turn-off. And in Section 60, that leaves a hurtful question hanging in the warm, still air: what was it all for?</p> <p>Michael Gainey, a staff sergeant who returned from a year's tour in Iraq in December, firmly believes his friend and fellow serviceman Russell Shoemaker, who was killed by a roadside bomb in Salman Pak, south of Baghdad, on May 24 2007, did not die in vain. Gainey has come from Charlotte, North Carolina, to visit Shoemaker's grave.</p> <p>\"Russell would have thought it was worth it. He made an impact. He fulfilled his mission,\" Gainey said. \"Russell was a real great guy. We were involved in training the Iraqi police. </p> <p>\"The day he died he was going to a meeting with local Iraqis. We couldn't train them properly. It was a combat zone. But I think we helped.\"</p> <p>Gainey said he was not surprised the public appeared to have lost interest in Iraq. \"Iraq's off the agenda,\" he said. \"Americans have got complacent. They've got used to it. It's not on the TV so much. And the situation there is better than it was. It's right that people are focusing on their pocketbooks. I understand that.\"</p> <p>His views were echoed by a female US army colonel who had also come to Section 60 to honour fallen comrades. She asked not be named.</p> <p>\"Americans have been desensitised to Iraq,\" she said. \"We've been at it now for seven years in the war on terror. I think many people just shut it out. Americans are still very supportive of our troops. That doesn't necessarily mean they support the policy.\"</p> <p>According to her father, a second world war veteran, people were thinking too much about their own problems. \"The attitude has changed quite a bit since the war started,\" she said. \"You've got to protect your own country. But there are too many soft-hearted people. There's too much greed.\"</p> <p>Recent surveys confirm a sharp falling-off in political support. Asked last month in an ABC News/Washington Post poll whether the Iraq war had been worth fighting, 61% said \"no\" while 36% said \"yes\". Fifty-eight percent of respondents told Gallup that the whole thing had been a mistake; while 59% told the Associated Press in September they wanted a timetable to bring the troops home.</p> <p>Sitting on the grass by the grave of his brother, Captain Ian Patrick Weikel, who was killed in Balad, north of Baghdad, in April 2006, Chad Weikel believes that America's unique sense of mission to improve the world must not become a casualty of Iraq.</p> <p>Weikel, from Colorado Springs, believes this so strongly, he has signed up to go to Iraq, following in his brother's footsteps despite his wife's opposition. </p> <p>\"I joined [the army] because of my brother. I wouldn't be doing it otherwise. Whether people support the war depends on party lines. I'm surprised they're not more interested. But people don't get the real picture of what we're doing over there,\" Weikel said, shielding his eyes from the sunlight.</p> <p>\"It's my brother's birthday today. He's 34 today. He was always awful at birthday presents. He'd buy crappy gifts or else he'd forget. I've been talking to him about that. I talk to him a lot. But he never really answers back.\"</p>",
  "<p>Turn the clock back 12 years. The love affair between the third sector and New Labour was in full swing, and Labour was limbering up to deliver what has proved to be a major transformation of the relationships between the sector and the government. </p> <p>Building on the 1998 Compact, we have seen a flowering of initiatives that have strengthened and developed our sector: capacity building, capital investments through Futurebuilders, the establishment of the Office of the Third Sector, and a minister for the third sector - the first such in any government worldwide. Most important of all, the championing of service delivery through the sector has led to significant growth in jobs and the role we play in shaping responsive, citizen-focused services. </p> <p>The UK is now the global leader in sector-government relations. Other countries seek to emulate our lead with their own compacts and third sector ministers.</p> <p>But has Labour's affair with the third sector run its course? Most charity observers at the recent Labour and Conservative party conferences have commented on the stark contrast between the two. You would have been hard-pressed to catch a mention of the third sector at Labour's conference in Manchester, yet in Birmingham there was not one Conservative policy speech that did not laud the role of the sector in promoting a better society. </p> <p>I sat through the crime debates at both conferences. Not one word from justice minister Jack Straw on the sector. By contrast, shadow minister Nick Herbert talked at the Conservatives' conference about the sector's role in tackling \"the causes of crime\", and there were even two sector leaders on the platform. </p> <p>Is Labour now resting on its laurels, thinking it has done enough? Has the government addressed yesterday's challenges so well that it is being slow to grasp what the sector needs ministers to do today? The value of a partnership can be judged in testing times, and that is exactly what the third sector now faces. Demand for our services is rising as the social consequences of recession start to kick in. Inflation means our costs are up. At the same time our income is threatened - and, with the banking collapse, so are our savings. </p> <p>At times like these, we want to know that the government is ready to support us. The Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo) is holding a conference next month on the impact of the economic downturn on the third sector, and I have invited both Alistair Darling and George Osbourne to speak. Do they understand the difficulties charities are facing, and are they ready to support us through the tough times ahead? </p> <p>To date, we've had little indication either way. You will have heard about support for small business, for ailing companies and banks. But so far no word on what government will do for the third sector. </p> <p>We need the government to safeguard the money of charities that had deposits with Icelandic banks. And we need a heavy injection of capital into the sector to enable us to continue supporting the growing numbers of victims of the recession. Acevo has called on the prime minister to establish an emergency fund of at least \u00a3500m for that purpose, but we also want urgent reform of Gift Aid, because around \u00a3700m is lost every year to charities as a result of a system that is clearly in need of change. </p> <p>Labour has achieved much. But that was then. This is now. Charities face a bleak future. Will the government be there to support them? Or is the affair over?</p> <p>\u2022 Stephen Bubb is chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo)</p>",

Market failure has been compounded by brain failure of the discredited profession of economics, overwhelmed by journalistic wish-fulfilment and glee.</p> <p>The banks have not been \"nationalised\", just deluged with money. They remain pluralist and competitive institutions, with independent boards. Their workers are not civil servants. Investors retain their shares. The bonus culture will revive. The impresarios of greed have been punished, or at least a few of them. But this is not socialism in our time, just public money hurled at the face of capitalism.</p> <p>Guardian writers and Labour politicians have been drooling all week over what they call the \"collapse of the free market model\" of a modern global economy. They are simply wrong. All markets required regulating. It was regulation that failed last month, not the market economy. When a car is driven too fast and crashes it does not invalidate motoring.</p> <p>For the record, exactly the same gloating was heard after the crash of 1987. It too \"spelled the death of market economics\". As Martin Taylor, formerly of Barclays, said on the radio yesterday: \"Yes, people will return to old-fashioned banking - until they forget about what has happened.\" Then the game will start all over again. Business can do without most things, but not private banks.</p> <p>In a seminal encounter in the early 1980s, the late Nicholas Ridley was trying to persuade a reluctant Margaret Thatcher of the virtue of privatisation. She feared she would lose control over such key industries as oil, gas and electricity. Ridley pointed out that it was far easier to command the heights of the economy by statutory regulation than by public ownership, which was encumbered by trade unions and Treasury control. Thatcher was persuaded, and the age of Oftel, Ofgas and Ofcom was born.</p> <p>The one that got away was the City. Hence the fiascos at BCCI, Lloyd's, Barings and Black Monday. Hence too what happened when the new building society/banks, encouraged by Thatcher and her successors to this day, went potty over homeownership. Britons were told that house-buying was the sensible way to save. Ministers would declare the \"right to homeownership\" and demand that \"every young person be helped on to the housing ladder\".</p> <p>Nobody cared how much this might impoverish them, or who lent the money or how, provided ministers could take credit for soaring homeownership. Nobody even cared when the negative-equity crisis burst in 1991.</p> <p>I carry no torch for the recklessness of the bonus culture, but it is politicians, not bankers, who should be apologising for the housing bubble. As for the bonus-drenched BBC constantly demanding that bankers \"say sorry\" for bonuses, words fail me. And its bonuses are not even earned.</p> <p>The toxic housing loans that were the cause of the credit crash will take time to bleed out of bank balance sheets. But bleed they will.</p> <p>Provided politicians can be restrained from re-hyping the British and American housing markets, the system will return to normal. Taxpayers will then get their money back, as shares are sold in tranches when the market suits. This is state \"greenmailing\", albeit on a grand scale, as was done with British oil shares in the 1980s. Governments will have performed their proper function in easing market adjustment after the bursting of a bubble.</p> <p>How quickly this works will depend on how far ministers show they understand banks. The toxic loan scandal began with politicians mesmerised by house-buying. MPs even expected taxpayers to pay their own mortgages for them. Mortgage splurging became so politically correct that nobody dare associate it with loan sharkery.</p> <p>On Monday Brown demanded that the banks in which he now has an interest stop paying dividends and bonuses, and return mortgage lending to its 2007 level. This was the surest way both to send bank shares through the floor and to revive the sub-prime chaos. Lady Vadera, the minister for economic competitiveness and small business, then added to the confusion by wanting the banks only \"to maintain the same level of marketing and availability\" of their mortgage offers. What does that mean? </p> <p>Brown's purpose in aiding the banking sector should be simply to guarantee a revival of reputable borrowing, not to pick and choose. Forcing banks to eschew commercial decisions and make bad mortgage loans will drive them back to dodgy derivatives. The arrival on the scene of Vadera, author of the chaotic nationalising of Railtrack, is hardly inspiring. These people have failed the whelk-stall test too often for comfort.</p> <p>All this has nothing to do with the death of capitalism, rather with its resuscitation after a nasty accident. As every student of economics knows, capitalism depends on confidence, and confidence depends, in the final analysis, on power. Belatedly, governments are feeling their way to honouring this responsibility.</p> <p>But we should repeat the cause of the crash. It was British and American politicians who encouraged people to buy houses they could ill-afford. They duly acquired assets that would, in most cases, be realised not by them but by their children. In the rest of Europe these people would be renting their homes and saving in a safer and more liquid fashion.</p> <p>The first round of let's-play-banker by Brown and Vadera this week suggests that this housing madness is far from cured. We should therefore expect that its message will again be forgotten and the sickness eventually return.</p> <p>Though bankers are more fun to blame, it was politicians whose laxity and craving for popularity lay at the root of the present trouble. They should at least be denied any triumph for aiding its cure.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday October 17 2008.

  "<p>Governments in Europe and North America now wield enormous power over big finance. This time last year, Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling were struggling to prevent Northern Rock from being nationalised; such was the stigma attached to state ownership. Today, nobody bats an eyelid when the Treasury takes a 60% stake in RBS or when the Bush administration takes an equity stake in Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>Clearly, policy-makers never really wanted to be in this position. The UK government said in the middle of last week that its aim was to purchase non-voting shares in British banks and had no desire to put people on boards. That view changed when the markets collapsed on Friday and Whitehall had more control over the commanding heights of the economy than it has had for 30 years.</p> <p>The question is what to do with this influence. Some measures look like no-brainers: the government should appoint a wider range of stakeholders, including customers and workers, to bank boards to ensure that there is no return to the clubby, you-scratch-my-back world of supine oversight by ineffective non-executive directors. It seems obvious, also, that the government should insist on a more sober and conservative model of banking. Ministers send out the wrong signals when they say they want lending to business and consumers to return to 2007 levels: it was lax lending that got us into this mess in the first place.</p> <p>This, though, is an opportunity for global as well as domestic reform. In the past, any efforts at cracking down on tax havens, for example, has been stymied by the knowledge that the US and the UK were reluctant to play ball. One of the unintended consequences of the crisis is that it has legitimised coordinated global intervention. There is the chance to make finance once again the servant of the public, which is as it should be.</p> <p>One obvious reform is to introduce a tax on international currency transactions. This idea has been knocking around since US economist James Tobin first suggested it in the early 70s, but the lack of interest in Washington and London has meant it never gained traction. </p> <p>Set at a lower level it would raise considerable sums of money. If a levy of just one basis point (one hundreth of 1%) was placed on all currency deals, governments would find themselves with an additional $70bn a year. At a time when they are chucking vast amounts of taxpayers' money at the banks, that would be a nice little earner, and might help assuage the concerns that the public are going to pay for the folly of financiers.</p> <p>There are alternative uses of the cash, of course. In Washington at the weekend, Britain's international development secretary, Douglas Alexander, said that the needs of poor countries should not be forgotten simply because the developed world had problems of its own. He was right, but inevitably the cost of bailing out the banks will put a strain on public finances in the west and tempt countries to scale back on development pledges. A currency transaction tax set at 2 basis points, assuming no evasion and no impact on trading volumes, would be enough to ensure that all the UN development goals were met by 2015.</p> <p>The second benefit of a currency transaction tax is as a calming measure during a crisis. Tobin didn't really envisage his tax being used as a revenue-raising device. Rather, he saw it as a way of slowing down the speculative movements of capital that can destabilise economies. There would be no chance of doing so with a levy set at one or two basis points; for that a two-tier scheme would be needed, with a modest impost in normal times and a much higher tax when times get tough. The question of when a problem becomes a crisis should not worry policy-makers. As the past month has shown, when you are in one, you know it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Consider two propositions. First, avoiding climate catastrophe could require cuts in carbon emissions of as much as 80%. Second, deforestation accounts for 17% of the total. The upshot is obvious. Unless we somehow safeguard the forests, the carbon savings needed elsewhere could entail virtually shutting down the fossil fuel economy. Yesterday a government-commissioned review by the businessman Johan Eliasch spelled out this steely logic. It made an overpowering financial case for investing in the world's arboreal lungs.</p> <p>A few weeks before a UN climate summit is due to start thrashing out the outline of a replacement for the Kyoto protocol, Mr Eliasch proposes adding forestry to the mix. He hacks his way through a thicket of facts and figures to argue that we could halve the costs of fixing the climate if carbon markets gave credit for preserving trees. Mr Eliasch is not alone. The Stern review pinpointed rainforests as one of the cheapest ways to keep a lid on global warming. Only last week, EU-funded analysis concluded that more wealth was draining away in fallen forests than in the banking crisis.</p> <p>The simple economic argument is, however, overlain with unusually tricky politics. Giving carbon credits for conservation should help tropical countries. But coupled to continuing pollution in the west, the scheme could be seen as outsourcing moral responsibility. When Europeans have cleared woodland since the iron age - and grown prosperous in the process - the global south might detect hypocrisy in being bribed not to do the same. Mr Eliasch himself, a wealthy one-time Tory donor, was in the past charged with green colonialism, after buying tracts of forest to stop it being cleared. His efforts to find local people alternative work were genuine, but did not assuage his critics.</p> <p>Together with generous funding, Mr Eliasch's new emphasis on giving countries a free hand in devising the best way to protect their forests might, perhaps, wash away such political objections. There are, however, other problems with translating carbon trading theory into practice. Unless every forested country is part of the scheme, it risks relocating the problem - restricting the supply of timber or feeding land in one part of the world increases the rewards for providing it elsewhere. The woeful state of governance in forested countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo also makes enforcement hard to achieve. </p> <p>The obstacles are formidable, but Mr Eliasch's basic case is unanswerable. An old English custom, some say, allowed only the collecting of firewood that could be grabbed by hook or by crook. The world's forests, too, must now be protected - by hook or by crook.</p>",
  "<p>Liverpool, said Phil Redmond in the first of a series of free-ranging thoughts for the day on Radio 3, is not fully integrated into the UK. Well, that's one way of looking at a city that very few outsiders can get their heads round, even outsiders as close as Manchester - 40 miles away, but worlds apart. \"We are who we are, and that's it,\" says Redmond, in his familiar shaggy-haired, take-it-or-leave-it style.</p> <p>But does he really believe the myths, those created by the city itself and those imposed on it from outside? \"I think the perceptions of the city are perceptions in themselves - mythology is a mythology,\" he adds gnomically. Explanations on a postcard, please.</p> <p>He is much clearer when he suggests that if you land anywhere in the world and say you are from Liverpool, responses will be 99.99% positive, that the nasty bits of the mythology emanate from London. He's probably right. This may be a gross libel, but most London-based news managers assumed that Liverpool's year as European capital of culture would be a great scouse cock-up. They also predicted disaster for the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, and they got that wrong, too.</p> <p>There were certainly chaotic elements in the run-up to 2008 in Liverpool: an artistic director who came and went; a public row between the leader of the city council and the Liverpool Culture Company's chief executive; the Mathew Street festival fiasco (much of the 2007 event was cut back on health and safety grounds); and worries over a funding shortfall. Things were not looking good.</p> <p>But with nine months gone, the year now seems to be doing fine. Here's just one statistic: 557,000 people visited the Tate Liverpool gallery between June and August - a 200% increase on last year.</p> <p>So let's the put the boot into London, which, Redmond claims, is where the negativity starts. \"It's not London, and therefore it's going to be second rate; it doesn't matter what it is, and it doesn't matter where it is. I keep counselling people and saying: 'Don't get too upset - they treat everybody like that.'\" As he tells national newspaper journalists, up for the day from the capital: \"Look, at the end of the day, the thing you have got to understand is that we don't care. The average guy or woman out on the street, they actually don't care what London thinks because they are busy getting on with their lives.'\"</p> <p>That's the London thing sorted. But what about the Liverpool difference? Don't all those cranes, apartments, bars and the huge shopping centre that is Liverpool One suggest that Liverpool has woken from its long sleep of decline to join the regional renaissance? Hasn't it belatedly followed the lead of Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle-Gateshead, cities that decided to stop lamenting that they were not London and start shouting about their own specialness? That, in this year of culture, Liverpool is not as different as it likes to think it is?</p> <p>Redmond turns to history to explain why, to him, the difference is clear. A century ago, he points out, Liverpool was the centre of the world because 50% of the world's trade came through its docks. People made their money taking commission on that passing trade. \"That's what developed the scouse entrepreneurial, looking-for-the-angle, worth-a-try mentality,\" he argues. \"The freewheeling, free-spirited buccaneer. Not a care for authority.\"</p> <p>But there was also insecurity because citizens never knew when change would come. \"What you then get is a demand for social justice that comes out in very rigid union and health and safety things. People want to be treated with respect and dignity and looked after.\"</p> <p>Those two very different traits create the tension in the scouse character, and explain why they are not Brummies, Mancs, Tykes or Geordies. Liverpool's intellectual capital is its people.</p> <p>Which brings us back to capital of culture. Ask Redmond what has been the best event of the year so far, and he answers: \"The last one. Every time I stand up to speak, I say, 'This is one of the greatest highlights of the year, until tomorrow night, when there will be another one.'\"</p> <p>He raises a fond smile for That's What I Call Culture, the talent show that brought more than 1,500 hopefuls to the city's new Echo arena. But rather than spend time weighing up the relative attractions of conductor Sir Simon Rattle against the tall ships, which were watched by a million people, Redmond is thinking about 2009 and far beyond.</p> <p>\"People are now beginning to get hold of the project and are starting to wonder what they can do with it and where we go next,\" he says. \"The big question on everybody's lips is legacy, and there are four separate groups now flowing out of the city council looking at all this, in terms of structure and bureaucracy. They are not actually looking in terms of what has been achieved, which is the renewed confidence of the people. It's not about bureaucracy and structures; it's about taking the confidence of the people and letting them keep it. It's about reminding them that they can do things of their own accord, that they can work collectively, can do what they have always done.\"</p> <p><strong>Not into bureaucracy</strong></p> <p>Redmond is now increasingly speaking for Liverpool - as the late Tony Wilson did for Manchester - and has been appointed chair of National Museums Liverpool. But he insists he does not want to become mayor; as he says, he's not into bureaucracy and structures, but very much into that overused word, empowerment. \"Not everything has to go through the public purse, and people should not expect local politicians to do everything for them.\"</p> <p>Last Thursday, he was at the premiere of Of Time and The City, the new film about the Liverpool in which director Terence Davies grew up 30 or more years ago. \"That looks back to a level of community engagement that people took on themselves,\" Redmond says. \"They didn't expect the council to organise street parties or firework displays. They did it.\"</p> <p>Later generations were much more worried about their jobs, and abdicated community responsibility. There's a whiff here of a complaint about the nanny state. But the positive thought is that if the people of Liverpool can gain confidence, they can start building a new economy and help alleviate the city's poverty.</p> <p>\"We are not going to get major manufacturers coming here,\" Redmond says. \"That's just fiction. People talk about a new knowledge economy, but it's really a question of plugging into the cultural economy, and Liverpool has always punched above its weight in that.\"</p> <p>You can see why culture and this year are so important in Redmond's vision for his own city. He became particularly vocal and visible when he took over as deputy chairman of the culture company last September and promised a bit of \"scouse edge\". The people of the city heard the voice of someone they trusted, one of them.</p> <p>In the last quarter of 2007, optimism grew, and a kind of certainty came on January 11 when, with Ringo Starr bizarrely imprisoned in a shipping container on the roof of St George's Hall, the year officially began, cheered on by a crowd far bigger than anticipated. Redmond recalls: \"The defining moment was to stand in that crowd and see them all smiling, to stand and get your hand shaken as they all walked away saying, 'Well done, lad.' That's what I get everywhere I go. People stop me and they just say, 'It's great. Thanks.'\"</p> <p>Perhaps this is scouse romancing again, a new mythology. But as far as Redmond is concerned, it's a sign of the growing strength he wants to see. \"I want to try to continue some of the work we have done in terms of building confidence, building networks, and letting people thrive.\"</p> <p>He seems to have few fears about the impact of the world economic chaos on the city's rebirth: shopping and entertainment are big part of the local economy, and are not going to go away.</p> <p>So perhaps the culture year will give Liverpool a new start: the old myths and cliches will fade away, with even London beginning to acknowledge that the old stuff is no longer quite right.</p> <p><strong>Cultural strategies</strong></p> <p>Liverpool has changed. Public agencies - police, fire service, health bodies, Mersey Travel - now have their own cultural strategies. \"But without the badge of authority of capital of culture, there is a danger that they will then retreat into their own silos and that their own pressures will distort what they do in terms of cultural delivery,\" Redmond warns. \"So I want to hang around a little bit longer, just to keep encouraging people to realise that you don't have to be proprietorial or interventionist, or whatever, in culture. You just need to keep that environment going.\"</p> <p>If nothing else, the culture year has reminded Britain, the world and Liverpool itself what culture the city has, and what - with the Museum of Liverpool rising at the Pier Head - is still to come. \"This city has got so much that we scousers take it for granted,\" Redmond says. \"We've forgotten what we've got.\"</p>",

She would be answerable to the chief executive, and could find herself working with a range of other agencies, including utility companies, education authorities or primary care trusts. It is a job that would put her at the cutting edge of planning and partnership working, and she would earn \u00a345k-\u00a350k. </p> <p><strong>3. </strong>Working for a regeneration organisation or a development agency as a development manager is another possibility for Pearl. It would be a gamekeeper-turned-poacher role, as she would be using her knowledge of how the local planning system works in order to help her new employers achieve their regeneration objectives. The post would give her the opportunity to develop negotiating skills and partnership working. The salary is \u00a345k-\u00a350k.</p> <p><strong>4. </strong>The charity sector is an option for Pearl, although her salary might fall slightly.

  "<p>French attempts to craft a global warming pact to make the EU a world leader in tackling climate change are gridlocked, with governments unable to agree on how to share the pain and costs of slashing greenhouse gases by 20% within 12 years.</p> <p>A European summit tonight in Brussels will fail to agree on the means to the end of meeting the EU's ambitious targets, warned diplomats and officials.</p> <p>The deal has to be struck by the end of the year for the package, which was agreed unanimously by European governments 18 months ago, to become European law.</p> <p>But senior officials and diplomats doubt whether that will be possible despite the fanfare that accompanied the unveiling of the policy last year. </p> <p>\"The targets have been agreed and we have presented them all over the world,\" said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European Commission chief. \"There will be a real problem of credibility for Europe.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Saving the planet is not an after-dinner drink, a digestif that you take or leave.

The energy and climate change secretary, the foreign secretary's brother, Ed Miliband, last week failed to get the rest of the EU to exempt the aviation sector from a central element of the climate change package - that which obliges Europe to obtain 20% of its energy mix from renewable sources by the 2020 deadline.</p> <p>Sarkozy's effort to build a consensus has already seen him scale back his ambitions, according to sources. But he has still encountered a wall of insuperable opposition on several fronts.</p> <p>The heart of the plan is the so-called emissions trading scheme which forces European industries to buy permits to pollute, encouraging them to save money by becoming cleaner.</p> <p>But amid furious objections, particularly from Germany, Sarkozy has proposed that especially energy-intensive industries such as the steel, aluminium and cement sectors be awarded their pollution permits for free to prevent them abandoning Europe and moving their business elsewhere. Britain and others reject the blanket exemption for these sectors. </p> <p>However, there is also widespread concern that Europe will simply export jobs and businesses without making any difference to carbon dioxide emissions.</p>",
  "<p>Phil Bloomer of Oxfam comments on Shell's global emissions and the emissions from our oil sands projects in Canada (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/10/renewableenergy-energy\">Letters, October 10</a>). Unfortunately, he has not compared figures in a like-for-like manner. As he points out, Shell is one of the few companies that reports broadly on emissions, including the emissions from the use of our products. But the emissions that we are directly responsible for, ie from the operations at all our refineries, oil and gas production platforms and oil sands mines around the world (in 140 countries) were 92m tonnes in 2007, which is equivalent to about one-sixth of UK emissions. Our oil sands investments contributed direct emissions of 2m tonnes in 2007, together with a further 1.6m tonnes in electricity-use-related emissions.</p> <p>Emissions including the use of our products is expressed in a so-called wells-to-wheels calculation. In Shell's case in 2006, that is 847m tonnes globally. And since Mr Bloomer uses that figure to compare with the UK's emissions, he should, in fairness, also have used it in the comparison of emissions from the end use of oil-sands fuels with emissions from the end use of fuels from conventional oil. On that basis, emissions from oil sands are about 15% higher than from conventional oil.<br><strong>David Hone</strong><br>Shell Group climate change adviser</p>",

  "<p>The massive government interventions announced on both sides of the Atlantic in the last 48 hours may, just, have prevented the world's financial system from imploding. Alongside the largest monetary meltdown in half a century, we face collapsing consumer and business spending. These problems are closely intertwined - the financial crisis is part of the cause of the collapse in spending, and the collapse in spending is now undermining financial markets - but they need separate (and yet non-conflicting) solutions. </p> <p>To get a handle on these problems, start on the financial side and two big \"facts\" about banking and money.</p> <p>First, since the emergence of modern capitalism some three centuries ago, we have seen more than 30 major financial crises - about one every 10 years. But this is an average. In the UK, we've had more than 30 years since the last banking rescue (the secondary banks in 1974). One result was a growing belief, now shattered, that banking could be left largely to the private sector. </p> <p>In the US, the ideology of the unfettered market is more deep-seated. Despite the collapse and rescue of Continental Illinois in 1984, despite the savings and loans crisis of the 80s, and despite the rescue of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, the US clung, until the last few weeks, to the belief that the banks could largely be left alone. Nevertheless, economic history is clear: banking systems almost always eventually over-extend themselves and have to be rescued - not just the Brits and the Americans, but the Japanese and the Latin Americans in the early 80s and then the Scandinavians, the south Asians and the Russians in the 90s. </p> <p>Secondly, money is not like cars or cups of tea - you cannot test-drive or taste it. It depends, above all, on trust and confidence which cannot be bought or exchanged. Money is the bedrock for the whole economic system. If you are to avoid catastrophe when confidence evaporates, as it has done in the recent turmoil, the only option is for the state to underpin the core financial institutions. </p> <p>These two facts are the reasons we are where we are today. Faced with meltdown, the chancellor's dramatic actions on Monday (followed by the US and Europe) are exactly appropriate: inject liquidity into the markets, provide guarantees to the inter-bank market and, above all, inject public capital directly into the banks by the purchase of their shares. But why not also match the commitments made by others for 100% security for personal deposits? This is an area where, now that the government has acted with credibility, the greater the promise, the less the cost!</p> <p>Do taxpayers here and in the US need to be worried about the scale of this intervention? Hardly at all. The bank shares governments are buying at these depressed prices will almost certainly prove to be a bargain. When the Scandinavians did the same, the public purse made a gain. Moreover, as the chief secretary to the Treasury, Yvette Cooper, has said, the scare-mongering about the scale of government debt is based on the fallacy that this is \"spending\" just like buying the services of a teacher or a doctor. It is not, it is a financial investment. The talk of tax rises is also irresponsible. It causes people to be yet more fearful and to spend less, increasing the spiral downwards towards major recession.</p> <p>That recession (or the shortage of global aggregate demand) is the elephant in the room. Its origins lie in the huge imbalances in the world economy, resulting from our credit-driven consumption in the west having filled the vast hole in demand that would otherwise have been left by high levels of Asian (especially Chinese) saving. As we in the west stop spending, the only way to avoid a global recession is for the Chinese, especially, to spend more. So far there is no sign of this. Would they cooperate if asked? Not necessarily, but they hold such vast dollar reserves (around $2 trillion) that they have a massive incentive to help stop the US economy and its currency descending into chaos. At the global and aggregate demand level, as well as in terms of future global financial stability, the Chinese are an essential part of the solution and it is extraordinary that the G7 or G8 groups do not include them. They should be invited immediately.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the current financial crisis, its reminder of economic history, and the differences between finance and the rest of the economy, make two further points imperative. One is that every major bank has to have the state standing behind it. This has been known for ages but, shockingly, was forgotten in the case of Iceland. We now need international agreement that countries with a small tax base must either run banks that are commensurately small or must get their banks underwritten by international bodies such as the IMF. The second is that financial regulation has to be approached with a completely different mindset from that for the rest of the economy. Elsewhere, competition can be a substitute for regulation. In banking, the opposite applies: the greater the competition, the greater the need for regulation and/or supervision. </p> <p>The twin results - the growth and influence of China, plus a more regulated and state-financed banking system - make it inevitable that the Anglo-Saxon model of unfettered capitalism that has dominated thinking for half a century will be much diminished. What will replace it is unclear, but it may well look more like a form of state capitalism - perhaps not full-blown, but something much closer to Chinese capitalism than would have seemed conceivable just a month ago.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Graham is an economist and master of Balliol College, Oxford <br><a href=\"mailto:master@balliol.ox.ac.uk\">master@balliol.ox.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<h2>Inside job on airports</h2> <p>That stern defender of the environment, the Woodland Trust, has been debating on its website the expansion of Stansted airport and its impact on ancient trees. The postings have generated a lot of controversy, with heated debates between pros and antis. But some names kept turning up, posing as concerned members of the public. And, as one sharp man from the trust noticed, they were using similar language to letters backing expansion. Some elementary research has revealed that all come from a computer address registered to none other than BAA - the former British Airports Authority. </p> <h2>Charles goes Greenpeace</h2> <p>Further signs that Prince Charles has become a republican anti-capitalist prepared to throw himself in front of the bulldozers and go to prison for his beliefs. His new deputy private secretary is Benet Northcote, currently chief policy adviser to Greenpeace UK. On the other hand, it could be a sign that Greenpeace is now the new establishment.</p> <h2>Over-energised MPs</h2> <p>Portcullis House is that extremely ugly office block for MPs, built six years ago with the promise that it would use just a third of the energy required by a similar-sized prestige office block. Oh, yes? A parliamentary question from Peter Ainsworth, the Conservative environment chap, shows that it is actually consuming about 400 kilowatt hours per square metre - more than four times what was envisaged. Ainsworth is angry: \"It was supposed to be an example the rest of the country could follow, and instead it's an embarrassment.\" </p> <h2>Urbane Jane </h2> <p>Eco Soundings worries that the new farm and environment minister, Jane Kennedy, has spent so long living in cities and working at the Treasury, the Department of Health, the Department for Work and Pensions, and the Northern Ireland Office that she may not recognise the countryside at all. Young Jane is MP for Liverpool Wavertree, and has spoken eloquently in parliament about difficult journeys on the A1. But beyond saying her hobbies are training dogs, there is little to link her with the natural world. More information, please!</p> <h2>Lost in Defra</h2> <p>Ms Kennedy will have to get to grips with Defra's unique way of handling things. On Monday it was revealed that the department had lost 122 laptops, five digital cameras, one fax machine, various car parts from official vehicles, a whole set of laboratory equipment, and a toaster. Even more worrying is that the department seems to have lost 20,979 cows.</p> <h2>Personal hot air</h2> <p>Now that younger brother Ed is ensconced as Britain's first secretary of state for climate change, David Miliband feels safe to return to his truly revolutionary project: personal carbon allowances. \"The basic idea is simple,\" enthuses David in an interview in this month's Prospect magazine. \"Every citizen gets a personal carbon allowance. If they use up less carbon than their allowance, they can sell the excess to those using more electricity, gas or petrol.\" If this makes it anywhere close to a policy, remember you heard it here first ... well the second time round.</p>",

He said there would need to be a more ruthless focus on reducing costs.</p> <p>The board has been under intense pressure to raise its margins, most notably from the US activist investor Nelson Peltz, who has suggested that Cadbury margins lagged way behind competitors such as Hershey's and Wrigley. This gap has since reduced, but pressure on Cadbury remains. </p> <p>This month Cadbury's finance director, Ken Hanna, announced he was to quit the group, becoming the third boardroom director to depart since the arrival of Carr, who signalled his intention to shake up the management structure soon after his arrival.</p> <p>In a further sign of his determination to stamp his strategic vision on the business, Carr has changed the regional reporting structure, devolving authority from four global hubs to seven and stripping out 250 senior managerial posts in the process. </p> <p>A further 330 factory and supply chain jobs are to go in Australia and New Zealand as Cadbury pares down the varieties of sweets and chocolate bars it sells in those markets, simplifying the production process.</p> <p>Cadbury said it was 60% of the way towards reaching cost-saving targets that were crucial to achieving its goal on margins.

  "<p>For David Salt, a 47-year-old laboratory manager at a clay factory in Stoke-on-Trent, the global financial crisis hit home at 11.40am last Thursday.</p> <p>Gordon Brown had just appeared on TV to explain the Treasury's bail-out package for British banking. The stockmarket was plunging again, and house prices had fallen a record 13.3%. It felt like the financial system was in freefall. </p> <p>And, at a job centre in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Salt signed on for the first time, joining the growing ranks of Britain's unemployed and receiving \u00a360.50 a week in jobseeker's allowance.</p> <p>\"That's when it hit me. You could tell the staff were just going through the motions,\" he said. \"They took my details and got me to sign the paper. You're just another number really. </p> <p>\"I looked around at the queue and thought: God, is this really what it's come to? Then they search a 30-mile radius for suitable vacancies. There was nothing.\"</p> <p>The trail of fallen dominoes that culminated in the father-of-two losing his \u00a331,000 salary ended on the afternoon of September 23, when managers at Castle Clay factory called him into the boardroom to say he was in the unlucky half of the workforce that would not be needed the following day. Salt collected his belongings, sent his wife, Georgina, a text message, and drove home. </p> <p>\"David was conscientious, good at his job,\" said Castle Clay's director, Chris Rhodes. \"But it was a case of slimming down or the company goes to the wall. The phones had stopped ringing about six weeks earlier. No calls. No sales.\"</p> <p>The towering piles of bricks at a stockyard 60 miles south of Stoke-on-Trent explain why the phones stopped ringing. It was here, at Baggeridge brickworks on the outskirts of Kidderminster, that 75,000 tonnes of red-burning clay would be delivered each year to turn into bricks.</p> <p>The old hands in the Baggeridge plant, some of whom have made bricks all their lives, have a saying: if the piles of bricks are stacked so high you can only see the tips of the trees at the end of the yard, there is trouble on the horizon. For several months the view has been just bricks, stacked 20ft high.</p> <p>Baggeridge's owner, Wienerberger, the world's biggest producer of bricks, has concreted over a quarry and rented a depot in a bid to find room for the surplus bricks. There are 70m bricks stacked at the Kidderminster plant, where 71 employees, half the workforce, were made redundant last month.</p> <p>It is the same across the industry, as fellow brick manufacturers Ibstock and Hanson have mothballed factories and dispatched staff to scale down production, which last month dropped to its lowest level since 1945. </p> <p>Salt's fate is tied to the 1.2bn bricks that have been stockpiled by Britain's three main brick producers - enough to construct a city the size of Nottingham.</p> <p>But the chain that led to the towers of abandoned bricks leads, in turn, to construction sites across the country. It was around May that almost every major house-builder, all of which are supplied by Wienerberger, started freezing construction. In many cases, homes and apartments were left half-built and wrapped in plastic, with diggers standing idle nearby. </p> <p>By the end of the summer, the number of private new-build projects being started had fallen by 76%, according to the National House-Building Council.</p> <p>\"People stopped buying houses,\" said Noble Francis, economics director of the Construction Products Association. \"There is an inextricable link between mortgage approvals, and transactions, and then new-build construction projects. If people can't get mortgages, they don't buy houses, there is less demand for housing, so new houses don't get built.\"</p> <p>Business was booming at Castle Clay this time last year, when TV newsreaders began talking about the knock-on effect of the US sub-prime mortgage crisis. No one in the factory thought their fate was tied up with US mortgage lenders.</p> <p>But it took one year for the credit crunch to travel the 44 miles from the Birmingham branch of Northern Rock, where queues heralded the start of the UK's financial downturn, to the factory floor on Podmore Street.</p> <p>For Salt, the timing could not have been worse. One daughter, Joanna, 20, is mid-way through her university course and the second, Kathryn, 17, is scheduled to start next year. \"We made the decision that we wouldn't let the girls leave university with debt. I'm not sure how we're going to do that now. We've got savings, but those were supposed to be for holidays and retirement.\" Then there is the mortgage on the couple's three-bedroom detached house in the suburban town of Trenton.</p> <p>The whole family has cut back on expenditure. But the redundancy has hit Salt's esteem, too. </p> <p>\"When your youngest daughter who works at a hotel restaurant during the evenings brings in more money than you're getting from the dole, your pride takes a bit of knock.\"</p> <p>Sat alone at home with, by his own admission, not much to do, Salt believes that banks offering unrealistic credit are ultimately responsible for his job loss. </p> <p>That makes the bail-out even more painful, he says.</p> <p>\"The government is pumping all these billions into financial institutions so they can lend us money again. Can't they give me a few hundred quid so I can retrain on a computer course?\"</p> <p>\u2022 Additional research by Kathryn Hopkins</p>",
  "<p>English churches opposing the ordination of women and homosexuals are planning to defect from the Church of England to join the Global Anglican Future Conference, a breakaway movement launched earlier this year. </p> <p>Rod Thomas, chair of the conservative evangelical group Reform, warned that orthodox figures such as Michael Nazir-Ali, the bishop of Rochester, were increasingly sidelined in favour of liberals and called on congregations to support the development of a UK wing in Gafcon, an international network for Anglicans that disagrees with progressive agendas. </p> <p>Endorsing and promoting the network in this country would allow access to alternative spiritual leadership from conservatives here and overseas, he said. Thomas was speaking at Reform's annual conference, ending today, and told hundreds of delegates that Reform was an \"ardent supporter\" of the movement, raising more than \u00a365,000 to fund the attendance of bishops from the developing world. </p> <p>Gafcon claims to represent half of the world's Anglicans and already provides alternative spiritual leadership to disaffected parishes around the world, mostly in the US, where same-sex blessings and the consecration of gay clergy have exacerbated tensions in the Episcopal church.</p> <p>Thomas said: \"As the two religions develop, our leadership will become increasingly schizophrenic. General Synod has already become dysfunctional. Some bishops appear to act as politicians responding to lobbying tactics rather than as shepherds of the flock.\" </p> <p>At a separate press briefing, Thomas said that the process of realignment with more sympathetic leaders would be complete by 2014, when the first woman bishop is likely to be appointed.</p>",
  "<p>With our photographer on hand to record it, yesterday's cabinet meeting took place in high political spirits - and no wonder. The miseries of Labour's summer, the defeats in Crewe and Glasgow East, the abject poll numbers and all the leadership plotting have been set aside. The prime minister believes he is on the bounce with British public opinion after his bank rescue plan and the upward surges on the stockmarket. But it is not just in Britain that shares in Gordon Brown are rising. World opinion is talking up his achievements too. Monday night's US network news programmes praised him as the man with the plan that all the other governments are following. On the eve of today's European summit even an online poll by France's Le Monde says Mr Brown is playing the key role in the crisis, ahead of Nicolas Sarkozy, who is no slouch when it comes to placing himself at the centre of events. Meanwhile Mr Brown has also been hymned as the man who saved the global financial system by no less a judge than the new Nobel economics laureate Paul Krugman.</p> <p>Heady stuff. And Mr Brown does indeed have reasons to be cheerful. Britain's economy may be small in global terms but, as Professor Krugman pointed out, the government has thought clearly about the crisis that has paralysed the financial markets and has acted undogmatically and with unusual decisiveness to unlock the flows of capital and credit. Not all of this is Mr Brown's sole doing. Alistair Darling has played a calming and sensible role too, a welcome contrast to the hubris sometimes displayed by some Treasury predecessors. And these are also very early days. Much may unravel. As the portrait of Walpole in today's centre-spread cabinet room photograph should alert his successor to recall, those who are ringing the bells today may tomorrow be wringing their hands.</p> <p>Mr Brown should be extremely wary of presuming too much too soon about the public mood. Recent national opinion polls may have seen the best Labour figures for some months, but that is not saying much. Labour remains well adrift of the Conservatives - 10 points behind in the latest poll - and well short of its own share of the vote in 2005, while the weekend YouGov survey showed that large majorities are highly critical of Mr Brown's management of the economy. He has certainly won plaudits from insiders for his handling of the financial crisis, but it does not follow that voters as a whole will be as complimentary. In bad times voters tend to punish incumbents. They measure the economic situation not by watching the markets or tracking the movements of unimaginably large sums but by how it affects their own jobs, costs, mortgages and prospects. These indexes are all likely to get worse as recession deepens and bites. When an election comes, the fact that Mr Brown may have saved the financial institutions could count for less than the powerful charge - which the opposition parties were already making yesterday - that he is the man who allowed the banks to steer on to the rocks in the first place. When he compares himself to Churchill, Mr Brown should remember what the voters did to Churchill once the war was over.</p> <p>Yet the spring in the government's step is plain to see. The outbreak of decisiveness seems contagious too. In the past 48 hours the government has abandoned not just the objectionable 42-day pre-trial detention clauses in the counter-terrorism bill, but now the pernicious secret inquest clauses too. Yesterday ministers also cut their losses by scrapping compulsory school testing for 14-year-olds, to be replaced next year with a more flexible system of teacher assessment. The dash for popularity is clearly concerted. At this rate, ID card plans may not survive long either, and British troops could be home from Iraq by spring. An early election ahead of the recession? Surely not. After what happened in 2007 Mr Brown would be crazy to set that hare running again.</p>",
  "<p>The revival of the markets has postponed the sensation that violent revolution is imminent. No longer are the sages telling us the entire system is minutes away from total collapse. The first aid, devised by Gordon Brown and hailed and emulated from the US to the eurozone, seems to have soothed the fevered brow of the moneymen. For now at least. </p> <p>Still, even if the mob is not about to storm finance ministries from Paris to Washington, few doubt that we are witnessing an epochal event, living through one of those moments on which history pivots. Newsweek International editor Fareed Zakaria writes that he had always wanted to experience the kind of event \"one reads about in books. Well, this is it\". In the Financial Times, Philip Stephens says that two centuries of US and European domination are now at an end, as the western economic model is humbled. Robert Peston announces the end of the Thatcherite age. On these pages yesterday Steve Bell consigned the lady herself to the dustbin of history. </p> <p>Of course, these verdicts might turn out to be overblown. Some are counselling that the great turmoil of 2008 will turn out to be less tempestuous than advertised. For one thing, the Brownian notion of part-nationalising the banks could work, turning what would have been a major depression into a mere, if harsh, recession. In that case, the political impact would surely be muted. The ground was laid for Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal not simply by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, but the lines of the destitute queueing for a bowl of soup. In this view, a convulsion to the financial system will not, by itself, be enough to usher in a new political era; not unless the tremors shake the real-world economy and society along with it. </p> <p>Still, let's accept that the events of the past few week are indeed epochal. Most are quite clear on what has ended: the era of let-it-rip, unfettered market capitalism has surely drawn to a close. As Andrew Simms, policy director of the New Economics Foundation, puts it: \"This is to finance-driven capitalism what 1989 was to Soviet communism.\" In both cases, too much unaccountable power had concentrated in too few hands, with too little transparency, as those in charge lived in a financial fantasy land, playing with numbers wholly detached from productive economic activity.</p> <p>If that's now all over, what's coming next? The first shift might be a radically different approach to public spending. Now that they have seen their governments spend eye-popping sums of money to get out of a crisis, won't voters demand similar largesse to solve other pressing problems? For decades, politicians have told constituents that there simply isn't the cash to pay for, say, the \u00a33bn that would be needed to halve child poverty by 2010, or the annual \u00a38bn it would take to get 20% of our energy from renewable sources. Now, though, those look like paltry sums next to the \u00a337bn the government plans to inject into Britain's ailing banks. Saving post office branches in deprived areas at a cost of \u00a3150m? Small change! In this way, the rhetoric of public discussion on spending could change drastically, with voters' patience for arguments of prudence evaporated. \"If you could find the money to clear up the mess left by a few greedy fat cats,\" voters will say, \"then you can find the money to fund this bus service/save this village school/renationalise the railways.\"</p> <p>Or it could go the other way. The politicians may find that, though the public mood becomes more conducive to active, high-spending government, they simply lack the means to pay for any of it. They will have already borrowed to the hilt for the banks bail-out and will have nothing left, resources further depleted by the coming recession. In this atmosphere of fiscal tightness, ministers could skirt round vexed ideological terrain and simply plead poverty. There would be no need for an embarrassing U-turn on, say, the principle of ID cards: Jacqui Smith could say she still thinks they are a good idea but, at an estimated \u00a36bn or more, we simply cannot afford them. Ditto Trident renewal: Brown could insist he maintains his faith in nukes but say that at, \u00a320bn, revamped weaponry is a luxury Britain cannot afford. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the public failure of unregulated free markets has been so visible it could lead to a demand that financial institutions now operate by criteria other than the narrow, selfish measure of their own bottom line, taking into account the wider needs of society as a whole. If that sounds like woolly, hopelessly utopian thinking, consider this. RBS is set to be majority-owned by you and me, the taxpayer. HBOS is not far off. Now what will those banks do when faced with people falling behind on their mortgage payments? In the past they would have ordered repossession, which made sense in terms of pure profit and loss. But now there will be other factors to consider, because these banks will no longer work solely for dividend-hungry shareholders but for the taxpayer. Every family that has endured a repossession costs the public purse, through rehousing, most obviously, but in myriad and less visible ways - right down to the burden that falls on the NHS as it repairs the mental and emotional damage inflicted by forced eviction. </p> <p>Now since RBS's imminent owners - us - have to pay those bills as well, we will surely demand that the bank slow down rather than move in for the kill, perhaps through restructuring the debt of that struggling homeowner or at least running a \"full-impact assessment\" of repossession. The government already promises to impose demands on the banks they part-own, including gentler treatment of small businesses. But once taxpayers realise their new-found power, there is no reason to assume it will be confined to just those areas. We could insist the banks we partly own behave in an entirely new way. </p> <p>No less clear a lesson of 2008 is that we have to live much more closely within our means. That must apply to individuals, reining in the credit- card habits of the past decade, and to governments who have perpetuated what Zakaria calls \"a great fraud\", spending ever more without raising taxes. The result in the US is a national debt of $10.2 trillion. </p> <p>That act of denial has to end now. It will mean either cutting back on spending or increasing taxes, or both. But that needn't be as gloomy as it sounds. Revenues could rise by taxing those things we want to see the back of anyway: starting with a windfall tax on the energy companies, penalising them for their reliance on fossil fuels. As for spending, we could shed the waste - ID cards and Trident renewal - and spend what we have on a massive effort to green our society, from home to factory. That would obey classic New Deal logic, providing jobs, helping those in fuel poverty, tackling climate change and keeping the economy ticking over - all at the same time.</p> <p>Simms at the NEF thinks we may end up going further, moving to shorter working weeks as people accept that they will earn less and consume less - but will have more time for family, friends and life. That seems like a radical fantasy now, but who knows? For when old dogmas die, there is room for all kinds of new thinking. The financial tsunami has given us this if nothing else - a chance to start again.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\">freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Paul Dixon, the chairman of the Racehorse Owners' Association, said yesterday that he is determined to \"put a positive spin\" on reports that a sale of the Tote has been shelved indefinitely due to the global economic crisis.</p> <p>A consortium of racing interests has had bids of \u00a3400m and \u00a3320m for the Tote's business turned down by the Government, but its operation, which includes pool betting and a chain of high street shops, is estimated to be worth \u00a3250m at most in the current climate.</p> <p>Dixon said it was now time for racing to build up the Tote in the interests of the sport, regardless of its ownership status. \"The Tote has always been seen as racing's bookmaker,\" Dixon said. \"There is no reason why we cannot grow the product without physically owning it.</p> <p>\"We will be working closely with both the Racecourse Association and the new Tote chairman with a view to enhancing the operation for the benefit of racing.</p> <p>\"The ROA has 8,000 members and if they want to have a bet, we want to encourage them to have that bet with the Tote.

  "<p>Not long after I took office as Mexico's foreign minister in 2001, a novel problem came across my desk. An Argentine naval officer who had resettled in Mexico under an assumed name was wanted by Spain on charges of genocide, torture, and terrorism. The officer, <a href=\"http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAMR410042001?open&amp;of=ENG-MEX\">Ricardo Miguel Cavallo</a>, was implicated in abuses committed in 1977 and 1978 at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_War\">notorious Naval Mechanics School</a> in Buenos Aires. According to the Spanish indictment, Cavallo belonged to the operations unit of a group actively involved in kidnapping and torturing people whom the military regime perceived as leftist.</p> <p>The question before me was whether to extradite Cavallo to Spain, a third country, to face trial for human rights abuses committed in Argentina. Signing the papers would be groundbreaking, as it would signal for the first time that suspected rights abusers might face trial anywhere in the world if justice was not likely at home. </p> <p>For me, the decision was straightforward: the crimes demanded justice, and Cavallo was more likely to be held to account in Spain than in Argentina. Amnesty laws in Argentina at the time shielded him from prosecution. I signed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/19/argentina.theeditorpressreview\">the extradition papers</a>. </p> <p>Since then, many inroads have been made to ensure that the world's most serious crimes no longer go unpunished. The international criminal court is up and running, and 107 states, including Mexico, have ratified the treaty establishing the court and acceded to its jurisdiction. </p> <p>National courts, such as those in Spain, play an increasingly strong role in combating impunity through the exercise of universal jurisdiction. The rise of these types of prosecutions has in turn motivated countries, including Argentina and Chile, to repeal their amnesty laws so that suspected war criminals can be prosecuted at home. The trials of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/europe/2001/yugoslavia_after_milosevic/\">Slobodan Milosevic</a> and <a href=\"http://charlestaylortrial.org/\">Charles Taylor</a> have demonstrated that even heads of state are no longer safe from prosecution. The comfort level for perpetrators of these crimes is shrinking as the options for prosecution expand. </p> <p>Whether the progress in this battle against impunity continues or slides backwards is now in the hands of the United Nations security council. On July 14, the ICC prosecutor, Argentine lawyer Luis Moreno-Ocampo, announced that he was seeking an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for orchestrating the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/29/sudan.warcrimes\">atrocities in Darfur</a>. Immediately after the announcement, Sudan's government and its allies began a diplomatic campaign aimed at securing a security council deferral of the investigations for 12 months. They are attracting wider support than they should \u2013 in part because of fear of retaliation against UN peacekeepers and humanitarian workers. </p> <p>But the security council must be extremely cautious in considering any suspension of ICC proceedings. Such a decision would be a serious setback to the movement to end impunity for the most serious crimes. It would show that indicted warlords and dictators can avoid justice by holding the security council hostage to threats of more violence. </p> <p>Suspending the ICC's work in this way would undermine its potential for deterrence, one of the purposes for which it was established. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/14/sudan.humanrights\">Postponing the case</a> against al-Bashir would seriously undercut the important principle \u2013 which has gradually been taking root worldwide \u2013 that no one is above the law. </p> <p>The security council's decision to refer the situation in Darfur to the ICC prosecutor in March 2005 was itself a major milestone in the battle against impunity. That decision demonstrated, for the first time, that there was an institution that could investigate and prosecute the most serious international crimes regardless of where they occur. </p> <p>Apart from being a victory for international justice, the referral was also a promise to victims of the horrific crimes in Darfur that the perpetrators of the crimes against them would one day be held accountable. For the security council to step back from that commitment would do more than abandon the victims in Darfur. It would be a major blow to those around the world who have struggled to put an end to impunity for perpetrators of humanity's most terrible crimes. </p> <p><em>Jorge G Casta\u00f1eda, former foreign minister of Mexico (2000-2003), is a global distinguished professor of politics and Latin American studies at New York University</em></p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",
  "<p>After an \"emotionally draining\" and closely fought final judging session, Aravind Adiga, one of the two debut novelists on the Man Booker shortlist, was last night awarded the \u00a350,000 prize for The White Tiger, a bracingly modern novel about the dark side of the new India.</p> <p>Adiga, 33, is a surprise winner: at long odds he batted aside the claims of veteran writers on the shortlist such as Sebastian Barry and Amitav Ghosh.</p> <p>He is only the fourth first time novelist to win the prize, after Keri Hulme in 1985, Arundhati Roy in 1997 and DBC Pierre in 2003 - and he is the second youngest after Ben Okri, who won in 1991 aged 32.</p> <p>Michael Portillo, the chair of the judges, talked of a final panel meeting characterised by \"passionate debate\". Adiga's book won by a \"sufficient\", but by no means unanimous, margin.</p> <p>\"It was pretty close,\" said Portillo, and in the last stages it was down to a battle between The White Tiger and one other book.</p> <p>The White Tiger takes a sharp and unblinking look at the reality of India's economic miracle. Its antihero and narrator, Balram Halwai, is a cocksure, uneducated young man, the son of an impoverished rickshaw driver. By lying, betraying and using his sharp intelligence, Balram makes his ascent into the heady heights of Bangalore's big business.</p> <p>The writing of the novel, said Adiga, had come out of his career as a journalist, and his encounters - as a relatively privileged middle-class man - with members of India's underclass.</p> <p>\"Class is a boring topic to write about. Big divides are not what people are interested in. But it's the most pressing concern - because other things spring out of it, like terrorism and instability,\" he said. \"The book has done very well in India - and there is a need for books like this.</p> <p>\"Something extraordinary is happening between the rich and the poor. Once, there was at least a common culture between rich and poor, but that has been eroded, and people have noted that.\"</p> <p>Asked what he would do with the money, he said: \"The first thing is to find a bank I can put it in.\"</p> <p>Portillo said that Adiga \"undertakes an extraordinary task - he gains and holds the attention of the reader for a hero who is a thoroughgoing villain\".</p> <p>He also praised the work's attention to \"important social issues: the division between rich and poor, and issues on a global scale. And it is extremely readable.\" The main criterion for the prize, he said, was: \"Does this book knock my socks off? And this did.\"</p> <p>The feeling among the judges, Portillo said, was that \"here was a book on the cutting edge, dealing with a different aspect of India, unfamiliar perhaps to many readers. What set it apart was its originality. The feeling was that this was new territory.\"</p> <p>Portillo likened the novel to Macbeth. \"It is about ambition realised through murder,\" he said, \"but with a delicious twist. Whereas Lady Macbeth and Macbeth are driven mad by their crime, the hero of this book is only driven mad by the fact that he hesitated and might not have committed his crime.\"</p> <p>The novel takes the form of seven letters addressed by Balram to the Chinese premier on the eve of a state visit, and its tone is almost Dickensian, as the unpleasant reality of contemporary Indian society is revealed via mordant sketches of characters, from millionaires in their air-conditioned tower blocks to the unfortunates who are trapped in poverty and who live literally below them, catering to their every whim.</p> <p>Kevin Rushby, reviewing the book for the Guardian, called it \"a witty parable of India's changing society\".</p> <p>Adiga was born in Chennai in 1974 and was raised partly in Australia. Having studied at Columbia and Oxford universities, he became a journalist, and has written for Time magazine and many British newspapers. He lives in Mumbai.</p> <p>The other authors on the shortlist were Philip Hensher for The Northern Clemency, Steve Toltz for A Fraction of the Whole, and Linda Grant for The Clothes on Their Backs.</p> <p>The other judges were Alex Clark, critic and editor of Granta; the novelist Louise Doughty; James Heneage, the founder of Ottakar's bookshops; and Hardeep Singh Kohli, the broadcaster. </p> <h2>Extract</h2> <p>Now, I no longer watch Hindi films - on principle - but back in the days when I used to, just before the movie got started, either the number 786 would flash against the black screen - the Muslims think this is a magic number that represents their god - or else you would see the picture of a woman in a white sari with gold sovereigns dripping down to her feet, which is the goddess Lakhshmi, of the Hindus.</p> <p>It is an ancient and veneratedcustom of people in my country to start a story by praying to a Higher Power. I guess, Your Excellency, that I too should start off by kissing some god's arse.</p> <p>Which god's arse, though? There are so many choices. </p> <p>See the Muslims have one god. The Christians have three gods. And we Hindus have 36,000,000 gods.</p> <p>Making a grand total of 36,000,004 divine arses for me to choose from.</p> <p>Now there are some, and I don't just mean Communists like you, but thinking men of all political parties, who think that not many of these gods actually exist.</p> <p>Some believe that none of them exist. There's just us and an ocean of darkness around us. I'm no philosopher or poet, how would I know the truth? It's true that all these gods seem to do awfully little work - much like our politicians - and yet keep winning re-election to their golden thrones in heaven, year after year.</p>",
  "<p>While the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">financial crisis</a> is deepening and spreading, attention is turning to the east. A cartoon in <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/\">the Australian</a> shows a character saying that western capitalists are looking for eastern socialists to save them.</p> <p>To Kevin Rudd, the Australian prime minister, this is not a joke. He argued during a Radio Australia interview that the steady growth of China's economy would be extremely helpful for getting Australia out of the financial crisis.</p> <p>According to the International Monetary Fund's economic forecast published last week, most western countries are facing recession next year, while China's economy will keep growing at 9%. Rudd believes this is good news for Australia. China's demands for ore, coal and other materials has fuelled the growth of Australia in the recent years. At the moment, China is Australia's largest trading partner.</p> <p>Last week's announcement of <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-10/13/content_7100756.htm\">interest rates cuts</a> by China was part of a coordinated effort by the world's central banks. It was seen by most media commentators not as a necessary step to protect China's financial system, but as a signal showing China's willingness to take more responsibilities on the international stage.</p> <p>It is obvious to China that in economic, political and diplomatic terms, it is now in good position in relation to Australia, US and Europe.</p> <p>President Hu Jintao told President George Bush in a phone conversation that the success of America's rescue plan would be good for China as well. However, even if the plan doesn't work quickly, or the crisis spreads, China is still relatively safe because its financial system is largely isolated from the rest of the world, and its economy is growing steadily. The big drop in commodity prices also means inflationary pressures is partially lessened. In short, the global financial crisis presents China with more opportunities than difficulties.</p> <p>In terms of China's relationship with Australia, this means not only that China has more bargaining power over the price of raw materials, but it also raises the possibility that Australia will allow more Chinese companies to invest in the commodity industry. In political terms, this means that since winning China's cooperation is important, Australia will have to pay more attention to China's stance on Taiwan and other Asia-Pacific issues.</p> <p>From America's point of view, China's help is needed to get out of the current crisis. To cope with the economic downturn and high unemployment, America will have to increase its exports to China. One way to do this is to relax some of the unreasonable restraints on exporting to China. The current deficit is partly a result of America's post-cold war mentality. If the US could get rid of some of its outdated containment policies towards China, and allow the selling of some advanced equipment and technologies, the trade deficit could easily turn to surplus.</p> <p>Unfortunately European policy-makers have the same mentality as their American counterparts. Enjoying cheap imports from China, they complain about the trade deficit; while at the same time they still impose restrictions on exports to China. Under the Labour government, the UK is reluctant to sell China what it thinks are sensitive products. A list by China's ministry of commerce shows China wants to import but can't get products, technologies, and patents in the area of aviation, electronic equipment and carbon fibre materials from the UK. What western leaders should see is that in the long term, China will be a partner rather than a potential competitors or even enemy. Kevin Rudd has realised it, what about Gordon Brown?</p>",

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338589470\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The Bush administration has reluctantly followed Britain's lead by pumping $250bn (\u00a3143bn) into shares in leading banks after a stockmarket meltdown scotched earlier efforts to shore up crumbling confidence in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomy\">the financial system</a>.</p> <p>Under a programme described by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/georgebush\">President George Bush</a> as \"unprecedented and aggressive\", the US treasury will initially buy minority stakes in America's nine leading banks including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America and Citigroup. Thousands of community banks will be eligible to follow.</p> <p>Many of Wall Street's top banks were unwilling to take the money, fearing it would be seen as an admission of weakness, but they were given little choice by the treasury secretary, Henry Paulson.</p> <p>In a televised address from the White House, President Bush stressed the measures were temporary and banks would buy back the government's shares once the economy recovered: \"These measures are not intended to take over the free market, but to preserve it.\"</p> <p>He said the new capital would help healthy banks continue to provide loans to businesses, while aiding struggling banks to resume loans to support job creation: \"This is an essential short-term measure to ensure the viability of America's banking system.\"</p> <p>To further kickstart lending, the US treasury will guarantee loans issued by banks, the Federal Reserve will become a buyer of last resort for unwanted commercial debt and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will provide a broader guarantee for small businesses' bank accounts.</p> <p>Although the treasury disclosed no figures, an industry source said the biggest investments of $25bn each would be in JP Morgan, Citigroup and Bank of America. About $20bn will go into Wells Fargo, while $10bn each will be injected into Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. A smaller sum of $3bn apiece will go to State Street and Bank of New York.</p> <p>All the banks involved in the programme will be required to curb executive pay. So-called \"golden parachutes\" for departing bosses will be banned, as will bonus programmes viewed as encouraging excessive risk taking. </p> <p>There will also be an end to tax relief for banks on payouts of more than $500,000.</p> <p>Banking chiefs were given little option. An insider said Paulson dictated the terms after summoning chief executives to the treasury on Monday: \"It wasn't a debate.\"</p> <p>The plan was greeted warmly on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketturmoil\">Wall Street</a>, where shares traded higher. Building on Monday's record surge of 936 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 115 points to 9,503 during the morning session in New York.</p> <p>Buying banks' shares amounts to a U-turn for the embattled US treasury secretary, who initially wanted to spend a $700bn emergency fund by simply picking out distressed assets from banks' balance sheets. </p> <p>Paulson told Congress last month that \"the right way to do this is not going around and using guarantees or injecting capital\", arguing that Japan had limited success with such a policy during a banking crisis in the 1990s.</p> <p>Last week's stock market meltdown forced Paulson to take a more radical approach - but he made it clear he was doing so with distaste. Speaking in the treasury's ornate Cash Room, he said: \"Government owning a stake in any private US company is objectionable to most Americans - me included. Yet the alternative of leaving businesses and consumers without access to financing is totally unacceptable.\"</p> <p>The programme means the US government will be the biggest owner of banking shares in the country. The treasury will be granted preferred shares without the usual voting rights and will not be involved in day-to-day management decisions. </p> <p>The shares will carry a 5% dividend for taxpayers, rising to 9% after five years, and banks will be banned from raising dividends for ordinary investors for three years.</p> <p>Leading financiers expressed optimism that the measures would thaw out the frozen credit markets. Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity firm Blackstone, said it could be the action that \"breaks the back of the credit crisis\". </p> <p>Speaking at a conference in Dubai, Schwarzman said: \"We will be looking today to an absolute sea change in the global financial system in terms of liquidity.\"</p> <p>Deutsche Bank's chief US economist, Joseph Lavorgna, said he believed the US stockmarket had bottomed out and a fear of systemic banking failure had subsided.</p> <p>\"The government is essentially saying there are certain institutions we won't allow to fail, that they won't fail and that we're putting money behind it,\" Lavorgna said.</p> <p>The US government's actions are similar to measures adopted in Europe which were discussed at a meeting of G7 finance ministers at the weekend. Britain's government has won praise for taking a swift lead from economists including the Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman.</p> <p>On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, market strategist Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners said the government plan had begun to \"penetrate the core of the problem\" but he warned the market still faced the prospect of a lengthy recession.</p> <p>\"There will be a point in time where the euphoria of the bailout plan begins to wear off and the market begins to face reality,\" Cardillo said.</p> <p>The Bush administration's actions won support from both sides of the US political fence. The Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, said the plan was the right one - but he called for additional help for homeowners battling foreclosure.</p> <p>\"We must make sure this plan is implemented in a way that helps homeowners and does not enrich Wall Street CEOs at the taxpayers' expense,\" said Obama.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain released new economic proposals today putting an end to days of apparent wavering over whether a fresh approach to the global financial crisis is required. </p> <p>McCain unveiled new fiscal policies during a speech in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania as the Republican nominee tried to counter the perception that his campaign has run aground. </p> <p>On Sunday a close ally, Republican senator Lindsey Graham, told CBS news that the McCain camp would reboot its financial message. But the candidate offered no new details in a Virginia speech yesterday that focused on attacking Democratic leaders. </p> <p>The McCain camp outlined its new proposals in an early press release: \"John McCain will address the ongoing economic crisis, with a special emphasis on those most badly hurt: workers, homeowners, savers, and seniors. He will announce specific proposals to build on his Resurgence Plan \u2026 and turn the corner on the crisis by charting new directions for workers, seniors, and savers.\" </p> <p>Four specific new plans were mentioned in a McCain press release: a moratorium on taxation of unemployment benefits, a cut in the capital gains tax, tax cuts for senior citizens who withdraw money from their retirement accounts and an \"accelerated tax write-off for those who suffered losses in the current market downturn\". Obama endorsed the first of those four yesterday.</p> <p>Focussing on taxes allows McCain to tap one of the few remaining policy areas that still favours Republicans, although Obama spokesman Bill Burton was quick to contend that Democratic tax proposals go even further. </p> <p>\"[McCain's] plan continues to provide no tax relief at all to 101 million hardworking families, including 97% of senior citizens, and it does nothing to cut taxes for small businesses or give them access to credit,\" Burton said in a statement. </p> <p>\"Senator McCain also shows how little he understands the economy by offering lower capital gains rates in a year in which people don't have an awful lot of capital gains.\"</p> <p>McCain also used today's speech to reiterate two earlier suggestions for coping with the credit crunch and volatile stock market.</p> <p>McCain has proposed a one-year waiver of US savings rules that require those over the age of 70 to begin withdrawing money from their retirement accounts, thus shielding older Americans from the current market downturn. </p> <p>The Republican nominee also has suggested that the government buy up risky mortgages from banks at their face value, effectively shifting the pain of rising foreclosures from lenders to the American taxpayers. </p> <p>That so-called Resurgence Plan has faced a barrage of criticism from both liberals and conservatives, but the McCain camp signalled it would not back away from the idea today. </p> <p>While McCain works to build credibility with voters on the economy, one of his biggest challenges is staunching a tide of negative coverage that has depicted Obama's lead as nearly insurmountable. </p> <p>\"This has been a very tactically oriented campaign that responds to the previous night's evening news,\" Republican pollster David Winston told the Los Angeles Times. \"As a result, they've gone from tactical decision to tactical decision without any strategy to tie that together.\" </p> <p>By contrast, Obama devoted much of yesterday to promoting a new four-point plan to rescue the economy, creating the risk that McCain's fiscal speech today would make him appear defensive. </p> <p>A Washington Post/ABC news poll released yesterday showed Obama 10 points ahead of McCain nationally.</p>",
  "<p>The eurozone has stood up. One is entitled to adapt a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong#Leadership_of_China\">quotation of Chairman Mao</a> on this occasion, since last weekend has seen the People's Republic of China playing a major role in the ongoing bail-out of the American investment banking industry. But even more significant was that it has also seen the clearest demonstration by the states participating in the European single currency that their response to the current crisis will be to deepen yet further their economic coordination and integration.</p> <p>The line has been drawn under last week's unfortunate \"go it alone\" initiatives started by Ireland and given weight by Germany. In the new committee of the president of the European Union, the president of the commission, the chairman of the eurozone and the governor of the European Central Bank, we have the start of an institutional framework for the political governance of the eurozone. In the structures to guarantee inter\u2013bank lending, although the funding remains at national level, we have the first steps towards true transnational burden sharing. In the announcement of the taxpayers funds to support banks in difficulties, we have the beginnings of a common fiscal regime. When all this is taken together with the European Central Bank's capacity to cut interest rates, which is now far greater than that of either the Federal Reserve or of the Bank of England, we have the makings of a fundamental shift in the economic leadership of the west from America to Europe.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, the UK Treasury deserves considerable credit for having established the policy principles for dealing with this crisis, which have now been adopted by the governments of the eurozone. But then, it had to. Britain's banking system, because it has mirrored more closely American rather than continental European practice, has faced far deeper problems than the financial institutions of the eurozone, with the possible exception of those of Ireland. The continental European perception, which has so outraged British Eurosceptics, that this crisis has been fundamentally made in America, and constitutes the comprehensive defeat of the highly leveraged Anglo-Saxon banking model, remains entirely valid. </p> <p>Central to the Eurosceptics' criticism has been their claim, as argued by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/europe-eu\">Simon Tilford and Philip Whyte</a> in the Guardian, that the widening of the spreads between, for example, the yield on German and Greek government bonds, suggests that the euro is about to fall apart under the pressure of profound intra-member state macroeconomic imbalances. This is based on the assumption that Portugal, Italy, Greece or Spain, the much derided \"Pigs\", would be far better off with their own currency, which they could devalue in order to restore external competitiveness. But if anything has been demonstrated by the recent market turmoil, it is the paramount importance of credit-worthiness. The yield spreads on government borrowing of countries which cannot print their way out of their obligations to their creditors, is the surest guarantee that ultimately fiscal disciplines will prevail.</p> <p>No such certainty is available for those whom the British government will be wishing to entice into gilts in order to fund a banking bail-out, which, in terms of percentage GDP, far exceeds anything being undertaken in the eurozone, including Ireland. Moreover, we are already seeing the impact of sterling's devaluation against the dollar on our import prices. Once global price stability is restored, the inflation restraint upon the UK economy is likely, once again, to become acute, since the rise of Asia is now structurally inflationary. If, on the other hand, we face a prolonged global recession, substantial enough to blunt these price pressures, fiscal contraction will make the burden of funding government debt intolerable. The eurozone allows its members, even its weakest ones, to substantially evade this most painful dilemma. </p> <p>It would be difficult to imagine a more favourable environment, both from the point of view of high and low politics, in which to relaunch the campaign for Britain's full commitment to the European Union, including joining the single currency. The high politics are that the west must now find much greater unity of purpose if it is to preserve its values in the face of what has been a massive loss of leadership and power to Asia and, in particular, to China.</p> <p>A powerful, united and prosperous Europe is now the key to the continuing strength of western values. One that will be able to forge a partnership of equals across the Atlantic and rally into its sphere of influence the remainder of the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and north Africa. But such a grand and generous ambition will only be possible if Britain is fully engaged in the European project. No European country has a greater understanding of the Atlantic dimension of European civilisation. No European country is more experienced in a global role. It is no exaggeration to say that if Britain becomes committed to the promotion of genuine international democracy which the European model represents, then it will still be possible to be optimistic about the eventual triumph of liberalism and individualism. </p> <p>Then there are the low politics, which have already been signalled, almost too perfectly, by the return of <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4878623.ece\">Peter Mandelson</a> to the cabinet. The chancellor's statement in the House of Commons yesterday, in which he vindicated Gordon Brown's almost honorary membership of the Councils of the eurozone, and his assessment that the weekend's events had reinforced the importance of Britain's membership of the European Union, are the first expressions of a new strategy. Europe is once again becoming the Conservative party's Achilles heel.</p> <p>With a prospective Obama presidency abandoning the notion that Britain should choose America rather than Europe, the proposition which was the neocon lifeblood of Tory Euroscepticism, with the British public generally blaming America for the coming recession and with the whole ideological climate having shifted sharply from right to left, Cameron faces an impossible task. No amount of abandoning not just his tie, but also his business suit and sounding like a Marxist in relation to City bonuses can draw the poison against Europe, which now infects every level of his party. The more Gordon Brown plays the European card over the coming months, the more certain he can be of transforming the turnaround of the past fortnight into a platform for another election victory, or at the very least, a hung parliament. Europe should be the new axis which would make an eventual cooperation with the Liberal Democrats possible, perhaps at last, even to the extent of a new progressive coalition.</p> <p>Of course, there are still severe challenges ahead. Brown remains a deeply compromised figure as a credible pro-European and he cannot escape the blame for a severe recession, which is now unavoidable. There is also the nagging concern that the possibility of <a href=\"http://www.snp.org/node/14204\">Scottish independence</a> will undermine our image amongst global investors of absolute constitutional stability and thus threaten our capacity to fund the bail-out of our financial system and counter the cyclical deterioration of our public finances.</p> <p>It could also undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland, a prospect rendered more dangerous by the deep dysfunction of politics in the Republic, as expressed by the no vote on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/13/ireland\">Lisbon treaty</a>. This puts into even sharper relief Cameron and Hague's determination to oppose its ratification to the limit. There is also the marked trend in today's Conservative party, as it is forced away from its traditional pro-American stance, to anchor its continued hostility to Europe in a narrow English nationalism; one which the pressures of recession could drive towards extremist attitudes on issues such as immigration and welfare.</p> <p>Nevertheless, a closer commitment to Europe could sustain the union and the peace settlement in Ulster and create a framework for a new economic policy, including eventual membership of the euro that would offer the best prospect of an early recovery in growth. In any event, Europe, the great sleeping issue of British politics, which has destroyed, in one way or another, every government since Suez, is once more at the centre of our political debate.</p>",
  "<p>The term \"game changing election\" has been bandied about with such frequency by the US punditry that it's almost a clich\u00e9 at the moment. But like most clich\u00e9s, it survives because there is a core of absolute truth to it that refuses to be dismissed. Both presidential campaigns are playing the game. Their approaches to it seem tied to the personal recreations preferred by the candidates: McCain, the designated maverick, is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/us/politics/28gambling-web.html?hp\">playing a hand</a> of high-stakes poker and attempting an audacious bluff for all the marbles. That might be useful, if Obama were also playing poker \u2013 but he's not. Obama <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0712/price.obama/content.1.html\">prefers basketball</a>.</p> <p>McCain's strategy to this point has been that of a good poker player, distracting attention from perceived weaknesses with bluster and misdirection while he builds his position. Of course, the cards in his hand are poor, so he cannot hope to win by calling his opponent's hand. The best he can hope for is for Obama to fold by making a devastating gaffe that turns the bulk of the US electorate against him.</p> <p>McCain seems to see politics as a series of hands: the primaries, the conventions, the debates, the television ads, the six-second soundbyte for the evening news. Choosing Sarah Palin for a running mate was a bold, high-stakes move. It's a one-man show (plus the hot babe standing next to him cooing flattering encouragement in his ear) and every hand adds something to the pot. Lose on one, try to make it up on the other, and hopefully at the end of the day you come out just enough ahead in the electoral college to take the pot. </p> <p>It's political brinksmanship at its most acute. When you seem desperately behind, you raise the stakes and change the game. It's a dangerous game, but you don't become a fighter pilot \u2013 however mediocre \u2013 without learning how to play poker. McCain has just the sort of devil-may-care, Top Gun mentality (with accompanying set of brass testes) to possibly pull off a bluff of this magnitude. Not many men have the nerves to do it. Poker is his game, and <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1819898-2,00.html\">he's a gambler</a>. It all comes down to that one last bluff, and whether Obama (or the other players at the table, the American people) will raise, call or fold. </p> <p>I actually don't know much about poker except what I pick up on cable, but since I live in one of the global hotspots for competitive collegiate basketball \u2013 between powerhouses <a href=\"http://www.goduke.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPID=1845&amp;SPSID=22724\">Duke</a> and <a href=\"http://tarheelblue.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/unc-m-baskbl-body.html\">UNC</a> \u2013 I know that game better. In basketball the strategy is far less about storming the basket manfully and making points \u2013 although that's the showy part. It's about having more points than your opponent when the buzzer sounds the end of the game. Obama's campaign understands that.</p> <p>Obama has fielded a wide-ranging zone defence, putting trusted, competent people in positions of responsibility, giving them enough direction to keep them actively supporting each other but enough freedom for them to improvise if the ball lands in their hands. He's kept the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-money13-2008oct13,0,6436466.story\">constant resources flowing</a>, augmenting his substantial paid staff with hordes of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/11/AR2008101102119.html\">enthusiastic volunteers</a>. He's running the court by making the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/us/politics/13caucus.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">Republican party compete in states</a> they never suspected that he'd be strong in. He's adeptly used competent proxies to attack his opponents, allowing him to appear above the fray, and he's kept the ball moving by maintaining focus on the most pressing issues of the campaign \u2013 the war and the economy \u2013 while dismissing the distractions.</p> <p>His surrogates aggressively guard him from the smears by going on the offensive, man-to-man. And they are prepared for everything. Hillary Clinton tempered the campaign for all of Obama's negatives during the Democratic primary. Now they immediately and aggressively counter.</p> <p>William Ayers? The Alaskan Independence Party. Tony Rezko? Keating Five. Earmarks? One trillion dollars in Republican deficit spending on the wars alone. The potential of higher taxes? The certainty of higher health insurance premiums. Didn't back the surge in Iraq? Didn't back the dumb war to begin with. Every argument has a counter, and the Obama campaign has a full arsenal of responses to these last-second misdirections because he understands the game.</p> <p>While all the attention is being paid to the star players of the team and the huge rallies and favourable poll numbers, the Obama campaign is counting far more on basic fundamentals of the game to win: the ground game, including Obama's heavily wired multi-state organisation, get-out-the-vote efforts, neighbour-to-neighbour initiatives and the historic voter-registration drives that have already permanently altered the electoral map. Basketball is a team sport, and Obama is relying heavily on his team to keep their opponents off his back while he drives for the score.</p> <p>In basketball the most important aspect of the game is the clock. At the end of the game there is a buzzer and then it's over. For the US, that buzzer is election day, and all the polls and rallies in the world don't matter if the buzzer sounds while you're still down a point or two.</p> <p>Obama will run the clock just like any good basketball coach would. When you're ahead and there's only two minutes left in the game, every shot counts, every possession counts and you can expect plenty of fouls by the frustrated opposition to try to break your rhythm and stop your momentum. You bring in your best players \u2013 <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gGn1Qiwx3uBAtrv66H46rHWSYoZQ\">Bill and Hillary Clinton</a>, Joe Biden and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/09/michelle-obama-makes-idai_n_133232.html\">Michelle Obama</a> \u2013 and let them work out those fouls for you while you keep control of the ball and the initiative. And then you wait for the other team to throw that wild full-court shot right at the buzzer \u2013 for all the good it will do them.</p> <p>'Cause Obama got game.</p>",
  "<p>The Baltic Dry shipping index, which has been flashing amber signals about the world economy for the past couple of months, is telling us there is something going badly wrong because it is now stuck firmly on red.</p> <p>The index, a proxy for world trade flows, suffered its second biggest-ever fall yesterday, to 11%, which took it down under the $2,000 mark and it fell another 8% today to $1,809. The drop means it has fallen more than 80% since July's peak of around $12,000 and is now at a three-year low.</p> <p>The index has long been seen as a good leading indictor of future economic production levels because it charts the cost of freight movements in 26 of the world's biggest shipping lanes of \"dry\" materials, such as coal, iron ore and grain which feed into the production of finished goods some weeks or months ahead.</p> <p>Think back to the first part of the year and there was a boom in oil and commodities prices, which pushed up demand for the ships to carry them. Now we seem to be stuck in the bust phase. We know that oil and commodity prices have fallen sharply because demand has faded in the face of high prices and because the world economy is being deflated by the global financial crisis.</p> <p>There is some hope today that the worst of the financial crisis may be over, thanks to the mass injections of capital into banks by governments in Europe and the US. But the damage to the world economy is already a fact of life and the Baltic Dry is pointing to a further slowdown in both output and inflation in many of the world's economies.</p> <p>The index may also be telling us something scarier. It may be telling us that the world's great industrial powerhouse, China, could be in trouble and that its imports of raw materials are collapsing at a far greater pace than the slow slide in demand from the West for China's finished goods would imply.</p> <p>There have been increasing concerns about China this year. It has been booming for years and growing, if the official figures are to be believed, at more than 10% a year. That has, in turn, given rise to a stockmarket and housing market boom which now look to be going pop, as ours have done.<br>The great Asian miracle economy might now be coming apart at the seams, in spite of the official figures suggesting everything is stillfine.

  "<p>London's top shares continued to rally today but early hopes of another bumper rise petered out by the close of trading. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 index of leading companies closed up 3.2% or 137.3 points at 4394.2, an increase that was a relatively modest follow-up to yesterday's 325-point leap back from the abyss.</p> <p>At one point, the blue-chip index had climbed as high as 4534.4, up 277.5 points, which would have represented the fourth biggest one-day climb on record.</p> <p>A record gain in Japan's Nikkei index overnight and the Dow Jones industrial average's biggest ever points increase had propelled the FTSE 100 higher.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.marcusgarvey.com/\">Marcus Garvey</a> was born in Jamaica. During the 1920s his Universal Negro Improvement Association had 20 million members worldwide, making it the biggest black mass movement in history. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIiae5Pu234\">Garvey's project</a> was to bring the black peoples of Africa and the diaspora back in touch with the modern world, after they had been cut off by slavery and colonialism. He felt that black people historically were once masters of the universe, slavery was \"a mere interruption\", and now it was time for black people to organise like other ethnic groups and build a strong power base.</p> <p>He led black Americans out of the wilderness of self-hatred and despair. In an age of global independence, Garvey was ahead of his time. He saw the future world being divided into racial and economic blocks. A world where there would never be a G8 without a black face. </p> <p>When Garvey shouted \"Up you mighty race\", he was never a black version of the BNP. He was simply reminding his oppressed audience that their ancestors (from Africa and the Nile) were the source energy for all mankind. </p> <p>Garvey was adamant that black people should be at the forefront of everything, particularly technology. It was his legacy that inspired me to set up my programme <a href=\"http://www.generatinggenius.org.uk/about_uk.html\">Generating Genius</a>, which seeks to help bright black boys from deprived backgrounds find their way into science, medicine or engineering at university. The programme has been successful both here and in Jamaica. </p> <p>Black and white children in Britain would benefit from knowing the Garvey story. He was the first to construct a new ideal for Africans in Europe and America: free from mental slavery, anti-intellectualism, victim mentality and self-hate. It isn't surprising that fellow Jamaican Bob Marley, who sang Garvey's words \"emancipate yourself from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds\", would keep the Garvey legacy alive.</p>",
  "<p>Blame for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketturmoil\">global banking crisis</a> is variously apportioned to greedy bankers, lax supervision and incompetent management.</p> <p>But many of the financial industry's excesses flow directly from the political cover given to its activities, especially in the US and Britain, since the Thatcher and Reagan years in the 1980s. </p> <p>Within a year of Big Bang in 1986, when the City was deregulated, it became conventional wisdom to believe that management of the economy was best left to global market forces. The mantra of the market became even more pronounced when the Berlin Wall fell in 1990 and the Soviet empire collapsed soon afterwards. </p> <p>Western capitalism had triumphed in the life-and-death struggle against communism; what is more, the capitalism that emerged victorious was the red-in-tooth-and-claw variety that believed in unfettered free markets where a huge derivatives industry (mortgage-backed securities being but one small part) was allowed to grow up largely unchecked and unsupervised.</p> <p>After the crisis of recent weeks and months, few believe that capitalism isn't in need of urgent reform. A return to the protectionism and nationalism of the 1930s would be to see the pendulum swing too far the other way. But expect some fairly major adjustments, not tweaks around the edges, in the months and years ahead.</p>",
  "<p>I'm afraid I missed the press conference for foreign press this morning where Gordon Brown was asked how it felt to be regarded a superhero. I was at a Lib Dem briefing instead, but Nick Clegg never gets questions about being perceived as the saviour of the global capitalism.</p> <p>Jim Pickard from the FT has a nice post about the Brown appearance <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2008/10/hes-not-the-messiah-hes-just-a-prime-minister/\">here.</a> Clegg's news conference was rather different, but what the two events show is that everyone at Westminster is currently obsessed with trying to work out who's going benefit politically from the banking crisis.</p> <p>Let's start with the Tories. The best guide to their official thinking on this is a post that has gone up on the <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/torydiary/2008/10/tories-prepare.html\">ConservativeHome website.</a></p> <p>ConservativeHome is virtually an official party noticeboard and some of the comments I found hard to take at face value. For example, I couldn't read the line \"the Tory leadership was unfazed by recent events\" without thinking: \"They are fazed by recent events.\" </p> <p>And \"the Tories are not worried about being largely out of the news\" also sounded hard to swallow. If so, what was David Cameron doing on the Jeremy Vine show this afternoon?</p> <p>But the key message did sound more plausible. It was this:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Tory leadership hopes and expects the recapitalisation package to succeed in stabilising the banking sector. But the leadership does not expect that Brown will win any long-term credit for any of this. Brown, we were told, will soon be seen to have saved the banks but not averted recession and there aren't many votes in that. They are cataloguing evidences of Labour \"triumphalism\" at recent events for later use.</p> <p>And this is the key: The Tories are going to present themselves as the people to rescue the \"real economy\". They are convinced that Brown will not connect with voters who start losing their homes and jobs next year. \"He is incapable of empathy\".</p> </blockquote> <p>As for Brown, he clearly knows that being praised by the winner of the Nobel prize for economics as the saviour of the world's financial system doesn't mean he's going to win the next election. At the briefing, when asked if he was now \"Flash Gordon\", he said he wasn't. \"Just Gordon, I can assure you,\" he said.</p> <blockquote> <p>I think you should look at what they were saying about me four weeks ago \u2026 Politics, I have found, is about ups and downs, and you have got to treat adversity and periods of popularity with equal equanimity.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of the recent polls have been very favourable. But, as I mentioned on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2008/oct/13/gordonbrown-polls\">a blog yesterday,</a> if you look beneath the headlines at the underlying findings of the latest YouGov survey, they're still pretty grim for Labour.</p> <p>And as for the Lib Dems? When I asked Clegg for his assessment, he came out with this:</p> <blockquote> <p>I think this banking crisis will be to this parliament what the Iraq war was to the last parliament. It will be the biggest issue by far and the response of the political parties will be as important to their credibility in the eyes of the public as was their response to the invasion of Iraq. I think it is revealing that on both these issues, the Liberal Democrats stand apart from Labour and the Conservatives in calling it right well before either of the other two parties realised the enormity of what the country was entering into. </p> </blockquote> <p>Clegg is entitled to say that Vincent Cable was banging on about the levels of debt in the economy long before it became fashionable.

  "<p>A proposal for a giant global fund to pay the owners of the world's forests not to cut them down has received a guarded welcome from environmental groups. They warn of the risks of giving rich nations a cheaper alternative to cutting their own greenhouse gas emissions and to the human rights of the tens of millions of people who live in or who depend on forests for their livelihoods. </p> <p>The independent report, revealed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/14/greenpolitics-climatechange\">the Guardian</a>, was written for the prime minister, Gordon Brown, and states that an international carbon market could prevent the deforestation that is a major contributor to climate change and inject much needed funds into poor countries.</p> <p>The report calls for an international agreement to halve the carbon dioxide released through deforestation by 2020. It acknowledges this will be costly but estimates such action could be worth $3.7tr (\u00a32.1tr) to the world's nations in net benefits over the long term. If nothing is done to slow rampant deforestation, the report states, the resulting climate change will cause impacts costing governments nearly $1tr a year by 2100. </p> <p>The report was written by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Eliasch\">Johan Eliasch</a>, a businessman appointed by Brown to be his special adviser on forests. Deforestation is responsible for at least 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing it is seen as one of the quickest and cheapest ways of cutting emissions. </p> <p>The report recommends that forests be included in the emerging global carbon market. By giving standing trees a carbon value, it says, \"the cost of halving global carbon emissions could be reduced by up to 50% in 2030\". </p> <p>The Eliasch review acknowledges it could take at least five years before the global carbon market is operating and that not all countries would currently agree to such a system. </p> <p>It notes that countries that would benefit from international payments to protect their forests should be required to comply with international agreements that require them to respect human rights and to protect the environment. </p> <p>The countries that might benefit are some of the most politically volatile, and \u2013 in many cases \u2013 corrupt in the world. It says that in the short term the international community should pay up to $4bn to 40 forest countries to help them reach acceptable standards of governance. </p> <p>Environmentalists welcomed the report as a sign of deforestation being taken seriously by governments, and agree the issue must be tackled, but urge caution over how it is done. \"Sufficient and long-term funding is needed to act as an incentive to protect forests,\" said Emily Brickell, climate and forests officer for <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/\">WWF-UK</a>. </p> <p>But protecting the needs of people was also paramount, she said: \"More than one billion of the world's poorest people rely on forests for their livelihoods, so any measures to reduce emissions from deforestation must ensure that local communities enjoy continued access to, and benefits from, forest resources.\"</p> <p>Andy Tait, Greenpeace's head of biodiversity, expressed concern over the effect the plan would have on emissions in rich nations. \"If Gordon Brown accepts these proposals he will give a green light to companies to use forest protection abroad as a cheap alternative to making the dramatic cuts in the industrial and energy sectors that we need here in the UK. Allowing forests to become a get-out-of-jail-free card for the big polluters would be extremely bad news in the fight against climate change.\"</p> <p>The reliability of the carbon market is also a key factor, said Simon Counsell, director of the <a href=\"http://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/\">Rainforest Foundation UK</a>: \"There is a serious danger of placing excessive hope in what might be very unreliable and speculative forest protection carbon credits. </p> <p>\"Avoided deforestation carbon credits might well turn out to be sub-prime, as weak tropical country governments fail to deliver actual reductions in deforestation, or as forests increasingly become susceptible to fire and disease because of the warming effects of climate change itself. Trading off our own emissions against hoped-for reductions in deforestation could be a catastrophic lose-lose strategy.\" </p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/\">Friends of the Earth</a>'s international climate campaigner Tom Picken, the plan does not address the deeper causes of deforestation: \"Financial packages are needed \u2013 but we must also address the underlying causes, such as biofuels, excessive meat consumption and industrial logging.\"</p> <p>Under the proposed scheme countries would be rewarded with carbon credits, which could be exchanged for cash on the global market, for not cutting down forests and for reforesting previously logged areas. While the international community would monitor forest loss via satellite, it would be left to national governments to decide how money earned would be distributed and what measures would be needed to prevent illegal logging. </p> <p>The review says countries could tackle deforestation in different ways. The most controversial would be to pay logging companies not to fell trees, or subsistence farmers not to clear land. In addition, countries could greatly increase their policing of forests or could tax heavily anyone who clears forest.</p> <p>But it accepts that halting deforestation will be difficult. \"Such delegation [of responsibility] will involve significant costs ... which may be very challenging for many forest nations in the short term. Demonstration activities to test these approaches will be needed.\" It accepts there are significant human rights and land-ownership risks.</p> <p>\"Risks include increased state and outside expert control over forests, support for anti-people conservation and land speculation\", says the report.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Rob Carnell</strong>, analyst at <strong>ING Financial Markets</strong>, said the reaction of the three-month Libor rates - at which banks lend to each other - would determine whether the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/us-banks-bailout-bush\">measures announced by the US government</a> were successful or not.</p> <p>\"Today's moves bring the US into line with the UK and Europe, and provide a solid global approach to the financial market crisis. Encouragingly, three-month interbank rates declined for the second day running. This, and other measures of financial sector distress, is how we will be able to judge the success or otherwise of the current measures over coming weeks and months.\"</p> <p><strong>David Resler</strong>, the chief economist at <strong>Nomura Securities</strong>, said the US package had reassured the markets that the financial system would not be left to collapse.</p> <p>\"Clearly the markets are relieved by these actions,\" he said. \"Everybody in these markets had come to the realisation you needed to have something radical to restore trust and confidence among banks. Many of the banks weren't real keen on taking this capital infusion from the government, but they recognised it had to be all or none.</p> <p>\"We're in a period of economic stagnation and contraction, it's probably going to last another few months and into next year, but at the same time this is happening we should be a little encouraged by the drop of oil prices we've had recently.\" </p> <p><strong>Subodh Kumar</strong>, a strategist at <strong>Subdoh Kumar &amp; Associates</strong>, said there was likely to still be some volatility ahead but a slow recovery should be on the cards in the near future.</p> <p>\"I think the markets will continue to show recovery today, though maybe not at the same rate as yesterday. Volatility going forward is likely to continue. Also, these capital injections come at a cost. Credit is still clearly not freely available. It's possible or likely that the Friday numbers were the low, but I'll leave calling that a bottom to others.</p> <p>\"I think a major fear people had was that this would become political, but because it is a global move, there is clearly no political agenda.\"</p> <p><strong>Robert Andres</strong>, strategist at <strong>Portfolio Management Consultants</strong>, was less optimistic about the effect the rescue package would have.</p> <p>\"This is still 'whack-a-mole.' They sold this to the public so poorly. This one-a-day pill is insanity. This does not instill confidence. Now they are giving the money to the banks and some of them didn't want it. They have taken us away from the risk of a systemic collapse, but it could be managed better. Everything seems reactionary and random. </p> <p>\"They need to explain to the public why credit and liquidity are important. Liquidity is synonymous with confidence. Everything is frozen without confidence.\"</p> <p>He said the government should introduce a massive fiscal package that creates jobs and invests in infrastructure. \"Right now the public are not getting the bang for their dollars. We are spending a lot of empty calories which are not going to create a lot of jobs.\" </p> <p><strong>Jim Awad</strong>, the chairman of <strong>WP Stewart &amp; Co</strong>, said the bank plan was another step in the right direction.</p> <p>\"The markets have been looking for it and they're reacting positively to it,\" he said. \"I expect it to add to the series of efforts that will add stability to the financial and credit markets, but it's important to not get overly euphoric, because we still have to enforce it. It's like, if someone has a heart attack, they can't go out jogging the next day. I would put the financial system on the rehabilitation stage. There's been damage done.\"</p> <p><strong>Kevin Logan</strong>, economist at <strong>Dresdner Kleinwort </strong>said: \"One of the important things is guaranteeing bank debt. It will have an immediate impact - banks have not been able to roll over their debt recently and that compromises or interferes with their funding and makes them less secure overall and it is a downward spiral. So by guaranteeing the debt, they will now be able to roll over debt and that will keep them funded. So that immediately alleviates a lot of the problems.\"</p>",

  "<p>Last Friday the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/11/business/11scene.html\">quoted</a> the World Bank as saying \"There's no question the Washington consensus is dead,\" indeed it \"died at the time of the $700bn bail-out.\" If the bail-out is death, then awarding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2008/oct/13/economics\">Paul Krugman</a> the Nobel prize for economics is the nail in the coffin.</p> <p>Paul Krugman did not win the Nobel for his popular critiques of Bush-era economic policy in his <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html\">New York Times column</a>, though the column no doubt helped raise his profile outside the economics profession. The Nobel committee cited Krugman's theoretical contributions to the economics of international trade, the policy implications of which fly in the face of the Washington consensus ( where themantra is to free up trade every chance you get).</p> <p>Among Krugman's achievements in the field of international trade is \"strategic trade policy\". In this work Krugman (and others) showed that tariffs and subsidies to domestic industries can divert profits away from highly concentrated foreign firms and increase a nation's income. Though Krugman himself shies away from prescribing such policy, the textbook example of strategic trade theory is the choice by the Brazilian government to subsidise and develop the aircraft company <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embraer\">Embraer</a>.</p> <p>The free-trade theories espoused by the Washington consensus would warn Brazil of the high cost of subsidisation. To free traders, Brazil should focus on its advantage in agricultural products and forget about climbing the manufacturing ladder. Strategic trade theory helps explain why Brazil was willing to gamble in the short term to become one of the finest aircraft manufactures over the long term. They squeezed foreign firms out of the market and carved out a global niche for themselves.</p> <p>In another classic book, Development, Geography, and Economic Theory, Krugman argued that the government should also play a role in connecting beneficiaries of strategic trade policy to the overall economy. Evoking the work of economists such as Albert O Hirschman and Paul Rosenstein Rodan, Krugman argued that developing countries often needed a \"big push\" of coordinated government investments to help strategic industries get off the ground and to link the growth of such industry to the economy as a whole.</p> <p>Problem is, today's trading system is out of whack with these frontier issues in economic thought. In a <a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/pardee/publications/Pardee-Paper-002-Trade/index.shtml\">study</a> published by Boston University's Pardee Centre for the Study of the Longer-Range Future, trade lawyer Rachel Denae Thrasher and I examined the extent to which the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements, European Union trade agreements, and United States trade agreements bit into a nation's ability to deploy strategic trade and other industrial policies to benefit from the globalisation process.</p> <p>We find that in general the world's trading system makes it much more difficult for nations to craft strategic trade and industrial policies for growth and development. Indeed, enshrined in virtually all trade agreements is the \"national treatment\" idea that says a nation may not treat its domestic industries any differently than foreign ones. That may make sense when rich nations compete against each other, but in a world where 57.6% of the population lives on less than $2.50 per day, one size can't fit all. This restriction is accentuated in provisions for foreign investment, intellectual property, and subsidies.</p> <p>Interestingly however, we find that there is more \"policy space\" for innovative growth strategies under the WTO than under most regional trade agreements \u2013 especially those pushed by the US. In fact, we find that US-style trade agreements are the most severe in constraining the ability of developing countries to deploy such policy. EU agreements, interestingly, tend to have the same policy space as the WTO.</p> <p>It doesn't make sense that the World Bank and (implicitly) the Nobel committee are declaring the death of the Washington consensus when the US is choking the ability of nations to use policies that are gaining increasing legitimacy in theory and practice. Change is in the air. As we know in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the US has justified \u2013 like never before \u2013 a strong role for government in economic affairs. And, of the two presidential candidates, Obama has expressed concern over the direction of US trade policy and has pledged to rethink it. Perhaps these events will make strategic trade and industrial policy rise again.</p>",
  "<p>As the government warned that 12 universities had \u00a377m in collapsed Icelandic banks, the new higher education minister, David Lammy, said universities would have to consider merging or becoming federations in the future.</p> <p>In his first address to university officials today at Universities UK's conference on the future size and shape of higher education, Lammy asked: \"Do you have the right number of institutions? In the commercial sector there would have to be many mergers over the next few decades \u2013 far more than we have seen in higher education. Could more be done to encourage that among universities?\"</p> <p>Lammy's remarks came just before universities secretary, John Denham, told parliament that \"no university is at risk as a result of its exposure to Icelandic banks\".</p> <p>Denham added: \"Clearly this is a serious matter for each of these universities, and officials from HM Treasury are engaging with them and the Higher Education Funding Council for England about their concerns,\" he said in a statement to parliament.</p> <p>\"However, it should be noted that Hefce has concluded that no university is at risk as a result of its exposure to Icelandic banks. </p> <p>\"Certainly no university faces a level of exposure that would raise questions about its continuing solvency.</p> <p>\"Students, businesses, charities and others may deal with universities with exactly the same level of confidence as before.\"</p> <p>Lammy told UUK delegates that it would be \"surprising\" if there were no changes to the current map of institutions over the next 10 to 15 years \u2013 \"not necessarily mergers but new forms of partnerships or federations\", he said.</p> <p>Lammy also talked about a \"greater specialisation\" of universities, which would mean \"choices about withdrawing from activities, choices which may be uncomfortable ones for those who have grown used to thinking about a traditional model of university\".</p> <p>Universities will need to reach out to more part-time students and adults in the workplace. That will pose challenges for universities and mean more provision off campus and new technologies, he said.</p> <p>\"The key challenge will be achieving diversification without diminishing the quality on which some of that success depends.\"</p> <p>\"There's no single shape for excellence in this country. Diversity of mission and approach is another of the great strengths of our universities,\" he added.</p> <p>Lammy said it was an \"important part of his job\" to raise the global reputation of universities and help them adapt to changing circumstances.</p> <p>\"You shouldn't expect the hail storm of initiatives from above you have at times, and understandably, complained about in the past,\" he said. \"I see universities as a powerful positive force for our society and I want to see them in the vanguard of that process.\"</p> <p>He added that universities needed to do more to get money from outside sources, such as alumni.</p> <p>Lammy went through Clearing to get a place to read law at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London because he had done \"much better\" in his exams than he thought he would.</p> <p>\"It's humbling and wonderful to be back here 20 years later as higher education minister, coming from a background like mine, raised by a single mother and the first in my family to go to university,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I know the freedom and perspectives education gives you, the huge opportunities to meet interesting people. I'm a product of that experience so I feel I know what higher education has done and is required to do for this country.\"</p> <p>Lammy said he picked up an appetite for learning and went on to become the first black Briton to go to Harvard Law School, from which he regularly receives letters asking for money.</p> <p>\"The government has promised \u00a3200m to leverage funding from voluntary giving. That gives you a great opportunity,\" he said.</p>",

He said: \"Historically a giant rally doesn't get the same follow through as normal days.\"</p> <p>But he thinks \"the FTSE 100 will rise today but after that I'm not sure how much higher it will go in the short term\". </p> <p>He said the new banking package being discussed in the US \"will get a lot closer to the real issue \u2014 lack of capital\" than the controversial $700bn plan drawn up by treasury secretary Henry Paulson, which allows the government to buy toxic debt from banks. \"A lot of commentators are saying this is what the US should have been doing in the first place,\" he said.</p> <p>While the $700bn bail-out was \"very much opposed by the American public,\" it should be easier to pass the government's new plan to buy stakes in major financial institutions. \"Britain has already paved the way. The public understood and accepted it,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The problem is lack of transparency in the market,\" he said. \"Banks are unwilling to lend to each other because they don't know what other banks are exposed to. Banks also have big credit lines to hedge funds\" which are lightly regulated.</p> <p>\"What would change things is if the banks were forced to disclose sub-prime mortgages and exact holdings of various derivatives,\" he said.</p> <h2>Howard Wheeldon at BGC Partners</h2> <p>Wheeldon, a senior strategist, thought that after yesterday's rally on Wall Street and big rises in Asian stocks overnight, the FTSE 100 could rise by about 250 points today.</p> <p>\"What we are seeing is relief that one big chunk of the jigsaw has been found and put in place,\" he said.</p> <p>\"No doubt the remedies for solving the capital markets problem are now firmly in place in the US, UK and almost right across Europe,\" he said. \"But now the fear moves on to the depth and totality of a likely recession and how contracted it will be. The relief rally is very justified but concerns will switch very quickly to the weakness of the UK economy.</p> <p>\"This will weigh on markets for the rest of the year and 2009. Our lifestyle has to change. Things will never be the same again.\" </p> <p>It could be many years before financial markets recovered from the current crisis, said Wheeldon.</p> <p>He believed \"we should take it as a given\" that the US government would follow Britain and the rest of Europe in taking stakes in US banks. \"It will only be temporary. It may last one to two years. I can't see it lasting longer than that in the US.\"</p> <h2>Justin Urquhart Stewart at Seven Investment Management</h2> <p>\"The Allies strike back. It may not be the beaches of Normandy but these actions are the first concerted counter attack against the evil forces of gloom and doom. The battle may not be won yet but the auguries are encouraging. However, don't be fooled, the enemy is not yet beaten and the war not won. This will continue for some months yet, but at least we have landed on the beaches.</p> <p>\"The US has now also signalled a willingness to buy stakes in banks to achieve recapitalisation, but concerns remain that the US measures seen so far do not specifically address the issue of medium-term financing for bank. This is a crucial area that must be solved before money markets can unfreeze. </p> <p>\"The actions taken now must work, there is no other remedy available \u2014 the alternative does not bear contemplation. However, for some time we believed that the recession we face is likely to be very serious, probably at least as bad as the early 1990s recession and maybe more intense and of longer duration. We have not yet seen anything to shake that view. </p> <p>\"Although the government has said it wants bank lending to continue at 2007 levels, one must ask how sensible that is, since profligate credit creation is exactly what got us into this mess in the first place. Indeed, some governments should consider how their own borrowing record, with an emulation of Enron and WorldCom type of off-balance-sheet gearing has contributed to the debt-fuelled economy. </p> <p>\"It is our belief that this crisis will only be fully resolved when the excess indebtedness in the consumer sector as well as the financial sector and government has been worked through. For consumer-driven economies that spells a long period of below trend growth.\"</p> <h2>Analysts at ING</h2> <p>The analysts said risk aversion was subsiding, pointing to \"welcome signs that Japanese investors believe that the worst is over in the global credit crunch\". </p> <p>Turning to the eurozone rescue plans, they said: \"Equity markets have rallied, while at the same time interbank lending rates have fallen, especially at the very short end. Nevertheless, looking at the details of all national plans so far leaves the impression that the devil is in the detail. </p> <p>\"The most pressing unanswered questions seem to refer to the guarantees. Presented under the label of 'guarantees for the interbank lending market', their scope seems to be somewhat broader as most detailed national plans refer to the issuance of new bank senior debt. </p> <p>\"This new debt does not necessarily have to be raised in the interbank market. Furthermore, the timing of the implementation of the plans is not fully clear, yet. Many government plans will have to be approved by national parliaments before they will become effective. Finally, there remains the question whether other governments, especially the US government, will also provide guarantees for interbank lending. </p> <p>\"All in all, the coordinated measures taken by the governments of the eurozone countries should be welcomed. The eurozone decision-making process has finally taken up speed, showing the determination to restore market confidence. Still, some details are still missing and the aftermath of the first Paulson plan has shown that any open questions should be solved quickly to restore confidence for good. Hopefully, eurozone policymakers keep their current momentum.\"</p> <h2>Moody's</h2> <p>The rating agency believes the banking rescue plans announced in the UK and the eurozone \"will collectively help to restore financial flows within the banking system\".</p> <p>\"With these announcements, Moody's considers that a substantial de-risking of the banking system is being achieved by providing significant capital and transferring banks' credit risk to their supporting governments for the period necessary to restore confidence and normal financial market operations,\" said Detlef Scholz, senior managing director.</p> <p>\"With implementation of this very clear systemic support, Moody's expects that bank debt and deposit ratings of large European banks will stabilise; capital and liquidity support, which was previously at issue, is now being secured. At the same time, Moody's does not expect widespread ratings upgrades. Selective rating actions (positive or negative) could still occur and would be driven primarily by long-term strategic and franchise considerations.\"</p>",

  "<p>Yes, I had money in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/oct/07/banks.savings\">IceSave</a>. And, as I search around to find someone to blame other than my own judgment, the Icelandic government and of course the global financial crisis, I can't help but think that their website had something to do with it. It's so slick, is the thing. The design is clean and clear, with the white spaces and rainbow-coloured single word logo so comfortingly reminiscent of everyone's online friend, Google. The site has fast response times and is laid out intuitively, with a helpful and extensive list of <a href=\"https://online.icesave.co.uk/OFIS/related/common.htm\">FAQs</a> and an easy to find Contact Us button which leads to <a href=\"http://www.icesave.co.uk/contact-us.html\">an actual telephone number</a>, rather than funnelling me to an online feedback system. Yes, IceSave's website is a model of customer-friendly design; it's a pity they don't have any money left.<br> It's rather embarrassing to realise that I was so swayed by site design. After all, I've been spotting online imposters, with the help of <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/\">Snopes</a>, for more than a decade now. <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/nothing/billgate.asp\">Bill Gates will give money to charity</a> if I forward this email? Don't make me laugh. You need me to <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/fraud/phishing/phishing.asp\">update my pin</a> due to identity theft? Pull the other one. <br> Add to this that the web-savvy reader or consumer is constantly being told to withhold trust. We all know that the person we're talking to online might not actually look like the picture they've posted of themselves \u2013 even if their aim isn't <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_fraud#Dating_scams\">out and out fraud</a>. And <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/oct/01/scamsandfraud.consumeraffairs\">phishing scams are steadily increasing</a>. One really ought to know by now not to use online presence as a guide to trustworthiness.<br> I have more reason than most to know that all that glisters online certainly isn't gold. For nearly three years, I was lead writer on alternate reality game <a href=\"http://www.perplexcity.com/\">Perplex City</a>, an online narrative which tried <a href=\"http://wayback.perplexcitystories.com/?url=www.perplexcitysentinel.com&amp;season=1\">as hard as possible</a> to <a href=\"http://wayback.perplexcitystories.com/?url=www.perplexcityrail.com/index.php&amp;season=1\">look real</a>. We occasionally succeeded too well. For our wrap party, we wanted to order some M&amp;Ms printed with the logo of a drug we'd invented, <a href=\"http://wayback.perplexcitystories.com/?url=www.cognivia.com/products/ceretin/\">Ceretin, a \"cognitive enhancer\"</a>. We had a call back from Mars after we'd placed the order, though. M&amp;Ms have a rule that they won't custom print their chocolates with the name of any drug; having checked <a href=\"http://wayback.perplexcitystories.com/?url=www.cognivia.com&amp;season=1\">our entirely fictional pharmaceuticals website</a>, they'd concluded that Ceretin was a real product and thus on their banned list. On the internet, it's all too easy to look like something you're not.<br> So I suppose, although it's entirely irrational, I'll be shying away from financial institutions with beautiful websites for a while. I'm starting to notice a trend, actually. <a href=\"http://www.northernrock.co.uk/\">Northern Rock's site</a> is pretty attractive in a white-on-black <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/images/2008/01/15/img_9293.jpg\">Steve Jobs presentation way</a>. Kaupthing Edge, as well as having a name that sounds like a midtown NYC extreme sports shop, has a funky bubble effect going on in the <a href=\"http://www.kaupthingedge.co.uk/\">background of its site</a> rather reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.o2.co.uk/business/sme/whyo2forbusiness/whyshouldyouchooseo2?cm_re=BusinessArea-_-SMEbox2-_-Whyo2ForBusiness\">O2</a>. IceSave's design makes other institutions like <a href=\"https://www.mybank.alliance-leicester.co.uk/index.asp?ct=mybankrhnlogin&amp;\">Alliance &amp; Leicester</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nationwide.co.uk/\">Nationwide</a> look clunky and old fashioned. But then, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Nationwide haven't gone bust. Perhaps, in this era of decreased trust all round, ugly website design is going to stage a resurgence.</p>",
  "<p>So as Scotland's banks take a pummelling on the stock markets, so too do Alex Salmond's dreams of Scottish independence. At least that's how it appears.<br><br>The vast scale of the emergency bail-out of the Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS has, say Labour, the Tories and prominent unionist commentators, dramatically wounded Salmond's case for taking Scotland out of the UK. </p> <p>It is simple arithmetic, they say: the two institutions have been given \u00a332bn and access to more. The Scottish government has a total budget of \u00a331bn and even with North Sea oil and independence, would be bankrupted by that bail-out.</p> <p>The Times' Scottish political editor, Angus Macleod, writes today that the crisis has exposed Salmond's \"separatist fantasies\" and describes his efforts to make capital out of the crisis as \"pathetic\". Alan Cochrane in the Daily Telegraph suggests this \"economic calamity\" will make the union \"even more essential for Scots\".</p> <p>Salmond's critics see it as a humiliation for the first minister. Salmond was an economist with both RBS and the Scottish Office (as was). That history gifted him one of the great propaganda coups of the May 2007 election campaign, when he unveiled Sir George Mathewson, then the recently-retired chairman of RBS, as a fan of independence.</p> <p>But now the banking model that Mathewson helped forge with Sir Fred Goodwin at RBS - creating the banking monster which last year generated \u00a310bn in profits and helped underpin Scotland's economy - has been destroyed.</p> <p>And Mathewson is now chair of Salmond's council of economic advisors, a body whose influence is dwarfed by the global financial crisis. </p> <p>Salmond's senior adviser has rebuffed demands from journalists for an explanation of how an independent Scotland would have defended its banks from collapse: they wouldn't \"speculate on a theoretical future event\", he said. </p> <p>And Salmond retorts that Norway, secured by a \u00a3200bn oil fund from its North Sea revenues, had found \u00a335bn for its banking bail-out. Suggestions that small nations are inherently insecure are \"fanciful\", he says. </p> <p>Yet Salmond's favoured phrase about the \"arc of prosperity\" across northern Europe is now gleefully twisted by his opponents, most recently the new Scottish secretary, Jim Murphy.</p> <p>That chain of small nations that Salmond has repeatedly cited as proof that small is indeed beautiful \u2013 a chain that included Ireland, Norway, and Iceland \u2013 is now the \"arc of insolvency\". </p> <p>So, after 17 months of climbing poll ratings, often-brilliant policy management and government largely untroubled by any effective opposition, Salmond seems in serious trouble.</p> <p>So too, it now seems, are his hopes of winning the proposed independence referendum on St Andrew's Day in 2010. I'm not sure that this will vex Salmond greatly. </p> <p>This banking crisis (particularly since the two Scottish banks are partly owned now by a London-run state) is undoubtedly a blow to the SNP's confidence and Salmond's boundless self-esteem. I don't believe Salmond was even certain he could stage the referendum, let alone win it. </p> <p>Now that Wendy Alexander's proposal to back the referendum bill is dead, there are serious obstacles in its way. </p> <p>There are mutterings about legal challenges to its legitimacy. With a new leader in place, Iain Gray, and Gordon Brown more focused on Scotland, Labour in Holyrood are now increasingly confident and showing greater strength of purpose. </p> <p>Suggestions that the new Lib Dem leader, Tavish Scott, was veering towards a deal on the referendum \u2013 by making it a multi-option bill to allow voters to back greater powers for Holyrood \u2013 are now subsiding.</p> <p>Yet, for some senior SNP figures, losing a referendum bill to the unionists would be better for the nationalists: a denial of the nation's will gives them a stronger grievance to build on for the 2011 Holyrood elections. And winning in 2011 is the real goal.</p> <p>Imagine, for now, that by then a Tory government is in power in London, with at most only two or three Scottish seats after the 2010 general election. It is highly unlikely to expand much energy on placating nationalism. More grit and grist to the SNP mill. </p> <p>Salmond wants to build and strengthen the SNP's power base \u2013 he won last year with a single-seat lead over Labour. He wants to dominate Holyrood after 2011. He is no revolutionary; his \"gradualist\" recipe for independence relies on the SNP proving its credentials as a government and Scotland's capacity for autonomy within the European Union. </p> <p>Last year he said 2017 was his target date for independence, an apparently throwaway remark that revealed his actual ambition. </p> <p>And if he can prove to Scots that he has saved Scottish banking jobs in the HBOS-Lloyds merger and the wider crisis, then his central goal of portraying himself as Scotland's truest champion will be met. </p> <p>That will be his main focus. And with it, he hopes, will come victory in 2011, half the seats in Holyrood, and a far stronger platform for independence. Labour's job is to stop him.</p>",
  "<p>You've been wondering how Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster would fill the cavernous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tate-modern-turbine-hall\">Turbine Hall</a> for Tate Modern's ninth Unilever commission. After all, you were moved by the subtle interplay of light and shadow in S\u00e9ance de Shadow II, her contribution to Tate Modern's The World as a Stage exhibition, and you've seen all of those subdued films she made about the urban condition. What, you mused, would the Strasbourg-born artist deliver for her first public commission in the UK?</p> <p>You're ready to lavish praise on her Turbine Hall \"environment\", as her works are called, even though the project sounds suspiciously like a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/75859/thx.1138\">George Lucas film</a>: TH.2058. But casting an eye over today's papers prompts a quick rethink. The Daily Telegraph's Richard Dorment deems that Gonzalez-Foerster \"just wasn't up to the job\" and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/10/14/baunilever114.xml\">dismisses her new work</a> as \"too precious for words\" before he launches into a rather wordy tirade: \"The failure to integrate the different elements means that the piece lacks the doom laden atmosphere I think the artist intended, while the need to consult a wall label in order to understand what on earth is going on is also weakness in this particular kind of art.\"</p> <p>So what on earth is going on? For starters, you recognise some familiar artworks including one of your favourite previous Turbine Hall inhabitants \u2013 Louise Bourgeois's giant spider Maman \u2013 towering over rows of hostel-style bunk-beds. Deferring to <a href=\"http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article4938697.ece\">Rachel Campbell-Johnston in the Times</a>, you realise these are in fact \"faked copies\" and you can now also recognise \"Claes Oldenburg's oversized apple core\" in the room. They're 25% bigger than the original works but, siding with Campbell-Johnston, you announce that \"you have to play about far more bravely with scale if you want to create a dramatic effect\". Appraising Gonzalez-Foerster's flawed vision, you wager that Doris Salcedo's Shibboleth wasn't the only Turbine Hall work with cracks. </p> <p>You spot copies of classic science fiction texts strewn on the beds \u2013 Fahrenheit 451, The Drowned World \u2013 and recognise clips from Peter Watkins's The War Game in the big-screen montage of apocalyptic films. Campbell-Johnston tells you it's \"nothing more than \u2026 cobbled-together pastiche\" while the Independent's Arifa Akbar shares some context: \"The work is set 50 years in the future and is inspired by the idea of London under attack.\" Why is it so bright then, Arifa? \"Piercing lights refer to our surveillance culture.\" And what's that noise? \"Never-ending rain\", apparently. Oh \u2013 and the beds? \"A futuristic shelter for besieged Londoners.\"</p> <p>Declining Campbell-Johnston's surprising suggestion for a taste of the post-apocalyptic (\"tuck yourself up in a cosy cardboard box under a South Bank bridge\"), you agree with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/13/gonzalez-foerster-turbine-hall-tate\">Guardian's Adrian Searle</a> that all this is \"a meta-fiction, a gag about sculpture, a homage to favourite movies and books and to the plaintive voice of singer Arto Lindsay, whose sad bossa nova whispers from a radio attached to one of the bunks.\" You borrow one last time from Searle, summarising TH.2058 as \"an extended joke about the purpose of art and art galleries\", and then laugh heartily, change the topic and make a mental note to find out why the joke was so funny.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \"This is not an endwork; it allows the possibility that things continue\" (Apply French accent - that's Gonzalez-Foerster speaking) <br><strong>Don't say:</strong> Can't I have another go on the slide?<br><strong>The reviewers reviewed:</strong> Apocalypse row</p>",
  "<p>Banks have been partially nationalised. Several bankers have paid the price with their jobs and are leaving without pay-offs. But will banking really change? </p> <p>Few of the top bosses have expressed any real regret for the financial collapse. Sir Fred Goodwin yesterday admitted he was \"sad\" at leaving Royal Bank of Scotland, but refused to accept any personal blame for the \u00a320bn additional funding required by the hapless Edinburgh-based institution.</p> <p>Most bankers appear to see themselves as victims of a global financial rout that no-one could have predicted. They do not believe that the seeds of destruction were sown by their own aggressive expansion and risk-taking. Few seem to believe that anything much will change.</p> <p>Most executives have brushed off the government's admonition to follow responsible lending policies, keep offering loans to homebuyers and deal fairly with those who can't pay their mortgages. They talk about operating on commercial terms with the government, which should keep it at arm's length. </p> <p>What's more, while they all accept that bonuses are off the table this year, they do not rule them out for next. </p> <p>This is a mistake. The government will have a place on the board of the banks into which it has injected capital and it should use its influence to good effect. It would be a missed opportunity if the government does not use its intervention in the banking industry to shake up the way it operates. Ministers should insist on a back-to-basics approach to banking. </p> <p>They should impose some public policy goals on the banks to address those excluded from regular banking services. High street banks have pulled out of many poorer areas, leaving those residents subject to high interest charges from doorstep lenders. Banks need to forget about global domination and look to their own back yard. It's not exciting or adrenaline-fuelled, but it provides a better service for all of us. The government should not let this opportunity pass by.</p>",
  "<p>When I was in Alaska last month, several people told me they were afraid to speak about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> on the record, lest they invite retaliation from the governor's office or, God forbid, from the next vice-president. At the time, I didn't take such worries too seriously. As abominable a candidate as Palin is, it was hard for me to imagine vice-presidential staffers trying ruin the lives of private Wasilla citizens just because they had displeased her. But reading the official report of the investigation into the Palin abuse-of-power scandal known as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/11/us/politics/11trooper.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper\">Troopergate</a>, it seems that perhaps her critics were being more prudent than paranoid.</p> <p>As scandals go, Troopergate is absurdly picayune. According to the report, released Friday by the bipartisan legislative council that authorised the investigation, Palin and her husband <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/us/10trooper.html?ref=politics\">tried to use their political power to have her sister's ex-husband, state trooper Michael Wooten, fired from his job</a> and investigated for workers compensation fraud. They also pressed authorities to prosecute him for a moose shooting that was unlawful because of a technicality (the permit had been issued to his then-wife, who was with him at the time, rather than to Wooten, who pulled the trigger). The governor then fired Walt Monegan, the public safety commissioner, because he refused to get rid of Wooten, something he could not legally have done. This stuff is so ridiculously small it seems silly to even be writing about it, especially at time of multiplying global emergencies. </p> <p>Yet given that there is still a chance - albeit a diminishing one - that Palin could soon be in a position of national political power, it's worth looking at how she has exercised power in the past. As a window into how Palin might rule, Troopergate's very pettiness is what makes it so troubling. We're used to politicians who do favours for campaign contributors, who are too cozy with lobbyists and who resort to underhanded tactics against political foes. What we are not used to are politicians who use their offices to intervene in family quarrels and punish their relatives' personal enemies. For the last eight years, we've suffered under an administration that sees no difference between politics and governing. Palin is something arguably worse, a person who sees no difference between her private life and her public duties. Even Dick Cheney, after all, hasn't used his office to torment disfavoured former in-laws.</p> <p>Though Palin claims the report has exonerated her, that's an outright lie. It is true that it concluded that she was within her rights to fire Monegan, since the governor is allowed to replace department heads without cause. But it also found that Palin \"abused her power\" by violating the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act, which holds that any \"effort to benefit a personal or financial interest through official action\" is a violation of the public trust. </p> <p>More interesting than the report's conclusion, though, are its pitiful little details. There are endless haranguing phone calls to people throughout the bureaucracy demanding action against Wooten, even after the Palins are warned that their actions could get them in legal trouble. There are scenes of Todd Palin, who apparently spent a great deal of time working in no official capacity out of his wife's office, presenting Monegan with dirt on Wooten unearthed by a private investigator. We see Todd trying to bust his ex-brother-in- law for dropping his kids off at school and then at church in a patrol car (both times, it turns out Wooten had permission to use the vehicle for personal business). We learn that the judge presiding over Wooten's divorce from Palin's sister weighed the Palin family's vendetta against him in splitting up their assets, ruling that Wooten is likely to earn less in the future because his ex-wife's family \"have decided to take off with the guy's livelihood\".</p> <p>This is not, of course, the only case in which Palin has behaved like <a href=\"http://www.cwtv.com/shows/gossip-girl\">Gossip Girl</a>'s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blair_Waldorf\">Blair Waldorf</a>, mobilising her minions against those who've fallen from her good graces. One of the people enlisted against Wooten was Palin's legislative director John Bitney, a friend of hers since junior high school. Bitney later <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/palin_fired_aide_who_dated_wif.php\">angered Palin by having an affair with Debbie Richter</a>, who at the time was separated from Todd Palin's best friend. He was summarily fired. (Debbie Richter <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122092043531812813.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">has since become Debbie Bitney</a>).</p> <p>All this is, of course, pretty trivial stuff. But how terrifying to think of a vice-president - or a president - wielding the power of her office to settle such personal grudges. The Bush administration <a href=\"http://www.ronsuskind.com/newsite/articles/archives/000032.html\">has famously been described</a> as the reign of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayberry_Machiavelli\">Mayberry Machiavellis</a>. Palin promises something tawdrier still. Again, bad prime-time soap operas offer the best analogy. Could America survive the rule of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty_(TV_series)\">Mayberry Carringtons</a>?</p>",

  "<p>Life inside the square mile has been tough recently; we have heard that traders and bankers are suffering real mental distress. <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/global/article4893843.ece\">City workers</a> are flocking to private clinics for emerging mental health problems and addictions. They do have my sympathy.</p> <p>But those outside the City aren't immune to \"recession depression\". For the less well-off there really is a \"trickle-down effect\" from the top \u2013 a steady stream of job losses, home repossessions and high-cost debt. There's plenty of evidence that stressful life events like <a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/bookshop/details.asp?pubID=200\">losing your home</a> have a profound impact on your mental wellbeing, so I wasn't that surprised when my organisation, <a href=\"http://www.rethink.org/\">Rethink</a>, got the results back from a survey on life events that damage mental health. Nearly <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7662119.stm\">half of us</a> say getting our home repossessed would damage us mentally.</p> <p>Worryingly, repossessions are soaring; thousands of us could be facing this ultimate stressor and struggling with the consequences \u2013 anxiety, depression, or a severe mental illness like schizophrenia.</p> <p>Mental health charities like mine are inevitably concerned for those already mentally ill or in recovery. And that's a lot of people \u2013 the Office for National Statistics says 1 in 4 of us will have a mental health problem at some stage. For those already vulnerable losing a home could trigger a relapse. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a big rise in people seeing their doctor about mental health issues, whether those problems are new or existing. And at last I'm not the only one saying it, as just this week the <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUKTRE49839M20081009\">World Health Organisation</a> (WHO) echoed Rethink's concerns.</p> <p>But what help can these credit crunch victims expect? Mental health services are already stretched to capacity. When Rethink <a href=\"http://www.rethink.org/how_we_can_help/campaigning_for_change/opening_doors/your_treatment_your.html\">surveyed</a> its members recently, 68% weren't even getting the psychological therapies recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence.</p> <p>This week the WHO told us England's mental health services are the best in Europe, but don't be fooled into thinking that's the whole story. Measuring your health service by comparing it with other countries is not that helpful. More instructive is a comparison between our services for the physically and mentally unwell. The reality is if you've got a mental illness you'll get 10 times less spent on your care than someone with cancer. You'll probably wait longer for treatment, be treated on a shabbier ward and get a stigmatising label for your trouble. There's no doubt we've come a long way since the bad old days when we locked people up in asylums, but there's a long way to go before we can feel as though the problems are solved.</p> <p>I've been saying we need to plough more money into mental health services for a long time \u2013 but now they're facing rising demand in response to the financial meltdown I think it's time to start shouting it from the rooftops.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">Inflation</a> unexpectedly soared to 5.2% last month, the highest in 16 years, after power companies hiked gas and electricity bills. </p> <p>The annual rate in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/16/businessglossary\">consumer prices index (CPI)</a> was up from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/inflation.bankofenglandgovernor\">4.7% in August</a> and the highest since the series began in January 1997, official figures showed today. Economists had expected inflation to hit 5%. The figures are expected to mark the peak in the spiralling cost of living seen this year.</p> <p>The government faces paying out billions more in pensions and benefits after a separate measure, the headline retail prices index (RPI), rose to 5%. Each year, the RPI figure for September is used by the government to calculate the next year's increases in the state pension and other benefits.</p> <p>The main reason consumer price inflation topped 5% for the first time was sharp rises in utility bills. Electricity prices were 30.3% higher on a year ago while gas prices soared by 49.9%. The annual rate of inflation for energy and other household bills hit 15%, the highest since January 1989.</p> <p>However, food inflation, another key source of price pressures this year, slowed for the first time since March as dairy prices fell. The annual rate dropped to 12.7% from 14.5%. </p> <p>David Page, economist at Investec, said: \"The power company hikes have pushed inflation above 5%, as we expected. However, we see this as the peak in inflation and retreats in energy prices should see inflation fall back relatively sharply over the next year.\" </p> <p>The Bank of England said last week when it joined in the emergency global <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interestrates\">interest rate cut</a> that although inflation could soon rise above 5%, the turmoil in financial markets had increased the downside risks to the economy and prices. Economists expect more rate cuts in coming months as tumbling oil and food prices feed through to inflation and the economy slides into recession. </p> <p>Nick Kounis at Fortis said: \"The outcome is unlikely to have come as a big surprise to the monetary policy committee, which is currently concerned that a severe downturn in the economy will lead to inflation undershooting its 2% target over the two-year horizon. As such, we continue to think that substantial further rate cuts are on the cards.\"</p> <p>The headline RPI, which is usually used in wage bargaining, reached 5% last month, the highest since July 1991. While this could lead to higher pay demands, rising unemployment is likely to restrict pay growth. </p> <p>The rise in the RPI spells good news for pensioners and those receiving benefits. September's RPI is commonly used by the government to calculate pension increases for the coming year. Pensions usually rise by 2.5% or headline RPI, whichever is higher.</p> <p>The government should increase the state pension by more than the official inflation rate to reflect the real increase in living costs faced by many pensioners, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/14/state-pension-pensions-inflation\">charities said today</a>. </p> <p>RPI, excluding costs such as rent, council tax and mortgage interest payments, is used to calculate increases in benefits such as jobseeker's allowance and income support. That measure - the so-called Rossi index - hit 6.3%. <br></p>",

  "<p><strong>Jeff Jarvis</strong> has taken me to task twice, in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/13/digital-media\">yesterday's print section</a>, and last week <a href=\"http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/10/08/it-is-our-fault/\">on his blog</a>, because he disagrees with my contention that journalists are not responsible for the decline of newspapers.</p> <p>I hold somewhat similar views to City University's <strong>Adrian Monck</strong>, both <a href=\"http://adrianmonck.com/2008/02/the-decline-of-newspapers-nothing-to-do-with-journalism/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://adrianmonck.com/2008/10/the-decline-of-newspapers-nothing-to-do-with-journalism-again/\">here</a>, and with the <strong>Washington Post</strong> writer <strong>Paul Farhi</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4623\">here</a>. A reminder of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2008/oct/03/1\">what I wrote</a>, as quoted by Jeff: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"There cannot be any doubt that journalists themselves... cannot be held responsible for either the financial woes of the industry nor for the public turning its back on the 'products' that contain their work... They are blameless.\"</p> <p>They have \"no reason to feel guilty... It isn't our fault... The truth is that we are being assailed by revolutionary technological forces completely outside of our control... You are not the cause of the current calamity.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I stand by every word, but Jeff says that I doth protest too much. He writes:<br> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"The fall of journalism is journalists' fault. It is our fault we did not see change coming soon enough and ready our craft for its transition. It is our fault we did not exploit - hell, too many resisted - the opportunities new media and new relationships with the public presented. </p> <p>\"It is our fault we lost readers and squandered trust. It is our fault we did not give adequate stewardship to journalism and left business to the business people. It is our fault we sat back and expected some princely patron to support us.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That assumes that journalists have power, that they could have exploited the opportunities of new media without the support (or otherwise) of newspaper owners and managers. In truth, in a newsprint media overwhelmingly controlled by large media companies, journalists have had no room to manoeuvre beyond the wishes, and pockets, of their employers. </p> <p>It is all very well to blame journalists for leaving business to the business people, but what was the alternative? In the 1970s, when I was an NUJ activist and a member of a Marxist party, I had a clear idea about workers seizing control of newspapers' editorial agenda. (And everything else, of course). </p> <p>That attempt, prefigured in the failed attempt to enforce an NUJ closed shop, sounds both crazily idealistic and, I readily concede, at the same time, madly illiberal and totalitarian. But the closed shop campaign, which united owners and editors (along with the majority of both Fleet Street and regional journalists), did prove beyond any shadow of doubt that media owners ruled the roost.</p> <p>Attempts to set up viable alternatives to the mainstream British press have failed hopelessly. The brief flowering of an agit-prop press in the early 1970s died. Later attempts (<strong>News on Sunday</strong>!) were always marginal. Big media has ruled.</p> <p>And it has ruled internally too. Journalists conform to the wishes of their owner-editor masters or take a hike. There has been room for some dissension within some papers (such as <strong>The Guardian</strong> and <strong>The Observer</strong>) but these have been very rare exceptions. </p> <p>The hierarchical power structure did not allow for much journalistic innovation before the rise of the internet. There has been a great deal since in almost every paper, but we're talking about the past here, about journalism's alleged former failures.</p> <p>It is plainly wrong to say that all old print journalism was bad (and got us into the economic mess the industry faces) just as it would be wrong to say that all new media journalism is good. The journalism of the former era, that was carried within the newsprint paradigm, has nothing to be ashamed of.</p> <p>Yes, there were bad journalists and bad journalism. Yes, we can now see that it was top-down journalism, with us acting as gatekeepers to the news. But I think I see why Jeff has got this so wrong. Britain's journalists, unlike America's, were never as pompous and po-faced as their US counterparts. Seen from a British context, Jeff's assault makes almost no sense.</p> <p>Even among the bone-headed print dinosaurs who refuse to acknowledge the coming demise of print there are journalists who have made valuable contributions to our trade (and go on doing so). Similarly, there are plenty of enthusiastic digital converts who probably do not rank among the finest of our ilk.</p> <p>As for Jeff's argument about the squandering of trust, that has been a long-run phenomenon, arguably dating back to the invention of newsprint. However, once again, I think there has been a difference between the US and British experiences.</p> <p>But let me turn away now from a defence of journalism past because I agree that the journalism of the future is what counts, and I'm therefore with Jeff when he says that our task is to use the new tools to create a new, and better, form of journalism.</p> <p>That said, within existing media organisations the central problem in achieving such an ambition remains unchanged. The power lies with the employer. While some owners are encouraging their staffs to be inventive they are, at the same time, reducing staffs to levels that stifle the possibility of innovation.</p> <p>So the dilemma for journalists who wish to build a new journalistic Jerusalem is, like everything else in this world, an economic one. They need to make a living and must necessarily make compromises to do so. Working within that reality it seems grossly unfair to blame journalists for the journalism they are required to produce.</p> <p>Yet, and this has to be taken on board, there is still much to celebrate about our current journalism in Britain, in print and on the net. For example, journalists have risen to the task of reporting on, and explaining, the current global financial crisis with considerable verve.</p> <p>I'm all for a more democratic form of journalism, a journalism of participation and a journalism based on a continuous conversation. But I also appreciate the journalism of knowledge, of a \"professional journalism\" if you like, that provides information and analysis in order to inform the public.</p>",
  "<p>As temperatures plummet, fuel bills soar and the global economic crisis eats away at everyone's bank accounts, an open fire brings comfort on all those cosy and cheap nights in.</p> <p>People are turning to the hearth for comfort in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/13/energy-ethicalliving\">increasing numbers according to the wood-burning stove suppliers, coal merchants and chimney sweeps</a>.</p> <p>Mankind's love affair with fire has lasted more than 125,000 years. Mine has obviously been shorter but rather more intense than most people's. I recently had to teach a friend how to light a fire - she's 29. But I have always made an art of lighting a fire.</p> <p>There was a childhood accident with an oak tree (it survived, by the way). There were the winters as a teenager spent trekking into the woods to keep the home fires burning when the heating packed up. </p> <p>And then there was a year of \"low impact\" living in my 20s during which I believed I stood on the moral high ground for living in a house without electricity or gas - the only heat came from an enormous inglenook fireplace and a Rayburn stove. The wood and coal we needed to keep warm and eat, ie to survive, was phenomenal.</p> <p>While burning wood and coal may sometimes cheaper than heating a home with mains gas or electricity, what about carbon emissions? <a href=\"http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/03/post_23.php\">Some argue that wood can be carbon neutral - the CO2 produced on burning can be offset by the C02 it absorbs during the lifetime of a tree.</a> </p> <p>But according to US government figures, coal is the <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/coefficients.html\">worst pollutant of them all. </a></p> <p>Coal produces 205 to 227lb of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units (BTU).

So does nuclear.</p> <p>Jim Lambeth, general manager of the <a href=\"http://www.solidfuel.co.uk\">Solid Fuel Association,</a> claims: \"The amount of emissions coming out of the chimney is infinitesimal in comparison with the millions of people burning gas.\" </p> <p>But there are also real health concerns about local pollution from particulates. I once visited an old relative in County Durham - a retired miner - who lived on an estate where you couldn't even see across the road for all the thick coal smoke.

The largest increase occurred in developing countries, where the rate rose to 79% from 68% in the preceding period. At the current pace, the world literacy rate will reach nearly 87% in 2015. <br> However, more than 75% of the millions of illiterate adults live in only 15 countries, including Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India and Nigeria. And in areas of high population growth, increased literacy rates do not necessarily indicate a decline in the absolute number of illiterate adults. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa the number of non-literate adults increased from 133 million to 163 million. In Arab states, the increase was from 55 million to 58 million. </p> <p>The literacy gender gap also remains a concern. Some 63% of illiterate adults were women in the period 1985 to 1994, compared to 64% in 2000 to 2006. <br> Unless progress is significantly accelerated, most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, south and west Asia and the Arab states will miss the UN goal of halving adult illiteracy rates by 2015.</p> <p>\"As we begin the second half of the United Nations literacy decade, the international community must seek new ways to work with marginalised populations for whom traditional approaches have proved ineffective,\" said the director general of Unesco, Ko\u00efchiro Matsuura.</p>",
  "<p>The horror stories keep coming but even so it is doubtful whether we have yet grasped the scale and seriousness of what is happening in the global economy. And, as we stand transfixed by the need to surmount the current crisis, few will lift their eyes to the longer-term implications of what is sure to be a seismic change in the way the global economy operates.</p> <p>We do not yet recognise that the imperatives that have driven governments around the world to take steps that would have been unthinkable just a couple of months ago will not lose their force just because the immediate crisis is past. The measures that are now being put in place are essential in the short term, but they also point the way to a post-meltdown future where the world will (hopefully) never be the same again.</p> <p>The last couple of weeks have seen the unwilling slaughter of sacred cows to which we have been solemnly assured for nearly three decades \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TINA\">there is no alternative</a>\": </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>Governments must be kept well away from the main levers of economic policy?</strong> No. As even George Bush agrees, government action is essential. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>Monetary policy is all that matters? </strong>No. Fiscal policy now takes its proper place in the armoury. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>Only bankers are to be entrusted with the important decisions in our economy?</strong> No. As is apparent to everyone, banks worldwide have been irresponsible, foolish and greedy and their deficiencies mean that they must in many cases be taken into public ownership. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>\"Free\" markets must be left unregulated and will always produce the best results?</strong> No. The market has failed and created a catastrophe. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>All that matters is the bottom line? </strong>No. The goals of economic activity are wider than profit for a few.</p> <p>The truth is, in other words, that if we are to survive the crisis in reasonable shape and look to a better future, we must now abandon the nostrums that have ruled our affairs and have proved so destructive. We need governments to acknowledge their responsibilities, to take a major role in first rescuing and then regulating our economy, to use a much wider range of policy instruments, and to treat markets as hugely valuable servants but dangerous masters. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/keynes_john_maynard.shtml\">John Maynard Keynes</a>, take a bow!</p> <p>We may well be living through one of those seminal moments when the tectonic plates that go to make up the most important debate in modern politics have begun to move. For as long as we have had what might be recognised as an economy \u2013 in other words, for 200 years \u2013 the pendulum of intellectual fashion has swung between two contrasting views of the proper role of government in managing the economy.</p> <p>On the one hand has been the view that governments have very limited capacity to manage the economy. Any pretension to extend that power will not only be self-defeating but also \u2013 because of the distorting effect on the proper and unfettered operation of the free market \u2013 positively damaging. Governments, according to this view, should limit themselves to those aims \u2013 such as the defence of the realm and maintaining the value of the currency \u2013 that are their proper concern. </p> <p>The other view is that government is a major player in the economy, both as an actor in its own right and as a coordinator of other actors and a maker of policy. It should accept, and perhaps seek and welcome, a responsibility for the performance of the economy \u2013 a performance to be measured not just according to monetary criteria but according to real phenomena such as output, employment and investment. The economy will perform better if the power of government is harnessed to the needs and interests of industry, and if government undertakes those functions \u2013 such as the provision of major infrastructure \u2013 that cannot easily be carried out by private industry.</p> <p>This latter view has a significant political dimension as well. If government is to do its job properly, it must use the power of democratic legitimacy to regulate and restrain the market so that society as a whole is protected against the depredations of powerful market operators. This view is on the whole (and not surprisingly) rejected by the right. But it is one of the most surprising and shameful aspects of modern political history that it has also been rejected \u2013 and enthusiastically so \u2013 by today's \"left\". New Labour has a question or two to answer.</p> <p>The lesson of this crisis is that unregulated markets certainly lead to economic disaster; but, even more importantly, they are incompatible with democracy. If markets are always right and must not be challenged, the result is not only economic meltdown but government by a handful of greedy oligarchs rather than by elected representatives. If democratic governments do not, will not or cannot exercise that power to protect their electorates, the course is then set inevitably not only for the crisis we now face but also for the abuses and failures that disfigured our economies in the years preceding the crisis.</p> <p>Shouldn't our politicians be called to account?</p>",
  "<p>Faced with the gloom of winter, expensive heating bills and global insecurity, people are returning to the comforts of the hearth with a boom in open fires and wood-burners.</p> <p>Solid fuel burners, chimney sweeps and coal merchants are all reporting a surge in business as customers try to find a cheaper way of heating their homes, and some even cite worries about energy supplies running out during a severe cold snap.</p> <p>Instinct, though, might also be playing a part. For at least 125,000 years, probably much longer, fire has cooked food and offered warmth in cold climates and scared away predators \u2014 making it very important to humans, said evolutionary psychologist Dr Lance Workman.</p> <p>\"There are so many advantages it seems likely to me that fire has played an important role in human evolution and that this is why we still find it rewarding today,\" he said. \"We don't simply 'un-evolve' such reward systems just because we live in centrally heated houses today.\"</p> <p>Fire was the only way to heat homes for millennia. But the availability of electricity and central heating has encouraged more than nine out of 10 homeowners in the UK to switch to radiators and artificial fires since the 1960s.</p> <p>The fashion for open fires was reignited several years ago, thanks to home makeover and design programmes. Interest in solid fuel burners has also been flickering to life as homeowners turned to burning fuel and pellets as an environmentally friendly alternative to gas and oil heating.</p> <p>But manufacturers and retailers say there has been a noticeable jump in sales this year. The Solid Fuel Association said members reported a 40% increase this year; the National Association of Chimney Sweeps said there had been a \"resurgence\" of demand and some businesses had waiting lists of two or three months; the president of the Coal Merchants Federation said his sales were up 20% and fellow members were enjoying similar rises; and the country's biggest chimney and flue business saw a jump of 50% in September, .</p> <p>Richard Hiblen, national manager of chimney and flue suppliers Specflue, said: \"The honest answer is as soon as British Gas put up their prices we see a big surge.\" </p> <p>The dominant issue appears to be price: figures from the Solid Fuel Technology Institute suggest burning wood alone or mixed with coal costs nearly half the price of gas or oil and one third of electricity for every \"useful\" unit of energy produced \u2014 not including supplies for free from skips and the countryside.</p> <p>Another common concern is security of supplies, especially after several winters of reports that Britain almost ran out of energy, and problems with Russian exports of gas to Europe. </p> <p>\"That's a real concern, and worry for elderly people: they are the generation who experienced 30 or 40 years of the cold war with the Russians,\" said Martin Glynn, who runs a busy chimney sweep business and is president of the National Association of Chimney Sweeps.</p> <p>There has also been growing concern about climate change, leading some homes to swap carbon-polluting fossil fuels to burning \"carbon neutral\" wood and wood pellets, which are said to absorb as much carbon in growing as they release in burning. </p> <p>The growing popularity of coal has raised some concern about the environmental downside of home fires. But the scale is currently small, says Jim Lambeth, general manager of the Solid Fuel Association. \"The amount of emissions coming out of the chimney is infinitesimal in comparison with the millions of people burning gas.\"</p> <p>And as more homes turn to fires and stoves, more \"younger\" people are realising how warm they can be, claim supporters. \"It's a real living fire: it doesn't just heat the area surrounding, it heats the fabric of the house,\" said Alan Wright, managing director of the country's second biggest coal merchant, Corralls Coal.</p> <p>But beyond the practical advantages of keeping predators at bay or making the budget meet, a big part of the appeal of a fire will be the romance or comfort of it, say supporters. </p> <p>\"We have an electric fire that has artificial flames, even without heat,\" said Workman. \"As nights draw in I find myself putting it on because it's comforting even if it's not cold, and I think other people would do likewise.\"</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Jonathan Loynes</strong>, chief European economist at Capital Economics</h2> <p>Loynes said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/record-inflation\">today's \"disappointing\" inflation numbers for September</a> were worse than expected, with the headline rate rising to 5.2% \u2014 its highest rate since March 1992. </p> <p>\"Gas and electricity price hikes explained part of the move, but the core rate rose again from 2% to 2.2%. But this will be the peak in inflation and the key issue now is just how far and fast it will drop back as the food and energy effects which have pushed it up so sharply over the last year finally fade or go into reverse,\" said Loynes.</p> <p>\"By the autumn, we expect it to have fallen to 1% but it could go lower \u2014 and even turn negative \u2014 if oil prices fall much further. So disappointing numbers today, but the inflation picture it set to change dramatically over the next year.\"</p> <h2><strong>Howard Archer</strong> at Global Insight</h2> <p>Archer said the rise was primarily due to a particularly sharp jump in utility prices, but cautioned that the Bank of England would not be pleased to see that core inflation picked up to 2.2% in September from 2% in August.</p> <p>\"While this is still relatively muted, it is nevertheless the highest level since the series started in 1997 and suggests that some retailers are still trying to pass on their higher costs,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Despite September's bigger-than-expected jump, consumer price inflation is almost certainly now at its peak, or very near to it. Indeed, consumer price inflation should soon start falling back sharply and we believe it could well be back down to its 2% target level by the end of 2009.\"</p> <h2><strong>Mervyn Kohler</strong>, special adviser for Help the Aged</h2> <p>Kohler warned that the increase in the full basic state pension for next year, based on today's new inflation rate, will be \"much too little, much too late for millions of pensioners\". </p> <p>\"It totally fails to reflect the dramatic increases pensioners are facing in food and fuel,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Research released last week showed that in reality, our oldest aand poorest pensioners face an inflation rate of around 9%, far higher than the general rate of inflation. With inflation sky-rocketing and the increase in the basic state pension not coming into effect for another six months, many older people will be forced to cut back on essential items to get through the winter.\"</p> <h2><strong>Alan Clarke</strong> at BNP Paribas</h2> <p>Clarke predicted that today's inflation is likely to represent the peak, and the trend will be steadily down from here. Base effects, lower petrol and food prices will be key drags on overall inflation, he said.</p> <p>\"What today's numbers demonstrated is that the sharp increase in costs over the last few quarters is still working through to underlying inflation. We expect this process to continue for at least another six months, before the effects of the economy slowing below potential have the opposite effect.</p> <p>\"Overall, this is unlikely to deter the MPC from cutting interest rates again next month. The MPC had expected 4.9% year-on-year on average for Q3 and what we actually got was 4.8% year-on-year. Moreover, the prospects for inflation over the medium term have diminished significantly in light of the worsening outlook for growth.\"</p> <h2><strong>Rob Carnell</strong> at ING</h2> <p>\"The breakdown of the release showed food price inflation coming down from very high levels (down to 9.3% year on year from 10.5%), but rising for energy (29.7% from 22.4%). Falling international dollar energy prices have been offset in the UK so far by exceptional sterling weakness. And rising utility bills are still having a substantial impact (up 39.2%year on year from 22.4% in August). </p> <p>\"Other than that, there seem to be few real signs of worrisome core inflation creep, and we would expect the impact of sterling on CPI to begin to wane in coming months, allowing CPI to move back down, in line with other G-7 economies inflation rates, and in line with international prices for energy and other commodities.</p> <p>\"Notwithstanding today's data, inflation will have little bearing on the Bank of England's next rate decisions. We still expect them to cut rates again, by 50 basis points over the next two meetings, taking rates to 4% by the year end, before cutting rates further to a trough of 2.75% by the second quarter of 2009.\"</p>",
  "<p>It couldn't have come as a surprise to anyone when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/stevenspielberg\">Steven Spielberg</a>'s newly liberated DreamWorks announced on Monday that Universal Pictures will distribute its slate of movies for the next seven years. Spielberg, one of the three co-founders of the company along with David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg, has enjoyed a long friendship with Universal and indeed kept his production offices on their lot during the turbulent years that followed Paramount Pictures' $1.6bn acquisition of DreamWorks in spring 2006. The familiarity is compounded by the fact that DreamWorks used to distribute its movies through Universal, Spielberg is heavily involved with Universal's theme parks and his DreamWorks CEO Stacy Snider used to be the chairman of Universal.</p> <p>It's no secret that an unhappy relationship ensued almost as soon as Paramount bought DreamWorks and the right to distribute its films. Spielberg's contract obliged him to stay in the Paramount fold until 2010 but he had an out clause if Geffen left. Geffen, who had been eager to quit the film business for some years and was entitled to leave this summer, duly obliged and cut his good friend an exit strategy to die for. Along with top CAA agent Manny Nunez, Geffen orchestrated a $1.2bn financing deal with Indian media giant Reliance Big Entertainment and a consortium of lenders corralled by JP Morgan Chase that turned DreamWorks into a cash rich, autonomous production entity. When Spielberg and Snider told Paramount about the deal, the studio surprised everyone and said the DreamWorks contingent could leave immediately. </p> <p>But who would replace Paramount as distributor of the DreamWorks slate? Universal, with a global distribution operation worthy of any in Hollywood (look how well it's done this year with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125168\">Mamma Mia!</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125451/mummy\">The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/124869/wanted\">Wanted</a>, not to mention the Jason Bourne franchise), fit the bill perfectly. Universal wasn't the only studio in the running, however. Disney and Fox had also been sniffing around, because the DreamWorks deal would guarantee up to six high-quality films a year, an invaluable addition to any studio's annual pipeline. According to one report Disney, which made the strategic decision a while ago to streamline its annual slate to about a dozen releases, was even considering ditching Miramax and replacing it with DreamWorks. The fact that Miramax, under the stewardship of the veteran British executive Daniel Battsek, is rightly regarded as one of the most prestigious labels in Hollywood shows the value studios place on luring lucrative suppliers.</p> <p>So Universal it is, then. But divorces are rarely easy and questions remain about who will assume custody of the DreamWorks-Paramount offspring. Paramount's mighty worldwide distribution network has done well by numerous DreamWorks titles, among them <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/118377/transformers\">Transformers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/116878/dreamgirls\">Dreamgirls</a> and the recent US number one movie <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126065/eagle.eye\">Eagle Eye</a>. It is still contractually obliged to distribute a number of DreamWorks movies, such as Joe Wright's upcoming drama The Soloist, which is being tipped for Oscar nominations, and next summer's Transformers 2, and would like to hold on to many more. Incidentally, Katzenberg's DreamWorks Animation, which spawned films like the Shrek series and this year's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125070/kung.fu.panda\">Kung Fu Panda</a>, is a separate company from DreamWorks and has a distribution agreement with Paramount until 2012.</p> <p>Returning to DreamWorks, the fate of dozens of active projects it hatched with Paramount hangs in the balance, among them the Tintin franchise that Spielberg and Peter Jackson are planning. After Universal turned down the opportunity to fully finance that one because it didn't like the asking price, believed to be in the region of $130m, the future of Tintin is up in the air and the uncertainty has forced the film's lead Thomas Sangster to quit the project. While DreamWorks is taking some 15 or so projects with it such as Cowboys and Aliens, Paramount has the choice to come aboard as co-financiers on any or all of them. It's also interesting to note that Spielberg can elect to direct or produce any DreamWorks project conceived during the Paramount years and stands to pocket 7.5% of the gross on those he's involved in.</p> <p>Peter Jackson's adaptation of Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones, originally set up at DreamWorks, will now be handled by Paramount. Another previously announced high-profile title, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/120866/juno\">Juno</a> director Jason Reitman's adaptation of the drama Up in the Air with George Clooney attached to star, will also stay with Paramount. We'll learn more about which films will go where in the days ahead. What's also going to be interesting to follow is how the return of DreamWorks to the Universal fold impacts Universal's other big name suppliers. Universal, which will receive an 8% distribution fee for the DreamWorks movies, already has a packed annual slate courtesy of its principal production unit, as well as established suppliers like its speciality labels Focus Features and Rogue Pictures, and deals with the comedy godfather du jour Judd Apatow, Hasbro, financing partner Relativity Media and producer Brian Grazer, whose stage adaptation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/119197\">Frost/Nixon</a> opens in December. That's a lot of elbows flying around in the Universal stable and in the fight for prime release slots some people may well end up with bloody noses.</p>",

  "<p>Today's report from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/14/greenpolitics-climatechange\">Johan Eliasch</a> on the measures needed to save the tropical rainforests demonstrates how we have reached an important watershed in a key environmental debate that has raged on for more than two decades.</p> <p>I came to this issue in 1990, when I took on the role of running <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/\">Friends of the Earth</a>'s tropical rainforest campaign. Back then the focus was on development projects such as dams and roads, the international commerce in tropical hardwoods and the land rights of indigenous people. Some famous victories were won, but the destruction was not halted. Since the early 1990s the rate of deforestation has gone up and down in intensity, but inexorably it has continued. All of the questions that were important in 1990 remain so now, only the issue has got a whole lot bigger and more important since then. </p> <p>Today <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/forests\">deforestation</a> is increasingly driven by international commodity markets in products including beef, soya and palm oil. And no longer is the concern solely about wildlife and local people. Vital though these questions remain, they are now joined by the global challenges of climate change and the supply of vital ecosystem services, including a critical role in the global freshwater cycle.</p> <p>The rainforests hold tight tens of billions of tonnes of carbon in vegetation and soils, and continue to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere even when the have reached the stage of old and mature ecosystems. As they breathe they pump out some 20bn tonnes of water into the atmosphere every day. A lot of this falls back on the forests (hence the name) but a great deal of it travels, to water crops as far away as southern Europe and North America.</p> <p>These carbon and water services are of global importance and need a global financial mechanism to pay for them. Most rainforest nations are developing countries with high levels of poverty. In order to grow, they have been liquidating forests to make way for export crops and to win natural resources, including timber and minerals. If they are going to stop this and to hang onto the forests, they will need reason to see that keeping the trees standing is a better business proposition than cutting them down. Hence the need for major international finance.</p> <p>There are of course dangers. Lots of money can sometimes do more harm than good, in fuelling corruption, widening inequalities and funding conflicts, for example. There can be inadvertent impacts on local people, who can have their interests swept aside in order that governments can gain money from global funds. And there could be reduced pressure on the industrialised countries to reduce their own emissions, if the money they provide enables them to count reduced deforestation against, for example, emissions from their own coal-fired power stations.</p> <p>Yes, we need big money, tens of billions, to pay rainforest countries to get out of the deforestation business. But it needs to be done right, in ways that improve people's welfare, uphold good governance and do not let the big global industrial polluters off the hook. It is not beyond human ingenuity to do this, but we need to now get on with it.</p> <p>The rainforest issue is now completely different. A huge opportunity exists and it must be seized. Time is running out in the race to cut greenhouse emissions and the world must now act decisively. But it must also act in ways that maximise the chances of success. That means a fair deal that is not about aid but is about compensation and a deal that recognises every country's role in the fight against climate change. </p> <p>Crucially, whatever the detail of the final deal (and hopefully one will be done at the climate change talks in <a href=\"http://www.cop15.dk/en\">Copenhagen in 2009</a>), it has to be based on improving the welfare of people. That will not be easy and will in large part rely on the continuing struggles for land rights and just development making progress in countries across the developing world. No global treaty or deal can solve all these problems at once, but a global financial mechanism could be an important part of the mix.</p>",
  "<p>Have you noticed how environmental campaigners almost inevitably say that not only is global warming happening and bad, but also that what we are seeing is even worse than expected? </p> <p>This is odd, because any reasonable understanding of how science proceeds would expect that, as we refine our knowledge, we find that things are sometimes worse and sometimes better than we expected, and that the most likely distribution would be about 50-50. Environmental campaigners, however, almost invariably see it as 100-0. </p> <p>If we are regularly being surprised in just one direction, if our models get blindsided by an ever-worsening reality, that does not bode well for our scientific approach. Indeed, one can argue that if the models constantly get something wrong, it is probably because the models are wrong. And if we cannot trust our models, we cannot know what policy action to take if we want to make a difference. </p> <p>Yet, if new facts constantly show us that the consequences of climate change are getting worse and worse, high-minded arguments about the scientific method might not carry much weight. Certainly, this seems to be the prevailing bet in the spin on global warming. It is, again, worse than we thought, and, despite our failing models, we will gamble on knowing just what to do: cut CO2 emissions dramatically. </p> <p>But it is simply not correct that climate data are systematically worse than expected; in many respects, they are spot on, or even better than expected. That we hear otherwise is an indication of the media's addiction to worst-case stories, but that makes a poor foundation for smart policies. </p> <p>The most obvious point about global warming is that the planet is heating up. It has warmed about 1C (1.8F) over the past century, and is predicted by the United Nations' climate panel (IPCC) to warm between 1.6-3.8C (2.9-6.8F) during this century, mainly owing to increased CO2. An average of all 38 available standard runs from the IPCC shows that models expect a temperature increase in this decade of about 0.2C. </p> <p>But this is not at all what we have seen. And this is true for all surface temperature measures, and even more so for both satellite measures. Temperatures in this decade have not been worse than expected; in fact, they have not even been increasing. They have actually decreased by between 0.01 and 0.1C per decade. On the most important indicator of global warming, temperature development, we ought to hear that the data are actually much better than expected.</p> <p>Likewise, and arguably much more importantly, the heat content of the world's oceans has been dropping for the past four years where we have measurements. Whereas energy in terms of temperature can disappear relatively easily from the light atmosphere, it is unclear where the heat from global warming should have gone \u2013 and certainly this is again much better than expected. </p> <p>We hear constantly about how the Arctic sea ice is disappearing faster than expected, and this is true. But most serious scientists also allow that global warming is only part of the explanation. Another part is that the so-called <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticmet/patterns/arctic_oscillation.html\">Arctic oscillation</a> of wind patterns over the Arctic Ocean is now in a state that it does not allow build-up of old ice, but immediately flushes most ice into the North Atlantic. </p> <p>More importantly, we rarely hear that the Antarctic sea ice is not only not declining, but is above average for the past year. IPCC models would expect declining sea ice in both hemispheres but, whereas the Arctic is doing worse than expected, Antarctica is doing better. </p> <p>Ironically, the Associated Press, along with many other news outlets, told us in 2007 that the \"<a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/11/america/Arctic-Melt.php\">Arctic is screaming</a>,\" and that the Northwest Passage was open \"for the first time in recorded history.\" Yet the BBC reported in 2000 that the fabled Northwest Passage was <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/918448.stm\">already without ice</a>. </p> <p>We are constantly inundated with stories of how sea levels will rise, and how one study after another finds that it will be much worse than what the IPCC predicts. But most models find results within the IPCC range of a sea-level increase of 18-59cm (7-23in) this century. This is of course why the thousands of IPCC scientists projected that range. Yet studies claiming one metre or more obviously make for better headlines. </p> <p>Since 1992, we have had satellites measuring the rise in global sea levels, and they have shown a stable increase of 3.2mm per year (1/8 of an inch) \u2013 spot on compared to the IPCC projection. Moreover, over the last two years, sea levels have not increased at all \u2013 actually, they show a slight drop. Should we not be told that this is much better than expected? </p> <p>Hurricanes were the stock image of <a href=\"http://www.climatecrisis.net/\">Al Gore's famous film</a> on climate change, and certainly the United States was battered in 2004 and 2005, leading to wild claims of ever stronger and costlier storms in the future. But in the two years since, the costs have been well below average, virtually disappearing in 2006. That is definitely better than expected. </p> <p>Gore quoted MIT hurricane researcher <a href=\"http://wind.mit.edu/~emanuel/home.html\">Kerry Emmanuel</a> to support an alleged scientific consensus that global warming is making hurricanes much more damaging. But Emmanuel has now published a new study showing that even in a dramatically warming world, hurricane frequency and intensity may not substantially rise during the next two centuries. That conclusion did not get much exposure in the media. </p> <p>Of course, not all things are less bad than we thought. But one-sided exaggeration is not the way forward.

  "<p>Markets across Asia rebounded in dramatic fashion today after global efforts to shore up ailing banks sparked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/marketturmoil-banking\">similar recoveries in US and European markets</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business+world/japan\">Japan's</a> Nikkei 225 soared by 14.2%, its biggest one-day gain in its 58-year history. The benchmark surged 1171 points to close at 9447, surpassing its previous record jump of 13.2% on October 2 1990.</p> <p>The gains, however, covered only just over half the losses the Nikkei sustained last week, when it lost almost a quarter of its value. On Friday alone it plunged 9.6%, its biggest one-day fall since the stockmarket crash of 1987.</p> <p>The broader Topix index gained 13.7% to close at 956.3 after tumbling a record 20% last week.</p> <p>With markets closed on Monday for a national holiday, today was Japan's first opportunity to gauge investor reaction to agreements by financial authorities in the US and Europe to offer massive injections of funds to free up desperately needed credit.</p> <p>\"There's relief that banks probably won't go bankrupt thanks to money injection plans, but after some rebound we will inevitably enter a phase to think about how that will actually impact the global economy,\" Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments, told Reuters.</p> <p>The Nikkei's performance mirrored an overnight surge on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average jumped more than 11% in its biggest single-day rally since 1933.</p> <p>Markets across Asia reacted positively to US government plans to plough $250bn (\u00a3145bn) into the country's top nine banks, and by a European agreement to provide \u20ac2 trillion (\u00a31.6tn) in emergency capital.</p> <p>In Japan, speculation is rife that the government is considering injecting public funds into regional banks, returning to a policy last used to drag banks out a debt crisis during the \"lost decade\" of economic stagnation.</p> <p>The government announced today it would relax restrictions on listed firms buying back their own shares and on buying stock during late trading in an attempt to support the stockmarket.</p> <p>The finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, said Japan was also ready to make significant sums available to any coordinated rescue efforts agreed by the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>The IMF, he said, \"must have a flexible and aggressive response to the crisis. And Japan is ready to contribute funds to the IMF if needed.\"</p> <p>Though Japanese banks, chastened into less risky lending practices by the bad-loan crisis of 10 years ago, have largely escaped the turmoil seen in the US and Europe, Nakagawa admitted the country's financial system was far from immune.</p> <p>\"Stocks and currencies are being traded globally 24 hours a day,\" he said. \"If something happens somewhere, Japan will be affected. Nobody knows what will happen next.\"</p> <p><strong>Mild optimism</strong></p> <p>Today, however, gave corporate Japan rare cause for mild optimism. Shares in Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ financial group, fresh from renegotiating its $9bn investment in the US investment bank Morgan Stanley, rose 14% to reach their daily upper limit of \u00a5810 (450p).</p> <p>Toyota, the world's No 2 carmaker, posted its biggest rise in 21 years. Nissan and Honda also rose sharply as exporters were buoyed by bank buyout moves in Europe and the US. Other major exporters, including Sony, breathed easier as the yen fell against the dollar for the fourth straight day.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index surged 4.5%, a day after rising just over 10%, while the main Australian index jumped 4.5%, having registered its biggest daily gain since 1997 on Monday. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks, minus Japan, continued its recovery to climb 6.6%.</p> <p>Analysts said early indications were that governments had done enough, so far, to avoid global market meltdown.</p> <p>\"It seems the tide has turned and a complete meltdown of markets and a depression have been avoided,\" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investment strategist at CFC Seymour in Hong Kong.</p> <p>\"Investors can now re-focus on fundamentals rather than the degree of panic in the market.\"</p>",
