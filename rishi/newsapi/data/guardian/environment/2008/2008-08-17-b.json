  "<p>Europe's pine forests are at risk from a killer bug that has already caused ecological catastrophes in east Asia, experts believe. Tens of thousands of trees have already died in Portugal and officials fear that pine wilt disease, which has become out of control in the south-west corner of the continent, could spread further. </p> <p>Two species of pine are susceptible: maritime pine, which makes up almost a quarter of Portugal's forests, and Scots pine, the most widespread pine species in Europe, often used for Christmas trees.</p> <p>The European commission has already imposed tight restrictions on the export of Portuguese pine, which must be disinfected and given a clean bill of health before leaving the country. But Roddie Burgess, the head of the Plant Health Service for the British government's Forestry Commission, who has been studying the disease for more than 20 years, fears the bug's spread across Portugal. \"Given the scale of the problem ... it's going to be very difficult to get on top of this,\" he said. </p> <p>The nematode bug swarms through a pine tree's innards and kills it within weeks by choking off the flow of sap. It is carried in the respiratory system of a flying beetle and was first detected in the Set\u00fabal region, south of Lisbon, in 1999, when 340,000 trees died in two years. Experts think the beetle arrived in wooden crates at a nearby port. </p> <p>The disease wiped out Japan's vast pine forests in the 1970s. </p>",
  "<p>BAA could be forced to sell Gatwick airport after the Competition Commission orders the break-up of Britain's dominant airport operator this week.</p> <p>In what would be the greatest shake-up in British airport ownership since BAA was privatised more than 20 years ago, the commission is expected to indicate that a break-up of the group is in the interests of consumers and airlines. Nine out of 10 airport passengers in south-east England travel through BAA terminals at Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted or Southampton airports, and eight out of 10 passengers in Scotland use BAA airports at Glasgow, Edinburgh or Aberdeen.</p> <p>Sir Nigel Rudd, BAA's chairman, told the BBC this weekend that he expected the commission to order divestments, amid speculation that it may demand that all three London airports end up with separate owners. The group could be forced to sell one of its airports north of the border as well.</p> <p>Rudd said a break-up would not be a \"disaster\" for the group, which has already had \"huge expressions of interest\" from potential buyers for Gatwick and Stansted. </p> <p>He argued that Heathrow competes with airports in Paris, Dubai and Amsterdam rather than ones in the UK.</p> <p>The commission is expected to argue that joint ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted results in slow development of plans to expand those airports, which in turn means passengers suffer overcrowded conditions and regular delays. </p> <p>Its conclusions in a \"provisional findings\" document, which could be published as soon as Wednesday, are therefore expected to challenge the government's 2003 aviation white paper - which prioritises new runways at Heathrow and Stansted over Gatwick. Under the commission's logic, a new Gatwick owner would work harder to overturn an agreement that prohibits constructing a second runway until 2019 and would at least start planning work sooner.</p> <p>Ryanair, Europe's largest low-budget carrier, has expressed an interest in acquiring Stansted airport if BAA is forced to sell Britain's third-biggest airport. However, the chief executive, Michael O'Leary, told the Guardian last week that the airline's priority was to see BAA reduced to owning just Heathrow and Southampton in southern England.</p> <p>\"Unless you get Stansted and Gatwick sold off, the Competition Commission will not make any difference,\" he said. </p> <p>Ryanair and easyJet, Stansted's biggest customers, are vehement opponents of airport regulation, which they claim allows BAA to charge excessive landing fees for an airport that needs only the most basic facilities to operate low-budget, short-haul flights.</p> <p>If BAA does become a forced seller of Gatwick it is expected to attract interest from a wide variety of international bidders including Germany's Hochtief, Global Infrastructure Partners, the GE-Credit Suisse Investment fund, Australia's Macquarie as well as the UK's Manchester Airport Group.</p> <p>The commission's provisional findings will be closely watched by lawyers as the watchdog usually demands that assets are sold off during takeovers or mergers not as a result of monopoly inquiries.</p>",
  "<p>Pity poor Matt Emmons, who threw away gold on his final shot for a second Olympics running. In Athens, he ended up medalless after firing at the wrong target; this time he squandered a huge lead when he pulled the trigger by accident while lining up, gifting the gold to China's Qiu Jian. Emmons ended fourth in the men's 50m rifle three-positions. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Chinese officials are thanking other foreigners for the country's sporting success. Cui Dalin, deputy head of the national delegation, praised the \"advanced training methods and new concepts\" of 38 overseas coaches for the improvement of its athletes. Earlier this year Germany's Josef Capousek accused China of working its athletes \"like horses\" in its thirst for medals after he was sacked as kayak coach.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Chinese textile manufacturers have been suffering this year, thanks to the yuan's appreciation and the global economic downturn. But one niche in the sector is bucking the trend, with flag makers benefiting from the patriotic upsurge created by the Olympics. With Chinese flags fluttering from car aerials and shops across the city, the Beijing Kaixuan flag factory is experiencing record turnover. \"I think the rate has increased by about 50 times,\" said its manager.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The \"golden girl\" of the Athens games is in disgrace after failing a drug test hours before she was to compete. The chief of Greece's Olympic Committee told Reuters that Fani Halkia, who was due to defend her 400m hurdles title, should have stayed at home instead of damaging her country's reputation. \"If you want to commit suicide it is up to you, but you do not have the right to kill your country,\" Minos Kyriakou said.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Ten sports enthusiasts have enjoyed the Olympics for free thanks to an anti-smoking philanthropist, Xinhua news agency reported. Xiong Wei placed an advert in the Beijing News offering tickets to smokers who promised to quit. After being inundated with replies he picked the applicants with the most convincing strategies for quitting. Alarmingly, the youngest winner was a 14-year-old girl.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Olympic pollution control measures have brought the best air quality for August in a decade, China Daily reported yesterday. The city had enjoyed seven \"excellent\" days, whereas last August it saw only two. But Beijing-based climatologist Wang Zifang warned: \"From Tuesday to Thursday, the wind is forecast to change direction and may bring pollutants from cities south-east of Beijing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Among the Ten Commandments of sport on TV - alongside the bit about always calling Germany \"the Germans\" - there is a rule that states a Big Olympic Voice must be used on all Big Olympic Occasions. This. Involves. Speaking in. Really short. Sentences. And also... pausing... randomly. Hunkered in the BBC gantry at the Bird's Nest Stadium for the men's 100m final, even Michael Johnson was at it - a man who usually speaks endlessly, unstoppably and entirely on one note, like the nerdy robot sidekick in a 1970s science fiction series.</p> <p>This was a huge weekend for the BBC's rolling Olympic feast, front-loaded with the moreish spectacle of the 100 metres dash. The pre-race chat on these occasions is usually a bit of a distraction. This time the BBC had lucked out spectacularly. The Usain Bolt of his era (and a sprinting great famed for his upright style, as though he alone were running a 400m Olympic egg-and-spoon race) Johnson was the perfect man to have in your ear.</p> <p>Purple-shirted and wild-eyed, he seemed edgy at first. Something was needed to puncture the tension. It came from an unexpected source. \"Did you see what he was wearing?\" Johnson shrieked suddenly as Bolt appeared mooching about in the warm-up area. \"He. Is out there... In shorts!\" he trilled again, inexplicably scandalised.</p> <p>Ah, the power of those shorts. What was it exactly? Their very looseness perhaps. Or something darker, a peculiar voodoo encoded in their faded heavy cotton. Either way, Bolt's black, rugby strip-type affairs exerted an instant catnip effect over both Johnson and his co-commentator, a sweating Colin Jackson. \"That's what's great about him, he's not going, ooh, I'm the only one out here in shorts, maybe I should put some tights on,\" Jackson burbled, seeking the key to the clarion call of these infernal shorts but instead giving an insight into the dramas in the Jackson dressing room before a big night out in Cardiff.</p> <p>Whatever it was, it worked. Pumped on leisurewear, high on shorts, Johnson was brilliantly fluent with his set and his dip and his coming out of the drive stage. \"High knee lift,\" he growled. \"Perfect use of the arms.\" Here was a man oozing sprint from his pores.</p> <p>At the starting blocks, shorts discarded for a lime-green jumpsuit, Bolt strolled about goofily, looking like a man about to return a library book. In his heat he had spent the last 50m shrugging, yawning, waving, sending emails, baking his own ciabatta rolls. In the final he had the decency to wait until the last 30 metres before breaking into jazz hands. \"It's. A. New. World. Record,\" Stuart Storey barked, as Bolt was already off indulging in... \"some tremendous celebrations...\" (ie surprisingly bad dance moves).</p> <p>Back in his treetop gantry Johnson was gabbling primitive gobbets of sprint. \"That. That was. One of the. Fastest. I predicted. Amazing,\" he explained. Sue Barker, otherwise cannily hanging back and letting her main asset sweat and babble, then forgot to press him on how he would feel about Bolt taking away his 200m record later this week. You cannot have everything.</p> <p>Elsewhere Team GB was concentrating its efforts on hoovering up further booty from the last knockings on the water. Chillingly relaxed, John Inverdale has been a compelling front-man for the BBC's rowing coverage. Inverdale has a clammy and unnerving quality. If you were producing a movie franchise about a serial killer sports anchor, you would probably tell your lead - Christian Bale or Viggo Mortensen - simply to study Inverdale.</p> <p>Over the last week Inverdale has been searching for his own Johnson-style big moment on the riverbank. Much hope had been invested in the rower Alan Campbell, he of the ruined-knee-from-tooth-abscess back-story. Before the single sculls final they got his mum on for a chat. \"It's tough being a mum on days like these,\" Inverdale mused, dreamily, fingering the hunting knife in his back pocket. Sadly Campbell was fifth. There was a long silence as the cameras hovered around the Norwegian gold medallist. \"I don't know about the candidates for Norwegian Sports Personality of the Year,\" Inverdale said, peering down the barrel of his revolver. \"But I suspect he's out in front.\"</p> <p>The real deal finally arrived with gold for Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter in the double sculls. The British pair's reward was to be hauled ashore double-quick-time for the money shot with Inverdale.</p> <p>Swaying, insensible, propped up by minions, they babbled into the mic. \"Yeah. Bit of a daze. Brilliant. Love it. Sorry,\" Hunter muttered, bent double. \"Lads. Thanks. Really,\" Inverdale called after them. Back to camera. Grin. Nailed it. In. Your. Face. Johnson.</p>",
  "<p>Few of the pioneers of the postwar pop music industry more effectively exploited the art of connoisseurship than Jerry Wexler, the American record producer and music industry executive who has died of congestive heart failure aged 91. It was his good luck that two other similarly endowed members of that small band were Ahmet and Neshui Ertegun, the Turkish brothers with whom he developed the Atlantic label into a significant creative force in the fields of rhythm and blues, soul, jazz and rock. By supervising the recordings of Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Joe Turner, Solomon Burke, Wilson Pickett, Dusty Springfield, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan and many others during a studio career lasting almost 50 years, Wexler left a discreet but indelible mark on the popular culture of the second half of the 20th century.</p> <p>It was in 1947, as a young reporter with Billboard magazine, that he coined the term \"rhythm and blues\" to replace \"race records\" as the title of the weekly charts listing the best-selling 78rpm discs among America's black population. Having given it a name that became universally accepted, he helped define the genre after switching to record production. He had loved black music from childhood, developed a strong empathy with its exponents and knew how to encourage the finest expression of their art, usually by the simple yet often overlooked expedient of setting their instincts free in a sympathetic environment.</p> <p>As influential as the individual recordings he supervised was his migration, in the mid-60s, from his New York base to a working environment below the Mason-Dixon line. First at the Stax and American studios in Memphis, then at Muscle Shoals in Alabama, and finally at Criteria in Miami, he popularised an ambience that put the emphasis on relaxation and a good groove, allowing a mixture of black and white musicians and singers to blend gospel, blues and country music with a minimum of extraneous decoration or polish. Wexler believed in an organic approach, and in his best recordings he made it sound like the only way to function.</p> <p>Location and environment became Wexler's secret: he took Pickett to Memphis, Franklin and Dylan to Muscle Shoals, Dire Straits to Nassau, and Mac Rebennack (better known as Dr John) back to his roots in New Orleans. By encouraging his artists to relax in the surroundings in which they made their records (when inspiration faded or energy flagged, he would take them fishing), he established a modus operandi that was eagerly copied by young white rock musicians. He was also meticulous in his choice of collaborators. After Ahmet Ertegun came the arranger Arif Mardin, the engineer Tom Dowd and the keyboard player Barry Beckett.</p> <p>Unlike most of their rivals in the somewhat primitive music business of the early 1950s, Wexler and the Erteguns were at ease with all levels of culture. Wexler's appetite for great literature, instilled by his mother, who hoped he would become a writer, gave him an extensive knowledge of authors from Plato, Plutarch, Shakespeare, Dante, Moli\u00e8re, Tolstoy, Turgenev and Balzac to Havelock Ellis, Theodore Dreiser, Ring Lardner and John O'Hara. Their influence was blended with Harlem vernacular in the sometimes recondite mots justes that studded his conversation and the occasional album sleeve note. Describing an early Charles recording, for example, he wrote: \"Losing Hand is a blues masterpiece, and the conversation between Ray's piano and Mickey Baker's guitar is now and always afterhours balm in excelsis.\"</p> <p>Born to a German-Jewish father who struggled to make a living from a window-cleaning business and a doting Russian-Jewish mother whose socialist inclinations led her to sell the Daily Worker on the streets of Harlem, he was brought up in the Washington Heights district of Manhattan. There he spent more of his early life in a notorious pool hall than at school. At night he would steal off with his friends to hear the big bands of Fletcher Henderson or Jimmie Lunceford at the Savoy ballroom. \"I loved the Harlem of the 30s,\" he wrote in his autobiography, \"loved its look and feel, its dance halls and nightclubs and especially its sounds.\" He was already combing junk shops for discarded 78s by Louis Armstrong, Coleman Hawkins or Fats Waller. Down in Washington DC, where their father was the Turkish ambassador, the Erteguns were doing the same.</p> <p>Eventually Elsa Wexler secured her son a place to study journalism at Kansas State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (now Kansas State University) in Manhattan, Kansas, but he lasted only two of the scheduled three years before returning home, where attempts at various careers - delivery boy, liquor store clerk, waiter - foundered until he began working for his father, \"the only employer who wouldn't turn me down\". Washing the windows of office blocks and brownstone houses was an ordeal alleviated by jazz and blues, the films of Jean Renoir and Marcel Carn\u00e9, at the Museum of Modern Art, and a meeting with Shirley Kampf, who would become the first of his three wives (the others were Renee Pappas and Jean Arnold) and the mother of his three children.</p> <p>Their wedding delayed his call-up by a year, and he worked as a customs officer. In 1942 he was drafted into the army, where he took a psychology course and gave personality tests to trainee pilots, bombardiers and navigators in the Army Air Corps. After demobilisation, he went back to Kansas in 1946 to complete his degree, and the following year secured a job at Billboard, one of the two major trade papers serving the music industry. For the next four years he deepened his knowledge and developing a range of contacts in a community that quickly recognised his energy and perception.</p> <p>A brief interlude in music publishing was followed, in 1953, by Ahmet Ertegun's invitation to become a partner in the fledgling Atlantic concern, an investment of $2,000 securing him a salary of $300 a week and a 13% stake, rising to 30% as other shareholders departed. Ertegun spent the stake money on a green Cadillac which became Wexler's company car. Immediately he was thrown into an environment where doing whatever was necessary to keep an influential disc jockey such as Alan Freed playing Atlantic's records alternated with supervising sessions that produced such classics as the Drifters' Money Honey (with a lead vocal by the superlative Clyde McPhatter), Big Joe Turner's original version of Shake, Rattle and Roll and LaVern Baker's Tweedlee Dee. Within months Wexler and Ertegun were also involved with a 23-year-old singer and pianist from Florida named Ray Charles, with whom they would lay the foundations of soul music.</p> <p>\"I realised that the best thing I could do with Ray was leave him alone,\" Wexler wrote 40 years later, although Charles's own memory of their early collaborations was somewhat different, and involved the singer responding to the producer's stream of musical suggestions with a caustic ultimatum. \"If I'm gonna do a session,\" Charles told Wexler, \"I'm gonna do it my way, or I ain't gonna do it at all.\" Wexler was shrewd enough to step back and allow Charles's extraordinary talent to express itself in a stream of hits that included It Should Have Been Me, This Little Girl of Mine, Lonely Avenue, and the two records in which Charles created the formula for the fusion of gospel and R&amp;B that became soul music: I Got a Woman and What'd I Say.</p> <p>By the time Charles left Atlantic, in 1959, the company was well established. \"I dig cross-cultural collaborations and craved success,\" Wexler wrote, \"which is maybe why Ahmet and I got on so well.\" He went on to produce Burke, another fine singer adept at bringing gospel fervour to the cadences of a blues or a country song, resulting in a string of hits that included Goodnight Baby, Everybody Needs Somebody to Love and a magnificent version of Jim Reeves's country ballad He'll Have to Go.</p> <p>It was his recordings with Pickett, including In the Midnight Hour and 634-5789, that immersed Wexler in the special musical culture of Memphis, where he negotiated Atlantic's distribution deal with the Stax label, thereby ensuring his company's participation in the profits from hits by Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Rufus and Carla Thomas, and Booker T and the MGs.</p> <p>Franklin, however, was his greatest success, even though the Muscle Shoals session that produced her first Atlantic single, I Never Loved a Man, featured a near-catastrophic row between the session musicians and Franklin's volatile husband and manager, Ted White. As soon as the record was released, however, it became apparent that Wexler, Dowd and Mardin had succeeded where other labels had failed in capturing the essence of the singer's artistry. Her hits with Wexler would include Respect, Chain of Fools, I Say a Little Prayer and many others. </p> <p>Two decades of producing classic R&amp;B and soul records had made Atlantic a legend to young British rock musicians, and towards the end of the 1960s Ahmet Ertegun was able to add the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin to the label's roster, their recordings boosting the company's profits at a time when it was being taken over by Warner-Seven Arts. Eventually Wexler and his old partner went their separate ways, Ertegun retaining his stature as the label's public face while Wexler relocated to Florida and eventually left the company altogether.</p> <p>His taste, experience and gifts as a raconteur made him a magnet for a younger generation, meaning there was no shortage of work as an independent producer, including Springfield's Dusty in Memphis (with its hit single, Son of a Preacher Man), Cher's 3614 Jackson Highway, Nelson's Phases and Stages, Etta James's Deep in the Night and The Right Time, Dire Straits' Communiqu\u00e9, Carlos Santana's Havana Moon, and the two albums with which Dylan celebrated his conversion to Christianity, Slow Train Coming and Saved. By the time he stepped down from the front line in the 1990s, just about the only significant name missing from Wexler's CV was that of Elvis Presley, whom he had narrowly failed to capture for Atlantic in 1956 and whose subsequent recordings, it is fair to say, he would have improved immeasurably.</p> <p>His survived by Jean, and his son Paul and daughter Lisa. His daughter Anita predeceased him.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Gerald \"Jerry\" Wexler, record producer and music industry executive, born January 10 1917; died August 15 2008</p>",
  "<p>The European Union has waded into the debate over expanding Heathrow airport by warning that plans for a third runway will \"significantly\" breach air pollution guidelines.</p> <p>Stavros Dimas, the European commissioner for the environment, said he will contact the British government over the issue, putting further pressure on ministers. He said an expanded Heathrow will miss EU-imposed nitrogen oxide targets after January 2015 - the latest possible date that it can meet the guidelines.</p> <p>\"We will contact the UK authorities regarding this matter,\" said Dimas in a letter seen by the Guardian. </p> <p>\"Technical reports underpinning the Heathrow expansion suggest that nitrogen limit values near Heathrow will be significantly exceeded in 2010, the year in which those limit values become mandatory, and that this will be the case even after 2015,\" he said. </p> <p>The government denies that guidelines will be breached \"significantly\" in 2015, contradicting Dimas's letter. </p> <p>According to the consultation on expanding Heathrow published last year, the introduction of \"mixed mode\", which allows continual take-off and landing on the two runways, will result in a minor breach of pollution limits in 2015.</p> <p>Mixed mode is viewed by BAA, the owner of Heathrow, as an interim measure to expand the overcrowded airport before a third runway is completed by 2020 at the earliest. Mixed-mode would increase the number of annual flights at Heathrow from 480,000 to 540,000. With a third runway, the number of flights would rise to 702,000.</p> <p>The government has pushed back its recommendation on a third runway to the end of the year as it sifts through more than 70,000 responses to the consultation. Government sources have denied reports of a \"wobble\" over expansion plans and said the recommendation over a third runway has been delayed by the sheer volume of responses to the consultation.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC is facing an uphill battle to maintain support for the licence fee, according to a new survey that shows almost half the population do not find it value for money. </p> <p>A new Ipsos Mori poll for MediaGuardian also shows that the further north you live, the less likely you are to feel that the licence fee is an appropriate way of funding the BBC. The same is true of those in lower socioeconomic groups.</p> <p>As media regulator Ofcom prepares to unveil the next phase of its wide-ranging public service broadcasting review, the results will prove troubling for BBC executives who have previously argued that the licence fee retains widespread support. </p> <p>The poll suggests that while viewers enjoy the corporation's programmes - BBC1 is by some distance the most popular channel - a large proportion do not feel the licence fee is good value for money or an appropriate way of funding the BBC. </p> <p>According to the figures, 41% agree that the licence fee is an \"appropriate\" funding mechanism and 37% disagree. But asked whether the licence fee is \"good value for money\", 47% disagree, with more than half of those disagreeing strongly. </p> <p>Nor do the majority of people believe the licence fee ensures the provision of distinctive programming not available elsewhere - long one of the key arguments for its existence. Forty-one per cent of the population disagreed, with 30% agreeing. </p> <p>The BBC Trust chairman, Sir Michael Lyons, last year commissioned research that showed viewers wanted the BBC to be more innovative. </p> <p>The devil is in the detail for the BBC, with the survey confirming it is losing the support of swaths of the population and revealing a growing north-south divide. In Scotland, 35% of people believe the licence fee is an appropriate funding mechanism but 47% disagree. In the north of England, 37% agree and 44% disagree. But in London, 41% agree and 28% disagree. </p> <p>While 56% of those classified in the higher-earning AB socioeconomic group believe the licence fee is an appropriate way of funding the BBC, that falls to 32% among those classified as DE. And while 61% of broadsheet readers agree, the figures fall to 36% among tabloid readers. </p> <p>It has long been argued by its opponents that the case for the licence fee, which costs \u00a3139.50 a year and brings in \u00a33.37bn annually, will be difficult to sustain in a fragmented digital age as the amount of time people spend consuming BBC programmes declines.</p> <p>Conversely, the BBC argues it has a more important role than ever in bringing high-quality public service content to a wide audience. Director general Mark Thompson has also sought to broaden the justification for the universal licence fee, pointing to the BBC's impact on the economy, its global reputation and its role in British cultural life.</p>",
  "<p>They are the arteries of the modern world. Stretching for tens of thousands of miles over the ocean beds, the vast web of intercontinental submarine cables have brought the possibility of cheap high-speed internet and clear long-distance telephone calls to all major parts of the globe. Except one. </p> <p>East Africa remains the only large, inhabited coastline cut off from the global fibre-optic network. Reliant entirely on expensive satellite connections, people on the world's poorest continent pay some of the highest rates for logging on or phoning. Local universities are charged up to 50 times more for bandwidth than a typical American college, making online research slow or impossible. </p> <p>\"Imagine you had all the students at Oxford trying to access the web through a single UK household connection,\" said Calestous Juma, a Kenyan professor who heads the Science, Technology and Globalisation Project at Harvard University. \"That's what it's like for most students in Africa.\"</p> <p>But with the last piece of the global fibre-optic jigsaw about to fall into place, all that is set to change. In October, the first lengths of a new 9,300-mile submarine cable to serve east Africa will be loaded on to a ship and then unrolled into the Indian Ocean. </p> <p><strong>On-ramp</strong></p> <p>The \u00a3322m Seacom cable, owned mainly by African investors, will stretch northwards from South Africa, making landfall at Mozambique, Madagascar, Tanzania and Kenya before splitting to tap into the international grid in France and India. Due to be operational by June 2009, it will be closely followed by two more finger-thin cables, including the ambitious Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System (EASSy), which will connect 21 countries on the eastern half of Africa to each other and to the world. </p> <p>\"For the first time people in the region will have an on-ramp on to the global internet highway,\" said Alan Mauldin, of TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm in the US.</p> <p>Indeed, for all the talk of a wireless era, it is physical infrastructure rather than satellite technology that enables cheap and fast communication. Intercontinental fibre-optic cables, which use light signals to transmit data, carry more than 95% of the world's internet and telephone traffic. Many of the existing undersea networks were installed in the telecoms boom of the late 1990s but a second undersea cable-laying spurt is now under way, with \u00a33.5bn-worth of new projects due for completion by 2010. </p> <p>One reason is the increased use of video download sites and peer-to-peer applications such as YouTube, which is causing global bandwidth usage to more than double every 18 months. Another is the need for backup cables in case of accidents - earlier this year businesses in the Middle East and India were badly affected for several days when a ship's anchor sliced through two undersea cables off the Egyptian coast. And finally there is demand from places never before connected to the fibre-optic grid. Even sparsely populated areas such as Greenland, which has 56,000 inhabitants, are finding that satellite links can no longer do the job. The self-governing Danish territory is laying a 3,000-mile cable that will link to the global network via Canada and Iceland. </p> <p>But it is in the eastern half of Africa where the cables are most keenly awaited. In Kenya a slow and often unreliable broadband internet connection with the main telecoms operator costs \u00a375 a month. In landlocked neighbouring countries the price can be twice as much. </p> <p>\"What's stifled demand until now is not poverty,\" said Brian Herlihy, the president of Seacom. \"It's economics - the prices are simply far too high.\"</p> <p>The International Financial Corporation, which together with 25 regional telecoms companies, is funding the \u00a3170m EASSy undersea link, estimates that its cable alone will cause internet prices to fall by two-thirds in east Africa and the number of online subscribers to triple. </p> <p>The cost of telephone calls made to other parts of the continent is also expected to drop once the new submarine and terrestrial links are in place. Many inter-African calls are now routed through Europe or the US. </p> <p>The EASSy cable should go live in early 2010, ahead of the football World Cup that year. The host nation, South Africa, is linked to the single undersea cable that runs up the west African coast to Europe but the capacity is insufficient to handle the anticipated broadcast and internet traffic generated by the games. </p> <p>Beyond the tournament, however, there are fears that there may be a large oversupply of bandwidth, especially as the Kenyan government has decided to build its own cable from Mombasa to the United Arab Emirates. But Herlihy, who points out that consumers will benefit from lower prices even if this occurs, says the new networks will unleash an \"African technological revolution\", which will quickly drive up demand.</p> <p>And it is true that many countries are banking on IT to boost their economies. Rwanda is positioning itself as a regional telecoms hub, a \"Singapore of the Great Lakes\". Kenya has a vibrant community of smart, young programmers whose skills led Google to open a development office in Nairobi last year. It also has a growing outsourcing industry. </p> <p><strong>Call centres</strong></p> <p>Despite the poor connectivity, a local start-up, Kencall, has already proved it can compete with Indian call centres for US and European clients. In two years its staff has grown from 150 to 650. But Kencall's founder, Nicholas Nesbitt, believes his workforce could reach 5,000 within three years of fibre being installed. \"For a country to be without fibre-optic links today is like being without a harbour in the past - you are landlocked,\" he said. </p> <p>Juma said the effect of cheap, fast connectivity on business in the region would be \"phenomenal\". But the biggest potential gains will be had in education, especially if schools and universities are given subsidised bandwidth. Instead of universities and students spending cash on building libraries and buying textbooks, they can access much of the same information for free online, he said. </p> <p>\"The speed that knowledge currently moves in Africa is 5mph - walking pace. But with decent connectivity knowledge will travel at the speed of light,\" declared Juma.</p>",
  "<p>The battlelines over greenwashing were drawn last week by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and its chairman, Chris Smith. The ASA upheld a high-profile complaint against Royal Dutch Shell for an ad that ran, just once, in the Financial Times in February, claiming that oil sands in Canada's wilderness were a \"sustainable\" energy source. \"We don't want to discourage companies from making legitimate claims but want to reinforce the fact that they have an obligation not to mislead,\" Smith says. \"Ambiguous or exaggerated claims risk generating scepticism and undermine the genuine initiatives that many businesses, including Shell, are taking to be greener.\" It is the second time in a year that Shell has found itself falling foul of the ASA's mounting concern, and follows an ASA ruling in December on a Shell poster showing flowers rather than smoke coming out of factory chimneys which arguably forced the pace. And it is indicative of Smith's determination to move against misleading green advertising. \"That was clearly a misleading claim. It's those sort of things we have wanted to raise concern about,\" he says. </p> <p>Chris Smith, or rather Lord Smith of Finsbury, is a genial, beaming presence - a highly unusual animal, a personable politician. Now 57, he is celebrating his first anniversary at the ASA, and applying his politician's instinct for zooming in on those issues shooting up the public agenda, while also trying to keep the ad industry, desperate to avoid more restrictions after losing the battle over junk foods and children, on side. </p> <p>His arrival at the ASA marked a change in tone from his predecessor, Lord (Gordon) Borrie, an austere competition lawyer. One of Smith's first initiatives was to hold public seminars to take soundings on fraught issues. Sparked by a sharp rise in complaints about environmental claims - which have quadrupled from 117 complaints about 83 ads in 2006, to 561 about 419 ads in 2007 - the most recent seminar focused on greenwashing, when consumers are misled about a product or company's green credentials.<br><strong><br>Confusion reigns</strong></p> <p>But while there does appear to be genuine confusion about what common terms - carbon-neutral, 100% recycled, or wholly sustainable - really mean, some see Smith as bowing to pressure groups (the flowers complaint was made by Friends of the Earth, last week's complaint was from WWF-UK). Smith denies this: \"The reason we got interested in this is that the number of complaints - from, on the whole, ordinary members of the public - about environmental claims for products and services has been going up and up. I suspect that's largely because environmental concern is rising generally, and so companies are using the environmental angle to put their case forward.\"</p> <p>The view of some critics is that the environment is not an area for advertising, which relishes superlatives. But Smith gives this short shrift: \"The raison d'etre for the ASA is that companies can make the best possible claims for their product, but not mislead people. I absolutely don't want to discourage them from doing so, the more that companies think seriously about the environmental impact of their products the better. But what they mustn't do is pretend a product is greener than it is.</p> <p>\"On quite a number of these issues there is very little official government or national guidance. It would help us enormously if things were clearer at national level.\" This is particularly true, he says, for claims of carbon offsetting.</p> <p>The advertising code is currently being revised to take green issues into account, as well as going through a broader overhaul - the ASA, as a non-governmental body, oversees binding codes of practice for self-regulation of the advertising industry, most recently assuming operational responsibility for broadcasting.</p> <p>\"The green claims points can be included in that revision,\" Smith says. \"But it won't stop there, it will have to be continually looked at, because this is a fast moving area.\"</p> <p>But greenwashing is only one of the issues the ASA is taking on: Smith also highlights a serious problem with the internet, which, with 2,980 complaints last year is now the second most complained about medium, after television, and ahead of print - and yet the ASA currently only has limited jurisdiction over pop-up ads and paid-for search devices. The authority calculates that more than 70% of complaints are entirely outside its remit, and has asked the Advertising Association, the industry's overall trade body, to take an urgent look. It is expected to report in September. </p> <p>\"These [complaints] are coming from shoppers, ordinary people. The complaints are virtually all about misleading and inaccurate ads, not taste and decency issues. This is bread and butter stuff for the ASA,\" says Smith. \"What we don't have is any agreement for advertising on companies' own websites, if it's a direct email to you from a company, say with an offer, it is covered, but if you click into a company website, that's not covered.\"</p> <p>Smith adds that this large grey area includes child-friendly games, characters, and stories, advertorials, and the marketing of products, deals and prices. \"On the whole nowadays a company which has a marketing department has executives who know the rules. In most cases they are using advertising agencies who know the codes. But the website may be being done by someone else. Getting the people who draw up website content to think about codes may be the way forward. The world of advertising needs to recognise there is an issue and needs to address it.\" </p> <p>The ASA is ready to help, but Smith says it is \"not up to us to decide what happens\". He suggests one possible solution: an agreement to include advertising material on websites within the scope of the codes. \"If that is the case there will have to be some sort of adjudication process on complaints. It would be a major expansion of work, and we would need income to resource that.\" </p> <p>Smith is far more relaxed about the operation of the ban on ads for high fat, salt and sugar foods in programmes children watch. \"There are a few campaigning groups who are arguing that the rules are not strict enough, and there are calls for pre-9pm bans [on all advertisements for these foods, regardless of the programme],\" he says. \"My own personal view is that would be an overreaction.\"</p> <p><strong>Resigning the whip </strong></p> <p>Towards the end of our interview, Smith suddenly confesses to feeling \"a bit odd\". Just days before we met, this career politician had resigned the Labour whip, and become a non-aligned peer after taking on the chairmanship of the Environment Agency, a government body. Having spent a major part of his working life in active politics, declaring himself as a neutral requires a mental shift and a step back from direct involvement.</p> <p>Given that he is no longer a Labour peer, I ask what he has made of the youthful Andy Burnham's performance so far, as culture secretary - Burnham served as a special adviser to Smith when he was in government. The culture secretary has rushed to pre-empt a consultation period on the possible introduction of product placement on television, by declaring his opposition. What does Smith make of this? \"My view currently is let's see what the consultation provides on this. I'd say that in five years' time the way people watch TV may have changed dramatically, and the impact of specific advertising slots may have reduced to such an extent it becomes difficult to finance programmes. It might [have to be] through product placement. Simply ruling it out ... I'm not sure. I'm not wanting to take a definitive view at this stage.\"</p> <p>When Smith was culture secretary, of course, he helped create Ofcom, which is currently seeking a new chairman. Smith says he thinks Ofcom has been a \"considerable success\" on the whole, when asked for his assessment. \"Nine out of 10. It's easy to underestimate the scale of the task it faced ... there are moments when they need to pay slightly more attention to the content side of their work than the purely economic and competition side, but that's a minor quibble.\" </p> <p>As for Ofcom's current public service broadcasting review, Smith has been persuaded by Channel 4's argument for public funding. \"I'm convinced by the case Channel 4 is making for their need for assistance in some years' time: they don't need it now. I believe they are a very important part of the broadcasting landscape. We must look seriously at where that help could come from.</p> <p>\"Top-slicing is not an option I would rule out completely. If I was secretary of state and I had \u00a3100m of licence fee money to deploy, with public service broadcasting values in mind, would I spend it on BBC3, or would I spend it on helping Channel 4? I think that's a very difficult question for the BBC to answer.\" And for Smith? It would, he says, have to be spent on Channel 4 because it is \"absolutely\" more important than BBC3.</p> <p><strong>Curriculum Vitae </strong><br><strong>Age</strong> 57<br><strong>Education</strong> Pembroke College, Cambridge and Harvard<br><strong>Career</strong><br><strong>1983 </strong>elected Labour MP Islington South and Finsbury<br><strong>1997-2001 </strong>secretary of state for culture, media and sport<br><strong>2003-2008 </strong>chairman, Clore Leadership Programme<br><strong>2005</strong> becomes life peer, privy councillor<br><strong>2007</strong> chairman, Advertising Standards Authority<br><strong>2008</strong> chairman, Environmental Agency</p>",
  "<p>By our standards, a torrent of gold - more than the Germans, Australians and Russians. Subdue, for a second, that inevitable British response: \"It can't last.\" Maybe not, but a small dance of pleasure is called for. The girls and the boys done good. But after the dance, let's pause to ask what any of it means.</p> <p>For there will be plenty who'll say that these were mostly not \"real sports\" and so not \"real medals\". Still more will reflect on the awesome organisation and impeccable glitz of Beijing, and worry whether in 2012 we can match that in London. Can Britain any longer produce a games which is not some kind of national humiliation of soaring costs, political infighting, transport mayhem and security mania?</p> <p>If a lot of our medals come from cycling and water sports, well that just reflects the country. You can barely move for lycra-clad loons. By the sea this week I watched amazing kitesurfing and windsurfing acrobatics. If the Britain that won medals in dressage is being replaced by a Britain winning them for canoeing and sprint cycling, that is, on balance, rather cheering.</p> <p>It's easy to mock the Olympics. There is grandiose over-claiming by commentators who pretend that every tenth of a second improvement on the track, or unexpected wobble of a bicycle wheel, is a deathless triumph of the human spirit, or tragic moment worthy of Shakespeare. At times you have to laugh.</p> <p>But you have to be astonished too. For alongside the pomposity and hype, this is still an event where people from all backgrounds - Kenyan highlands to Californian colleges, Russian industrial towns to Chinese farms - achieve a dream that will glow around them and their families, for the rest of their lives. In a world mostly organised for war and business, it is a rare global celebration of peaceful, personal striving and talent.</p> <p>It is absolutely true that there is nothing fair about Olympic-level sport. The top competitors are single-minded, driven people who have often been given the best training, nutrition and coddling money can buy. A few are physically blessed, with abnormal skeletons and musculature that give them a huge advantage. It's simply sentimental nonsense to say that anyone who worked hard enough could take on Michael Phelps in the pool, or Usain Bolt on the track.</p> <p>But almost all prizes are \"unfair\". Nobel peace prizes aren't available to most people either. Not every kid can win the sack race. I couldn't write a Booker-winning novel however long I sat at the keyboard. But prizes and competition raise our sights.</p> <p>Scientists dream of recognition and work longer hours because of them; authors try harder; companies compete for pieces of plastic with engraved names, handed out at drunken award dinners. All this is human nature, and part of how we try to do better.</p> <p>The Olympics are just the same. They provoke children, and adults, into running, swimming, cycling, jumping and rowing. They give the ordinary heroes, and draw us a little way after them. They remind us what hard work, dedication and skill can do. They provide stories about heartache and bravery - Paula Radcliffe - and giving something back - Kelly Holmes. And by doing that, they change millions of people's lives far away from grand stadiums.</p> <p>Take, for instance, the ludicrous and offensive suggestion that overweight children should be taken into care because obesity is a form of \"child abuse\". (If it is, then removing children from their parents is a worse one.) The real way to fight child obesity is through food education, yes, but also sport.</p> <p>Looking around at all the lean kids in coloured shirts, even I can see that Manchester United or Liverpool do more to stop British boys being too fat than any government programme.</p> <p>What the glamour of football does for millions of boys needs to be matched for other boys, and for girls. Decent swimming pool provision, more sports fields for schools and national coaching schemes are the minimum follow-up which keep the Olympics alive when the games have stopped. If you want children from working-class backgrounds to be given better opportunities, sport - with its glamour, its prizes, its characters - is a vital part of the story.</p> <p>So, what finally of our \"uh-oh\" reaction to the challenge of London 2012? The mild chaos at Athens, never mind the terrorist attack at Munich and the various boycotts over the decades, give just a hint of what can go wrong. With so much concrete still to be poured, so much money involved, and the increasingly dangerous politics of this youthful century, the London organisers have plenty to worry about.</p> <p>They will have to do their best at a time when we are dangerously close to believing that in Britain, nothing works, and nothing ever will. We can't set up and run computer systems for the NHS, nor build large public works on time or to budget. We can't move around our main cities in reasonable order nor educate most of our children properly. And we have the gall to think we can run the Olympics? Sotto voce, in a million kitchens, the mutter begins: \"Remember the Dome.\" (And after all, the London Olympics are the legacy of Tony Blair, the man whose irrepressible optimism took such a fall on Millennium night.)</p> <p>So now do we secretly believe it would have been better for us had Paris won? Bringing the Olympics here will be a huge challenge. We have become almost self-hating as a country, mentally prepared to fail, too quick to sneer. Yes, the 2012 games need better public administration, and a stronger sense of public good, as against private self-enrichment. But there are plenty of people out there who will lend a hand, and officials will work fiendishly hard, if only out of a rising sense of terror at the consequences of failure.</p> <p>Things will go wrong. They always do. We won't have the military precision of the Chinese because, thank God, we are a disputatious democracy. If we have a singer with a golden voice and a plain face, she'll sing. Our protestors and our derelicts will be in plain view. Our mass choreography will be, I expect, hilariously dodgy.</p> <p>But we can run a reasonably efficient, welcoming, good-humoured games if we choose to. We did it in the immeasurably bleaker, harder year of 1948. If we do this, it will light up the lives of tens of millions of British people, who will grow up just a little fitter, stronger, more fulfilled and happier as a result. And if that's not a reasonable political aspiration, I don't know what is.<br><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\"><br>jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Madeleine Bunting (We may admire the Nordic way, but don't try to import it, August 15) may be correct in asserting that Nordic societies are more orderly than ours, but is that such a bad thing? Is being expected to behave according to reasonable social norms so terrible, especially if, as she suggests, the package may include less inequality, better welfare provision etc? </p> <p>And just what is wrong with a \"remarkable degree of mutual trust and expectation that characterises Scandinavian social relations\"? It's hard to see present-day Nordic society as being \"stiflingly oppressive\". Finland, for example, like Britain, has changed dramatically over the past 40 or 50 years, but still retains some of the social cohesion that we used to enjoy. We can still learn from the Nordic model.<br><strong>David Moss</strong><br>Rochdale, Lancashire </p> <p>Madeleine Bunting's observations on Scandinavian societies are superficial and in some cases inaccurate. Their brand of Protestantism comes via Germany and is Lutheran not Calvinist. That is perhaps why music and, especially choirs, play such an important role in social bonding and culture. Finland, in particular - with a population below that of London - has an extraordinary high profile in the music world. </p> <p>Finland has the lowest proportion of its population in prison and the highest in higher education of any country in the world. Furthermore, the penal system of all Scandinavian countries is aimed at rehabilitation (in which they are very successful, unlike our own). This is the sort of tolerance we could learn from. Meanwhile, Sweden, with an acceptance rate of asylum-seekers per head of the native population way in excess of ours, has very little racism.</p> <p>Perhaps we could benefit from more \"egalitarian conformity\" and maybe the inhibition we feel in expressing disapproval of inconsiderate behaviour has more to do with fear of assault than of any genuine tolerance.<br><strong>Kate Macintosh </strong><br>Winchester, Hampshire</p> <p>The slim evidence Madeleine Bunting offers for the \"stiflingly oppressive\" tendencies of the Nordic social settlement includes the fact that credit cards were not allowed in Sweden until the 1990s. So unlimited consumer credit is something the British can be proud of, is it? </p> <p>And how can the Finns be criticised for not imposing their private conversations on everyone else in a restaurant by shouting at each other? The \"ingrained self-restraint\" of such societies may be \"profoundly foreign\" to some, but not to us all. What's more, unless all developed nations abandon consumerism for just such self-restraint, the planet's climate is going to collapse. What Bunting calls \"consensual authoritarianism\" is surely our only way to avert that disaster.<br><strong>Bob Irvine </strong><br>Edinburgh</p> <p>Madeleine Bunting criticises Scandinavian \"egalitarian conformity\" and \"consensual authoritarianism\". Her view that personal freedoms are preferable to collective considerations will no doubt be widely shared. </p> <p>But however valid this view may have been in the past, it will no longer suffice in the dawning era of one world. Today all human beings face the same global problems of inequality, climate change and resource constraints (to mention just a few). These can only be tackled effectively by putting the collective interest before that of individuals. However restrictive the Nordic view may appear, it points the way ahead for all of us, irrespective of party politics.<br><strong>Eric Deakins </strong><br>London</p> <p>Madeleine Bunting is right to draw attention to the downside of oppressive forms of conformity which can occur in some Nordic societies and elsewhere.</p> <p>However, if we could make a concerted effort to import Nordic norms of courtesy in public spaces, their egalitarian ethos and their willingness to fund high-quality publicly funded universal welfare services for all, then British society would be improved immeasurably. Let us make a start as soon as possible.<br><strong>Robert Page</strong><br>Birmingham</p>",
  "<p>Listening to Mervyn King studiously avoid using the R word last week, it was tempting to imagine what Jim Cramer would have made of Britain's descent into recession.</p> <p>Cramer is the excitable pundit on the US cable business channel CNBC and last August he delivered a rant against the Federal Reserve for its failure to cut interest rates. The Fed, Cramer shouted at his bemused co-presenter, was asleep. Ben Bernanke, its chairman, was being \"an academic\", a term not meant as a compliment. Americans were losing their homes and their jobs while the central bank did nothing. \"The Fed has no idea how bad it is out there,\" Cramer hollered. \"Nuts, they're nuts!\" </p> <p>The Bank of England knows how bad it is out there. The nine members of the monetary policy committee traverse the country on regional visits that are meant to ensure that bank-rate decisions are not taken from an ivory tower in Threadneedle Street. It is true, though, that the MPC is stuffed full of academics. And, sad to say, it is even more true that the Bank has been asleep. </p> <p>Evidence for this comes from the Bank's own Inflation Report, which contains projections for growth and inflation. These are presented in fan charts, with the dark colours in the centre representing the Bank's best guess as to the likeliest path of output and inflation. The fan is supposed to cover 90% of probabilities, with the pale hues on the edges of the fan considered highly unlikely to materialise.</p> <p><strong>Mug's game</strong></p> <p>Last week, the Bank said it expected inflation to peak at 5% later this year and growth to come to a standstill over the coming 12 months. King said there was bound to be the possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth. Yet the August 2007 Inflation Report shows that the prospect of 5% inflation or negative growth were off the scale. It is fair to say that in August 2007 the economy was growing at an annual rate of 3% plus and inflation was 1.8%. It is also fair to say that the credit crunch had yet to erupt and the oil price was $70 a barrel. Having said that, the Bank has still got it wildly wrong and - given the volatile times we are living in - is quite likely to continue to get it wrong.</p> <p>To its credit, the Bank admits that making spot forecasts is really a mug's game, so the latest Inflation Report suggests that the risks are that inflation will be even higher than it expects and growth lower. The Bank's job is to weigh up these risks when it sets interest rates, and it is the fact that the outlook for growth has worsened even as inflation has picked up that has resulted in bank rate being left at 5% since April.</p> <p>Yet this approach suggests that the risks to the economy are symmetrical when they are not. The prospect of growth being weaker than the Bank expects is more likely than a further spike in inflation.</p> <p>Taking the output side of the equation first, almost every piece of economic news recently has been worse than expected. Business surveys have weakened, consumer confidence has collapsed, housing market activity has dried up, manufacturing output has fallen and - perhaps most significant - unemployment has started to pick up. There has been a deterioration in the claimant count and the labour force survey measures of unemployment; what's more the trend is accelerating and has echoes of the early stages of the savage shake-outs in the labour market in the 1980s and 1990s. There is the potential for some shocking figures over the next couple of months when school leavers show up in the unemployment data. </p> <p>The domestic slowdown is being mirrored abroad, where the eurozone's first ever quarter of negative growth shows how quickly conditions have worsened and how difficult it is going to be for the UK to export its way out of trouble. </p> <p>Finally, it is clear that the credit crunch is having a profound impact on the supply and cost of credit. When the Bank was raising rates in 2006 and 2007, the full impact of the monetary policy tightening was softened by competition among lenders to offer attractive deals to borrowers. Since last August, lenders have been vying to see who can offer the worst terms, blunting the impact of the three quarter-point cuts in bank rate.</p> <p>Turning to inflation, evidence suggests that the commodity bubble has burst - as would be expected given the outlook for the global economy: recession in the US, looming recession in Europe, slower growth in China as attempts are made (once the Olympics are over) to rein in inflation. Significantly, even the prospect of a new Cold War as a result of Russia's invasion of Georgia had little impact on the cost of crude. When we look back, July 2008 will be seen as the peak for commodity prices and September 2008 will be the peak for UK inflation.</p> <p><strong>This year's pay rise</strong></p> <p>Why the confident prediction? </p> <p>This is 2008 and not 1978, and though wage negotiators would love to get compensation for higher inflation through higher wages there is scant evidence that they are capable of doing so. With the economy slowing fast and unemployment a reality, for many workers holding on to their jobs will be this year's pay rise. Higher unemployment and the squeeze on real incomes means depressed consumer spending, which in turn means that companies are going to have to take cost increases on the chin.</p> <p>There are counter arguments, of course. One is that inflation may be at or near a tipping point where the shock from higher commodity prices can no longer be absorbed. Another is that there will be a run on the pound if the Bank \"goes soft\" on inflation. A third is that cutting rates would set off another cycle of binge borrowing, over-consumption and rising house prices. Finally, the Bank's mandate is to hit the 2% inflation target even if that means recession. But average earnings are heading down, the pound is falling because the markets fear a stonking recession, and the evidence from the US is that cutting rates puts a floor under the economy but it doesn't re-inflate a collapsing property bubble.</p> <p>The MPC must accept at least part of this argument, otherwise it would have raised rates vigorously as inflation moved well above target. But my hunch is that it will delay action for a few months, awaiting reassurance that there are no \"second-round\" effects from the commodity shock. By then, it will be too late to spare the economy from a severe recession. Having failed to lean against the wind when the housing market was red hot back in mid-decade, the Bank is repeating the mistake by keeping policy too tight. It will be so far behind the curve next year that it will be forced into deep cuts in interest rates to stem the tide of repossessions, business failures and unemployment - and to prevent inflation falling well below its target.<br><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\"><br>larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Labour today fires the opening salvo in an autumn offensive against the Tories with a warning that \"Cameronomics\" is designed to hide a \"risky and destructive\" approach to the economy behind pretty photo opportunities. </p> <p>In a highly personal attack, the Treasury chief secretary, <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/person/0,,-1109,00.html\">Yvette Cooper</a>, declares that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> is distracting the attention of voters while sneaking through the \"traditional Tory red meat\" of tax cuts.</p> <p>\"The Conservative leader hopes to distract us with frisbees, floral shorts, and photo-ops,\" Cooper writes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/18/davidcameron.conservatives\">today's Guardian</a>. \"But a serious look at his policies reveals an approach which is at best confused and at worst would be deeply damaging for our economy.</p> <p>\"Cameronomics is emerging, in which photo ops, warm words and conflicting promises attempt to distract from a risky and destructive ideological agenda.\"</p> <p>The article by one of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a>'s closest allies in the cabinet makes clear that Downing Street will be intensifying its personal attacks on the Tory leader as part of an autumn offensive.</p> <p>Brown, who returns to the fray this week with a high-profile visit to Beijing for the closing ceremony of the Olympic games, hopes to revive his premiership by outlining a two-point plan on the economy. This will entail help for the less well-off, who are struggling in the face of the global economic downturn, and a warning that the Tories would be dangerous for the economy.</p> <p>Cooper will take the lead in Labour's attack on the Tories in a speech which she previews in today's Guardian article. Her intervention comes ahead of the Tories' \"economy week\", in which George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, will attempt to portray the Tories as the party of fairness.</p> <p>Cooper challenges this today by outlining three main charges against Cameron. He stands accused of:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Ducking \"difficult questions\" such as Northern Rock, or the future of nuclear power. She writes: \"He has tried to confine policies to vague populist promises, from tax cuts to more prisons, to solving family breakdown, without getting drawn on delivery. But dig deeper and what you see is not quite what you get. Promises made to different audiences don't stack up. He campaigns against a new runway for Heathrow in the London mayoral election, whilst promising the City to do more on infrastructure.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Adopting an inconsistent approach on fiscal policy with what Labour claims are \u00a311bn of unfunded spending promises.</p> <p>\"Cameron is promising lower taxes, more spending and lower borrowing, all at the same time,\" writes Cooper. \"He pledges billions in tax cuts on marriage, inheritance tax and stamp duty. Savings to pay for proposals frequently prove illusory. Faced with calls to make the sums stack up, Cameron reverts to slogans - 'sharing the proceeds of growth,' or 'living within our means'. When pressed, he concedes this means sticking with Labour's spending plans.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Pursuing a \"deliberate strategy\" to distract voters from the Tories' real agenda of tax cuts. \"Cameron knows that his party are keen for some traditional Tory red meat, especially on tax cuts. Their policy positions also reveal ideological stances which would be bad for the British economy,\" Cooper writes.</p> <p>\"They remain hostile to government action ... at a time when the role of government is critical to stability and prosperity. They are opposed on principle to government involvement in redistribution, even when those on lowest income are facing the greatest squeeze.\"</p> <p>The article by Cooper shows that members of Brown's circle have thought long and hard about how to attack Cameron. The Brownites have faced criticism that they have failed to develop a coherent attack on the Tory leader which goes beyond the prime minister's traditional charge that the Tories simply want to cut spending to pave the way for tax cuts.</p> <p>Blairites have said that the Brown camp needs to follow the example of James Purnell, the work and pensions secretary, who launched a widely praised attack on Cameron in June in which he accused the Tory leader of \"confusion and emptiness\".</p>",
  "<p>If you are struggling to cope with the havoc wreaked in your flowerbeds by recent extreme wind and rain, you're not alone. The Royal Horticultural Society has diagnosed a new national affliction: plant bereavement. </p> <p>About half of all callers to their plant advisory service are dealing with the trauma induced by wilted, leafless or damaged plants. Luckily, the team from the RHS are able to deal not only with horticultural questions, but also emotional ones. Many gardeners, they say, feel personally connected to their plants, particularly when they have been nurtured for many years, or given by someone special. </p> <p>\"Gardeners often go through the same stages of grief - shock, denial, anger, depression and acceptance,\" says Leigh Hunt, the principal horticultural adviser at the RHS's Wisley garden. These feelings are often laced with guilt, for having failed to treat the beloved plants correctly. Moreover, problems in British flowerbeds have increased in recent years because of erratic weather conditions (the hottest summer on record in 2006 and the wettest in 2007) as well as new pests (lily beetle, horse chestnut leaf-mining moth and rosemary beetle - the latter is thought to be an indicator of climate change).</p> <p>Although not much can be done when a plant is infected by a contagious disease, the RHS team will counsel its members to overcome the grief. In certain extreme cases of denial, Hunt has had to send samples for DNA testing in order to convince the mourning gardeners that the plant is indeed dying. For Hunt the most important stage in the grief cycle is \"acceptance\". He consoles callers by reassuring them that they are not alone in their honey fungus affliction, for example: \"they are in good company - Kew Gardens has it, as have we at Wisley\". Hunt will then suggest the caller tries to replace their beloved plant, perhaps with a more resistant species: \"something new, something exciting\" (a bit like setting up a newly single friend on a blind date). </p> <p>But is this enough? With new pests spreading and more extreme weather conditions predicted, maybe the RHS should consider branching out. Regional plant bereavement groups, perhaps, where affected gardeners can share their pain.</p>",
  "<p>One of the world's classic mountain trekking routes is at risk of obliteration from plans to bring golf and skiing package tourism to the Himalayas. </p> <p>Tourism chiefs in Nepal are keen to replace the stereotypical \"trekker on a shoestring\" with credit-card tourists seeking adventure holidays, including activities such as heli-skiing and paragliding. </p> <p>The development will mean that the Annapurna circuit, which opened to backpackers in 1977, will be overwhelmed by a new road running through the heart of the Himalayas. Buses, taxis, motorbikes and tractors will ply the route connecting the mountain resort of Manang - currently reachable by footpath or air - to Nepal's national transport network.</p> <p>Wildlife and plants will be destroyed and scores of porters and guides could lose their livelihoods, officials concede. </p> <p>Aditya Baral, Nepal's senior foreign affairs adviser, said: \"After the construction of the road ... the number of trekkers will be reduced. We have a trade-off here between economic development and infrastructure and the effect on tourism and the environment. We need to create alternative attractions to just trekking.\" </p> <p>Baral, a former public relations director at the Nepal tourism board, added that Nepal wanted to attract different types of tourism. \"We are trying to create man-made tourism attractions, like theme parks, adrenaline sports like bungee jumping and rafting.\"</p> <p>At present, trekkers to the Annapurna region, in central Nepal, typically spend five days walking to Manang at 3,500 metres before continuing on for another two weeks to the resort of Pokhara. But the road is already being built along part of the route to Manang and eventually will follow much of the mountain trek.</p> <p>Supporters say the plans are essential for the survival of Himalayan villages and for tourism in the area. But conservationists and trekkers have reacted angrily. The Annapurna Conservation Area Project group fears that tour operators will go to any lengths to increase profit from tourism. In a report, it said benefits from activities such as heli-skiing and golf \"will mainly go to a few specialised tour operators and some more expensive hotels. </p> <p>\"Although there will be some trickle down [of profits], for the majority of the local people these activities will have little effect on alleviating poverty,\" it said.</p> <p>Emmanuel Deghary, 29, from Marseille, who has made the trek four times, said of the new road: \"There will be buses and tractors and lorries churning out their choking fumes all day and all night. Is this the way we want to treat our planet?\"</p>",
  "<p>'It's the economy, stupid.\" That 1992 Clinton election campaign slogan still resonates and will define the general election debate whenever it comes. Our economy faces a difficult time and families are worried about rising bills and job prospects. Labour's economic policy is rightly under scrutiny in response to world economic pressures. The prime minister and chancellor have said we must do more to help families and businesses, building on the financial stability measures and \u00a34bn tax cuts this year, and we will.</p> <p>But who is asking questions about the Conservatives? Their leader hopes to distract us with frisbees and photo ops. But a serious look at his policies reveals an approach that would be deeply damaging for our economy. Over the next few months, we in the Labour party must expose the risks and contradictions at the heart of Cameronomics.</p> <p>Wherever possible, David Cameron has ducked difficult questions - be it on global commodity prices, the collapse of Northern Rock, the 10p tax rate, or the future of nuclear power. He has tried to confine policies to vague populist promises, from tax cuts to more prisons, to solving family breakdown.</p> <p>But dig deeper, and what you see is not quite what you get. He campaigns against a new runway for Heathrow in London's mayoral election, while promising the City to do more on infrastructure. He promises green tax increases to the green movement, and tells everyone else they won't make anyone worse off.</p> <p>The greatest inconsistencies are in fiscal policy, where Cameron is promising lower taxes, more spending and lower borrowing all at the same time. He pledges billions in tax cuts on marriage, inheritance tax and stamp duty. Savings to pay for proposals often prove illusory. The spending promises continue too - a bigger army, more prison places, and more for the NHS.</p> <p>Faced with calls to make the sums stack up, Cameron reverts to slogans - \"sharing the proceeds of growth\", or \"living within our means\". When pressed, he concedes this means sticking with Labour's spending plans.</p> <p>By my tally, the Tories have commitments of an extra \u00a311bn of unfunded promises, while saying borrowing is too high. This inconsistent approach to fiscal policy would be extremely bad for the economy - creating additional risks and instability at a difficult time.</p> <p>The generous interpretation of these contradictions is that Cameron is confused. I don't think he's confused, I think this is a deliberate strategy to distract. He knows that his party - and in particular his shadow chancellor - are keen for some traditional Tory red meat, especially on tax cuts. So they remain ideologically opposed to Europe at a time when world economic problems mean European and international co-operation matter more than ever. </p> <p>They remain hostile to government action - for example opposing nationalisation of Northern Rock even at the risk of serious financial instability - at a time when the role of government is critical to stability and prosperity. And as Cameron admitted recently, they are opposed in principle to government involvement in redistribution, even when those on lowest incomes face the greatest squeeze from world pressures.</p> <p>However, after his own experience of Black Wednesday, Cameron knows the damage to his party from inept and unpopular economic policies. Hence the emergence of Cameronomics, where photo ops and warm words attempt to distract from risky, destructive ideology.</p> <p>The challenges facing the world economy are, in the words of the IMF, the most serious since the great depression. Cameron would prefer to duck the serious issues. For the sake of long-term economic prosperity, Labour must ensure he doesn't get away with it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Yvette Cooper is chief secretary to the Treasury <a href=\"mailto:coopery@parliament.uk\">coopery@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The Moors murderer Ian Brady has complained about low wages and poor treatment at the top-security hospital where he is held, in a wide-ranging letter in which he also claims that people do not feel safe walking the streets.</p> <p>In the eight-page handwritten letter to his MP, George Howarth, and his solicitor, Brady criticises the government for undermining civil liberties by playing on people's security fears.</p> <p>The killer, now 70, is held in Ashworth hospital, Merseyside, where he claims he is getting a \u00a325-a-week allowance while others at the hospital get \u00a3100. As a \"prison transfer\", Brady is entitled to \u00a31,300 of taxpayers' cash a year - less than the amount for full-time patients.</p> <p>He has been on hunger strike since 2001 and is being kept alive by force-feeding. He has said he wants to return to an ordinary prison where he says he would be free to starve himself to death.</p> <p>In his letter, Brady rails against the regime at Ashworth. \"Perhaps more embarrassing to prudently financial New Labour are the ranks of tramps and malingerers who have escaped into Ashworth to avoid working for a living, demanding and receiving full board and full benefits of \u00a3100 per week pocket money for life (we prison transfers receive only \u00a325, being regarded as 'patients' only for restrictions),\" he writes.</p> <p>While boasting that he is \"in the top 5% of the UK population\" for intelligence, he says: \"Cataracts I've had for 10 years are untreated, as my visiting an outside hospital would again draw unwanted attention.</p> <p>\"Quality background: Haven't exercised in the open air since 1975; stopped all social visits since 1998 when Ashworth became less than a prison; confined to ward for past 23 years; force-fed since 1999. I - a 70-year-old tube-fed skeleton - am the sole high-profile prisoner Ashworth holds to exploit as a demonising agent.\"</p> <p>The letter goes on: \"In like fashion New Labour exploits the threat of a few fertiliser bombs to panic and heard a bovine generation. As a child I watched German planes daily/nightly bomb Glasgow back to full employment; New Labour has accomplished more permanent diminution of human/civil liberties than WW2 bombs and rockets ever achieved. </p> <p>\"New Labour's disregard for human/civil rights is now a general contagion, with each infliction coated in a syrup of entirely cosmetic 'safeguards' for swallowing.\"</p> <p>He criticises the \"surveillance society\" that he says \"rightly has people complaining they can't safely walk the streets\".</p> <p>Brady instructed Liverpool-based RMNJ, mental health specialist lawyers, to appeal to a mental health review tribunal to allow him to be transferred to a conventional jail.</p> <p>His solicitor, Richard Nicholas, of RMNJ, said, \"The change in the therapeutic environment at Ashworth since the late 1990s has led Mr Brady to wish to be transferred back to prison. He wishes to be free from the power of psychiatrists under the Mental Health Act, including the power to artificially prolong his life by force feeding.\" </p> <p>Brady was jailed for life alongside his former lover Myra Hindley in 1966 for murdering three children. He later confessed to killing two more.</p> <p>The victims were buried on Saddleworth Moor, in the Pennines above Manchester. The pair later took snapshots of themselves standing over the graves. </p> <p>Hindley died in prison in 2002, aged 60. She had waged a long, unsuccessful campaign to be released.</p>",
  "<p>Western politicians and commentators have been quick to seize on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">conflict in South Ossetia</a> as a defining moment in world history, or their careers. Some have been clambering to play peacemaker (Sarkozy, Kouchner), others want to boost their reputations for taking a strong line with Moscow (McCain, Miliband). But closer to Russia, in the neighbouring countries of Ukraine and Belarus, some politicians have been conspicuous by their silence.</p> <p>In Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenka has stunned the Russians with his lack of overt support. In an outburst on Tuesday, Russia's ambassador to Belarus said he was \"perplexed by the modest silence on the Belarusian side. You need to express yourself more clearly on such issues.\"</p> <p>Belarus is a member of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Russia_and_Belarus\">union state</a> with Russia, has close economic, political and social ties with the country, and has enjoyed much support from Moscow in the past \u2013 from cheap gas to the congratulations Putin sent to Lukashenka on his re-election in 2006, while others were <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/05/opinion/edbela.php\">declaring</a> him \"the last dictator in Europe\".</p> <p>But in the isolation from the west that followed his re-election in 2006, including travel bans and economic sanctions, Lukashenka also started to find that money from Russia was beginning to dry up as Moscow hiked the price of gas. Since then, the Belarusian leader has taken a series of steps to persuade the west that he is opening things up, notably by releasing a number of political prisoners. His <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL24655913\">reaction</a> to the July bombing of a concert he was attending can be viewed as a further attempt to give his regime a better image in the west.</p> <p>The EU and the US have responded, but <a href=\"http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=427&amp;issue_id=4580&amp;article_id=2373287\">made it clear</a> that any concessions are dependent on a greater degree of openness in the parliamentary elections in September.</p> <p>Coming out in support of Russia's war in Georgia could have caused irreparable damage to his plan, given the predominantly anti-Russian mood in western political circles. Lukashenka's silence, therefore, should be understood as consistent with a <a href=\"http://www.ng.ru/cis/2008-08-14/6_minsk.html?insidedoc\">gradual shift</a> in his policy towards appeasement with the EU and the US. He is, of course, playing each side off against the other. He has no desire to open politics in Belarus up any more than is necessary to get what he wants. Furthermore, the opposition in Belarus is divided and weak.</p> <p>But any opening up in Belarus must be welcomed: it shows that the west's soft power is in a position to have a positive effect in the region and may give the opposition a chance to put forward their views in a less hostile environment. Before making any concessions, however, the EU and the US need to ensure that Lukashenka is not just <a href=\"http://www.tol.cz/look/TOL/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&amp;IdPublication=4&amp;NrIssue=278&amp;NrSection=2&amp;NrArticle=19785\">window-dressing</a>.</p> <p>In Ukraine, prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko has had <a href=\"http://unian.net/rus/news/news-267167.html\">nothing to say</a> about the war. With her ability to attract support in all parts of the country, Tymoshenko is a unique figure in Ukrainian politics. As the leading contender for the 2010 presidential elections, she has no intention of alienating any part of the electorate, as demonstrated by her non-committal position on joining Nato.</p> <p>More interestingly, Tymoshenko's predecessor, Party of Regions leader Viktor Yanukovich, whom the Russians tried to propel to victory in the 2004 presidential elections, has been restrained in his comments. His party as a whole has been calling for peace and <a href=\"http://www.nr2.ru/kiev/190529.html\">criticising</a> President Viktor Yushchenko's one-sided support for Georgia, without decisively coming out on the Russian side.</p> <p>This reflects a mood in the Party of Regions \u2013 whose main support base is in the Russian-speaking east of the country \u2013 that is split between pro-Russian elements and groups with a more pro-western orientation. A Party of Regions deputy in the Verkhovna Rada I spoke to last month told me that they were in favour of Nato. The party's major backer and Europe's richest man, Rinat Akhmetov, is part of a more liberal wing of the party which is purportedly <a href=\"http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372858\">in favour</a> of a move towards Nato for business reasons. The party did not take part in anti-Nato protests during exercises in Odessa last month, nor when the secretary general visited Kiev in June.</p> <p>The Party of Regions is not likely to start campaigning in favour of Nato membership any time soon and has a tendency to exploit and inflame this divisive issue \u2013 such as during the Nato exercises in Feodosia in 2006 \u2013 in order to garner votes. But these are further signs that the west's soft power is having an influence on Ukrainian politicians. The reactions of Lukashenka and Yanukovich to the conflict in South Ossetia show that Russia's military victory does not herald the whitewash in the region that many have been proclaiming. If Russia's intervention in Georgia has made some fear that the country's territorial ambitions are unstoppable, calm analysis points to a more complex picture.</p>",
  "<p>With yet another election victory in the bag, Cambodia's prime minister, Hun Sen, is now entering his thirty-fourth year in power. Hun Sen draws his inspiration not from south-east Asia's more democratic leaders, but from Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, who used dictatorial methods to build a modern, prosperous but tightly-controlled island city-state. Still only 57, Hun Sen has now served two years longer than Lee Kuan Yew \u2013 and even muses that he could still be premier at 90 if the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) keeps winning elections. It is this prospect, however fanciful, that alarms many educated Cambodians.</p> <p>Trade unionists, opposition parties, and human rights workers have well-founded fears that this landslide election victory could lead to a clampdown on the right to protest and strike in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cambodia\">Cambodia</a> - human rights that were crushed long ago in Singapore under Lee Kuan Yew's notorious Internal Security Act. </p> <p>Hun Sen is the son of a poor farming family in Kompong Cham province, and a former Khmer Rouge officer who rebelled against Pol Pot, fled to Vietnam in 1977 and returned two years later as foreign minister, backed by the Vietnamese army. Still younger than any of his Asean counterparts, he now ranks as their most experienced prime minister. And he achieved all this despite losing an eye in the final battle to defeat the US-backed military regime of General Lon Nol back in 1975.</p> <p>Only Prince Norodom Sihanouk's rule in the 1960s can be compared with Hun Sen's in terms of its strong leadership and its success in defining the politics and development of the country. Between these two eras, the nation was brought to the brink of extinction by the secret US bombing of Cambodia authored by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, which ultimately helped Pol Pot's forces to seize power.</p> <p>Now, after a period of survival in the 1980s \u2013 moulded in part by Vietnamese communism mixed with a revival of Cambodian culture \u2013 everything is changing. The free market <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/26/cambodia\">reigns supreme</a>. Land and property speculation is everything, heritage is for sale, and the US dollar is king. Land that was owned by poor farmers in the 1980s is now up for grabs \u2013 and indeed frequently is <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA23/011/2008/en/73ad5b25-5e48-11dd-a592-c739f9b70de8/asa230112008eng.html\">grabbed</a> by a few tycoons linked to Hun Sen. The PM is generally regarded as part of a nouveau riche <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jun/01/conservation.internationalnews\">kleptocracy</a> that siphons off foreign aid and ignores protests about human rights. But defenders of the CPP, and many of the people who have just voted for it, would point out that under his leadership the country is now at peace. Schools, roads and bridges have been built. The economy is booming, and the CPP has been justly rewarded. Few international observers seriously doubt that the democratic will swung behind the CPP, even allowing for unbalanced TV media coverage. (Unlike neighbouring countries, all Cambodia elections since 1993 have been monitored by international observers.)</p> <p>In the 1980s Hun Sen \u2013 who was widely derided as a Vietnamese puppet at the time - had two priorities. The first was to stop the Khmer Rouge from returning to power (they were backed militarily by China and diplomatically by the west). The second was to rebuild a shattered nation. </p> <p>The fragile government in Phnom Penh not only kept Pot's forces at bay, but their Vietnamese backers speedily restored some basic services. After 1979 hospitals, schools, markets, Buddhist temples and cinemas - closed by the Khmer Rouge - were rapidly reopened by Hun Sen's government. Hun Sen initiated peace talks with Cambodia's exiled <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norodom_Sihanouk\">Prince Sihanouk</a>, which eventually led to his return. He proved to be an inspirational leader, but much western reporting during the Cold War focused on the partisan belief that Cambodia was under foreign occupation. There was an abysmal failure to report the real story of a nation's dramatic recovery, despite the UN's cynical denial of aid to a desperately poor country.</p> <p>I first met Hun Sen in 1981, and respect his achievements in helping to bring about the rebirth of his nation and ending the Khmer Rouge terror in the countryside. But from the point of view of public services and the treatment of the poor, his record since the 1993 elections leaves a great deal to be desired. His failure to build an equitable Cambodian society that all can share in, based on social and economic justice \u2013 not just a real estate boom \u2013 is lamentable.</p> <p>It is strange that Hun Sen, who shares his humble beginnings with Brazil's Lula and Bolivia's Evo Morales, has no agenda for the poor, no instinct to curb the grotesque excesses of the ruling elite, and has made no attempt to protect the small farmers that he is descended from. For all his intelligence and political skills, Hun Sen's success was based on survival, not a vision of the future. Bolstered by the recent discovery of offshore oil, the CPP has no development model other than the prescriptions of the IMF and World Bank, which are easily grafted onto the corruption and get rich-quick mentality of his business cronies, military generals and his police chiefs. </p> <p>If he had gracefully stepped down from power in 1998,<br>after the final surrender of the Khmer Rouge, Hun Sen's place in history would surely have been assured. Unless he changes tack, the dispossessed may have to resort to other means to achieve justice.</p>",
  "<p>A government minister today challenged the Prince of Wales to prove his claim that firms developing genetically modified crops risked environmental disaster.</p> <p>\"If it has been a disaster then please provide the evidence,\" said Phil Woolas, the environment minister, in an <a href=\"(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/2571514/Prince-Charles-wrong-on-GM-says-minister.html\">interview with the Sunday Telegraph</a>.</p> <p>He accused Prince Charles of ignoring the needs of the world's poorest countries by attacking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gmcrops\">GM crops</a>, and insisted the government would go ahead with trials unless scientific evidence showed they were harmful.</p> <p>On Wednesday, after the prince told the Daily Telegraph that GM crops were an experiment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/prince.charles.gm.farming\">\"gone seriously wrong\"</a>, the government said it welcomed all voices in the debate and stressed that safety was its priority.</p> <p>But in highly critical comments that suggest high-level anger at the prince's intervention, Woolas said the government had a \"moral responsibility\" to investigate whether GM crops could help alleviate hunger in the developing world. It was easy for people in countries where food was plentiful to ignore the potential of GM to raise agricultural productivity, he said.</p> <p>\"I'm grateful to Prince Charles for raising the issue. He raises some very important doubts that are held by many people. But government ministers have a responsibility to base policy on science and I do strongly believe that we have a moral responsibility to the developing world to ask the question: can GM crops help?</p> <p>\"I don't understand the reasoning behind the assertion that this is dangerous for climate change.\"</p> <p>Woolas stressed the government had yet to decide whether it should relax the controls on the cultivation of GM crops. </p> <p>\"Should the UK change our policy on GM to one that is more liberal?\" he said. \"The government has not got a predetermined decision.\"</p> <p>The Sunday Telegraph quoted a Labour source as saying the prince had \"overstepped the mark\". The newspaper quoted a source close to the prince as saying he did not intend to cause a political row and \"simply cares for the future\".</p> <p>Green groups including Friends of the Earth and the Soil Association supported the prince's view that GM crops would not help to solve the food crisis.</p>",

  "<p>Elena Dementieva may not get the warmest of welcomes when she arrives at the US Open next week, for the new Olympic champion just couldn't help reminding everyone that the Olympic Games was the real deal. \"I can't even compare a grand slam to the Olympic Games, it's just so much bigger. This is what I was waiting for. This is what I was working for. This is the biggest moment in my career, my life,\" she said.</p> <p>It is as you would expect the 26-year-old to react after her three-set victory - 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 - over her compatriot Dinara Safina, but some might say that she would be a better judge when she actually wins a grand slam tournament, or even reaches a final. Dementieva came close at Wimbledon this year, losing in the semi-finals, and was going quite well into the French Open until her progress was blocked by Safina in the quarter-finals. </p> <p>Safina, who seems to have been around for an awful long time for a 22-year-old, met her compatriot three times this summer and won the lot and in the first set at the Olympic Green Tennis Centre looked for all the world that she would win this one too. But in a match where the front of the court played little part, Dementieva, who had won the silver medal at Sydney in 2004, was commendably dogged. </p> <p>She took 66 minutes to win an error-ridden second set, and was helped in the decider by the fact that Safina held her serve only once. Perhaps, the real difference between the two players was that one wanted it more than the other, and if you believe it's the greatest tournament in the history of the world, that helps. The bronze medal went to Vera Zvonareva, who beat China's Li Na 6-0, 7-5. It gave the Russian team a sweep of the medals.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Venus and Serena Williams put their singles disappointment behind them to win the women's doubles with a straight-sets victory over the Spanish duo of Anabel Medina Garrigues and Virginia Ruano Pascual.

  "<p>When I was in Beijing in July, I had the China Daily \u2013 the state-run English language newspaper \u2013 delivered to my hotel room every morning. On my last day in the city, July 18, I almost dropped my croissant when I opened the paper and saw a report about me.</p> <p>Shortly before leaving London for Beijing, I had given a speech at the <a href=\"http://www.battleofideas.org.uk/index.php/2008/strand/1138/\">Battle for China</a>, a conference organised by the Institute of Ideas, at which I argued that western governments have no moral authority to lecture anybody \u2013 including the Chinese \u2013 about human rights. I argued that respect for liberty is at a historic low in America and Europe, where governments think nothing of introducing 42-day detention without charge, spying on us through CCTV cameras or email surveillance, and bringing in new thought crimes \u2013 and therefore asking President Bush or our own beleaguered PM to pressurise China to \"embrace liberty\" was a bit like \"asking Rose West to open a halfway house for young runaways\".</p> <p>China Daily reported my <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2008-07/18/content_6857619.htm\">comments</a> (including the joke about Rose West), telling its readers that a British journalist had said that Bush and Brown should not be called upon to help \"liberate China\" since \"people in the moral gutter cannot take the moral high ground\". I was even more startled when I discovered that an article I wrote for <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/specials/article4329902.ece\">Times Online</a> to accompany my speech in London had been republished in the <a href=\"http://world.people.com.cn/GB/57507/7514447.html\">People's Daily</a>, the main organ of the central committee of the Communist party of China.</p> <p>Two of my articles for Comment is free have also been republished in China \u2013 both times without my, or the Guardian's, permission and both times in a politically truncated form.</p> <p>In June, China Daily republished my Cif piece calling the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/29/downwiththedalailama\">Dalai Lama</a> a \"ridiculous\" political figure who has been embraced by western governments as a \"battering ram in their culture war with China\". However, it cut the line that said: \"Tibetans now suffer the double horror of being ruled by undemocratic Chinese officials on one hand, and demeaned by the Dalai Lama and his western supporters on the other.\"</p> <p>More recently, on the day the Olympics kicked off, China Daily re-ran my Cif piece on why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/25/china?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=worldnews\">Chinese people</a> are optimistic about their country's future but western observers \u2013 who tend to find industrialisation and economic growth rather distasteful these days \u2013 are not. But it <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2008-08/08/content_6915766.htm\">forgot to include</a> my conclusion: \"Chinese people's material lives are improving; let us hope their political lives rapidly improve, too.\"</p> <p>I've had a flurry of outraged emails. \"So are you now actually in the pay of the Chinese Communist party, you unbelievable bastard?\" \u2013 that kind of thing. That's not surprising, considering that many people immediately assume that anyone who criticises western China-bashing, thinks economic growth in China is a good thing, or refuses to swear an oath of allegiance to the gospel according to Human Rights Watch must surely receive from Beijing wads of yuan stained with the blood of protesters massacred in Tiananmen Square. (It really didn't help matters when, around the same time, the state-run Zimbabwe Herald republished an article of mine attacking <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200804090075.html\">western intervention in Zimbabwe</a>. Thanks a lot, Mugabe.)</p> <p>No, I'm not in the pay of Chinese state officials; I didn't even know they were planning to republish my articles. However, the re-emergence of some of my work in China is revealing.</p> <p>First, it shows that Chinese editors take a more cavalier approach to copyright issues than most western editors do. As an internationalist, I'm not opposed to seeing my arguments republished in China, or anywhere else. But there must be a more upfront, fruitful way that ideas can be shared across borders which doesn't involve simply taking articles and submitting them to a rush-job edit. An open and honest sharing of content between the east and west, based on respect for copyright, would be a great way to break down cultural barriers.</p> <p>Second, it actually shows how rife is China-bashing in the west. At a time when there is an extraordinary left/right, transatlantic consensus that China is a threat \u2013 encompassing everyone from white-haired rightwingers in America offended by China's economic rise to trendy students in Britain who think China is polluting their pristine parks in with its global smog \u2013 it seems Chinese editors are on the lookout for sceptical western voices that say something different.</p> <p>In today's borderline Sinophobic climate, perhaps my articles \u2013 and those of a handful of other journalists, too \u2013 have been snapped up as evidence that not everyone in the west thinks China's economic growth is a filthy disaster or that its human rights abuses in Tibet and elsewhere are somehow more unusually cruel and barbaric than those of our own governments in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p> <p>This is a two-way street: Chinese state editors should be more upfront about which of our articles they want to reprint, and western reporters should do more to challenge the simple-minded demonisation of China, which \u2013 who knows \u2013 may be a contributing factor in their apparent unwillingness to engage.</p>"
