  "<p>The owner of the Independent and Independent on Sunday wants to merge the newspapers' 'back office' functions such as human resources, IT and accounts with those of other publishers in order to slash costs.</p> <p>Independent News &amp; Media (INM) also warned today that it is looking to axe jobs across its businesses in the face of a worsening advertising market, which has seen retail and brand advertising plunge in the UK.</p> <p>In a trading update, which INM's rebel shareholder Denis O'Brien branded as \"grim reading\", INM said its UK national newspapers are \"in discussions with a number of other UK national publishers on a shared-services basis that is expected to deliver substantial efficiencies and is designed to create more efficient editorial work flows, while preserving the unique editorial ethos of The Independent\".</p> <p>The company is already believed to be close to one deal which would see some of its non-editorial newspaper functions effectively shared with another publisher. But O'Brien, who is engaged in a fierce war or words with INM's chief executive and largest shareholder, Sir Anthony O'Reilly, reiterated his call for the company to dispose of its UK assets describing them as \"a drain on group resources\". </p> <p>Also today, INM said it had received offers for its 39.1% stake in APN News &amp; Media, which owns the New Zealand Herald. Analysts reckon the stake could be worth well over \u20ac300m (\u00a3236m). Disposing of the business would also remove a substantial chunk of APN's debts from INM's balance sheet. INM said yesterday that selling out could reduce group debt from its current level of \u20ac1.4bn to under \u20ac600m.</p> <p>INM's drive to cut costs and reduce its debts, comes as the global economic crisis takes its toll on the advertising market. The company, which owns newspapers and other media assets in Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the Far East, said its recent performance in the UK and Ireland has been particularly weak.</p> <p>During September and October, property and recruitment advertising continued the \"very weak\" trend set earlier in the year. </p> <p>\"However, the main downturn in advertising over this period, compared to the performance in the first half of 2008, has been in the national brand and retail categories in Ireland and the UK (which had been ahead year-on-year to that point),\" it added.</p> <p>In the year so far, INM's operating profits are down 10%. For the year as a whole, the company now expects total revenues to be down 11% - in euros - with advertising down 2.5% in local currencies and overall profits - in euros - to be down between 15% and 17%.</p> <p>\"The current volatile nature of global financial and economic markets make it extremely difficult to reliably forecast for 2009 at this early stage,\" the company added.</p> <p>\"While we believe this volatility is likely to continue for some time, we believe that the recent easing of interest rates across our markets, with the increased probability of further rate reductions, will assist in halting the current economic weakness and may lead to some growth towards the second half of 2009.\"</p> <p>\"Assuming the economic outlook and conditions for advertising in our markets do not deteriorate any further\" the company said revenues next year will be down \"only marginally\" on 2008.</p> <p>O'Brien, who has a 26% shareholder in the company, said \"the interim management statement makes grim reading\".</p> <p>\"Despite the deteriorating financial performance the board has pursued a policy of share buy backs... and has failed to address key issues facing the business. Indeed, with each downturn advertisers are finding more value in the internet and digital marketing, which frankly the INM management team seems to have no strategy to address.\"</p> <p>As for news that INM has received what it called \"a number of unsolicited expressions of interest\" in its stake in APN - which INM has held for a decade - O'Brien said: \"I find it hard to understand why they are considering the sale of one of the group's best performing assets in a falling market.\"</p>",
  "<p>The billionaire sheikh who last month bought Manchester City football club was among a group of oil-rich investors that announced a deal to buy almost a third of Barclays Bank.</p> <p>While the rest of the world hunkers down to take shelter from the financial crisis, the Arab Gulf states, awash with petrodollars as the oil price reached $147 (\u00a391) a barrel over the summer, are still spending freely. Royal families and government-backed funds from the region have been collecting a growing portfolio of assets, including stakes in supermarket chain Sainsbury and the London Stock Exchange, the Chrysler Building in New York and Aston Martin. </p> <p>Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi, has agreed to pump \u00a33.5bn into Barclays for a 16% stake. The Qatar royal family, one of the most prolific investors in the region, is aiming to build up its existing holding in Barclays to more than 15% by injecting another \u00a32.3bn.</p> <p>The investment was announced as the prime minister, Gordon Brown, was preparing to head to the region for a four-day visit to plead with oil-rich nations to play their part in stabilising the world financial system by abandoning attempts to increase the price of oil by cutting production and by investing their multi-trillion dollar profits in ailing economies.</p> <p>The price of oil has slumped as the faltering world economy has weakened demand but the high prices of recent years have still left many families and governments in the region enormously wealthy. Mansour's family is estimated to be worth $750bn, fuelling speculation that the billionaire would indulge in a game of fantasy football at Manchester City by using his vast wealth to buy up the world's best players. He is minister of presidential affairs, chairman of the Abu Dhabi state oil firm and is married to the daughter of the ruler of Dubai.</p> <p>Mansour's part in the Barclays deal was brokered by Amanda Staveley, a senior partner at the private equity firm PCP Gulf Partners. She owned a restaurant near Newmarket racecourse where she built relationships with some of the wealthy horse breeders from the Gulf region. She also helped to agree the deal to buy Manchester City. She described the Barclays investment as \"a vote for the UK financial system as a whole\".</p> <p>The Qatar investment was led by Sheikh Hamad Bin Jabr Al-Thani, a member of the royal family and the Qatar prime minister. The Qataris already own 25% of Sainsbury's, 20% of the London Stock Exchange and are leading the \u00a31bn consortium to redevelop London's Chelsea Barracks.</p> <p>The Barclays deal allows the bank to strengthen its balance sheet without taking taxpayers' money. Mansour is understood to have been looking at Barclays for some time but contacted the bank when it said it would not take part in the government bail-out. Barclays boss John Varley noted that \"there has been quite a significant shift in the availability of capital and economic power in the world over the past five years.\"</p> <p>Will Hadfield, of the Middle East Economic Digest, said the gulf states have \"very detailed plans to remove their dependency on oil stretching out to 20 or 30 years. They are diversifying away and creating industries not reliant on the oil price and part of that is investing overseas. They are looking for flagship assets, companies with powerful brands that will be around for a very long time.\"</p> <p>Many of the deals are strategic but others, like Manchester City, are part of an eagerness to put the small gulf states on the map. Abu Dhabi hopes to rebrand itself as a cultural oasis by attracting new Louvre and Guggenheim museums and a branch of the Sorbonne, France's most prestigious university. Until the 1960s, the tiny kingdom's main source of income was camel herding.</p> <p>Brown will tomorrow take a delegation of 27 British business leaders and two of his closest cabinet colleagues, Lord Mandelson and Ed Miliband, on the visit to drum up support for a three-point plan to help with the downturn. </p> <p>He wants the region's government's to adopt a \"transparent\" approach to oil. In addition, Brown wants the oil-rich states to invest billions of dollars from their foreign exchange reserves into the International Monetary Fund. Brown believes the IMF's $250bn fund, of which $29bn is being pumped into the Hungarian and Ukrainian economies, needs to be bolstered and that countries with large surpluses, principally oil producing countries in the Gulf and China, should shore up the IMF.</p> <p>Downing Street denied Brown would take a begging bowl to the Gulf. No 10 said: \"He is not going cap in hand. He recognises that it is in everyone's interests that there is stability and growth in global markets and that is equally in the interests of the Gulf region. They have significant wealth and resources that can contribute to refunding stability in the global financial system.\"</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339194016\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Britain is joining a growing international diplomatic effort to end the interminable conflict in eastern <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congo\">Congo</a> with the foreign secretary, David Miliband, expected to fly to Goma tomorrow amid increasing questions about the effectiveness of the United Nations peacekeeping mission there.</p> <p>Miliband is travelling with his French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, to the beleaguered east Congolese town as well as Congo's capital, Kinshasa, and neighbouring Rwanda. They are following in the footsteps of the top US envoy for Africa, Jendayi Frazer, as the EU considers sending forces to the area and the UN appeals for more troops for what is already the largest peacekeeping force in the world.</p> <p>But the visits come amid concern that UN peacekeepers in eastern Congo are effectively fighting a war that government forces are fleeing and in doing so are siding with extremist Hutus responsible for the genocide in neighbouring Rwanda.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/31/congo-united-nations\">Critics of the UN operation</a> - and some of its own staff - say the mission is complicating efforts to reach a peace settlement because, instead of pressing the disarmament of all major rebel groups, the UN has effectively taken sides against the Tutsi rebel leader, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/30/congo1\">Laurent Nkunda</a>, on behalf of a government whose own forces are deeply implicated in human rights abuses and more interested in making money from gold smuggling than fighting. The government's army is also allied with exiled Rwandan Hutu rebels.</p> <p>But UN officials in Congo privately say they have been left by the major powers to do an impossible job because of lack of international political will to confront the causes of more than a decade of conflict that has claimed about 5m lives, mostly from disease, and left more than one million as refugees.</p> <p>As tens of thousands fled the latest upsurge in fighting this week, people vented their anger at the UN's inability or failure to fulfil its basic mandate of protecting civilian lives.</p> <p>Residents of Goma stoned UN compounds in the town as Nkunda's forces marched toward the town and government forces fled. Refugees pelted UN convoys with rocks, critically injuring an Indian army officer.</p> <p>In response, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon said peacekeepers in Congo are \"doing everything possible to protect civilians and fulfil their mandate in untenable circumstances\". One UN official said untenable meant that peacekeepers were expected to fight when the government's own army will not.</p> <p>Alan Doss, the UN envoy to Congo, said the peacekeepers have served with \"really great distinction\" but that there are not enough of them to fulfil the mandate of protecting the civilian population.</p> <p>The UN has 17,000 troops in Congo. About one-third of them are in North Kivu, the most conflict-riven province, mostly from India.</p> <p>But critics say that more troops are not the answer because the UN has been given a role it cannot fulfil and has become deeply compromised as a result.</p> <p>Neil Campbell, a researcher for the International Crisis Group who recently visited Goma, said it was never feasible to expect the UN to protect civilians outside of a few urban areas given the vastness of eastern Congo and the array of armed groups preying on people.</p> <p>\"The UN has been projected as the body that's going to bring democracy and stabilisation to the north east of Congo which is completely unrealistic,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The problem is the UN has been forced in to fighting by the disintegration of the (government's) army. When I was in Goma, the sense of a lack of discipline and any kind of military cohesion within the armed forces is incredible. This is what you can see has happened in the last few days. It's really been the armed forces that have been running away from the rebels, so the UN has been forced into a role that it wasn't supposed to be taking.\"</p> <p>After the failure of UN peacekeeping during the Rwandan genocide, the mission to Congo was given a strong mandate to use as much force as deemed necessary to protect civilians. But that has done little to prevent staggering human rights abuses.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch has criticised the UN not only for failing to prevent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/29/congo.humanrights\">systematic rape </a>across eastern Congo, where it is effectively a weapon of war and terror, but also for remaining virtually silent about such crimes against humanity.</p> <p>Instead, the UN has concentrated on trying to prevent the various rebel groups from taking over major towns. But in doing so it has been drawn in on one side of the conflict on the grounds that it was defending a democratic government in Kinshasa.</p> <p>But that role was compromised because government forces were often responsible for their own human rights abuses, including murder and rape, and are heavily involved in making money from illegal mining operations.</p> <p>Global Witness recently accused sections of the Congolese army of mining gold and tin in league with the Rwandan Hutu rebel group, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), whose leaders are heavily implicated in the 1994 genocide.</p> <p>Some UN peacekeepers have also been accused of involvement in the illegal mining trade and gold smuggling.</p> <p>Congo's president, Laurent Kabila, has also been protecting the FDLR, which controls large parts of eastern Congo, because its forces have proven more willing to fight than his own troops and have gone into combat against Nkunda who has had the backing of Rwanda, at least in the past.</p> <p>All that has left UN forces fighting with, and effectively protecting, not only the illegal mining trade but forces responsible for mass murder in neighbouring Rwanda.</p> <p>UN officials also privately accuse the Congolese army of forcing peacekeepers into action by attacking Nkunda's men forces and then retreating, leaving the UN to defend positions.</p> <p>Campbell says the scramble for control of lucrative mines remains a driving force behind the conflict.</p> <p>\"Everyone is gaining something from the North Kivu crisis, political or economic interests. There's active collaboration between the army and the FDLR. At the moment the army appears to be doing more of this business activities with the FDLR than actually functioning as the army itself,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Nkunda presents himself as being the protector of the Tutsis in North Kivu. He's nothing of the sort. He's not a freedom fighter, his primary goal is economic and political interests. He's supported by Tutsi businessmen in Goma that are using him for their ends. The areas he controls contain mining concessions they receive funds from.\"</p> <p>\"At this stage it's not additional troops that's going to protect civilians. It's international political pressure on Rwanda and Kinshasa to pull Nkunda and the FDLR back and to get the peace agreements underway,\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>We begin in Scotland this week, with two delicate exhibitions from Ruth Claxton and Richard Forster at the newly supersized <a href=\"http://www.inglebygallery.com/\">Ingleby Gallery</a> in Edinburgh. I'm interested to see Forster's sublimely drawn, painstaking seascapes. Those foamy waves <a href=\"http://www.inglebygallery.com/exhibition_detail.php?id=92\">captured as they graze the shore</a> look as though a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/gallery/2007/may/25/1?picture=329929147\">Vija Celmins</a> artwork has washed up in front of you, intimately lapping at your toes. Next door, <a href=\"http://www.inglebygallery.com/exhibition_detail.php?imageID=1651&amp;id=\" 91\" \">Claxton</a> explores her fascination with vision in a series of postcards of historical paintings. Small sections of each image are meticulously sliced away, leaving shapes that eerily shoot out of the subjects' eyes. Claxton also plays with the subject of \"the gaze\" in her ceramic works: recently these have been presented on towering, mirror-clad stands that reflect our stares whilst obscuring the faces of the tiny figurines. This body of work can be seen concurrently at <a href=\"http://www.orieldavies.org/?url_subsection_id=5\">Oriel Davis Gallery</a> in Powys, Wales.</p> <p>Those of you in Sheffield have recently enjoyed playing host to Pil &amp; Galia Kollectiv as artists in residence at <a href=\"http://www.s1artspace.org/\">S1 Artspace</a>, who now celebrate the end of their tenure with an exhibition in grand style. Photographs and documents relate to rehearsals of Svetlana, an opera inspired by Stalin's daughter that was never performed. The artists begin with a few facts, then weave them into an enormous fictional narrative that includes sound weaponry alongside Bauhaus, punk and geometric costumes. </p> <p>Fantasy and reality also collide in Bristol, where there is one week left to see Romanian artist <a href=\"http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/exhibitions/details/116\">Mircea Cantor's poetic exhibition at Arnolfini</a>. In The Need for Uncertainty, Cantor gracefully weaves the modern world into folk traditions and fairytales from his homeland (literally in the case of a flying carpet woven with images of wolves' teeth and aeroplanes). </p> <p>If the dark evenings are driving you to despair then the light of cinema's flickering projectors may light your path to a gallery this week. Turner prize-winner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/124579/hunger\">Steve McQueen's film Hunger</a> finally finishes the long journey from Cannes to national cinemas today, but those with an appetite for seeing McQueen's gallery-based artwork can see an installation at <a href=\"http://www.balticmill.com/\">Baltic</a> in Gateshead, where the galloping barrage of images from one video, Pursuit, is counterpoised by the rattling projection of Running Thunder, a 16mm film of a horse lying motionless in a meadow, which plays in the same room. </p> <p>While McQueen may have won the Camera d'Or, Pierre Bismuth is the only contemporary artist (thus far) to receive an Oscar, for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with Michel Gondry in 2005. The artist and director pair up to reprise the theme of erasing memory at the <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/whatson/bfi_southbank/exhibitions/bfi_southbank_gallery\">BFI Southbank Gallery</a> with a new commission, The All-Seeing Eye (The Hardcore-Techno Version). Here, a dizzying 360\u02da film environment pans continuously around a room on a rotating projector. The details of the room change when you aren't looking, all achieved with geekily lo-fi technology using a tiny doll-sized set complete with minute Warhol Brillo boxes. Experience amnesiac terror as your own memory flails and fails to capture the room's changing landscape before everything is snatched away from you.</p> <p>Over at <a href=\"http://www.storegallery.co.uk\">Store</a> in Hoxton, London, Ryan Gander's exhibition takes Julian Schnabel's 1996 film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115632/\">Basquiat</a> as its title and starting point. Riffing on our difficulty to nail down complex creatures like artworks and loved ones, Gander recreates a scene from Schnabel's film with a voiceover that describes the ambiguous nature of one artist's homage to another. These themes are further explored in the rest of the exhibition, creating a delicate polemic, which suggests that we might kill our favourite things if we try and pin them down too hard.</p> <p>Lastly, the ICA's excellent <a href=\"http://www.ica.org.uk/?lid=16694\">Nought to Sixty</a> programme ends this Sunday, coming to rest with exhibitions from Fiona Jardine and Duncan Campbell. I've enjoyed lots of these exhibitions and events this year, and after a quick and refreshing 60 projects in six months, cue a round of applause and a big closing party on Sunday. Visit the last exhibition if you can, and expect to see many of the artists from the programme reappearing in the coming years to light the future's skies.</p>",
  "<p>Popular farmland birds like turtle dove, grey partridge and linnet have declined to their lowest level on record, with some species becoming extinct in regions of the UK, according to figures released today.</p> <p>The latest survey, by the Department for Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, shows the number of breeding pairs of farmland birds has now more than halved since intensive farming with chemicals was introduced in the 1960s.</p> <p>Conservationists are particularly alarmed that the latest fall follows an earlier halt in the long-term decline for a few years from 1999-2005, and mystified about the cause because European farming subsidies are supposed to pay farmers to introduce wildlife-friendly practices.</p> <p>Experts also warned that the latest figures for 2005-07 do not take account of a forecast drop in populations this year because of the abolition of payments to farmers to \"set aside\" land for feed and nesting sites.</p> <p>Grahame Madge, a spokesman for the RSPB, said some species had declined more than 85%, leading to local extinctions, including the corn bunting in Northern Ireland and yellow wagtails in Devon.</p> <p>\"Since the 1970s the economy has gone through a cycle of boom and bust, but farmland birds have had bust year after year,\" said Madge. \"In some areas those birds are becoming locally scarce if not locally extinct because the populations have declined so much [that] the little populations left are burning out.\"</p> <p>However the figures were attacked by the National Farmers Union (NFU), which said it was too soon to see the benefits of recent improvements in management. It said the study did not include some farmland birds which were increasing in numbers. The organisation also suggested declines in birds which nest on the ground, such as lapwing and grey partridge, could be due to increases in predators. </p> <p>\"Farmland birds, including the swallow, magpie, collared dove and chaffinch \u2013 none of which are included in the farmland bird index \u2013 have all increased in population over the past 30 years,\" added Paul Temple, the NFU's vice-president.</p> <p>The 2007 Wild Bird Populations report shows seabird numbers also fell slightly, but total wild bird populations, which also include woodland and water and wetland species, were stable.</p> <p>However farmland birds are considered by government and biodiversity experts to be a key indicator of the health of the countryside. </p> <p>Their loss is also a blow to nature lovers, said Madge: \"These are the birds seen by people walking along country lanes and hedgerows that are really part of the fabric of the countryside. They are part of our quality of life ... hearing the song of a sky lark is part of the cultural fabric.\" </p> <p>Other affected species include the tree sparrow and the skylark.</p> <p>Wildlife minister Huw Irranca-Davies said some species like the goldfinch and kingfisher were doing well, but called for \"renewed action\" to halt the decline of other species. </p> <p>However the Conservatives accused the government of threatening conservation schemes by cutting budgets to key organisations like Natural England, whose work includes protecting and restoring the most threatened species, including farmland birds, normally in partnership with charities. </p> <p>\"It's going to be increasingly difficult to carry out this work if the government doesn't support it in the way it was,\" said Peter Ainsworth, the Conservative shadow environment secretary, and chairman of one of the charities working in the field. \"Recovery may well be affected.\"</p> <p>The RSPB said its own farm in Cambridgeshire showed it was possible to produce the same food and profits while also helping birds and other wildlife with changes like leaving small patches of land free from crops, and planting wildflower and nectar flower seeds for birds and insects to feed on. </p> <p>Since the charity took over the farm in 1999, farm birds on their land have doubled while the national tally has fallen by 6%. \"We're not talking about turning the clock back to farmers using horse-drawn ploughs; there is a middle ground,\" added Madge.</p>",
  "<p>Trees could be more important to the Earth's climate than previously thought, according to a new study that reveals forests help to block out the sun. </p> <p>Scientists in the UK and Germany have discovered that trees release a chemical that thickens clouds above them, which reflects more sunlight and so cools the Earth. The research suggests that chopping down forests could accelerate global warming more than was thought, and that protecting existing trees could be one of the best ways to tackle the problem.</p> <p>Dominick Spracklen, of the Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science at Leeds University, said: \"We think this could have quite a significant effect. You can think of forests as climate air conditioners.\"</p> <p>The scientists looked at chemicals called terpenes that are released from boreal forests across northern regions such as Canada, Scandinavia and Russia. The chemicals give pine forests their distinctive smell, but their function has puzzled experts for years. Some believe the trees release them to communicate, while others say they could offer protection from air pollution.</p> <p>The team found the terpenes react in the air to form tiny particles called aerosols. The particles help turn water vapour in the atmosphere into clouds.</p> <p>Spracklen said the team's computer models showed that the pine particles doubled the thickness of clouds some 1,000m above the forests, and would reflect an extra 5% sunlight back into space. </p> <p>He said: \"It might not sound a lot, but that is quite a strong cooling effect. The climate is such a finely balanced system that we think this effect is large enough to reduce temperatures over quite large areas. It gives us another reason to preserve forests.\" </p> <p>The research, which will be published in a special edition of the Royal Society journal Philosophical Transactions A, is the first to quantify the cooling effect of the released chemicals. The scientists say the findings \"must be included in climate models in order to make realistic predictions\".</p> <p>Because trees release more terpenes in warmer weather, the discovery suggests that forests could act as a negative feedback on climate, to dampen future temperature rise. The team looked at forests of mainly pine and spruce trees, but Spracklen said other trees also produce terpenes so the cooling effect should be found in other regions, including tropical rainforests.</p>",

  "<p>Gordon Brown pledged that his government would make greater efforts to end pensioner poverty, fuel poverty and antisocial behaviour as he gave Labour's crucial byelection campaign in Glenrothes a final push today.</p> <p>The prime minister made his second visit to the Fife constituency in less than a week today, in a bid to put his personal stamp on the campaign and capitalise on signs that Labour could be close to winning the byelection.</p> <p>With bookmakers now predicting Labour may win next Thursday because of a \"Brown bounce\" with the financial crisis, the Labour leader spent more than four hours meeting voters, including Scottish National party supporters and the undecided, and touring a local skylight factory, defence contractor and party campaign office.</p> <p>With further complaints from Scottish financiers today about the sale of HBOS to Lloyds TSB dogging his visit, Brown conceded that voters were facing tough financial times and that the UK was heading for recession. </p> <p>\"We are fighting for every vote,\" he said. His government was successfully steering the UK through the global crisis, but \"was doing it fairly\".</p> <p>In contrast, the SNP had \"not done right by Scotland.\" He added: \"They have made all the wrong judgments on all the wrong policy decisions about major issues affecting our country \u2026 We have to make the right decisions, we have to take people through long-term difficulties.\"</p> <p>The SNP had initially been clear favourites to overturn a 10,664-vote Labour majority, inflicting its second byelection defeat on the government this year and the fourth so far since Brown became prime minister.</p> <p>Labour has held the seat or its near equivalent for almost 60 years. Glenrothes borders Brown's own Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency, and until the banking crisis and his performance at the Labour conference, many believed defeat in Glenrothes could have ended his leadership. </p> <p>Bookmakers have recently narrowed the odds against Labour winning, suggesting it may now be neck-and-neck. Labour's internal polling shows it has closed the gap with the SNP and may be ahead of the nationalists \u2013 data that underpins Brown's decision to publicly stake his own credibility on the campaign. </p> <p>At one social club in the former mining town of Cardenden, only eight miles north of his Kirkcaldy birthplace, Brown spent 40 minutes talking to about 50 voters, and stressed his links to the area. \"I come from Fife. I'm part of Fife. I want to be here to talk to people in Fife and hear what their concerns are,\" the prime minister said.</p> <p>He was also introduced to several SNP supporters, including a Church of Scotland minister, the Rev Mitchell Collins, who is also a neighbour of Labour's candidate, Lindsay Roy. </p> <p>Collins did not keep to the Labour script. He is a lifetime SNP voter but he did not tell Brown that; he felt it would be rude to do so. Despite half an hour of intensive persuasion by John Park, a Labour MSP and byelection campaign leader, and several minutes talking with the prime minister about fuel poverty, apprenticeships and pensioners, Collins will still vote SNP on Thursday.</p> <p>\"I'm a big fan of Alex Salmond's,\" he said afterwards. \"Alex Salmond can speak for the Scottish people better than any other of the leaders in Scotland. Brown is best for Britain, and no one can hold a candle to him, but I still see Salmond as better for Scotland.\"</p> <p>One voter close to voting SNP for the first time who was swayed by Brown was Jeanette Hoggan, a home carer. </p> <p>\"I was thinking of voting SNP. I just wanted to see if they would make a difference. I do support independence, but Lindsay Roy was very impressive, and I think the prime minister was very good. I think their policies are good now, particularly dealing with young people.\"</p> <p>Adele Shanks, 44, said she would be voting for the first time on Thursday, and for Labour, after working with Roy as a supply teacher at Kirkcaldy high school, Brown's old school, which has endured years of pupil indiscipline and falling standards. </p> <p>Shanks said: \"I have to say I'm impressed at him. I see the difference he's made since he has come along to Kirkcaldy high school, the difference he has made to the pupils, the respect they now have for themselves.\"</p> <p>Brown too claimed Roy was the ideal candidate \u2013 the \"non-politician\" who can better understand local concerns. \"Lindsay as a headteacher has huge experience of how to deal with antisocial behaviour, helping young people realise their potential and helping young people into jobs,\" the prime minister said. </p> <p>\"That's why we chose him as a candidate, to send a different message about what could be achieved for the future.\"</p> <p>Even so, he was forced to defend the HBOS sale after Jim Spowart, the head of the HBOS mortgage subsidiary Intelligent Finance, accused Brown of \"railroading\" it into selling to Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>\"A merger with Lloyds TSB is not the best option,\" Spowart said. \"And, with thousands of jobs in the balance, I implore Mr Brown to think again.\"</p> <p>Salmond toured a local baker's shop with Peter Grant, his candidate, and urged voters to support the SNP to force the government into further concessions on fuel bills and pensioner poverty. </p> <p>\"Gordon Brown put this byelection off for as long as he could, and I think that decision will come back to haunt him, as voters are reminded that Labour have done nothing to help bring energy costs down,\" he said.</p> <p>\"With bills already thudding through the letter boxes, people have had enough and it's time for voters to shock Gordon Brown into action with an SNP demand for cheaper energy bills and a fair deal for Fifers.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/hoc/constituency/0,,-800,00.html\">Click here for a full list of candidates</a>.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday November 4 2008.

  "<p>After Cuba and Brazil, it's only right that Colombia should win recognition as one of the great powerhouses of Latin music. Two new compilations showcase the country's wildly varied styles. From the west coast, there's Pacifico Colombiano: Music Adventures in Afro-Colombia, which is more intriguing than the title would suggest. It's an easygoing set that features the African-influenced music of bands such as Grupo Naidy or Grupo Bahia, who have developed slinky, hypnotic styles based around marimbas, percussion and chanting vocals. Then there's Choc Quib Town, who mix folk themes with hip-hop, and Pacho Pe\u00f1a, whose lilting compositions are based around his trumpet work. </p> <p>The other compilation, Arriba la Cumbia!, is anything but laidback. Cumbia is the insistent, loping style that originated in Cartagena, up on Colombia's Caribbean coast, and is now a global dance craze. This set, compiled by DJ Russ Jones, segues between electronica, including new remixes by the likes of Basement Jaxx, and fine vintage accordion-backed songs from such classic performers as Alberto Pacheco. There are sadly few sleeve notes, but it's a great dance album.</p>",
  "<p>The looming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globalrecession\">global recession</a> will trigger a dramatic shift in the economic balance of power to the emerging world that could see the west lose the dominance it has enjoyed since the dawning of the industrial age, according to one of Britain's leading consultancy firms.</p> <p>Calculations by PricewaterhouseCoopers suggest that the lopsided nature of the downturn means the developed world may have only five years left before it is overtaken by developing countries led by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business+world/china\">China</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business+world/china\">India.</a></p> <p>John Hawksworth, chief economist at PWC, said emerging market economies were likely to be hit much less hard by the global recession than the west, and were on course to account for more than 50% of world GDP by 2013 once the lower cost of living in poorer countries was taken into account.</p> <p>After their rapid growth in the past decade, emerging economies currently account for 43.7% of global output using the purchasing power parity measure of GDP. PWC projects that this will rise to 50.2% within five years. China is expected to grow by 9% a year on average between 2009 and 2013, with India only a little way behind with 8% growth rates. By contrast, the US, the euro area and the UK are projected to grow by just over 2% a year.</p> <p>\"It is striking that such a significant shift in world GDP share from advanced economies to emerging economies could occur within as little as five years, and that from 2013 more than half of world GDP could come from these high growth countries.\"</p> <p>According to the PWC calculations,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/business+world/usa\"> the US would remain the world's biggest economy</a> but its share of global GDP would decline from 21.3% now to 18.8%. </p> <p>China is on course to overtake the euro area as the world's second biggest economy, while India would be challenging Japan for fourth place. On current trends Britain would see its slice of world output drop from 3.3% to 2.9% and be overtaken in the international league table by Russia. Between them the four so-called Brics - Brazil, Russia, India and China - would account for 26.5% of global GDP.</p> <p>\"The Russian projection based on IMF forecasts may now seem somewhat optimistic in the light of events of the last few weeks, but the same could be said of the UK growth projections given the third quarter GDP data released last week\", Hawksworth said.</p> <p>Purchasing power parity is a way of adjusting GDP to take account of the fact that the same good varies in price between countries, with a US dollar buying four or five times as much in China or India as it does in America. </p> <p>PWC said the global share of GDP for emerging economies would be significantly lower using market exchange rates rather than PPPs, although their share would still be rising rapidly.</p>",
  "<p>A bomb goes off in Kabul in the midst of an increasingly bloody conflict in Afghanistan. A seminal US election moves into its closing days. The country \u2013 the world \u2013 sinks deeper into global recession as governments scramble to prevent meltdown. \"Countless\" people flee armed militias in the Congo in what could be the start of a humanitarian catastrophe.</p> <p>And yet the entire news media is fixated by two ego-driven presenters who acted in a deeply unpleasant way towards an innocent grandfather.</p> <p>The Russell Brand/Jonathan Ross affair illuminates much of what is wrong with the news media in Britain \u2013 though not in the way you might expect.</p> <p>It does not show that the BBC is an \"amoral organisation\" or that it is sliding into \"the broadcasting gutter\", as the Daily Mail <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1081662/Mark-Thompson-A-moral-man-amoral-body.html\">has claimed</a>. It does not show that the BBC is producing programmes that \"legitimise negative social behaviour', as the shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/29/bbc-russell-brand\">has suggested</a>. Nor was it either proportionate or sensible to <a href=\"http://www.bigdaddymerk.co.uk/mailwatchnew/\">call Thursday</a> \"A Day of Reckoning\" (also from the Daily Mail) as though there was some sort of Biblical Judgment Day.</p> <p>What it does show is the media fixation with itself. It shows the media obsession with celebrities \u2013 especially celebrities behaving badly. It shows the media's astonishing herd instinct. And it shows the media's inability to distinguish the important from the less important. It demonstrates, in other words, the complete absence of any sense of news values.</p> <p>One would have thought that the events of the last 12 months would have reminded journalists that there are more important things in the world than celebrity misbehaviour. Since Northern Rock was nationalised the economy of the UK and the world has been spiralling towards an abyss. Home repossessions are up by 71%. The banking system teeters on the edge of collapse. Unemployment is rising. And this in the context of incipient environmental devastation.</p> <p>So why, if this is the case, has the story generated so much airtime and column inches? Why has it attracted more than 30,000 complaints and sparked countless comments and debates across the net? (At the time of writing 39,278 comments <a href=\"http://newsforums.bbc.co.uk/nol/thread.jspa?forumID=5560&amp;edition=1&amp;ttl=20081031112127\">have been posted</a> to the BBC's Have Your Say.)</p> <p>Partly because of the newspapers themselves. It should be remembered that immediately following the Brand-Ross broadcast itself, on October 18, there were only two complaints. There was no mention of it in the Sunday Times on the October 19, though there was <a href=\"http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/celebrity/article4967589.ece\">a piece by Jonathan Ross himself</a>, \"Fame and how to survive it\", which now has a ring of irony (not least in Ross's comment: \"Radio helped me get my foot back in the door. It was while I was at Virgin with Chris [Evans], who encouraged me to do more or less what I wanted, that I really learnt to trust my own judgment about what works and what doesn't\"). Nor was the broadcast mentioned in <a href=\"http://blogs.independent.co.uk/independent/2008/10/jonathan-ross-h.html\">a blog on the Independent's website</a> on October 21, which revealed that Ross's \"first sexual experience was with a vacuum cleaner\".</p> <p>It was only when the story appeared in the Mail on Sunday, more than a week after the broadcast, that complaints began to escalate.</p> <p>It has also generated public interest because it was a nasty and unpleasant thing to do. Most of us have, at some stage in our lives, been bullied, and this certainly qualifies as bullying. Not only that, but bullying of someone who is, reputedly, distinguished by his gentle courtesy and good humour.</p> <p>Nasty and unpleasant as it was, though, does it deserve the coverage it has received? No, it does not. Nastiness and bullying by celebrities should be exposed but should not obscure coverage of the bloodletting in Afghanistan, Iraq or the Congo. Neither should it overshadow coverage of the government's decisions on interest rates, or on student grants, or on the profits of oil companies, from the press.</p> <p>Brand and Ross's actions should be examined and each of them dealt with accordingly by the BBC. The presenters and corporation should apologise to Mr Sachs. Then we can move on.</p> <p>Yet the newspapers have not moved on. They have revelled in the BBC's discomfort. They have delighted in the statements by political party leaders, in the populist comments from Jack Straw and Jeremy Hunt, and in the thundering from commentators like <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1081654/STEPHEN-GLOVER-How-man-high-morals-preside-BBCs-descent-gutter.html\">Stephen Glover</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1081388/PIERS-MORGAN-Brand-just-sex-obsessed-ex-junkie--Its-Ross-BBC-sack-today.html\">Piers Morgan</a> (paragon of virtue he). It should be noted that the politicians' voices were notably silent after the newspapers were indicted for their behaviour towards the McCanns, Robert Murat, and the so-called Tapas Seven.</p> <p>The papers have not moved on because it is in their self-interest to drum up this issue. The press are angry at the BBC \u2013 not for its moral stance, but for the fact that it has a guaranteed income while they watch their revenues fall. They are angry that it is competing with them online, and may extend that competition to local news.</p> <p>But most importantly the papers have not moved on because they know this is news that interests the public \u2013 as opposed to news in the public interest. Though the two have always been blurred they now appear to be indistinguishable. Broadsheet and tabloid, television and internet \u2013 almost no UK national news medium seems able to make a distinction between the two. As a result we find our media raging against an incident most of us never heard or saw, that has no direct bearing on our lives, by two people we don't know.</p>",

Now it is in liquidation and 7,000 former employees are in shock. </p> <p>\"One day we went to work as usual, the next it was all closed,\" said Wei Sunying, gazing through the barred gate of the factory in Dongguan in southern <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/business+world/china\">China </a>where she spent eight years painting plastic components in a fume-filled room.</p> <p>\"Thousands of us are looking for jobs now. We walk around every day till our feet ache but we can't find anything.\"</p> <p>Few in the west have heard of Dongguan, but the chances are that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/manufacturing\">your shoes, your TV or your children's toys</a> originated here. Exports have built a city of up to 14 million inhabitants \u2014 twice the population of Greater London \u2014 almost all migrant workers from the countryside. Its economy has grown 15% annually in recent years. </p> <p>Now the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketturmoil\">global financial and economic crisis </a>is proving the final straw for exporters already punished by rising costs and a stronger currency. </p> <p>In the last year, chill winds have blown through the baking Pearl River Delta. Sixty-seven thousand small and medium-sized businesses in China collapsed in the first half of 2008, many in these manufacturing heartlands, says the national economic planning body. Toy firms have been particularly badly hit, thanks to safety scares and product recalls. Textile firms, with wafer-thin margins, are also reeling. </p> <p>Next came tighter credit for many foreign-owned firms, such as Hong Kong's Smart Union. And then, in the last two months, a sharp drop in US and European demand as consumers reined in spending. </p> <p>A local trade association predicts that by the end of January, Dongguan and its neighbours Shenzhen and Guangzhou will lose 9,000 of their 45,000 factories. </p> <p>\"Many factories are looking at completely empty order books,\" warned Stephen Green, head of China research at Standard Chartered, who believes the export sector will be stagnant and could even shrink next year.</p> <p>Green predicts that China will grow 7.9% next year \u2014 well below the double-digit figures enjoyed over the last half decade \u2014 while others suggest it could fall closer to 7%.</p> <p>That sounds enviable to western countries facing recession. But with the working age population still growing, China needs at least 8% growth to maintain the current employment rate. And the fall-out will be highly concentrated in provinces such as Guangdong.</p> <p>\"The social impact of this is going to be huge. The problems are getting bigger and bigger,\" said Wooyeal Paik, who is researching Dongguan's industry and migrant workforce at the University of California at Los Angeles.</p> <p>\"Impromptu protests by disgruntled workers left jobless and without pay are becoming more common; they have resorted to petitioning local officials for backpay because they have few other ways to remonstrate and be compensated.</p> <p>\"They will complain more and they will go to local government offices more... You will see demonstrations and picketing. And probably there's a risk of violence against bosses \u2014 especially foreigners.\"</p> <p>Dongguan's government stepped in to reimburse the Smart Union workers to the tune of 24,000 yuan (\u00a32.2m) after thousands gathered at the factory gates and outside local authority offices.</p> <p>But two months' back pay \u2014 1200 yuan for most \u2014 will not last long. There is no redundancy package and a lawsuit by workers appears to have limited prospects of success.</p> <p>Wei, from Guizhou, is one of many struggling to find new work. Even if she could read the job adverts, most ask for recruits under 35; she is just over 40. </p> <p>\"I came here as a migrant worker because my children need money for schooling,\" she said. </p> <p>\"Now I can't support my children. I don't even have enough money to get back home and it's expensive to stay here.\"</p> <p>Even job offers aren't always what they seem, said 26-year-old Fang Jianlin, whose friends were recently conned. </p> <p>\"Recruiters told them the conditions and the salaries were very good, but on the way to the place they were asked for money. They got robbed; some were even beaten,\" he said.</p> <p>Smart Union was such a popular employer that Fang paid a hefty \"introduction fee\" to win his job there. At worst, he and his wife would earn around 600 yuan a month; at the busiest times, when production ran until 2am, they could take home 2,100 yuan each. </p> <p>But he and his wife will return to his village in Sichuan in a few days, where his parents are rearing their children, unless new work turns up. They are not sure how they will support the family, but cannot afford the 50 yuan a day in rent, food and transport to stay here.</p> <p>It's a sobering end to the dream which lures millions of workers to Dongguan each year, where they struggle and study their way towards the promise of a regular income; perhaps even a place in the burgeoning middle classes. At the city's night schools, thousands of workers end their long days with classes on everything from car maintenance to law.</p> <p>Bob Li is one of the area's success stories. He arrived in 1995 as a casual labourer. \"Everyone in my hometown had heard Guangdong was covered in gold,\" he said.</p> <p>Now he manages a factory for Richall, which supplies durable bags to companies such as Walmart, Carlsberg and Disney. Twenty-five thousand totes for Tesco are stacked up awaiting delivery.</p> <p>But he is unnerved by the economic downturn.</p> <p>\"These days it is getting more and more difficult for factories like us,\" he said, citing the cost of wages and materials. </p> <p>\"The exchange rate is already a huge issue here; people are losing interest. The price of our materials has risen because they're made from oil... Taken together, costs have risen by 30%-40%.\"</p> <p>To some extent, Dongguan has become a victim of its own success. The rising prosperity of the region has created inflationary pressures. Workers want higher wages; new labour laws are designed to wipe out sweatshops but bring higher costs, which squeeze many companies. </p> <p>Manufacturers have already fled inland to cheaper provinces, in many cases encouraged by Guangdong authorities, who hoped to move the province up the value chain \u2014 condensing 200 years of western industrial history into fewer than 15. </p> <p>\"We have a policy to empty the cage for the new birds,\" Guangdong's vice-governor, Wan Qingliang, told reporters this month. </p> <p>\"The ultimate target is to build the Pearl River Delta into the core region of modern manufacturing.\"</p> <p>Others are unsure of the wisdom of the policy in the face of a worldwide downturn.</p> <p>\"Places like Guangdong miscalculated the development of the economy. They actually tried to push those labour intensive and small and medium sized enterprises out of the [established industrial] area because they wanted hi-tech industries there. But when something bad happens, like the economic downturn, what are they going to do?\" said Paik. </p> <p>He acknowledges that numerous East Asian economies, such as Japan, have moved up the value chain in just the same way; and that the Chinese government deserves to be confident, given its economic record.</p> <p>\"But they haven't experienced a serious economic downturn except right after 1989 and have been overconfident in their policy of the quick transformation of industrial structure toward hi-tech in Guangdong,\" he cautioned.</p> <p>The risk is that officials push the city off the economic ladder rather than up it. Whether new subsidies, export tax rebates and other support for small businesses can save them remains to be seen.</p> <p>Yet China's rising living standards in the 30 years since economic reforms were launched has left most people optimistic about its long-term prospects. Migrant workers returning home think they may come back in a few years. A security guard at the shuttered Smart Union plant is plotting out his course to university. </p> <p>\"If we compare the situation to when I first arrived, I have already found my pot of gold,\" said Li, the factory manager.</p> <p>\"But I can still see it's just the beginning.\"</p> <p><em>Additional research by Chen Shi</em></p>",
  "<p>University research management is a fast moving profession \u2013 and one that a lot of managers are keen to move out of, tired of being \"treated as second-class citizens\".<br> A global survey by the Association of Commonwealth Universities reveals that 80% had been in their current position for fewer than five years and nearly 60% felt their next job would be outside research management (around half if those retiring are excluded). This ranges from 67% of Australasian respondents to 45% in Europe.</p> <p>Reasons for leaving can be financial. \"The skills developed as a research manager are extremely transferable and the pay for using those skills in the private sector would be higher,\" said one European respondent.</p> <p>But the survey also uncovered a great deal of frustration and discontent at stress levels in an increasingly complex job. An Australasian respondent put it bluntly: \"Workload too heavy, management and conditions too stressful; poor-little training available; understaffed; poor/inadequate systems; change without thought or planning; staff not acknowledged or respected; senior management lack training and skills in people/systems management.\" <br> \"Lack of advancement and progressive opportunities and career growth,\" complained one from North America.  Another research manager commented from Australia: \"Good research administrators are hard to come by, yet despite this fact the good ones are often treated like second-class citizens by senior management within their own units, which is a great shame. </p> <p>\"The workloads can be horrific, especially during major grant submission periods. This causes a lot of them to burn out and leave the profession. There is definitely not enough recognition or appreciation of the effort that goes into research administration roles in Australian universities.\" </p> <p>Almost 400 research management staff in 24 countries around the world were surveyed, largely online. Around half of the 127 respondents who gave reasons for leaving the profession referred to issues common to any profession - a change of interests, personal and family related issues.</p> <p>However, among the remaining reasons, there were some striking patterns. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Out of 22 who very specifically referred to the lack of career progression in research management as the main reason they would leave, 15 were from the UK. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Of 26 respondents frustrated with the way research management was organised at their institution, saying it was under-resourced in an increasingly complex environment, resulting in high stress levels, 15 were from Australia. Another significant minority response was 12 people who referred specifically to the lack of financial reward. </p> <p>Overall, survey findings suggest that the profession is rapidly expanding and is fluid with significant numbers moving both into and out of the profession. It seems that an increasing demand for the research management function is not being matched by institutional structures, resulting in under-resourcing, lack of adequate training and paucity of promotion and career prospects. Institutions will need to address these issues in order to retain skilled staff to perform these increasingly important roles.</p> <p>The survey reveals a highly skilled profession demanding both diverse and highly specialised knowledge and aptitudes - 94% of respondents were graduates; 65% were educated at postgraduate level; 34% had doctoral qualifications. PhD's and post-doctoral qualifications were most common amongst African respondents with around 70% holding these (as opposed to around 25% in other regions).</p> <p>Despite this high level of qualification, around 60% of respondents felt they had unmet training needs, mostly because appropriate courses were not available and they did not have time to undertake training, and that their institutions needed to increase expertise in all areas from legal and marketing issues to innovation and technology transfer. </p> <p>Furthermore, the \"increasing demands of funders\", \"the need to deal effectively with an increasing range of international partners\" and \"the increasing complexity of contracts and legal and ethical issues\" are seen as some of the most significant challenges facing the profession. </p> <p>These and other areas of the survey suggest that the role is becoming increasingly complex while institutional structures to appropriately train, evaluate and reward professionals lag behind. </p> <p>The importance for universities of managing their research outputs can not be overstated. At a strategic level, institutions are not only under increasing pressure to respond to the demands of society by producing - and transferring - more knowledge that is useful to their communities, but also to diversify their sources of funding while conforming to increased demands for excellence and relevance from research funders. </p> <p>Researchers need to be made aware of funding opportunities, proposals need to be written and costed, contracts need to be negotiated and monitored, IP rights need to be resolved, and so on. Out of these needs has emerged a distinct profession of research managers and administrators with specialised skills who play an essential role in the research function of universities.</p> <p>A full report of the survey's findings is due early next year.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Julie Stackhouse is senior programme officer (research) at the Association of Commonwealth Universities</p>",

  "<p>Twenty years ago this weekend, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/nirvana\">Nirvana</a> released <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3limq8huF80\">Love Buzz</a>, the first single by the band who would ignite grunge from an interesting local scene to a global phenomenon.</p> <p>And this is significant why? Because grunge wasn't just another musical or youth trend - it was the ultimate expression and fusion of most of the defining cultural, ideological and social threads of the modern western world. Feminism, liberalism, irony, apathy, cynicism/idealism (those opposite sides of one frustrated coin), anti-authoritarianism, wry post-modernism, and not least a love of dirty, abrasive music; grunge reconciled all these into a seminal whole.</p> <p>For Generation X-ers, male grungers represented all that is good in men. They were the fabled \"New Man\" with the volume turned up to 10, gentle-natured but discordant and angry. The women were intelligent, non-conformist, cool. Each took the best aspects of their opposite gender and retained the best of their own. Grunge took back loud music from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TjPbeyHIO0\">poodle-rock</a> and gave it a heart, soul and brain. It married a love of noise with thoughtfulness and sensitivity, putting a trash soundtrack to lofty principles and uncommon erudition. It turned old paradigms on their head, like the one that said rock music was made by \"real men\" and feminism was for ball-busting harpies and emasculated weirdoes.</p> <p>Grunge wasn't nihilist or moany - they really did want a better world for everyone. It was misrepresented as being self-absorbed, but actually addressed big themes, things outside the artists' private concerns - a rare thing in popular music.</p> <p>These bands weren't restricted by the limits and ideologies of genres like punk, which insist that you write certain kinds of music and lyrics. They didn't recycle banal cliches but tackled weighty subjects - one could almost describe Soundgarden, for instance, as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiSkyEyBczU\">existential</a>.</p> <p>So Pearl Jam wrote about domestic abuse, illiteracy, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAWoQUrKrbE&amp;feature=related\">the maltreatment of the mentally ill</a>. Nirvana looked at alienation, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jup5G0meTm4\">rape</a>, stultifying conformity. Alice in Chains dug deeply into the black hole of addiction. Soundgarden pondered the search for meaning in an indifferent universe. Courtney Love wrote ferocious lyrics about misogyny, eating disorders, sexual predators.</p> <p>Aesthetically, they eschewed babes, booze and fast cars for cropped hair, college degrees and ever-present frowns. And they lived out their principles in concrete, courageous ways.</p> <p>Most grunge bands were politically active. Lollapalooza combined music with information stalls on everything from organic food to voter registration. Pearl Jam fought a ruinous battle with Ticketmaster and refused to make promos; Nirvana constantly antagonised their new, macho audience.</p> <p>It was a long way from Axl Rose thrusting his crotch in your face on MTV, and of course it couldn't last. Grunge was replaced by frat-boy rock, pimp-wannabe gangsta rappers and hyper-sexualised Britney/Barbie dolls. Plus \u00e7a change ...</p> <p>For my generation, grunge was more than just music: it was subterfuge, knowledge, philosophy, empathy, wit, courage, love, desire and anger, and it saddens me that nothing has truly replaced it. Sure, there will always be musicians who are politically aware, socially concerned, risk-taking; not everyone is Fred Durst. But the days when gender constructs became virtually meaningless, when brains and coolness and sex appeal weren't incompatible, when mass popular culture transcended humble origins to become something profound, subversive and greater than itself \u2026 those days are gone. They're in the grave with Kurt Cobain, Layne Staley and Kristen Pfaff.</p>",

  "<p>It comes as no surprise that the European Commission is relaxed about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2008/oct/28/mandelson-georgeosborne\">Peter Mandelson's meetings</a> with the aluminium magnate, Oleg Deripaska, at a time when the trade commissioner was party to discussions that would affect the business of the Russian.</p> <p>Brussels has long had a reputation as being unaccountable to public opinion. Despite the commission's attempts to open up EU decision-making to greater public scrutiny \u2013 through its <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/eti/index_en.htm\">European Transparency Initiative</a> \u2013 secrecy remains the modus operandi. The system governing the behaviour of officials allows for widespread conflicts of interest. Parliamentary rules for MEPs have been described by one British MEP as a \"scandal waiting to happen\".</p> <p>Numerous cases have been documented of apparent conflicts of interests involving MEPs. Giles Chichester <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/05/conservatives.eu\">hit the headlines</a> this summer after breaking the rules on MEP's expenses and was forced to resign as chairman of the Conservative party in Brussels. However, little has been made of his problematic ties to the nuclear industry. He is president of a pro-nuclear industry lobby group known in Brussels as \"The submarine of the energy industry\". Until recently, he also held the key position of chair of the EU parliamentary committee with responsibility for nuclear issues, including nuclear safety, decommissioning and nuclear waste disposal.</p> <p>Another example is Scottish Conservative MEP, John Purvis, who has a financial stake in a firm that invests in the biotechnology sector. At the same time he has been seen as a leading advocate for biotech in the European parliament. Another Brit, Caroline Jackson MEP, sits on the parliament's environment committee and drafted a report on the EU's waste framework directive while at the same time being a paid advisor to private waste company, <a href=\"http://www.shanks.co.uk/shanks/\">Shanks</a>.</p> <p>Jackson is one of five EU officials nominated for a <a href=\"http://www.worstlobby.eu/2008/\">\"Worst Lobby Award\"</a>, an initiative organised by a coalition of civil society groups pushing for greater transparency in Brussels. Among the corporate interests up for an award is the <a href=\"http://www.iata.org/index.htm\">International Air Transport Association</a> for its deceptive lobbying campaign to avoid CO2 reduction obligations in the aviation sector. Also nominated is <a href=\"http://www.eaasm.eu/\">The European Alliance for Access to Safe Medicines</a> for hiding the involvement of the big pharmaceutical companies in their campaigns.</p> <p>The awards spotlight just a few of the thousands of mainly commercial organisations that seek to influence EU policy. In Brussels, as in Britain, lobbyists operate in an almost entirely unregulated environment. In June the European Commission attempted to increase transparency in the industry by introducing a register of lobbyists. Registration, however, is voluntary and as few as 10% of the thousands of commercial lobbying firms that peddle influence and access in Brussels have so far chosen to sign on to it.</p> <p>Thanks to the recent insight into the affairs of the rich and powerful, we should be under no illusion in Britain that undue influence is also being exerted on our policy-makers. Our lobbying industry, which today includes law and accountancy firms, management consultancies, think tanks, charities and others, has grown to be worth an estimated \u00a31.9bn. It is embedded in our political system, and, as in Brussels, it operates away from the public gaze.</p> <p>Under the radar of most journalists, a parliamentary inquiry has been taking place into the normally opaque world of lobbying. Throughout the last 12 months, the influential <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee.cfm\">public administration select committee</a>, chaired by Tony Wright MP, has taken evidence on whether certain interests are being afforded privileged access to, and undue influence over, our decision makers. It has also sought to find out what effect this is having on public trust in politics.</p> <p>The recommendations the select committee will make in the next few weeks are key. If it finds, much as the British public suspects, that there is an enormous disparity in access and influence in our political system, it should recommend action: that the government introduce a mandatory register of lobbyists. This is the first step in opening up the opaque world of lobbying to public scrutiny. The effect will be to increase the accountability of government to the people they serve. Something that the majority of the British public has long ceased to expect but should now demand.</p> <p>The Mandelson-Deripaska affair gives us a rare insight into the relationship between politics and the wealthy elite. A register of lobbyists would guarantee that information on those who seek to influence our politicians is systematically put into the public domain.</p>",
  "<p>As the credit crunch continues, commentators have resorted to simple images to capture its impact. For some, it is empty office buildings; for others, a plague of \"for sale\" signs or bankers in despair.</p> <p>For me, it is the disappearance of cranes from the skyline. At London School of Economics we have just invested \u00a371m in a new academic building. It will be opened by the Queen on bonfire day \u2013 and we are planning our own party and fireworks.</p> <p>But our sense of excitement is tempered by the view from our new roof garden. The cranes that decorated the skyline to the east, often adorned at this time of year with cheery lights to welcome Christmas, are either idle or disappearing.</p> <p>The new builds in the City - once such a vibrant area, not just in terms of investment and jobs, but also in terms of creativity - are stalled.</p> <p>And with them, construction jobs. Job cuts in house building alone are predicted to reach 35,000 in the next two years. Apprentices are now an optimistic after-thought. The word sustainability \u2013 on everyone's lips in for the past two years \u2013 is being replaced by survival. Many of the builders who packed up their tools and left the London School of Economics last month will not find new work.</p> <p>This leaves estates managers at universities with a huge responsibility. The old Keynsian adage that public sector investment can counter a recession still holds sway, particularly in the university sector. We are truly counter-cyclical. In times of recession many flock to higher education to build up their skills in anticipation of an economic revival. Consequently, universities may well find themselves one of the few players with money to invest in construction. Indeed, the Higher Education Funding Council for England, which has invested billions over the last 10 years, has committed a further \u00a32.5bn by 2011.<br> Now is the time for universities to be bold in their development plans and strategic acquisitions. Property will be cheaper to purchase and top architects and designers will be only too pleased to enter design competitions for new buildings, and contractors will be falling over themselves to get on tender lists. With construction costs predicted to fall over the next year and consultants' fees becoming more competitive, universities will be able to get a lot more bang for their buck. The question is, which sort of bang?</p> <p>We must ensure that our buildings are environmentally friendly, that they set new standards in architectural design that inspire and welcome students, and that they come in on time and on budget.</p> <p>Universities need to work harder to achieve higher environmental standards. At LSE our new building is a refurbishment. While many continue to be wary of refurbishments as the cost can be up to 80% of a new build, they often have significant environmental advantages. I believe we are the first university to achieve a BREEAM Excellent award for a refurbished building. Others, such as Lancaster University, have won BREEAM awards for new student residences. However, universities could and should do more and I understand that the funding council will be strongly encouraging universities in this direction.</p> <p>Our role as inspirational leaders is also debatable. The last 10 years may well be looked upon as a golden age in terms of capital investment in universities. University leaders do not like to say this too loudly, but this government has been generous in terms of capital. And while there will be debates over the success of the private finance initiative, there will also be debates over the use of this money by universities. In terms of creating a lasting legacy of high quality inspirational architecture many of the buildings put up in the last 10 years will not pass the test of time \u2013 the majority are prosaic and some look outdated already.</p> <p>And just to ensure that I do escape the wrath of my fellow estates managers, I would like to point to those that have been inspirational. The Libeskind building at London Metropolitan University, the Ruskin library at Lancaster and the Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication are all noted examples.</p> <p>But it has to be of concern that in the annual list of clients favoured by architects, university estates managers barely get a mention. Why is this? At LSE we used the prize-winning architects Grimshaw to design our new building. And we adopted a \"design and build\" construction method which means that you can use top architects, manage risk and deliver a high quality building on time and on budget.</p> <p>Three years ago a survey by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment looked at the value of good building design in higher education. They found that 60% of students and staff believe the quality of the building design had a positive impact on their choice of university, more then 70% cent believed that a well-designed building improved the way they felt and worked.</p> <p>As we enter what looks as if it could be a marked period of recession, universities owe it to staff and students to ensure that their estates strategies are inspirational \u2013 and truly sustainable. Even if the only cranes on the horizon are those belonging to fellow universities, they will be a welcome sight.</p>",
  "<p>Mercury Morris has been keeping tabs on the situation for some time. \"I'll be watching the Tennessee Titans, and I hope to see them go unbeaten,\" insisted Morris, the most outspoken member of the 1972 Miami Dolphins, to the Nashville City Paper on October 16. Two weeks later, Morris is no longer the only member of that Dolphins team - the only side since the 1970 merger to complete a season undefeated - taking phone calls.</p> <p>\"I don't think they're that good. I'm not really concerned,\" opined Morris's former team-mate Jim Kiick after the Titans' <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter?game_id=29643&amp;displayPage=tab_gamecenter&amp;season=2008&amp;week=\" reg8\"\" title=\"\">31-21 win over the Indianapolis Colts</a> on Monday night. \"There's no need to pay attention,\" chipped in former Dolphins defensive end Manny Fernandez. \"I can't even tell you what the name of their quarterback is.\"</p> <p>Such questions roll around every year, of course, and there is a certain predictability to the way this story unfolds. At least one team usually reaches late October with a perfect record, and as they do the 1972 Dolphins are trotted out to dismiss their hopes of maintaining the record the rest of the way. When said team eventually does fall short, the Fins are said to get together for a glass of champagne, though this aspect of the story is also <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/sports/football/miami72.asp\" title=\"\">periodically denied</a>.</p> <p>Last year, of course, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/feb/04/ussport1\" title=\"\">the Patriots came within one late drive</a> of <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=\" jfhttxv3u1a\"\" title=\"\">joining the '72 Dolphins in Perfectville</a>, but it is hard to imagine the Titans getting anything like that far. By this point last season the Patriots were well on their way to breaking a host of league records and were winning by an average of 25.5 points per game. Their smallest margin of victory through eight weeks was 17 points, but the Titans have only won by an average of 13.3 and beat the Baltimore Ravens in week five by a single field goal.</p> <p>But last year's Patriots would be the first to acknowledge that titles mean more than records, and if the adage about defence winning championships holds, then the Titans are in great shape for a run at Super Bowl XLIII. The Titans have given up fewer points than any other team in the league - 87 at a rate of 12.4 points per game - and along with the Chicago Bears lead the league with 16 turnovers.</p> <p>Furthermore, while the Titans may not be spectacular on offence, their running game is one of the most effective in the league. Jet-heeled 200lb rookie Chris Johnson and 235lb third-year bulldozer LenDale White complement one another perfectly in the backfield, and the 14 rushing touchdowns they have produced between them is more than any other team in the league. Johnson may well find himself picking up rookie-of-the-year honours come the end of the season if he can maintain his current 5.1 yards-per-carry average.</p> <p>Indeed, the Titans' only obvious weak link is their passing attack, which is yet to produce more than 200 yards in any game this season. No team has posted such numbers yet still opened with seven wins since the 1985 Los Angeles Rams, and for all the strength of both the running game and defence, there is lingering concern over how the Titans will respond should an opponent ever succeed in breaking a couple of big plays against them and jump out to a two- or three-score lead. On Monday they were able to chip away at the Colts' lead after falling 14-6 behind, but were they to find themselves in a similar situation late in a game, it is hard to imagine how they would respond.</p> <p>Which is ironic, because Kerry Collins, the quarterback Fernandez couldn't name, has in many ways done a superb job since stepping in when Vince Young sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee late in their season opener against Jacksonville. Tennessean writer David Climer even argued on Wednesday that head coach Jeff Fisher's subsequent decision to name Collins as the full-time starter \"may go down as the best call of Fisher's coaching career\".</p> <p>Fisher's move may have been prompted as much by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/12/ussport\" title=\"\">concern over the mental state of Young</a>, described as \"extremely depressed\" by a team psychologist last month, as anything else, but either way it was the right decision. Collins may be a 14-year veteran with a mediocre career passer rating of 73.4, but he is also old and wise enough after so long in the league to do what Young at times couldn't - manage games effectively, and put the team in position to win.</p> <p>Collins may have only thrown for three touchdowns in six starts, but he has also thrown just three interceptions. Young had two in the first game alone and last year threw 19 in 15 games. It may be a cliche, but when the rest of the team is as talented as that in Tennessee right now, the quarterback really doesn't often need to win games - only to avoid losing them. His experience was all the more valuable on Monday as the Colts surprised their hosts with a four-defensive-lineman, four-linebacker package that initially contained the Titans offence.</p> <p>Fans are eager to see Young back in the game and some have called for Fisher to experiment with two-quarterback formations that could take advantage of his athletic ability - as the <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d5d80bf2cd7&amp;filter=cant-miss-plays&amp;categoryId=\" featured\"\" title=\"\">Baltimore Ravens did so effectively against Oakland</a>. His reluctance to do so is understandable. While Collins does offer the best opportunity to win now, Young remains the future of this franchise, and given his existing track record with injuries, sending him out to run reverses and catch passes could easily backfire.</p> <p>Besides, the Titans hardly need to lean on gimmicks right now. By beating the Colts, they established a four-game lead over everyone in the NFC South and a two-game lead over every other team in the AFC. If the passing game's limitations make perfection unlikely, homefield advantage throughout the playoffs is a more realistic and important target. The evidence to date would suggest that much can be achieved without the need to install any added wrinkles.</p> <p>The Titans are entering a trickier part of their schedule, with a home game against Green Bay followed by trips to Chicago and Jacksonville. The omens for this weekend's game against the Packers aren't all encouraging - Green Bay are coming off a bye week in which both Pro Bowl cornerback Al Harris and safety Atari Bigby appear to have regained fitness, while the Titans' preparation time has been cut down by playing on Monday night. Tennessee have lost their last four games coming off a short week - including a 35-6 defeat in Cincinnati last season.</p> <p>On the other hand, the Titans had never started a season 7-0 before either, and Green Bay's run defence is currently ranked 25th in the league. If they can avoid falling behind early, Johnson and White could have a field day. Those '72 Dolphins may yet have a few more phone calls to deal with.</p> <h2>Payton's complaint</h2> <p>New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton was less than enthusiastic about his experiences in London after returning to the States. As well as criticising the transport arrangements, he said that the pitch at Wembley was \"real poor\", and looking over the footage of the game, you can see that the linemen in particular were getting bogged down and struggling to explode out of their stances.</p> <p>Payton's comments shouldn't be blown out of proportion - he seemed grumpy about the trip from the moment he set foot in London and I still suspect his greatest grievance came from being forced to give up a home game, even though his team went on to win. Nevertheless if the turf is a problem it should be looked at. Neither Twickenham nor the Millennium Stadium can hold as many fans as Wembley, but if players and coaches feel either one offers a better surface, that is something the NFL may need to take into consideration.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown's plans to \"spend his way out of recession\" risk deepening the downturn and saddling future generations of Britons with massive tax hikes, George Osborne warned today. </p> <p>The shadow chancellor sought to draw battle lines on the economy as the latest opinion poll showed the Tory lead narrowing to single figures as Brown prospers from his handling of the financial crisis.</p> <p>In a speech at the London School of Economics, Osborne accused the prime minister of abandoning the rhetoric of economic prudence in favour of the \"failed and discredited\" Keynesian demand-management techniques that led to soaring inflation in the 1970s. </p> <p>The government's plan to borrow more to pay for a state \"spending splurge\" was \"a cruise missile aimed at the heart of the economy\", which would force taxes up in the long term by the equivalent of 4p on income tax, the shadow chancellor claimed.</p> <p>In his first speech since he acknowledged making mistakes over his contacts with Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, Osborne sought to put the \"yachtgate\" row behind him and return to the offensive on the economy. </p> <p>Osborne said voters now had a clear choice between future Labour tax hikes to repay a huge national debt, or a Tory \"responsible road to recovery\", which would eventually bring down levies. </p> <p>The prime minister and his chancellor, Alistair Darling, have insisted that they will allow government debt to rise and spend in a bid to keep the economy on track. </p> <p>Osborne used his half-hour speech to frame this approach as the \"weak, irresponsible choice\" that he said would make it more difficult for the Bank of England to achieve a \"sustained reduction in interest rates\". </p> <p>\"It saddles this generation and the next with a burden of debt that could take a decade or more to pay off,\" said the shadow chancellor. </p> <p>\"It means you end up spending more on paying debt interest than defending your country or educating your children. It means damaging tax rises at the very moment when you want to be reducing taxes to help the recovery.\" </p> <p>And he added: \"Gordon Brown's talk of a spending splurge tries to give the impression of activity and action, when in fact it is the road to economic ruin. It may even involve another 10p-style tax con, but under Gordon Brown everyone knows we will have higher taxes for many, many years to come.\" </p> <p>Increasing borrowing to boost state spending by just 1% of GDP would mean future tax hikes equivalent to 4p on income tax, said Osborne. </p> <p>\"That is not just a tax bombshell, it is a cruise missile aimed at the heart of the economy and in extremis that can mean we lose the confidence of international markets,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The prime minister's desire to spend his way out of recession will not only make the recession worse, it will undermine the recovery too.\" </p> <p>The shadow chancellor promised that a Tory government would \"stick to fiscal responsibility\", while interest rate cuts and measures such as freezing council tax \"get money in people's pockets\". </p> <p>\"By ensuring that we don't borrow without limits in a recession, we will open the way to lower taxes in the recovery,\" he said. </p> <p>\"So there's the choice in British politics: irresponsible borrowing now and higher taxes later under Labour, or the responsible Conservative plan. Let the Bank of England cut interest rates now and lay the ground for lower taxes later.\" </p> <p>He professed to be confused by the government's view on the best way to restore the economy. \"It is not very clear what their position actually is,\" said Osborne.</p> <p>Yet the government's handling of the economic downturn has played well with voters, according to a YouGov poll for the Daily Telegraph, which found that Labour was more trusted to look after the interests of \"ordinary people\" during the economic crisis by a margin of 33% to 28%. </p> <p>Brown was also ahead when people were asked which leader would navigate better through the current financial problems - although only by a single point.</p> <p>Overall the Tories were on 42%, down three points since October 4, while Labour was up two points on 33%. The Lib Dems' figure was unchanged at 15%.</p> <p>The survey showed the Conservative lead has plunged from 24 points to nine points over five months.</p> <p>Angela Eagle, the Labour Treasury minister, accused the shadow chancellor of \"confusion\" about Tory economic policy. </p> <p>Eagle said: \"George Osborne has again shown today that the Tories do not have a coherent answer to the global financial turmoil. </p> <p>\"The Tories remain totally confused on borrowing: first calling for borrowing to fall, then they said it was right to rise, now he says he wants a limit but cannot say what that limit would be. </p> <p>\"Only two weeks ago, Osborne pledged not to interfere in the Bank of England's independence in setting interest rates, now he's calling for a cut. </p> <p>\"And today, while Labour is reducing taxes by \u00a3120 for 22 million basic rate tax-payers and freezing fuel duty, George Osborne is the one who is proposing an immediate 5p per litre increase in fuel duty - a damaging tax rise at a difficult time for families and small businesses.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats accused the shadow chancellor of being \"way out of his depth\". Vincent Cable, their Treasury spokesman, said: \"His arguments on how to get us out of recession are entirely incoherent. He argues against continuing government spending on the basis that it will push up borrowing, then announces unfunded tax cuts which would do just that.</p> <p>\"Throughout the economic crisis George Osborne has consistently shown poor judgement, from opposing the nationalisation of Northern Rock to advocating continued short-selling and supporting further deregulation of the City.</p> <p>\"After weeks of waiting for the Tories to give a hint of their economic proposals, this speech is a damp squib.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis\">John Lewis</a> suffered a 9.8% fall in sales at its department stores last week compared with a year ago, and warned of a \"testing Christmas\" as the economic downturn gathers pace.</p> <p>The earlier timing of last year's school half-term may have affected the figure to last Saturday, but John Lewis said it was clear that customers were being \"far more judicious\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/retail\">in their spending in the face of recession</a>.</p> <p>Singer analyst Matthew McEachran said the figures implied sales declines in the \"high teens\" on a same-store basis. Sales at the group's upmarket food chain, Waitrose, edged up 0.6% in the week to October 25, a figure which he said implied a like-for-like decline.</p> <p>All categories were down at John Lewis department stores, in particular sales of items for the home, which fell 17.3%, and electrical goods, down 9.6%. Fashion sales dropped by 1.3%.</p> <p>Northern stores outperformed the south, where Milton Keynes, Cribbs Causeway near Bristol, Southampton and Watford suffered sales falls of more than 20%. Growth at the John Lewis website slowed to 7.8% from 24%.</p> <p>\"The third quarter of the year ended on a subdued note, coinciding as it did with confirmation that the UK economy shrank during this period,\" said Andy Street, John Lewis's managing director. \"The effect can clearly be seen in our trade \u2013 with a distinct softening since the summer.\"</p> <p>With 55 days to go until Christmas, Street said: \"For sure, it is going to be a testing Christmas, but our readiness is second to none.\" </p> <p>Retail analyst Freddie George at Seymour Pierce said John Lewis would have been affected by the timing of half term and discounting at a number of competitors, including Debenhams, House of Fraser and Bhs. \"We understand that sales have strongly recovered in the current week,\" he said.</p> <p>However, George has slashed his profit estimates for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/31/marksspencer-retail\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a> and today, Ted Baker, \"predominantly because we are concerned about the medium-term outlook, the impact of the downturn on high spending urban shoppers and an increase in the level of discount activity\". He warned that next year would be even bleaker for retailers.</p> <p>Given that John Lewis department store sales are seen as a bellwether for the health of consumer spending, Howard Archer at Global Insight described the plunge in last week's sales as \"extremely worrying\". \"This heightens fears that the economy will suffer from an extended period of serious consumer retrenchment. This is particularly bad news for retailers as the vital Christmas period gets under way,\" he said. </p> <p>Blacks Leisure, the struggling outdoor retailer, today reported half-year losses widened by 55% to \u00a36.7m, but insisted it was making good progress on its turnaround plan. The company, which has 428 stores selling camping equipment and outdoor clothing, said sales dropped by 9.4% over the six months to the end of August.</p>",

  "<p>Someone out there \u2013 and she's almost certainly not pregnant \u2013 is having a laugh. Every few months, out comes a study \u2013 the latest is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/31/women-pregnancy-alchohol-birth-defects\">published today</a> \u2013 advising mothers-to-be on whether it's safe, or not, to drink during pregnancy.</p> <p>First it was safe (my mother had the occasional drink through five pregnancies in the 1960s and 1970s without a second thought); then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/25/health.medicineandhealth\">it wasn't</a>. Then it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/oct/11/health.science\">was again</a>. Then it wasn't, with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence deciding women shouldn't drink at all for the first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/mar/26/health.nhs\">three months</a>.</p> <p>Now here's another study, and a big one at that, involving 12,495 children and saying something different again. An occasional drink (one or two units a week) may actually benefit your child, it says, by reducing the risk of behavioural problems, and improving vocabulary and the ability to identify shapes, colours, letters and numbers. It's less clear whether these advantages apply to girls but, say the researchers, if you're having a boy, and you drink a little, he's in luck.</p> <p>Confused? Well, I certainly am. What's a mother-to-be to do: have an ultrasound scan to check the sex, then drink for a boy and abstain for a girl? Chances are you'll find yourself settling down with your small sauvignon (assuming it's a boy of course) in three or four months' time, only to pick up a paper telling you on no account to have an alcoholic drink (especially if it's a boy).</p> <p>Pregnant women aren't as daft as the folks on the research gravy train seem to imagine. There's a perfectly straightforward, commonsense view here, and it's this. Getting sloshed while you're pregnant, or trying to get pregnant, isn't wise. Having a couple of glasses of wine once or twice a week is absolutely fine. That was my view through my four pregnancies, and if you're pregnant yourself it is probably your view \u2013 whatever the latest research says or doesn't say. We can't, after all, raise babies (even while they're still inside us) in a risk-free environment. But mothers (and fathers) have instincts, which is how they've managed to raise their offspring successfully through hundreds and thousands of years. These endless studies serve to confuse rather than illuminate: worse, they reinforce the ideal that there's a \"perfect\" state for pregnancy and motherhood.</p> <p>Worse still, they undermine a mother's natural ability to do what's best for her baby, by attempting to tie her to some academic's apron strings rather than encouraging her to think for herself, and to trust the most vital safety net of all: her instinct.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown said today that the price of petrol at the pumps ought to be coming down faster.</p> <p>The prime minister said that customers ought to be able to take advantage of the plummeting price of oil.</p> <p>Brown was addressing a business breakfast in Edinburgh this morning, before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/31/glenrothes-byelection\">embarking on a day of campaigning on the Glenrothes byelection trail</a>.</p> <p>He also told business leaders that the Scottish banking industry could come through the current crisis, after the multibillion-pound government bail-out of HBOS and the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p> <p>The prime minister said that many people were facing difficulties with their gas and electricity bills because of the price of oil. And he added: \"The price at the petrol pump is coming down and it should come down faster.</p> <p>\"The oil price trebled and people paid a huge price for that. The oil price has halved and I want people to get the full benefit of that and I want that to be fed through to people.\"</p> <p>Brown is due to visit the Gulf states later this month to address the unstable oil price.</p> <p>Food prices, energy bills and the transport industry are among the areas which suffer a knock-on effect when fuel prices rise.</p> <p>\"It's affecting everyone,\" Brown said. \"More people shaking their heads when they go to a petrol station and find what the price of petrol has gone up to as a result of oil prices. Now oil prices are going down and this is our chance to get a stable energy market.\"</p> <p>He said that one reason for the fall was that oil-producing states saw other countries, such as the UK, investing in alternative energies. This included nuclear power, as well as investments in renewables and electric cars.</p> <p>\"As long as we can show that there are alternatives to oil and that they are going to come on stream, then I think you're going to see a change in the attitude of oil producers and that's happening in the oil markets,\" he added.</p> <p>Brown said that HBOS and the Royal Bank of Scotland had faced \"huge problems\" and reiterated previous calls to banks for faster action to write off their bad debts.</p> <p>\"I believe that our Scottish banking system can come through this,\" he said. \"We can be stronger in the future if we adopt the difficult decisions that are necessary to put us on a solid foundation for the future.\"</p> <p>Brown said that a critical issue was that banks started lending again, adding that a condition of the government bail-out had been that lending returned to 2007 levels.</p> <p>He said that low interest rates and falling inflation, along with lower national debt than other countries, would help the UK through the current economic turbulence.</p> <p>\"It is the first global crisis that we're having to deal with in this new industrial age where so much is global,\" he said. \"I'm confident that the opportunities for our economy are great in the years to come.\"</p>",
  "<p>The economic crisis has seen the government act with a boldness of which many doubted it was capable. Similar boldness is now needed to confront damaging systemic inequalities, which have contributed to the crisis and which New Labour has all too often sidestepped or papered over. The underlying structural weaknesses of high risk, bonus-crazy capitalism have been exposed. At last, ministers are extending the language of irresponsibility, so often used to try to change the behaviour of those at the bottom, to nail those at the top for their culpability. </p> <p>As we face recession, rising unemployment and economic uncertainty, Labour must now use what may well be its last chance to reassure and inspire with a concrete vision of the good society and a clear explanation of why building it must be a priority. </p> <p>Equality, combined with ecological sustainability in an agenda for environmental justice, has to be the central leitmotif of this new social, economic and democratic settlement. The immediate target must be to reduce the gap between rich and poor by the next general election. Despite the improvement since 2000 identified by the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/document/53/0,3343,en_2649_33933_41460917_1_1_1_1,00.html\"> OECD</a>, the gap is still wider than in 1997 and than in three-quarters of OECD countries. This means urgently stepping up action against poverty at the bottom while, at the top, a more fundamental assault is required on the huge disparities of rewards than is involved in merely depriving (some) bankers of their bonuses. </p> <p>At a time when many more may have to turn to the safety net of the benefits system, it is more urgent than ever to strengthen it so as to ensure an income that enables people to live decently and with dignity in keeping with human rights principles. There could not be a worse time to wield new sticks to push jobless people into a shrinking labour market, as envisaged in the welfare reform green paper. A large-scale green reconstruction programme, as recommended in <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/\">A Green New Deal</a>, could spearhead a new environmental justice initiative. </p> <p>With public spending and borrowing under pressure, part of the cost of protecting the poorest victims of the crisis, should be met by the wealthy fulfilling their responsibilities to society through more progressive taxes. Exceptional times call for exceptional measures we are told. So, it is legitimate for the government to renege on its manifesto pledge not to raise the higher rate of income tax. The case for a higher rate of 50% for high earners still stands. If applied to those earning over \u00a3100,000 per year, it could raise nearly \u00a38bn, more than twice the minimum needed to meet the next child poverty target, even allowing for any behavioural changes in response to the tax increase. Such changes could be minimised through much tougher action on widespread tax abuses. The money is more likely to boost the economy in the pockets of low income mothers than the bank accounts of high earning men. Inheritance tax must also be reformed to reduce wealth inequalities.</p> <p>In July, a man on incapacity benefit wrote to the Guardian that he and his wife \"sit destroyed by poverty \u2026 I can speak but have no voice, and those claiming to represent me have failed me. As the gas and electric prices rise for all, they may also become out of reach for many. Now I fear the winter and hope for nothing\". Hope not fear is what the government must now provide for him and millions of others.</p> <p><em>\"After New Labour\", the second debate in the \"Who owns the progressive future?\" series, organised by Comment is free and <a href=\"http://www.soundings.org.uk/\">Soundings journal</a>, will take place in London at <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/\">Kings Place</a> on November 3 at 7pm.

  "<p>There were plenty of subjects other than the recession to divert business watchers this week.

Don't think so...\"</p> <p>On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell and Alistair Darling fuelled the discussion. The former by posting a 71% rise in profits and the later by calling on oil companies to pass on lower costs to consumers by cutting petrol prices. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/30/oil-royaldutchshell?commentid=5344640f-eaa7-4b2b-9e48-aa6d0bfa2881\">emma2001</a> wrote: \"How is this for a solution?

  "<p>BT has shocked investors by warning on profits and ousting the head of its underperforming IT services operation in a move that sent shares in the telecoms company to their lowest since it was floated by Margaret Thatcher's government in 1984.</p> <p>Chief executive Ian Livingston, who took over the helm just four months ago, admitted that the performance of BT Global Services had been \"particularly disappointing\" and second-quarter profits would miss City expectations as a result.</p> <p>Shareholders, meanwhile, worried that the setback could force BT to slash its dividend, which is among the most attractive in the FTSE 100. BT had pledged to increase the payout this year, but after the company said its interim payment would be frozen at last year's level, shareholders reckon its final payment could be drastically reduced. </p> <p>The fear caused a dramatic fall in BT's shares price, which plunged under the 130p level at which the company listed over two decades ago. The 19% fall - the most dramatic in the company's history - wiped more than \u00a32bn off BT's value.</p> <p>BT said Fran\u00e7ois Barrault had resigned with immediate effect to be replaced as head of BT Global Services by Hanif Lalani, the company's finance director. Barrault will receive almost \u20ac1m in compensation under his contract.</p> <p>Although BT Global Services has been successful in winning new business with major global customers such as Reuters and Unilever, costs have spiralled out of control under the 18-month leadership of the Frenchman. </p> <p>As a result, Lalani is expected to force through a raft of cost cutting which is expected to lead to job losses among BT Global Services' worldwide workforce of 37,000. A BT spokesman refused to comment on the level of potential job losses but insiders fear hundreds could be axed.</p> <p>BT Global Services was set up more than five years ago to move the company into the lucrative market for IT services. It already accounts for a sizeable chunk of the group's revenues, but its profitability has consistently failed to live up to the City's expectations. In the first quarter of this year the unit made revenues of \u00a32.2bn - more than 40% of BT's total quarterly revenues - but its profit was just \u00a3239m, compared with group profits of more than \u00a31.4bn. </p> <p>Two years ago the board set the business a \"medium term\" target of profit margins of 15%, but progress towards that has been glacial. BT admitted that its margins would be in the range of just 7% to 8% this year. Profits in the second quarter of this year, meanwhile, will be down,at \u00a3120m.</p> <p>\"We acknowledge that the performance in this part of the group is unsatisfactory and are committed to taking decisive action to rectify the situation,\" said Livingston.</p> <p>The poor performance of BT Global Services \u2014 which stands in stark contrast to the rest of the business, which is performing in line with expectations despite the economic downturn - has shattered the forecasts for the company as a whole which Livingston announced in July. At the time he said BT would increase revenue, profits before financial charges and earnings per share this year. Now it expects to increase only revenues.<br></p>",
  "<p>Barclays is raising up to \u00a37.3bn, mainly from Middle East investors who could end up owning nearly a third of the UK's second largest bank. The move announced today allows the bank to strengthen its balance sheet to ride out the financial crisis without getting help from the taxpayer.</p> <p>Most of the cash injection is coming from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/sovereignwealthfunds\">the royal families of Abu Dhabi and Qatar</a>, who have both agreed to pump billions into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay\">Barclays</a> to bolster its capital ratios. The Qataris, who already own a significant shareholding in Barclays through two different investment funds, are providing up to \u00a32.3bn. Once the deal goes through they will own up to 15.5% of the bank. </p> <p>Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family, will provide up to \u00a33.5bn and will become Barclays' largest shareholder with a 16.3% stake. A further \u00a31.5bn is being raised from institutional investors.</p> <p>The deal means that Barclays has avoided selling a stake to the UK government - the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">partial nationalisation option taken by Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and HBOS</a>. </p> <p>This means it will avoid restrictions on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/executivesalaries\">executive pay</a>, bonuses and shareholder dividends.</p> <p>The two Middle Eastern royal families appear to be getting generous terms in return for injecting capital into Barclays.</p> <p>A large chunk of the \u00a35.8bn investment will buy \"reserve capital instruments\", similar to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/businessglossary1\">the preference shares</a> which the UK government is taking in RBS and Lloyds TSB-HBOS. They will pay a dividend of 14% a year, compared with the UK government's 12% a year. The new shareholders will also own warrants allowing them to buy shares in Barclays at 197.775p, any time in the next five years.</p> <p>Shares in Barclays jumped by 10% this morning in early trading, but had soon fallen by almost 10% to 185.5p as the City digested the deal.</p> <p>Chairman Marcus Agius brushed aside the suggestion that Barclays was now too reliant on overseas investors. \"This is a forward-looking and progressive approach to managing the share register,\" said Aguis, insisting that these deals create new commercial opportunities around the globe.</p> <p>\"When these strategic investors increase the exposure they have to Barclays they naturally leads to new business,\" Aguis added. Last year Barclays sold stakes to the goverments of China and Singapore, and in June this year it raised \u00a34.5bn from new and existing shareholders - including Qatar.</p> <p>Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said Barclays had \"proved the doubters wrong again\".</p> <p>\"Barclays continues to underline management's strength in outflanking its rivals. RBS has been sunk through its desire to win Dutch Bank ABN from the hands of Barclays, whilst the group's knowledge of the wholesale markets and experience of the property downturn of the early 1990s has left it better positioned than the likes of HBOS,\" said Bowman.</p> <p><strong>Satisfying the government</strong></p> <p>Barclays has been forced to raise more capital as part of the bail-out scheme which seven banks and one building society have signed up to in the government's attempt to shore up confidence in the banking system. </p> <p>The chief executive, John Varley, said the deal would enables Barclays to meet the capital issuance plan agreed with the UK authorities earlier this month, following the decision by the Financial Services Authority to increase the capital ratio requirements for all UK banks.</p> <p>\"Today's capital raising provides certainty and speed of execution, and combined with the strong third-quarter performance in a volatile operating environment enables us to continue to implement our strategy and build our business by serving clients and customers around the world,\" said Varley.</p> <p>When the UK banking bail-out was being agreed with the Treasury earlier this month, Varley had convinced government officials and the Financial Services Authority, that it had one backer prepared to stump up \u00a31bn. Roger Jenkins, a colleague of Barclays executive Bob Diamond, is believed to have led the negotiations to find backers prepared to put more cash into the bank.</p> <p>The government is due to announce later today that it has approved the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB. Based on today's share prices, Barclays will still be the UK's second largest bank by market capitalisation, worth almost \u00a319bn, behind HSBC which is today worth some \u00a389bn. Lloyds TSB and HBOS are today worth slightly over \u00a317bn.</p>",

The bank's governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, was forced to step in when it became clear that four members of the board, all with private sector backgrounds, refused to budge.</p> <p>Shirakawa, who just a fortnight ago insisted no action was necessary, appeared to have little choice but to support a cut in borrowing costs at the end of a month in which the Nikkei plummeted to its lowest level for 26 years and the yen surged to a record high against the dollar.</p> <p>The strong yen has eaten into the profits of Japan's exporters, with Sony, Toyota and Fujitsu all reporting miserable profits for the second quarter this week.</p> <p>After they appeared to have been spared the misery affecting their counterparts in the US and Europe, Japanese banks have seen their capital eroded by record falls the Nikkei.</p> <p>Today, Mizuho financial group, Japan's second biggest bank, said it had lowered its profit forecast for the current fiscal year by more than half because of the fall in its share price.</p> <p>The bank, Japan's second biggest by revenue, said it now expects full-year net profit to reach \u00a529bn (\u00a3181bn), down 55% from its previous forecast of \u00a5560bn.</p> <p>The BoJ said a rate cut was necessary to maintain flexibility in the money markets amid signs that Japan's economy is slowing down.</p> <p>\"Adjustments in the world economy stemming from financial crises in the United States and Europe have further increased in severity,\" it said in a statement.</p> <p>\"Under these circumstances, increased sluggishness in Japan's economic activity will likely remain over the next several quarters with exports leveling off and the effects of earlier increases in energy and materials prices persisting.\"</p> <p>The bank said it had concluded that, \"a reduction in policy interest rates and a further increase in the flexibility of money market operations were necessary to maintain accommodative financial conditions.\"</p> <p>Today's cut is the first since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/businessglossary\">Japan introduced a near-zero rate in March 2001</a>, marking the start of its quantitative easing policy, or flooding the market with cash. The policy ended in July 2006 with a modest increase of 0.25%, followed by another 0.25% rise in February last year.</p> <p>The rate cut comes two days after the US Federal Reserve cut rates by 0.5 percentage points to 1%.</p> <p>Next week, the Bank of England is expected to cut at least half a percentage point off its benchmark rate of 4.5% on Thursday.

  "<p>Belt-tightening by American consumers on a scale unprecedented for almost three decades meant the world's biggest economy joined the list of countries in or close to recession, according to official figures released yesterday.</p> <p>The Commerce Department in Washington said both households and businesses were spending less in the three months ending in September.</p> <p>Only military spending by the Pentagon, the boost to exports from the cheaper dollar and stock building by companies spared the US from a more severe contraction in the third quarter. </p> <p>Consumer spending fell at an annual rate of 3.1% between July and September in response to the biggest squeeze on personal disposable incomes since the government began collecting quarterly data in 1947.</p> <p>The Commerce Department said it was the sharpest cut in consumer spending since 1980, with an annualised drop of more than 14% in durable goods such as cars and furniture. Governors of six states urged the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve to take \"immediate action\" to prevent a deepening crisis for the car industry that would become \"an unmanageable disaster\" for state governments.</p> <p>America's central bank cited the weakness of consumer demand when it cut interest rates to 1% on Wednesday. Analysts said the US was likely to fulfil the technical definition of recession - two consecutive quarters of falling GDP - in the final three months of 2008 and would continue to contract in 2009.</p> <p>Paul Ashworth, US analyst for Capital Economics, said the fall in output in the third quarter had been \"the tip of the iceberg\", adding that he expected the economy to contract by 1.5% in 2009 and remain flat in 2010. \"Such a cumulative decline in output would make this one of the worst downturns since the Great Depression,\" he said.</p> <p>The European commission's monthly survey of consumers and businesses in the Eurozone found economic sentiment at its weakest since the recession of the early 1990s. Analysts said the decline in the index from 87.5 to 80.4 during October was consistent with GDP falling by about 1% in 2009 and expressed confidence that the European Central Bank would join the Bank of England in cutting interest rates next Thursday.</p> <p>The Japanese government yesterday unveiled a 27tn yen (\u00a3170bn) stimulus package to help small businesses and provide emergency cash to families and is today expected to cut interest rates for the first time in seven years.</p> <p>Two months ago parliament passed an \u00a511.7tn stimulus package to counter rising food and energy prices. That Japan should be raiding its war chest for the second time since August was seen as a clear indication that after months of skirting the worst effects of the financial crisis, the world's second-biggest economy is heading for trouble. </p> <p>\"The global financial crisis is almost certain to affect Japan's real economy,\" the prime minister, Taro Aso, said in a televised news conference. \"We understand that the most important thing is to assure the security of average households.\" </p> <p>He said the world was in the midst of a \"financial storm that comes along once every 100 years\". The stimulus, equivalent to about 1.2% of Japan's annual GDP, will include \u00a52tn in benefits for households, or about \u00a560,000 for every family of four, as well as expanded loans for small businesses and tax relief on mortgages. </p> <p>Financial markets responded positively to the prospect of action from policy makers. The FTSE 100 was up almost 50 points, while the Dow Jones was up 150 points in early afternoon trading.</p>",
  "<p>The price of petrol at the pump is not falling as fast as the price of oil from peak levels over the summer, according to Guardian analysis.</p> <p>The average pump price is falling by about a penny every five days but still has 5.8p a litre to drop if it is to catch up with recent sharp declines in the price of oil.</p> <p>A fierce price war - led by Asda, Morrisons and more recently Tesco - has seen prices fall in recent weeks at about twice the rate at which they had inched upwards earlier in the year. Yesterday the average price reached 97.96p a litre.</p> <p>But Alistair Darling, the chancellor, yesterday demanded that oil companies move faster to pass on the fall in prices to customers on station forecourts. </p> <p>Speaking on GMTV, Darling said: \" A few months ago, the price of crude oil coming out of the ground was about $150 a barrel. Now it's down to about $60. I want to see that reduction passed on to the pumps as quickly as possible.\"</p> <p>He said: \" People are entitled to see the benefit of that falling price reflected in what they actually pay when they go and fill up their car.\" </p> <p>His comments came as Shell smashed analyst forecasts when it reported a profit of $10.9bn (\u00a36.6bn) for the third quarter of 2008, up from $6.4bn the previous year, thanks to the earlier surge in the price of oil.</p> <p>The fall in the petrol price has helped Labour believe it could yet win the Glenrothes byelection next Thursday. </p> <p>The oil companies complain that about 70% of the cost of a litre of petrol goes to the government as duty and VAT, so the drop in crude oil prices can only have a limited effect on the cost of filling up at the pump. </p> <p>Darling is under pressure to help motorists by scrapping the planned rise of 2p a litre in fuel duty, which has been postponed until March 2009.</p> <p>But Yvette Cooper, chief secretary to the Treasury, joined the attack on the oil firms, telling MPs: \"It is important, with world oil prices coming down, [that] those cuts be passed on to consumers because the price increases were certainly passed on to consumers. </p> <p>\"We have seen many petrol companies passing on price cuts, and it would be good to see all petrol companies bringing prices down right across the country. Gas and electric companies could also do more to pass on reductions in oil prices in their fuel bills\"</p> <p>The energy and climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, has already met the energy companies twice to discuss the price of electricity, and has warned he has found signs of lack of competition in the UK energy market.</p> <p>He is waiting for a report from Ofgem the energy regulator, and has said he would legislate if necessary. </p> <p>Oil peaked at $147.27 a barrel in July and six days later there followed a peak in the average UK pump prices for petrol at 119.7p a litre. </p> <p>Since then, fears of a global recession have strengthened, wiping away more than half of the dollar-value of a barrel of oil. The price of oil yesterday reached $65.44 a barrel, a decline of 55.6% from the summer peak. </p> <p>By contrast, the average UK pump price has fallen 18.2%. A lot of this price goes straight to the chancellor so, stripping out VAT and duty, the underlying price of petrol at the pump has fallen from a peak of 51.52p a litre to 33.02p a litre - a decline of 35.9%.</p> <p>Part of the reason this underlying pump price fall does not reflect the decline in oil is the weakening of the pound against the dollar. </p> <p>This means those buying oil in sterling are not able to take the full benefit of the drop in its dollar value. </p> <p>Stripping out this currency impact, the sterling fall in the value of a barrel is 45.5%. If pump prices were to fall by the same proportion, the average pump price would be 92.16p. This would give motorists filling up a 50-litre tank a saving of \u00a32.90.</p> <p>Motorists' groups were confident yesterday that the oil price declines would feed through to the pump. \"I don't think pump prices are too far behind,\" said a spokesman for the Automobile Association. </p> <p>\"There was a race among the supermarkets to get down to \u00a31 a litre, led by Asda and Morrisons. Two weeks ago Tesco started to show its muscle with a 3p drop in prices. Others have had to react quickly.\"</p> <h2>At the pump</h2> <p>\u2022 The price of oil has fallen from its peak of $147.27 a barrel in July to $65.44, a drop of 55.6%</p> <p>\u2022 Adjusting to remove the impact of the weakening pound against the dollar, the sterling fall in the price of a barrel of oil is 45.5%</p> <p>\u2022 The petrol price has fallen from 119.7p a litre in July to 97.96p, a drop of 18.2%. Stripping out VAT and duty, the underlying price of petrol has gone from 51.52p a litre to 33.02p, a drop of 35.9%</p> <p>\u2022 So petrol would cost 92.16p a litre today if the price had fallen by the same proportion as oil</p>",
  "<p>It was during the height of the era of fast-buck capitalism, at a 1988 televised concert celebrating Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday, that Tracy Chapman came out of nowhere and enthralled the world with her songs about social injustice. Just her, an acoustic guitar and a hushed Wembley Stadium. So meeting the protest singer in the exclusive surroundings of a five-star west London hotel suite feels more than a little incongruous. </p> <p>She shuffles into the room, coddling her stinking cold with a chunky red scarf, and blinks out at the magnificent view of Hyde Park. She looks reassuringly unchanged - all long dreadlocks and slouchy clothes. There is still a mighty roll to her cheekbones, and the lurgy has done nothing to cloud her gentle, wise eyes. </p> <p>Back in 1988, her eponymous first album, which included the singles Talkin' 'bout a Revolution, Fast Car and Baby Can I Hold You, went on to be a No 1 hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Her follow-up, Crossroads, was also a UK No 1. Since then, Chapman has continued to record and tour. Next month, aged 44, she will release her eighth studio album, Our Bright Future. </p> <p>Despite the optimistic-sounding title, Chapman has not come over all saccharine. According to the song from which the album takes its name, we've been \"Led on led on/ to take the path/ where our bright future/ is in the past\". </p> <p>\"What does the future look like if the heads of society ask our young people to risk their lives for questionable causes?\" she asks, matter-of-factly in her familiar woodwind voice. \"I think it looks rather bleak.\" After 20 years of being called upon to comment on global humanitarian issues, Chapman talks with cautious measure and studied compassion. </p> <p>When she was 16 and living with her sister and single mother on welfare in Cleveland, Ohio, Chapman won a scholarship to a private boarding school in Connecticut. This, she says, was the pivotal moment in her life, and one of the reasons she is so highly politicised. \"I have always felt immensely grateful for that opportunity. Then I received an academic scholarship to go to college [where she studied anthropology and African studies]. That wouldn't have happened if there weren't people who had given something to make that possible for me.\"</p> <p>Chapman had endured a terrible childhood. \"The city had been forced to integrate the schools so they were bussing black children into white neighbourhoods, and white children into black neighbourhoods, and people were upset about it so there were race riots. A lot of kids spent more time out of school than in, but I always loved school and thought it was my way out of Cleveland, and out of poverty.\" She has said that her bookishness led to her being bullied. As, indeed, did her race. She grew accustomed to racial abuse and assaults on her way home from school. </p> <p>She started playing guitar aged 11 and was writing protest songs by her early teens. Her first album came out when she was 24. Although, she recalls, \"My first record was almost not my first record.\" After she signed the deal to make the album, the proposed producer was killed in a car accident and the record company called in someone far less experienced to take over. Chapman, four session musicians and the new producer were recording near Woodstock in New York state. \"He put me in the middle of the room. They were all around me, everybody was playing wildly because he gave them very little direction ... And the music was horrible. Bombastic.</p> <p>\"So I called the production company after a few days saying, 'This doesn't sound good.' And they were like, 'We think it's all right, just stick it out.'\" After a few more days, it still wasn't working. \"They insisted again that I continue so I just said, 'I'm leaving.'\"</p> <p>Was she the only woman in this situation? \"Yeah. It was like, you're young, you're inexperienced, you're a woman even, what do you know about any of this?'\" </p> <p>The record company eventually relented, however and her early success meant that she has been treated with respect since then. But she says she has still occasionally faced \"sexist attitudes\" when taking an active role in the production of her records. \"Say I would notice a problem with the tonality, people would say, 'Oh, that'll be fine,' or 'You're not hearing what you think you're hearing.'\"</p> <p>Is it harder for women in the industry in general? \"Definitely,\" she says. \"I was trying to make a case for Madonna the other day, saying that she's to be admired for her longevity in a genre that has mostly been for younger acts. Men are able to sustain a career into their 50s and 60s and still present themselves as sex symbols. With women on the other hand, people say, 'Why doesn't she retire?' It's just so unfair. So I have to give props to Madonna.\"</p> <p>Chapman is regularly associated with Amnesty International, the American Foundation for Aids Research, Free Tibet and the anti-war lobby, but one cause she doesn't speak about much is feminism. Is she even a feminist? \"Yeah, course. I think it just doesn't come up because ... people think we're beyond it. There have been some gains made in terms of more equality for women in the workplace and in the way the legal system deals with issues of violence against women.\" However, she says, \"taking the recent campaign for the [Democratic presidential] nomination, if you look at the way Hillary Clinton was treated compared with Barack Obama, there seemed to be a double standard. People would make comments on what she was wearing all the time, saying that she was too emotional, even hysterical, and therefore unfit to be commander in chief. Yes, we still need to have a discussion and there needs to be improvement.\"</p> <p>Though an Obama supporter, she would have been happy with Clinton. \"It's strange how things come to pass,\" she muses. \"Hillary Clinton's candidacy would not have been possible without Bill [Clinton]. And Sarah Palin's spot on the Republican ticket would not be possible without Hillary Clinton. McCain saw how popular Hillary was.\" How about Condoleezza Rice - a black woman who did it on her own? Chapman grimaces. \"I don't even want to mention her because her values are so contrary to mine. She's definitely ... It's not fair to not consider her,\" she concedes.</p> <p>\"The one good thing about Palin being on the ticket is that it continues to bring up discussion about women in politics. There's a very curious thing I saw the other day which is that she belongs to some kind of evangelical Christian religious group that doesn't allow female pastors, but her church is supporting her in her effort to be vice-president. And that same church also publicly states that women shouldn't take a leadership role in their homes. And that they should be in willing submission to their husbands. How does she deal with this?\"</p> <p>The new record isn't all politics. Rather it is a set of tenderly honed folk and country songs addressing themes of family and love, as well as war and religion. Then there's I Did It All, in which the protagonist is a washed-up soak. Chapman channels the song's lead character with vicarious glee. \"I imagine her in a smoky club, and she's stumbling around, trying to tell anyone who'll listen about what she thinks of as her glorious past,\" she giggles. \"She walks around most of the day in some kind of negligee, with tattered hems. Her hair is done but it's a little loose. Makeup, but slightly smudged lipstick.\" Chapman clearly loves this game. Is she trying to show us a little-known side of herself? \"No!\" she exclaims, before adding: \"Someone asked what I was arrested for, because they picked up on the 'They read me the rights' line [in the song], but I was not in jail!\" Then she remembers to add, \"There are good reasons for being in jail - for protesting\".</p> <p>\u2022 Tracy Chapman's new album <strong>Our Bright Future</strong> is released on November 10 by Elektra Records. She tours the UK in December.</p>",
  "<p>US credit card company American Express is shedding 7,000 jobs as it grapples with a surge in bad debts among customers who are feeling the pinch from the global economic slowdown. In a sign that the credit crunch has reached even relatively affluent cardholders, AmEx is embarking on cuts to save $1.8bn (\u00a31.1bn) annually.</p> <p>AmEx's workforce will be reduced by 10%.

  "<h2>Paul Auster<br>Author</h2> <p>I'm hard-pressed to think of a single thing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgebush\">Bush</a> administration has done to promote the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture\">arts</a>. Things have gone on as before: novelists are writing books, people read them or don't read them, movies are being made and people go or don't go, artists are painting pictures, people are making music. I don't see that the Bush people have affected the cultural landscape that much.</p> <p>These past eight years have been about the worst that I can imagine. For the first time as a writer I've addressed, here and there, the situation that we're living through. I'd never done that before and I guess because I've been so alarmed, so distraught, the pressure of this unhappiness has spilled over into my work at times.</p> <p>If <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">McCain</a> wins, I feel like going into a cellar for the next four years or going out in the streets every day and screaming. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Obama</a>, if he does win, is going to have so many problems to deal with that the most one could hope for would be to undo some of the damage. Most artists seem to be for Obama. In fact, I haven't met a single one who is for McCain, so our spirits would be lifted. The problems in the country will remain as serious as ever.</p> <p>Art isn't journalism. Some of the greatest historical novels were written long after the events discussed in the book. You think of War and Peace, written in 1870 about things that happened in 1812. I think there's this confusion in the minds of the public that artists are supposed to respond immediately to things that are going on. We've been living through a new era. Everyone knows the world has changed, but exactly where the story is taking us is unclear right now and until it plays out further I don't know if anyone has a clear vision of what's happening. </p> <h2>Joyce Carol Oates<br>Writer</h2> <p>The \"cultural legacy of George W Bush\" would seem to be the punchline of a cruel joke, if there could be anything remotely funny about the Bush administration. (There isn't: nothing funny, and nothing of a legacy.) But the National book festival, hosted each September by former librarian Laura Bush on the Mall in Washington is a truly valuable cultural event, which we can hope that the wife of George W's successor will wish to continue.</p> <p>The cultural life of America is a thing quite apart from the federal government. It can flourish, as in the Johnson-Nixon eras, as counter-culture; in times of political debasement, art can be idealistic and ahistorical. Most artists live through a sequence of administrations, and their art evolves in ways too individual to be related to larger, generic forces.</p> <p>The cultural life of America would be relatively unchanged if McCain wins, since he is a variant of Bush. If Obama wins, very likely there would be an efflorescence of a kind, perhaps most evident in the more public artforms - dance, music, theatre. </p> <p>We can hope!</p> <h2>Gore Vidal<br>Writer</h2> <p>Although all politicians tell lies, Bush has gone right round the bend as a liar and he'll be remembered for a great many of the lies, starting with weapons of mass destruction and going on and on. That's the only legacy. Oliver Stone, I gather, is doing father-and-son stories. I'm very fond of Oliver, but you don't need Freud when you're dealing with Caligula.</p> <p>One of the problems is that journalists think this is just a familiar phenomenon, this administration. It isn't - there isn't anything like it. It doesn't bode well for anything at all - it's just there. Culture goes on. People go on writing novels even though the general public doesn't want to read them. I think the plucky few will continue and to predict what the next wrinkle will be is not very useful.</p> <p>We have a president who cannot read. He's dyslexic, as was his father before him. It must have an effect. I watch a good deal of television because of the elections. The professional television people, all of them graduates of our finest universities, can't use proper English. We are losing the language, I suppose.</p> <p>Art is always needed in a country that doesn't much like it. Performance is all anybody cares about.</p> <h2>Paul Miller<br>AKA DJ Spooky</h2> <p>Under Reagan and Thatcher you had the rise of an internationalist view of music, especially with punk, reggae, and dub. The Bush administration has left a legacy of numbness - what do you rebel against when, essentially, the establishment just doesn't care what you think?</p> <p>Usually when you have a rightwing lunatic such as Nixon, or more cynical regimes such as Reagan or Bush I's administration, there's a counterpoint. What ended up happening with Bush II is that the counter-culture response became incoherent.</p> <p>The \"culture-entertainment\" industry is different now. They realise that the idea of rebellion can be made into an echo-chamber and sold back to you. We have rebellion on the radio, songs that are anti-establishment, \"mavericks\" for president, but on the other hand you have the Dixie Chicks and the reaction when they said stuff against the war. You can see that there's still a tremendous reactionary culture in the US.</p> <p>The meta-narrative is that anything goes: Britney Spears giving herself a haircut or the \"hyper-realism\" of the execution of Saddam Hussein spreading like video wildfire on people's cellphones. It's incoherence - montaged and edited a la Oliver Stone. Is the president a mirror that speaks to you? I don't think so.</p> <h2>Elizabeth LeCompte<br>Theatre director</h2> <p>He has fostered the rise of political satire as an art form again. It hasn't been very strong for the last 30 years or so and I think television programmes such as The Daily Show, The Colbert Report and South Park are all political works of art. Without the Bush administration I don't think satire would have been as strong. It revived irony. </p> <p>Theatre in America is in decline, however. A lot of the people who would have been writing for the theatre 100 years ago are now writing in television. In America, all art is denigrated, basically, with the possible exception of music. Written and spoken arts aren't taken seriously here, and I don't think they've ever been. </p> <p>People are starting to view politics as entertainment much more. That's why the number of people voting is up. YouTube has made politicians entertainers. With satire there's an incredibly powerful challenging of the powers that are, which I think is very healthy. There's also a trivialising effect at the same time. But it is a change, because young people are going to be involved in politics in a way that they haven't been before.</p> <p>When Obama had trouble, before he beat Hillary, they began to make fun of him as a pompous teacher, so let's see. I think it'll be interesting. I just know that for me, under the Bush administration, things like The Daily Show and South Park will be remembered as real satire, not just parody and caricature. </p> <h2>Edward Albee<br>Playwright</h2> <p>What cultural legacy? There is no cultural legacy. We have an administration of criminality, complicity and incompetence but no cultural legacy whatever from those eight years. It doesn't seem to have produced the kind of rage that I would have expected it to. It shows me that we have a far more passive and ignorant society than I thought we had.</p> <p>The only value the arts have is commercial. I have found over the past eight years that commerce has taken over the arts in the United States.</p> <p>I don't think that the Republican administration could have gotten away with everything that it did had it not had a complacent and compliant society. That troubles me a lot. It tells me sad things about the United States now. The only art that is allowed any great exposure is commercial art that is not going to rock the boat.</p> <p>I always have hope. Somebody asked Beckett once why he writes if he's such a pessimist. He said, \"If I were a pessimist I wouldn't write.\" I'm something of an optimist. I hope that we're capable of getting back on the right track and continuing our peaceful social revolution.</p> <h2>Alex Gibney<br>Film director</h2> <p>I think the Bush administration did its best to create a vast wasteland. At the same time, because of the perfidy and corruption and utter lawlessness it created a very interesting backlash of politically oriented materials that were inspiring. Unintentionally, the administration provoked a lot of political art that I think was very valuable.</p> <p>It contributed to an extraordinary flowering of political documentaries - and not necessarily pure anti-Bush ones. The administration provoked a thoughtfulness, both in aesthetic terms and in terms of political thinking, that expressed itself in documentaries in a very exciting way. Iraq in Fragments, for instance, was a beautiful film - not overtly political but political in a deeper sense.</p> <p>I was associated with a global series called Why Democracy? in which film-makers from all over the world looked at democracy at a time when Bush was trying to \"make the world safe for democracy\" - or to pulverise the world to accept his version of it. They were very interesting, perceptive and valuable. So the rise of new documentary in the age of Bush has been a great contribution, if unintended.</p> <p>I think under a McCain administration you'd see a renewed sense of opposition. The cultural world may get even wilder. Under an Obama administration it'll be interesting to see what happens. My fear about Obama is that he's motivated to sweep a lot of stuff under the rug, about his own administration and its ties to very high-powered financial interests. I'm getting ready to start looking at stuff and holding people to account.</p> <p>But I was joking with a friend of mine, Eugene Jarecki, who made Why We Fight, about how we'd better be honing our skills as the directors of romantic comedies, because without the Bush administration, what are political film-makers gonna do? We'll all be out of work. So please, McCain, win!</p> <h2>Lionel Shriver<br>Author</h2> <p>As Oliver Stone's film illustrates, W has been a great inspiration, a beacon on the hill, if you will, for artists in every field. Although perhaps not the kind of inspiration that the president would have wished. </p> <p>Among many other works, Michael Moore's mocking Fahrenheit 9/11, Ian McEwan's Saturday, Brian Haw's Iraq-protest-turned-Turner-prize-winner-turned-West-End-play (The State We're In), and David Hare's Stuff Happens all have a notoriously incompetent American president to thank for their success. Bush's inability to put a sentence together without repeating the same word five times and chronic mispronunciation \"nucular\" have provided a feast for comics all over the world. </p> <p>So the Bush years have been great for the arts, restoring a collusive, adversarial climate last seen circa 1968. Hate figures are far more motivating than heroes, and W has graciously provided the collectively leftwing artistic community an embarrassment of riches. In fact, the biggest problem with the Bush era's artistic legacy is that this widely despised president has tended to inspire polemics and agitprop. Many novels, films, plays, and artworks from the last eight years have been spitting with indignation, painfully obvious in their political intent, sledgehammer subtle in their execution, and clubby - since most of these works are preaching to the converted. Thus W may have bequeathed a whack of subject matter, but whether any of this stuff will be of enduring value is open to question. You have to ask yourself whether the diatribes denouncing Bush in a novel, such as JM Coetzee's Diary of a Bad Year (a book trying enough when it was published in 2007), will hold the faintest interest after January 2009.</p> <p>And here's the really bad news: Obama could be terrible for the arts. Why, when there's barely an artist in the States who doesn't support him? Art thrives on resistance. There's nothing more arid, more enervating, more stultifying, or more utterly uninspiring than getting your way. </p> <h2>Trisha Brown<br>Choreographer</h2> <p>I was given a list of people in Congress who might be open to talking about the arts. One senator asked me, \"Is this like that woman who does dance?\" turned to an assistant and said, \"Who was that person?\" He meant Martha Graham. The discussion was not bitter whatsoever, but it was frightening because I learned that these people are not thinking at all about arts.</p> <p>One Congressman said to me, \"Well, is Joe Six-Pack gonna really be interested in this?\" I said, well, we certainly have a country brim-full of great artists and maybe Joe Six-Pack has a couple of kids in the house and they might be interested in music, or painting, or dance. That was the most I could move him without getting into combat.</p> <p>I was lobbying, trying to bring them information. The other person who's memorable from that excursion said, \"Do you know who I think is the greatest artist?\" so I said, \"No, I don't know\" and he said, \"God\". I went home like a whipped puppy. I saw that there was no thought about it. My heart was broken.</p> <p>I thought young artists would go to bat sooner. There are some people who are dedicated to responding to political issues and many who are not. If you're a painter or a sculptor there's money. If you're in dance, there's very little for independent artists. It's very discouraging. I was so in love with art-making - but I'm tired of the suppression of arts and I've shifted into other disciplines to find vitality and exchange.</p> <h2>David Simon<br>TV writer/producer</h2> <p>Enron, Afghanistan, Iraq, New Orleans, Wall Street. An untenable drug war. A non-existent energy policy. An obliviousness to climate change. An unwillingness to recognise our problems, much less begin the hard work of solving them. Incompetence - rank incompetence - has become the American standard. We are no longer a competent, responsible nation-state. America. The can't-do superpower. Quite a legacy. Mr Bush is a remarkable man.</p> <h2>Naomi Wolf<br>Author</h2> <p>Bush's cultural legacy? It's disturbing that my initial response is to draw a blank. But it's a sign of the fact that the past eight years have simply pushed the arts to an underground place. It's not just that [Bush] didn't fund the arts or invite artists to the White House; it's not just that he doesn't read poetry, doesn't read books: there's something about the brute force of this administration, and the fetishisation of brute force by this administration, which literally stands in opposition to civilisation and the arts. </p> <p>I've done a lot of work on Germany from the Weimar period to the late 30s. There was a similar hostility then to the cosmopolitan, the urbanite, the avant garde, to any originality in art. Some of the most interesting visual artists we've seen in recent times, for example, were working behind the iron curtain, and of course, they had to work allegorically.</p> <p>Much of the protest work I've seen [in America] has been very bad, pedantic, heavy-handed. I've seen so many bad monologues about the Iraq war, so many dreadful photo-montages. I think it's because Americans don't quite understand repression yet. They're not yet understanding the nature of the force that has come down on them, by drawing on their subconscious, by expressing themselves in an allegorical way. And I think artists in America are scared. Respected journalists are being arrested. Film documenting the Republican national congress has been destroyed. And artists are next on the list after journalists. So if, God forbid, there's a McCain/Palin presidency we'll see a crackdown of the police state, there's no doubt. </p> <p>I'm really quite ashamed of the American people - and of course I include myself in this. We have seen what was happening, and we kept right on internet shopping. All these writers and artists, good people, have just looked around and quietly aligned themselves. Novelists have been really silent. Usually writers are at the forefront of denouncing a regime: look at V\u00e1clav Havel. Here, people have complained a lot, but in terms of organising a vanguard of resistance, of people getting out there and saying this is not the American way ... Where is the Arthur Miller of this generation? Who is out front, somewhere visible and tricky and scary? </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The End of America</strong>, a documentary based on Naomi Wolf's book of the same name, has its UK premiere on November 7 at the Sheffield Doc/Fest </p> <h2>Daniel Libeskind<br>Architect </h2> <p>How can you even begin to speak of a cultural legacy? It's been wholly negative. Culture's a dirty word to these people, like \"liberal\" or \"literate\". We've experienced a complete bankruptcy of the culture of ideas over the past eight years. The intellect has been denigrated. Deep cuts have been made in education and in investment in cultural institutions.</p> <p>At Ground Zero, we're not sure if the performing arts centre planned will ever happen. This was a key part of the masterplan, but all that's mattered in the World of Bush is the workings, and failures, of the market economy. So, Ground Zero could yet end up, unless we get a sympathetic new president, as a purely commercial venture, with a memorial, rather than as a springboard for American culture.</p> <p>It's hard to believe Bush, a man who's proud not to read books and who makes fun of words longer than one syllable, has been the inheritor of the mantle of the Founding Fathers, or of Woodrow Wilson, FDR or even Bill Clinton. These people believed in the value of American culture being seen as an inspiring and civilising force around the world. Jefferson was a fine architect. All Bush has offered the world is military force. This is still a great country, but Bush and Cheney have ensured that only the negative side of US culture has spread around the world.</p> <p>\u2022 Interviews by <strong>Andrew Purcell</strong>, <strong>Jon Henley</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Glancey</strong></p>",
  "<p>The average price of a house in Britain is \u00a330,000 less than it was a year ago, Nationwide said yesterday, with prices tumbling in the year to October at their sharpest rate since 1952.</p> <p>Britain's biggest building society said prices fell 14.6% over the past 12 months to \u00a3158,872, and dropped 1.4% in the month to October - the 12th monthly fall in a row. </p> <p>Nationwide said that despite the fall, housing transactions were at their lowest level since 1974. Fionnuala Earley, the society's chief economist, said one explanation was that it was only sellers willing to negotiate on price who were seeing sales go through. \"While others refuse to cut their price, the levels of activity are constrained.\"</p> <p>Economists have predicted that house prices have a lot further to fall. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight, said: \"Faster rising unemployment, major concerns over recession and widespread expectations that house prices will come down further seem set to depress housing market activity and prices for some considerable time to come.\" </p> <p>Consultants Capital Economics forecast this week that prices would fall 35% by the end of next year and Andrew Clare, professor of asset management at Cass business school, said prices would not regain their 2007 peak until 2023.</p> <p>Nationwide is the first major lender to report on the state of the market in October and many had hoped that transactions had picked up after the Bank of England cut interest rates by 50 basis points, to 4.5%, earlier in the month. </p> <p>However, analysts said that lower interest rates were not helping free up the mortgage markets.</p> <p>Ed Stansfield, property economist at consultants Capital Economics, said: \"We expect the Bank of England will cut interest rates to 1%. With unemployment rising and expectations that house prices have much further to fall still widespread, lower interest rates will not stimulate housing demand. Lower interest rates will also do nothing to loosen mortgage lending criteria.\" </p> <p>Bank of England mortgage data this week showed that mortgage approvals in September were 67% down on the same month a year ago. Banks and building societies have raised interest rates on mortgages as the credit crunch worsens. </p> <p>Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, Lord Oakeshott, said: \"British house prices and house builders are being hammered by rising unemployment, as in the 1990s recession. </p> <p>\"The government must empower councils and housing associations to spend the \u00a38bn affordable housing allocation now on buying unsold homes and land at bargain basement prices. That will rescue hundreds of thousands of families from housing squalor and hundreds of thousands of builders from the dole queue.\"</p> <p>Philip Hammond, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"These figures are yet more bad news for all those families who stretched themselves financially to buy their homes. It seems inevitable that more negative equity and repossessions are on the way.\"</p>",
  "<p>For centuries adults have been deriding young people for their laziness, venality, sexuality, shallowness and lack of moral fibre. Now they've added another item to the classic list of youthful failings: a lack of respect for their own privacy.</p> <p>For years a procession of paedo scare-stories have warned us that the youth of today fail to grasp the importance of maintaining their privacy online. Kids blithely hand over their personal information to sites like MySpace and Bebo and Facebook, take naughty pictures of themselves, MMS them to their friends' phones, and engage in saucy chat with mysterious older men.</p> <p>But if kids are careless with their personal information, can we blame them? A deadly combination of universal surveillance, a prohibition on protecting your privacy (\"No hoodies allowed near the CCTVs!\"), and a relentless focus on the consequences of dangers (as opposed to their probability) has placed the world in grave danger. Tomorrow's leaders will have been raised in an environment where any rational assessment of security has been rendered impossible by a shrill and terrified public discourse.</p> <p>Any expenditure, any invasion, can be justified in the name of preventing terrorist attacks, which are, indeed, terrible. The 7/7 bombers blew up the bus and train my wife and I usually took, and only chance kept us safe. But a rational approach to safety has to be built on a rational cost-benefit analysis that reflects the probability of the danger, not how awful it is. </p> <p>Terrorism is lurid and horrible, but it's awfully uncommon. So are paedo attacks from strangers - practically every attack on a child is from a family member or authority figure. Young people subjected to an endless stream of terrorism and stranger-danger warnings are being taught that it's a thousand times more important to protect yourself from flashy, improbable attacks than to protect yourself against the things that are most likely to harm you.</p> <p>Jacqui Smith's confirmation that technical work is starting on the \u00a312bn plan to wiretap every single phone call, text message, email and web click sends a clear message to young people: the best intelligence is indiscriminate and unmanageable. Independent inquiries such as the US 9/11 commission show that gathering vast haystacks of intelligence does not make it easier to find the minuscule needles within them. US intelligence sources knew everything they needed to predict and prevent the 9/11 attacks - but they also had so much dross mixed in with the relevant intelligence that they were only able to determine this in hindsight. </p> <p>Critics of the giga-database have pointed out the government's explosive data-incontinence, reinforced by Wednesday's report from the information commissioner showing that the number of serious breaches - the lost top-secret laptops and USB sticks - has soared. Putting the giga-database into the hands of the people who have proven so dismal at safeguarding the mega-database is inexplicable. </p> <p>If you don't want your finances and life ruined by a careless bureaucrat, you might switch to an anonymous prepaid phone, encrypt your email, pay cash for your travel card, and give false information to anyone who has no business demanding to know your details. But the masters of the giga-database are taking steps to prevent you from opting out: adding facial recognition to CCTV; replacing magnetic ID cards with ones that use RFID (radio-frequency identification) chips that can be read at a distance without your knowledge; ratcheting up public transport costs so it is impractical to pay cash. And immigrants are being issued mandatory internal passports bearing these chips, in a beta-test for the rest of the nation.</p> <p>To remain safe and free, we must raise the next generation to understand real risk and security. Let's give pocket money based on how many CCTVs our kids can photograph on the way to school. Let's assign kids to survey every local merchant with CCTV aimed at a public road and demand an accounting of their data-protection practices and a rationale for spying on their neighbours. Instead of installing creepy snoopware on school networks, let's train our kids to communicate in unbeatable, cryptographically secured anonymity. Instead of campaigns to warn kids off Bebo or Facebook, let's get them browser tools that render visible the potential privacy threats on each page. Let's replace the snoopy phones that let us spy on their every movement with phones loaded with software that tells them every time their personal information leaks out. </p> <p>When we tell kids to safeguard their privacy from everyone except governments, merchants, advertisers, entertainment giants, schools, Transport for London and parents, we tell them that we're not really serious about this stuff. Worse, when we allow our own private information to be taken by all these parties, we tell them that privacy is the cheapest coin of all. When BT secretly installs spyware in our browsers and captures all our clicks in order to serve ads to us, our lack of outrage tells our kids everything they need to know about the value of privacy.</p> <p>Kids do care about their privacy, but blatant hypocrisy in \"pro-privacy\" campaigns triggers kids' lie detectors and sends them fleeing in the opposite direction. Give your kids honest, useful privacy information and watch them become deadly privacy ninjas - hope for a world in which citizens understand security and demand effective measures from their governments.</p> <p>\u2022 Cory Doctorow is a sci-fi author and editor of <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net\">boingboing.net</a>.

  "<p>The good news about the recession is that we can look forward to some great horror movies. The fright genre has traditionally flourished in straitened times. Weimar Germany, the Great Depression and the 1970s oil crisis all coincided, not so coincidentally, with new waves of innovative, inventive nightmare visions that hold up a mirror to their eras just as much as the po-faced social-realist dramas of the day. </p> <p>Of course, that mirror is cracked - all the better to reflect what's lurking beneath the surface. But what better way of suggesting an economy in freefall than the skewed world of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, devoid of reassuring angles or reliable narrators? It's a tale told by a madman, in a world gone mad. If you're looking for a sense of the moral chaos and uncertainty of the Depression, where better to find it than in the shambling creatures running amok through Frankenstein or King Kong? And how better to understand the decline of traditional family values than with Night of the Living Dead, in which loving brothers chow down on their siblings, mothers are devoured by their own children, young couples are roasted to death and heroes are killed by friendly fire? </p> <p>Horror movies have always been a way of addressing our most unspeakable fears and desires. Sometimes these are smuggled past our defences disguised as zombies or werewolves - not to slip one over on the censors (though there was that, too, back in the day) but because it's a way for us to absorb notions about death, decay and the human condition, which in their unadulterated forms would be just too vast, distressing or disgusting to contemplate. And maybe a tad boring, as well. Who wants grim tracts about drug addiction or sexually transmitted disease when you can see their effects just as powerfully, and far more entertainingly, acted out by the nomadic vampires of Near Dark? And who wants to see a serious movie about consumerism? Wouldn't you rather watch George Romero's 1978 film Dawn of the Dead, in which four people fend off flesh-eating zombies in a shopping mall? </p> <p>Nowadays, there seems to be more collective anxiety than ever for horror movies to tap into. For instance, feral youths torment nice young middle-class couples in Eden Lake and Them. In Cabin Fever, college graduates on a bucolic jaunt succumb one by one to the sort of flesh-eating bug that one can so easily pick up in today's hospitals. And 28 Days Later offers a vision of a Britain overrun by a virus that turns its inhabitants into fast-moving, flesh-eating zombies, only a few notches down from the rowdy binge-drinkers of tabloid cautionary tales.</p> <p>But horror doesn't thrive on realism, nor is it so easy to pin down. For every horror film that obviously seems to be \"about\" something, you can be sure there are even more insidious globs of unpleasantness bubbling away underneath - globs that can't be boiled down into neat newspaper headlines about hoodies, home invasion or the latest strain of killer flu.</p> <p>Advances in digital effects mean it's easier than ever for film-makers to slice and dice the human body, which make the excruciating, realistically depicted sufferings in \"torture porn\" movies such as Saw or Martyrs even harder to watch than the crude 1960s splatterfests of Herschell Gordon Lewis. But the results don't haunt your dreams - or at least not in the way their makers may have intended. Despite Eli Roth's glib attempts to pass off Hostel and Hostel: Part II as a response to the tortures of Abu Ghraib, I suspect what appeal such films may have to horror fans is more on a subliminal, quasi-religious level. These ghastly images are not so far removed from the agonies of The Passion of the Christ, or even the lingering, voyeuristic close-ups of Falconetti's tear-stained face in The Passion of Joan of Arc.</p> <p>The intricate death-dealing contraptions in the Saw and Hostel movies stirred up something in the back of my memory, but it was some time before I worked out exactly what they reminded me of - the paintings of Bosch and Breugel, where luckless sinners are impaled, dissected or burnt alive in elaborately conceived engines of infernal torture manned by demonic imps. It could be that \"torture porn\" caters purely to sadomasochistic tastes. Or maybe it's simply the latest rite of passage for teenagers keen to demonstrate their toughness by proving they can sit through the horrific images without fainting or throwing up. Or perhaps it's nothing less than a modern, secular substitute for the traditional idea of Hell. But it just goes to show there's more to any sort of horror movie than meets the eye.</p> <p>The most effective and disturbing horror movies don't set out to impress you with their clever allusions to current events. They try first and foremost to scare you silly. The Descent made me hyperventilate with fear, though I couldn't say whether that was due to the claustrophobia, the darkness, the blood, the flesh-eating foetus-like creatures or a combination of all these elements. And frankly, I'm not sure I want to know. Whether it was a hitherto unsuspected hatred of my body, or latent fear of giving birth to mutants, or being eaten alive by the underclass or something even more primal, I would rather leave it to my subconscious to deal with. </p> <p>Because horror movies tend to approach their themes more obliquely than other genres, they often succeed in getting under our skin where more self-consciously \"serious\" mainstream treatments of contemporary issues fail to cause a dent. Horror films draw on metaphors that are not polished and hermetically sealed, but misshapen or amorphous, like the monsters themselves, which leaves all the more room for individuals to interpret them on a personal level. For most people, Final Destination was a slasher movie in which a bunch of people narrowly avoid being killed in an exploding airplane and are subsequently picked off in freak accidents when Death, like a crazy accountant, attempts to balance its books. For me, though, it was a full-blown memento mori, perhaps not quite on a par with Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries or Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, but maybe not so far off. A nerve-jangling reminder that, any second, I could trip over the cat and accidentally stab myself in the carotid artery with a ballpoint pen, so I should probably take steps to make peace with my relatives or build a children's playground before that happened.</p> <p>The biggest bogeyman success story of the past 100 years has been that of the vampire, who, like any good predator, has moved with the times, swapping Bela Lugosi's tux and cape for the tight leather trousers of Blade or Underworld. The vampire's metaphorical reach has expanded to include sexuality, capitalism, disease, old age, drug addiction, alternative lifestyles and what have you. Most impressive of all, the sly bloodsuckers have infiltrated not just the nightmares but also the daydreams of alienated youth, who seem only too willing to invite them into their bedrooms and embrace them as fellow outsiders, romantic heroes or potential boyfriends. But vampires can take it; it's only when you start nudging them too far in a single direction, as Francis Ford Coppola did in Bram Stoker's Dracula by playing up the Count's search for true love (\"I have crossed oceans of time to find you\") that the mythology loses its bite and starts getting sloppier than a Mills &amp; Boon romance.</p> <p>Horror, like a person appointed as the keeper of humanity's dirtiest little secrets, remains the most despised and reviled of genres, one that has yet to be accorded even that limited measure of respect sometimes granted to thrillers or science fiction. On the one hand, horror movies are regarded with scorn, like a spotty teenage habit that needs to be outgrown. On the other, they provoke cries of outrage or demands for them to be banned as a corrupting influence, especially when tabloids are looking for a scapegoat or backbenchers are seeking publicity. But to stamp out the genre, as certain self-styled guardians of public morality would no doubt like to do, would be not just impossible, but psychologically dangerous. How else are we supposed to cope with our collective anxieties about terrorism, religious extremism, global warming, the underclass, the overclass, old age, sickness, the credit crunch and (if the wrong party gets elected into the White House next week) the End of Days?</p>",
  "<p>Polly Toynbee (The epic battle has begun. All Labour needs is an FDR, October 28) rightly berates the monetary policy committee for not reducing interest rates. But she (perhaps sarcastically) attributes the failure to do so now to \"personal pride\" of the MPC members. Unfortunately, the problem lies deeper. The MPC, excepting David Blanchflower, is made up of neoliberal class warriors. They believe that in a crisis of low profitability, monetary policy should be used to cut firms' wage costs: keep interest rates high, deflate the economy, increase unemployment, and thus get workers to accept real wage cuts and intensified work. In other words, Margaret Thatcher's strategy in 1980-81.</p> <p>The government, equally anti-worker, supports this policy. It is spared the embarrassment of having to argue for it by the independence of the MPC. A more progressive monetary policy, one aimed at ameliorating rather than exaggerating the recession, requires the government to immediately remove the MPC's independence and sharply reduce rates. But can tigers change their spots?<br><strong>Dr Jamie Gough</strong><br>Sheffield University </p> <p>If we are to spend our way out of a recession, it might be worth revisiting a Keynesian idea that predated John Maynard by almost a century. In a pamphlet published in the 1840s, entitled Distress, the Consequences of Capital: with Some Suggestions for the Establishment of a Refuge from the Extremity of Destitution for the Working Classes, my wife's Irish ancestor, Henry Calton Maguire, wrote: \"There is one gigantic enterprise ... that would ... immortalise the minister who gave it his consideration and support; and forever annihilate the sole political and statistical weakness this nation labours under. I allude to ... a physical union between Great Britain and Ireland, consequent on filling up the narrowest part of the channel between the two islands.\"<br><strong>Kit Hill</strong><br>Axminster, Devon </p> <p>So now it is China and the oil-exporting countries who, according to the prime minister, must play the leading role in preventing financial \"contagion\" from destroying \"vulnerable economies\" (Brown looks to China to strengthen IMF's hand, October 29). Not surprisingly, he omits to suggest that such countries should impose conditions in riding to the aid of the imploded financial systems of the US and Europe! </p> <p>Brown is in fact opening up new dimensions to the \"moral asymmetry\" (to use a polite term) of global policy initiatives launched from within the dominant western economies. When its balance of payments showed a massive surplus during the 1980s, the UK stood by while Mexico and a succession of other countries were subjected to the devastating conditionality of IMF rescue packages, with merciless disregard for the developing world to whom he now feels justified in calling upon for assistance.<br><strong> Dr Hugh Goodacre</strong><br>University College London</p>",
  "<p>Stately homes and ancient barns may creak and leak, but their locally sourced, sustainable technology is praised in a report published yesterday as a model for tackling climate change.</p> <p>Traditional coppicing and a device to supply power to the entire Yorkshire Dales village of Grassington are leading a return to green values by English Heritage, the National Trust and other guardians of the past.</p> <p>Studying the systems of country estates, which were often self-supporting until the industrial revolution, has triggered modern versions, backed by new technology and energy-saving equipment.</p> <p>\"We need to relearn the old wisdom of self-sufficiency and sustainability,\" said Maddy Jago, chair of the Yorkshire and Humber Historic Environment Forum, which is restoring the Dales hydroelectric plant, last used in 1946. Two Archimedes screws - historically used for pumping water upwards - will act as turbines to produce enough power for 100 local homes. \"This project alone will help the future of an important historic building, and contribute to reducing greenhouse gases and reliance on fossil fuel.\"</p> <p>A rollcall of imaginative schemes is listed in Heritage Counts 2008, English Heritage's annual report, which appeals to the government and local planners for more flexibility to encourage sensitive, sustainable adaptations of ancient buildings.</p> <p>The sector has welcomed a rise of a fifth in planning consents for careful change to conservation area properties, but is worried about falling heritage grants. In real terms, payments from the Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage have fallen by 27% since 2003 and are expected to drop a further 43% by 2013. </p> <p>The report was launched by EH's interim chair, Sir Barry Cunliffe, at the London Transport Museum, chosen because of its pioneering role as the first Grade II listed building to get large-scale solar panels. Cunliffe praised the former Covent Garden flower market's louvres, insulation and unobtrusive panels, which generate 16% of the museum's power.</p> <p>\"We must recognise that the reuse and recycling of older buildings such as this one is both responsible and sustainable,\" he said. \"Some of them are less energy efficient than newer buildings, but solutions exist, as the report shows.\"</p> <p>Case studies include medieval castles whose shivering occupants had not wised up to roof insulation made from sheep fleeces, but knew how to maximise a roaring fire with wide chimneys and precisely angled flues. The aristocratic practice of mothballing rooms during the winter is also being examined.</p> <p>Fiona Reynolds, director general of the National Trust, said: \"Historic buildings can be an important part of the solution to climate change, partly because they have been the first to encounter the challenge.\"</p> <p>Wider measures under way in a joint green package by the preservation bodies include the replacement of 40,000 lightbulbs in National Trust properties with energy-saving versions. The new bulbs will save 2,223 tonnes of carbon annually and cut energy and maintenance costs by an estimated \u00a3431,000 a year. Recycled wood ash from coppice fuel will be used on National Trust flower and vegetable borders.</p> <p>The Historic Houses Association is researching energy saving and alternative power sources.

  "<p>Through a telescope in the boardroom of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/financialtimes\">Financial Times</a> you can look out over the City of London; beneath this morning's clear blue sky stand the Natwest Tower, the Thames Exchange building and the Gherkin. Boats scud along the river. A man strolls its banks. I count the cranes on the horizon - said to be an indicator of a city's prosperity - and spot more than 20. Despite the news of global financial meltdown, there is, a pervading sense of business as usual.</p> <p>This is a strange moment for economic correspondents; in the past weeks they have been thrust from relative obscurity on to front pages and prime-time television. Already the financial crisis has made stars of the BBC's Robert Peston and Newsnight's Paul Mason, but for many the collapse's true luminary is Gillian Tett, assistant editor at the Financial Times, and one of the few people who predicted the current state of economic catastrophe, some two years ago. She sits in the boardroom in a smart boxy jacket, Prada sunglasses pushed back into her hair, making light of the sudden burst of attention. \"I think,\" she laughs briskly, \"it's the one moment in history when CDOs and CDSs become sexy!\"</p> <p>Collateralised debt obligation and credit default swaps, Tett's specialist subjects, have long been the dowdy end of finance, so there is a lick of satisfaction to their sudden prominence. \"On the one hand, it's gratifying that people realise just how significant all this activity is,\" she says, \"on the other hand it's horrific what happened. I mean we were sitting there a few years ago trying to tell people, 'Listen, if you don't take note of what's going on, the way that finance has changed so fundamentally, there is going to be an accident.'\" She says it firmly, the way a teacher might scold you for running in the corridor.</p> <p>Tett began looking at the subject of credit five years ago. \"Everyone was looking at the City and talking about M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions] and equity markets, and all the traditional high-glamour, high-status parts of the City. I got into this corner of the market because I passionately believed there was a revolution happening that had been almost entirely ignored. And I got really excited about trying to actually illustrate what was happening.\"</p> <p>Not that anyone particularly wanted to listen. \"You could see everyone's eyes glazing over ... But my team, not just me, we very much warned of the dangers. Though I don't think we expected the full scale of the disaster that's unfolded.\"</p> <p>There is something exceedingly calm and thorough about Tett. She talks with the patient enthusiasm of a Tomorrow's World presenter - a throwback, perhaps, to her days studying social anthropology, in which she has a PhD from Cambridge. \"I happen to think anthropology is a brilliant background for looking at finance,\" she reasons. \"Firstly, you're trained to look at how societies or cultures operate holistically, so you look at how all the bits move together. And most people in the City don't do that. They are so specialised, so busy, that they just look at their own little silos. And one of the reasons we got into the mess we are in is because they were all so busy looking at their own little bit that they totally failed to understand how it interacted with the rest of society.</p> <p>\"But the other thing is, if you come from an anthropology background, you also try and put finance in a cultural context. Bankers like to imagine that money and the profit motive is as universal as gravity. They think it's basically a given and they think it's completely apersonal. And it's not. What they do in finance is all about culture and interaction.\"</p> <p>Back in 2004, Tett asked a colleague to sketch her a map of the City to show how every part fitted together. \"Because one of the things I learned as an anthropologist is that to understand how a society works you need to not just look at the areas of what we call 'social noise' - ie what everyone likes to talk about, so the equity markets and M&amp;A and all the high-profile areas everyone can see. But you need to look at the social silences as well.\" When she looked at the map, she realised how much of the City was ignored.</p> <p>Tett's doom-mongering did not make her tremendously popular. Largely, her cautions were ignored, and when they weren't ignored they were subject to criticism. \"We had enormous kickback from the bankers in the City saying, 'Why are you being so critical of the industry? Why are you being so negative?' All that kind of stuff.\" On a trip to the economic forum Davos in 2007, she was even denounced from the stage. \"One of the most powerful people in the US government at the time stood up on the podium and waved my article, the article that predicted the problems at Northern Rock, as an example of scaremongering.\"</p> <p>But in 2007, people finally began to pay attention. \"I had been aware for two weeks that something very serious was building,\" she recalls. Tett was Japan correspondent for the FT during the country's financial collapse, and wrote a book about it, Saving the Sun. \"The behaviour and the psychological mood of the markets in late July was almost identical to what happened in the autumn of 1997 in Japan.\" The similarities worried her. \"I was busy cancelling holidays and things. But it came out of the blue for many people - investors, policymakers, bankers, our readers were suddenly completely at sea, at a loss to make sense of it.\" The financial system, she says, is \"so dysfunctional, so tribal, that people just don't communicate with each other\".</p> <p>At 41, Tett is too young to remember the financial crisis of 1974. She argues that this broad lack of understanding of what a recession looks like has been part of the problem for many in identifying the warning signs, though Britain's taste of economic downturn in the 90s has helped a little: \"At least we knew that could actually happen. America hadn't seen that at all.\"</p> <p>The strength of the City's PR machine has not helped either, she argues, nor has the secretive nature of that area of the financial industry, or the fact that many of the innovations made in the financial world in the last decade, while \"thoroughly sensible in principle\" had become \"completely perverted and taken to dreadful, nightmareish extremes. And that's partly because there was so little oversight.\"</p> <p>She assumes more than ever that the general public regard the City with \"fear and loathing\". Yet she suggests that our own attitudes to money need to be overhauled as much as the methods by which the City operates. \"People who come from a background of arts and humanities and social studies tend to think that money and the City is boring and somehow dirty,\" she says. \"But if you don't look at how money goes round the world you don't actually understand the world at all. When you try and join up the dots about how money can be linked to politics, can be linked to culture, then it's electrifying.\"</p> <p>She believes the nation needs to be educated in financial literacy, via community-based schemes in schools and through key community figures, such as midwives. In particular she hopes this might aid a greater economic understanding among women. One expects she feels this more keenly as a senior female financial journalist, and as the mother of two young girls (her husband, a former banker, now also works in financial education).</p> <p>\"Generally finance, maths, numbers, money, traditionally have not been seen as a female thing,\" she says. \"That's all about the culture of power. And one way that you keep women away from the power traditionally is that not only do they not own the money, control the money, but they don't understand the money. I feel very strongly about educating women about finance.\"</p> <p>It is of course our general bedazzlement in the face of the financial system that has made stars of Tett, Peston, Mason et al. \"It's a sign of how psychotic the financial climate is,\" she says. \"The British public is looking for answers, and Robert [Peston] is in the crossfire of that. He's visible and he's memorable and accessible, a character in a sea of dull bankers and bureaucrats.\" The financial crisis has made an unlikely star of Gordon Brown, too. Over in New York, says Tett, \"it's completely stunning, this Gordon Brown fanclub. He now walks on water.\" Does she approve of his handling of the crisis, or deem him guilty of mismanagement during his years as chancellor? \"Well,\" she says neatly, \"Gordon Brown, like every other western leader, was shockingly complacent and negligent in failing to understand what was driving the City. The British government was happy to enjoy the fruits of the boom, but it didn't ask the hard questions. That said, the American government has been worse, and, while for the last year the British government have looked like bumbling amateurs, against all the odds they've got their act together. The minute I saw the [bail-out] proposal on the table I did a double-take, because it seemed to me the first sensible response. It's not perfect, but ...\"</p> <p>Tett's move from social anthropology to financial journalism was not entirely planned. She was on work experience at the FT when the Soviet Union broke up. \"And they came around and said, 'Does anyone speak Russian?' I put my hand up, and I basically went from making the tea to writing pieces. Total Hollywood moment. Then the foreign editor comes round and says, 'There's going to be a revolution in Lithuania, does anyone want to go?' And I went, 'Yes! Me!\"</p> <p>She returned and joined the FT trainee programme. \"And they put me into the economics department.\" She pulls a face. \"Initially I thought, this is absolutely horrific!\" Her Damascene moment came one day when struggling to write about the foreign exchange market. \"I thought, you know what, this is just like being in Tajikistan. All I have to do is learn a new language. This is a bunch of people who have dressed up this activity with a whole bunch of rituals and cultural patterns, and if I can learn Tajik, I can jolly well learn how the FX market works!\"</p> <p>She spent a year in Tajikistan during her PhD. \"It's just next to Afghanistan and a very similar culture,\" she explains. \"I lived up in a very remote mountain village for a year, as a Tajik girl - wore Tajik clothes, spoke Tajik, looked after goats.\" So if things go totally wrong with the economy, she's got something to fall back on? \"Yeah,\" she laughs, \"I know how to milk a goat.</p> <p>\"It's a weird background to have,\" she continues. \"But it's helped me in covering the financial crisis. Having seen the Japanese financial crisis, I've always known that banks can fall apart. We never imagined that the Soviet Union would break up. And then in Tajikistan there was a horrific civil war. So that whole experience taught me that extraordinarily unexpected things can happen.\" She shrugs. \"To be really cynical, once you've lived through a really brutal civil war that's shattered your community and you're dealing with massacres and stuff, today's banking crisis is bad, but guess what ... it ain't that bad\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Saturday November 1 2008.

  "<p>Late October sunshine struggles to warm the chunky peninsula north of Edinburgh known as the Kingdom of Fife, where Pictish warriors once ruled and Gordon Brown grew up. Roads and railway platforms are gritted as biting northerly winds signal the onset of winter. </p> <p>Cold weather matters more than usual in Fife this year because some of the 66,000 Fifers who may vote next Thursday in the former mining constituency of Glenrothes are worried about their fuel bills.</p> <p>Brown's backyard byelection may also pass a verdict on the \"Brown bounce\" which has seen the prime minister's authority revived by his rescue of Scottish banks HBOS and RBS. </p> <p>The prime minister will risk making his second campaign visit today. In the Kingdom shopping centre - warm and dry - Sarah Brown was chatting to voters on Wednesday. Last week, her minders were overprotective; this week was better as Lindsay Roy, Labour's candidate, shepherded voters to her. </p> <p>\"This is Sarah. And this is Mr and Mrs McGregor. \" </p> <p>\"Hullo, I'm here to support Lindsay Roy on November 6. How are you?\"</p> <p>\"We live in sheltered housing.\"</p> <p>\"I hope they're treating you all right.\" </p> <p>\"Could be better.\" </p> <p>Mrs Brown smiles. She comes across as reserved, but it is a nice smile.</p> <p>Recession means job losses, not least in Fife's HBOS offices and call centres. But winter cold means an extra \u00a325 or so on average quarterly bills. \"The most powerful election leaflets in this campaign are energy bills reminding people that Labour has done little to help them with soaring energy bills this winter,\" Alex Salmond, the SNP's leader, keeps telling voters as he promises more fuel help than Labour.</p> <p>Glenrothes is a 1948 new town, one of Scotland's first. Its old coal-based industries died, but new ones (defence, electronics, council services) expanded, along with mature woods and masses of lush bushes. The constituency's overall unemployment, currently 5.1% and edging up, has halved since 1997. </p> <p>But it is worse in outlying villages, Victorian boomtowns with names such as Coaltown, and in decayed ports such as Methil and Leven, where recovery has been slower. The nearby Rosyth naval yard once employed 25,000; today not a tenth of that number work there. </p> <p>But Glenrothes feels prosperous and has become a nationalist stronghold. When Labour's John MacDougall was re-elected in 2005 in what was once a communist-held seat (1935-50), his majority was 10,664. He had 51.8% of the vote. \"Safe Labour seat,\" say the reference books. </p> <p>But the SNP's July byelection breakthrough in Glasgow East changed everything. Labour, the SNP and the bookies agree that November 6 (a 14% swing is needed) will be a close call.</p> <p>Brown's September bounce is not Salmond's only problem. For the first time, the SNP is in government: both at Holyrood since 2007 and on Fife's unitary council. It has an incumbent's record to defend and Fife council's SNP leader, Peter Grant, is the party's candidate for Westminster. If fuel and food bills are a local issue, so is the SNP-Lib Dem council's decision to raise social services charges. </p> <p>Pensioners' once-free alarms now cost \u00a351 a year; \u00a34-a-week care services are now \u00a311 an hour. Though it is actually more complicated, wheelchair demonstrators have harried Grant. So Labour morale is higher than it was. \"It's a mistake to have the council leader as your candidate,\" explains one Labour MP drafted in to help save the seat. </p> <p>But ex-accountant Grant sounds like Brown: dour, fact-filled and unrepentant. \"We inherited a council close to bankruptcy and have made a fantastic start,\" he says after a shopping-for-TV appearance in Aldi with Salmond's deputy, Nicola Sturgeon. \"You go into politics to make a difference. You become council leader and take responsibility. If people make mistakes, you back them,\" Grant says.</p> <p>Roy, a local headmaster and community activist, is different: a political novice, running as underdog. Activists picked him as a candidate more popular than his party. As he traipses around a grey estate at Methil he shakes hands with a white-van driver. \"I used to teach him,\" he says. </p> <p>There are Labour posters in Methil, where old mining solidarity lingers and voters remember that their last MP died of an industrial disease. Is it enough to sustain the Brown bounce? In the Kingdom's centre it is easier to find voters angry with the SNP council than with Brown. \"We've voted SNP for 40 years, but not this time,\" say an elderly couple, offended by the new charges. Both sides will be lucky to win. They know it.</p>",
  "<p>So George Monbiot (How these gibbering numbskulls came to dominate Washington, October 28) thinks that the American electorate and politics are ignorant, while presumably we British by implication are so intelligent and enlightened in ours. </p> <p>So whose electorate falls for the cynically spun illusion of million-pound tax-free inheritance gains, served up by George Osborne at last year's Tory conference? Which country clings to an outdated imperial system, and lionises luddites as \"metric martyrs\"? Which country's political class dare not speak of anything European except in terms of the UK dictating and the rest leading? Which capital city elected a mayor who is plainly unfit to hold public office on a resentment vote of car-owning, white, bourgeois suburbs against multi-ethnic, non-car-owning, urban gay and single-parent-family inhabited inner-city areas?</p> <p>The culture wars and dog-whistle politics of the US are sadly all too close to the UK, and perhaps no wonder since a large part of the media is controlled by an American citizen of Australian birth, who is more interested in pandering to prejudice, paranoia and resentment than promoting an informed and rational society.<br><strong>Tom Brown</strong><br>London</p> <p>While George Monbiot admirably lists many of the reasons for the degradation of US political intellectual standards, he misses another one: the marketisation of politics. If \"the business of America is business\" then everything is product - subject to manufacture, packaging and marketing - and political candidates and ideas are not exempt. American products have always been long on appearance but short on function, because US consumers have always been attracted to high-concept shiny objects; whether they work or not is of secondary interest. Thus the success of Reagan's \"shining city on a hill\" or Bush's \"thousand points of light\" or Bush Jr's \"compassionate conservatism\" - superb marketing, but of no substance whatsoever. Hockey Mom and Joe the Plumber, welcome to the sales shelf.<br><strong>Shel Khipple</strong><br>Wilmette, Illinois, USA</p> <p>A great weariness descended upon me when I read in reference to the US in George Monbiot's article that \"uniquely among the developed nations (with the possible exception of Australia), learning is a grave political disadvantage\". As an Australian who has lived in London for 12 years, I am constantly astonished at the amount of often undeserved criticism levelled at Australians by the British media. </p> <p>Australians recently elected, by an overwhelming majority, a Labor prime minister who is a fluent Mandarin speaker, an intellectual and former senior diplomat, and one who has so far demonstrated an unflinching commitment to human rights, indigenous Australians, a stable economy and the environment. Monbiot does himself a disservice with statements that are clearly out of touch with developments in contemporary Australia.<br><strong>Jennifer Higgie</strong><br>Co-editor, Frieze magazine</p> <p>In his excellent article, Monbiot cites lack of education as one reason why so many Americans vote for \"gibbering numbskulls\" such as Bush and Palin. </p> <p>Thomas Jefferson thought education was to guard \"the sacred deposit of the rights and liberties of ... fellow citizens\". Education \"illuminated the minds of the people, giving them knowledge of history so they could know ambition under all its shapes and prompt their natural powers to defeat its purpose\". Dangerous stuff, this education.<br><strong>Sally Weintrobe </strong><br>London</p> <p>George Monbiot rails against \"the domination of Washington by people who make a virtue of ignorance\", but his article is full of generalisations which threaten to do exactly the same thing: US citizens are \"stupid, and so suspicious of intelligence\"; \"religion - in particular, fundamentalist religion - makes you stupid\". Surely the best way forward for both sides of the debate is to recognise that people can hold different views without being caricatured as stupid or gibbering on the one hand, or as a smug crypto-communist on the other.<br><strong>Rob Baker</strong><br>Amersham, Buckinghamshire</p>",
  "<p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> closed up almost 50 points yesterday after a choppy day's trading that provided a subdued coda to Wednesday's bumper rally. The blue-chip index seesawed before settling at 4291.65, an increase of 49.11 and 1.16% on Wednesday. It was the FTSE's third successive day of gains, driven by strong performances from miners and banks. </p> <p><strong>Old Mutual</strong> was the FTSE 100's biggest gainer for the second day running, adding more than 18% or 9.2p to 60p.</p> <p>The advertising group <strong>WPP</strong> prospered despite reporting lower growth than predicted and warning that 2009 would be a \"very tough year\". Sir Martin Sorrell's group said it had not seen the post-Olympics \"Beijing bounce\" to the extent it had forecast.</p> <p>Collins Stewart analyst Gareth Thomas recommended selling the shares, warning that WPP \"has to climb a wall of downgrades\". But shares ended the day up 9%, climbing 31p to 363.5p.</p> <p>The day's biggest casualty was <strong>Admiral</strong>, whose shares slipped more than 17% or 190p to 900p. Analysts suggested the car insurance group had benefited from being seen as a safe haven but was now suffering as investors gained in confidence and switched into riskier stocks. </p> <p><strong>British American Tobacco</strong>, the world's second-biggest cigarette maker, fell 7% despite reporting a 17% rise in nine-month earnings and assuring investors that the global slowdown had had \"no discernible effect\" on its business. BAT shares have outperformed the FTSE by more than 40% this year, but yesterday they slipped 129p to \u00a316.90.</p> <p>Transport shares were in decline amid fears that the recession will dampen demand. Goldman Sachs analysts warned this week that sharp increases in unemployment \"would be particularly bad news for rail passenger volumes\". \"The greatest risk is to <strong>Stagecoach</strong>, due to its dependence on rail and in particular the sensitivity of its South West Trains franchise to financial-sector employment,\" they added.</p> <p>Panmure analyst Gert Zonneveld echoed these fears yesterday, as he cut his target price for Stagecoach from 260p to 205p. Shares in the company lost 8% or 15.3p to 176.9p, while <strong>FirstGroup</strong> fell 25.25p to 392p, <strong>Go-Ahead</strong> shed 109p to \u00a313.51, <strong>Arriva</strong> dropped 30.5p to 595p and <strong>National Express</strong> slipped 16.5p to 570p. </p> <p><strong>Unilever</strong> slipped 7p to \u00a313.36 after it reported a 8.3% rise in third-quarter underlying sales and upgraded its 2008 outlook, envisaging sales growth \"well in excess\" of its target. </p> <p>Shares in the Anglo-Russian miner <strong>Aricom</strong> more than doubled from 6p to 14p after the chief executive, Jay Hambro, said a railway bridge being built over the river Amur linking Russia and China could save the company almost $40m a year in freight costs.</p>",
  "<p>The Treasury is to use its power as part-owner of some British banks to demand that they rewrite their code on lending to business. Ministers want it clearly spelled out that banks must look at all other possible options before they make loan conditions more onerous. </p> <p>The current voluntary bankers' code for business, drawn up in March by the British Bankers Association, is thin and lacks details, Treasury sources said yesterday. </p> <p>The move is the latest in a series of government measures designed to ease the impact of the credit crunch on homeowners and businesses. </p> <p>Tighter codes have already been negotiated by the government on repossessions, and something similar is being considered for lending to business. MPs are reporting numerous stories of banks calling in loans or raising interest payments to as high as 15%, so increasing the likelihood of business failure. </p> <p>Revenue &amp; Customs is also looking at a range of administrative measures to ease the speed with which businesses have to make payments to the Inland Revenue.</p> <p>The moves came as Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling signalled they were losing patience with the banks over their reluctance to play their part in easing the lending crisis. </p> <p>The prime minister also hinted at possible tax measures, saying: \"I think you will see in the next few days us in a position to do more to help people face what is a global problem.\" </p> <p>There has been speculation that the government would announce tax cuts in the pre-budget report, as ministers continued to insist they were right to increase public spending to stave off a recession. </p> <p>Brown also kept up his international activity, hosting Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, at Downing Street where they agreed to press China and the Gulf states for a big cash injection into an IMF fund to bail out countries such as Hungary suffering from the credit crunch.</p> <p>Brown insisted that as a condition of bailing out the banks last month, there had been an expectation that they would continue to lend to small business at 2007 levels.</p> <p>In an attempt to put pressure on the banks, Darling told MPs at Treasury questions: \"We, on behalf of the taxpayer, have put a lot of money into the banking system because we recognise its importance.</p> <p>\"In turn, banks have to recognise the importance, not just to the country but to banks, of ensuring that small and medium-sized enterprises get the support that they need.\"</p>",
  "<p>After Cuba and Brazil, it's only right that Colombia should win recognition as one of the great powerhouses of Latin music. Two new compilations showcase the country's wildly varied styles. From the west coast, there's Pacifico Colombiano: Music Adventures in Afro-Colombia, which is more intriguing than the title would suggest. It's an easygoing set that features the African-influenced music of bands such as Grupo Naidy or Grupo Bahia, who have developed slinky, hypnotic styles based around marimbas, percussion and chanting vocals. Then there's Choc Quib Town, who mix folk themes with hip-hop, and Pacho Pe\u00f1a, whose lilting compositions are based around his trumpet work. </p> <p>The other compilation, Arriba la Cumbia!, is anything but laidback. Cumbia is the insistent, loping style that originated in Cartagena, up on Colombia's Caribbean coast, and is now a global dance craze. This set, compiled by DJ Russ Jones, segues between electronica, including new remixes by the likes of Basement Jaxx, and fine vintage accordion-backed songs from such classic performers as Alberto Pacheco. There are sadly few sleeve notes, but it's a great dance album.</p>",
