  "<p>With global capital losses so far totalling at least $1 trillion, and with these losses leading not only the US economy, but perhaps even the world economy, into recession, the blame game is now well under way. </p> <p>A first natural target is the risk managers in the commercial and investment banks. They sanctioned a range of unwise investments. Yet in many, perhaps most, cases their micro-level decisions followed due process. The problem was that the assumptions that underpinned their risk models were ceasing to hold - a classic illustration of the distinction between micro and macro analysis. Thus while some responsibility rests with the risk managers, that is not the full story. </p> <p>A second level of responsibility lies at the level of bank governance. A senior risk manager explained to me recently how he had been authorising property-based investments that, taken one by one, were good individual risks. But had he known his bank's total exposure, he would never have sanctioned these investments, at least in their totality. Clearly there is more to fix in the domain of corporate governance: yet responsibility does not stop there either. </p> <p>A natural target is the rating agencies, for failing to warn sufficiently of the risks that, in hindsight, have been seen so clearly. And they too are obviously part of the story. However, to hold them responsible for these capital losses is like blaming shopkeepers for inflation: while they bear some of the responsibility, they are scarcely the originating cause. </p> <p>Similarly with the regulators. Their shortcomings have become evident but it is clear that they were scrambling to understand a range of complex new exotic products whose properties had not been established, at least in times of stress. Perhaps the regulators should have disallowed them: but then only a few years ago people were uttering dire warnings about new derivative products and the phenomenal rise of the hedge fund industry. And, as Charlie McCreevy, the EU Commissioner for Internal Markets, has pointed out, these have stood up interestingly well, so far at least. </p> <p>Perhaps, therefore, it is the inventors of the exotic new financial products who should be blamed? Maybe. But they were responding to widespread investor desire for higher rates of return than, in a world of record-low bond yields and official interest rates, were obtainable from conventional instruments. </p> <p>Or maybe the real blame lies with the portfolio managers and their like who bought these products? After all, they are paid to assess risk relative to return. If they did not understand what they were buying, arguably they should not have bought. But theirs is a competitive industry: any investment manager who does not provide the full menu of products and returns stands to lose business - particularly now that investors are inundated with information about where to find the highest rates of interest, and investor capital is mobile at the squeak of a mouse. </p> <p>Perhaps, therefore, the real culprits were the central bankers? Arguably, they took interest rates too low, and held them there too long, following the dotcom collapse in 2000, and then 9/11, thereby fuelling excessive growth of liquidity. </p> <p>In other words, was the culprit Mr Greenspan's Fed? After all, it led the global rate-cutting cycle, and went the furthest. Moreover, it was the US that experienced the greatest housing boom, the greatest subsequent wealth losses, and is now seeing a construction industry slump that could last for years. </p> <p>Up to a point, Lord Copper. But remember that, in 2000, policymakers worldwide were preoccupied by the prospect of the US, and perhaps others, following Japan into deflation. Central bankers were not at all sure how, or even whether, they would be able to deal with that: it had already taken Japan 10 years to get out of deflation, and it was not certain that it truly had. </p> <p>Nevertheless, it could be argued that everything is the fault of the US, if only because its consumers have, depending on the year, saved little, nothing, or even less than nothing (by living on credit) at the same time as its government chose to prosecute a war while cutting taxes. All this has contributed to booming US imports and a current account deficit that has weakened the dollar, threatening the exports, and hence GDPs, of other economies. Again, maybe. </p> <p>But possibly, the top layer of blame belongs to the 1945 architects of today's international monetary system. At Bretton Woods, Britain's Lord Keynes argued for a world institution with authority to oblige both debtors and creditors - that is, in today's case, both the US and China - to change their policies. But the US, through Assistant Treasury Secretary Harry Dexter White, gave that plan short shrift. What emerged was little more than a fixed pool of national currencies and gold, administered by an IMF that was charged only with managing nations' trade deficits. </p> <p>So, over half a century later, has the real culprit been identified - a US Treasury Secretary who is, conveniently, long dead? Probably not. The key point to recognise is that the world is a complicated place. There is seldom, if ever, a single cause of anything, and certainly not in the world of economics and finance. </p> <p>What is vital now is to learn all the lessons from what has happened, and continues to happen. There will have to be reform at a great many levels, from the most micro to the most macro. And then it has to be hoped that, when all the new pieces have finally been fitted together, and the world economic engine starts to rev up again, all its new bits function well together, without the machine flying apart. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> John Llewellyn is Senior Economic Policy Advisor at Lehman Brothers</p>",
  "<p>The Irish government moved to shore up confidence in the republic's banking system yesterday by increasing its deposit guarantee scheme to \u20ac100,000 (\u00a380,000) per saver.</p> <p>Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said that raising the limit from \u20ac20,000 (\u00a316,000) was aimed at stabilising a financial system buffeted by world credit crunch pressures. Customers of Irish banks, building societies and credit unions will benefit. Lenihan said: 'The Central Bank and financial regulator have stressed the soundness and stability of the Irish financial system. This measure provides additional reassurance to depositors in Ireland that their savings are safe. The guarantee level is now among the highest in the EU.</p> <p>'The Irish government wants to protect the whole financial system, secure its stability and ensure that all deposits in Irish banks are safe.'</p> <p>As the republic tries to avoid recession, one of Northern Ireland's leading economists claimed yesterday that the province is the safest place during the present financial crisis. Mike Smyth, economic adviser to the power-sharing government at Stormont, said that Northern Ireland will continue to experience growth while other regions of the UK, and even the Irish Republic, tip into recession. </p> <p>In an interview with The Observer, Smyth, an academic at the University of Ulster, singled out the high level of public sector spending and employment as the main factor in making Northern Ireland 'recession-proof'. One in three jobs in Northern ireland is in the public sector.</p> <p>'Of course, our long-term future is contingent on Northern Ireland shifting its economy away from public-sector domination to the private sector, to an economy based on selling things on the global market,' added Smyth.</p> <p>'But the irony about the present crisis is that the large public-sector building projects that are already under way will offset any job losses in private-sector house-building. Which in turn means that spending power in the population will be shored up.'</p> <p>He pointed to a number of major infrastructure projects either already started or about to begin, as examples of how the local economy will grow rather than contract. These include the extension of the motorway from Belfast into the west as far as the Clogher Valley, and its link-up with a motorway from the republic all the way to Derry. </p> <p>'I predict that through 2008 we will end up with about 0.5 per cent growth, which although a fall from the 2.7 per cent growth we experienced in 2007, is still not like the situation nationally where the UK economy could dip into negative growth,' he said.</p> <p>'In the short term, during this crisis, the republic has been, and will continue to be, harder hit by the global loss of confidence. Their economy rocketed because of foreign investment, especially American capital. If the Americans leave, they are in trouble.'</p> <p>The moves come as details emerge of widespread fraud at some of Britain's biggest lenders. Ten banks and building societies have called in the police to investigate systemic and sophisticated mortgage fraud worth more than \u00a360m, The Observer has discovered. Bradford &amp; Bingley alone has written off \u00a315m to criminal gangs who organised frauds involving applications from dishonest or bogus borrowers. Police believe a number of shady brokers and solicitors overstated the value of houses.</p>",
  "<p>Their plight captured the world's imagination as they fought for their natural homeland. The Kalahari Bushmen's battle to retain the nomadic lifestyle they have enjoyed for thousands of years amid the arid sands of the great Kalahari desert, is one of the most emotive in modern-day Africa. </p> <p>But the beleaguered Basarwa people have now been dealt another blow. Devastating fires have destroyed almost all of the huge Central Kalahari Game Reserve. For the past two weeks flames have swept through 40,000 sq kilometres of dry grassland laying waste to 80 per cent of the reserve, an area twice the size of Wales. </p> <p>For those Bushmen still managing to live by hunting game and gathering roots and tubers inside the reserve, it threatens their survival in this most inhospitable of terrains as the flames consume vital vegetation and drive wildlife away.</p> <p>The Tsamma wild melons, which provide a vital source of hydration for the Basarwa nomads, are being lost to the fires. Human rights group Survival International, which is monitoring the situation, said: 'The fire is advancing across the dry grassland in the northern part of the reserve and destroying wild melons which provide a vital source of water for the Bushmen during this very dry season.</p> <p>It is a cruel setback for the Basarwa, who are thought to be one of the oldest cultures in the world, dating back thousands of years, who in 2006 finally won the right to return to their ancestral land after Botswana's High Court ruled they had been illegally evicted by the government. The Central Kalahari Game Reserve, believed to be home to around 250 truly nomadic Bushmen, is one of the world's largest wildlife reserves. Its spectacular biodiversity, including desolate plains, ancient riverbeds and salt pans, has made it a favoured tourist destination. The wilderness area is also home to thousands of species, including giraffes, hyenas, lions, cheetahs, leopards and rare wild dogs. </p> <p>It is understood the fires have avoided the Basarwa settlements, and there are no casualties. But the seriousness of the situation has only just been acknowledged by the Bostwanan government, prompting allegations of a cover-up to protect the country's vital tourist industry. </p> <p>Edmund Moadi, deputy permanent secretary in the Ministry of Environment, Wildlife and Tourism, said the major fires had now been extinguished. But he admitted that they had been the worst for many years, partly because last season's record rainfall had produced lush vegetation that provided fodder for the flames. </p> <p>Botswana's lack of fire-fighting resources had made it difficult to cope with a blaze on such a scale. 'In terms of aeroplanes, we do not have any,' Moadi said.</p> <p>'We rely on community volunteers, the army and police force - anyone who can do a bit of firebeating. But the job is difficult because the heat is intense in the daytime and you have to work by night when it is cooler but visibility is poor.'</p> <p>The mainly flat reserve - which has no permanent habitation, just a scattering of campsites - is normally covered with bush and grasses and areas of larger trees. Among the inhabitants unique to the reserve are the barking geckos, which limit their day to a few cool hours of the evening. </p> <p>Forty kilometres north of the fossilised river, staff at the luxury Deception Valley Lodge on the boundary of the reserve said yesterday that disturbing amounts of smoke and smog had swept over their area but had now subsided.</p> <p>Assistant camp manager Nadia Fourie said: 'We get our news from chance encounters at the veterinary fence and our information is that the fire has passed an area 80 kilometres from us.' The reserve was originally established by the Bechuanaland colonial government in 1961 to protect not the wildlife but the Basarwa. The Bushmen had been brought to world fame by Laurens van der Post's BBC documentary series and book, The Lost World of the Kalahari. Van der Post described the Basarwa - which means 'those without cattle' - as the original natives of southern Africa who represented the 'lost soul' of all mankind. </p> <p>Their image has remained vivid in Western imaginations, prompting an outpouring of support when the government of Botswana began relocating them in the Nineties.</p> <p>The government - which blocked the Basarwa's main borehole in the centre of the park - claimed that it could not guarantee their welfare in the vast reserve. But after an exploration deal was signed with diamond mining firm De Beers, rumours spread that the government wants to clear the park to allow for diamond extraction - something it strenuously denies.</p> <p>In 2006, the Botswana High Court ruled that the eviction of up to 4,000 Basarwa from the reserve was illegal. But Survival International claims that the government has done little to help them return to the park, leaving them instead to live in squalid resettlement camps on its fringes. In Gantsi, the closest town to the fire, district commissioner Jefferson Siamisang, said the area affected 'is a huge, huge chunk of land', explaining that 'while flying over in a helicopter we have not seen any wildlife deaths yet. The animals have moved to desert areas or salt pans. But the vegetation, which offers shelter from the scorching desert heat and grazing, has been greatly affected. Vegetation is their source of life. The wildlife will struggle.'</p> <p>He added that the causes of the fires were unknown and that some had started outside the park.</p> <p>Moadi denied that the government had attempted to conceal the seriousness of the situation. 'The fires took us by surprise and we have been busy putting them out,' he said. 'In the next few months, we will learn from this year's experience.</p> <p>'For instance, plans are in place to improve firebreaks in affected areas. The major fires are out now, but one cannot say the problem is over until the rainy season starts, hopefully in October, but maybe November.'</p> <p>He denied that the Basarwa had been affected by the blaze.</p> <p>'Fortunately the areas burnt are not those where there are settlements,' he said.</p>",
  "<p>David Miliband has criticised the 'abuse of market power' by failing executives who pay themselves fat salaries, in what is being seen as a bid to woo the left during Labour's leadership crisis.</p> <p>The first insight into his views on the growing pressure to tackle City greed comes in an interview for the October issue of the current affairs magazine Prospect, to be published the day after the Prime Minister's make-or-break conference speech. </p> <p>The Foreign Secretary suggested that he had not given up hope of introducing a form of carbon rationing, which would price consumers out of gas-guzzling cars and cheap flights by giving every citizen an annual carbon quota. </p> <p>Miliband championed personal carbon trading as Environment Secretary but the plan was ditched after Gordon Brown became leader. In his interview, however, Miliband said 'the whole point about good ideas is that they don't die'.</p> <p>The lengthy exposition of his views, over 11 pages, marks the first glimpse of the potential policies of a Miliband leadership bid on the eve of the annual party conference, which will see Brown and his rival pitched against each other in a battle for Labour hearts and minds. </p> <p>Unlike previous years, there are no real ideological arguments dividing delegates gathering in Manchester today: no epic battles over privatisation, nor Iraq, nor pensions. It's worse than that. 'The only issue is the leadership: is Gordon up to it?' says a government aide. </p> <p>After 10 days of clumsy plotting left him wounded but not dispatched, Brown has earned a temporary reprieve. The one thing more toxic to Labour MPs than their leader is a City meltdown threatening jobs, savings and pensions. Squabbling now would look petty. </p> <p>Besides, even some backbenchers anxious to overthrow Brown would rather suffer him than join some of the plotters who surfaced last week. They have not forgotten how Siobhan McDonagh's sister Margaret, when party general secretary, tore into those straying off-message, or how Jim Dowd enforced discipline as a whip. 'Wrong people, wrong plot, wrong time,' says one senior backbencher who shares the rebels' doubts about Brown. </p> <p>But the insurrection is only suspended, not quashed. Brown's task this week, according to one cabinet minister, is to 'give them confidence', to show he is a going concern. Can Brown, whose impassioned sermons from the conference pulpit once stirred Labour souls, make his party believe again? And if not, will they put their faith in Miliband ?</p> <p>The leader's speech is still enduring interminable redrafts but, helped by allies including Miliband's minister brother Ed, it is taking shape. It is Brown's response to the global banking crisis that will dominate. None the less aides are worried that expectations have risen impossibly high - and that critics have only gone quiet so they can say they gave Brown a fair hearing before damning him. 'Even if it's Martin Luther King, some people will say it wasn't enough,' says one Downing Street staffer.</p> <p>Brown has taken no chances. Apart from Alistair Darling, other cabinet ministers will have just six minutes for their platform speeches, after which they must take delegates' questions. Miliband will barely have time to clear his throat. </p> <p>Which explains why the Foreign Secretary is popping up everywhere else. Yesterday's Times was invited into his Primrose Hill kitchen, to chat about his schooldays and his marriage: he told yesterday's Daily Mirror how he took time out to escort his son to nursery. The only topic now off limits is the leadership campaign: officially at least, as he told the Mirror: 'There isn't a vacancy.' But there is a vacuum, and Miliband fills it. He will star at tonight's rally organised by the Blairite think-tank Progress; he will also deliver a lecture today for the Fabian Society, campaigning for higher taxes for the rich. In his Prospect interview he ducked questions about tax, but said it was impossible to care about poverty without 'caring about the gap [between rich and poor]'.</p> <p>And he acknowledged public anger at executives who did not justify their pay: 'The gap between the chief executive and the average salary on the shopfloor has exploded, and this is a reflection less of market forces and more of moral norms. What really hacks people off about some of the top 0.1 per cent is when they get extra for underperformance. People want checks and balances that discipline the abuse of market power.'</p> <p>If such flashes of political ankle can convince the grassroots he is not a Blairite throwback, then last week's shambolic revolt may gain what it critically lacked: a purpose. </p> <p>Conspiracy theories about the failed uprising that began with McDonagh's sacking for requesting papers to nominate an alternative leader are still flying in Manchester. Could Hazel Blears, whose unsuccessful deputy leadership campaign was backed by several of the plotters, be behind it? </p> <p>Perhaps - except that David Cairns, the Scottish minister who emerged from obscurity last week to resign, is not close to Blears - and her close ally, the MP Steve Pound, condemned the plot. As for the network of Blairites running the Progress group, while some did speak to rebels, the advice was that their tactics were ineffective. </p> <p>The revolt failed because it lacked a mastermind and a candidate, leaving McDonagh, Cairns, Labour's vice-chair Joan Ryan and others sacrificing their jobs in vain while the cabinet nervously sat tight. 'You shouldn't send troops into a war you can't win when you don't have a general,' says one government source.</p> <p>In Downing Street none the less, the mood is described as 'desperately grim'. Cabinet ministers openly scoff at the 'dysfunctional' centre of government. MPs wonder why Brown did not just call the rebels' bluff, send nomination papers to all MPs and dare them to act, assuming that Miliband lacked the numbers and the nerve to mount a real challenge now. What is missing is leadership. And it came from an unexpected source. </p> <p>With a glittering guest list from the music mogul Simon Cowell to footballer Sol Campbell, last July's auction of sporting memorabilia in aid of Labour successfully pried open supporters' wallets. But it may have raised something more valuable: for a plot began here to save Labour from itself.</p> <p>Alastair Campbell and John Prescott, both hawking themselves as prizes, spent the evening sharing their frustrations at the party's unravelling. The result was their 'Go Fourth' campaign for a Labour fourth term, launched last week with Prescott's friend Richard Caborn and Glenys Kinnock, in an article for the New Statesman magazine barely mentioning Brown. This is about saving a party, not a leader.</p> <p>The baton was picked up on Friday by Martin Salter, the Labour MP for Reading West, a veteran rebel irritated enough by the plotters to call Campbell. Now he is circulating a letter to MPs urging them to pledge to 'actively support' and defend the government. It is backed by mainstream MPs from the left-wing kingmaker Jon Cruddas to minister Joan Ruddock. Signing - or not signing - is fast becoming a test of loyalty. </p> <p>None the less too many backbenchers are publicly despairing, too many ministers privately resigned, for such sticking plasters to hold. A cabinet minister suggests Brown may only have nine months left - up to June's European elections: the joke is that Labour is more likely to come fourth than 'Go Fourth'. </p> <p>And after Brown yesterday took credit for the City's astonishing recovery, he may get the blame if it crashes again. The Tories will use their own party conference to blame the crisis directly on his approach as Chancellor, a charge some Labour MPs fear may be justified.</p> <p>It is a sign of his continued fragility that nobody is now sure Brown's long-awaited cabinet reshuffle - pencilled in for early October - will even happen. He certainly cannot afford to provoke anyone by moving Miliband. </p> <p>More likely are smaller changes, sharpening the cabinet's attacking edge. Brown has long itched to combine the three 'regional' cabinet ministers for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland into one cabinet post, a probable promotion for Europe minister Jim Murphy. </p> <p>Murphy is not the only ex-Blairite rising: Shaun Woodward, the Northern Ireland Secretary and ex-Tory defector, is tipped for promotion to a political role co-ordinating the election fightback in which he could use his inside knowledge against David Cameron. Meanwhile Ruth Kelly, the devoutly Catholic Transport Secretary, is agonising over whether to back the government's bill on embryo research in Parliament next month or quit.</p> <p>But individual fates matter less in the face of today's poll, which suggests that unless someone turns it around Labour will be cast into the wilderness at the next election. There is talk of a profound realignment of politics, the death of New Labour: like the Lehman bankers cast out with their belongings in cardboard boxes, Labour could lose everything.</p> <p>Which means that while Brown's stock has rallied, the threat of hostile takeover looms.</p>",
  "<p>Small companies hoping to cash in on the London Olympics are being warned they face a 'time bomb' in the run-up to the 2012 Games because so few of them understand the advertising perils surrounding the event.</p> <p>Under the 2006 London Olympic Games and Paralympics Games Act, normally innocuous words such as 'Game', 'Medals', 'Gold', '2012' and 'Summer' cannot be combined in any form of advertising around the Olympics, with anyone flouting the law facing a fine of up to \u00a320,000.</p> <p>But the Chartered Institute of Marketing, the international body for marketing and business development, says few marketers appreciate the constraints of the legislation and face 'a rude awakening' when they discover they have broken the law. </p> <p>In a paper to be published this week the body attacks the act as 'draconian', warning: 'An advertisement for sun tan lotion, for example, with the strapline \"Get bronze in 2012\" would be found to be in contravention of the Listed Expressions element of the Act.'</p> <p>David Thorp, director of research and information at the CIM, said: 'With sponsorship limited to a select few global brands the vast majority of UK plc is likely to miss out.'</p> <p>The legislation is based on that used for the 2000 Sydney Games, created to protect official sponsors' investments, and is a requirement for any Olympic host nation.</p> <p>Ambush marketing, where rival firms not contributing sponsorship hijack others who have, has long been a problem for Olympic authorities.</p> <p>Perhaps the most blatant example of this was when British sprinter Linford Christie, in Atlanta, turned up at an official press conference sporting striking contact lenses bearing the logo of Puma, not official sponsors.</p>",
  "<h2>Eddie's rallying cry backfires rather</h2> <p>This is not the first time that Prince Charles has shown views differing from those of his younger brother, Prince Edward, but it's one that Ted should have seen coming. </p> <p>This weekend, 50 cars are taking part in a very smart rally that has been organised by Bentley, which departs from Windsor Castle and ultimately arrives in Florence, having taken in some of Europe's more tranquil countryside and a couple of the continent's better Formula 1 tracks en route, as well as providing those who are taking part with the chance to eat and drink in grand style. </p> <p>The event is raising money for the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme, and Prince Edward himself showed up to 'inspect' participants before they set off. It costs a mere \u00a314,500 per car to take part. It is not, however, very eco-friendly. Indeed, it has been expressly criticised by the organisers of the Revolve Eco-Rally, which is supported by the Prince of Wales, who last year launched the very green event. </p> <p>'It is more a case of the message it puts out than actual damage it causes,' says Revolve's director, Steven Glaser. 'It needlessly encourages having fun at the environment's expense. The Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme is all about people fulfilling their potential, but part of that must be ensuring they don't inherit a ruined planet.' This view is shared by other ecological campaigners. </p> <p>Andrew Charalambous, who is setting up the Conservative Climate Campaign with the likes of Zac Goldsmith and Tory environment spokesman Greg Barker, adds: 'There are better ways to raise money. </p> <p>'We don't say that people shouldn't drive or shouldn't fly, but doing it for leisure is a different matter. This sort of thing should be avoided.'</p> <h2>Doesn't 'cost-cutting' mean trying to spend less, Boris? </h2> <p>Boris Johnson has publicised 'cost-cutting' since becoming Mayor of London. Now I'm told he's invited tenders for 'well-being workshops' to support staff in dealing with the cuts he's making. Isn't this the sort of thing he's supposed to find ridiculous? Meanwhile, the mayor's writer sister Rachel told me, at a party to celebrate the relaunch of Reader's Digest, that her publishers turned down her first suggestion for a new book, which was to be called Hell's Belles, a prequel to her previous romans-\u00e0-clef, Notting Hell and Shire Hell, so she's writing something set in 1938 instead. Good news for the Notting Hill Tories satirised in the first two books.</p> <h2>Dave Cameron and the enemy within</h2> <p>Alongside tomes such as Social Responsibility: The Big Idea by David Cameron, the Tory party's online bookshop is taking orders on Quentin Letts's forthcoming book 50 People Who Buggered Up Britain. Peculiar, as among those demolished by the Daily Mail sketchwriter are Lady Thatcher, Edward Heath, Kenneth Baker, Nicholas Ridley and other former and current Conservative MPs. While Dave Cameron may agree with at least some of these, it's not wise to advertise the fact to his core supporters, as I thought he'd already learnt.</p> <h2>Do as we teach, not as we does, says Harrow School</h2> <p>Much publicity last week for Harrow School for the rigid grammar test sat by sixth-form pupils. One of the questions asked boys to pick the correct words in the following sentence: 'Anyone who sees this film will find their/his/her hair standing on end.' You will remember that 'anyone', being singular, should not be followed by 'their'. But what of Harrow's headmaster? In his letter to prospective parents on the school's website, he writes: 'If you were to ask a Harrow parent why they chose us for their son, they would tell you ...' He was not available when I rang, but the teacher responsible for the test points out, diplomatically, that 'language is a living creature'.</p> <h2>Always back the winning team</h2> <p>Last summer, Tom Cowie announced he'd be giving no more money to the Conservatives because Dave Cameron was 'an arrogant old Etonian' in whom he was 'very, very disappointed'. How times change. I'm told the industrialist, whose Cowie Group was the forerunner of the travel multinational Arriva, has since given another \u00a325,000. I called to find out what had brought about this change of heart - it presumably wasn't the Tory leader's disclosure that Samantha Cameron had (briefly) been to a 'day school' - but he wasn't keen to talk. Could it be because since last year, it's become increasingly likely that Dave will be our next PM?</p> <h2>Look who's in the frame </h2> <p>Friends of Poju Zabludowicz tell me the art-collecting millionaire is considering a bid for Newcastle United. He was interested last time around (his wife Anita is from the city) before Freddy Shepherd decided to sell to Mike Ashley, who is now looking to offload the club. Zabludowicz declines to comment.</p> <h2>Well, that's easy for you to say, Jools</h2> <p>Jools Holland's televised love-in with Carla Bruni, was much remarked upon last week, so it's endearing to note the lengths to which the presenter went to ensure it ran smoothly. Throughout the show, there was a woman standing in front of him holding a big whiteboard with the names of the performers and a few sentences on it. All the bands' names were spelt correctly, apart from the French First Lady's, which was written phonetically as 'Carla Broonee'.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:pendennis@observer.co.uk\">pendennis@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Outside Lehman Brothers headquarters near Times Square a grim-faced man carrying a yellow placard urged a growing crowd of onlookers to repent their sins and turn to Jesus or prepare to meet the end of the world.</p> <p>For once, the bankers - some of them ex-bankers - passing hurriedly through the revolving glass doors looked like they believed him. Some even took his leaflet and stared at the prediction on the cover with terror.</p> <p>It was a good week for prophets of doom. Not so for bankers. David Z - he declined to give his last name - ignored the religious zealot as he pushed his way through the onlookers on 7th Avenue at 49th Street last Tuesday and stopped to preen himself mockingly before one of the many TV cameras eagerly seeking some hysterical former traders to film.</p> <p>But David was one of the lucky ones who had kept his job, at least for now, and was hopeful that another firm would step in and buy the division that housed his advisory unit. Given that he was not tearing his hair out or screaming his despair to the heavens, most of the media ignored him and looked for better quarry. Had they bothered to talk to him, they would have learnt that there was a growing chance that Barclays of the UK was going to buy much of Lehman's investment banking businesses and that the job losses in New York might be far fewer than the Cassandras expected.</p> <p>They would also have discovered how chaotic it was on Monday inside the Lehman HQ - a glass and steel monstrosity emblazoned with three-storey TV screens displaying 'Lehman' on a hypnotic fiery background. 'Seriously, on Monday morning it was like Bellevue in there,' David said, referring to the notorious New York psychiatric hospital. </p> <p>As workers arrived just hours after the news broke that the Fed would not lend the investment bank a hand but would allow it to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, traders were tearing down expensive artwork from the walls.</p> <p>Those with a more profit-focused outlook were selling on eBay whatever they could with the firm's logo on it. There were unverifiable reports of one trader urinating on his PC while screaming obscenities, but the employees I spoke to had only heard about it; no one had seen it happen.</p> <p>But, in a turn of events that could only happen in New York, open-top buses began pulling up outside Lehman depositing their payloads of snap-happy tourists on to the already busy pavement to take pictures of a big tower block.</p> <p>'On your left,' the tour guide intoned through a crackly microphone, 'is the famous Lehman Brothers building', before going on to give an approximate history of the credit crunch. The tourists seemed to love it, in much the same way as peasants used to love a good hanging.</p> <p>But the Lehman collapse was just the first in an endless stream of historic events on Wall Street last week that have brought about the kind of fundamental changes in global finance that come along only once in a lifetime.</p> <p>Almost in lockstep with Lehman's collapse, Merrill Lynch declared an emergency merger with Bank of America. At a stroke, John Thain, the Merrill chief, had mapped out the future for the big beasts of Wall Street, and the once-revered Masters of the Universe who ran them. No more will investment banks be able to afford the existence they had carved out for themselves - an independent and charmed life financed by vast borrowing way beyond their means. </p> <p>Thain basically admitted that Merrill, pregnant with billions of dollars of sub-prime mortgage debt, had to rush to the altar for a shotgun wedding with Bank of America. Perhaps just as importantly, he was admitting that the days of the omnipotent and ego-driven Wall Street chief executive were over, too. Dick Fuld, the CEO of Lehman who allowed the bank to go down the tubes, was perhaps the ultimate example of such a titan.</p> <p>Merrill staff were harder to pin down than Lehman people. But my own financial adviser at the bank, who also declined to be named for fear of breaking company rules, said that the atmosphere was generally calm with everyone grateful the merger had been struck. Most were confident their jobs would be safe because they were the prized New York-based financial advisers that Bank of America in effect bought for $50bn.</p> <p>AIG workers were not so lucky, as the US government stepped in with an $85bn bridging loan in exchange for a 79.9 per cent stake in the insurer. The government is looking for buyers for much of the profitable side of the business to pay the loan back. 'People are happy that the government saved the company from collapsing, but very worried about which divisions will get sold and which might still close down to save money,' the Merrill financial adviser said.</p> <p>As the week wore on, almost every aspect of the Wall Street way of life was changing before our eyes. Share prices of the world's biggest banks were tumbling by 30 and 40 per cent a day, adding up to 50 and 60 per cent in the month alone. This not only exerts immense pressure on the banks themselves - and makes raising money to pay the bills next to impossible - but drains the personal wealth of tens of thousands of bankers down to almost worthless levels. The days of Bonfire of the Vanities-style cocaine binges or driving high-class escorts from the office to the yacht are over - if they ever existed. More prosaically, the huge houses in Westchester, ridiculously expensive rented summer homes in the Hamptons and private schools for the kids may also be at risk.</p> <p>A lot of bankers, traders and financiers are paid their big bonuses in special stock awards. Chief executives and their ilk receive almost all of their massive pay packets in the form of options and restricted stock of some sort. Many invested a great deal of their cash in more stock, so confident were they of making greater and greater returns.</p> <p>All that has come to a jolting halt. Look at Hank Greenberg, the former boss of AIG - indeed, the man who built the vast and complex financial services firm from a small insurance outfit. Analysts reckon he lost $3bn in the course of a couple of days last week. </p> <p>'I've lost literally my entire net worth,' he said. 'I worked 40 years building the greatest insurance company in history, one everyone in the world envied.' He still has his own private jet though, so he must have something stashed away for a rainy day - about $28m by most accounts.</p> <p>As the share price slide continued, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the last two standalone investment banks, came under pressure to find a partner and join the new order. Goldman pooh-poohed talk of its demise but Morgan opened merger talks with US high-street bank Wachovia, while simultaneously going cap-in-hand to CIC, its Chinese silent partner, looking for cash.</p> <p>But last Thursday night, as regulators and politicians turned on short sellers of financial stocks, blaming them for the week's events, the Dow Jones Industrial Average suddenly leapt more than 400 points. Its biggest gain in six years was fuelled by rumours swirling through the market of yet more government intervention.</p> <p>And then came the biggest number of all, the true grand finale of the week. On Friday morning Hank Paulson called an emergency press conference to announce the biggest US government bailout in history. It will cost the American taxpayer hundreds of billions of dollars and see all the toxic sub-prime related mortgage debt in the US dumped on the government's shoulders.</p> <p>The taxpayer may be on the hook for as much as half a trillion dollars if this scheme goes ahead - but as Paulson himself warned, the cost will be much greater if we have to endure many more weeks like the past one.</p>",
  "<p>There will be three speeches from the cabinet that matter at the Labour conference in Manchester. The least important of those three will be Gordon Brown's performance on Tuesday. Maybe he really will deliver up The Speech Of His Life. Perhaps an astonished nation and a gobsmacked party will find that he is suddenly endowed with the charisma of Obama, the tongue of Demosthenes, and the poetry of Shakespeare. Even in that unlikely event, a single speech is not going to make him a changed man nor will it greatly change opinions about him.</p> <p>One more speech from Mr Brown is not going to transform either his personal position or his party's bleak prospects. Even his residual allies don't believe that. As one of them said to me the other day: 'No one thinks one speech can make everything rosy again.'</p> <p>There could be no better illustration of the depths of Labour's predicament than Downing Street's ambiguous attitude towards the most seismic quake in the financial markets since the Great Crash of 1929. A great unravelling of the banking system should normally terrify Number 10. This financial tsunami has been gratefully grabbed at as some sort of relief from the crisis over Mr Brown's leadership. He and his remaining allies have seized on it to make the argument that it would be irresponsible folly of the highest order for the Labour party to choose this as the moment to try to topple the Prime Minister.</p> <p>Yet I still find Labour MPs short-selling Brown in the belief that the Prime Minister has become an insolvent entity beyond rescue by the Bank of England or the Treasury and must eventually go bust. That despair within Labour's ranks can only be made more profound by the devastating findings of the monster poll of marginal seats for PoliticsHome.com about which I write elsewhere in today's Observer</p> <p>We have heard this argument before, the argument that a leader cannot be removed at a time of international crisis. The same was said in the weeks leading up to the defenestration of Margaret Thatcher by the Tory party in 1990. In response to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, thousands of British troops were encamped in the desert that autumn waiting for the order to begin Operation Desert Storm. Mrs Thatcher's allies argued with their party that they couldn't possibly move against this global stateswoman at a time of such peril. But Tory MPs struck her down anyway. She was booted out of Number 10 before Saddam was kicked out of Kuwait. In Mr Brown's shoes, I wouldn't rely on the turmoil in the financial markets to save my skin for very long.</p> <p>His best protection from a coup at the moment is the lack of a clear alternative offering a plausible lifeboat for the Labour party to leap into. There will be many in Manchester looking for that alternative because there is absolutely no doubt that Mr Brown is a huge negative for his party. He is greatly disliked by swing voters, the potential switchers who are the people Labour has to win back from other parties if the government is to have any hope of recovery. The poll finds that many of these voters might be persuaded to switch back to Labour by a change of Prime Minister.</p> <p>Before that can happen, the Labour party first needs to be convinced that a change of leader would do it more good than harm. It is a very big deal to remove a Prime Minister. It will also be a very gory deed if Mr Brown insists on being dragged away from the job with his torn fingernails clinging to the doorframe of Number 10. Plenty of people in the Labour party - up to and including much of the cabinet - have given up on him. If they could be reasonably sure that someone else would do better, Mr Brown might already be an ex-Prime Minister. Which means that the conference will be scanning the cabinet to see if anyone around that table possesses the imagination, the inspiration and the ideas to turn things around. Most scrutiny will focus on two men: David Miliband and Alan Johnson. The question asked of them is whether they have what it takes to restore Labour's fortunes - or, at least, to mitigate the electoral apocalypse that currently faces the party.</p> <p>The Health Secretary has many of the qualities that are lacking in Mr Brown. Mr Johnson can speak human. He is an adept communicator with an attractively conversational and humorous style on the telly. He has a biography - brought up in a council flat by his sister, failure at school, postman, modernising union leader, likeable minister - which has equipped him with the ability to show empathy with the daily struggles of voters. He has decent people skills, he is unfactional and he gets on with most colleagues. He has shown a capacity in the past to do tough things, such as selling student tuition fees to Labour MPs. He has also shown an ability to take the heat out of controversy when that is demanded. Since he took over as Health Secretary the NHS has become a much less toxic issue for the government. The large doubt about Alan Johnson is whether his mind is strategic enough and his temperament is bold enough to rescue Labour from its plight. That's compounded because he has expressed doubt about himself, suggesting rather too frequently that he doesn't think he is up to being Prime Minister. Self-deprecation can be an attractive quality in a politician, but it rarely gets someone to the very top. The highest hurdle he needs to overcome is his own sense of inferiority.</p> <p>That is not a problem for David Miliband. Never can it be said that the Foreign Secretary lacks intellectual self-assurance. Every time he has moved cabinet post he has fashioned a fresh theoretical construct for his new department within weeks of arriving there. At intellectualising about how Labour can renew itself, he has easily been the most impressive member of the cabinet.</p> <p>There's been much less from him, or any of Mr Brown's other internal critics, in terms of an alternative programme. That's partly because collective responsibility makes it impossible for a minister to directly quarrel with government policy without leaving the cabinet. It is also because those who have given up on the Prime Minister don't think that the fundamental problem is the policies. What they think, but can't say so out loud, is that the fundamental problem is Mr Brown.</p> <p>David Miliband lacks a broad power base in the party. That showed at the end of July when he effectively issued a call to arms. The Foreign Secretary was deflated and wounded that there was no rush, even among the many who agree with him, to muster around the standard he unfurled.</p> <p>The trades unions are very distrustful of him. This might not be true of all the rank and file, but it is certainly the case at the top. A former cabinet minister who is very pro-Miliband acknowledges that: 'The union bosses hate David.'</p> <p>To become leader, he has to be terribly careful that he is not painted as the candidate of an ultra-Blairite restoration. As I've argued before, he is much more of a social democrat than his old boss ever was. Tony Blair terminated his career as Head of the Policy Unit at Number 10 at the end of the first term because the then Prime Minister did not think David Miliband was Blairite enough. He has the potential to be more radical - on the environment or in regulating the excesses of finance capitalism - than either the current Prime Minister or his predecessor. First David Miliband has to prove to his party that he would be a superior replacement for Brown, not an inferior retread of Blair.</p> <p>Thousands of eyes will be on the Foreign Secretary and the Health Secretary, examining them to see whether either or both could offer salvation. That means the two men will have to teeter along a tightrope. Be too naked about advertising their leadership potential and they will be exposed to charges of disloyalty and vicious briefing by Mr Brown's acolytes. But the opposite risk is even greater. Be too nervous about suggesting that there is an alternative to sleepwalking into oblivion and they will crush hope. That is why I say there are three speeches that matter this week.</p> <p>Both Alan Johnson and David Miliband faced a not dissimilar moment when the Labour party last met for a conference in Manchester. That was two years ago, just after Tony Blair made his announcement that it would be his farewell conference as leader. Though Gordon Brown was easily the favourite to take over, there was plenty of appetite at that conference to find a credible alternative to him, a yearning especially strong among those who already had their anxieties about whether he could be a successful Prime Minister. Many arrived at that conference interested to see whether someone else was on offer.</p> <p>They came away disappointed. David Miliband's speech was not one of his best. Alan Johnson's performance was worse. Neither man seized the moment. Even those opposed to Mr Brown's succession went away from that conference resigned to the idea that he was inevitable.</p> <p>I'm still not sure what's the best explanation for their failure to rise to the occasion. Did they deliberately flop because they lacked the confidence and the support to rival Mr Brown? Perhaps. Or maybe they didn't have it then because they never will have it.</p> <p>Two years on, many more eyes will be on the Foreign Secretary and the Health Secretary to see if either of them has what it takes to rescue Labour.</p> <p>Gordon Brown says this is not a moment for 'faint hearts'. No, indeed it is not. Destiny can call more than once. This week in Manchester it again taps the shoulders of Alan Johnson and David Miliband. We will see whether they are now ready and able to respond to the call.</p>",
  "<p>The moment when I really saw the point of pizza - you could call it my pizza awakening - occurred last summer at a restaurant in Florence. From the look of it, you wouldn't think that Il Pizzaiolo was anything special. Customers sit at wooden benches amid scruffy decor and choose from handwritten menus. Only the queues outside betray the fact that this is no ordinary pizzeria. The pizzas are made in the traditional Neapolitan style, which means that there are strict rules governing the ingredients used, the type of oven in which the pizza is cooked, even the way the dough is handled. It was only when I tucked into my pizza that night that I began to understand the difference these things make.</p> <p>The first thing that struck me about my pizza wasn't its topping - mozzarella, tomato and salami - but its base. I'd always assumed that the best pizzas have super-thin crusts, but this one was surprisingly thick, especially round the edge, where the heat of the oven had caused it to flare up in angry blisters. Although the dough was crisp on the outside, inside it was soft and chewy, almost like Indian nan bread. I was more aware than usual, eating this pizza, that what I was consuming was essentially a piece of bread. Rather than being a vehicle for the topping, the base seemed like the pizza's true focus.</p> <p>But the topping wasn't irrelevant. My dinner companion, who'd been to Il Pizzaiolo before, advised me to pay the \u20ac2 supplement that entitles you to have mozzarella di bufala (otherwise you get the cow's-milk variety). The cheese billowed out luxuriantly across the surface of the crust, mingling with the tomato (which was sparingly applied) and the salami. The elements of the topping - acidity (tomatoes), richness (cheese) and saltiness (salami) - seemed perfectly balanced. And its gooey, almost liquid texture was offset by the chewiness of the bread. </p> <p>My visit to Il Pizzaiolo got me thinking about pizzas. Despite being one of the most popular foods on the planet, they are curiously hard to define. Hawaiians put pineapple on pizza; the Japanese go in for potatoes and mayonnaise. Even margherita - the simplest and oldest pizza - differs considerably depending on where you find it: a $1.49 slice from a deep-pan pizza-to-go counter in Chicago is a very different proposition to a wood-fired number from Naples. Even within Italy, pizzas vary considerably in dimension and composition. Roman ones are larger and thinner than Neapolitan ones; in Florence there is a tradition (thankfully not observed at Il Pizzaiolo) of using frankfurter as a topping. </p> <p>Another thought struck me about pizzas that night: that they tell us something about what constitutes good cooking. Pizzas vary greatly in quality; you can get ones that are virtually inedible and ones that are so delicious you never want to stop eating them. It is easy to spot the difference between the two; but what isn't so easy is pinpointing exactly what causes the difference. Both good and bad pizzas deploy the same building blocks - bread, tomato and cheese - and are made following the same basic steps (make the dough, let it rise, flatten it, add topping, bake in oven). It is the little things that determine whether this process succeeds or fails: the care with which the dough is made, the thought that goes into the topping. Pizzas are different from foods like pasta or toast, which can be transformed by the addition of, say, truffle or foie gras. To try to turn pizza into something luxurious is to overlook its true, humble nature.</p> <p>After my revelatory evening at Il Pizzaiolo, it was sobering to return to Britain. Although pizzas in this country have improved in recent decades, they still aren't a patch on what Italy has to offer. Upmarket chains like Pizza Express, Strada and Basilica make decent pizzas - they are certainly a big improvement on Pizza Hut and Pizzaland. But none of them are truly authentic. The real deal, as served at Il Pizzaiolo, is altogether different. </p> <p>I was therefore intrigued when a friend told me about a new pizza place in south London, dedicated to making Neapolitan pizzas. Franco Manca is housed in the covered section of Brixton Market, squeezed between a fishmonger and a mobile-phone shop. It is not the first pizzeria to occupy the site: until recently there was a branch of Eco there, and before that a restaurant called Franco's. (Franco Manca, which means 'Frank's Missing' in Italian, is named in homage to the original owner.) </p> <p>The place is owned by a couple called Giuseppe Mascoli and Bridget Hugo. He is in his early fifties, and is originally from the southern Italian town of Positano. She is in her mid-thirties, and South African. Aside from the fact that he is Italian, they are an unlikely pair of pizza pioneers. Mascoli moved to London in the late Eighties to take up a research post at the London School of Economics, and has subsequently carved out a niche for himself as a kind of cultural impresario. He owns Black's, a private members' club in Soho popular with journalists and artists, and is also the proprietor of The Drawbridge, a low-circulation periodical whose contributors include John Berger and Roger Scruton. Hugo is a somewhat prickly conceptual artist who, when she's not hanging out at Mascoli's house, lives in a studio under a railway arch.</p> <p>I visited Franco Manca on a recent weekday lunchtime, and spent a few hours chatting to Mascoli and observing how the pizzas are made (Hugo was on holiday). Mascoli is a disconcerting combination of playboy and intellectual. He speaks with a thick accent, and his conversation darts off uncontrollably in all directions, taking in politics, philosophy, the art world and - frequently - sex. Within minutes of our meeting, he is extolling the virtues of having sex in front of a mirror, and even comes up with a culinary analogy to illustrate its benefits: 'Sex without mirrors is like having a spaghetti carbonara without parmesan.' </p> <p>Behind the bluster, however, it's clear that Mascoli takes pizzas very seriously. He is particularly obsessed with dough, and is a mine of information regarding gluten, proofing temperatures and rising times. Before he and Hugo opened Franco Manca, they turned his kitchen into a dough laboratory; it took them months to perfect the recipe. Franco Manca's pizzas have a sourdough crust, which means that the dough is made using a starter culture, not yeast. The starter Mascoli and Hugo use was stolen by a friend from a bakery on Ischia (a small island off the coast of Naples) and, he says, dates from at least the 1730s. 'If it's that old, it's likely to be good.' </p> <p>The pizza-making routine that Mascoli and Hugo have established runs with military precision. Each afternoon at three o'clock the head pizza chef - or pizzaiolo - makes the batch of dough that will be used for tomorrow's pizzas (the restaurant is only open at lunchtime). A small amount of starter is mixed with large quantities of flour, water and salt, and the dough then spends an hour in an electric mixer (imported from Naples) before being left to rise in a special proofing cabinet until the following morning. By this point it is incredibly elastic - Mascoli shows me some, stretching it across the span of his arms. The dough is then shaped into individual balls, which, after an hour's further proofing, are ready to be made into pizzas. </p> <p>Once the day's service begins, I spend an hour or so watching the pizzaiolo - Salvo D'Angela - at work. D'Angela's hands move astonishingly fast at he puts each ball of dough on a floured surface, goes over it a few times with a tiny rolling pin, then flattens it further by hand. Using a ladle, he spreads a small amount of tomato on to each disk of dough, then adds the other topping ingredients. Next he transfers the pizza from the work surface to the oven using a long wooden paddle, or peel. This step, Mascoli explains, is crucial. The pizza has to be manoeuvred onto the peel in a particular way, so that it receives a final stretching, and it is then deposited into the oven with a sort of circular flick. It takes six months, Mascoli says, to learn how to execute these moves; watching D'Angela, I can believe it. </p> <p>A wood-fired oven is vital for an authentic pizza; Mascoli's was made for him by an artisan in Naples. 'It has to be between 90 and 130cm wide and no more than 35cm high on the inside,' he explains. These dimensions matter, because they determine the oven's heat and humidity. Franco Manca's pizzas are cooked at more than 500 \u00b0C - twice as hot as the hottest setting on a domestic oven. 'If you could get an ordinary gas oven to that temperature, the pizza would turn to charcoal. But because the pizza oven is so low, it's very humid - which means the pizza cooks without burning.' The pizzas stay in the oven for exactly 40 seconds; only this short cooking time, Mascoli says, guarantees a crust with the right combination of crispness and chewiness.</p> <p>Franco Manca's pizzas - there are just six of them - are priced between \u00a33.90 and \u00a35.60. There's a margherita (for \u00a34.60), one with mushrooms, one with capers, olives and artichokes, and one simply topped with tomato, garlic and oregano (for \u00a33.90). On the day I visit there's a special made with fresh girolle mushrooms and mozzarella - and Mascoli and I sit down to one of these after my tutorial is over. Before we start eating, Mascoli lifts up a section of the pizza and shows me the underside. The crust is covered in small black charcoal marks - 'like a leopard's skin', he says. 'This means the pizza is cooked just right.' </p> <p>It is indeed extraordinarily good. The crust has a distinctly sour taste, but this isn't overwhelming. The mozzarella, which is made specially for Franco Manca at an organic farm in Somerset, is wonderfully buttery, its richness the perfect foil for the mushrooms. This particular pizza doesn't have tomato - Mascoli points out that it would overwhelm the flavour of the girolles. Within minutes our plate is empty. Mascoli summons the waitress and places a new order - this time for a chorizo and mozzarella pizza (the most expensive, at \u00a35.60). I find it oddly comforting that it will take only 40 seconds to cook. </p> <p>As we lay siege to our second pizza - which is even richer than the first - Mascoli's conversation takes a philosophical turn. He tells me how he and Hugo have sourced every one of their topping ingredients with the utmost care. The olives and olive oil come from a particular producer in Spain ('Spanish olives are better than Italian ones'); the tomatoes are procured from a cannery situated in the mountains next to Naples; the chorizo is from the Spanish delicatessen Brindisa. All these things are vital for culinary reasons - but, he adds with a twinkle in his eye, they serve a secondary purpose. 'The topping is important for sending out a message. It ensures that only some kinds of people come here. You see, for me cooking is not only about including but also about excluding; Nietzsche said the same thing of writing. The topping is a kind of drawbridge - it keeps the right people out.'</p> <p>I am a bit taken aback by this, and suggest to Mascoli that his attitude is unpalatably elitist. He is unfazed. 'It's impossible to be elitist and make pizza,' he replies, then pauses for a while before continuing. 'I don't think I'm an elitist. I'm a pizza fascist.' Warming to his theme, Mascoli embarks on a wide-ranging monologue whose animating principle, as far as I can tell, is that too much liberalisation is a bad idea, since it pollutes the social sphere and leaves people to drag themselves down in a kind of orgy of junk food and television. The answer is an authoritarian state funded by taxing the well-off ('I'm a Tory socialist like Eric Hobsbawm'). Mascoli says all this with an impish smile, and it is hard to know how serious he is being. After another pause, he rounds things off with a characteristically well-turned epigram: 'The only people who love freedom are those who haven't been handcuffed by the right person.' I dutifully jot his words down in my notebook, feeling a bit like Genghis Khan's amanuensis.</p> <p>Leaving Mascoli to his thoughts, I head out to see what his customers think of his pizzas. The first couple I speak to are from Essex, and have made a special trip to the restaurant having read about it in a newspaper review. 'The pizzas are really good for the price,' the woman says. 'But they are very Italian and English people aren't used to this. Personally I'd like to see a bit more mozzarella.' The man also thinks they are a challenge for British palates, but agrees that they are a bargain. 'They're cheaper than the pizzas in Essex, which is ironic.' Though this is hardly a ringing endorsement, the next couple I speak to are ecstatic. 'We've been coming to this place for years, even back when it was Franco's,' the woman says. 'But this place is in a different league. It's definitely the best pizza we've had in Britain.' </p> <p>Not long after this, I say goodbye to Mascoli. Over the next few days, the memory of the mushroom pizza we shared keeps popping into my head - along with his comments about drawbridges and taxation. Whatever one thinks of his political views, he is undeniably someone who knows how to make a good pizza. The second couple I spoke to were right: Franco Manca's pizzas are the best in Britain (although I'm still not sure they are quite as good as the ones at Il Pizzaiolo). If pizza fascism is the price to be paid for such quality, then I guess I can live with that. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Franco Manca, 4 Market Row, Electric Lane, London SW9, 020 7738 3021</p>",
  "<p>An early invention by Albert Einstein has been rebuilt by scientists at Oxford University who are trying to develop an environmentally friendly refrigerator that runs without electricity.</p> <p>Modern fridges are notoriously damaging to the environment. They work by compressing and expanding man-made greenhouse gases called freons - far more damaging that carbon dioxide - and are being manufactured in increasing numbers. Sales of fridges around the world are rising as demand increases in developing countries. </p> <p>Now Malcolm McCulloch, an electrical engineer at Oxford who works on green technologies, is leading a three-year project to develop more robust appliances that can be used in places without electricity. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337828899\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/09/20/einstein-220x300.jpg\" alt=\"Einstein refrigerator\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Einstein refrigerator</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His team has completed a prototype of a type of fridge patented in 1930 by Einstein and his colleague, the Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard. It had no moving parts and used only pressurised gases to keep things cold. The design was partly used in the first domestic refrigerators, but the technology was abandoned when more efficient compressors became popular in the 1950s. That meant a switch to using freons.</p> <p>Einstein and Szilard's idea avoids the need for freons. It uses ammonia, butane and water and takes advantage of the fact that liquids boil at lower temperatures when the air pressure around them is lower. 'If you go to the top of Mount Everest, water boils at a much lower temperature than it does when you're at sea level and that's because the pressure is much lower up there,' said McCulloch.</p> <p>At one side is the evaporator, a flask that contains butane. 'If you introduce a new vapour above the butane, the liquid boiling temperature decreases and, as it boils off, it takes energy from the surroundings to do so,' says McCulloch. 'That's what makes it cold.'</p> <p>Pressurised gas fridges based around Einstein's design were replaced by freon-compressor fridges partly because Einstein and Szilard's design was not very efficient. But McCulloch thinks that by tweaking the design and replacing the types of gases used it will be possible to quadruple the efficiency. He also wants to take the idea further. The only energy input needed into the fridge is to heat a pump, and McCulloch has been working on powering this with solar energy.</p> <p>'No moving parts is a real benefit because it can carry on going without maintenance. This could have real applications in rural areas,' he said.</p> <p>McCulloch's is not the only technology to improve the environmental credentials of fridges. Engineers working at a Cambridge-based start-up company, Camfridge, are using magnetic fields to cool things. 'Our fridge works, from a conceptual point of view, in a similar way [to gas compressor fridges] but instead of using a gas we use a magnetic field and a special metal alloy,' said managing director Neil Wilson. </p> <p>'When the magnetic field is next to the alloy, it's like compressing the gas, and when the magnetic field leaves, it's like expanding the gas.' He added: 'This effect can be seen in rubber bands - when you stretch the band it gets hot, and when you let the band contract it gets cold.'</p> <p>Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said creating greener fridges was hugely important. 'If you look at developing countries, if they're aspiring to the lifestyles that we lead, they're going to require more cooling - whether that's air conditioning, food cooling or freezing. Putting in place the technologies that are both low greenhouse-gas refrigerants and low energy use is critical.'</p> <p>McCulloch's fridge is still in its early stages. 'It's very much a prototype; this is nowhere near commercialised,' he said. 'Give us another month and we'll have it working.'</p>",
  "<h2>Bad news for news</h2> <p>The mayhem in the financial markets is likely to hit Thomson Reuters hard. The fortunes of the global information group, formed by last year's \u00a37.9bn takeover of Reuters by Thomson, rest heavily on its markets division, which generates 40 per cent of profits. It provides financial news and data to investment banks and fund managers, which are already slashing costs. Chief executive Tom Glocer said last week there was a chance it could still increase profits next year, but added: 'If we're at the beginning of the Thirties, as some would say, it will be more serious.'

An investment of \u00a31,000 in gold at the turn of the decade would be worth well over \u00a33,000 now, and although that sort of return is all but impossible in the short term, gold may prove safer than shares and more lucrative than cash.</p> <h2>Problems at home</h2> <p>Anyone know how many newly built homes were sold in the UK last week?

While the firm, led by chief exec Peter Redfern, pictured, saw stock leap over 20 per cent on Friday, any thought of a real recovery in its bombed-out share price - some \u00a34bn of shareholder value has been wiped out - should be put on hold.

The country's 140 prisons include nine internationally recognised sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) as well as two European special areas for conservation and an internationally important wetland. </p> <p>Some of the important habitats are on land that is outside the prison walls, but in many cases threatened species such as barn owls, kingfishers, adders and slow-worms also reside at Her Majesty's pleasure within prison grounds.</p> <p>Dr Phil Thomas, sustainable development manager for the prisons estate, said the organisation is stepping up its work on biodiversity. 'It's really paying dividends, because many SSSIs on our estate are really in good condition,' he said. This is partly to meet the Prison Service's obligations under the 2006 Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act, which requires it to consider the impact of its operations on plant and animal life. But Thomas says the work also benefits the community and makes prisoners less likely to reoffend. </p> <p>The work, which involves inmates and conservation volunteers, ranges from building bird and bat boxes to surveying bird species from cell windows and constructing purpose-built habitats, such as ponds. The Prime Minister's country residence, Chequers, has also benefited. The estate recently erected a barn owl box made by inmates at Spring Hill prison near Bicester in Oxfordshire.</p> <p>The country's greenest prison is HMP North Sea Camp, thanks to the huge area of internationally important tidal wetland that surrounds it. The prison authorities manage this land to encourage migrating wading birds such as oystercatchers and curlews and it is recognised under the international Ramsar Convention on Wetlands as internationally important. The thousands of acres of salt marsh outside the prison walls also serve as a deterrent to any would-be escapees. 'It's a natural barrier. Where would you go?' said Thomas.</p> <p>The Observer was granted exclusive access to two prisons, Spring Hill and Bullingdon, both near Bicester, to see the greening programme in action. Bullingdon, which houses the full range of offenders from thieves to murderers, encourages prisoners to get involved in conservation. Last year inmates made more than 700 bird boxes from scrap wood for the prison grounds and sites managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. They are now working on an order for 250 more. 'It's amazing what you can do when you've got enough time,' said Richard, a sex offender who is serving a nine-year sentence. 'It's a lot better than doing nothing. We get a very minimal wage, but we are very self-motivated and enjoy what we do,' he added. 'It does pass the time a lot quicker if you are out here busy, rather than sitting brooding in your cell.' Prisoners are paid an average of \u00a39.60 a week.</p> <p>The thought of prisoners enjoying their work, however beneficial for the environment, runs counter to many people's views of what punishment should be, according to Lyn Costello of Mothers Against Murder and Aggression, a victim support group.</p> <p>'A lot of the families we deal with want to see them on bread and water and locked up 24 hours a day, but it's not going to work. We mustn't go too far over the line where we start making it a joy for people, but we do live in a supposedly civilised society and we have to think about rehabilitation,' she said. Prison authorities insist that the work helps inmates to recover a sense of self-worth and appreciate that there is a life beyond crime. 'At the end of the day, with everything we are doing in the conservation biodiversity world, if we get one that doesn't reoffend we've succeeded,' said Stuart Jenkins, head of facilities at HMP Bullingdon. </p> <p>Jenkins said the programme costs virtually nothing because the prisoners mostly use recycled materials. The prisoners and staff also contributed to the RSPB's Big Bird Watch, spotting 25 species inside and outside the walls.</p> <p>Outside Bullingdon's towering, 8m-high grey concrete walls there is an incongruous sight. The rows of lights trained on the outside of the wall are not mounted on barren land, but on a traditional English meadow that in the summer bristles with wildflowers - including endangered bee orchids. Beyond this is a strip of woodland dotted with tranquil glades that is home to nightingales and muntjac deer. </p> <p>Here Jenkins has found patches of eggs laid by brown hairstreak butterflies, a threatened species. This season he monitored their breeding success along with conservation volunteers from the Upper Thames Butterfly Group. Rather than numbering the hatchlings, he named them after prisons, such as Scrubs, Wandsworth and San Quentin, the infamous Californian jail.</p> <p>Although inmates cannot visit the prison's natural haven outside the wall, they do contribute to its upkeep. This year they constructed bee hives to provide pollinators for the wildflower meadow. Jenkins said the honey has proved a big hit with prison officers and visitors, who snap it up for \u00a32 a jar. 'We took 21lb off of one hive. It was gone within an hour,' he said.</p> <p>Spring Hill is an open prison where prisoners, most of whom are nearing the end of their sentences, have more freedom to move around the grounds. They have dug two ponds to encourage freshwater species such as kingfishers and newts, and they have a pair of barn owls breeding in a specially constructed box mounted on a disused fence post. The land around is managed to encourage barn owl prey, such as voles.</p> <h2>Prize-winning gardens</h2> <p>Leyhill Open Prison in Gloucestershire, situated between the Cotswolds and Vale of Berkeley, has extensive grounds. It has regularly won plaudits at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show, and, when winning gold for its 'Time, The Healer' garden, the prison made headlines and found itself the subject of the 2000 film Greenfingers, starring Clive Owen and Helen Mirren.</p> <p>Around 75 inmates work on its 55 hectares of farmland and gardens, which include extensive ornamental grounds. There is also a nationally important arboretum run with the Forestry Commission which is often open to the public. Horticulture is run on commercial lines, with salad and vegetables sent to supply other prisons.</p>",
  "<p>Government plans that would force tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plain, unbranded packets could be the most powerful tool yet unleashed in the war on smoking.</p> <p>The tobacco industry has admitted that the tactic, being pioneered in Britain but likely to be followed elsewhere, will slash profits and inflict enormous damage on cigarette manufacturers.</p> <p>Tobacco analysts have warned in a leading industry magazine that a ban on branding and logos on packets would lead smokers to abandon well-known brands such as Marlboro and Silk Cut, which cost up to \u00a36 a pack, and switch to cheaper options. Public health officials say it will strip cigarettes of their glamorous image and reduce the numbers of young people taking up the habit.</p> <p>The Department of Health is considering outlawing the use of logos, colours and graphics on packets and requiring them to be sold in plain packaging. The latest issue of Tobacco Journal International reports that 'according to analysts from Morgan Stanley, if generic packaging becomes a legal requirement in the UK, not only could it have a domino effect on other markets, but it could also have a materially adverse impact on cigarette brand equity [and] could result in considerably reduced profits'. David Adelman of Morgan Stanley said: 'If plain packaging were adopted in the UK, some other nations would most likely mandate [it] as well.'</p> <p>Adam Spielman, a tobacco analyst at Citigroup, told the publication: 'Plain packaging would level the playing field, making premium brands less attractive to smokers, and would lead to a rapid worsening of the downtrading [falling sales] trend which has been going on for years in the UK, far and away the most expensive country in Europe for smokers.' </p> <p>Tobacco companies fear that introducing the plain packaging would prompt many smokers to abandon the premium brands such as Marlboro and Benson and Hedges, and instead switch to much cheaper makes costing \u00a33.50 to \u00a34. </p> <p>As for the global tobacco industry, the seminal legislation could pose a real risk to profitability in the future, reports TJI. It points out that, as cigarette advertising is banned in the UK, packs have become more elaborate as they are the best way manufacturers can promote their brands and distinguish them from rival products. </p> <p>In an insight into the industry's finances, the journal says: 'While the cost of production is roughly the same for both and, according to analysts, the difference in quality is barely perceptible, the profit margin of premium brands is considerably higher than that of low-priced cigarettes.' </p> <p>The Health Department recently closed its consultation on a raft of measures to reduce the number of smokers even further, which has fallen to 22 per cent of the adult population. They include plain packaging, banning cigarettes from public displays in shops, outlawing packs of 10 and getting rid of vending machines. </p> <p>It received even more responses than the 55,000 it got before last year's public smoking ban. Most respondents supported the plans, including plain packaging. </p> <p>Deborah Arnott, director of health campaigning charity Ash, hailed plain packing as 'an idea whose time has come. The industry knows that plain packs spell the death knell to industry profitability,' she said. 'The industry cannot survive without recruiting replacements for the 100,000 UK citizens its products kill each year. Most of these new smokers are children and young people, who our research shows find plain packs much less attractive.' </p> <p>The tobacco industry argues that the moves will lead to a rise in cigarette smuggling, more counterfeiting of tobacco products and will threaten small retailers' livelihoods.</p>",
  "<p>Her books have shocked, titillated, appalled and delighted readers for more than a decade. She has been condemned as a self-obsessed, navel-gazing publicity hound, who represents all that has gone wrong with French fiction, and lionised as a courageous writer challenging social and creative taboos and suffering for her bravery. But never before has a work by Christine Angot, labelled the queen of 'auto-fiction', suffered the indignity of being judged boring.</p> <p>Angot's latest work - Le march\u00e9 des amants (The lover market) - recounts her recent relationship with a fading rapper, Bruno Beausire, more usually known by his lurid stage name, Doc Gyn\u00e9co. More than 300 pages long, liberally peppered with references to her lover's frustrated proclivity for sodomy, and featuring lengthy passages describing sex in a lift, discussions over whether or not to go for a coffee or who will call whom later, the book is the first of Angot's 14 works to be destroyed by the literary critics.</p> <p>'She has been lynched,' said Christophe Ono-dit-Biot, author and culture editor of Le Point magazine. 'It's very French. We build them up and then suddenly we decide to trample them into the dirt,' she explained.</p> <p>The attacks have undoubtedly been ferocious. Critic Christine Ferniot, writing in Lire magazine, described The Lover Market as 'dry, grey and boring... a B-series film with a Richard Clayderman soundtrack.' For J\u00e9rome Dupuis, in the weekly L'Express, the book was 'a long woolly text stuffed with inept conversations.'</p> <p>Though - or perhaps because - Doc Gyn\u00e9co controversially supported the right-wing President, Nicolas Sarkozy, in last year's election, the criticism has cut across political divides. An appalling review in the left-wing Le Nouvel Observateur was followed by worse in the influential intellectual Telerama listings magazine. Its critic described the book as a 'banal compilation of insignificant dialogues'.</p> <p>But for some observers the row is rooted more in the social tensions and prejudices of French society than in any literary flaws in Angot's latest work. The book's title is taken from one sentence - 'on the lover market, a black is worth less than a white'. Jean-Pierre Boul\u00e9, professor of contemporary French studies at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'The reaction has been so virulent because... what Angot, 49, is talking about is deeply shocking in the new conservative climate [in France].'</p> <p>Most of the polemics about the book have certainly focused on the relationship between Doc Gyn\u00e9co, who is from a poor suburban background, and the white middle-class writer. Some have even described it as a 'misalliance'.</p> <p>Her defenders point out that earlier books in which Angot described having sex respectively with her father, an elderly banker and figures from the cultural world have all been critically lauded.</p> <p>'It seems that this is one taboo that you can't transgress,' said Ono-dit-Biot. 'Doc Gyn\u00e9co himself is actually quite sympathetic, and though it might be a bit soppy the book is a rather nice love story. Angot's the girl from the good bourgeois family who ran off with the gardener. So she's been taken apart.'</p> <p>Angot refuses the title 'queen of auto-fiction', despite being described as such by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its official website. But some have seen her fall from grace as a sign that 'auto-fiction', a largely French literary genre that consists of using one's own slightly disguised experience as a basis for a narrative in which fact and fiction are mixed without clear distinction, has had its day.</p> <p>One of the major successes of this autumn has been a book advertised explicitly as 'not auto-fiction', in which a character condemns the genre as being defined as 'the more I speak, the more I am right ... I speak and it's called a book'.</p> <p>The best-selling author Michel Houellebecq, whose last book and the film based on it were both panned, is the latest proponent of the genre to fall foul of the critics. But Philippe Lan\u00e7on, literary critic of Lib\u00e9ration newspaper, pointed out that a lengthy new work by author Catherine Millet, whose account of her adulterous sex sessions with multiple anonymous partners became a global bestseller six years ago, has been well received. Millet's new book, Day of Suffering, recounts her own jealousy within her marriage, her masturbatory fantasies and sessions with her psychologists.</p> <p>'The problem with Angot's latest is what she says, not how she says it, Lan\u00e7on told The Observer. 'Millet's latest is very stylised, much more educated. The reader is among educated people and it's much less shocking,' he said.</p> <p>This year's autumnal crop of literary offerings includes 676 novels, of which 210 are foreign translations. Stars include David Lodge's Deaf Sentence and Ian McEwan's On Chesil Beach, which was third on the French bestseller list last week.</p> <p>'They are the kind of books that the French are no longer producing: well-written, humorous, satirical with bite in the one case; beautiful storytelling that perfectly conjures a historical moment in the other,' said Boul\u00e9. 'There is a longing for such works.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday September 28 2008</strong></p> <p>The article below was accompanied by the panel: 'Prawn cocktail: The chemicals used in one Vietnamese prawn pond'. The substances listed were from research into chemical traces found in prawns around the world, not just in Vietnam. Two of those listed, chloramphenicol and nitrofurans, are banned in Vietnam.</p> <p> </p> <p>There's no lack of building materials around the prawn ponds of the Mekong Delta. Walls are constructed of the empty plastic sacks of pesticides and prawn feed. It's cheap, but sweaty. Southern Vietnam is hot and sticky at any time and the humid air inside the Huong family's one-room hut, perched on a prawn-pond dyke, is rank with chemicals: we cough and sneeze when we enter. There's an acrid dust all over the mud floor, which makes you worry for little Huong Thi Mai, who is seven, a patient little girl sitting on the low bed near the door watching her parents work. I glance at her bare shins for signs of the skin infections that are common among prawn-farm workers, but she looks OK. </p> <p>Mr Huong is proud: 'This is a very modern prawn-farming business,' he says. And, with luck and four months' hard labour, it is going to make him and his family quite rich. After they've paid their debts, the Huongs hope to buy a moped and their first fridge. Thi Mai might go to a new school. 'We can have a better life,' says Mrs Huong. But until the tiger prawns are ready for harvest, and shipped off to Europe or America, the family must live here, keeping a 24-hour watch beside the sour-smelling pond. They've borrowed \u00a34,000, a huge sum, to invest in prawn larvae, feed and medicines - and they need to keep alert in case anyone steals the growing crustaceans.</p> <p>Modernity, for Mr Huong, appears to be chiefly measured in chemicals. I count 13 different pots, jars and sacks of these in the hut, and he eagerly talks me through them. He's particularly keen on a compound called 'Super Star' - the Vietnamese print on the label says it 'intensifies the metabolism to help prawns grow fat'. He learnt about this additive on a government-run course at the local fishery training centre. 'We're not allowed to use much - only 10 bottles per crop,' he says.</p> <p>There are other glossy labels - most of them for products made in Thailand, the centre of the world's prawn farming industry. Mr Huong mixes up a feed in a big white basin while we talk. The basic feed, he says, is soya, broken rice and fish and prawn parts. But in it goes a large dose of 'Amino-Pro'. 'It will help the shrimp taste better,' he says. The label has familiar words from stock- cube packets: aspartic acid, glutamic acid and taurine, which is the key element of the energy drink Red Bull. Then there is Vitamix, 'to make prawns grow faster', Calphorax 'to help the shell thicken and give better colour' and Vin Superclear 'to kill pest, virus and smell'. And on top is a seasoning of antibiotic.</p> <p>Prawn farming is an ancient activity in tropical countries. Coastal peoples in Indonesia and Vietnam have trapped young marine prawns in brackish ponds for at least 500 years, feeding them up with fish scraps and household waste to eat or sell. The prawns, properly farmed, are sweet and juicy: it's a lucrative business. The larvae can reach marketable size, as long as your hand, in as little as four months. But the trade has changed utterly since black tiger prawns (known as 'shrimp' in most countries) and bamboo prawns became a routine luxury in the rich world in the 1990s. The ancient cottage industry was swiftly industrialised. Around the tropical belt, from Ecuador to Indonesia, coastal farmers punched holes in the sea defences and let salt water into their paddy fields for the gold rush.</p> <p>As with salmon, coffee and a host of other once rare and expensive foods, the demand from rich countries brought more and more producers into the market. Fifty tropical countries are now exporting large farmed prawn. Tiger or 'king' prawns and their siblings have become a staple of supermarket fish counters. The result - it's so familiar, it is almost a law of economics - has been ever-falling prices, increasing use of chemicals, dropping quality. And, of course, scares. Shipments of prawn from the tropics are regularly refused by governmental testers in Europe and America. The chemicals used in a production system that packs 20 of these wild animals into one square metre of foul, endlessly recycled water have been shown again and again to harm the workers, the environment and possibly the consumers. What's surprising, perhaps, is that we are still in love with them. </p> <p>And we do eat a lot of them. 'King prawns to overtake burgers as barbecue food,' ran a news story last month. Tropical farmed prawns are now Britain's fifth most popular fish. Sales were up 14 per cent last year - and we now spend \u00a3169 million a year on them, four times as much as we spend on frozen burgers. At one supermarket which has seen a 20 per cent increase in sales, a spokesperson told me that tropical prawns are 'so fashionable' because they are 'a light and healthy option'. Enthusiastic endorsement from celebrity chefs has boosted the boom - recently Gordon Ramsay has salivated over king prawn and wonton soup on The F Word and Jamie Oliver told viewers to skewer them with bay leaves and lemon slices for the barbecue. Barbecued prawns with a saffron aioli appeared in The Observer's barbecue guide last month.</p> <p>Light and healthy? I think about this as we follow Mr Huong through a litter of silicate sacks and empty prawn-feed bags to the pond. It measures 400 square metres, about two tennis courts. It was once the family's ancestral rice paddy, and at this time of year the growing seedlings should be turning the landscape a brilliant yellow-green. But the pond, and all the others nearby, is now a viscous grey, like old washing-up water.</p> <p>Mr Huong paddles off in a little flat boat, scattering the feed we saw him mix up earlier. A system of paddle wheels, driven by a diesel engine, lies ready to stir up the water and bring oxygen to the shellfish packed beneath. There are 80,000 of them below the surface. Back on the dyke, he dips a flat net into the opaque water, and pulls up a few of the animals to weigh them and inspect them for deformities. They are two months old, about the size of my index finger. The translucent beige creatures wriggle and jump like busy grasshoppers. </p> <p>The Huongs, like all their neighbours, opened the dykes and turned to prawn farming because of the fantastic profits available. A field that would have once provided enough rice for the family to eat, and a little extra to sell for essentials, has suddenly become an asset with the potential to change their lives. If this crop is successful the Huongs will sell the grown prawns for \u00a38,000 - if prices hold up - after only four months.</p> <p>This is an enormous amount in a country where many rural people still survive on less than \u00a31 a day. As a result, many of the rice farmers of Tra Vinh have now become chemists, experts in the complex biology of intensively farmed crustaceans. Across the dykes we see men and women in their conical hats dipping test tubes in the water, testing acidity levels, examining prawns in the test nets for the dreaded signals of disease: reddening shells, misshapen bodies, white spots on their legs. They are trained and encouraged by the Vietnamese government, which, through promoting cash crops like this one, has been uniquely successful in Asia at increasing Vietnam's exports and reducing poverty in the country. </p> <p>But there are calamities that can't be sorted out with science. If anything goes wrong the family will lose all their investment, and they won't have any rice to eat either. If they borrowed the money for the prawn larvae, they'll lose their land, too. Things happen here. This coastline along the South China Sea is prone to typhoons, which will destroy all the farmers' work in a night. The coastal mangrove forests, which once offered some protection to the people of these marginal lands, have been uprooted in many prawn farming areas across the tropics - the bandwagon of the shellfish gold rush has destroyed even these crucial natural barricades to the ocean.</p> <p>The prawns, packed in the ponds, are terribly prone to illness. The last batch of prawn larvae all died after one month - the Huongs don't know why. White-spot virus almost killed off the industry in Vietnam two years ago. And, having gambled everything on prawns, people will of course do anything to protect their investment. That includes using any chemicals that may seem to help. 'Often we get consignments of antibiotics for human use, which are past the date they can be used by,' a village headman told me. It is well known that use of antibiotics can stimulate growth.</p> <p>This is a temporary land, on loan from the ocean. It's tidy, almost Dutch, with its network of carefully constructed dykes and endless bridges, the South China Sea a pressing presence behind a row of raggedy firs. The mangrove forests have been replanted, after education work with the local communities, by Oxfam and the Vietnamese authorities. On the main road there's a sign, as big as an advertising billboard. Under a vivid picture of jars and bottles and dead prawns it lists all the chemicals that prawn farmers must not use: 51 of them. They include many human antibiotics, penicillins, and some names I recognise from the bad days of the European fish-farming industry - nitrofuran, chloramphenicol and organophosphate pesticides.</p> <p>It's impressive and it shows the real efforts the Vietnamese government has been taking to educate farmers, reduce use of dangerous chemicals and improve quality. After all, export of farmed fish is worth $3.6 billion annually to the country. One government official said to me: 'We know Western people are suspicious of our seafood. There were scandals in 2002 that nearly destroyed our markets. So it is in our interest to keep quality high and reduce the use of chemicals.' And prawn farming has changed the face of Tra Vinh province. So much richer has the boom made this isolated corner of the Mekong's great delta that Oxfam will shortly end its long-standing poverty-reduction programmes.</p> <p>'Shrimp has made this province rich,' the official said. And you can see it. Houses have televisions and mopeds outside them. School enrolment rates have soared. Five years after the scandals that nearly turned Europe off warm-water prawn, Vietnam's exports of the shellfish increased by 32 per cent last year. In Britain we're eating three times as many tropical prawns as we were five years ago - and the price of them has halved. </p> <p>I ran the long list of chemicals we found past Peter Bridson, who is in charge of aquaculture at the Soil Association. He oversees the policing of the salmon farms in Scotland which, controversially, the Soil Association decided three years ago to certify as organic. Nothing we had found in Vietnam surprised him. 'This is what you see again and again in industrial aquaculture. There's a get- rich-quick attitude, everyone follows the boom. But then, one false step, and it crashes. And disease is usually the problem.'</p> <p>Most of the chemicals we photographed in Mr Huong's shed are pesticides, feed enhancers and growth stimulants. 'These types of products are commonly used in Asian hatcheries,' says Bridson, who has worked in tropical fish farming. 'The farmers experiment. Someone chucks something in his tanks and gets good results. He tells his mates and the use of this product becomes mainstream in the area - whether it actually does anything or not.'</p> <p>Mr Huong's Super Star contains a chemical commonly used as a 'nutritional enhancer'. It is marketed by the company Bayer in Europe as 'Butaphosphan'. On Bayer's website all I can find is a recommendation that it be used for injecting into sheep, dogs and cats suffering from 'stress, overexertion or exhaustion' and as a tonic in cases of weakness or anaemia in animals. (Bayer does not supply the chemical in Vietnam nor market it as a 'nutritional enhancer'.) </p> <p>The problem is that some chemicals may do more harm than good - and not just to the image of the tropical prawn. Super Star also contains methyl hydroxybenzoate, an anti-fungal preservative that is banned in France and Australia and has been linked to cancer in some beauty treatments. The most dubious thing we found in the Huong's arsenal of chemicals was in a pot named 'N300'. It is a 'medicine for digestion and liver function', made by a Vietnamese company called Cong Ty TNHH. It had beta glucan, a harmless component of many human nutrition supplements, but also norfloxacin, an antibiotic usually used to treat gonorrhea and urinary-tract infections in humans. It is currently 'under watch' by the US Federal Drug Administration because of increased reports of nasty side effects, including damage to tendons. </p> <p>Norfloxacin and its siblings, the fluoroquinolones, are banned for use in animals for human consumption in the States, and subject to EU controls in imports. Misuse of the fluoroquinolones is increasingly blamed for the rise in resistance to anti-bacterial medicines, and five floxacins are listed on the poster of banned chemicals we saw at the entrance to the village. Since 2005 Vietnam's fishery ministry has banned the use of fluoroquinolones in fish destined for the North American market, but not, apparently, for European countries. From the pile of empty N300 jars we saw, there is a lot of fluoroquinolone going into the feed for Mr Huong's prawns.</p> <p>Numerous surveys have been done on the effects of the antibiotics that are used in prawn farming across the world (31 different ones were identified in Vietnam in a 2006 study, among a total 155 different drugs). They conclude that, although the antibiotics may rise to detectable levels in the bodies of the prawn, the most likely damage is being done to the environment in which they're farmed. It's Thi Mai who may have problems when doctors try to treat her for skin complaints, diarrhoea, respiratory problems and other bacterial infections, including malaria, which is common in this swampy landscape. They may find that she is resistant to the antibiotics. Scientists have speculated that some unusual outbreaks of salmonella poisoning in Europe and the States may have been started by antibiotic-resistant salmonella in farmed fish from Asia.</p> <p>And the leakage of antibiotics and pesticides into the delicate ecosystem in the coastal shallows of the shrimp-farming countries will have effects that no one yet fully understands. Peter Bridson worries that the chemicals will intensify, because the water system is closed, with water being reused from one farm to another, and for human consumption. David Moriarty, a scientist at the University of Queensland who has studied the wide-scale use of norfloxacin and other anti-bacterials in aquaculture wrote nine years ago of disturbing effects in prawn farms in the Philippines: 'Many of the pathogens appear to have mutated to more virulent forms than were present a decade ago ... I feel that the incidence of disease has been exacerbated by the actions of the [prawn] farmers.' Moriarty now works promoting probiotics to tropical prawn farmers, as an alternative to lacing the waters with chemicals. </p> <p>The Soil Association, meanwhile, which is currently processing applications to be certified organic from several tropical prawn farms, has decided not to allow any use of antibiotics in prawn-growing farms that want to carry its label. The Vietnamese, meanwhile, are working hard to police the use of antibiotics and other chemicals better. VASEP, the prawn exporters' and producers' organisation, points out that 25 new licences were granted to Vietnamese processors by the EU in January 2008, an endorsement of the fisheries ministry's 'urgent efforts' to improve sanitary and safety standards in the prawn industry. </p> <p>So is that it for tiger prawn kebabs? How worried should we prawn lovers be? Well, norfloxacin is used by countless other farmers in Asia, but it is not illegal in most of those countries (though I could not find it on Vietnam's lengthy list of approved chemicals). There are increasing environmental fears about its overuse, and worries over the effect on human health of all the quinolones. But unless you have a serious king-prawn habit, you are unlikely to ingest anything like a human dose of norfloxacin. </p> <p>Food &amp; Water Watch, an American NGO that has studied prawn farming for 10 years, states in its latest report: 'The negative effects of eating industrially produced shrimp may include neurological damage from ingesting chemicals such as endosulfans, an allergic response to penicillin residues or infection by an antibiotic-resistant pathogen such as E coli.' That is a judicious 'may': a rational person in this age of food scares would have to conclude you're unlikely to suffer more ill effects from eating farmed prawns than from any other industrially produced food animal. But I wouldn't eat them every day. </p> <p>It is certain, however, that banned or controlled chemicals are coming into the country with farmed prawns, despite the promises of governments and the retailers. Last year the EU rejected shipments of farmed prawn from six major exporters in India because they contained chloramphenicol and nitrofurans - two once-common antibiotics, one now known to cause leukaemia, the other a carcinogen. </p> <p>The EU claims that this shows its regulations work, but the fact remains that the EU is thought to test only around one per cent of such shipments. America imports $3.9 billion worth of farmed prawn (or shrimp, as its known there) a year, yet tests hardly more of the shipments than does the EU. All the same, it rejected 2,817 shipments of seafood in 2005, most of them farmed 'shrimp'. And in Louisiana, a shrimp-producing region which conducts its own tests on imports, chloramphenicol was found in nine per cent of all foreign shrimp shipments in 2007. </p> <p>I'm grateful to Taras Grescoe for that last piece of information. His fascinating new book, Bottomfeeder, describes the mad and scary practices of the fishing industry in nauseating detail. Grescoe says he thinks farmed prawn is the most disgusting of all the industrial farmed products - worse than salmon, worse than battery chicken. And he won't eat them.</p> <p>It's not just the chemicals that turned him off. The land grab for prawn farms that has destroyed the mangrove forest has harmed wild animals and humans too. Seventy per cent of Ecuador's mangrove has gone. Rights to land are well-established in Vietnam, for women and men, but in other tropical countries there are disturbing reports of abuse of coastal peoples by big business cashing in on the boom. Food &amp; Water Watch has visited one district of Andhra Pradesh in India where 2,000 families have become 'shrimp refugees', displaced by big corporations who wanted their land for prawn farms.</p> <p>Unlike Grescoe, though, I'm not going to stop eating the prawns. That's too easy. Going on farmed-prawn strike won't hurt the villains in this story. They are, as in any tale of shipping the foods of the poor world to the rich in bulk, the big corporations, the processors and the retailers. They would survive a collapse of the industry - the people who won't are the poor coastal fishermen of Vietnam and 50 other countries, for whom prawn farming is proving a way out of poverty. These people have risked much to satisfy our demand for exotic seafood - there's no way back when you flood your family's rice paddy with seawater for tiger prawns. The salt from the water will make it impossible to grow rice again for years. </p> <p>There are other ways to help them. Oxfam, which has been working in Tra Vinh for 10 years, is helping some of the farmers set up co-operatives and loan schemes to make traditional fishing and farming more lucrative: we visited villages where the whole community has become partners in a cockle-fishing enterprise. Its sustainable, it creates jobs and it's doing well.</p> <p>But to make a difference across the tropics, we customers must demand better prawns, raised organically and in a way that's good for them and the people who farm them. We have to be prepared to pay more for them. On my desk I have a 212g box from my local supermarket of uncooked peeled king prawns from Vietnam, which I found on sale at a two-for-\u00a35 deal. That means the 60 or so prawns cost me about 12p each - after shelling, freezing, packing and shipping. That is just two pence more than Mr Huong hoped to sell his prawns for. It's not enough. The price is the same for trawled wild prawns from the North Atlantic.</p> <p>Bad prawn farming is caused by the same things as bad chicken farming - the relentless downward pressure on prices forced on producers by supermarkets. So, there's a good reason to buy organic. And a good reason too, to ask your supermarket to ensure that more of the money you are spending on a tiger prawn goes back to Mr Huong and his colleagues. Pay him a bit better, and he could farm a bit better. It's that simple.</p> <h2>Prawn cocktail: the chemicals used in one Vietnamese prawn pond</h2> <p>Butaphosphan is a veterinary medicine to treat metabolic and developmental disorders.</p> <p>Methyl Hydroxybenzoate is an anti-fungal agent, also known as methylparaben.

  "<p>When Henry 'Hank the Hammer' Paulson accepted the job of US Treasury Secretary at the tail end of the flagging Bush administration, his biggest worry was that he would not be able to make a difference. Many of his contemporaries agreed. With just two years to make his mark and waning Republican support in Congress, not much was expected of Paulson. How wrong they were.</p> <p>In the past week, Paulson, a former Goldman Sachs banker, has intervened in the market in an attempt to thwart certain global financial Armageddon more times than any of his predecessors in American history. Some of the measures he has taken go even further than the policies drawn up in the aftermath of the 1929 Wall Street Crash and the ensuing Great Depression. And there will surely be more intervention and more reform before this crisis is over.</p> <p>But while he has boldly stepped in to save some - Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG - he has let others feel the pain. Just ask Lehman Brothers' 26,000 employees how they feel about Paulson's methods and you won't hear many kind words.</p> <p>He likes to define his approach as flexible, but some call it unpredictable. However it is cast, this case-by-case approach and rejection of dogma in favour of action is the hallmark of Paulson's tenure at the Treasury so far.</p> <p>In August 2006, just before Paulson was appointed to his current position, he showed his true colours with a four-point economic plan. President Bush and the far right of the Republican Party were stunned as the uber-capitalist they had handpicked from Wall Street seemed to be a bit of a lefty.</p> <p>First he outlined a renewed energy policy to stop global warming. Indeed, Paulson was the only member of President Bush's cabinet who dared acknowledge that human actions contribute to global warming and that America should take swift action to address it.</p> <p>Then he prescribed new policy to fix global trade and investment policy. In a series of recommendations that had Republicans fuming, he vowed to reform social security and health care for the poor and to address the growing income gap between rich and poor.</p> <p>To talk of an income gap when all others in the administration were still slapping themselves on the back for maintaining economic growth at all costs was utter heresy in the Bush camp.</p> <p>But Hank the Hammer was not used to softening his views for anyone, and besides, he barely had two years of a lame-duck administration left so he was hardly likely to be able to achieve his lofty manifesto. </p> <p>Of course, he never intended to achieve half of it. His was a deft political move designed to declare unity with the left to ensure that, should he ever need swift and decisive support from Democrat-dominated Congress; he would have a good chance of getting it. </p> <p>And in March this year his bridge-building efforts came in very handy, as he was forced to act swiftly to save Bear Stearns from the brink and orchestrate a government bail-out and a quick sale to JP Morgan. The Democrat Congress hardly blinked. Paulson had a free rein.</p> <p>Then in April, with the economy in free fall, Paulson announced a plan for complete reform of the nation's financial regulators. In so doing he transformed the Federal Reserve from an interest-rate obsessed think-tank to a powerful regulator of regulators, with a hand heavy enough to take on Wall Street.</p> <p>But events overtook his plans for reform and all of a sudden, Paulson was in the middle of an economic nightmare. Just as quickly as he had saved Bear Stearns he nationalised Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the twin US mortgage guarantee outfits.</p> <p>He handled the AIG bail-out in person, calling CEO Robert Willumstad last Tuesday night to give him the boot - after a long weekend during which he in effect closed down Lehman Brothers and forced Merrill Lynch to merge with Bank of America.</p> <p>Paulson spurred more corporate M&amp;A activity in five days than he did in an entire career on Wall Street.</p> <p>But there is a growing chorus of detractors in the US who think this type of heavy-handed and inconsistent interventionism will, in the long term, worsen the global crisis. 'America is more communist than China right now,' billionaire investor Jim Rogers fumes in next month's issue of Fortune magazine when asked about Paulson's methods, adding that his interventionism amounted to 'welfare for the rich'.</p> <p>In a speech before Congress earlier this year, Paulson revealed a plan to help Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should they ever need it, and made a prediction: 'If you have a bazooka in your pocket, and people know you have , you may never have to take it out.'</p> <p>On Friday Paulson did, with a bailout package for Wall Street firms worth as much as half a trillion dollars, which could blow great holes in America's public finances if it fails. But if it succeeds it could mark the beginning of the end for America's financial crisis.</p>",
  "<h2>Brand awareness</h2> <p><strong>2006:</strong> Man United chief exec David Gill says the club rejected a \u00a370m shirt sponsorship deal with gambling giant Mansion in favour of AIG's lower bid to 'avoid damaging United's brand'. 'Let's be clear - we passed up the opportunity to do the world's biggest shirt deal to do the right shirt deal.' The board, said club sources, 'were uncomfortable with the idea of children wearing shirts promoting gambling'. United's alternative: children wearing shirts promoting AIG, three months after the insurance giant paid out $1.6bn to settle deception and fraud charges - double the previous record for a fraud case in America. 'AIG 's operations complement our great fanbase,' said Gill. 'This is a blue-chip deal for a blue-chip club.' </p> <h2>Think of the children</h2> <p>Best news from AIG's $85bn US Federal Reserve bailout last week: the survival of their football charity work. Among the best of it: the PR-rich Goals For Kids campaign, launched with United in 2006 - AIG donating pound;1,000 to charity for every goal United scored. 'This program will help nderprivileged children and bring attention to worthy charities,' said AIG's PR. 'We're proud.' <br>\u00b7 \u00a3133,000: Amount raised by Goals For Kids in its launch season. <br>\u00b7 \u00a33.8m ($7m): exit package paid to AIG chief-exec Robert Willumstad last week for three months in charge.

  "<h2>1 York &amp; Albany, London</h2> <p>Gordon Ramsay's ever-growing empire takes a new turn on 29 September with the opening of his first hotel, the York and Albany in Camden, London. This early 19th-century John Nash townhouse has been reworked to provide a restaurant, bar and deli with 10 hotel rooms, two of which are suites overlooking Regents Park. The dining rooms will serve seasonal and uncomplicated dishes, while the deli, in the former stables, will sell cured meats, cheeses, jams and ice creams made on site (perfect for impromptu picnics in the park). Ramsay gave Escape a sneak preview last week, and we can report that it's already looking impressive. The bedrooms, created by British fashion designer Russell Sage, are all highly individual, with dark-wood antiques, lavish bedding, and fabulous old four-posters in some rooms. Ramsay said he'd 'get this one right' before opening more hotels, but let slip he was considering another in Oxford. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong><strong> 127-129 Parkway, London, NW1 7PS; <a href=\"http://www.gordonramsay.com/yorkandalbany\">gordonramsay.com/yorkandalbany</a>; doubles from \u00a3155</strong></p> <h2>2 Rogan and Company, Cumbria</h2> <p>Chef Simon Rogan put the sleepy market town of Cartmel in the Lake District on the map with his Michelin-starred menu at L'Enclume.

  "<p>It was Arthur Koestler, writing during the Second World War, after the existence of the camps became known, who first pointed out that there are limits to the human rights project. Those who described what was going on in places such as Auschwitz-Birkenau were obliged, Koestler lamented, to become 'Screamers'. The Screamers did succeed in reaching listeners, but only momentarily. 'You can convince them for an hour,' Koestler said, 'and their mental half-defence begins to work, and in a week the shrug of incredulity has returned.'</p> <p>For every brutally honest Koestler, however, there have always been others prepared to believe that humans are either basically good or susceptible to persuasion when it comes to saving the world. Frumpy, usually dressed in black, reviled by conservatives as much as she was revered by her progressive followers, Franklin Roosevelt's widow, Eleanor, was in 1948 the most famous woman in American public life. In her weekly radio shows she offered listeners an unceasing flow of upbeat liberal homilies. It was she who presented the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the General Assembly on a winter's day in 1948, in Paris. It's hard not to sense that this was a historic moment. She stresses that the document is not 'a statement of law and legal obligation'; but that it may well become 'the international Magna Carta of all men everywhere'. Most poignant is Eleanor's assertion that human rights are based on what she calls 'a spiritual fact'. Man must have freedom to develop his full stature, she states, 'and through common effort to raise the level of human dignity'.</p> <p>The declaration was one of a number of documents adopted by the newly created UN as part of the postwar effort to save humanity from further bloodshed. It is emphatically a document of its time, making no mention of many things that liberals would now regard as their inalienable rights - to express one's own sexuality by choosing partners of either sex in perfect freedom - and of course no mention of the death penalty and abortion.</p> <p>Much of the declaration reeks of the collectivist, welfarist consensus of the late 1940s. David Cameron and contemporary conservatives would find nothing to object to in its evocation of its importance of the family as the cornerstone of civilisation. Truly striking, however, are the guarantees of free speech, freedom to migrate (as crucial a right for refugees in the 1940s as it is for the world's migrants today), and the basic kit of political freedom that comprises what democrats value in the contemporary world. 'Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers' (Article 19). No one could have put it better, even after all these years of attempts to implement these principles.</p> <p>I wonder what Eleanor would make of our world. She would be astonished by the proliferation of treaties and declarations designed to further the cause, and she would certainly be encouraged by the arrival of a new international style of public life. No non-governmental organisations (NGOs) existed in her lifetime, and we can imagine her as a member of Amnesty or Human Rights Watch. But she might be shocked to discover that the undertakings made in the wake of the mid-century catastrophe hadn't borne much fruit. The killing fields are still open, though they may be more carefully hidden and on a smaller scale. What the poet Robert Lowell called 'the blind swipe of the pruner and his knife' still disturbs the Sabbath rest.</p> <p>In 1948 the Russians sent Andrei Vyshinsky, the judge who had presided over Stalin's show trials, to the UN. He declined to sign the Declaration, referring to it as 'just a collection of pious phrases.' In post-Communist Russia, journalists are killed with impunity. It is still possible to fight wars in the name of peace or human rights - on behalf of the beleaguered South Ossetians - but no one must pretend that this is the real reason for the conflict. Perhaps hypocrisy is on the wane. </p> <p>Meanwhile China has inscribed a commitment to human rights in its constitution. During the Olympics, acting under international pressure, the Chinese created a site in which its citizens might be given official permission to hold demonstrations. Two 70-year-old women wishing to protest that their flat had been torn down were given a year of 're-educative labour', though the sentence was suspended pending their good behaviour. I suppose this is a step forward from the Cultural Revolution in which more than a million Chinese were beaten up, tortured and killed in what historians now see as a bout of state-sponsored anarchy.</p> <p>But what of the Western idea of 'humanitarian intervention' - pioneered in Kosovo and repeated, with less conspicuous success, in Iraq. War was fought in the 1940s in order to save humanity, not to dispose of unwanted minor tyrants. Is it possible to impose democracy when the means involve violating human rights? Nothing in the traditional lexicon of human rights gives any guidance in such matters. </p> <p>As the neocons tell us, parts of the world appear bent on perfecting authoritarian systems. Because of their beliefs, Islamists can have no regard for secular rights. Just as worrying is the assertion (invariably made by those who wish to dispense with them, finding expression in many deeply shocking documents churned out by the UN) that human rights belong to the West, either a rich man's toy or a legacy of imperialists. </p> <p>My own worries are somewhat different. Human rights may simply be a last, ineffectual expression of Samaritanism in a post-Christian world in which suffering is commemorated but no one ever meets the victims. Trying to impose standards by means of pieces of paper which express high humanitarian aims may be what we do when we no longer have the power or the will to engage with the messiness of real politics. Put another way, human rights may merely be a way of appearing to save the world for those who don't want to try too hard to do so. </p> <p>Not long ago, I attended the annual Amnesty human-rights media awards. I've spent much of my career producing films in which atrocities are documented, but I was shocked by the procession of horrors. As one atrocious, unspeakable act after another was brought to light by means of images projected above our heads, it became hard to recall the many courageous journalists, film-makers and activists whose work was being celebrated. Articles about female foeticide were honoured, and there were films (I had indeed been involved with them) about Darfur and the dungeons of George Bush. Index on Censorship was awarded a prize for its expos\u00e9 of the murders of Russian journalists, crimes unpunished and greeted with indifference by the Russian elite. The most touching moment was the award in absentia of a prize to Abdul Karim al-Khaiwani, a Yemeni journalist jailed for 'insulting the President'. It seemed only appropriate that the prize should be given by the BBC's Alan Johnston, fresh from his own imprisonment in Gaza. </p> <p>Chardonnay is served on such occasions, and a glass was in my hand when I encountered a journalist friend from the BBC. He appeared chastened, anxious, and his thoughts mirrored mine. 'So much care goes into the making of these films, the writing of these articles. And people risk their lives,' he said. 'But does anyone actually watch them? Does anyone care?' </p> <p>For the past months, I've tried to answer this question, navigating my way around activists and theorists. I've found many eloquent defenders of human rights. But I notice, too, an impatience with the subject among those whom I interview. 'Yes we know that rights are important,' they wish to say, 'but do we always have to talk about them in a hand-wringing way? Can't we find better news about rights?' And I notice, too, a weary anger when it becomes apparent to both of us that, alas, the news will never be very good. Still, human rights can be exciting. Sir Geoffrey Nice, the man who spent four years of his life trying Slobodan Milosevic, carries the trial around on his laptop. Here is another intelligent human being with whom I can jointly define the nature of contemporary atrocity.</p> <p>But I meet optimists, too. The lawyer and author Geoffrey Robertson speaks out against obscurantists in his book Crimes Against Humanity with the eloquence and gusto of a north London Voltaire. 'There is much more awareness of human rights and we have made a start in enforcing them,' he tells me. In between visits to the Hague, where he's selecting judges for the UN tribunal, he outlines his pet project - a Convention Against Tyranny capable of giving legal justification in order to overthrow evildoers. </p> <p>'At present it would be confined to situations where genocide or widespread murder and torture are being inflicted by state agencies,' he says. 'But there are other forms of barbarism: the Taliban's denial of education to women and girls and execution of homosexuals. Mugabe's destruction of democracy and use of starvation and thuggery as political weapons. That is for the future.'</p> <p>If not beady-eyed, the redoubtable Irene Khan, secretary general of Amnesty, turns out to be nearly as positive. 'You have to think of the Europe of 1938,' she says. 'The biggest European country was ruled by a government that persecuted minorities, arranging \"disappearances\". That would be unthinkable now.' Khan points to all the treaties signed in the past 60 years. 'We don't need any more declarations about rights,' she says. 'The problem is implementation.' She describes to me a world in which a civil society involving millions globally is campaigning on behalf of rights only to find themselves frustrated by politicians. I tell her that I am only partly convinced by this. Politicians are conservative people, but there must be a reason why they are so reluctant to make a stand. </p> <p>We are all agreed, however, when it comes to evoking the damage wrought to the cause of human rights by the so-called war against terror. In the name of national security, America, viewed in 1945 as the sole beacon of a world in darkness, has attempted to re-establish torture as a legitimate method of interrogation, practising it on a substantial scale. Dozens of books chronicle the ineptitude with which the Bush administration stumbled into Iraq. The best is Jane Mayer's The Dark Side, a bestseller in the US. It has yet to find a publisher here. Dip into any chapter and you will find out about 'interrogation' in the new century:</p> <p><strong>'11:15</strong>: Told detainee dog is held in higher esteem... Began to teach detainee lessons such as stay, come and bark...</p> <p><strong>13:00</strong>: Dog tricks continue... Interrogator showed photos of 9-11 victims and told him he should bark happy for these people. Interrogator showed photos of al-Qaeda terrorist and told detainee he should growl at these people. A towel was placed on detainee's head like a burka, and interrogator proceeded to give detainee dance lessons.' </p> <p>The most convincing explanation for the Bush debacle comes from a former top Bush administration lawyer who Mayer quotes. The lawyer, Philip Zelikow, tells her, 'Fear and anxiety were exploited by zealots and fools.' Americans were ready to go along with torture as long as it was called something else. So the lawyers who betrayed America were responding to something more than a public mood. But can we really suppose that these emotions are uniquely American, and that any country, confronted with what is perceived as a threat to its security, won't go the same way? Why should the dark side not prove a common destination in the new century? 'American ideals are undercut by torture. It makes nonsense of our constitutional protections and our claims that all humans have inalienable rights under the law,' Mayer says. 'It hurts the rest of the world, too - because when America forsakes its role as a defender of human rights, it gives licence to tyrannies everywhere.'</p> <p>British governments, too, have been swayed by fear and anxiety. As junior allies we're complicit in what the law lord Johan Steyn called 'the legal black hole of Guant\u00e1namo.' As Conor Gearty, professor of law at the London School of Economics, points out, Anglo-American linkage of human rights and the war against terror has tried to turn them 'into a basis for selective aggression abroad and an alibi for brutality at home'.</p> <p>Another optimist (and international lawyer), Philippe Sands, urges me to take a long view of human rights. He says that rights are the only riposte to the notion, enshrined in European law for centuries, that the state and its representatives have unlimited powers. We should not expect that doctrines adhered to for so long can be overthrown in a year or a decade. Sands was involved in the Pinochet case. He sees the detention of the Chilean dictator as the moment when it was established that for 'crimes against humanity' there should be no frontiers. The law lords did decide that the dictator had a case to answer - not in the country in which the crimes were committed, but where the prosecution was initiated. Home Secretary Jack Straw did return Pinochet to Chile, but the decision was made on health grounds.</p> <p>And yet superpowers do still act to protect themselves, invoking sovereignty. America posed throughout the Cold War as the world's defender of freedoms - but things were different when US citizens might conceivably find themselves prosecuted under international law. Like the Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on Genocide was signed in 1948, after a long, single-handed campaign by Rafael Lemkin, a Polish refugee settled in New York. However, the US Senate declined to ratify the document. Each day the Senate was in session, for 19 years, Senator William Proxmire got to his feet and made a four-minute speech condemning genocide. But it took the charm of Ronald Reagan (and presumably the death of most of the remaining concentration-camp guards in exile somewhere in America) to persuade senators to overcome their objections.</p> <p>As Samantha Power shows in her history of genocide, A Problem from Hell, America proved to be reluctant when it came to preventing genocide. Invariably, it was decided that vital interests were not at stake in the poor, remote countries where killings took place. Officials could then say that it was too late to do anything. Afterwards came the moment to say that it should never happen again. This is what happened in Bosnia, and, most horrifyingly, in Rwanda. With Obama or McCain President, the camps in Guant\u00e1namo will finally be emptied and closed down. But can we expect to see American troops freely used to prevent genocide in places like Darfur? I somehow don't think so.</p> <p>The most important NGO active in human rights remains Amnesty International. It was launched in the pages of this newspaper in 1961 by a London lawyer and a group of fellow liberals. 'The newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence,' Peter Benenson began. Amnesty would seek to adopt individual 'prisoners of conscience', writing letters to the governments which had incarcerated them or encouraging others to do so. </p> <p>Amnesty's aims were carefully limited, and the prisoners adopted came from the West as well as the Communist bloc and the developing world. (Those who advocated violence were not selected, and Amnesty felt ambivalent about Nelson Mandela, first adopting and then rejecting him when he was found guilty of sabotage, although they did acknowledge that people like him might 'feel or find themselves forced into a position in which the only road to freedom is violence...'). Soon letters poured in from a new breed of human-rights activist. Numberless teenagers (myself included) formed Amnesty cells at school. The approach of carefully selecting prisoners, restricting Amnesty's aims, appeared satisfactory.</p> <p>But times changed, and during the 1970s it became possible for Western governments to raise human-rights questions with their Soviet bloc counterparts. In consequence human rights were no longer the sole property of NGOs. As the scope of campaigning increased, those who practised it became more aggressive. In danger of being overtaken by its rivals, Amnesty did move with the times. But it was not until 2003, under Khan's stewardship, that its charter was substantially revised. Amnesty now runs campaigns in relation to the fullest range of 'economic and social rights'. Khan is proud of the recent Stop Violence Against Women in which rape, honour killings, domestic violence and clitoridectomy were targeted.</p> <p>Traditionalists criticised the changes, suggesting that this would make Amnesty indistinguishable from other liberal NGOs. They were upset by the professionalisation of what appeared to be an institution set in its ways. Spread over many floors and located to the east of the city in Shoreditch, as clean-lined as a newly completed city academy, the new Amnesty headquarters is a daunting place, with activists beavering away on each floor. It's hard not to be impressed by so much seriousness. But I find myself surprised, too, by the jolliness of so many working there. Can they really spend each day trying to nudge the immobile Home Office into treating asylum seekers just a little better? Can they remain motivated over the long slog required to get the UN to create some sort of document aimed at limiting the social ravages caused globally by the arms trade? It would appear that somehow they do, though I realise that I would find such diligence testing. </p> <p>However, it's hard here to evade the central contradiction of Amnesty, which is that of the human-rights movement itself. Amnesty still exists by placing in the public eye what, in perfect earnestness, it aims to put an end to. As an institution Amnesty is dedicated to unceasing, endless struggle. I ask a researcher whether the work doesn't get to her. 'Sometimes it does,' says simply. 'But there are compensations.'</p> <p>I can find an echo of such feelings in my own experience. My way into the human-rights maze came via a trap door labelled Srebrenica. A Cry From the Grave is a film which gives an exhaustive, minute-by-minute account of the massacre of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in 1995. The director, Leslie Woodhead, says, 'Like the crimes committed, it won't go away. You can see a version of it now in the town's museum, where the massacre is commemorated.' </p> <p>Geoffrey Nice was the prosecutor in the four-year trial of Slobodan Milosevic at the Yugoslav tribunal in The Hague, and I ask him what he now thinks of the experience. Did he feel cheated when Milosevic died before the proceedings were completed? Lanky, hyperarticulate, Nice is frank and uncomplicated when it comes to admitting that the system is far from perfect. 'It would have been good to secure a conviction, and obviously I wanted one,' he says. 'But the record stands. Anyone who wants to re-establish the reputation of Milosevic will have to contend with what we found out.' But Nice proves to have complex views about prosecuting war criminals. He senses that it is time to abandon the all-out model of Nuremberg, in which a verdict is also a political statement of sorts. We should come to regard international courts as normal, uncontroversial. If it isn't always possible to secure convictions (or indeed to try people, because political considerations make that impossible), maybe we shouldn't worry too much.</p> <p>Only a few years ago Henry Kissinger was shocked when he was presented, via the manager of the Ritz Hotel in Paris, with a legal document asking for his help in sorting out aspects of the Pinochet-era killings in Chile. Unsuccessful attempts have been made in a German court to indict Donald Rumsfeld. I don't think Rumsfeld, or indeed George W Bush, have anything to worry about, even if they do take their holidays in Europe. But in The Hague a few weeks ago, you could choose to see a freshly shaved, suited ex-New Age guru and former Prime Minister of the Republika Srpska Radovan Karadzic appear in court, declining to enter a plea, or watch Charles Taylor, the ex-President of Liberia, fumble with his papers as he watched another witness give an account of his role in the horrifying 10-year civil war. The courtrooms are heavily protected with giant, aquarium-like windows. They're unpicturesquely located in buildings that resemble the headquarters of waste-disposal companies. However, in their anonymity, they are deeply moving places, expressing a determination that impunity should be punished.</p> <p>Many years in the creation, the new International Criminal Court (ICC) was backed by Clinton and melodramatically 'unsigned' by George Bush. Bizarre regulations restrict those who can be tried there to citizens of signatory countries, or cases approved by the UN Security Council. (This means that no Russian, Chinese or American war criminal will ever be brought before the court; indeed the court has been criticised for targeting exclusively offenders from Africa, thus appearing the instrument of neo-imperialism.) But Nice hopes that the US may one day change its mind. 'The real problem with international law is how hard it is to keep independent of politics,' he says. 'Imagine you are running the court, choosing which cases to prosecute. There are war crimes committed everywhere. How do you know which ones to choose? It doesn't mean that you mustn't choose, but it's difficult.'</p> <p>In Albert Camus's short, stinging monologue The Fall (1956), Jean-Baptiste Clamence, a seedy, drunk lawyer, buttonholes a reluctant listener in an Amsterdam bar. On first reading, the book appears to be a perfect-pitch rendering of the worst, smarmiest French intellectual, a man whom vanity impelled towards the humanitarian racket and for whom not believing has become synonymous with honesty. 'It is so late,' Camus's cynic tells his interlocutor as he strives to avoid falling into a canal. 'One is always too late.' Latterly, however, I've begun to appreciate the text in a different fashion. Depressed when he wrote The Fall, Camus began to ask himself a simple question. What would happen to us all if, while, pretending that the lives of others mattered, we ceased to act as if they did? The answer is that we would, like Camus's ex-judge, no longer think of ourselves as human beings. </p> <p>Inevitably the human-rights narrative comes readily peopled with good victims and evil perpetrators. It abounds in worthy clich\u00e9s. My own plea is that in films or articles, human rights politics should be depicted like anything else - not in black and white, as slogans or in pop lyrics, but with the right component of muted, real-life greys. Think of the unassuming, wholly remarkable Canadian Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, who commanded the ill-fated UN force in Rwanda and refused to leave the country. Years later he was found drunk and weeping on a park bench. It appears that Dallaire never recovered from his experiences in Rwanda, though he was always ready to say that his own sufferings were nothing beside the ones he had witnessed. But Dallaire's sense of guilt and complicity proved embarrassing to the media covering his story. For reasons that were never discussed, he never seemed an appropriate protagonist.</p> <p>I also feel that human-rights activists should no longer be sniffy about what Irene Khan calls 'principled pragmatism'. This was the message of Sergio Vieira de Mello, a student of Camus and existentialist philosophy, and the most effective, most dedicated fighter for rights in our time. Brazilian, the son of a diplomat, Sergio began his UN career with a belief that laws and resolutions alone would stop the killing. Speedily disabused, despising the ponderous UN bureaucracy in which he needed to survive, he went to the opposite extreme of seeking to conciliate killers, in the forlorn hope of getting them to behave better. However, it would seem that Sergio's view of the world, too, was altered by Srebrenica. Appointed to the despised, underfunded post of UN Commissioner for Human Rights, he began to read feverishly. </p> <p>He began to see that human rights, far from being an optional extra, to be discarded when they weren't useful, were essential. They were the new global 'rule of law'. Abstractions such as peace and security made sense only if states treated their citizens properly - and were prepared to extend such rights to the citizens of other states. But he also thought that human-rights culture had wrongly neglected the notion of dignity. Freedoms meant nothing if people could have no sense of their own worth. And maybe flawed states with a minimum of democratic practices but some legal rights were better than the pseudo-democracies magicked into existence by an overeager West in the post-communist perception that history had ended. In East Timor, where he ran the UN mission, he was able to put these views into practice, with success.</p> <p>Sergio refused to criticise the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Alone among humanitarians, he was able to meet with George Bush and criticise the American treatment of detainees. He went to Baghdad in the certain expectation that his UN mission would prove to be a failure. On 19 August 2003 he died after a car bomb exploded, turning the UN headquarters into rubble. Charismatic, sexually attractive, Sergio enjoyed life and had no taste for martyrdom - he was just doing what had to be done. He died, as his biographer Samantha Power says, 'buried beneath the weight of the UN itself'. </p> <p>Sergio's last words, spoken to a rescuer eager to give him spiritual comfort, were: 'Fuck God, just get me out of here.' Human rights are indeed a matter of life and death. I can't think of a better slogan for our times than Sergio's.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> To read an edited version of the 1961 Observer article by Peter Benenson that launched Amnesty, go to <a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/52o6eu\">tinyurl.com/52o6eu</a></p> <h2>The United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights</h2> <p>This is an edited version of the rights enshrined in the 1948 declaration's 30 Articles</p> <p><strong>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.</p> <p><strong>No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.</strong></p> <p>No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p> <p><strong>Everyone is equal before the law.</strong></p> <p>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.</p> <p><strong>Everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in the [event] of any criminal charge against him.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to privacy and to protection by the law from attacks upon his honour and reputation.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to seek asylum from persecution.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to a nationality.</strong></p> <p>Men and women, irrespective of race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and found a family.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to own property.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.</p> <p><strong>No one may be compelled to belong to an association.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country.</strong></p> <p>The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government.

  "<p>Gordon Brown is set to lead Labour into an election bloodbath so crushing it could take his party a decade to recover, according to the largest ever poll of marginal seats which predicts a landslide victory for David Cameron.</p> <p>Eight cabinet ministers, including the Home Secretary and the Justice Secretary, would be swept away in the rout as the Tories marched into Downing Street with a majority of 146, says the poll, conducted for <a href=\"http://www.PoliticsHome.com\">PoliticsHome.com</a> and exclusively revealed to The Observer. Seats that have been Labour since the First World War would fall. </p> <p>The sheer scale of the humiliation is almost as bad as that endured by the Tories in 1997, suggesting it could take Labour a similar time to claw its way back to power. The party would be virtually extinguished in southern England and left with only its hardcore redoubts in northern England, the Welsh valleys and deprived inner-city areas.</p> <p>The stark findings from the survey of almost 35,000 voters across 238 seats, published on the PoliticsHome website today, are likely to fuel the stalled insurrection against Brown. A third of potential Labour voters in marginal seats would be more likely to back the party if he were replaced.</p> <p>Intriguingly, the findings also suggest David Miliband's hopes of leading Labour may depend on him challenging Brown before the election.</p> <p>While the Foreign Secretary would survive the rout, his power base would be decimated, making it much harder for him to get elected in a party likely to have shifted to the left: cabinet allies James Purnell and John Hutton would have gone, along with senior Blairites Alan Milburn and Charles Clarke.

The title, now bankrolled by Labour-affiliated unions, has been handed emergency funds to keep it solvent over the weekend until its owners can examine the books, but it seems unlikely new investment will follow. Tribune editor Chris McLaughlin tells Diary: 'The short term will be fine. But they haven't done enough to underwrite the long-term future.' Perhaps it would be better off in private hands. </p> <h2>Royal appointment </h2> <p>Interesting to see glossy weekly Grazia has signed up Mary 'Queen of Shops' Portas, the fashion consultant whose TV series made her a household name. Portas's live-in partner, Melanie Rickey, is the title's fashion features editor.</p> <h2>Pregnant pause</h2> <p>Is Robert Peston the new Simon Cowell? Both men have luxuriant heads of suspiciously jet-black hair, of course and, last week, the BBC business editor was on the box even more often than Cowell. As the global financial system went into meltdown, Peston clocked up an incredible 79 appearances on TV, (38 on Wednesday alone), and was mentioned in the national press 32 times. He also wrote more than 6,000 words on his BBC blog, and dominated the airwaves to boot. But spare a thought for Stephanie Flanders, the BBC's erudite new economics editor, whose absence explains Peston's omnipresence; she is on maternity leave during the biggest economic story of her lifetime. </p> <h2>Logos and own goals</h2> <p>The press football team take on the government at Manchester United's academy this morning, with cabinet ministers Ed Balls, Andy Burnham and James Purnell determined to score a rare victory against their journalistic tormentors.

Given last week's bail-out of United's current backer, AIG, the Reds may soon be negotiating a new deal themselves. </p> <h2>Bun's not hot any more</h2> <p>An interesting filing at Companies House reveals that a certain Keith Rupert Murdoch has stepped down as a director of News Group Newspapers, the News International subsidiary that publishes its red-top titles. His youngest son, James, was appointed to run the family's UK newspaper business last year, but Murdoch had stayed on as a director, and his affection for the titles is well-documented. Murdoch Sr is now spending much of his time revamping the Wall Street Journal, so does his resignation signal that his hot love for the 'Currant Bun' is cooling?</p>",
  "<p>At last - a column about Katrina Amy Alexandria Alexis Infield, aka Katie Price, aka Jordan, aka Mrs Peter Andre. I've put it off on the basis that whenever I feel compelled to grapple with this most potent of cultural phenomena (almost daily) I think, 'No, Flett - something even more fabulous will happen to Katie next week...' And lo it invariably comes to pass. </p> <p>But she's just been profiled by the New York Times, and has therefore conquered not only LA, which would presumably be her spiritual home, but arguably the most sophisticated metropolis on the planet, and thus it feels like the moment to attempt to take stock of the former seducer of Gareth Gates while six months pregnant turned full-time working wife and mother-of-three (Harvey, Junior and Princess), 'author' of 24 books (11 in the Perfect Ponies series, six in the Mermaids and Pirates ditto, three novels and four volumes of autobiography...), lifelong horse-owner who has recently started competing at dressage (for which you need to be a very good rider), occasional singer and former Eurovision contestant, 'designer' of equestrian wear (very pink with a fabulously camp coat-of-arms style logo featuring a horse's bridle bit, a crown and a heart, the collection is strong on velour hoodies (\u00a344.99), but, bafflingly, there's not a pair of jodhpurs), 'designer' of bedlinen (for Matalan; pink, hearts, blah...), creator of her signature scent (Katie Price Stunning for Her, RRP \u00a334, with top notes of mandarin and bergamot), reality contestant, presenter of chat shows, bastion of OK! magazine and wannabe-global brand, worth an estimated \u00a330m and counting.</p> <p>I logged on to katieprice.co.uk but it's subscription-only, and fascinated by her though I am, 25 quid to take a peek at Katie's blog when I can pay a lot less for any issue of OK! (or indeed absolutely nothing to find out what she thinks about Jade Goody's cancer via any number of websites - 'I feel sorry for anyone who's going through what Jade's going through. But I can't believe she is paid for interviews on subjects that people are really traumatised by. I saw her on Celebrity Big Brother and thought she was a racist. She didn't give people sympathy when she was on the show...') feels just a tiny bit surplus to requirements, however on one of the site's few all-areas-access pages, Katie describes herself as 'a celebrity glamour model and [her italics] a caring, loving mother and family member', which is barely the half of it, frankly. </p> <p>It is hard to pin down the essence of why Britain, and now apparently the US, has completely fallen for Katie, but obviously the tipping point was I'm a Celebrity... when flighty Jordan, the silicone-enhanced single mother and serial faller-out-of-nightclubs was revealed to be made of sterner stuff than we'd imagined, unafraid of eating witchetty grubs in a bikini while falling in love with a washed-up Aussie pop star. As a re-branding exercise, this was on a scale that would have challenged Madonna, and was all the more successful for being both utterly unexpected and (apparently) entirely unselfconscious - though Katie has always been the mistress of her own destiny, I don't think even she could have envisaged that her (roughly) 273 per cent male fan base would, in less than five years, undergo such radical gender reassignment that (according to her management) the traffic on katieprice.co.uk website is now 85 per cent female.</p> <p>I'm very conflicted about Katie, on the grounds that she is patently a post-feminist nightmare/wet dream. I respect her savvy ability as a personal brand manager and understand the motivation to flog every last bit of herself (those used breast implants can still be yours for the right price - recycling is not recommended - while her soul will be available to the highest bidder circa 2070), if only on the grounds that it represents consumerism's last hurrah. </p> <p>But inevitably I despair at the fact that Ms Price is also a role model for a certain sort of seven year old with a princess fetish and/or a lust for fame who imagines that growing up to acquire big boobs, lots of money and a buff husband will equate to everlasting happiness. And you know why that really annoys me? Because it's obviously true...</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:kathryn.flett@observer.co.uk\">kathryn.flett@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>How naive many of us were last autumn to have thought that the collapse of Northern Rock and the onset of the credit crunch would wash through the system in nine to 12 months and then it would be back to business as usual, with the banks having put their houses in order after a stern dressing-down from politicians and regulators.</p> <p>Last week's tumultuous events on the financial markets tell us something quite different: that the world is a hugely changed place and that the legacy of the near meltdown of the global financial system will be with us for a long time to come.</p> <p>In a just a few days, we witnessed the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression although, thankfully, confidence has been temporarily restored by the swift and decisive action of politicians and central bankers, who have learnt a thing or two from the 1930s when the authorities displayed extraordinary ineptitude.</p> <p>The changes afoot are both geopolitical and financial. Confirmation that one of Wall Street's most pre-eminent investment banks, Morgan Stanley, headed by John Mack, is in talks about selling a 49 per cent stake to the China Investment Corporation is a development that is rich in symbolism. </p> <p>Communist China, the new superpower of the East, is coming to the rescue of capitalist America, which must pick up the tab for years of reckless lending by the banks, consumer excess and light-touch regulation that allowed the explosion of derivatives to go unchallenged and which brought the world economy to the brink of disaster. </p> <p>China has accumulated billions in foreign reserves while America has effectively bankrupted itself; it cannot be long before the Chinese are welcomed into the US to buy stricken assets that were previously considered national icons - General Motors and Ford look particularly vulnerable. </p> <p>In a nutshell, the crisis has underlined the fact that US power is ebbing away and that free market fundamentalism has become an ideology that is beginning to look as outdated as the Leninist doctrine of democratic centralism. The financial repercussions will be no less far-reaching. Just consider what has happened over the last seven days: HBOS, the biggest mortgage bank in Britain looked as if it could go down, while Wall Street was shaken to its foundations by the demise or rescue of leading investment banks: Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Bear Stearns, led by Jimmy Cayne, you may remember, disappeared after the Federal Reserve engineered a rescue by JP Morgan back in March. </p> <p>With luck, American Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's plan for Washington to remove bad debt from US bank balance sheets will restore calm - and some semblance of stability. (It will be interesting to see how much pressure the British government will come under to take similar measures here.)</p> <p>But banks will still be reluctant to lend, as they must rebuild their balance sheets and meet new, tougher capital requirements that are being drawn up to prevent a repeat of the credit crunch in future. That means the cost of debt will remain high for businesses and mortgage borrowers. Credit will be sucked out of the economy, stifling economic growth. Without a strong and vibrant financial sector, a modern economy cannot function properly and the wheels of commerce are bound to turn more slowly; a contraction of credit will dent consumer spending, prevent businesses from expanding and lead to a rising tide of bankruptcies. </p> <p>When the cycle turns, however, banks are going to behave very differently. They will be more risk-averse, which is a good thing if it means an end to irresponsible lending; and they will be regulated more heavily than at any time since the Second World War. Again, that will be a plus, as what the crisis has demonstrated is that banks cannot be left to their own devices.</p> <p>In particular, financial products such as derivatives will need to be vetted and approved. Why should we not require the same level of safety from our banks as from the makers of home appliances such as kettles, to ensure that they don't blow up in our faces?</p> <p>Although short-sellers aggravated an already fragile trading environment, HBOS and the American insurance group AIG, rescued by the US authorities last week, ran into trouble because they strayed into the uncharted territory of credit default swaps, collateralised debt obligations, mortgage-backed securities and other exotic products. That allowed them to expand their business by creating a huge new industry that gorged on itself, but it was one that was built around 'funny money' because - in the end - many of these weird and wonderful instruments weren't worth the paper they were written on.</p> <p>Heavily regulated, the reformed banks - possibly shorn of a bonus culture that has encouraged greed and short-termism and which played a major role in bringing about both a credit boom and housing bust - will inevitably make less profit, but this will be a boon for financial stability and restore prosperity. Sadly, we are not there yet: Paulson's $1 trillion bail-out of the banks looks like a masterstroke, but it carries considerable risk as it undermines the US balance sheet and could lead to another precipitous fall in the value of the dollar and, with it, a further decline in US prestige. </p> <p>Finally, there is the sickly housing market on both sides of the Atlantic. It lies at the heart of the current global financial firestorm, and there are few signs that we have reached the bottom. This is a crisis where there simply aren't any quick fixes. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.</p>",
  "<h2>Russia</h2> <p>Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's popularity rests on Russia's impressive economic growth in recent years, built largely on exploiting its natural resources. As President, he bought many privatised gas and oil companies back under government control, and rising energy prices have boosted state coffers. But there are fears that banks have lent too much and last week stock market trading was suspended three times as shares crashed and then bounced back dramatically. The RTS Index has fallen by half this year, making it one of the worst performers globally, and anxiety about the invasion of Georgia is also undermining confidence. Russia's central bank last week provided the three major banks - Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank - with $44bn in emergency funding to improve liquidity. But the country's finances are in much better shape now than 10 years ago, when it defaulted on its international debts and triggered a global financial crisis, forcing the IMF to bail it out. Today, there is nearly $600bn in central bank reserves. </p> <p><strong>China</strong></p> <p>According to the economic theory of 'decoupling', China, with other emerging industrial powerhouses in the developing world, could continue to drive global growth in the event of an American slowdown. That analysis is now being tested at a time when China's expansion - its GDP has grown by around 10 per cent or more this decade - appears to be slowing. </p> <p>Last week, it cut interest rates for the first time in six years, despite fears about inflation, demonstrating it is concerned about the effects of falling US demand. It will be hit hard if its customers in the industrialised nations spend less, and there have already been factory closures. Growth rates for exports and incomes for city-dwellers are also down from last year - the latter tumbled from 14.2 per cent in the first six months of 2007 to 6.3 per cent in the equivalent period this year. But growing domestic demand could keep the economy afloat; Chinese retail sales are rising by about 20 per cent a year. </p> <p><strong>Brazil</strong></p> <p>Until last week, it was business as usual in Brazil. Foreign investors regarded it as a safe haven, attracted by an expanding affluent class and the most stable economic conditions for a decade. While the London stock market shrank by 1.5 per cent during 2007, its S\u00e3o Paulo counterpart expanded by 93 per cent on a flood of foreign investment. </p> <p>But, last Wednesday, the S\u00e3o Paulo stock exchange tumbled 6.74 per cent amid a sell-off that battered financial stocks, and fears that foreign investors will sell their Brazilian assets. Shares in house builders plummeted on expectation that credit will now be harder to come by and the booming housing market will grind to a halt, and economists warned that growth rate in the biggest Latin American economies would fall by at least one percentage point as a result of the fallout from the US crisis. </p> <p><strong>The eurozone</strong></p> <p>The ECB pumped \u20ac100bn into the financial system last week in a bid to ensure there are no banking collapses on the continent to mirror those in the US and the UK. The biggest eurozone countries have so far remained relatively unscathed, although some are more vulnerable than others. In Spain and Ireland, property bubbles burst before the crisis in the US sub-prime market, and both countries are likely to slip into recession. But the largest eurozone countries, Germany and France, are partly buttressed by more cautious lending and tighter restrictions on personal credit. Although the global slowdown will restrict economic growth, Germany's BdB, which represents the country's private banks, said last week: 'There is no statistical evidence of a credit crunch in Germany.' </p> <p><strong>Japan</strong></p> <p>Japan has already experienced a credit crunch, triggered when a real-estate crash in the early Nineties revealed the extent of the exposure to the country's collapsing commercial property market. If the 1929 Wall Street Crash provides governments with a useful guide to how not to handle an economic crisis, Japan's financial implosion also gives them a more recent example. </p> <p>The failure of Lehman Brothers' Japanese arm constitutes the country's second-largest bankruptcy ever, but officials insist there is little danger of history repeating itself. Bank of Japan governor Masaaki Shirakawa down- played concern that the US crisis will hurt the world's second-largest economy and said Japan's financial system remains stable. 'Most lending to Lehman Brothers was made by major Japanese banks and their potential losses seem to be within the levels that can be covered by their profits,' he said.</p> <p>After the Nineties crisis, it was nearly a decade before Japanese banks began to lend freely to each other. Policymakers in the West will be hoping that America can recover far more quickly.</p>",
  "<p>As panic-stricken City bankers streamed out of Canary Wharf with boxes of belongings, many ordinary Britons watching them on the TV may have enjoyed a touch of schadenfreude - but the desperate state of the housing market since the credit crunch began a year ago is a reminder that when banks are in trouble, others suffer too.</p> <p>Job losses in the UK economy were mounting fast, even before thousands of staff were laid off at Lehman Brothers' London headquarters last week. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits jumped by an alarming 32,500 in August, according to the latest official figures - the largest monthly rise since 1992, underlining how rapidly the travails of the financial sector are spreading through the economy. Since January, the claimant count has risen by 110,000.</p> <p>The direct impact of the turmoil will hit the coffee shops and bars of Canary Wharf and the City, and the estate agents of Knightsbridge, as bankers who have lost their jobs - or fear that they might - cut back on spending. </p> <p>But the indirect impact is likely to be more pernicious and much longer-lasting. As the banks have been hit by massive losses, and struggled to fund themselves in the wholesale markets on which many had come to depend, they have begun to tighten up on lending - to all of us.</p> <p>Mortgages have become scarcer and more expensive; and businesses, too, are beginning to find it harder to raise loans. Just as Britain's heady economic boom of the past decade was fuelled by rapidly expanding debt, now that the credit taps are being turned off, consumers and businesses across the UK will be hit.</p> <p>Most economists believe this is only the beginning of a prolonged period of weakness. Dramatic events in financial markets often play out at breakneck speed, as last week's roller-coaster ride of corporate collapses and last-ditch takeovers illustrated; but in the wider economy, crises can take much longer to unfold.</p> <p>'This highlights the fact that it's going to go on for a lot longer than people expected,' says Howard Archer, UK economist at Global Insight. 'Obviously, the credit crunch has deepened. The banks are going to be even more reluctant to lend, and that's going to make mortgages even more expensive.'</p> <p>House prices are already down by more than 10 per cent from their peak last year, according to the Nationwide measure; and the number of homes being bought and sold each month has fallen by almost a half.</p> <p>There had been signs that the crisis was easing in the past fortnight, with a number of lenders reducing their rates. But the renewed outbreak of panic about the health of Britain's banks is likely to push up costs again, exacerbating the property slowdown.</p> <p>There is a fierce debate among economists, including those at the Bank of England, about how seriously falling house prices will affect consumer spending and the wider economy. So far, official figures show high street sales holding up surprisingly well; but a number of retailers have already shown signs of distress. With Britain's households sitting on the biggest debts in the G7, as a proportion of their income, few analysts believe most of us will be shopping for much longer.</p> <p>Business borrowers are unlikely to be immune to the squeeze either, as banks battle to get their finances in order. The Bank of England suggested in its August inflation report that many businesses were calling on long-established credit lines; once those are exhausted, they may find it hard to fund new investment.</p> <p>'It's going to be difficult for small businesses to borrow. With the economy slowing so much anyway, investment intentions were already being scaled back; but nevertheless, some firms which want to borrow will not be able to,' says Archer. He is predicting that the economy will shrink for three successive quarters, beginning now; and expand by just 0.1 per cent next year.</p> <p>So concerned was the Bank of England about the potential consequences of the turmoil, that it announced a three-month extension to the emergency Special Liquidity Scheme, which has allowed banks to swap hard-to-sell mortgage-backed assets with government bonds. Some estimates suggest banks may already have drawn down an extraordinary \u00a3200bn. Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, had said only the previous week that he had no intention of renewing the scheme, which was due to expire in mid-October.</p> <p>Although the buyout of HBOS by Lloyds illustrates the seriousness of the problems facing the City, some analysts believe it could eventually help the economy recover, because banks face major losses from the ongoing housing downturn - and with the credit boom over, the financial sector will need to shrink.</p> <p>'Weak, poorly funded institutions have been snapped up by the healthier and more profitable \"clearing banks\", a major step in \"getting the UK's house in order\",' says Jamie Dannhauser, of Lombard Street Research.</p> <p>However, he adds that it will be essential for the Bank of England to cut interest rates, to help limit banks' losses. 'The over-riding policy risk is that the monetary policy committee leaves monetary conditions too tight, for too long.'</p> <p>Minutes from the September meeting of the MPC, released last week, showed a gentle shift towards a rate cut. Unlike August, there were no votes for increasing rates; and David Blanchflower, the labour market specialist who has long argued that the Bank is too worried about inflation, and not enough about the risks to growth, cast his vote for a half-point reduction. 'They're creeping towards cutting rates,' says Archer.</p> <p>Borrowing costs have been on hold at 5 per cent since April, as the Bank frets about the inflationary impact of high energy prices and the falling pound. But Graham Turner, of GFC Economics, agrees that without much lower rates, any relief from bank rescues - or the billions of dollars pumped into the markets last week - will be short-lived. </p> <p>He recalls the 'lost decade' in Japan in the Nineties, when one struggling bank after another was merged with a stronger rival in a 'convoy' of takeovers, but the central bank failed to cut rates in earnest until the crisis was well under way, and the losses just continued getting worse. 'This is exactly what happened in Japan, and I just can't believe we're reliving the whole thing over again: it just beggars belief,' he says.</p> <p>Back in the City last week, headhunters were deluged with calls from bankers keen to find themselves another berth. Jonathan Evans, chairman of executive search firm Sammons Associates, says, 'I haven't seen anything like the events of the past few days. It's incredible the speed at which it has happened. But it's better this way - Bear Stearns dragged on for months and was very painful. </p> <p>'A lot of people are going to find themselves on the street and won't be able to find homes,' he said. 'I'm talking to people back-to-back. I'm sure there will be more jobs cuts before Christmas.'</p>",
  "<p>Mid-haul destinations are the latest travel hotspots, according to Thomson and First Choice's new Trends Report 2008-09.</p> <p>More than one fifth of holidays taken with Thomson and First Choice in 2007 were outside Europe, as opposed to just 15 per cent in 2003 and the number is set to rise further in 2009. </p> <p>Market research company Mintel also confirmed the increasing popularity of countries such as Turkey, Morocco, Egypt and Middle Eastern destinations including Dubai, Oman and the other Emirates thanks to their mix of guaranteed warmth, lower prices and a touch more exoticism than familiar destinations in the Med. </p> <p>'It's happening across the board,' says Richard Cope, senior travel analyst at Mintel. 'The euro is a big factor - people were sheltered this summer by brochure prices which were fixed at the beginning of the year, but prices will rise for 2009, meaning people will look increasingly at countries outside the eurozone. And the new Easyjet routes into Morocco and Turkey have also made them more accessible.

'Egypt is currently fourth in our top 20 global luxury destinations - pretty impressive for one of the oldest tourist destinations on earth.'</p>",
  "<p>A year ago, Halifax was offering customers of Lloyds TSB \u00a3100 to swap to one of its current accounts. Last week, Lloyds TSB said it was shelling out around \u00a3600 for every one of the 22 million customers of Halifax and Bank of Scotland in a \u00a313.2bn takeover of the HBOS banking giant.</p> <p>This is not an expensive case of tit for tat: rather it is a potent symbol of the impact the credit crunch is having on the banking industry. As recently as a month ago, a merger between HBOS and Lloyds TSB would have been unthinkable: together, they will have 28 per cent of the mortgage market, operate one in three current accounts held by British consumers and own two of the strongest brands in life assurance in Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical. Yet the Office of Fair Trading, which blocked Lloyds TSB's attempt to acquire the much smaller Abbey National seven years ago, has been forced by the government to wave this deal through.</p> <p>While HBOS chairman Lord Stevenson angrily rebuffed suggestions that the bank was on its knees, the haste with which the deal was stitched up - encouraged and aided by the government and the Financial Services Authority - reflected serious concerns that Britain's biggest mortgage lender could be forced out of business. And while its senior executives were touring the television studios insisting that it had plenty of capital, the City was sending its shares spiralling to a low of just 88p, a third of the price at which it issued new shares as recently as July and a fraction of the 1,165p achieved little over a year ago.</p> <p>While there was no immediate danger of its running out of money, more than half of its funding provisions- a colossal \u00a3156bn - was due to mature within a year. With financial markets in turmoil following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the effective nationalisation of AIG, investors were betting that, even if it could roll over those facilities, it would be at exorbitant rates. And investors had shunned its \u00a34bn capital-raising in July so were unlikely to be responsive to another rights issue. That left it dangerously exposed.</p> <p>It also left Eric Daniels, the urbane American chief executive of Lloyds TSB, with the opportunity of a lifetime. Having spent most of his five years at the helm selling assets and restoring Lloyds' reputation following the ill-conceived purchase of Scottish Widows, he was on the acquisition trail. His interest in acquiring Northern Rock last year foundered on a lack of government support; he had considered Bradford &amp; Bingley and Alliance &amp; Leicester but they were too small to make a real difference, even without the concerns about their buy-to-let lending and risky financial structures. </p> <p>He had held talks with HBOS during the summer but any deal would have been referred immediately to the Competition Commission - and, with the markets in their febrile state, he would not contemplate subjecting the bank to that long period of uncertainty. </p> <p>All that changed last week when Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Victor Blank met Gordon Brown at a Citigroup reception in Canary Wharf on Monday; Blank was left in little doubt that the government viewed a banking monopoly as preferable to another Northern Rock-style nationalisation fiasco and would give its nod to any deal. Talks between the two banks resumed and, with HBOS's shares in freefall, the announcement was rushed out on Thursday morning.</p> <p>Sir Victor said that both customers and employees would benefit from 'being part of this great enterprise'. Both these parties are unconvinced. HBOS's aggressive attempts to win banking customers from the Big Four - a strategy pioneered by HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby when he was head of the bank's retail business - had brought big benefits in the shape of high interest current accounts, attractive deals for small businesses and generous mortgage promises. Consumer watchdogs think these deals will quickly disappear from the merged business.</p> <p>Daniels told The Observer yesterday that he expected there to be big opportunities to boost the revenue of the combined group. 'With our big distribution network and complementarity of branches I think we can serve customers extremely well.' </p> <p>But analysts fear that attrition is more likely: combined, the two groups already have relationships with four consumers out of 10 and it is likely that these have already been subject to concerted attempts at cross-selling.</p> <p>Employees, too, are worried. While Daniels dismissed suggestions that 40,000 of the 140,000 combined workforce could go, he has said he expects to cut around 10 per cent, or \u00a31bn, of costs, implying 14,000 redundancies. The City believes that is far too conservative - RBS cut 20 per cent of costs when it acquired the admittedly much less efficient NatWest. The slump in the mortgage market means that HBOS was already shedding jobs and more were expected to go even before the merger.</p> <p>The alliance has not solved HBOS's capital problems - instead, it has made Lloyds TSB's position worse. The new bank's 'tier 1' capital ratios - a key measure of its financial strength - will be just 5.9 per cent, short of the 6 per cent level preferred by Lloyds TSB. 'That is a bit below where I would like it to be,' says Chris White, banking specialist at Threadneedle Asset Management. 'I cannot rule out their raising capital in the future, which would dilute some of the gains.'</p> <p>Lloyds seems to agree: it took the opportunity of Friday's market bounce to place 5 per cent of its shares, raising \u00a3767m. And, much to the chagrin of investors who have stuck with its shares for their generous dividend yield, it has said it will rebase its payout to 40 per cent of earnings - last year it paid out more than 60 per cent of its earnings - and will distribute this year's dividend in shares rather than cash.</p> <p>Nor has it solved the short-term funding problem: while Lloyds got more than 60 per cent of its funding from customers' savings and deposits, HBOS's proportion was just 52 per cent and that means the combined group will still rely on the wholesale markets for about 45 per cent of its financing. The ratio of loans to assets of the group will also be relatively high, at around 160 per cent, reflecting HBOS's more aggressive approach.</p> <p>'They will have to continue the process of selling assets and deleveraging the HBOS balance sheet,' says White. </p> <p>But he is enthusiastic about the deal. 'I take my hat off to Eric. He has transformed the Lloyds TSB business and created a strong institution. This is the opportunity he has been waiting for.'</p> <p>While, on the face of it, the price it is paying seems cheap - at around \u00a313bn in Lloyds TSB shares, it is only around half the book value of HBOS's assets - White expects that significant write-downs in the value of HBOS's assets will slash that book value. These are likely to be focused on the property and private equity portfolios built up by Peter Cummings and his corporate team through the funding of everything from Wembley Stadium to backing Sir Philip Green.</p> <p>While Daniels said he was excited about the idea of combining the private equity business with his own Development Capital arm, and was sanguine about the extent of the two banks' \u00a360bn property exposure, analysts expect a dramatic scaling-back of the level of risk in the combined group. </p> <p>These kind of exposures were another key reason for the City's nervousness about HBOS shares - and for dissatisfaction with the performance of its chief executive. While the aggressive expansion into high-risk areas like buy-to-let mortgages and leveraged finance began under his predecessor Sir James Crosby, Hornby stands accused of failing to recognise the risks quickly enough and position the bank for the new, more risk-averse, climate. Dubbed the 'wonder kid' when he got the top job in 2006 aged less than 40, he was poached from Asda and has a retailing background. </p> <p>'Management has not come out of this well,' says one leading investor. 'It was more vulnerable than its competitors and management must take the blame for that and the fact that they have sold out at what will be deemed to be a very low level.</p> <p>'Hornby carried on regardless [after succeeding Crosby] when, if he had been concerned about the strategy, he had ample time to do something about it. I would be very surprised if he gets a senior role in the new organisation.'</p> <p>Daniels refuses to be drawn on the role Hornby or any of the HBOS executives will play in the combined bank - although he insists Hornby will still be around in a year's time. 'I have the highest respect for his skills,' he says.</p> <p>In turn, Blank describes the deal as a 'landmark day' for the financial services industry. 'It is a unique opportunity to create the largest and best financial services group in Britain,' he says. Once the deal has been bedded down, he holds out the prospect of using the group's financial muscle to expand overseas.</p> <p>But the immediate challenge is to meld the two parts while steering the group through the worst financial crisis in a century. If it succeeds, it will be - as Daniels claims - a 'wonderful franchise'. But the penalties for failure will be high.</p> <h2>Demolition of the building societies</h2> <p>Before it added TSB to its name, Lloyds kicked off the fad for building society demutualisations when it acquired Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester in 1995. That sparked a rush to the stock market as six former societies floated - spurred on by 'carpet-bagging' members salivating over the prospect of large windfalls - while four more were acquired by rival banks.</p> <p>Ironically, Lloyds TSB's acquisition of HBOS has also effectively marked the end of its dalliance with the market. A few days before that deal was announced, Alliance &amp; Leicester secured approval for its takeover by Spanish bank Banco Santander, which already owns former society Abbey National.</p> <p>With the Woolwich now part of Barclays and Northern Rock in government hands, that leaves Bradford &amp; Bingley as the sole remaining former building society on the stock market - and the consensus is that it, too, will be acquired as soon as new chief executive Richard Pym has tidied up its operations. </p> <p>While customers who sold out quickly will have made healthy sums, those who held on, believing that stock markets are for the long term, will be bitterly regretting it. Halifax (which merged with Bank of Scotland to become HBOS) shares were worth 732.5p when it demutualised 11 years ago and reached a peak of 1165p a year ago: Lloyds TSB's offer values the shares at around 215p. Santander's all-share offer for A&amp;L is worth around 263p, less than half the 542.5p price when it floated; Northern Rock's shares climbed from 500p to a peak of more than 1200p last spring before nationalisation this year effectively made them worthless; Bradford &amp; Bingley's shares stand at little over a tenth of their 248p demutualisation price.</p> <p>The former societies that succumbed early have fared better: Abbey National's shareholders received the equivalent of 650p from Santander compared with a 100p flotation price, while Barclays paid 352p for the Woolwich compared with 296.5p at demutualisation. </p> <p>Stock market pressure on these former societies to deliver constantly rising profits is one factor behind the credit crunch. Bigger profits generally mean offering bigger loans to more people; to finance that, the banks sought new sources of funds, such as securitisations and money market borrowings, rather than relying on depositors. These bigger loans drove up house prices, encouraging more borrowing by banks and their customers. It is that process which is being rather painfully unravelled.</p>",
  "<p>Jorgen Tranberg looks a farmer to his roots: grubby blue overalls, crumpled T-shirt and crinkled, weather-beaten features. His laconic manner, blond hair and black clogs also reveal his Scandinavian origins. Jorgen farms at Norreskifte on Samso, a Danish island famed for its rich, sweet strawberries and delicately flavoured early potatoes. This place is steeped in history - the Vikings built ships and constructed canals here - while modern residents of Copenhagen own dozens of the island's finer houses.</p> <p>But Samso has recently undergone a remarkable transformation, one that has given it an unexpected global importance and international technological standing. Although members of a tightly knit, deeply conservative community, Samsingers - with Jorgen in the vanguard - have launched a renewable-energy revolution on this windswept scrap of Scandinavia. Solar, biomass, wind and wood-chip power generators have sprouted up across the island, while traditional fossil-fuel plants have been closed and dismantled. Nor was it hard to bring about these changes. 'For me, it has been a piece of cake,' says Jorgen. Nevertheless, the consequences have been dramatic.</p> <p>Ten years ago, islanders drew nearly all their energy from oil and petrol brought in by tankers and from coal-powered electricity transmitted to the island through a mainland cable link. Today that traffic in energy has been reversed. Samsingers now export millions of kilowatt hours of electricity from renewable energy sources to the rest of Denmark. In doing so, islanders have cut their carbon footprint by a staggering 140 per cent. And what Samso can do today, the rest of the world can achieve in the near future, it is claimed.</p> <p>Last year, carbon dioxide reached a record figure of 384 parts per million - a rise of around 35 per cent on levels that existed before the Industrial Revolution. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that such changes could soon have a dramatic impact on the world's weather patterns. Already, Arctic sea ice is dwindling alarmingly and scientists say the world has only a few years left to make serious carbon-output cuts before irreversible, devastating climate change ensues. Samso suggests one route for avoiding such a fate.</p> <p>Everywhere you travel on the island you see signs of change. There are dozens of wind turbines of various sizes dotted across the landscape, houses have solar-panelled roofs, while a long line of giant turbines off the island's southern tip swirl in the wind. Towns are linked to district heating systems that pump hot water to homes. These are either powered by rows of solar panels covering entire fields, or by generators which burn straw from local farms, or timber chips cut from the island's woods.</p> <p>None of these enterprises has been imposed by outsiders or been funded by major energy companies. Each plant is owned either by a collective of local people or by an individual islander. The Samso revolution has been an exercise in self-determination - a process in which islanders have decided to demonstrate what can be done to alleviate climate damage while still maintaining a comfortable lifestyle. </p> <p>Consider Jorgen. As he wanders round his cowsheds, he scarcely looks like an energy entrepreneur. Yet the 47-year-old farmer is a true power broker. Apart from his fields of pumpkins and potatoes, as well as his 150 cows, he has erected a giant 1 megawatt (mw) wind turbine that looms down on his 120-hectare dairy farm. Four other great machines stand beside it, swirling in Samso's relentless winds. Each device is owned either by a neighbouring farmer or by a collective of locals. In addition, Jorgen has bought a half share in an even bigger, 2.3mw generator, one of the 10 devices that guard the south coast of Samso and now help to supply a sizeable chunk of Denmark's electricity.</p> <p>The people of Samso were once the producers of more than 45,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide every year - about 11 tonnes a head. Through projects like these, they have cut that figure to -15,000. (That strange minus figure comes from the fact that Samsingers export their excess wind power to mainland Denmark, where it replaces electricity that would otherwise be generated using coal or gas.) It is a remarkable transformation, wrought mainly by Samsingers themselves, albeit with the aid of some national and European Union funds and some generous, guaranteed fixed prices that Denmark provides for wind-derived electricity. The latter ensures turbines pay for themselves over a six- or seven-year period. After that, owners can expect to rake in some tidy profits.</p> <p>'It has been a very good investment,' admits Jorgen. 'It has made my bank manager very happy. But none of us is in it just for the money. We are doing it because it is fun and it makes us feel good.' Nor do his efforts stop with his turbines. Jorgen recently redesigned his cowshed so it requires little straw for bedding for his cattle. Each animal now has its own natty mattress. Instead, most of the straw from Jorgen's fields is sold to his local district heating plant, further increasing his revenue and limiting carbon dioxide production. (Carbon dioxide is absorbed as crops grow in fields. When their stalks - straw - are burned, that carbon dioxide is released, but only as a gas that has been recycled within a single growing season. By contrast, oil, coal and gas are the remains of plants that are millions of years old and so, when burned, release carbon dioxide that had been sequestered aeons ago.)</p> <p>Samso's transformation owes its origin to a 1997 experiment by the Danish government. Four islands, Laeso, Samso, Aero and Mon, as well as the region of Thyholm in Jutland, were each asked to compete in putting up the most convincing plan to cut their carbon outputs and boost their renewable-energy generation. Samso won. </p> <p>Although it lies at the heart of Denmark, the nation's fractured geography also ensures the island is one of its most awkward places to reach, surrounded as it is by the Kattegat, an inlet of the North Sea. To get to Samso from Copenhagen, you have to travel by train for a couple of hours to Kalundborg and then take one of the twice daily ferries to Samso. A total of 4,100 people live here, working on farms or in hotels and restaurants. The place is isolated and compact and ideal for an experiment in community politics and energy engineering - particularly as it is low-lying and windswept. Flags never droop on Samso.</p> <p>The job of setting up the Samso experiment fell to Soren Harmensen, a former environmental studies teacher, with thinning greyish hair and an infectious enthusiasm for all things renewable. Outside his project's headquarters, at the Samso Energiakademi - a stylish, barn-like building designed to cut energy consumption to an absolute minimum - there is an old, rusting petrol pump parked on the front steps. A label on it says, simply: 'No fuel. So what now, my love?' Step inside and you will find no shortage of answers to that question. </p> <p>Soren is a proselytiser and proud of his island's success. However, achieving it was not an easy matter. It took endless meetings to get things started. Every time there was a community issue at stake, he would arrive and preach his sermon about renewable energy and its value to the island. Slowly, the idea took hold and eventually public meetings were held purely to discuss his energy schemes. Even then, the process was erratic, with individual islanders' self-interest triggering conflicts. One Samsinger, the owner of a cement factory, proposed a nuclear plant be built on the island instead of wind turbines. He would then secure the concrete contract for the reactor, he reasoned. The plan was quietly vetoed.</p> <p>'We are not hippies,' says Soren. 'We just want to change how we use our energy without harming the planet or without giving up the good life.'</p> <p>Eventually the first projects were launched, a couple of turbines on the west coast, and a district heating plant. 'Nothing was achieved without talk and a great deal of community involvement,' says Soren, a message he has since carried round the planet. 'I visited Shropshire recently,' he says. 'A wind-farm project there was causing a huge fuss, in particular among the three villages nearest the proposed site. The planners would soothe the objections of one village, only for the other two to get angry - so local officials would turn to them. Then the first village started to object all over again. The solution was simple, of course. Give each village a turbine, I told them. The prospect of cheap electricity would have changed everyone's minds.' Needless to say, this did not happen.</p> <p>On another visit - this time to Islay, off the west coast of Scotland - Soren found similar problems. 'I was asked to attend a public meeting to debate the idea of turning the island into a renewable energy centre like Samso. But nearly all the speakers droned on about ideals and about climate change in general. But what people really want is to be involved themselves and to do something that can make a difference to the world. That point was entirely lost.</p> <p>'Later I found that a local Islay distillery was installing a new set of boilers. Why not use the excess water to heat local homes, I suggested. That would be far too much bother, I was told. Yet that was just the kind of scheme that could kick-start a renewable-energy revolution.'</p> <p>Of course, there is something irritating about this Scandinavian certainty. Not every community is as cohesive as Samso's, for one thing. And it should also be noted that the island's transformation has come at a price: roughly 420m kroner - about \u00a340m - that includes money from the Danish government, the EU, local businessmen and individual members of collectives. Thus the Samso revolution cost around \u00a310,000 per islander, although a good chunk has come from each person's own pockets. Nevertheless, if you multiply that sum by 60m - the population of Great Britain - you get a figure of around \u00a3600bn as the cost of bringing a similar revolution to Britain. It is utterly impractical, of course - a point happily acknowledged by Soren.</p> <p>'This is a pilot project to show the world what can be done. We are not suggesting everyone makes the sweeping changes that we have. People should cherry pick from what we have done in order to make modest, but still meaningful carbon emission cuts. The crucial point is that we have shown that if you want to change how we generate energy, you have to start at the community level and not impose technology on people. For example, Shell heard about what we were doing and asked to be involved - but only on condition they ended up owning the turbines. We told them to go away. We are a nation of farmers, of course. We believe in self-sufficiency.'</p> <p>Jesper Kjems was a freelance journalist based in Copenhagen when he and his wife came to Samso for a holiday four years ago. They fell in love with the island and moved in a few months later, although neither had jobs. Jesper started playing in a local band and met Soren Harmensen, its bassist, who sold him the Samso energy dream. Today Jesper is official spokesman for the Samso project. </p> <p>Outside the town of Nordby, he showed me round its district heating project. A field has been covered with solar panels mounted to face the sun. Cold water is pumped in at one end to emerge, even on a gloomy day, as seriously hot water - around 70C - which is then piped to local houses for heating and washing. On particularly dark, sunless days, the plant switches mode: wood chips are scooped by robot crane into a furnace which heats the plant's water instead. The entire system is completely automated. 'There are some living creatures involved, however,' adds Jesper. 'A flock of sheep is sent into the field every few days to nibble the grass before it grows long enough to prevent the sun's rays hitting the panels.'</p> <p>Everywhere you go, you find renewable- energy enthusiasts like Jesper. Crucially, most of them are recent recruits to the cause. Nor do planning rows concerning the sight of 'eyesore' wind turbines affect Samsingers as they do Britons. 'No one minds wind turbines on Samso for the simple reason that we all own a share of one,' says electrician Brian Kjar.</p> <p>And that is the real lesson from Samso. What has happened here is a social not a technological revolution. Indeed, it was a specific requirement of the scheme, when established, that only existing, off-the-shelf renewable technology be used. The real changes have been those in attitude. Brian's house near the southern town of Orby reveals the consequences. He has his own wind turbine, which he bought second-hand for \u00a316,000 - about a fifth of its original price. This produces more electricity than his household needs, so he uses the excess to heat water that he keeps in a huge insulated tank that he also built himself. On Samso's occasional windless days, this provides heating for his home when the 70ft turbine outside his house is not moving. </p> <p>'Everyone knows someone who is interested in renewable energy today,' he adds. 'Something like this starts with a few people. It just needs time to spread. That is the real lesson of Samso.'</p>",
  "<p>It was the last weekend of summer - the Democratic convention looming; a late heatwave baffling the chills of fall - when I drove upstate from New York City to meet Philip Roth at home in northwest Connecticut. It's like Switzerland round here - sparkling streams; plush, manicured properties; perfect meadows - with countless American flags advertising an air of patriotic entitlement. Roth's remote grey clapboard house, dating to the revolution, is high on a hill down a quiet country road, not hard to find, but some miles from the nearest village, which is really a nothing place with two antique stores.</p> <p>The tall figure who emerges from among the apple trees in greeting wears grey tracksuit bottoms and a long-sleeved grey sweatshirt that makes me think of prison garb in some progressive correctional regime. Before I find the composure to take in the burning intensity of his expression, the smooth grey features and interrogative tilt of the head, reminiscent of an American eagle, my first impression is that Philip Roth looks as much like a Supreme Court judge on furlough as one of his country's most admired writers.</p> <p>In his own words, from the opening of The Ghost Writer, you could 'begin to understand why hiding out twelve hundred feet up in the mountains with just the birds and the trees might not be a bad idea for a writer, Jewish or not... Purity. Serenity. Simplicity. Seclusion. All one's concentration and flamboyance and originality reserved for the gruelling, exalted, transcendent calling.' Like his hero Zuckerman, Roth seems to have thought, 'This is how I will live.'</p> <p>We walk slowly across the cool, nicely rambling grass to a kind of gauzy yurt, a converted fruit cage with garden chairs in which Roth and his guests can enjoy bug-free conversation. Stepping into this bubble feels like entering the outdoor jurisdiction of the writer's mind.</p> <p>'Let's work,' says Roth, stretching back on his sun-baked recliner to signal the start of the interview. It sounds informal, but the truth is that all conversations with the author of Portnoy's Complaint are highly controlled: your questions submitted in advance; the transcript scrutinised afterwards; the watchful eye of agents and publicists along the way. Make no mistake: we are being admitted into a well-defended environment.</p> <p>In the American literary undergrowth, Philip Roth is a big beast as fabulous as the hippogriff, rarely sighted, spoken of with awe, and the subject of wild, sometimes scandalised, gossip. Ever since Portnoy, he has endured the kind of attention that might drive you to crave solitude, or into paranoia: incessant self-abuse jokes, a persistent drizzle of hostility and the envious scrutiny of lesser writers. Now, more than 50 years after he began to write, the author of The Counterlife and American Pastoral might agree with Peter De Vries, who observed of American literary life that 'one dreams of the goddess Fame - and winds up with the bitch Publicity'.</p> <p>This house in Connecticut represents the private, contemplative Roth. His apartment in New York sponsors something more public. There, as his literary biographer Hermione Lee has written, 'going out with Philip Roth in Manhattan is like going out with Louis XIV in Versailles: the king is in his kingdom'. The writer himself says that his appetite for exposure lies somewhere between the reclusiveness of JD Salinger and the self-advertising of the late Norman Mailer. </p> <p>Flitting between the private and the public, Roth today is as much of a literary celebrity as either of these near contemporaries. He owes this to Portnoy of course, and also to his lifetime's writing: Roth has never taken his eyes off the prize, or neglected the artistic duty of work. Compared with his peers, and compared with virtually any American writer of stature, Roth's output, for a man in his seventies and with some 29 books behind him, is astonishing. Never a day passes when he does not stare at those three hateful words: qwertyuiop, asdfghjkl, and zxcvbnm. 'I'm over in my studio most of the day,' he says. 'I return to the house every night, like a workman coming back from the fiction factory: \"I'm home, honey.\"'</p> <p>Except that now there's no honey at home. Divorced from his second wife, Claire Bloom, in 1993, Roth lives totally alone out here, cooking his own meals and keeping to himself. 'I've fallen out of any kind of social world,' he says. </p> <p>'I don't really know anybody up here any longer.' </p> <p>Once, he lived here year round, but in old age he finds the winters too brutal. He has 'a place in New York' and says that when he's there 'I see people; usually I have dinner with somebody in the evening.' But, either in the country or the city, he sticks to the schedule he's always worked, morning, noon and night, 365 days a year. 'I am,' he once said, 'very much like somebody who spends all day writing.'</p> <p>Now he's more isolated than ever. 'All my friends around here have died,' he says, running through the honour roll. 'Richard Widmark? Dick died about two months ago. Arthur Miller, he died; he lived half an hour away. And Bill Styron. And I had a very good pal, a doctor in the next town over who I was very close to. So I'm four for four,' he says, sadly slipping into baseball jargon. Death, observed WH Auden, is like the rumble of distant thunder at a picnic. Roth's roll-call tells him that the picnic is drawing to a close, that death is out there, waiting. 'It seems to creep into one book after another,' he remarks. </p> <p>'I don't think anybody's gotten out alive in my last five books.' </p> <p>With Roth, art and life are strangely braided. 'I made a list of people who've died in the past few years. It's staggering. The funerals and the eulogies keep it all in mind.' Does he speak at these funerals? 'I speak at some. It's not a genre I've mastered, the eulogy. I find it very difficult.'</p> <p>Similarly, Roth can't quite believe his age. 'I'm 75, a strange number,' he volunteers. 'It's a strange discovery, for me at any rate. In your early years you don't go to funerals every six months.' Among his peers, there has been a steady winnowing: Arthur Miller, George Plimpton, Kurt Vonnegut, and most recently, Norman Mailer. These were not all close friends, but he knows he's playing in injury time. </p> <p>Roth's place in American letters is not just a matter of seniority, or productivity. The sequence of novels, well-wrought explorations of his country's recent past, that began in 1997 when Roth was in his mid-sixties - an age when many writers would have been content to rest on their laurels - amounts to an extraordinary portrait that has been saluted by critics on both sides of the Atlantic: American Pastoral, an elegy for American family life set in the Vietnam era; his blistering portrait of Eve Frame in I Married A Communist (1998); The Human Stain (2000); The Dying Animal (2001); The Plot Against America (2004); Everyman (2006) and finally, his farewell to Zuckerman, Exit Ghost (2007). This list is testament to as remarkable a late-season career surge as any in living memory and leaves all his competitors standing in his dust. </p> <p>And it's not over yet. His latest, Indignation, was published last week. He knows it's short, and possibly slight. A volume of some 230 pages, Indignation narrates the morphine-induced recollections of the young Marcus Messner, a fatally wounded conscript in the Korean war. Messner will die in the closing pages of the novel, and it is ambiguous how much his memories are actually posthumous or feverishly imagined on the point of death.</p> <p>Humorously, Roth says it stands somewhere between a novella and, 'a worse word', a novelette. 'The publisher called it a novel. They tell me \"novel\" is a better word to use.' In repose, Roth's expression can be severe, even intimidating. When he smiles, everything lights up, and for a moment the world becomes an easier place to be. </p> <p>People who are close to him, friends I spoke to in London and New York, always say that, in the right mood, he can be one of the funniest men alive. But today he is working, explaining how he made his latest book from the discarded pages of another story, and the occasional laugh lines in this conversation do not translate into print.</p> <p>In American literature, the 'posthumous novel' is a rare device, exploited most recently in Alice Sebold's bestseller The Lovely Bones. Momentarily professorial, Roth is quick to acknowledge that it's not original, pointing out that Epitaph for a Small Winner, by the 19th-century Brazilian writer Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, employs the same narrative point of view. The truth is that it's not wholly successful, though the prose seems undiminished; but Roth is untroubled. 'In the morphine sleep he doesn't know where he is, so he imagines he's dead... If it's ambiguous, that's OK, too.'</p> <p>Anyway, Roth's real concern in Indignation is to explore the world of a Jewish boy, born and raised in Newark in the Thirties and Forties, a young man who flees his over-protective parents to enrol in a liberal arts college away from home and come of age in the America of the Fifties, a young man curiously similar, in outward appearance, to Roth himself.</p> <p>At this point veteran Roth readers will exclaim with a sigh, Here we go again. But what did they expect? The point about Roth is that he is the most interesting person he knows, and quite unabashed about his extraordinary singularity. </p> <p>Describing his own chapel attendances at Bucknell College in rural Pennsylvania, which mirror those of Marcus Messner, he says he felt 'like a Houyhnhnm who had strayed on to the campus from Gulliver's Travels'.</p> <p>That is the writer's authentic voice. Roth, as Martin Amis says, 'is somehow inordinately unique. He is himself, himself, himself.' To another of his many interviewers he declared, simply: 'I'm the emergency.' Sitting here in the afternoon sunshine, he instinctively frames himself as a character, almost in the third person. 'I'm like an old man,' he says, as if not quite willing to concede that he might actually be old. Friends confirm that there is no one more competitive with himself than Roth. Similarly, if there is one person who has celebrated Philip Roth and his legend it must be Roth himself. What interests him, he writes in Deception, 'is the terrible ambiguity of the \"I\", the way a writer makes a myth of himself and, particularly, why'. One place to start might be his origins.</p> <p>Philip Roth was born into a family of second-generation Jews, 'before pantyhose and frozen food,' he says, in the year of Hitler's rise to power, 1933. His parents were intensely, even maddeningly, devoted to their son. 'To be at all,' he writes of his mother and father in his autobiography, The Facts, 'is to be her Philip, but in the embroilment of the buffeting world, my history still takes its spin from beginning as his Roth.'</p> <p>Roth's sensibilities will always be marked by the themes and tempo of the 'low, dishonest decade' into which he was born, but just as influential was his milieu: a lower middle-class Jewish community in Newark, New Jersey, across the river from Manhattan, a suburban city that occupies the kind of relation to the metropolis that, say, Croydon does to London. </p> <p>He was, and is, a passionate American, a baseball fanatic who at one point cheerfully refers to himself as 'a Yank'. After himself, the great, wounded republic is his subject. Years ago, in The Facts, he wrote: 'It's hard to imagine that anyone of intelligence growing up in America since the Vietnam War can have had our unambiguous sense, as young adolescents immediately after the victory over Nazi fascism and Japanese militarism, of belonging to the greatest nation on earth.' Today, looking back at the Fifties from a post-Bush perspective, he disputes this, saying, 'There never was a golden age.' It is, nonetheless, a moment in American history that dominates the brief narrative of Indignation</p> <p>The Newark of Roth's childhood was 'still largely white', but already in decline, which is perhaps why he remains so attached to it. Today, the city is almost wholly black, with a black mayor and the civic afflictions of drug-related criminality. 'My old neighbourhood is bad, but the whole city is bad. Downtown, there's lots of people selling stuff on the street, mostly stolen goods. I wouldn't wander around the streets by myself. So it's pretty bad, and very depressing, too.' </p> <p>Newark and Newarkness shaped Roth's life profoundly, and continue to do so, as though he has never left. He and his fellow Newark-ite Paul Auster like to speculate about making a literary pilgrimage to their roots. He says, half in jest: 'We'd have to take a cop with us. It's very dangerous.' Indignation, indeed, opens in Newark and celebrates its ethnic vitality with a thunderous crescendo: 'hard-working, coarse-grained, bribe-ridden, semi-xenophobic Irish-Italian-German-Slavic-Jewish-Negro Newark'.</p> <p>Many of the great American writers are creatures of their neighbourhood. Bellow has Chicago, Fitzgerald jazz-age Manhattan, and Faulkner Yoknapatawpha County. Updike cleaves to Massachusetts, and for Roth it's Newark. So much so that the city has named a plaza for him. He's proud of this, in an ironical way. 'You'll score better drugs on Roth Plaza than Malamud Plaza,' he jokes, adding that 'the then mayor has now been indicted, tried, and convicted on various illegalities.'</p> <p>In old age, he recoils from urban extremism, but as a young man he relished it. Roth has said his adolescent experience was 'about our aggression, our going out into Newark, three or four of us, wandering the streets at night, shooting crap in back of the high school with flashlights, girls, going after your date to this gathering place called Syd's on Chancellor Avenue and telling your sex stories... Appetite. Maybe that's the word. It was the appetites that were aggressive.' </p> <p>In this highly verbal, frustrated and competitive hothouse the young Roth incubated the wild, comic voice that would explode into American consciousness with Portnoy's notorious 'complaint'. The Jewishness of old Newark shaped Roth in another way, too. Through all the subsequent phases of his literary life, there is a consistent character thread, which many readers have found intensely, almost viscerally, appealing. Perhaps it was this psychic inheritance that inspired Roth to boast about 'my good fortune in being born a Jew'. As much as he is infuriated by the predicament in which it has landed him, he enjoys the originality. 'It's a complicated, interesting, morally demanding and very singular experience,' he says, 'and I like that.' </p> <p>The classic Roth protagonist, who surfaces once again in Indignation, is painfully intelligent, self-aware and over-protected. An instinctive aesthete, he is divided between mind and body, sex and reason, family and self, desire and duty. A martyr to neurasthenia, this troubled figure is tormented by impossible (even mad) women, overweening parents and, worst of all, a bad conscience. Over the years, Roth has had a hard time from some feminists, and now strongly resists the suggestion that there is - shall we say? - a strain of craziness in many of his fictional women.</p> <p>'Well, let's see,' he replies equably, as if enunciating a quasi-biblical exegesis. 'In Exit Ghost there isn't, I don't think. There are two sane women there. And in Everyman the women are all sane. There's a crazy one in When She Was Good (1967) and another in My Life As a Man (1974). I think proportional to the population I have the right number of crazy women.' So, there you are, QED.</p> <p>Roth's novels brilliantly anatomise the manic carousel of passionate feelings. Mixed with the volatile chemistry of his own temperament, his Jewishness and an indefinable lower middle-class awkwardness vis \u00e0 vis that great unmentionable, American class, seem to have inspired plenty of rage, to use a less genteel synonym for 'indignation'. 'Rage', 'revenge', 'acrimony' - these words pop up all over the landscape of Roth's work. Now, perhaps, in his mid-seventies, there's a softening. The 'indignation' of his new book may be 'the most beautiful word in the English language', but it comes from the Chinese national anthem, the one we all heard during the Beijing Olympics.</p> <p>Like Marcus Messner, the young Roth was taught in grade school by left-leaning teachers who, in addition to patriotic songs such as 'Anchors Away', at weekly assembly, encouraged their kids to learn clunky Chinese propaganda:</p> <p>Arise, ye who refuse to be bondslaves!</p> <p>Indignation fills the hearts of all our countrymen,</p> <p>Arise! Arise! Arise!</p> <p>In one of the more surreal scenes from America's wartime mobilisation, Roth says that in Newark you had 'all these little Jewish kids belting out the Chinese national anthem! The only Chinese we knew was the laundryman.'</p> <p>We agree, now, that this is a lost world, almost as remote as the stagecoach or the silver dollar. Who, meeting the grade A student Philip Milton Roth in 1953 (the year in which he locates the end of Indignation) could have foreseen his literary life? The Roth of myth was yet to come, and all but invisible. </p> <p>In the Fifties, indeed, young Roth followed a career path that might have fashioned him into the kind of literature professor you might find in one of his novels - sombre, mildly lecherous, immersed in literature. 'I thought I was going to be an English professor, but six months into my PhD I couldn't stand it. So I dropped out, and began to write. I got $800 from Esquire for a story.'</p> <p>Looking back on those times, he confesses to a pessimism now about the future of what he calls 'aesthetic literacy'. There was then, he says, 'a literary wedge in the culture'. He explains, 'There were probably 30 literary quarterlies in America at that time. The most famous were the Paris Review, the Kenyon Review and the Hudson Review - most of them are now out of business - but there were 15 or 20 more. So if you wrote a short story, you'd get a publisher. There was a truly literary culture, very small, but that culture's gone. There were people who read seriously, and their numbers were far greater than they are now. You can say, what's the difference if you have 50,000 or 20,000 readers?'</p> <p>In answer to the question, What is the difference? Roth tells the story of his friend, the Romanian writer Norman Manea. 'Under Ceausescu, Norman went to an older writer from the Party to complain about his readership. The man said, \"Norman, all a writer needs are eight readers. Think about it. Why do you need more than eight readers? That's enough. [Pause.] You, unfortunately, have only three,\"' Roth laughs. 'Well, we're down to three here, too.' More soberly, he rejects the contemporary evidence of literary striving as a sham, and has no patience with Creative Writing, which he thinks is a waste of time. 'American college students don't take expository writing, which they desperately need, but they take Creative Writing, which is like taking doodling.'</p> <p>Roth was never a doodler. There was always a moral seriousness to his work. But then he discovered the cost of exploring his Jewishness, and perhaps this is one source of the rage that permeates his work. In April 1959, another early story, 'Defender of the Faith', published in the New Yorker, so offended some Jewish readers with its suggestion that a Jewish soldier might exploit the Jewish sensitivities of his Jewish commanding officer to secure preferential treatment that the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith stepped in.</p> <p>Suddenly 'Philip Roth' was the subject of synagogue gossip and household arguments. His offence, which now seems impossibly arcane, was compounded the following year by the inclusion of the story in his debut volume, Goodbye Columbus. For much of the Sixties he was declared a traitor to his people, abused and denounced up and down as worse than anti-Semitic. 'I defended myself,' he recalls, 'but I was thrown by it, a big assault at 26. I could handle it, but I didn't like it.' </p> <p>Of course, this tribal brouhaha was nothing compared with the scandal of Portnoy's Complaint, which came out at the end of the Sixties. Portnoy's Complaint, which made him a celebrity, is an iconic book that changed everything, pitching him headlong into a world of banal public curiosity.</p> <p>Roth has often said he cannot identify any single experience from which Portnoy's Complaint originated. In early drafts it was 'The Jewboy'; then a play (workshopped by Dustin Hoffman); then 'Whacking Off'; then a short story, 'A Jewish Patient Begins His Analysis', and finally, with the appearance of his psychoanalyst, Portnoy's Complaint</p> <p>This 'wild blue shocker' (Life), a novel in the guise of a confession, was an immediate bestseller. Taken by hundreds of thousands of American readers as a confession in the guise of a novel, it placed its author inexorably centre stage in the minds of his audience. He's been there ever since.</p> <p>To my suggestion that he might have unconsciously courted outrage with Portnoy's Complaint, after his experience of the Jewish-American persecution complex, he replies carefully, 'I don't have any sense of audience, and least of all when I'm writing. The audience I'm writing for is me, and I'm so busy trying to figure the damn thing out, and having so much trouble, that the last thing I think of is: \"What is X, Y or Z going to be thinking of it?\"' Whatever the motivation, there was no going back. 'Literature got me into this,' says his character Peter Tarnopol in The Great American Novel, 'and literature is gonna have to get me out.'</p> <p>Perhaps writing literary fiction was hardly an ideal escape route, but it was what he knew. Roth's work in the early Seventies seemed to exhibit what one critic dubbed 'the perils of an over-literary mind'. After the wild comedy of Portnoy's Complaint, Roth experimented with satire (Our Gang), satirical fantasy (The Breast), the chaotic fantasies of The Great American Novel, and the 'miraculous mess' of My Life as a Man. Finally, he settled, in young middle age, into his exploration of the self, through Tarnopol, through Kepesh (The Professor of Desire) and eventually Zuckerman (The Ghost Writer and Zuckerman Unbound). This was the middle period of Roth's career, and it coincided with his relationship with Claire Bloom, who decided early on that she wanted 'to spend my life with this remarkable man'.</p> <p>When the British actress first met Roth in 1975, she says she found him 'daunting and flattering', but within a year they were lovers, and soon Bloom was visiting him here in Connecticut, becoming a kind of muse. The Professor of Desire (1977) is dedicated to her, and this mid-season ferment also yielded, among others, The Ghost Writer (1979), Zuckerman Unbound (1981) and The Counterlife (1986), one of his very finest and most original novels.</p> <p>By then, the Roth-Bloom liaison was so well-established on both sides of the Atlantic that he was spending half the year in London and had found a studio in Notting Hill. Despite an inevitable struggle with what he felt to be English anti-Semitism, he says he liked living in England. 'I met lots of people and made many friends, more friends than I had in New York, strangely; and I liked going back and forth.'</p> <p>The intimacy of Roth's connection to England is captured in Deception, a novel narrated entirely in dialogue, which imagines a literary man's affair with, among others, a middle-class English woman. The raw immediacy of this fiction, with its Rothian declaration that 'In my imagination I am unfaithful to everybody', provoked a crisis with Bloom, who writes in her memoir of this episode that, 'I no longer gave a damn whether these girlfriends were erotic fantasies. What left me speechless - though not for long - was that he would paint a picture of me as a jealous wife who is betrayed over and over again. I found the portrait nasty and insulting.'</p> <p>Almost simultaneously with this rift, Roth suffered a freak breakdown (induced by the Halcion prescribed after knee surgery) together with a new, and urgent, longing to come home. 'I began to feel less and less connected to America. I began to feel I was losing touch with American life. And so by 1989 I realised I couldn't do this any more. So I came back. It was a wonderful return home, because I rediscovered an old subject, which was this country, and I began to write those books about America. It was the best situation. I found a new subject which was an old subject that I knew. All the old stuff was fresh for me.' </p> <p>In 1993, there was a second renewal. He got divorced from Claire Bloom and entered the phase that has culminated in Exit Ghost and Indignation. 'Freedom, it's called,' he says, freighting the sentence with an almost tangible exhilaration. Now he was in the clear. He could come and go as he pleased. He could work where, how and whenever he chose, read as he pleased, and revel in the exploration of his many selves. So does he, I wondered, read his contemporaries?</p> <p>'No, I don't, and it's not out of principle. I don't read very much fiction any longer. If I'm going to read something I much prefer to read non-fiction. And I do; I read every night. I re-read. That's what I've been doing. Last month I was re-reading Camus. I haven't read The Plague in 40 years.' Recently he's also re-read Turgenev and Conrad. </p> <p>Which brings us to the re-reading of Roth himself. Portnoy's Complaint is still a recklessly funny tour de force, but a young man's book and a great comedy of its time. From his middle age, many novels of Roth's literary self-obsession do not weather well. They seem contrived, and rather lacking in humanity. At this point in the game, perhaps the best you can say is that he still harbours an ambition for simple greatness that has, thus far, seemed to slip through his fingers. </p> <p>Roth's prose, famously, displays the artifice of no artifice. On the page, he achieves a voice that's plain, natural and close to the everyday rhythms of speech. At its finest it is breathtaking, lean, sleek and muscular, a downhill racer, with a mesmerising momentum and demotic zest. Throughout his writing, he exhibits a deep admiration for two English writers, Shakespeare and George Orwell. It was Orwell who celebrated 'good prose' being 'like a window pane', and I think Roth's clarity derives in part from Orwell, whose great books, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four, were published in the Forties, at an impressionable stage of Roth's adolescence.</p> <p>But when you try to approach this tetchy, isolated man through his books, the difficulties pile up. The lives in the novels, weighed down with 'the terrible ambiguity of the \"I\"', lack the simplicity of the prose. Rather, they hover in a no-man's-land between imagination and reality. This is because the author himself is elusive, indifferent and defensive towards vulgar efforts to locate him. Like many comic writers, he seems troubled, and especially by the attentions of the outside world. He prefers his solitary confinement, and his library.</p> <p>Enter Roth's world and you step into a hall of mirrors. Roth has done himself in so many different voices that, facing the title page of Indignation, 'books by Philip Roth', some 29, are now catalogued as 'Zuckerman' (eight titles, including The Anatomy Lesson), 'Roth' (five, including Operation Shylock and Deception), 'Kepesh' (three, including The Dying Animal, recently filmed as Elegy, starring Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), as well as 'Other' (10, including Portnoy's Complaint and Goodbye, Columbus.</p> <p>His preferred critic, Hermione Lee, gives the best account of this: 'Lives into stories, stories into lives: that's the name of Roth's double game.' The playfulness, if that's what it is, does not end there. Roth's highly contrived 'novelist's autobiography' The Facts opens with a letter to Nathan Zuckerman, his most celebrated alter ego, asking for his verdict on the book, and it ends with Zuckerman's 'reply': 'Dear Roth, I've read the manuscript twice. Here is the candour you ask for: Don't publish.' In addition to many, carefully scripted, interviews there is the memorable moment of awesome solipsism in Reading Myself and Others (1976) when Roth actually interviews himself! What on earth is going on? Critics have been driving themselves into paroxysms over this for decades. Is it authorial playfulness? A giant tease? Postmodernism run mad? Neurasthenic insecurity? Or the desperate strategies of a writer with insufficient material?</p> <p>Roth himself hates to be asked about his many alter egos. He speaks contemptuously of critics who get snared in the barbed wire of the Rothian no-man's-land, gunning them down with: 'Am I Roth or Zuckerman? It's all me... Nothing is me. I write fiction and I'm told it's autobiography; I write autobiography and I'm told it's fiction. So since I'm so dim and they're so smart, let them decide what it is or isn't.'</p> <p>Roth will always be defensive towards any attempt to link him to his protagonists. So when, rashly, I ask him if Marcus Messner is 'another of your alter egos?' he does not reply at once, and then responds coolly with, 'Ask me another way.' Finally, after a bit of sparring, he says, 'I'm not crazy about it [the alter ego]. It suggests a stand-in for me, when it's a character who grew out of the narration, and when none of those things happened to me. None of those things happened to me. It's imaginary.' As well as the continuing irritation about the alter ego question, however hard he tries to break new ground, there will always be disappointed readers harking back to 'the early work'.</p> <p>Christopher Hitchens, who has lived as a reader through every phase of Roth's writing and has also read Indignation, says he is enraged by the new book: 'There was a time when Roth was falsely accused of self-hatred by the elders of his own tribe (and defended from the charge by men of the calibre of Ralph Ellison). But to see him repeatedly fouling his own nest, and trying by vain repetitions like Exit Ghost to drag down the level of his previous work, and insulting us with Indignation is to wonder whether in some awful way he isn't trying to vindicate the original accusation, as well as to make his old age shame his youth.'</p> <p>What any critic says now will have little traction with Roth. He does not bother with reviews. 'I try to read as few as I can. It's not really very rewarding, except in a few instances, and it depends upon who's written it. If Frank Kermode reviewed my book I would read the review.'</p> <p>Novella, or novelette, or long short story, some of the material in Indignation is recycled from previous books. But if there is here an intimation of waning powers, there is also a new focus: a self that recognises the approach of the end, and another that looks back to the beginning. As well as reflecting on mortality, Indignation is about a young man's coming-of-age. </p> <p>'Coming and going, yes,' Roth replies, alluding to the death of his protagonist. 'I was trying to get away from writing about old men [Exit Ghost, Everyman, The Dying Animal]. I wanted to say I just don't want to think about that stuff any more. I have nothing fresh to say about it.' </p> <p>Was he, I wondered, not tempted to write a comedy to dispel the chill shadows of mortality? 'I would love to, but... [a beat] ...I don't think I know how to be comic any more.'</p> <p>Indignation argues against this. There's a comic set-piece at the heart of the narrative in which Marcus Messner gets a blow-job from his girlfriend. Roth acknowledges this, but seriously. 'What I wanted to do in this book is, through a little incident in this small place, depict sexual mores that have disappeared.'</p> <p>As our conversation turns to the, strictly speaking, fabulous experience of fellatio in the Fifties, we slide back to the world of Roth's youth, and he's talking about the books he read as an aspiring writer, 'sports books and adventure stories', Mark Twain, Theodore Dreiser and John Dos Passos. 'Every budding literary kid fell on Thomas Wolfe [Look Homeward, Angel] with a passion. There was this stream of rhetoric.' He begins to quote, happily. '\"O lost, and by the wind-grieved ghost, come back again...!\" Whatever that means.' A smile. 'Sounds good, though. As a kid, I wrote in the margin, \"Yes!\"'</p> <p>These half-remembered writers from the Twenties and Thirties haunt the Roth of Indignation. Even the name of his fictional midwestern town is taken directly from a collection of stories, Winesburg, Ohio, by Sherwood Anderson, a writer whose subject, like Roth's, is 'repression'. Roth's unconscious, inner dialogue with the American writers of the past is perhaps more revealing than he will allow. </p> <p>Curious, I turned up the opening pages of Anderson's 'book of grotesques', and found this passage, which stands almost as an epigraph to our conversation: 'Perfectly still he lay and his body was old and not of much use any more, but still something inside him was altogether young... It is absurd, you see, to try to tell what was inside the old writer as he lay on his high bed and listened to the fluttering of his heart. The thing to get at is what the writer, or the young thing within the writer, was thinking about.'</p> <p>When Roth published The Dying Animal in 2001, I asked him about his next book, and he replied, 'I hope it takes the rest of my life. I can't take starting from scratch.' But the experience of real life contradicts the writer's imaginative expectations. He's just finished another book - 'it's probably a novelette' - about another kind of death, a suicide. He insists this has 'no therapeutic value. I just find it's an interesting subject. I wanted to see if I could drive a character to that point where -' He stops. 'I'm trying to drive somebody crazy,' he summarises, with his usual deadpan delivery. </p> <p>So now he's looking for a new subject, and is once again in that dreadful limbo between books. 'Starting a new book is hell. You just flail around until something happens. It's miraculous. It comes to you out of nothing and nowhere. That's the problem with writing short books. You finish them too quickly. And that's what's wonderful about a long book. So I've decided I've got to find a big project that will take me right through to the end. Finish the day before, and - exit ghost.' </p> <p>The end of the tape comes with a 'click'. Our time is up. 'Would you like the tour?' he asks, slipping into a belated hostly ritual. When Roth stretches on his recliner, you see how painfully thin his legs have grown. We step out of the bug-free tent and stroll beneath a canopy of ancient oaks towards Roth's writing room, a well-appointed wooden summer house at the top of the garden. </p> <p>Inside, it's spartan but well-equipped, with the warm, comforting smell of wood. There are two desks - one for writing, one for 'business', a Roberts radio and a lectern where Roth, who has a bad back, likes to work standing up. On the mantelpiece over the empty fireplace ('I used to light a fire, but then I discovered I was spending all my time looking after it') there's a touching display of faded family photographs going back to the turn of the century. We inspect the sepia generations of Roths: his grandparents, his parents, his elder brother, and his younger self. There's a notable absence of wives or girlfriends, and almost the only outsider appears to be Saul Bellow, a lovely photo of his friend in his prime.</p> <p>Does he, I wonder, regret not having children? 'Well, I don't seem to go around regretting it, no. I was busy doing other things, you know, and then the opportunity slipped away because of age and the age of the women I was with.'</p> <p>He still likes to exercise. Most days, while it's warm, he'll swim in his pool at the bottom of the garden. Now, when summer ends, he will go back to New York City, and the familiar routine of dinners with friends and girlfriends.</p> <p>When the tour is over, he signs a copy of Indignation and we say goodbye. As I turn the car in the short driveway I see an old grey man walking slowly through the trees back to his studio for the inevitable rendezvous with his desk, a writer happily alone with his many selves, all passion spent.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To read more of Robert McCrum's brilliant interviews with literary giants, including Norman Mailer, VS Naipaul and Gore Vidal, go to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertmccrum\">theguardian.com/profile/robertmccrum</a></p>",
  "<p>In a poignant piece of casting, the British film star Natascha McElhone is to play a pioneering British doctor, just months after the sudden death of her husband, the groundbreaking surgeon Martin Kelly. The actress is to star in a screen version of the remarkable life of James Miranda Barry, who in 1812, while disguised as a man, became the first woman to graduate as a British doctor. Barry became the first UK surgeon to perform a successful Caesarean section, saving both mother and baby.</p> <p>Filming on Heaven and Earth, directed by the Oscar-winning Marleen Gorris, is to start in England and South Africa in the new year, and McElhone's portrayal of the part will have great personal resonance because of the work of her late husband, who died this year at the age of 43. Kelly, who performed reconstructive plastic surgery in London hospitals, also helped to set up the international charity Facing The World and developed a revolutionary new balm, called Heal Gel, for treating scars and burns.</p> <p>'Barry defied every convention of her time,' McElhone said. 'She disguised herself as a man to attend medical school, then excelled in an entirely male world, achieving the highest position possible for a military surgeon. She was a fearless pioneer, pushing the frontiers of accepted medical practice to find new and effective ways of treating her patients, always putting her own safety and popularity at risk.' </p> <p>Barry's deception has been praised by feminists and surgeons. It was the inspiration for a biography and novel, as well as at least one play and a planned opera libretto, but Heaven and Earth is the first film to tackle her astonishing progress through medicine.</p> <p>Training as an army medical officer, she rose to the rank of inspector-general, the equivalent of a major-general. Her secret was only discovered on her deathbed when the charwoman who laid out the body is said to have exclaimed that it was the corpse of 'a perfect female', with stretch marks proving she had given birth. 'The devil, a general! It's a woman. And a woman that has had a child!' one historic document claims the servant called out.</p> <p>Friends believe that McElhone, who appears in the hit US television series Californication and is best known for her roles opposite George Clooney in the film Solaris and Robert De Niro in Ronin, had decided to play the part before her husband's death and planned to learn more about surgery from him.</p> <p>'It has all been given further impetus now,' said Neil Randhawa, a close friend of the family and a consultant anaesthetist who worked with Kelly. 'Martin was a real man of vision and of action. In the environment we worked in, which was full of alpha males, many of us just felt left in his wake. He raised the bar and that raised everybody's game. He just did amazing work and was a great, great man. You don't meet many.' </p> <p>The film, with a script by Malcolm Kohll, also tells a love story. James Purefoy, recently seen as Mark Antony in the TV series Rome, will play Lord Somerset, a diplomat who sacrifices his career to safeguard Barry's secret. The story opens in 1825 in the South African Cape, where Somerset is governor of the garrison colony facing a rebellion. The skill of the new surgeon, known as James Miranda Barry, soon attracts his attention, but the attraction between the two must be suppressed in an era when any hint of homosexual activity would have led to execution. Once Somerset discovers Barry's true identity, they embark on a dangerous affair. Barry's hidden gender remains protected, while the governor is eventually disgraced. The film, which also stars actors Sean Pertwee and Mark Strong, goes on to chart the dramatic resolution of this love story.</p> <p>Following research revealed in the New Scientist magazine, Barry is believed to have been born in Ireland as Margaret Ann Bulkley, the daughter of a Cork grocer and Mary Ann Barry, the sister of James Barry, a professor of painting at the Royal Academy in London. She is thought to have taken her uncle's name to help her win a place at medical school, which was then barred to women. After studying at Edinburgh, she was apprenticed to a surgeon at St Thomas's Hospital in London before joining the army as a junior medical officer. Posted to South Africa as an assistant surgeon, it is believed Barry took an extended break on Mauritius to give birth to a child. Postings to the West Indies, Malta and Corfu followed and Barry earned a reputation as a moderniser, prioritising cleanliness in the operating theatre before its importance was fully understood.</p> <p>A small group of close friends may have been aware of Barry's gender, but most were fooled. During a serious illness at the age of 46 she gave orders that, if she should die, her body be rolled in sheets and not examined. In fact, the cross-dressing doctor lived on to the age of 70, eventually dying in London.</p> <p>One of the film's producers, Focus Film's David Pupkewitz, said: 'This is both an extraordinary story and an extraordinary project. It is great to bring together this actress with this story and this director, Marleen Gorris, the first woman to win an Academy Award for directing, with Antonia's Line.'</p>",
  "<p>At the heart of London's Docklands, once a mouldering reminder of Britain's history as a great trading nation and now a gleaming glass and steel symbol of the might of global finance, the Canary Wharf offices of American investment bank Lehman Brothers - a name few people would have been aware of until a week ago - has suddenly become a stop on the tourist trail. A group of business people over from China on a training course have stopped to stare and have their photographs taken.</p> <p>'It is very shocking. We are here and it is very dramatic,' says a young woman among them, but she is interrupted by a Lehman security guard who charges over. 'You can't take photographs here, bloody gawpers!' he says. The group race off immediately, heads down, and the guard turns back muttering about their lack of respect for other people's misery.</p> <p>In New York, too, the 'gawpers' thronged to Lehman's headquarters in their hundreds to watch history unfold. On both sides of the Atlantic throughout the past tumultuous week, from Lehman's catastrophic collapse on Sunday night to US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's promise on Friday to spend 'hundreds of billions of dollars' of American taxpayers' money to ride to the rescue of the banks, there was a profound sense of world-changing events unfolding at breakneck speed.</p> <p>Exuberant investors may have piled back into the stock markets on Friday, welcoming Paulson's mooted corporate aid package, but few believed anything would ever be the same again. Behind the anguished yells of disorientated City traders watching the markets oscillate from depression to mania and back again, and the macho insistence by Gordon Brown that he was in control of the crisis, something else was audible throughout - the sound of long-cherished truths being smashed to smithereens.</p> <p>Financiers in New York and London's Square Mile have enjoyed an extraordinary decade of global dominance, blowing unthinkable sums on yachts, racehorses and fine wines. Not only did they convince themselves of their own invincibility, but their glamour and sheer wealth blinded politicians into believing the alluring myths of the unfettered market.</p> <p>For Brown, who made it his mission from the early 1990s to woo London's money men, the reward for making sure regulators had a light touch and that taxes were low was a decade of turbo-charged growth, and the right to boast that the economic cycle of boom and bust was over.</p> <p>But while the banks were chalking up impressive profits, and driving growth, they were spoon-feeding Britain's consumers on a rich diet of cheap credit, which they gladly swallowed. The UK piled up the biggest debts in the G7 group of industrialised nations, sending up the price of homes from Cornwall to the Highlands of Scotland. Far from exercising Brown's cardinal virtue of prudence, consumers were saving less than at any time since the 1950s.</p> <p>The events of the past week may have played out among the larger-than-life characters of Wall Street, but on a smaller scale here at home they have finally slammed down the shutters on the era of cheap credit. For Britain's buy-now-pay-later, shop-till-you-drop economy, a mighty reckoning is now in store.</p> <p>For the staff of the investment bank Lehman Brothers, the reckoning came fast, last Monday morning. Glued to their BlackBerries all weekend for the latest news, they had pinned their hopes on a Sunday announcement of a government-brokered rescue, like the one Paulson clinched for Bear Stearns, then America's fifth-biggest investment bank, in March. But this time it was different. Dick Fuld, Lehman's abrasive chief, had stubbornly refused to countenance a series of offers to sell parts of his battered business, and Paulson thought he - and Wall Street - deserved to be taught a lesson.</p> <p>Lehman, he decided, must be left to sink or swim. 'He was effectively trying to identify \"insider money\" and \"outsider money\",' says Russell Jones, chief strategist at investment firm RBC Capital Markets. 'He was saying, \"Where an institution affects Main Street [outsider money], we'll save it; but where it only affects Wall Street [insider money], we won't\".'</p> <p>Barclays was one potential buyer for Lehman, and the head of Barclays Capital, Bob Diamond, flew out to New York to try to cut a deal. Paulson, however, refused to stump up any public cash to help rescue the 158-year-old institution - and the regulators back in London informed Diamond that they would need rock-solid assurances that bringing Lehman, with its billions of dollars of 'toxic' mortgage assets, under the wing of a British bank would not endanger the stability of the UK's financial system. Diamond walked away.</p> <p>Just before midnight on Sunday, its last chance exhausted, Fuld filed for bankruptcy, bringing down the curtain on an illustrious Wall Street dynasty - and rocking the financial world to its core.</p> <p>Back in London, where Chancellor Alistair Darling was in regular contact with Paulson, the prospect of such a high-profile casualty immediately set warning lights flashing. Lehman employed 5,000 staff in the UK at its swish Canary Wharf headquarters, whose jobs and livelihoods would be at risk; but Darling, and Financial Services Authority chairman Callum McCarthy knew that its collapse could ripple far beyond Docklands, to threaten the stability of Britain's entire banking system.</p> <p>Last Monday morning, as Lehman staff left Canary Wharf with boxes full of belongings, Darling held a fraught phone conference with McCarthy and Gordon Brown to discuss the risk that Lehman's collapse could so alarm investors that it would destabilise banks. Already, HBOS - which had tried and failed to raise \u00a34bn of cash from its shareholders in June - was in their sights. Later that day, Treasury officials, led by Darling's senior fixer Tom Scholar, began talking to HBOS about its future.</p> <p>Lloyds TSB, which had been hit less hard by the credit crunch than many of its rivals, first approached HBOS's ebullient boss, Andy Hornby, back in July. Despite the bungled fundraising, Hornby, once in charge of the George clothing range at Asda and a protege of retail millionaire and former Tory MP Archie Norman, was still determined he could go it alone.</p> <p>But the events of last Monday changed everything. As if Lehman's unseemly demise was not enough for the world's shocked investors to digest, Merrill Lynch, another mighty Wall Street broker brought low by rash bets on American mortgages, was swallowed up by its rival, Bank of America, in a hasty $50bn deal.</p> <p>Takeovers are hardly rare in banking; but for two such venerable Wall Street brands to disappear from the corporate jungle in a single day induced an alarming sense of vertigo among even the most hard-bitten investors.</p> <p>Economists call it 'contagion': the process by which the violent swings of mood caused by dramatic events in one financial market can rapidly spread around today's globalised world. From Moscow to Sydney, Paris to Beijing, investors dumped shares, wiping billions of dollars off the value of the world's companies, and poured cash into the traditional 'safe haven' asset of gold.</p> <p>On cable TV financial channel Bloomberg News on Monday night, usually the purveyor of bone-dry financial statistics, a ticker whizzed across the bottom of the screen that read 'Lehman staff clear desks, call headhunters, weep'.</p> <p>In the UK, all bank shares were pummelled, as investors began to think the unthinkable; but HBOS, long known to be woefully exposed to the shaky British property market, was most at risk. Its share price dropped by 18 per cent on Monday alone.</p> <p>That evening, Gordon Brown cornered Lloyds chairman Victor Blank at a party. Brown knew that if Lloyds was to succeed in rescuing HBOS, the government would have to throw its weight behind the deal by waiving competition rules.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning, Darling, McCarthy and Bank of England governor Mervyn King gathered at Number 11 Downing Street to review the unfolding crisis; and decided HBOS directors must be told that 'soldiering on wouldn't do'. The sense of crisis was heightened later that same day, when Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, announced he would use $85bn (\u00a346bn) of public funds to make an emergency loan to the American insurer AIG, the world's biggest - and sponsor of Manchester United.</p> <p>Under its charismatic former boss Hank Greenberg, AIG had transformed itself from an old-fashioned insurer into a whizzy financial player with a spider's web of complex bets, and it was now facing massive losses as a result of the Lehman collapse.</p> <p>Bernanke, who forged his reputation as an economics professor studying the catalogue of mistakes that turned the Wall Street crash of 1929 into the decade-long Great Depression, feared that allowing AIG to follow Lehman into the bankruptcy courts would leave its clients throughout the banking world dangerously vulnerable, and put the health of the whole financial system at risk.</p> <p>In London, meanwhile, there was rising concern that if talks between Lloyds and HBOS were not concluded fast, savers would begin queuing outside Halifax branches to withdraw their savings. Already, other banks had begun to withdraw some of their funds, the first sign that a run on the bank could be in the offing.</p> <p>The humiliating run on Northern Rock a year ago is seared into the government's collective memory. It was the most public evidence of a government losing control of Britain's economy since Norman Lamont had to stumble on to the steps of the Treasury on what became known as Black Wednesday, in 1992, to announce the pound's unceremonious departure from the European exchange rate mechanism.</p> <p>After 'the run on the Rock', as it became known, Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, said that 'outside the movies, a run on a bank is something that happens in a banana republic. That one should have happened, under our noses, in a mature and prosperous country like the UK, is almost unimaginable.'</p> <p>Brown was determined not to allow another run on his watch. On Wednesday morning, the Financial Services Authority issued a statement insisting that HBOS was 'a well-capitalised bank that continues to fund its business in a satisfactory way'; but by then, Blank, together with his chief executive Eric Daniels, was close to finalising a deal with Hornby.</p> <p>By Wednesday night, the \u00a310bn deal was done, and the Halifax, well-known to savers for its cheerful ads starring Howard the singing bank clerk, and the 300-year-old Bank of Scotland had been trampled under the thundering hooves of Lloyds' black horse. The credit crunch, once a distant drama played out on Wall Street, had well and truly come home to Britain's shores.</p> <p>On Thursday morning, a shattered-looking Hornby joined Daniels at a press conference in London to reveal the details of the deal. US-born Daniels gleefully announced that he would create a 'great British bank,' and promised to slash at least 10 per cent of costs as a result of the merger, implying that at least a tenth of the combined 140,000 staff facethe threat of redundancy - a fact not lost on Alistair Darling, who represents many of them in his Edinburgh South West constituency.</p> <p>While the HBOS takeover allowed investors in Britain to catch their breath, in the US the fallout from Lehman's collapse was spreading. Speculation was mounting about the health of the only two independent Wall Street brokers left standing - Morgan Stanley and the mighty Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>Morgan's boss John Mack, known as 'Mack the Knife' for his ruthless management style, was incandescent, complaining that speculators, in 'a market controlled by fear and rumour', were shorting Morgan's share price. But at the same time he began to talk to potential buyers, including the Chinese government, fearing Morgan might need to be rescued. There could hardly be a more potent illustration of the leaching of economic power east, from New York, to Beijing, Bangalore and Dubai, than these global titans scurrying to find a merger partner from China.</p> <p>On Thursday lunchtime in London's Bishopsgate, vendor Lorraine Cross, 57, was unlocking her news-stand, ready for the first edition of the Evening Standard. As the delivery of the first edition arrived, she pulled off the top sheet and exclaimed at the headline: 'God, look at this, Goldmans now!'</p> <p>A young American woman in a tan leather coat grabbed at the paper with trembling hands. 'That's my husband's firm, that's my husband,' she told Cross. She was led away by a friend, close to tears. 'Poor girl,' said Cross, 'but I have been here 36 years and I have been here for three lots of these big crises and it'll pick up again, it always does.'</p> <p>Her colleague Steve Jackson, 63, agreed. 'We've got no pensions and I had a letter the other day saying my endowment would be falling short and so I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for these flash boys playing with other people's lives just to buy their \u00a3400 bottles of wine and the rest.'</p> <p>For a group of builders taking a breather, it was clear that the effects of the financial meltdown would spread way beyond the Square Mile. 'It's bloody capitalism: the rich get richer and the rest of us pick up the pieces,' said Barry Solace, 38, from Greenwich. 'It's all negligence to have got into this state with so much money that they don't even know how to find it, never mind count it.' His colleague Ben Anderson nodded his head towards the building work behind them. 'It's a knock-on effect, isn't it? There were 10 contracts up in this area for building work and three have been cancelled. And when the work goes our jobs go, we're sacked, no pension, no big bonuses for us, nothing. It's always the same, the lower down the ladder you are, the worse off you are. The guys with the big bonuses might be losing a bit now, but they're already well set up.'</p> <p>Like the builders who have missed out on City contracts, some of the victims of last week's events are immediately visible: the hotdog sellers on Wall Street complaining about lack of business; the waitress in the champagne bar at Bishopsgate who raises an eyebrow when asked how many bottles of champagne she's sold. But there are many less visible victims, hit by the credit squeeze sucking funds back towards the embattled banks, as they scramble to get their finances in order.</p> <p>As the week went on, it became increasingly obvious that without more help one financial firm after another would fall victim to the vicious spiral of fear and greed that had brought down Lehman. So concerned did the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic become about the dizzy swings of the markets that they slapped a temporary ban on the short-selling of financial stocks, to prevent the share prices of any more banks falling off a cliff.</p> <p>And on Friday morning, Paulson finally went for the nuclear option, unveiling an audacious plan for Washington to spend 'hundreds of billions of dollars' of taxpayers' money on buying up the hard-to-value assets held by US banks, gathering them into a so-called 'bad bank', freeing their erstwhile owners to get back to business usual. The markets reacted jubilantly - in London, the FTSE 100 made its biggest ever one-day gain.</p> <p>Spending public cash to rescue the banks will be hugely controversial, and could leave America's taxpayers with hefty bills for years to come. But on Friday Paulson declared: 'I am convinced that this bold approach will cost American families far less than the alternative - a continuing series of financial institution failures and frozen credit markets unable to fund economic expansion.'</p> <p>And it's that great fear which has been at the hub of politicians' concerns throughout this crisis: how will the struggles of the banks hit Main Street - or Acacia Avenue?</p> <p>Long after the dust has settled on the past seven nerve-shredding days, the economic hangover from the credit boom will still be felt. Already, house prices in the UK have fallen by 10 per cent, economic growth has stalled and more than 100,000 jobs have been lost. But most analysts believe that we are slipping into at least a year of sickly economic growth, and it may be 2010 before any signs of a genuine recovery are visible.</p> <p>The US has already been in the grip of a housing crash for more than two years; but while prices continue to fall, and a growing number of poor homeowners default on their loans, the value of the complex mortgage-backed assets in banks' portfolios has continued to plummet. Banks have responded by tightening the loan taps in an effort to get their finances back in order; which in turn makes it harder to get a new mortgage, and accelerates the fall in house prices, which have already dropped by close to 20 per cent.</p> <p>Paulson and Bernanke hope last week's dramatic intervention will finally act as a circuit-breaker in this pernicious financial storm, which has already brought down some of Wall Street's biggest names - and swept thousands of the poorest Americans out of their homes. British banks will not be able to offload their toxic assets into Paulson's new 'bad bank', but the government hopes that the US moves will at least restore a sense of calm. 'It should draw most of the poison out of the system,' said one regulator this weekend.</p> <p>For the time being at least, Gordon Brown may just have become that rare commodity, a Prime Minister actually saved - rather than destroyed - by an economic catastrophe.</p> <p>When the resignation of Scottish minister David Cairns, with his potentially devastating admission that he could not in all conscience pretend he thought Brown could win an election, was relegated to the inside pages of Wednesday's newspapers by turmoil in the markets it became clear to Labour rebels that now was not the time to rise up against their leader.</p> <p>One minister who shares their despair at the government's plight said none the less that the City crisis had now made a truce essential: 'It's not that people will say, \"Gordon's the best man to deal with this\", because the public perception is that he was the Chancellor and completely identified with the economic policies that have got us here. It's that we will not look credible or responsible if while this such a crisis is ensuing we are engaging in internal warfare.'</p> <p>Labour MPs are already clamouring for a root-and-branch review of City regulation, further clampdowns on what the SNP leader Alex Salmond called the 'spivs and speculators' bringing banks to their knees, even curbs on City bonuses to limit risky activity - a call endorsed by none other than Labour chairman Harriet Harman, who made fat-cat pay part of her campaign for the deputy leadership on Friday.</p> <p>The Chancellor, who will address the party conference tomorrow, is under pressure to respond, and Treasury officials are hurriedly drawing up plans for a radical overhaul of financial regulation.</p> <p>But John McFall, the Labour chairman of the Commons Treasury select committee, warned that ministers should concentrate on sorting out the current crisis rather than being panicked into responding. 'I think there has to be a post mortem. The primary task is to get the financial community out of the gigantic hole into which they have put themselves. That is hugely important, and then after that is achieved we can have time to look at what undoubtedly needs to change.'</p> <p>The Tories' traditionally deregulatory instincts, meanwhile, have been shaken by the new political reality of millions of swing voters in Middle England angrily contemplating the wreckage of their pensions, share portfolios and - in some cases - careers. They are in no mood to hear, as the former Bank governor Eddie George suggested in a pamphlet for the Tory think-tank Politeia last week, that the City itself is better placed than the government to sort out its problems.</p> <p>Shadow chancellor George Osborne is demanding new powers for the Bank of England to intervene in the markets and greater protection for savers, to prevent panicking customers staging runs on another bank.</p> <p>The Conservative backbencher John Redwood, a former director of the merchant bank NM Rothschild and chair of David Cameron's economic competitiveness review, said it was time to restore the Bank of England's powers of oversight. 'The banks have managed to evolve a system that allows them to lend more in good times and stop lending in bad times. There's an overall answer, and that's more intelligent central banking that keeps the banks shorter of money in good times.</p> <p>The role of the Bank of England - and the Federal Reserve when under the control of former chairman Alan Greenspan - in fomenting the credit crisis is coming under fierce scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic. When both slashed interest rates to cushion their economies against recession after the dotcom bubble burst in 2000, the stage was set for an extraordinary credit binge.</p> <p>Jim O'Neill, chief global strategist at Goldman Sachs, says: 'Alan Greenspan ran too easy a monetary policy. I think already, one year on, the right questions are being asked: why were US real interest rates so low, for so long?'</p> <p>With Greenspan keeping the cheap money flowing, the banks became increasingly creative. Not content with the old-fashioned banker's job of taking in savers' deposits, and handing them out to worthy borrowers, they devised ever more ingenious methods of channelling billions of dollars of investors' cash, much of it from overseas, into high-risk loans to unsuspecting members of the public.</p> <p>Now the American banks are paying the ultimate price for this frenzied bout of 'financial innovation,' as they and their political backers called it - the promise of much harsher scrutiny; and the worst humiliation of all, nationalisation.</p> <p>The very financial masterminds who have spent the past decade urging governments to set free the 'wealth creators' and safeguard their 'competitiveness' have been brought under the control of Washington. And the government most associated with free-market capitalism and suspicion of state intervention has been forced to undertake the most costly nationalisation programme in living memory.</p> <p>In the US, Republican presidential candidate John McCain has criticised what he called 'failed regulation, reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street', and called for the sacking of Christopher Cox, the chairman of US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p> <p>Paulson may be promising that no expense will be spared as he rides to the rescue of America's bombed-out financial sector; but the quid pro quo is likely to be a large helping of humble pie.</p> <p>O'Neill, at Goldman, which itself came under fire last week, says Paulson has deliberately held the banks' feet to the fire. 'They were quite happy to see all of us in the private sector shaken up. If you look at what evolved with the unfolding of Lehman, we all have to think about the quality of the model we have got. While it feels traumatic, it doesn't half focus the mind.'</p> <p>Shaun Springer, chief executive of Napier Scott , the financial headhunter based in the City, said he was hoping to pick up a bit of business over the next few weeks as staff at Lehman and other troubled banks looked for new berths; but he knows that the golden age of the City is over.</p> <p>'What we are living through now will reverberate through the rest of the century in the same way the Great Depression did last century. We are witnessing a very real power shift. Money is moving eastwards - while they're creating wealth, we're losing it hand over fist. Where it ends no one knows.</p> <p>'London has enjoyed an unprecedented decade of global dominance. Let's hope people took lots of photos to look back on in the years to come'.</p>",
  "<p>Hollywood began sending itself up before the 'Hollywoodland' sign needed its second coat of paint, and indeed on his first visit to Los Angeles in the early 1920s the newly lionised young Scott Fitzgerald told Tinseltown's old lion DW Griffith that the best subject for the movies was cinema itself. Ben Stiller apparently had the idea for the latest of such movies while appearing in Spielberg's Second World War film Empire of the Sun 20 years ago and now has the power to realise it. His film Tropic Thunder, which he co-scripted with Etan Cohen and Justin Theroux, is a consistently amusing, sporadically hilarious, occasionally inspired comedy that sets out to expose the greed, stupidity and false values of Hollywood but sprays its targets as randomly as the machine-gun that runs out of control in The Wild Bunch.</p> <p>It begins with advertisements for the (non-existent) energy drink and chocolate bar that are subjects of product placement in a movie called 'Tropic Thunder'. Then there are trailers for new pictures featuring its three egocentric stars. Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) appears as a Rambo-style actor in the trailer for 'Scorchers VI: Global Meltdown'. Then there's Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) in a vulgar comedy of the sort in which Eddie Murphy has multiple roles as farting grotesques. The third trailer is for a deeply serious, infinitely sensitive drama starring the Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr) as a gay monk guiltily attracted to a fellow cleric. Fake trailers are not new. They figure in the middle of Stanley Donen's Movie Movie and the Tarantino-Rodriguez double-bill Grindhouse, though my favourite is the one in John Landis's The Kentucky Fried Movie for a Corman-style exploitation flick called 'Catholic High School Girls in Trouble.' But Stiller's ones are well done, and nicely set up the actors who are later to be seen in a TV showbusiness programme talking pretentiously about their current project and artistic problems.</p> <p>Then comes the movie, a parody of a realistic action flick with spurting blood and overflowing guts in the Private Ryan manner, which reconstructs a suicidal US rescue mission in 1969 Vietnam based on a book by the only survivor of the assault force, 'Four-Leaf' Tayback (Nick Nolte), a grizzled veteran who lost both hands in the incident. Speedman is playing the screen's version of 'Four Leaf' while the white Lazarus (an astonishing performance from Downey) is playing a black sergeant from the Deep South, and has lost himself in the character. Shooting in a remote corner of Vietnam and directed by a British filmmaker (Steve Coogan) incapable of handling the outrageous American stars, the film is a month behind schedule after five days' shooting. Back in Los Angeles a crazy, foul-mouthed producer, Les Grossman, alternately grimly menacing and warmly confidential, threatens to close the film and ruin everyone's career. Brilliantly played by a carefully disguised major star, Grossman is said to be modelled on a well-known Hollywood tycoon.</p> <p>So how is the movie-within-the-movie to be saved? The answer is by using the method of guerrilla cinema advocated by John Milius, who thought up Apocalypse Now while the Vietnam war was at its height. He wanted to take the actors to Nam and shoot the film with hand-held cameras in the combat zone. This is what the real 'Four-Leaf' Tayback suggests to the manic British director, and they set out to dump the five leads in the jungle: the three stars, plus two ambitious young minor actors, an African-American called Alpa Chino (Brandon T Jackson), who mocks the 'white negro' Lazarus, and the eager-beaver middle-American Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). The director has a cellphone to shoot close-ups, other cameras are to be concealed here and there, and a crazy explosives expert has set up a variety of devices to simulate enemy attacks. However, things go haywire. There are mines left from the French war in Indo-China of half-a-century ago, and the actors find themselves up against an enemy as ruthless as the Viet Cong in the form of native drug dealers ensconced in a jungle fortress. </p> <p>Real warfare ensues and the film goes off in several different directions. At one level it remains comic and satirical. There are jokes about the drug-addicted Jeff Portnoy trying to go cold turkey and becoming entranced by a mound of cocaine that resembles the mountain in Close Encounters, and Stiller is mocked for playing the mentally retarded hero of 'Simple Jack', a film that like Rain Man and Forrest Gump sits up and begs for an Oscar. At another level it resembles a gung-ho war movie and is photographed by John Toll who shot Braveheart and The Thin Red Line. At its most interesting, however, it takes up ideas of fiction and reality, acting and being. In Jean Genet's play The Balcony the pathetic patrons of a brothel in a police state, who are acting out their sexual fantasies as a bishop, a judge and general, are forced to assume these roles in public when a revolution breaks out and a real bishop, judge and general are killed. In 1968, Haskell Wexler wrote, photographed and directed Medium Cool, in which a TV journalist covers the tumultuous Democratic Convention in Chicago. Suddenly on the soundtrack someone shouts, 'Look out Haskell, it's real', and indeed, Wexler and his actors were in the middle of a real riot with Mayor Daley's cops tear-gassing the crowd. </p> <p>Stiller and Co toy with these resonant notions rather than examining them, but the rich confusion of themes and aims saves the film from being merely a series of spoofs and sketches like Airplane and Naked Gun. Yet with its Oscar-night coda, the film is ultimately an affectionate celebration of Hollywood values rather than something truly subversive like Sunset Boulevard.</p>",
  "<h2>Film</h2> <p><strong>Philip French</strong></p> <p>Soon after the birth of cinema moviemakers became crusaders for and proponents of human rights. The American pioneer Edwin S Porter followed his milestone western The Great Train Robbery (1903) with a hard-hitting film about equality before the law. In his The Kleptomaniac (1905), a wealthy woman and a poor working-class mother are arrested for shoplifting, the former treated with respect and acquitted, the latter treated as a criminal and jailed. The first great American film, DW Griffith's Birth of a Nation (1915), the most racially prejudiced film produced outside Nazi Germany, made heroes of the Ku Klux Klan for their virtual restoration of slavery in the Deep South after the Civil War. But Griffith followed it with the even more ambitious and truly admirable Intolerance (1916), which told four parallel stories of injustice from Babylon through the Crucifixion and the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre, to the conviction for murder of an innocent blue-collar worker in 20th-century America.</p> <p>With the coming of sound Hollywood developed a movie genre dealing with human rights, 'the social conscience picture', which in various forms has continued to this day. In the years after the Second World War these pictures were chiefly concerned with issues of racial prejudice: anti-semitism in Crossfire and Gentleman's Agreement (both 1947), the imposition of second-class citizenship on blacks in Pinky and Home of the Brave (both 1949). More recently, film-makers have targeted the denial of human and civil rights following 9/11 in such films as The Road to Guantanamo (2006) and Rendition (2007).</p> <p>Some movies have helped contribute to social change. The popular British film Victim (1961), for instance, speeded up the implementation of homosexual law reform recommended by the Wolfenden Committee. The Polish movie A Short Film About Killing (1988) led directly to the suspension, then abolition, of capital punishment in Poland, an influence unprecedented in a communist country. </p> <p>A similar courage is to be found in the work of those Iranian directors who have challenged censors and ayatollahs in a string of pictures criticising the treatment of women in their country, Jafar Panahi's The Circle and Marziyeh Meshkini's The Day I Became a Woman (both 2000) among them. </p> <p>No recent picture has so forcefully shown what it is like to live in a country where human and civil rights are denied or arbitrarily accorded by the government as The Lives of Others (2006), Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's picture of life under the constant surveillance of the Stasi in 1980s East Germany. It won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Of living directors, few can match the record of Richard Attenborough for the vigorous support of human rights both on and off the screen. One thinks especially of the brave movie he produced and appeared in about a trade unionist victimised by communist leaders in The Angry Silence (1960), and of two he directed - the magnificent cinebiography Gandhi (1982) and his film about Steve Biko and the anti-apartheid movement, Cry Freedom (1987). One hopes Attenborough will live to realise his dream of making a film about that great proponent of freedom and social justice Thomas Paine, author of The Rights of Man.</p> <h2>Pop</h2> <p><strong>Kitty Empire</strong></p> <p>Human rights have always had a backbeat. Since a cave-dweller first put antelope femur to skin drum, songs have yearned for whatever people have lacked. Abundant prey, a good harvest, freedom from harm - fundamental versions of what we have since enshrined as basic human rights. </p> <p>Folk music has long had a crusading role in Anglophone society, documenting the plight of the downtrodden and inveighing against tyranny. Around the world, every human population has its own version, in which discontents are articulated and justice is longed for. To enumerate only the briefest highlights would take up most of The Observer's column inches this week. To explore properly the interfaces of music and humanist concerns - Band Aid, War Child, Make Trade Fair, Sting's support for Amazonian tribespeople, the works of Bono -would take a month of Sundays.</p> <p>Instead, consider this spur-of-the-moment, idiosyncratic and personal Top of the Human Rights Pops.</p> <p>At Number Three, Tori Amos with 'Cornflake Girl'. Amos's 1994 single made it to No 4 in the UK charts. To this day, few realise that it is about the horrors of female circumcision, and the betrayal of daughters by their own mothers in the name of tradition and social cohesion.</p> <p>At Number Two, Billie Holiday, 'Strange Fruit'. Originally a poem by a Jewish teacher from New York, 'Strange Fruit' is a visually sumptuous song about the lynching of black men in the American South. Pre-dating the Civil Rights movement and inspiring Bob Dylan, it is still chilling today.</p> <p>At Number One, Woody Guthrie's 'This Land Is Your Land'. Incredibly, every North American schoolchild learns this song, in which folk scion and Communist sympathiser Guthrie takes a magic realist stroll through the American landscape, asserting communal ownership of the land in a way Native Americans might have understood. The beauty and bounty of the continent, Guthrie implies, should be shared by all its inhabitants, banishing hunger, want, and subjugation. The equality of all who live there is a moot point. There are two even more political verses, little sung, decrying mass unemployment and private property. Even without these, 'This Land Is Your Land' is a deeply powerful, subliminal hymn of egalitarianism nestled in the very bosom of the deeply unequal, free-market Dark Star.</p> <h2>Books</h2> <p><strong>Jonathan Heawood</strong></p> <p>With a neat sense of timing, George Orwell completed Nineteen Eighty-Four just a week before the publication of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in December 1948. While Eleanor Roosevelt's committee produced the template for a better future, Orwell was busy imagining the alternative - a world without individual rights, where freedom and autonomy become illusions manufactured by an all-seeing, all-powerful state. He reminded generations of readers that our rights require vigilance and personal sacrifice if they are to be worth more than the paper they're written on.</p> <p>Orwell's legacy lives on in novels from Philip K Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (1968) - better known as the film Blade Runner - to The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood (1985), in which a dystopian future society is used to explore the absence of human rights. In both books, a class of being (androids, women) is categorised as subhuman, and therefore unworthy of the same rights as others and they convey a sense of the universality of rights more powerfully than any legal tract.</p> <p>Great novels such as Boris Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago (1957), Manuel Puig's Kiss of the Spider Woman (1976) or JM Coetzee's Life and Times of Michael K (1983) may not namecheck the declaration, but their profound sense of injustice is animated by its promise of a better world.</p> <p>Wherever novelists evoke the plight of the individual floundering in an unjust world, human rights are at risk. These novels bring us face to face with the real meaning of universal values as they apply to individual lives.</p> <p>Human-rights abuses over the past 60 years have not been confined to fiction. In The Gulag Archipelago (1973), Alexander Solzhenitsyn described the horrors of his own imprisonment in a Soviet labour camp, and collected the testimony of 227 fellow survivors. The book led to his exile from the Soviet Union, but it opened up the hidden tragedy of millions of political prisoners to the eyes of the world. The sheer weight of historical record, and the ironic power of his writing, which is often surprisingly humorous, emphasised the brutality inherent in the Soviet system. Many people refused to believe his account when it was published. Now we know the truth to have been far worse.</p> <p>In Wild Swans (1991), Jung Chang showed how the abuse of rights can carry its pain right to the heart of the family, with a knock-on effect down the generations. With a similar emphasis on the fate of women, Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel Persepolis (2000) introduced the world to the tortured history of freedom in Iran. And Orhan Pamuk's strange, magical novel Snow (2002) exploded the myth of Turkish multiculturalism. It is no accident that these authors have suffered censorship and worse in their home countries. States that don't respect rights don't respect writers.</p> <p>Philosophers such as John Rawls, in A Theory of Justice (1971), and Ronald Dworkin, in Taking Rights Seriously (1977), have helped to bring the idea of fundamental rights into the legal mainstream, but it is the great novelists and memoirists of the past 60 years who have done most to embed human rights in the global consciousness. Most people will never read the declaration. They will never know how deeply their rights are being abused by their rulers. But if they read Wild Swans they get an overwhelming sense of what it means to live without rights. This is the first time in human history that international law has existed to defend the powerless against the powerful. But the great literature of this period is accurate in its reflection of a world which has more in common with Orwell's nightmares than the UN's dreams. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jonathan Heawood is the director of English PEN</p> <h2>Architecture</h2> <p><strong>Stephen Bayley</strong></p> <p>Modern architecture does not readily lend itself to campaigning, though modern technology made human rights possible. Item one: without the fax machine there would have been no glasnost. The truth makes you free and the clunking fax (created pre-internet so that time-shifted Japanese salarymen could receive written messages) was truth's tireless runner. Item two: the Land-Rover, like the declaration, a product of 1948, has been a liberating tool on every continent.</p> <p>But there is a small handful of buildings which work as the architecture of memory and remind us of what's at stake when freedoms become compromised. On the Ile de la Cit\u00e9 in Paris, Georges-Henri Pingusson built his haunting M\u00e9morial des Martyrs de la D\u00e9portation in 1962. It is a deafeningly silent and exquisite memorial to the 200,000 (mostly) Jews forced out of Paris during the Second World War.</p> <p>There is Daniel Libeskind's 2001 Jewish Museum on Berlin's Lindenstrasse. A concrete structure with dramatic zinc cladding, its zig-zag plan looks like a diagram of angst ... and a vital sign of resurrection. Sombre, but ultimately optimistic, it makes a wonderful contrast to Beijing's appalling Great Hall of the People, an inhuman horror completed in 1959 by what the communists are pleased to call 'volunteers', but we might more accurately call ideologic and economic slaves.</p> <p>But if human rights needs a single monument, let's choose Peter Zumthor's Bruder Klaus Feldkapelle, completed last year just outside Cologne. The Brother Klaus Field Chapel is named after a 15th-century mystic who farmed hereabouts. In his memory Zumthor has created one of the 21st century's undisputed masterpieces. Making a sort of wigwam of wood, he slowly built layer upon layer upon it. He then set fire to the wood leaving a strange charred, sculptural internal effect. A molten lead floor is lit by an oculus. It is beautiful, peaceful, mysterious and life-enhancing. Aren't these the qualities human rights are for?</p>",
  "<p>What with Alastair Campbell to advise him on trust, as well as battalions of fellow pariahs offering notes for Mr Brown's Speech of a Lifetime, one hesitates, at this late stage, to propose yet another theme, even one as mesmerising as rubbish. But if, as some experts suggest, the Prime Minister should now say anything to stay in power, regardless of the cost to consistency, decency and the quality of his personal afterlife, there cannot be many other promises that would be both so easily fulfilled and so pleasing to a resentful public as a national garbage amnesty, introduced with immediate effect.</p> <p>Imagine the acclaim if Brown went further in realising the British householder's dream: a pledge of two, maybe three capacious rubbish bins for each hardworking family, tax-breaks for the most prolific rubbish producers, or better still, a new right-to-trash that guaranteed every citizen a dedicated landfill site right outside his home, with the warming effluvia diverted to supply year-round patio heating. At once, the public would be liberated from onerous garbage-sorting duties, and, more important, Brown would win the approval of various influential newspapers whose reports, more chilling by the day, chronicle the suffering of rubbish-bin martyrs, as they find themselves tricked into using smaller bags, forced to recycle, subjected to outrages that range from rubbish-weighing, crippling penalties and spies in bins to the fortnightly collections that initially inspired the Daily Mail's campaign for rubbish-disposal satisfaction, its Great Bin Revolt.</p> <p>Not that this protest, along with similar coverage in like-minded papers, has done much to reverse the attack on individual landfill rights by pitiless garbage operatives: only last week bin campaigners learned that successful trials of recycling food waste might lead, in time, to all households being obliged to use a sordid food caddy instead of, as before, leaving this unwanted organic material to rot, in civilised fashion, within the confines of black dustbin bags. 'It's like going back to the Dark Ages,' protested one householder, one of a minority who refused to use one of the detested 'slop buckets'.</p> <p>Given that any speech of a lifetime should feature, for the sake of variety, allusions to humble folk, Brown might want to cite a few more unidentifiable but very individual rubbish victims: the penniless pensioner recently sentenced to 15 years for not rinsing her milk bottles; the cheeky six-year-old summarily executed by a member of the bin Stasi who now patrol the country's dustbins, seemingly a law unto themselves. And it gets worse. Last Friday the Mail revealed that inspectors from Blackburn could easily have frightened a defenceless old lady, had she existed, when they looked over a fence to check on the number of wheelie bins per household. 'The move is the latest draconian rubbish collection measure,' the Daily Mail told readers. </p> <p>What shocks is how recently, yet with what stealth, this erosion of precious liberties appears to have been effected. Barely a decade ago most householders inhabited a rubbish Eden in which you could fill as many black bags as you liked, with more or less whatever you liked, and put them out without thought for weight, collection times, or the bags' final resting place, in one of the convenient dumps with which this happiest of countries then abounded. The beginning of the end came in 1999, when the EU landfill directive required Britain (which had so often come top, or thereabouts, for quantities of waste deposited per capita), to meet EU recycling targets or be fined into compliance; targets the government later passed on to local councils via limited allocation of landfill, again enforced by fines. Legislation designed to get householders to co-operate, finally resulted, earlier this summer, in Ian Gibson, a Labour MP, declaring - too late! - that something inexpressibly precious had gone for ever. 'It is a British way of life to have your bin emptied once a week,' he said. 'Taking that away is like losing your birthright.'</p> <p>If Brown does not have the guts to resist this assault on his country's values, the Conservatives have people who will. Well; it has one person. Shadow local government secretary Eric Pickles has made it his mission to fight for rubbish liberty; so much so that no draconian-measures story is now complete without an observation from Mr Pickles along the lines that Labour has created 'an army of municipal bin bullies hitting law-abiding families with massive fines while professional criminals get the soft touch'. </p> <p>One might attribute this aversion to bin bullies to a preference for softer, more Nudge-style techniques were it not for a recent letter, sent around Tory-run councils, in which Pickles himself threatened the addressees with nasty consequences if they got involved with Labour 'pay as you throw' pilot schemes (which, if implemented, would bring this country into line with arrangements that already operate, in the absence of civil unrest, all over Europe).</p> <p>First, Eric prophesied, bin taxes would bring down grievous want upon families who would be punished 'for having children'. One had no idea so many were routinely thrown away. Then, 'the politics of rubbish is very high on the media's agenda and a great cause of public concern. Councils that introduce bin taxes will be vilified in the popular press and punished at the polls.' Though, of course, the relevant councils might not be quite so vilified in the press were it not for the assistance of leading rubbish celebrity, Mr Eric Pickles. </p> <p>Given that he does not, in principle, oppose recycling, it remains unclear why Pickles should be so averse to tactics that are consistently increasing recycling rates, and, indeed, widely enforced by lowlier members of his own party. For any right-wing newspaper, I suppose, these tales of bin-related persecution can be seen as the latest, mischief-making variation on the hapless little-guy, jobsworth-defying genre; part of a couldn't-make-it up continuum that also features John Bull's God-given right to park where he likes and drive as fast as he likes; to physically chastise his children without the interference of Childline and to bequeath a lifetime's cheap petrol to his conker-hardened descendants. But Pickles is more puzzling. </p> <p>Does his commitment to the conservation of reeking landfill show us what Cameron's Tories truly feel, behind that husky picture, about pro-environmental measures? Or should we look more deeply at Mr Pickles, and ask if there may not be some psychological quirk that accounts for this obsession with waste products? He would not be the first. One recalls Alastair Campbell's ostentatious attachment to the word garbage, to the point that he distributed copies of the band Garbage's CD, and prided himself on inventing a little known variation, 'garbagic'. But as painful as it is to admit, garbagic's moment may have come. In a rubbish-filled time with a rubbish economy and rubbish politicians, there has never been a greater need for new words for rubbish, particularly one coined by a man whose contribution to our national life was, in itself, such spectacular rubbish.</p>",
  "<p>No wonder people have started to refer to Newcastle's home as Sid James' Park. But the carry on is beginning to lose its comedy value. It is simply alarming, that a football club which has been so heavily invested in over the past few years can be in such a state of disrepair. While teams below them mustered results, Newcastle continued to sink, finishing the day second bottom of the Premier League, above only Tottenham.</p> <p>They surrendered here so predictably, only starting to resemble a team when they were already 3-0 down. West Ham were allowed to look almost effortless as they cruised to an unassailable advantage, inspired by debutant David Di Michele, a stylish scorer and creator.</p> <p>Gianfranco Zola could not have wished for a more generous opening fixture. West Ham did not make a song and dance of introducing Zola to his new disciples, but despite the inference in some circles that his Chelsea connections might not make him instantly popular, the home crowd broke into warm applause when Zola emerged from his seat to patrol the technical area. Typically of the man, he later felt compelled to apologise to the fans for the fact he didn't wave back. 'I didn't hear them,' he said bashfully. 'My mind was closed I had so much to think about. This is a new adventure for me, and I have been nervous every single minute of the week.'</p> <p>They are certainly warming to diminutive Italians in these parts. Zola must have been purring with the rest of them as Di Michele made a dazzling early contribution. On seven minutes Newcastle stood off the striker from Torino, who cut inside Fabricio Coloccini and danced past Steven Taylor. Seizing the moment, he shot, and watched with delight as the ball ricocheted off Taylor and David Edgar, and looped over Shay Given.</p> <p>Di Michele struck again eight minutes before the break when he latched on to Mark Noble's defence splitting pass. Given did well to deny him with the kind of bravery all too often asked of him when he is left totally exposed, but West Ham's new boy made light work of finishing at the second time of asking. He flicked the ball into space and onto his clever left foot, in order to steer into the bottom corner.</p> <p>Di Michele is tiny enough to make Michael Owen look a fine physical specimen, and the way he and Matthew Etherington buzzed around the target man Carlton Cole encouraged Zola. 'From my point of view David should share the fame with the other strikers,' he said, before boldly predicting that Cole could play for England should he make the kind of improvements Zola wants.</p> <p>Any slim chance Newcastle might have had for a revival disappeared early in the second half when Owen headed weakly at Robert Green. West Ham immediately broke upfield to clinch the game. Di Michele showed off his prowess for an assist when he cantered down the right and curved a delightful pass for Etherington to sidefoot in West Ham's third with aplomb.</p> <p>Just as it seemed nothing would go for Newcastle ever again, Owen jinked inside Lucas Neill and cracked a super finish into the bottom corner. Suddenly Newcastle discovered some verve as Cl\u00e1udio Ca\u00e7apa and Damien Duff had chances to eat away at West Ham's lead. Zola will have learned something about the vulnerability of his new club by observing how anxiously they defended a 3-1 lead on home soil.</p> <p>But the moment that summed it all up fell to substitute Lu\u00eds Boa Morte, whose astonishing stoppage-time miss united both sets of supporters. They didn't know whether to laugh or boo. Some even did both.</p> <p>This had, at times, felt a little like the derby of the doomed, with so many people in the crowd wearing either XL or Northern Rock upon their chests. West Ham, having last week covered over their fallen sponsor's name with a patch of claret, preferred a big white square with each player's number on it this time. It looked even more conspicuous. 'You're not flying anymore,' sang the Toon Army brightly. They were met with a round of applause. It was a neat assessment on the Premier League's most poorly run clubs by the people who pay to watch them.</p> <p>The fact West Ham appear to be moving on from their own managerial farce only served to emphasise the shambles that continues at Newcastle. 'The sooner things get sorted the better,' admitted stand-in manager Chris Hughton. 'That has been the case from day one and until that happens we just have to try to get results.' Three defeats and counting makes the situation acute.</p> <p>If Mike Ashley seriously thinks he can hang on for his \u00a3481m asking price for Newcastle United, he is in for a depressingly long wait.</p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong></p> <p><strong>Hamish Mackay, Observer reader</strong></p> <p>In the first half the Geordies sang 'You're not flying any more', referring to our bust former sponsors, XL. In the end we were the ones flying and we should have won by more. Newcastle were poor and Zola's influence was seen from the start: we played with the ball on the ground for the whole match and kept possession well. Parker was outstanding in midfield and Di Michele had a good game too - he looks top...#8209;class, scored two and should have had a hat-trick. I can't wait to see him when he's fully fit. Zola must think management is easy. I don't care about his Chelsea connection. He was a great player and knows how to play football the right way.<br><strong><br>The fan's player ratings</strong> Green 6; Faubert 6, Neill 6, Upson 7, Ilunga 4; Behrami 6, Noble 7, Parker 8 (Mullins 5), Etherington 7 (Boa Morte 3); Di Michele 8, Cole 7 (Sears 5)</p> <p><strong>Des Kindley, NUFC-London.com</strong></p> <p>Nothing surprises me at Newcastle. However, it wasn't really surprising that Ashley and Wise weren't at this match considering the stick they would have got. The result flattered West Ham, as two of the goals looked like deflections and came from the side Edgar was playing and the way he performed he was rightly taken off. I think the signings made under Ashley are good and he's changed the way the system operates so we're not spending a fortune on players. We are suffering from injuries, though, and we missed Guti\u00e9rrez. Most of all we need a manager, as this guy in charge has a good track record as a number two, but makes some strange selections, like starting with Ameobi as a centre-forward last week.</p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> Given 7; Edgar 5 (Bassong 6), Taylor 5, Coloccini 6, N'Zogbia 7; Geremi 6, Ca\u00e7apa 5 (Gonz\u00e1lez 6), Butt 6, Duff 6;Owen 7, Xisco 6</p> <p><em><strong>To take part in the verdict, email<br>fans@observer.co.uk</strong></em></p>",
  "<p>As Aditya Chakrabortty argued in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/economics.creditcrunch\">an article for Cif</a> last month, in the midst of an economic crisis that should provide fertile ground for new ideas and alternative thinking, the left is frustratingly quiet. While a volatile economy wreaks its cyclical havoc upon millions for whom making ends meet is a struggle even in good times, opponents of the current order have little to offer.</p> <p>Although there's a clear need for a return to a more robust regulatory framework, the Keynesian prescription that worked miracles after 1945 is not so suited to today's world. It's difficult to see, for example, how Keynesian demand management could return the economy to genuine full employment given technological advances and the global market for labour on which employers now have to draw. </p> <p>This weekend's <a href=\"http://www.conventionoftheleft.org/\">Convention of the Left</a>, which includes all the usual suspects in its list of participants, is unlikely to come up with workable ideas for creating an economy which encourages stability, efficiency and social justice. For most on the left, like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/18/labour.economy\">Jon Cruddas</a>, a more inclusive society remains dependent on our creating a more redistributive state. </p> <p>But is an economy which promotes minority wealth and privilege and requires the state to tax the beneficiaries to support those it excludes really the only alternative to the current order? An agenda based on the redistribution of wealth rather than the redistribution of opportunity can only ever deliver justice as compensation; mitigating the worst effects once the damage is done. It is morally unambitious and likely to fail in the long run because by taxing the beneficiaries more heavily, the wealth-generating capacity of an already underemployed economy is further compromised.</p> <p>The left is stuck for ideas because it lacks a credible economics of social justice. It still relies on a Marxian analysis which, in terms of its underlying economic theory, suffers the same flaws as the neo-classical theory that underpins both the Keynesian approach and the free-market ideology of the last three decades. There is a general assumption that the global economic framework is unassailable because its economics is \"proven\" beyond doubt. The left may indeed be short of new ideas, but so too are the right.</p> <p>As I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/15/radicalsolutions\">reported here</a> a while back, much work is being done to elaborate a new understanding of economics; one which can deliver both efficiency and social justice. It has yet to penetrate the economic establishment because, as Aditya <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/15/radicalsolutions?commentid=0383caeb-bf1d-4383-a8a9-908e4ded23b8\">pointed out</a> after that piece, diverse schools of thought have yet form a coherent alternative to mainstream thinking. But the publication of an impressive new book could signal the beginning of a much needed revolution in economics.</p> <p>Brian Hodgkinson's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Model-Economy-Brian-Hodgkinson/dp/0856832502/\">A New Model of the Economy</a> deftly pulls together many strands of alternative economic thought and presents them in a format \u2013 an economics textbook \u2013 which no economist can easily dismiss. </p> <p>He begins by distinguishing between the kind of economic freedom that would give all citizens fair access to the means to a meaningful and productive role in society, and the current sham freedom to accumulate immense personal wealth, which can only ever be enjoyed by a small minority. </p> <p>He goes on to decry the failure of conventional economics to acknowledge the pivotal role of land. As work and space constitute the \"primary requirements of human existence, the conditions under which land is available is of fundamental significance\". He explains how, even in a post-industrial economy like that of the UK where financial services dominate, the way land is treated has a massive impact on social outcomes.</p> <p>In the first half of the book, Hodgkinson presents a revised theory of the firm, the basis for all study of microeconomics. He explains how the established version is woefully deficient and supports this assertion with beautifully reproduced graphs and diagrams; the staple diet of serious students of economics. As he builds his case, the subtle but fundamental differences between his graphs and those that illustrate the standard economics texts bring home just how damaging shortcomings in the conventional view really are. Just as anthropology was hi-jacked in the 19th century to justify the racist policies of colonial domination, so, it appears, an equally fallacious rendering of economics was applied to justify the continuation of a society based on minority wealth and privilege.</p> <p>For those not excited at the prospect of poring over marginal cost curves and the like, Hodgkinson draws on the best of Smith, Ricardo, Schumpeter and Keynes to make his case. His assessment, and rigorous updating, of the established macro-economic model is if anything more devastating. He includes chapters on housing, trade, the business cycle, financial speculation and the problems associated with the way banks are allowed to create money as debt.</p> <p>As James Robertson argues in <a href=\"http://www.jamesrobertson.com/newsletter.htm#hodgkinson\">his review</a>, Hodgkinson might have given more space to the environment, especially as the new economics he outlines lends itself more readily than the current model to the challenges of global warming and resource depletion. But he nonetheless provides a good foundation for a new green economics.</p> <p>The policy conclusions he arrives at will doubtless make many uncomfortable, especially the notion that while land should remain under private ownership, the rent it earns should become public revenue. But better than any previous advocate of such land reform, Hodgkinson explains the knock-on effects of that reform for all aspects of the economy. His conclusions are the only possible conclusions from an exercise in economic theorising which is both acutely rational and shot through with a moral conviction that economists have lacked for far too long.</p> <p>Robert Skidelsky was only partly right <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/17/marketturmoil.usa\">to ask</a> \"are market economies 'naturally' stable or do they need to be stabilised by policy?\" The market economy will not be stabilised by any set of policies which fails to recognise shortcomings in the underlying economics. But a stable, efficient and just economy, and one that enhances the freedom of all citizens, could be constructed on the revised theoretical foundations provided by Brian Hodgkinson in this remarkable book.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown may have made it to his second autumn party conference as Labour leader, but if today's papers are anything to go by, this week's gathering in Manchester could well be his last.</p> <p>Writing in <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/\">The Independent</a>, Andrew Grice reports that <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-rebels-call-truce-in-their-attempt-to-oust-brown-936155.html\">rebel Labour MPs have called a \"truce\" in their battle to oust the prime minister</a> because they fear a voter backlash if they undermine him during the global financial crisis.</p> <p>However, the fact that this tactical retreat may only be a temporary ceasefire is reflected in some of the interviews with cabinet heavyweights published to coincide with the opening of the conference.</p> <p>Jack Straw, the justice secretary, who headed Brown's leadership campaign, insists in today's <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/\">Telegraph</a> that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/2992327/Jack-Straw-We-have-to-come-together-not-fall-apart.html\">Labour can win the next election if the party unites around its leader</a>.</p> <p>The cabinet veteran is considered one of the few people in a position to tell the prime minister that his time is up, but instead, Straw takes the opportunity to remind Brown's critics of the need for self-discipline.</p> <p>\"The experience of the 70s and 80s teaches you that you have to hold together,\" he says.</p> <p>But his doubt about Brown's future is evident in the subtext; asked what odds he puts on Labour winning the next election, Straw says simply: \"I'm not a bookie.\"</p> <p>In one of the most significant developments, <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4791378.ece\">Alan Johnson, the health secretary, used an interview in the Times</a> today to rule himself out of any future leadership contest and seemed to be positioning himself as a possible running mate for David Miliband, the foreign secretary and frontrunner to replace Brown.</p> <p>In a two-page feature-style interview, Johnson insists he would rather be a pop star than prime minister, but he reveals the mood of the cabinet is \"not very jolly\".</p> <p>The health secretary adds: \"David [Miliband] is a real talent in the team. Where he goes in the future is for the future and I hope he goes a long way because I am a big fan of his.\"</p> <p>In a separate interview in the Times Magazine, Miliband is careful not to reignite another leadership row but the softly-softly five-page article paints a portrait of a clever, articulate and self-effacing leader in waiting. The Tories \"are beatable\" he says - he just omits to say which Labour leader might beat them.</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/09/20/david-miliband-spells-out-his-vision-on-eve-of-labour-conference-115875-20745391/\">foreign secretary used an interview in the Daily Mirror</a> to make an impassioned plea for party unity.</p> <p>\"It's time to pull together,\" he said. \"I've made it clear I don't think it's time for a leadership election.\"</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/sep/20/labourconference.education\">the Guardian, Ed Balls</a>, the schools secretary and Brown's closest political ally, sets out to show the leadership is getting on with the job, with new plans to win the hearts and minds of school staff.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Gordon Brown will be answering questions in a live Q&amp;A session from around 3.40pm. Joining the prime minister will be Alistair Darling, the chancellor, Harriet Harman, Labour's deputy leader, Yvette Cooper, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and John Hutton, the business secretary. Click back then for live coverage.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>4pm:</strong> The timetable is running late. It looks as if the Brown Q&amp;A won't start for another 15 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>4pm:</strong> Ed Miliband is speaking at the moment. He's doing a Cameron/Clegg and reciting it without any notes.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>4.10pm:</strong> Miliband has finished. As a warm-up act, Brown could not have asked for more, because Miliband paid lavish tribute to him.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>4.15pm:</strong> Dianne Hayter, the chair, says the Q&amp;A will be devoted to the economy because of what has happened in the financial markets over the last seven days.</p> <p>The session starts with some YouTube footage showing questions from people who want to know what the government will do to help them.</p> <p>Hayter introduces the ministers. She says there is \"no one better qualified\" to deal with the UK's problems.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>4.15pm: </strong> Brown moves to the front of the platform and welcomes delegates, especially those from the northern cities \"that that Conservative thinktank [Policy Exchange] wanted to abandon\". The delegates aren't sure whether to laugh or not. They applaud mildly. He also says that, with the JK Rowling donation, Labour now has \"magic\" behind it. This gets a mild laugh.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>4.20pm:</strong> Moving on to the economy, Brown says nobody would have imagined the events of recent days. With the American government now controlling AIG, that makes the American government \"the shirt sponsors of Manchester United\". Come to think of it, in the light of Northern Rock Alistair Darling is the shirt sponser of Newcastle United, he says.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4.20pm:</strong> Brown says the government will do \"whatever it takes\" to protect people in the current environment. That's why the government facilitated the HBOS/Lloyds TSB takeover.</p> <p>The government is trying to get \u00a38m back from the US to pay the money owed to the Lehman Brothers staff who lost their jobs - not the high-paid bankers, but people like the cleaners.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4.25 pm:</strong> At testing times, \"this is not about public relations\". The real test is the judgment you make. The government could have let Northern Rock fall. That was the Conservative party position, he says. But the government brought it into public ownership to save jobs and savings.</p> <p>And the Conservatives were also in favour of doing nothing over HBOS, he says. But the government disagreed.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>4.25 pm:</strong> He says the Tories are in favour of taking away all regulation from mortgages (which is not quite true - it was proposed by a commission chaired by John Redwood, but it was never adopted as party policy). Brown contrasts that with the government's pro-regulatory stance.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>4.25pm:</strong> A testing time \"is not just a test of your judgment, it's a test of your values\". You could leave people on their own. Or you could choose to stand beside people.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>4.25pm:</strong> There must be a text of Brown's remarks. I've just checked on <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/conference\">the Labour conference website</a> and it's not there yet. But try it later.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>4.25pm:</strong> Brown has wound up now with a peroration about serving all the people of the country.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>4.30pm:</strong> Hayter invites questions. A delegate wants to know what Brown can say to people worried about losing their jobs. Another asks about fairness in the workplace. And a delegate from the TSSA, a rail union, wants to know why the government only got round to banning short-selling on Thursday, and why the ban will only last until January.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>4.30pm:</strong> On the threat to jobs, Brown says the situation now is better than it was in the early 1990s, interest rates are lower, company balance sheets are in better health and public investment is higher. The government has also been working to get oil prices down.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>4.35pm:</strong> Darling takes over. He agrees that the government must do something about workers who are forced to go self-employed. On short-selling, he says there are different kinds of short-selling. Sometimes it can be useful, because it provides firms with funds. But the present crisis was created because banks did not understand the extent of their liabilities.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>4.35pm:</strong> Darling pays tribute to the work Brown did as chancellor.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>4.40pm:</strong> Harman intervenes to say a few words. She says that while \"Alistair and Gordon\" are taking big decisions, ordinary people are also having to take difficult decisions as a result of the credit crunch. \"We're taking these big decisions because we know people are concerned about decisions in their lives.\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>4.40pm:</strong> Another round of questions. A delegate says the party ought to concentrate on \"real issues\" and not \"indulgent issues of leadership\". The conference should send a message of unity. She gets a good round of applause. \"I think the conference agrees with you,\" says Hayter.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>4.45pm:</strong> Cooper picks up on a question on housing. She says the government has already taken steps to help get first-time buyers into the market.</p> <p>Darling is talking about financial regulation now. It needs to be \"robust\".</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>4.50pm:</strong> Brown says \"the eyes of the country\" are upon Labour. They want the party to be discussing issues that relate to their jobs and their livelihoods. That should be the \"undivided focus\" of the party. That's his message to the rebels, ie shut up. It's about as explicit as he's got.</p> <p>He stresses that money is moving across frontiers now in a way that it wasn't a decade ago. There has to be a global system of regulation and supervision. Trade unions know that they have to organise internationally. Brown says he's been making this point for years.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>4.50pm:</strong> It's been a good afternoon for Brown so far. There's been no dissent on the conference floor and he's already made two speeches, a tribute to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2008/sep/20/labour.labourconference1\">Philip Gould</a> and the introduction to this session.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>4.55pm:</strong> One delegate asks if recent events have diminished Brown's faith in free markets. And - oops, it looks as if my remarks about dissent were a bit premature. A delegate from local government asks if Brown realises how demoralised people are in the public sector.</p> <p>And another delegate asks about support for the developing world.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>4.55pm:</strong> Hutton takes the question about free markets. He says the party supports fair markets, but that where consumers are being ripped off, the government has a duty to intervene.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>4.55pm:</strong> Darling says its important to remember that the purpose of a supervisory system is to ensure fairness. (In case you hadn't noticed, fairness is the theme of the conference).</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>4.55pm:</strong> Darling takes the question about morale in the public sector. Guessing that the delegate was referring to pay, he says pay has to be fair. But it's important not to allow inflation to become entrenched in the system. That would harm people on fixed incomes, but would not affect the wealthy.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>5pm:</strong> Cooper says pay restraint should apply from the top down. This is not the year we should be seeing big pay increases at the top.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>5.00pm:</strong> Brown says he's not complacent. But no government has done as much as this one to expand the public sector since 1997. He understands people's frustration about wages. But there is a danger that wage increases could be wiped out if inflation were allowed to run out of control.</p> <p>\"We're a party that believes markets are in the public interest, but they are not to be equated with the public interest,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>5.05pm:</strong> Brown also makes quite a nice joke about Nick Clegg. \"We have a Liberal leader who thinks that the pension is \u00a330.\" Maybe that's because, after the \u00a320bn Lib Dem spending cuts, that's all it would be worth.</p> <p>Hayter says there isn't time for any more questions. That's it.</p>",
  "<p>Twenty Labour MPs today sent a letter to all their parliamentary colleagues urging them to \"stand up and be counted\" by joining a loyalist campaign launched by former deputy prime minister John Prescott to secure a fourth term in power for the party.</p> <p>The signatories come from all sides of the party, and include prominent backbencher Jon Cruddas - seen by some as a possible future leftwing candidate for the leadership following his well-regarded campaign for deputy leader last year.</p> <p>Tellingly, also signing was Regent's Park and North Kensington MP Karen Buck, one of 12 Labour MPs who signed last week's letter to Progress magazine calling for a \"convincing new narrative\" for Labour which was widely seen as a challenge to Gordon Brown.</p> <p>Today's letter follows a magazine article launching the campaign by Prescott, Alastair Campbell, MEP Glenys Kinnock and former minister Richard Caborn. </p> <p>A website at <a href=\"http://www.gofourth.co.uk\">www.gofourth.co.uk</a> is being set up to support the campaign.</p> <p>The 20 signatories warned that internal party divisions will \"serve the interests of the Tories\", in what will be seen as a rebuke to the dozen Labour MPs who last week asked for nomination papers to be sent out for a leadership contest.</p> <p>The letter said: \"Our purpose in writing to Labour MPs is to build on the momentum for the Campaign for a Labour Fourth Term and demonstrate that our party is serious about remaining a party of government, pledged to tackle the massive global economic challenges that we face and to push forward the Labour agenda of fairness, equality and social justice.</p> <p>\"Internal divisions will only serve the interests of the Tories who cannot be allowed to achieve power by default. Now is the time to stand up and to be counted.\"</p> <p>Caborn said: \"This is a fantastic response from our colleagues and highlights the remarkable support we've been receiving from members across the country.</p> <p>\"From today, people can now register their support for our campaign ahead of our official launch in a few weeks time by logging onto www.gofourth.co.uk.

  "<p>With the huge events happening in the financial markets and global economy, this year's conference season is, quite rightly, receiving much less attention than usual.</p> <p>It doesn't mean that what's going on at the conferences isn't of political significance.

(The extra income tax break announced as compensation for the abolition of the 10p tax rate comes into effect this month, giving all income tax payers money back.) </p> <p>However, I think the notion put forward by the Lib Dems that you could achieve \u00a320bn tax cuts without impacting on the quality of frontline public services is naive to say the least. Their costed savings amount to the abolition of child trust funds and \"a department or two\" \u2013 far short of the savings they need to make. </p> <p>What's more, to make such a commitment now without the benefit of foresight of what may become of the economy is highly irresponsible. It seems probable, if not certain, that the problems in the financial markets will spill over to the \"real economy\" much more than previously predicted. As tax revenues fall there will be a significant strain on the government purse. Not then the ideal climate to be committing to uncosted tax cuts.</p> <p>What's also interesting, is that this New Lib Dem strategy is aimed at winning more Labour seats at the next election, not Tory ones. I'm not sure if I'm missing something here, but this seems very much like an Old Tory policy not a Labour one. I would imagine that my constituency, Manchester Withington, currently held with a Lib Dem majority of 600-odd, is one of their top 50 target seats \u2013 which were targeted with 250,000 unsolicited phone calls this week.<br> Again, maybe I'm speaking to different people than the Lib Dems, but many of the voters who switched from Labour to the Lib Dems in this seat last time are public sector workers. I don't detect a huge appetite from them for a \"shrinking\" of public services.</p> <p>The other notable feature of Lib Dems is that they appear to be all fluffy and nice, but when you're up against them campaigning unfortunately you see a rather less attractive side. So, I wasn't surprised to hear Nick Clegg in his conference speech lambasting the Labour government for introducing microchips in bins when the scheme was actually first introduced by Lib Dem-run <a href=\"http://www.kingston.gov.uk/de/browse/environment/rubbish_waste_and_recycling/recycling_initiatives/berrylands_trial.htm\">Kingston council</a>. </p> <p>It's a common tactic used in campaigns locally too.</p> <p>So to the Labour party conference, which begins this Saturday very close to my constituency in Manchester. For me, this should be an opportunity to showcase Labour in Manchester, what we have delivered and what we're doing to improve fairness and opportunity for people in my area. </p> <p>Let's hope the week doesn't get overshadowed by internal debates. More on this next week.</p>",

This is always my favourite moment of my favourite sporting event; each side has shown their colours, but there are enough points left to be won that no conclusions can be drawn yet. </p> <p>At the moment, the momentum is firmly with the US, after they twice overcame strong starts from their opponents to win the opening session for the first time since 1991 and lead the opening day for the first time since 1995. They are thriving on their underdog status and yesterday's play was characterised by determined performances from the hosts and partisan whooping and hollering from a fired-up crowd. <strong>This is going to be great.</strong> </p> <p>So the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/20/rydercup.golf3\">big news </a>is that Europe captain Nick Faldo has omitted <strong>Sergio Garcia</strong> and <strong>Lee Westwood</strong> from the foursomes line-up. </p> <p>That's Sergio Garcia, vastly experienced and wildly enthusiastic Ryder Cup player, three times a winner and with a record of W8 D1 L0 in the foursomes. And Lee Westwood, another totemic player with bags of experience in this tournament and the joint record-holder for most successive Ryder Cup games without defeat. That's a record he shares with Arnold Palmer.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>12.05pm BST Three reasons for Europe to be worried</strong><br><strong>Phil Mickelson is owning it</strong> In the absence of the Other Guy, Lefty has been playing out of his skin so far and is easily the Americans' strongest players so far. Twice he battled with Padraig Harrington yesterday and both times he clawed back deficits to end with 1 1/2 points to the Irishman's 1/2. His putting in particular was superb. with a 70-footer on the 12th perhaps the shot of the day. No European will look forward to taking him on today. Least of all rookie Oliver Wilson.</p> <p><strong>It's all a conspiracy</strong> The alickadoos of the European PGA Tour, concerned that continued tonkings would make the Americans take their golf ball and stalk off home in a huff, have met in the smoking room of a leading Parisian hotel (the USPGA meet in underground car parks) to cunningly engineer defeat for their own boys. Concerned that the American would just stop turning up for the Ryder Cup in order to focus on the shiny new President's Cup instead, the Europeans have chucked out Monty and Darren Clarke and appointed Faldo, a man who can't even get a lunch order in without making himself look stupid.</p> <p><strong>They are not winning</strong> In the Ryder Cup, as in may sporting events, the team with the most points takes the trophy, the plaudits and the girls. Currently that team is not Europe. Over the past two decades, the Europeans have generally led over the first two days, excelling in the foursomes and the fourballs while the Americans bark at each other and snap their putters in frustration. The tie then comes down to how well Europe holds that lead in the singles. This time however, the US take a healthy lead into the second day.</p> <p><strong>One reason for Europe to be cheerful</strong><br>They only need a draw.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>12.15pm BST While you're waiting</strong> Find out what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/20/rydercup.golf1\">Richard Williams thinks of the whole schemozzle</a> and why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/20/rydercup.golf\">Lawrence Donegan is not warming to Boo Weekley. </a>Have a gander at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/19/rydercup.golf6\">Sean Ingle's morning session minute-by-minute</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/19/rydercup.golf7\">Scott Murray's equally minute-by-minute afternoon report</a> for every pitch, play and USA! of yesterday's play.</p> <p>And speaking of Murray, check out his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/18/rydercup.thejoyofsix\">top six Ryder Cup moments ever ever ever</a> and when you are finished, scroll to the comments and tell him why he couldn't be more wrong and that you expected better from the Guardian. Finish by asking him does he get paid for this tosh.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>12.35pm BST</strong> Half and hour to go. On Sky right now, one of Europe's most winningest Ryder Cup heroes ever, Tony Jacklin, is bemoaning the raucous cheering of the American galleries. Unsurprisingly, really.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>12.40pm BST Prediction time </strong>I'm not contractually obliged to do this, so I am now unnecessarily risking making myself look foolish in the future. However, that has never stopped me in the past. I think Europe will make another strong start, except in the Mickelson/Kim v Wilson/Stenson match and then go on to hold that lead for a 2 1/2 to 1 1/2 session win.</p> <p>Having said that, expect Lefty to hurl his nine-iron into the galleries after five holes of stinking up the joint and Europe to slump to 5&amp;4 defeats in the other three matches.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>12.45pm BST</strong> <strong>In the interests of journalistic impartiality</strong>, I should disclose that I am, in fact, a <strong>European</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12.46pm BST</strong> <em>taps watch impatiently</em> Where is Naylor?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>12.48pm BST</strong> Ah, here we are. And conveniently he is addressing a topic to which I was about to turn my attention.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of hand-wringing over Boo Weekley geeing up the crowd. I find this a bit rich really. Golfers are (correctly) lauded for playing their game very close to, sometimes from within, the spectators, always able to concentrate on the matter at hand. Once the golfer is into his preparation, the crowd must desist from cheering, but until then, the crowd should be free to do what they want short of personal abuse even if the hole isn't yet decided. That's the dynamic of team sport crowd behaviour - the best players turn it to their advantage, home or away.\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>12.50pm BST Newsflash</strong> Padraig Harrington has an international award for Irish dancing. And Robert Karlsson is not particularly interesting.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12.52pm BST</strong> Boo Weekley and Paul Azinger have taken the most flak for geeing up the crowd, Weekley in particular for doing so before his opponent Lee Westwood had taken his shot. </p> <p>I mean, really. This is <em>America</em>. What did you expect? Rattle your jewellery?</p> <p>Here's Lee Westwood on Boo Weekley (who incidentally is named after Boo-Boo the bear). \"You walk a fine line when you use the crowd to your advantage that way. You can do it by playing good golf, but you can go too far when you are waving your arms around. At the 13th hole I still had a putt for a half \u2013 there's no need to do it between shots, at least wait until you're walking off the green, I don't mind that. The game was slow enough as it was. I thought we were never going to get finished.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1.05pm BST \"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the second day's morning matches of the 37th Ryder Cup.\"</strong> It's Ian 'Teacher's Pet' Poulter and his good buddy Justin Rose who will tee it up first for Europe and the dastardly colonials in their way are Stewart Cink and Chad Campbell.</p> <p>Today's action will be inevitably be viewed with the omission of Garcia and Westwood in the back of everyone's minds. Way to make yourself inconspicuous, Nick.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>1.06pm BST</strong> Rose tees up. No pressure.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1.06pm BST</strong> Rose lamps it down the fairway. Fantastic shot. Campbell follows suit but is unlucky to see it just nestle off the verge of the fairway.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1.10pm BST </strong>Sigh. Commercial break. To be fair to Sky, it is just two preposterously dressed young men walking through a manicured lawn. </p> <p>Gary Naylor, fashionista. \"It's almost impossible to believe with <a href=\"http://www.virginmedia.com/images/lehman.jpg\">form</a> like thisbut the American team is dressed soberly, even tastefully, whereas the Europeans appear to have come directly from an ice-cream salesmen's conference.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>1.13pm BST</strong> Poulter is 113yds from the pin, on a still morning. Spectacular! He plants it right up there and it so nearly goes in. He's within two feet and gets the concession.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>1.14pm BST </strong>Campbell has a holeable, but very difficult, shot for the half from just above the green and he does pretty well too, but it's first blood to Poulter and Rose.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>1.16pm BST</strong> It's Justin Leonard and Hunter Mahan against Miguel Angel Jimenez and Graeme McDowell on the first tee box now. Never mind Yankee razzmatazz, there is a sizeable contingent of Irish fans there who are easily more boisterous than anyone else. I know they are Irish because they are singing \"You'll never beat the Irish\" and wearing those ridiculous leprechaun outfits. Oh, lads.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>1.19pm BST</strong> Poulter leaves an excellent drive just right off the fairway, which Cink cannot match. He leaves it somewhere in the next state. That's filth. Ouch. According to Sky's man on the course that is \"the one place you must not go.\" Good chance for the English pair to go two up.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1.21pm BST</strong> Leonard's opening drive bounces high off the fairway, over the ropes and .... aaargh. Jimenez is in much better shape. Go team!</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>1.24pm BST</strong> Campbell is now onto his third shot, the Americans having taken a water hazard. He does well, but not nearly well enough given the position of Poulter and Rose.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>1.30pm BST</strong>Justin Rose lifts it high and clean to within two or three feet of the green. In the other game Jimenez is on the dancefloor, with a reasonably challenging putt of 10ft or so.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>1.32pm BST</strong> McDowell now to put Europe up in the second match. Oh, so close! Great start from him and Jimenez. In the top match, Poulter and Rose can two putt to win the hole.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>1.33pm BST </strong>Poulter's line is perfect but he is just short. The Amricans get up and down for a half in the other match, so that's all square.</p> <p>Campbell misses his 10 foot putt and gives Rose the gimme. It's<strong> two from two</strong> for Europe.</p> <p>Early scoreboard:<br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 2UP</strong> (2)<br>Leonard/Mahan A/S v Jimenez/McDowell (1)<br>Mickelson/Kim v Stenson/Wilson (1.35pm)<br>Furyk/Perry v Harrington/Karlsson (1.50pm)</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>1.35pm BST </strong>Oliver Wilson strikes his first Ryder Cup shot. And it's a good 'un. A bit too wide perhaps. He's playing with Henrik Stenson against Phil Mickelson and Anthony Kim. Lefty is spot on from the tee. Huge cheers, fist pumps, USA! USA!, etc.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>1.42pm BST </strong>Poulter from the bunker on the third green, slides it just past the hole. The US boys are in a good spot for a birdie though.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>1.44pm BST</strong> Cink misses his birdie putt and Rose gets his for par. All square at the third and that was a good escape from Europe to hold their lead. Mickelson is putting from 12ft or so with Europe sitting 4ft closer. He misses, just.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>1.46pm BST </strong>More calls of \"You'll never beat the Irish\" as Harrington and Karlsson approach the first tee, with Jim Furyk and Kenny Perry in tow. And Wilson so very nearly gets the birdie on his very first Ryder Cup hole. He doesn't, and neither does Mickelson, so no change there.</p> <p>McDowell, meanwhile leaves Jimenez a very gettable six foot putt - and he gets it. The US should make par though, and they do. Still all square.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>1.49pm BST </strong><br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 2UP</strong> (3)<br>Leonard/Mahan A/S v Jiminez/McDowell (2)<br>Mickelson/Kim A/S Stenson/Wilson (1)<br>Furyk/Perry v Harrington/Karlsson (1.50pm)</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>1.51pm BST </strong> Harrington cannot match his colleagues' efforts. It's in the trees and all over the place. Dagger eyes from Karlsson as he trudges into the crowd. In a curiously stubborn move, Furyk reckons anything Harrington can do he can do better, and smacks it into the galleries.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>1.54pm BST </strong>Cink sits over a right little doozy on the fourth. His lie looks to be sloping down and left. Poulter has a much easier one to follow. And Cink can't quite make it; it's long and wide. Karlsson is lost in the woods.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>1.54pm BST </strong><br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 3UP</strong> (4)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jiminez/McDowell 1UP</strong> (3)<br>Mickelson/Kim A/S v Stenson/Wilson (1)<br>Furyk/Perry v Harrington/Karlsson (1.50pm)</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>2.01pm BST</strong><strong> Europe leading in two matches</strong></p> <p>After Cink's miss, Poulter sinks his easily to go three up, and surely Faldo cannot suppress a smug smile at this stage. And right behind them Leonard hits a super chip that sneaks in the back but it's <strong>all in vain </strong>as they have already taken a drop and Europe can two-putt for the win. Jimenez needs them both but the second one is inches away conceded.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>2.06pm BST</strong> Drat! Karlsson couldn't make good on Harrington's wayward drive, leaving it right. Harrington in turn gives him a long straight put to save the half, but he can't make it. <strong>So the US take a lead in a match for the first time today. </strong></p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>2.07pm BST</strong> It's a mixture of poor play from Cink and Campbell and storming efficiency from Rose and Poulter, but the latter are now four up. Again, it was the approach shot that let the Americans down.</p> <p>But alas, Mickelson amd Kim are in equally fine form and they are now two up. It's a super putt from Kim on the third that his opponents have no reply to, after Stenson had given Wilson way too much to do on the previous hole.</p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 4UP</strong> (5)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jiminez/McDowell 2UP</strong> (4)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 2UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (3)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 1UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (1)</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>2.14pm BST </strong>Back in the bottom pairing and Karlsson outdrives Perry, both landing square in the middle of the fairway. But the advantage swings back to the US; Furyk takes the wedge for the lofted green and draws the necessary hollers from the crowd before Padraig \"three out of the last six majors\" Harrington leaves his edge shot much too short. Silence from the galleries. Harrington has not so far matched his superb play from yesterday, but it's still early.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>2.17pmBST </strong><strong> Controversy from Naylor </strong> \"Does Kentucky sanction gay marriages?\" I couldn't say, Gary, but I imagine very much no. \"The way the commentators are going on, we can expect Mickelson and Kim to make an announcement any day now.\"</p> <p>And he;s right, they are easily the smiliest pair out there, playing smooth, intuitive golf that only Poulter and Rose can come close to matching. At this stage, it looks like the day will be decided in the other pairings.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>2.21pm BST</strong> Oh dear. Perry holes a real dribbler, with the crowd blowing it in. That's two up for them and I imagine more dagger eyes for Harrington after he left his partner with a lot to do for the putt.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>2.22pm BST </strong>It's that man Kim again with a birdie putt. You know the drill; perfect lie, perfect putt, fist pump, chanting. He and Mickelson go three up. There are a lot of comparisons made between Kim's putting and Woods' and I have to say it's not too ridiculous a claim. He and Lefty really do look like they are out for a stroll on Captain's Day.</p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 4UP</strong> (5)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 2UP</strong> (4)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 3UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (4)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 2UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (2)</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>2.26pm </strong>McDowell is in trouble, but not terribly so. It's over the brook and onto a sharply sloping green at the fifth. He gets the distance and leaves it just off the green. That'll be par at best for Europe.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>2.30pm BST</strong>Harrington and Karlsson get a let-off at the third. They have a similar lie and Karlsson goes first, making an absolute hash of it. But even with the advantage of watching the Swede's lie, Perry drills it down and wide. Still two up for the USA. </p> <p>And there's a kerplunk! up ahead. Cink and Campbell in trouble.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>2.33pm BST </strong>Harrington with the lob wedge from the sand, about 92yds. Very difficult shot after a duff drive from Karlsson. He gets the spin on the back of the green but really these guys need to get it together, and quickly.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>2.35pm BST </strong>That was Cink who found the water (again) and that will surely be five down. Given his opponent's position, Poulter takes no chances and he lifts it to the back of the green, in light rough.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>2.37pm BST </strong>McDowell <em>just </em> misses that par on the fifth. It was a difficult ask from about ten feet and he rolls it around the cup.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>2.42pm BST </strong>Perry makes up for that stinker on the last green with a lovely putt that send the crowd crazy. He needed that after some poor work on the greens all day.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Leonard has taken advantage of McDowell's miss to take par and the hole. In the space of a minute it's two holes to the US and the crowd can scent blood. </p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 4UP</strong> (6)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 2UP</strong> (6)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 3UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (5)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 3UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (4)</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2.43pm BST </strong>Thankfully for Faldo's men, Cink and Campbell are still shambling about and after six wayward hacks they concede the hole. If the European captain was hoping for his poster boys Rose and Poulter to lead the way for Europe, then they have delivered in spades. <strong>They are five up through seven.</strong></p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>2.43pm BST </strong>Wilson is down in sloping rough on the sixth but he must be confident of his lie because he simply lamps it up and over across the fairway, from where it rolls back down into a reasonably good position. For Stenson and Wilson though it really does look like damage limitation though, given Mickelson and Kim's brilliance.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>2.47pm BST</strong>Oh, Padraig! I can hardly look. Another poor drive, and he really is way off the pace compared to yesterday. And given that he only managed a half point yesterday, that really is bad news. It's Karlsson from the bunker and he stabs it up to the fairway, sort of. Best he could do with a horrible lie.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>2.50pm BST</strong> A scrambling half for Cink and they remain five down. But Wilson misses a relatively simple putt at the seventh and that would have been such a confidence booster for the rookie. That would have been for a half, so they are now four down. </p> <p>In an unsurprising turn of events, Karlsson and Harrington have lost another hole, and yet again that was the Irishman's fault. </p> <p>And this is where we're at:<br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 5UP</strong> (8)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 1UP</strong> (6)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 4UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (6)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 4UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (5)</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>2.54pm BST</strong> Rose finds the rough from the eighth tee, but it's a gentle kind of rough and Poulter won't sweat it too much. These guys look like they want to be home and hosed by the 12th or 13th. </p> <p>Jimenez is unlucky there, a fine sweeping putt around to the right. That would have won the hole - but what's this! Calamity from Mahan and the US take a six. <strong>That's 2 up to Jimenez and McDowell in the only game really up for grabs right now. </strong></p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>3.00pm BST</strong> <strong>It's quite a different day from yesterday.</strong> Each match, apart from perhaps the second, is looking won already and there hasn't been a sniff of a chance that any of the strugglers might swing the match back their way. In contrast yesterday saw the lead change hands several times. </p> <p>Naylor has just sent me a simply dreadful smutty pun that I will be forced to print unless i get an e-mail from someone else. <strong>Believe me, it's in your interest.</strong></p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>3.04pm BST</strong> Leonard has a putt to win the hole and take their match with McDowell and Jimenez back to one down. He dinks it home oh-so-slowly, surely toying with his opponents and the crowd. The US are winning this hands down on the greens. And on the fairway. And from the rough, etc and so on.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>3.08pm BST</strong> Oh, hooray! Big PH (as I once heard a particularly obnoxious Portmarnock clubman refer to Harrington, as if he had known him since their pitch and putt days) has holed and Furyk has not. <strong>That's back to 3 up for Furyk and Perry.</strong></p> <p>If Europe are to start clawing back the Americans' lead, they <em>must</em> win this match. Wilson and Stenson have far too much to do. Karlsson had had a respectable season and Harrington is Europe's most highly-ranked player. And their only major winner.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>3.14pm BST </strong>McDowell hits a poor approach to the wrong side of the green, and Jimenez will do well to leave his partner a simple putt, let alone hole it himself.</p> <p>My successful attempt to jinx Kim and Mickelson has worked, they are in trouble on the eighth. And Perry is in the water! It's all kicking off. If indeed golf ever does 'kick off'.</p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 5UP</strong> (9)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 1UP</strong> (7)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 3UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (6)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 3UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (6)</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>3.17pm BST</strong> It's Harrington now, going across the water that Perry couldn't clear. He needs to get it high and right. He lays up, but Karlsson will take their third from roughly the same spot that Furyk will hit the American's sixth. Furyk does well; the putt for five is definitely on.</p> <p>All square at the ninth for McDowell/Jimenez and Leonard/Mahan. They reach the turn with Europe one up.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>3.21pm BST</strong> Cink and Campbell were 39 out; four over and no birdies. Yikes.</p> <p>Karlsson and Harrington continue to play safe, Harrington is about 65 yards away and will need the lob wedge to clear the front edge.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>3.22pm BST</strong> <strong>Quick dash over to Wilson and Stenson.</strong> Following my needless pontification at 3.08pm, the American pair have seen their lead slashed to two holes. Europe took the seventh when Kim found himself deep in rough and couldn't find a way out, and Mickelson's poor salvage effort from a bunker at the eighth gave Kim a tough 15ft putt that he rolled wide. <br><strong><br>And behind them it's more good news for Europe.</strong> Furyk gives Perry a chance from about 12ft, which he takes in smashing fashion. He couldn't buy a putt earlier. But it's a wasted effort, Karlsson holes to cut it back to two holes between them.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>3.30pm BST</strong> Laurence Slater is not entirely impressed with the European front pair's performance. </p> <p>\"In the midst of the carnage in the first group it seems to me that Justin Rose has actually played quite badly. This is being masked because Cink and Campbell have played particularly badly and Poulter has played really well.\" </p> <p>Well?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>3.33pm BST </strong>That is the nature of foursomes though; you can carry your partner or drag him down into the stinking mire with you. Poulter and Rose benefit from being close friends and perhaps Rose also benefits from Poulter being a more flamboyant character, taking the limelight his direction. He certainly has prospered from the fact that his opponents are playing absolute gack.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>3.36pm BST </strong>Of course, we only have their word that they are good friends. For all we know Poulter could drag Rose back to the locker rooms afterwards to administer a series of Chinese burns.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>3.39pm BST</strong> Whatever the truth, they have just lost the last hole - their first setback of the day - and whatever the result, Ian Poulter will surely brook no more criticism of his selection after a commanding performance today. </p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 4UP</strong> (11)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 1UP</strong> (10)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 2UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (9)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 2UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (7)</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>3.41pm BST </strong><strong>The last half hour or so have definitely belonged to the boys in baby blue.</strong> Stenson and Wilcon reach the turn two down after looking like lost children for much of the front nine. McDowell and Jimenez have constantly flirted with skipping back to all square but Harrington and Karlsson look much more comfortable now.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>3.46pm BST </strong>Jimenez putts from off the green to win the hole but can't quite make it. They halve the 11th. </p> <p>Up ahead, Poulter hits an extremely difficulty chip shot blind to abut eight feet past the pin. Chance of a par.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>3.38pm BST </strong>It's Cink now on the 12th green, with the chance of hauling Rose and Poulter back further. It's up and left and he can't make it. Rose still has a lot to do to halve the hole and give Laurence Slater one in the eye. He misses and now Cink and Campbell are back to three down. Time for Rose and Poulter to settle and close this one out.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>3.53pm BST </strong>A ping in the inbox and it's Chris Colman. \"I don't watch a lot of golf but why doesn't anyone create a putter with a spirit level incorporated into the base?\"</p> <p>Get on to Dyson.

He finds the long stuff out behind the left of the pin, but it's not too bad for Rose and given his nasty lie Poulter will be reasonably happy.</p> <p>McDowell and Jimenez will not be though; they're back to all square. The Spaniard could only skid it back into through from a deep, deep bunker lie and McDowell can do better. They concede the hole and their lead.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>4.02pm BST</strong> If indeed Poulter and Rose do collapse - and a missed putt from Poulter at the 13th <strong>means they are now just two up </strong> it would be the first time a five-hole lead has been squandered in the Ryder Cup.

That really is a shame; but to be fair the European pair are only in this position because Mickelson and Kim have been putting on their best Laurel and Hardy impression. All they are missing is a rake and a precariously positioned pot of white paint. </p> <p>If Wilson and Stenson want this they need to up their game in response to the Americans' collapse.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>4.25pm BST </strong>Poulter is back in the zone now after his screaming fit on the 14th.

He must have been a <em>little bit</em> taken aback, though.</p> <p>Word from the curse is that <strong>Garcia was feeling a little bit poorly today.</strong></p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>4.40pm BST </strong>While all that was going on, Miguel Angel Jimenez has been a busy man. He sprayed it off the 14th, missed the subsequent putt, gone back to all square and then set McDowell up beautifully on the 15th for a chance to regain the initiative.

It is on the green though. </p> <p>Lefty, Lefty, Lefty. What are you doing? He's hacked his drive on the 14th way, while Henrik Stenson has taken the more orthodox route of absolutely <em>cracking</em> it down the fairway.

  "<p>As the world economy threatens meltdown, Alan Greenspan \u2013 who, as <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov\">chairman</a> of the Federal Reserve Bank,had presided over its fortunes from 1987 to 2006 \u2013 expressed himself as being taken aback by what he described as a once-in-a-century <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/14/greenspan-this-is-the-wor_n_126274.html\">crisis</a>. We were all invited, by implication, to join in his bewilderment at the apparently unheralded disaster that has suddenly struck us. If even Alan Greenspan had not seen it coming, we could all be excused for a similar failing, couldn't we?</p> <p>Well, no. This is a crisis that has been thirty years in the making. Its approaching outline has been visible for a very long time. Only those who did not want to see (and that includes almost all the so-called expert commentators and actors in the drama) could have failed to register the warning signs.</p> <p>The first little alarm bell might have rung when, at the end of the 1970s and early in the 1980s, much of the world \u2013 following the lead provided by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan \u2013 removed <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/1992/09/21/ebon_1.php\">exchange controls</a> and allowed capital to move freely around the world. The result was a huge increase in capital flows as multinational investors roamed the globe, looking for the most favourable long-term, and often short-term, investment opportunities.</p> <p>In one bound, the controllers of that capital had decisively changed the balance of power between capital and governments, whether elected or otherwise. It was now the international investors who could face down governments, threatening to move their investment elsewhere if they did not get their way. The capital flows they controlled were sufficient to dwarf the resources of all but the biggest national authorities. The political agenda had been transformed; the democratic process, which was supposed to protect ordinary people from the predations of capitalism, had been disabled.</p> <p>This is not, of course, how it was portrayed at the time. On the contrary, it was represented as a dismantling of unnecessary and damaging controls. The way was now clear to establish a single global market which, by definition, excluded governments, since any government intervention in that market would mean that market conditions would vary from one part of it to another and it would no longer be a single market.</p> <p>As the external environment changed, so too did domestic conditions. The fashion was now for monetarism \u2013 the mechanistic application of supposedly simple rules for controlling the money supply and therefore inflation \u2013 a process which could safely be entrusted to officials and market operations and removed from the unreliable attentions of democratically elected politicians.</p> <p>Again, these developments were almost universally applauded as an overdue expression of the \"free\" market, not least by those who \u2013 it might have been thought \u2013 would most resist them. Yet, even then, they were not satisfied that they had done enough to shunt off democratic processes to the margins. They determined to ensure that governments were definitively excluded from economic policy by proclaiming that there was only one goal of that policy \u2013 the control of inflation \u2013 and that that task should be removed from those elected to undertake it and handed over to an unaccountable central bank. The principal decisions in economic policy were thereby virtually insulated against public debate and discussion.</p> <p>This, too, was greeted enthusiastically around the world as an inspired piece of Solomon-like wisdom. And, as the inevitable consequences began to take shape, as those who now controlled huge financial assets worldwide and could manipulate them for their own benefit without any fear of interference began to cream off a higher and higher \"return\" and to pay themselves more and more outrageous salaries, bonuses, commissions, and \"perks\" of all kinds, while at the same time making decisions not only exclusively in their own interests but without regard for the consequences for millions of people around the world whose lives and livelihoods simply no longer mattered, the politicians of the day joined in the celebrations. Typical was the New Labour government, which, we were told, was \"intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich\".</p> <p>And, as the banks and financial institutions focused on making as much money as possible through manipulating assets and irresponsible lending, they could relax in the knowledge that the central bank was not only too busy with the task it had been given of shaping economic policy to bother about prudential regulation, but also that it would be too solicitous of the interests of its fellow banks to do anything about it anyway.</p> <p>So, the whole de-regulated international money-go-round whirled ever faster, the music played louder, the champagne flowed faster, and the world economy lurched from one crisis to another. But there was always another tranche of credit, or another clever idea for securitising debt, or another mega-merger, to keep the bubble floating.</p> <p>And then, in slow motion, the souffle began to collapse. As always, it is the victims of the excesses who now have to pay the biggest price for correcting them. It is all those who will lose their homes and their jobs and their living standards and their sense of self-worth who will bear the heaviest burden.</p> <p>In the meantime, poor Alan Greenspan! He couldn't see it coming. Nor could all those bankers, politicians, commentators, financial experts and multinational potentates who so enthusiastically drove it all forward and were so dazzled by their good fortune that they could not recognise reality.</p> <p>But some of us saw it coming. You bet we did.</p>"
