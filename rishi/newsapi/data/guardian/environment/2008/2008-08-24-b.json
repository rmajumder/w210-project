  "<p>There have always been companies that have considered themselves to be above advertising - and some that have made a big deal out of the fact that they \"don't do\" advertising. One such brand is The Body Shop. Dismissed by some as a hangover from its hippy roots, The Body Shop has never really had to bother with advertising: seen as unique and ethical, and with founder Anita Roddick as its spokeswoman, it could rely on word of mouth to drive consumers to its stores. </p> <p>But the \u00a3652m sale of The Body Shop to L'Or\u00e9al in 2006 marked a change in how the company was perceived. The two sit at opposite ends of the ethical spectrum: L'Or\u00e9al continues to test its products on animals; The Body Shop never has. L'Or\u00e9al has a scientific approach to its business; The Body Shop had always gone the natural route. The sale caused widespread confusion and outrage among loyalists. </p> <p>The Body Shop has not done anything dramatic to counteract consumer puzzlement over the direction of the brand - until now. This week will see it launch its first global advertising campaign - created by Leagas Delaney - in order to re-emphasise the company's core values. The \"Nature's way to beautiful\" campaign carries details of the shop chain's manifesto with lines such as \"In business we play fair\" and \"Less packaging, more beautiful\". L'Or\u00e9al spends about \u00a370m a year on advertising - most notably its \"You're worth it\" campaign - but the same luxury has not been gifted to The Body Shop. This will be mostly a glossy press campaign, with online and direct marketing. The bulk of The Body Shop's message will still be carried in its stores. For now.</p> <p>But the beauty retailer is not the only brand that declined to advertise and then changed its mind. Pizza Express used to say it didn't \"need\" to advertise. Its strategy was attention to detail, consistency of product, quality of service and word of mouth. When it did launch an ad campaign, following the drop in tourism after September 11, it emphasised the word-of-mouth ethos with posters featuring people in fashions from the 60s onwards. The strapline was: \"Pizza Express - word of mouth since 1965.\"</p> <p>After testing in various regions, Pizza Express discovered that there was no spectacular uptake where the ad ran (although I can't help wondering if that had something to do with the ads themselves). Advertising was an experiment the chain declined to repeat. </p> <p>And then there are the brands that dabble, visiting advertising very rarely. Despite being founded by a former adman - Richard Reed - Innocent has never been a big advertiser. Sometimes it hires an agency (in fact it's currently looking for one), and it occasionally runs something on TV. I don't know why it bothers. Surely a brand like that can almost solely rely on consumer desire and the lack of a really good competitor?</p> <p>But, as with The Body Shop, everyone gives in in the end, it seems. Dyson, Next and H\u00e4agen-Dazs have all, over the past 20 years, shied away from advertising only to succumb. Marks &amp; Spencer hardly used advertising, yet now you can't imagine life without Twiggy, Myleene and Erin. It turned to advertising when millions were wiped off its profits. </p> <p>Pret a Manger still holds out, but given the rising costs of ingredients, most particularly wheat and oil, and the reluctance of credit-crunch-hit consumers to dig deep for lunch money, the sandwich chain may find itself forced to convince people that it is worth paying for. One hundred and fifty shops and a small profit base - surely it can't hold out indefinitely. Word of mouth won't work forever guys.</p> <p>\u00b7 Lucy Barrett is the editor of Marketing</p>",
  "<p>It was the TV festival equivalent of an all-singing, all-dancing Saturday-night shiny floor show. The feelgood vibes rolled across the packed, hard wooden pews of Edinburgh's McEwan Hall as Peter Fincham delivered one of the best-received MacTaggart speeches of recent years. The industry may not have been breaking open the bubbly, but the atmosphere in the packed hall was closer to a party than it has been after the sermons of recent years.</p> <p>The morning after, the hangovers kicked in. The ITV director of television's address was a rousing celebration of all that was good about British telly - but he had refused to grapple with the detail of how his vision for a popular, strong, diverse ITV would actually be delivered. The closer you looked, the more holes appeared in his argument - 24 hours later, there seemed a growing disconnect between Fincham's elegantly expressed vision and the sense that huge, unanswered problems continue to stalk ITV.</p> <p>Fincham painted an optimistic picture of free-to-air, mass-market television's future if only regulatory help was forthcoming to help ITV get there. But in reality the double whammy of structural change and what Channel 4's chairman, Luke Johnson, said was the worst year for the British economy in 20 years leave it in a desperately exposed state. ITV's dismal recent results - revealing that ad revenues for next month are down by a fifth year on year, as its share price continues to hit new lows - exposed the scale of the problem. </p> <p>Fincham's pitch was similar to that delivered by his boss, Michael Grade, albeit more entertaining. Indeed, in Edinburgh it was left to other ITV execs - such as Grade's blunt commercial chief, Rupert Howell - to add some detail. In essence, ITV wants to retain the privileges of being a public service broadcaster - being No 3 on the remote control, for a start - while divesting itself of many of its historic obligations, including commitments to regional news and current affairs. </p> <p><strong>Besuited wonks</strong></p> <p>Fincham described a British-owned broadcaster delivering everything from news to arts, with \u00a31m-an-hour drama at its heart. In return for maintaining its investment in programmes at around its current level, ITV should be handed a far less restrictive settlement. Such a channel deserves celebrating, he argued, rather than castigating. </p> <p>Like all great entertainers, Fincham played to the gallery. His caricature of regulators as wordy, besuited wonks who rarely spend Saturday nights slumped in front of The X Factor was warmly embraced by an audience of programme-makers who increasingly resent what they perceive as a snobbish distrust of popular television among the political and regulatory classes.</p> <p>\"Television needs regulators, just as roads need traffic wardens. But you wouldn't ask your traffic warden to give you advice on what sort of car to buy, still less how to drive it,\" Fincham said to laughter. Criticising the regulator in front of broadcasters is rather like a comedian telling jokes about Liverpool fans in a Manchester pub.</p> <p>Ofcom insiders were bemused by the attack. They felt Fincham quoted selectively from the report. Indeed, in much of its recent output, Ofcom has already bought into ITV's argument that the new digital landscape made its historic public service commitments impossible to maintain. The \"storyline\" document leaked to MediaGuardian last month suggests that the regulator will give ITV significant leeway in the second phase of its public service broadcasting review next month. Ofcom has confirmed that the value of ITV's public service licence will decline from \u00a3280m to \u00a345m by 2012 and that it was minded to reduce ITV's commitments as digital switchover neared.</p> <p>Tim Gardam, the former Channel 4 director of programmes who is now an Ofcom director, refused to be drawn into a slanging match on an Edinburgh podium. He even said that Fincham was simply echoing Ofcom's position, though in slightly different language, and suggested that if Fincham had \"read half a centimetre further along\" the ITV executive would have found much common ground. Gardam echoed many in the industry when he said: \"But what exactly is he [Fincham] asking Ofcom to do?\"</p> <p>In his speech, Fincham channelled the spirit of Lew Grade and Sidney Bernstein, the great showmen of ITV's past, and in that he succeeded. \"He gave a beautiful, amusingly delivered speech, as you would expect. Just slightly short of substance,\" said Charles Brand, director of specialist factual at Tiger Aspect. Mark Wood, the ITN chief executive, called it \"uplifting\", while pointing out the hard reality that ITV is restructuring its regional newsgathering network in a bid to slash \u00a340m from its budget this autumn. </p> <p><strong>Grimmer picture</strong></p> <p>In other vulnerable areas too, particularly children's programming, the evidence onscreen suggests a much grimmer picture than that suggested by Fincham. John Whittingdale, the Tory MP who chairs the media select committee, said: \"I do accept ITV is facing significant economic pressure. But Ofcom doesn't need to talk about entertainment because there is no requirement for government intervention to get Britain's Got Talent on to our screens. There is a serious problem in children's television and regional news, which ITV exemplifies because it's pulling out of them left, right and centre.\"</p> <p>Despite Fincham's championing of creativity, there is a genuine sense of frustration within the walls of ITV's Grays Inn Road HQ that onscreen improvements seem to be making little impact. Added to the gloom, efficiency savings have reached the engine room of the advertising sales staff, and the marketing and PR operations have been severely cut. ITV executives point to efficiencies, stabilised viewing figures and a slight uplift in the number of people watching ads. Now they want policy-makers and regulators to offer a helping hand. </p> <p>Melvyn Bragg, the doyen of ITV programme-makers, picked up the baton from Fincham: \"The old game is up, it's all over. We are chained to an ancient regime, which is unsustainable. The \u00a31bn in programming money - that's the prize ITV is fighting for. This is about the survival of the most adaptable, but we're in a straitjacket.\"</p> <p>ITV's list of demands includes reformation of the contract rights renewal system that pegs the rates it can charge for ads to pre-merger levels, which Howell claims would bring in an extra \u00a340m a year. It wants to be free to charge what it likes, in more slots, and enjoy the freedom to operate without any regulatory constraints. It also wants restrictions on how it spends its programme budget - those regulations that commit it to spending half of its money outside London and restrict its rights negotiations with independent producers - swept away. But David Liddiment, the former ITV director of programmes who is now a BBC Trustee, accused Fincham of \"tilting at windmills\". \"I don't see any evidence of Ofcom trying to turn ITV into Radio 4,\" he added. </p> <p>Even Fincham welcomed the fact that ITV was in the \"centre of the conversation\" this year, at a time when the whole industry is having to come to terms with the realities of the fragmented media landscape. The Channel 4 chief executive, Andy Duncan, summed it up when he said: \"The changes are very profound. Television is not as important as it was in people's lives. There are global forces at work.\" </p> <p>ITV believes it has long been the industry \"whipping boy\", in Bragg's words. Yet what has hurt most over the past few years is that viewers are not tuning in in significantly mass-market numbers. For all Fincham's rousing words about the communal power of ITV hits such as The X Factor, Britain's Got Talent and Champions League football, he said rather less about some of its more disappointing fare. ITV1 hasn't had a new contemporary 9pm drama hit all year, for example, verging on self-parody with the tacky Rock Rivals and superficially glitzy Harley Street. It has also been a miserable summer for the network, almost visibly giving up in the face of the BBC's Olympics onslaught. Many believe that the schedule will improve this autumn. Yet such is the structural malaise in which ITV finds itself that even an improvement of its onscreen fortunes would not help in the short term.</p> <p>Fincham was also at a loss to explain what would happen if an overseas raider came and bought ITV. The current management team have promised to invest in a high-quality mixed schedule in return for fewer regulations, but a new management team may not share their view. </p> <p>As Fincham delivered his speech, the gathered executives felt the warming comfort of television's ability to hold mass audiences in its spell. The theme was \"I love TV\" and Fincham managed to put an \"I\" in front of the TV part. The assembled stars in Edinburgh and Fincham's speech had reminded them of television's peculiar power. As the feelgood factor visibly drained away amid hard questioning over the weekend, however, there was a tangible fear among broadcasters that events are on the verge of overtaking them as regulatory reform continues at a glacial pace and the media landscape is redrawn. </p> <p>ITV will get an answer before the end of the year on its regional plans, but decisions on the future funding of public service broadcasting and the other changes it is lobbying for are likely to take much longer. Duncan's rallying call for broadcasters to stop bickering and lobby government for urgent help looks likely to fall on deaf ears. And with any significant changes to the statute book unlikely to be on the agenda until after a general election, they know that time is running out.</p>",
  "<p>It took Jimmy Page and David Beckham just eight minutes to set the tone for London 2012 last night, but four years of hard work and unremitting focus will be required to deliver on the vision of a contemporary, inclusive and human games that arrived in the Bird's Nest aboard a double-decker bus last night.</p> <p>The challenge facing London remains huge, not least because of the technically flawless event delivered by the Chinese, but no one who has spent any time in Beijing can fail to return immeasurably buoyed by the success of the British team and the opportunity that now stands before London.</p> <p>Olympic games usually arrive in the national consciousness like a circus reaching town, a splendid temporary diversion from the everyday that is quickly forgotten once the caravan has moved on. </p> <p>This time it will be different. The success of British athletes in Beijing has provided the perfect boost to Lord Coe and his team as they enter a critical time in delivering the largest peace-time project any city can undertake. </p> <p>Three years after London's Olympic honeymoon was cut short when the 7/7 suicide bombers attacked the transport system within 24 hours of the city being awarded the games, Rebecca Adlington, Chris Hoy, Louis Smith and the rest of the medallists have brought renewed optimism to the project. After three years during which the hugely misleading original budget became a self-inflicted wound that sapped public confidence, London may once again enjoy the benefit of the doubt.</p> <p>What is beyond doubt is the scale of the challenge that lies ahead. From the athletes' village to the stadiums, the media facilities to the technology, Beijing has set new standards. Matching them against the background of a credit crunch will test London's ingenuity and the government's nerve.</p> <p>Coe and Paul Deighton, chief executive of the organising committee, acknowledge this, and there is a reassuring air of confidence that the 2012 team can deliver. More than 100 organising committee staff have spent three weeks embedded with the Beijing organisers and their experience will be invaluable. If London can assimilate the huge attention to detail that has distinguished Beijing, the 2012 games will be better for it. </p> <p>But if the technical challenge is significant, the opportunity that lies before London and the UK is huge. The Olympics offer a once-in-a-generation chance to define the capital and the country for a global audience, and after China's show of strength London has a chance to make its own inimitable mark. </p> <p>At their best the games are a celebration, a global party sparked by the innocent delights of sporting endeavour. The athletic achievements may be wrapped in layers of protocol, patriotism and ceremony, but there is no mistaking the authenticity of the feats that lie at their heart.</p> <p>Thanks to the British athletes' exploits in Beijing, spectators will revel in the lunacy of Greco-Roman wrestling and BMX as much as they glory in the best of track and field, even more so if a Brit is involved. Britain invented and formalised the rules of many of the Olympic disciplines, and the athletes will compete before well-informed, appreciative crowds in four years' time.</p> <p>They should also find the sense of fun so obviously absent in Beijing. A city that flocks to outdoor screens for concerts and pubs for football matches, and which grew up on street parties will embrace the Olympic babel. In doing so it will be doing the Olympic movement a huge favour, going some way to remove the taint of the International Olympic Committee's obsequious attitude to China over the last seven years.</p> <p>The biggest winner, however, will be the UK. The Olympics give nations a chance to restate their place in the world and showcase the best of themselves. With London determined to stress the youthful, creative, culturally vibrant best of the capital there is every chance they will succeed.</p> <p>It will not be straightforward. Few politicians have been able to resist the reflected glory of the Olympics, and there are signs that the changing political weather is having an impact on London 2012. Several of the figures who delivered the games, including Tony Blair and Ken Livingstone, have left the stage, and with the Brown government apparently on borrowed time, the Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, may be next. </p> <p>With the London mayor, Boris Johnson, drifting off-message on transport plans and the legacy use of the stadium, Coe has a job on his hands to hold the centre.</p>",
  "<h2>Paul Kelso</h2> <br> <p><strong>Best moment</strong></p> <p>The Olympic spirit was most evident when the Italian Francesco D'Aniello secured silver in the men's double-trap. He celebrated like Marco Tardelli crossed with Costantino Rocca and is probably still crying now. Marvellous.</p> <p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong></p> <p>China's failure to match the technical achievement of the Games with a mature response to legitimate media inquiries, and the IOC's complicity in the evasion.</p> <p><strong>One to watch for 2012</strong></p> <p>The Jamaican sprint team. Very closely.</p> <p><strong>Best sportsman</strong></p> <p>In a Games without Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps Kenenise Bekele's achievement in retaining his 10,000m title and adding the 5,000m would have been the stand-out performance.</p> <p><strong>What London can learn from Beijing</strong></p> <p>Very little beyond the technicalities. No nation will ever bring money and political will to bear on the Olympics on this scale again; London should not try.</p> <p><strong>What London should not do</strong></p> <p>Keep ticketless fans away from the Olympic Park or allow sponsors to leave swaths of empty seats.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be dropped</strong></p> <p>Anything that involves a horse.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be added</strong></p> <p>More time in the athletics programme to give Usain Bolt a shot at the 400m.</p> <h2>Marina Hyde</h2> <br> <p><strong>Best moment</strong></p> <p>The 100m final. Electric atmosphere, and who could forget that run? You often hear athletes say they could not take in the stadium thrill because they were so focused on their race. Bolt appeared to focus so much on the stadium that he could well not have taken in his race. Tunnel vision is dead: welcome to stadio-vision.</p> <p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong></p> <p>Liu Xiang being forced to pull out of the 110m hurdles. A nation really did seem to mourn.</p> <p><strong>One to watch for 2012</strong></p> <p>David Beckham. Bags more to see from this unprepossessing chap, who has yet to reach his peak.

It's supposed to be a celebration, right?\"</p> <p><strong>One to watch for 2012</strong></p> <p>Alistair Brownlee. The Under-23 world champion from Leeds repeatedly attacked the world's best in the men's triathlon until fading late on.</p> <p><strong>Best sportsman</strong></p> <p>Michael Phelps. You try winning eight gold medals.</p> <p><strong>What London can learn from Beijing</strong></p> <p>It is possible to get traffic moving in a major city.</p> <p><strong>What London should not do</strong></p> <p>Be so scared of crowds assembling to enjoy the Games. Fanzones in Stratford and along The Mall please.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be dropped</strong></p> <p>Take your pick from shooting, taekwondo, synchronised swimming.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be added</strong></p> <p>Darts. If archery and shooting are Olympic sports, why not?</p> <h2>Robert Kitson</h2> <br> <p><strong>Best moment</strong></p> <p>Bolt and Phelps in the 100m and 100m butterfly respectively. Two once-in-a-lifetime performances inside 24 hours.</p> <p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong></p> <p>Let us just say Australia's final position in the medal table will provide rich material for months to come.</p> <p><strong>One to watch for 2012</strong></p> <p>Rebecca Adlington.

The best thing to come out of Jamaica since reggae and Michael Holding.</p> <p><strong>What London can learn from Beijing</strong></p> <p>Thousands of smiling, helpful volunteers did a wonderful job of deflecting attention away from China's less attractive aspects. If London is full of scowling jobsworths the 2012 Games will be doomed from the start.</p> <p><strong>What London should not do</strong></p> <p>Turn a blind eye to under-age gymnasts in a blinkered quest for gold at all costs.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be dropped</strong></p> <p>If the world's best individuals are not involved, the sport concerned should not be in the Games.

Can we not call it a dead heat and count ourselves privileged to have seen both?</p> <p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong></p> <p>Usain Bolt's decision to sprint for only 75 metres of the 100m final.</p> <p><strong>One to watch for 2012</strong></p> <p>Christine Ohuruogu is a controversial figure but it is time to move on. The born-and-bred Londoner is the personification of multicultural Britain. She should light the torch.</p> <p><strong>Best sportsman</strong></p> <p>The Aussie swimmer Grant Hackett. Denied a gold medal in the men's 1500m by a competitor who made it to Beijing only after his drugs ban was reduced, he had every right to be bitter. Instead Hackett was so gracious in defeat he made me cry.</p> <p><strong>What London can learn from Beijing</strong></p> <p>Different rules apply in a totalitarian state but London must get the little things right - infrastructure, ticketing, helpful volunteers. Keeping the restaurant and hotel prices reasonable would also be good, though probably asking too much.</p> <p><strong>What London should not do</strong></p> <p>We should open our doors to the world. The Olympics are about promoting sport, not the greater glory of the hosts.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be dropped</strong></p> <p>Beach volleyball. I always suspected it was a ridiculous sport but not until these Games did I learn the rules state there is a maximum size for the bikinis worn by the female players. A sport for the dirty old men Olympics, not the proper Olympics.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be added</strong></p> <p>An event involving the consumption of blueberry muffins from the media village cafe. It will allow me to fulfil my lifelong ambition of winning an Olympic gold medal.</p> <h2>William Fotheringham</h2> <br> <p><strong>Best moment</strong></p> <p>Emma Pooley's silver in the time-trial. Proof that you can still rock up and get on with it, without big sponsorship bucks and without life-long obsession. Hope for all who are not stars by 18.</p> <p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong></p> <p>Paula Radcliffe. Not in what she did but the fact that she was there at all. What was the point?</p> <p><strong>One to watch for 2012</strong></p> <p>Shanaze Reade, in the women's track sprint. And Victoria Pendleton in the road race.</p> <p><strong>Best sportsman</strong></p> <p>Chris Hoy. A star, a worker and an ambassador. And clean.</p> <p><strong>What London can learn from Beijing</strong></p> <p>Smiles and patience. Coherent transport planning for the Games.</p> <p><strong>What London should not do</strong></p> <p>Totally divorce the Games from the real life of the city.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be dropped</strong></p> <p>About 50% of the swimming. Too many events, with all respect to Phelps.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be added</strong></p> <p>Rugby. More global than many sports here and great post-event parties. The calendar might be an issue.</p> <h2>Steve Bierley</h2> <br> <p><strong>Best moment</strong></p> <p>Bolt's win in the 100m. The mind may have flashed back to Ben Johnson but this was the most astounding sprint.</p> <p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong></p> <p>The scheduling for the track and field. It never really seemed to build to the usual climax.</p> <p><strong>One to watch for 2012</strong></p> <p>Pippa Wilson. She is an outstanding sailor who is talented enough to go it alone for gold next time.</p> <p><strong>Best sportsmen and women</strong></p> <p>The whole of the British sailing team who supported one another throughout in difficult conditions.</p> <p><strong>What London can learn from Beijing</strong></p> <p>To get everything finished well ahead of time</p> <p><strong>What London should not do</strong></p> <p>Produce a plethora of dreadfully banal Olympic music.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be dropped</strong></p> <p>Where to begin ... men's football and all the tennis.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be added</strong></p> <p>The Tornado class (catamaran), the most exciting of the sailing classes that has been dropped for London.</p> <h2>Andy Bull</h2> <br> <p><strong>Best moment</strong></p> <p>The astonishingly emotional reaction of Matthias Steiner when he won gold in the men's +105kg weightlifting. His wife died in a car crash in 2007 and he carried a portrait of her on to the rostrum and kissed it.</p> <p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong></p> <p>The Murray brothers who, if they had wanted it more, could have been one of the most enjoyable British stories.</p> <p><strong>One to watch for 2012</strong></p> <p>The entire US team, who will spend four years plotting revenge on China in the medal table.</p> <p><strong>Best sportswoman</strong></p> <p>Natalie du Toit, who finished 16th in the women's 10km swim despite her left leg being amputated beneath the knee.</p> <p><strong>What London can learn from Beijing</strong></p> <p>The most important thing about the mood of the Games is how much the population of the host city enjoy it and in turn how welcome they make the visitors feel.</p> <p><strong>What London should not do</strong></p> <p>Knock down over half of the city centre to replace it with new build.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be dropped</strong></p> <p>None of them, the more the better.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be added</strong></p> <p>Rugby Sevens.

  "<p>A British-built spy plane has set an unofficial world record for the longest continuous unmanned flight. The aircraft, a Zephyr, stayed aloft for 82 hours and 37 minutes powered by solar panels and a rechargeable battery at night.</p> <p>The flight, at the US army's Yuma ground in Arizona, more than doubled the record time but, since it was done to test the ability of Zephyr to relay ground radio messages, did not fulfil all the requirements of a world record attempt. </p> <p>However the aircraft's designers, at the defence firm QinetiQ, in the UK, think the plane could fly indefinitely. \"We think the aircraft, in future, will be capable of weeks or months duration,\" said Paul Davey, Zephyr's business development director at QinetiQ. </p> <p>The Ministry of Defence has funded the \u00a320m development of Zephyr so far.

  "<p>Britain has just suffered its weakest period of growth since the recession of the early 1990s. The economy \"ground to a halt\" in the second quarter of the year - the worst performance since the first quarter of 1992. The signs are that the news will get even more grim in the second half of this year.</p> <p>Note the deliberate use of language. In the world of conventional economics, countries suffer periods of weak expansion but enjoy spells of strong growth. When the economy fails to grow that is axiomatically a worse performance than when it does. It is \"grim\" news that Britain may fulfil the technical definition of recession - two consecutive quarters of negative growth - in the second half of 2008.</p> <p>This may strike some as a strange way of looking at things. Sure, the global economy is slowing. But what's so bad about that? Is it, in fact, bad news that the world economy will no longer grow at its recent rate of 5% a year? And if the answer to that question is \"no\", wouldn't it be good news if this modest retrenchment was turned into a full-blown slump? Indeed, why stop there? Shouldn't those who fear for the future of the planet pursue something akin to the Great Depression of the 1930s? </p> <p>It's an interesting thought. Logically, if the obsession with growth at all costs has increased emissions to the point where rising temperatures pose a threat to mankind's existence (as many experts believe) then a prolonged period of slow or negative growth will limit the damage to the environment. At the very least, it would provide a breathing space to come up with an international agreement on how to tackle the problem.</p> <p>There are many reasons why it is not quite as simple as that. My rudimentary understanding of the science of climate change is that concentrations of greenhouse gases have been building up over many decades, and you can't simply turn them off like a tap. Even a three- or four-year 1930s-style global slump would have little or no impact, particularly if it was followed by a period of vigorous catch-up growth. On a chart showing growth since the dawn of the industrial age 250 years ago, the Great Depression is a blip. Similarly, Britain's trade deficit always comes down in recessions because imports go down, but then widens again once the economy returns to its trend rate of growth.</p> <p>Politically, recessions are not helpful to the cause of environmentalism. Climate change is replaced by concerns about unemployment and stimulating growth. To be fair, politicians respond to what they hear from voters: Gordon Brown's survival as prime minister depends on how well his package of economic measures is received, not on what he does or doesn't do to limit greenhouse gases.</p> <p>Looking back, it is clear that every advance in the green movement has coincided with period of strong growth - the early 1970s, the late 1980s and the first half of the current decade. It was tough enough to get world leaders to make tackling climate change a priority when the world economy was experiencing its longest period of sustained growth: it will be mightily difficult to persuade them to take measures that might have a dampen growth while the dole queues are lengthening. </p> <p>Those most likely to suffer are workers in the most marginal jobs and pensioners who will have to pay perhaps 20% of their income on energy bills.</p> <p>Hence, recession does not offer even a temporary solution to the problem of climate change and it is a fantasy to imagine that it does. The real issue is whether it is possible to challenge the \"growth-at-any-cost model\" and come up with an alternative that is environmentally benign, economically robust and politically feasible. Hitting all three buttons is mightily difficult but attempting to do so is a heck of a lot more constructive than waiting for industrial capitalism to collapse under the weight of its own contradictions.</p> <p>Richard Douthwaite, author of the Growth Illusion in the 1990s, has come up with one possible way forward, which he calls Cap and Share. His analysis begins with three propositions - firstly that there needs to be a ceiling on carbon emissions at their current level; secondly, that rising oil and gas prices are leading to windfall gains - so-called economic rents - for oil producing countries and energy companies; and thirdly, that this redistribution of wealth will have the same sort of detrimental impact on the global economy and its tottering financial system as the first wave of petro-dollars from the Opec countries in the 1970s and early 1980s.</p> <p>According to Douthwaite, most oil fields were developed on the assumption of oil prices at $20 (\u00a310) a barrel. Last year, the cost of crude averaged $64 a barrel, and Douthwaite estimates that half of the $1,975bn paid for oil last year was a \"scarcity\" rent to fossil fuel producers. That represented a loss of income of $150 to each person on the planet. Oil prices look certain to average well over $70 a barrel in 2008, and at $120 a barrel, Douthwaite says oil producers would be making excess profits worth around 6% of global output.</p> <p>\"The problem with that is that the producers are not buying and consuming anything like that part of the world's production,\" he added. \"Instead, they are either lending the rent out through the wholesale money markets or using it to buy stakes in banks or property in heavily oil dependent countries.\"</p> <p>Douthwaite's idea is that everybody should get their fair share of the rent that derives from the scarcity of fossil fuels. There would be a new world energy agency with the task of cutting carbon emissions and it would do so by issuing permits for the amount of CO2 it believed consistent with this objective. These permits would be scarcer than the supplies of fossil fuels, which would raise their price. Consumers would realise their share of the economic rent from the sale of such permits to the oil producers. People in the poorest parts of the world, with low energy consumption, would gain most.</p> <p>The proposal is certainly an alternative to the \"growth-at-all-costs model\" and has definite economic attractions - the avoidance of a slump caused by the ferocious squeeze on energy consumers. Whether it is politically feasible is another matter. Douthwaite believes his scheme may be considered hopelessly utopian. Sadly, he may be right.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cap &amp; Share: Richard Douthwaite <a href=\"http://www.feasta.org\">feasta.org</a></p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The award-winning writer and producer behind The Thick of It and I'm Alan Partridge has called on the BBC to launch a subscription channel to fund rivals to ambitious US shows such as The Sopranos and The Wire. </p> <p>Armando Iannucci, who has made a string of acclaimed comedies for the BBC, said Britain needed its own rival to HBO, the American cable network that has become synonymous with distinctive, intelligent drama and comedy. </p> <p>He said a new, subscription-funded channel would free the BBC from its regulatory shackles and unleash a torrent of creativity. US subscription networks have been able to invest in slow-burning, complex dramas without the twin pressures of chasing ratings because of their advertisers, or justifying commissioning decisions to licence-fee payers.</p> <p>\"What I feel is missing from our screens is a channel that encourages adventurism and experimentation, backed by money,\" he told an audience of broadcasting executives at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International TV festival. </p> <p>\"A channel that becomes home of the best programme-makers, the best writers, the best directors and most visionary producers and format creators, a channel that becomes a brand for what is new and surprising but not compromised by the pressures of advertising or too tightly targeted an audience.\" </p> <p>The likes of HBO, Showtime and Comedy Central have become home to what is often lauded as some of the best television in the world, with recent hits including The Daily Show, Mad Men and Curb Your Enthusiasm. </p> <p>\"Uninhibited by the need to placate advertisers, the subscription networks have been given the opportunity to experiment, but on a big rather than timid scale,\" said Iannucci. </p> <p>He said they had also raised the bar for their major network rivals, resulting in a wave of original, high-concept shows such as Heroes, Lost and Prison Break. </p> <p>Those shows have also tended to sell well around the world and attract committed, loyal followings who will shell out for DVD box sets and related merchandise. </p> <p>Iannucci, whose hit The Thick of It mocked the world of politics, passionately defended the BBC but said it was inevitable its funding would be cut in the coming years and that \"whatever the BBC says and does, it will get it in the neck\". </p> <p>\"Let's take a wager that the BBC brand is the best TV brand in the world, that people will pay for that brand,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Let it hold on to all of its free channels and radio stations, but let it also build a new subscription service that will provide the very best in what the British television industry, the best in the world, can do.\" </p> <p>The programmes could eventually be shown on the free-to-air networks, and help could be made available for those who couldn't afford to subscribe, he said.</p> <p>A survey conducted by the BBC during the last debate about the level of the licence fee found that three-quarters of the viewing public wanted new services to be funded by subscription. </p> <p>Iannucci, who has his own comedy unit based at the BBC's TV Centre, said channel controllers in the UK had become overly prescriptive in recent years about the formats they required and the audiences they wanted to target, instead of trusting creative talent. </p> <p>At the BBC, he said, producers were in danger of being squeezed between a mass-market BBC1 and lesser-resourced digital channels such as BBC3 and BBC4. He said his plan for a subscription channel would help the BBC fight back against its critics. </p> <p>\"There's too much at stake, too vital a contribution to our culture, to let its critics start to pull it apart now. I want it to fight back with all the energy and resources it has. More specifically, I want it to plug a gap I still see in the British TV market, one which, once filled, can give the individual programme-maker the impetus to make the distinctive, the surprising, the lavish, the intimate, the experimental, unhampered by the constraints the BBC normally has to operate under.\"</p> <p>He admitted he wasn't \"going to begin to pretend how the economics of this would work\" and the idea would be likely to raise further complaints from rivals already up in arms about the BBC's increasingly aggressive commercial arm. </p> <p>During another festival session yesterday, Time Out founder Tony Elliott attacked the BBC for being \"out of control\" following its purchase of travel guidebook publisher Lonely Planet. </p> <p>Iannucci also echoed an earlier call from Peter Fincham, ITV's director of television, who delivered the keynote MacTaggart lecture at the festival on Friday, not to confuse myriad new-media outlets with a diminished desire from viewers for high-quality programmes to watch on them. </p> <p>Broadcasters such as BBC, ITV and Channel 4 are coming under pressure as the historical models that have supported them collapse, leading to some of the optimism generated by Fincham's rallying cry draining away over the weekend as their futures were debated.</p> <p>But for programme-makers, Iannucci said it was a \"profoundly exciting moment in television for the creative talent\" because their work was now available to a global audience. </p> <p>He said he was amazed at the upsurge in interest in British comedy in the US, which has partly come about because it is now easy for US executives to sample it online.</p> <h2>US hits</h2> <p><strong>The Wire (HBO)</strong> </p> <p>Sprawling, Shakespearean crime tale set in Baltimore and sporting a huge cast. Regularly cited as a favourite show by television executives addicted to the DVD box sets. Now in its fifth and final season. </p> <p><strong>The Sopranos (HBO)</strong> </p> <p>Another regular contender for \"greatest show ever\", the tale of a New Jersey mafia clan ran for six series between 1999 and 2007, when it came to an ambiguous end. </p> <p><strong>The Daily Show (Comedy Central)</strong></p> <p>Jon Stewart's caustic take on the daily news has introduced a new satirical tone to America's news landscape. </p> <p><strong>Battlestar Galactica (Sci-Fi Channel)</strong> </p> <p>Ronald D Moore's remake of the 1970s science fiction show has won several Emmy awards and was rapturously received by critics as an allegory of American foreign policy.</p> <p><strong>Mad Men (AMC)</strong> </p> <p>Critically acclaimed drama tracking the changing attitudes of 1960s America through the eyes of fast-talking Madison Avenue ad men.</p>",

  "<p>The star turn at today's opening of the Democratic convention, watched by up to 20 million Americans on primetime TV, will fall to three people with surprisingly down-to-earth CVs: a hospital manager, a basketball coach and a high-school teacher. But what they lack in glamorous titles they make up in blood and marital connections to Barack Obama.</p> <p>Today is unofficial family day in Denver, and instead of political luminaries and grandees of the party, the show will be dominated by the candidate's wife, brother-in-law and half-sister. Top of the billing will be Michelle Obama, with the build-up to her headline speech this evening provided by her brother, Craig Robinson, and Barack's half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng.</p> <p>There is nothing new in playing the family card at conventions - Tipper Gore spoke in support of her husband, Al, in 2000, John Kerry's daughter Alexandra was rolled out in 2004, and Laura Bush stumped for George on both occasions - but for family to dominate the first day's proceedings in this way is unusual.</p> <p>\"Family is shaping the content of the entire day, and that's not been done before,\" said Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University.</p> <p>The first of the three on stage will be Soetoro-Ng, who teaches in a school in Hawaii. Aged 38, she is nine years younger than Barack. They have the same mother, the late Ann Dunham. Soetoro-Ng is likely to talk about how Barack filled in as a father figure in her life after her parents divorced when she was nine.</p> <p>\"He let me know the world was large, and that I should get to know as much of it as possible,\" she said recently.</p> <p>Then it will be over to Robinson, who will introduce his sister, Michelle Obama. Two years her elder, he has been relatively sparingly used by the Democratic campaign so far but his charisma and engaging smile is expected to be highly televisual.</p> <p>More importantly, he also represents a story that the Obama campaign is keen to highlight throughout the week - that the senator for Illinois and his immediate family have got to where they are today through their own hard work rather than through birth or privilege.</p> <p>\"Craig is an example of the classic American dream,\" says John Rogers, a Chicago businessman who played basketball with Robinson at Princeton University.</p> <p>Rogers points out that Robinson, like his sister, rose from modest beginnings in a four-room bungalow on Chicago's South Side to professional success - in his case as coach for Oregon State university's basketball team.</p> <p>That theme of honest graft appeals to the Obama campaign as a stick with which to beat the Republican opponent, John McCain, whose wealth was largely acquired through his wife Cindy's inheritance.</p> <p>\"They want to contrast the story of Obama, who has been through struggles that many Americans are now facing, with McCain, who seems increasingly out of touch,\" said Mark Mellman, a top strategist for Kerry in his 2004 presidential run.</p> <p>It was Robinson's achievement in getting to Princeton that gave his sister the inspiration to follow in his footsteps. Her stint at Princeton led on to Harvard Law School and then to a Chicago law firm, Sidley and Austin, where she met her future husband.</p> <p>Michelle Obama's speech this evening, timed for maximum TV exposure, will be the highlight of the day but also carries the highest stakes. In the run-up to the convention, the attacks on her have gathered in intensity. Typical of the genre is The Obama Nation, a new book by Dr Jerome Corsi, who four years ago was a leading proponent of the swift boat attack on John Kerry, which sought to undermine the Democratic candidate's record as a Vietnam war hero.</p> <p>Corsi follows the by-now well-trailed portrayal of Michelle Obama as an angry black woman. He dwells on her Princeton thesis on race relations, with its references to the writings of black radical Stokely Carmichael - a connection first made by the British writer Christopher Hitchens - and reminds readers of her gaffe when she talked about being really proud of her country for the \"first time in my adult lifetime\".</p> <p>Corsi concludes that she is a bitter person \"filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the United States\".</p> <p>Such assaults are increasingly vexing for the Obamas. In a recent Marie Claire interview, Barack Obama decried the caricature of his wife as an angry person and said \"She's the most quintessentially American person I know.\"</p> <p>The use of the term \"American\" is pointed. The official title of today's events is One Nation, and through the week the Democrats will seek to present the Obamas as a mainstream American family - no different from any other ordinary American household.</p> <p>It is a picture that crucially is neutral on race - an area that Obama has been consistently keen to keep out of the debate as much as possible.</p> <p>In the run-up to the convention, the campaign has tried to shift Michelle's public image towards the more homely one of housewife and mother.</p> <p>She has appeared on daytime chat shows and talked in interviews about the struggle of juggling work and kids, and Tyra Banks of America's Next Top Model poses as her on the cover of September's Harper's Bazaar, along with an Obama lookalike.</p> <p>\"The challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen. The question is whether she is willing to go along with that,\" Schiller said.</p> <p>Jerry Kellman came to know Michelle in the early days of her relationship with Obama. He predicts that she will prove herself to be a huge asset when she steps on to the stage: \"She is bright and she is gifted, but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that American voters will respond to.\"</p> <p>Kellman will himself be on stage in Denver today, as the man who in 1985 gave Obama his first job as a community organiser in Chicago, on a salary of $10,000 a year. In his speech, he hopes to \"make people aware of the kind of sacrifice Barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope\".</p> <p>A similar tone can be expected in a feature film made for the convention by Davis Guggenheim, who directed Al Gore's Oscar-winning movie An Inconventient Truth about global warming. Edward Kennedy will also address the floor for five minutes by video link from his home in Massachusetts, where he is receiving treatment for a malignant brain tumour.</p> <p>One of the most interesting aspects of the emphasis on family today is who will not be present. The most poignant absence will be that of Madelyn Dunham, or Toot as Obama calls her, his maternal grandmother, who lives in Hawaii, but who at 85 is said to be in fragile health.</p> <p>Absent too will be George Obama, Barack's half-brother and the youngest child of Barack Senior, the Kenyan economist who was briefly married to Ann Dunham while living in Hawaii as an overseas student. George, aged 25, was last week tracked down by the Italian edition of Vanity Fair living in a 6ft by 9ft shack on the outskirts of Nairobi.</p> <p>He told the magazine that he was so ashamed of his impoverished circumstances, living on less than a dollar a month, that he never mentions the fact that his half-brother could soon become the most powerful person on earth.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday August 27 2008. Tipper Gore (not Tippa, as we said in the article above) spoke in support of her husband, Al, at the 2000 Democratic convention. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Neil Fox may once have killed a man. But this is no Felix Dennis-style confession, rather a discovery that the DJ and former Pop Idol judge made about a previous life while filming for the ITV1 paranormal show Have I Been Here Before?. It turned out Fox had. \"It was a celebrity regression thing and I ended up in my mind going back to the middle ages,\" recalls Fox, who believes he was genuinely hypnotised. \"I was in somebody's castle - apparently I was in love with the local earl's daughter and he didn't want her to see me because I was just a travelling minstrel. So me and my bunch of merry men stormed his castle and I put an arrow through him.\"</p> <p>Which may be somewhere close to what Fox felt like doing five years ago when he missed out on the show he had always seemed destined to present - the Capital Radio breakfast show. Then the station's long-serving drivetime DJ, Fox seemed to be the front-runner to take over from Chris Tarrant, only for management to choose Johnny Vaughan. Back then he called management's running of the station \"appalling\". Now he is rather more relaxed. \"I had wanted to leave Capital for quite a time. I don't know whether I would have taken it,\" Fox says. </p> <p>But he can afford to be sanguine about Capital - because Fox has had the last laugh. Now at Capital's rival, Magic, he is the top commercial breakfast DJ in London according to the latest Rajar listening figures, ahead of both Johnny Vaughan - still at Capital and (briefly) reunited with his former Big Breakfast co-host Denise van Outen - and Jamie Theakston and Harriet Scott at Heart. \"This is my most enjoyable Rajar since doing radio ... it was particularly satisfying,\" says Fox. </p> <p>And having also beaten Radio 1's Chris Moyles in the latest figures, he is led only by Terry Wogan on Radio 2 and the Today programme on Radio 4. Now Fox has Wogan in his sights. \"We would love to beat Radio 2,\" he declares. \"I didn't want Capital to be my glory days, to be someone whose best radio was in my 30s and early 40s. I do genuinely think I am doing better broadcasting on Magic than I have ever done in my life.\"</p> <p>Formerly \"Dr\" Fox, then \"Foxy\", and now plain old Neil Fox, the DJ was not an obvious choice when he was hired by the \"more music, less talk\" station three years ago: \"People were quite surprised because I am not the quietest of DJs.\" He toned down his act, and has increased the breakfast audience by around a half - but surely a playlist that relies heavily on the likes of Michael Bubl\u00e9 and James Blunt is a bit, well, dull? \"The middle ground has been ignored for some time,\" Fox says. \"In the media, all the time everything has to be cool and cutting-edge. No, it doesn't.\"</p> <p>He is only 47, but Fox already seems to be displaying Victor Meldrew tendencies. His listeners, he says, \"don't give a shit about Britney Spears not looking slim anymore or that Lily Allen's tit dropped out. But they are interested in the price of petrol or that gas prices are going up 25%.\" His grumbles don't stop there - many TV and radio presenters \"can't speak the language properly and can't string sentences together - I find it dreadful,\" he says. </p> <p>The everyday, rather than the celebrity, is what he gives his listeners, Fox says. \"But they haven't come to Magic to listen to me standing on a soapbox preaching about stuff,\" he adds. \"We live in a pretty tough world and there is a lot of bad news out there. They come to us to lift their spirits. That sounds wonderfully idealistic but it's true. They come to us as a little oasis in a mad desert of depression and destruction and bad news and the credit crunch and wars.\"</p> <p>Crikey. And if that list of despair were not quite enough, Fox is not slow in flagging up the travails of his former station. Once London's undisputed </p> <p>No 1, Capital has suffered from a string of misfiring relaunches and for a time slipped into fourth place among the London commercial stations, behind Magic - which has now been No 1 for a record six consecutive quarters - Heart and the dance station Kiss. \"It's not been an overnight disaster, it's been a long-term disaster,\" says Fox.</p> <p>Capital's parent company, GCap Media, has been bought by Heart's owner, Global Radio, whose top executives include Fox's old boss at Capital, Richard Park, whom the DJ once described as the \"hardest bastard you've ever worked for in your life\".</p> <p>\"They clearly have an awful lot of work to do and you wonder where on earth do they start?\" says Fox. \"All of their stations are not doing well at the moment - Capital, Choice, even Heart. Everything is down, down, down.\"</p> <p>So what should Capital staff expect from Park? \"Fuck me he will be so fucking hands-on he will have his hands around people's necks. Before he was the programme director, now he is the owner. A canny Scotsman with his own money in a radio station? By god, he has got a plan, oh yes.\"</p> <p>The pair know each other well - their wives went into business together with a shop on Kings Road in west London. Fox's wife, Vicky, was a shoe designer and a former protege of Jimmy Choo. She has retrained as a yoga instructor. \"She is unfeasibly supple,\" volunteers Fox, rather unnecessarily. But if Park will be one of the key radio executives to watch over the next few years, then so will another of Fox's former colleagues - Tim Davie, the BBC's newly appointed director of audio and music, who was marketing chief at Pepsi when Fox presented the Sunday-afternoon Pepsi Chart Show.</p> <p>\"He is an extremely shrewd guy and very commercially minded,\" is Fox's take on the new BBC Radio chief. \"He loved the BBC even then. I remember all those years back we had a private conversation when he said it's shame we can't just sponsor the Radio 1 chart.</p> <p>\"I don't think that will be the story in five or 10 years' time. I think there is no doubt that BBC Radio will be the first to commercialise. The amount of money it costs to fund Radio 1 is just enormous. I think you will find some big brands - Pepsi, Coke, McDonald's - getting involved in some of their programming.\" </p> <p>Fox has almost worked for the BBC a couple of times. \"I nearly did the Radio 1 breakfast show, and the Radio 1 chart show,\" he says, but is reluctant to say when, other than \"the mid to late 90s\". \"There were lots of discussions but when you are contracted up the ying yang, as my partner would say, there is nothing you can do about it. It was one of those things. It didn't happen. I have zero regrets.\"</p> <p>A binliner salesman after leaving university, Fox's media career has treated him well: well enough to afford a \u00a31.5m home in Fulham and cars, at various times, including a Porsche, Aston Martin, Bentley GT and Ferrari Spider. At one point he even had his own helicopter. Then came three young children, a five-door Audi A3 and a seven-seater Jeep - but Fox still famously rides to work on his Harley Davidson.</p> <p>He also has a production company, Powder Blue, with three films in development, including one written by Jeffrey Archer about the mountaineer George Mallory. Bruce Beresford, of Driving Miss Daisy fame, is slated to direct and \"the best young British actor\" - Fox isn't saying who - will star as Mallory. \"We have got the director and the actor, the only thing we seem to be lacking at the moment, which does cause a slight problem, is $40m.\" Powder Blue also has three TV formats in development - a quiz show, an adventure documentary and an entertainment show. </p> <p>Fox's own TV career reached a high while judging on ITV1's Pop Idol, with other Saturday-night TV projects, such as ITV1's The Big Call, proving rather less memorable. Unlike, of course, his appearance on Chris Morris's Brass Eye in 2001, when he was tricked into saying paedophiles are genetically similar to crabs (\"That is scientific fact. There's no real evidence for it, but it's scientific fact.\")</p> <p>\"They got me hook, line and sinker,\" Fox says. \"I just thought it was a bit of a tasteless subject to do a comedy show about. </p> <p>\"It's a clever process. They don't send the script through to your agent to have a look at it. When you are there and the crew is there you do that bit, and then that bit, and when they play it back you are saying the most stupid things in the world. They made me look like a total dork.\"</p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae </strong><br><strong>Age</strong> 47<br><strong>Education</strong> Kingston grammar school; University of Bath<br><strong>Career</strong><br><strong>1985</strong> Radio Wyvern<br><strong>1987</strong> Joined Radio Luxembourg in February before switching to Capital Radio in October<br><strong>1993</strong> Started presenting the Pepsi Chart Show<br><strong>2001</strong> Became a judge on ITV1's Pop Idol<br><strong>2005</strong> Joined Magic</p>",
  "<p>I was intrigued recently to see a painting in the National Gallery by the Flemish artist David Teniers the Younger, in which a rich man is being led to hell through a subterranean crypt thronged with bats and snakes. Is the bat's nocturnal lifestyle enough to explain these centuries of misrepresentation? Yet while there is definitely nothing evil about bats there is something decidedly liminal. Their wings are no more than a diaphanous parchment, the thickness of a grape skin, stretched over a spider's web of finger-bone. It produces a motion so twisting and elusive you sometimes wonder, as you try to follow one in flight, whether you're seeing the actual creature or just some fading mental impression of a flying bat superimposed upon the space where one has just been.</p> <p>Their echo-location system is one of those truths that outdoes fiction. Bats blast their surroundings with a machine-gun fire of high-frequency pulses then wait for the rebounded calls, which are unscrambled in the bat brain as information on the relative distances and contours of an environment. Essentially they're hearing the appearance of a place. The system is so sensitive they can detect and avoid a wire the thickness of a human hair. They can identify an insect - and judge its edibility - by the way their echoes curve around it. One is flabbergasted not just by the idea of a world sculpted by voice, but by the inner labyrinth of the bat's neurological system which allows the creature a flight of such intricate convolutions when effectively blind. </p> <p>We followed our bat, probably a Daubenton's, on a bat detector, a device which converts the calls to sounds within the human range of audible frequencies. It was a thin metallic crepitation that intensified as the creature swirled down across Rockland Broad. At its closest, the bat's sounds acquired a tachycardia-like intensity and every now and then we caught the creature itself as a brief muster of skittering darkness.</p>",
  "<p>After a fortnight of conflict on the ground and a flurry of propaganda and debate in European capitals the South Ossetian crisis is winding down. One of the abiding images - a Russian masterstroke - will be the moving concert given by world-renowned Valery Gergiev, a North Ossetian, and the Mariinsky orchestra in the ruins of Tskhinvali, the town the Georgians destroyed.</p> <p>Another unforgettable memory will be Georgia's flak-jacketed president cowering on the ground as a Russian plane flies over the town of Gori. Bravado turning into humiliation is a metaphor for the whole foolish adventure. Georgian men are hospitable and engaging, but fond of bombast and empty macho gestures. Unlike the Chechens, who have fought Russians for centuries, Georgians prefer poetry and vineyards to the challenge of war. </p> <p>President Mikheil Saakashvili epitomises the style, made worse in his case by the lies he served up to deceive foreign opinion. He boasted of defeat. Georgia was being swallowed up, Tbilisi was on the verge of occupation, Russia was using weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>The biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the South Ossetian capital, which killed scores of civilians and 15 Russian peacekeepers. It was absurd to think Russia would not retaliate. So the next lie was to claim Russia's leaders had prepared a trap. In fact, they were taken by surprise as much as the Ossetians. Russia's initial response had the hallmarks of hasty improvisation - though, as the crisis unfolded, President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin showed increasing determination to exploit Saakashvili's folly by preventing South Ossetia and Abkhazia from ever being forced back under Georgian rule.</p> <p>Saakashvili and many of his western backers used ludicrous analogies to hype the crisis - from Poland in 1939 to Hungary in 1956, even though it is clear South Ossetians welcomed Russian aid and now want to break from Georgia once and for all. The more accurate comparison was Kosovo. Suppose Serbia's leaders were suddenly to kill US peacekeepers, fire rockets at civilian houses in Pristina and storm the town, wouldn't the Americans be expected to expel the invaders, even if the UN still recognises Kosovo as legally part of Serbia? </p> <p>Russia's destruction of Georgia's radar stations, its military and naval bases, and several bridges in order to degrade the country's military capability looks similar to Nato's attacks on Serbian infrastructure in 1999. Instead of confining itself to Kosovo in seeking to protect Albanian civilians from ethnic cleansing, Nato bombed deep into Serbia proper. What Russia did to Georgia was disproportionate, but less so than Nato on Serbia a decade ago. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Russia should pull back completely now. It should also have restrained South Ossetian militias from running amok against Georgian villages. Nato troops made little effort to stop revenge-seeking Albanians from looting and torching houses in the Serbian enclaves in Kosovo after Yugoslav forces were driven out. Russia's forces should have done better in Ossetia. They had the moral high ground but quickly forfeited it by not changing the patterns of military indiscipline and cruelty shown in Afghanistan and Chechnya as well as towards conscripts in their own ranks. </p> <p>How and why Saakashvili acted remains unclear. Did he tell the Americans of his plans? If not, he emerges as even more of a hothead than many in Nato feared. If yes, did the Americans approve? Giving him the green light would have been incredibly irresponsible. If the US warned Saakashvili off and he went ahead anyway, he should be condemned as an ally from hell. </p> <p>Did he think that by playing on ancient anti-Russian prejudice and hysterical cold war analogies he could swap an inevitable loss of territory for accelerated entry into Nato? If that was the gamble, it is paying off in some quarters. One of the grimmest aspects of this crisis was the degree to which John McCain emerged as an undiplomatic hawk. Before the crisis he was on record as calling Putin \"a totalitarian dictator\" and saying Russia should be expelled from the G8. As Russia came in to defend South Ossetia, he demanded it pay a \"serious negative\" price. </p> <p>In Britain David Cameron showed similar wildness. Gordon Brown and David Miliband were little better. Instead of the relative even-handedness of Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel, New Labour followed the White House line. Could it not bring itself to utter any criticism of Saakashvili? Even as poodles, does this government not see that the next potential US president, Barack Obama, is more nuanced? He called on Georgia, as well as Russia, to show restraint. </p> <p>That said, there is only a slight chance the US, under any president, will do the sensible thing, which would be to announce Nato expansion has reached its limit and that no invitation to Georgia - or Ukraine - will ever be issued. </p> <p>The mantra is that Russia cannot have a veto on Nato membership. True, but by the same token no country has a right to join Nato, or the EU. Look at Turkey, which has been a loyal Nato ally for four decades but was not allowed to start EU membership proceedings until 2005 and still has no guarantee they will succeed. Neither Russia nor the applicants decide who enters the club. Its existing members do. Whatever the next US president thinks, and whatever other traditionally anti-Russian countries such as Poland and the Baltic states feel, there are European countries that see the danger of extending the Nato umbrella where the alliance's founders never meant it to go. Nato is not a global institution. It has no business looking for new members in the Caucasus or central Asia. </p> <p>Nato and Russia are boycotting each other for the moment. But business will soon resume as western leaders see this was a manufactured crisis rather than the start of a new cold war or some cataclysmic shift in international relations. When Nato's foreign ministers met last week, France and Germany made that point. The alliance promised reconstruction aid to Georgia but no support for rushing it into Nato. Earlier this year, France and Germany had the courage to defy Washington and say it was too early to invite Georgia. They were right then, and are even more so now.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Friday August 29 2008.

  "<p>Like so many modern conflicts, the hallmark of the latest war in Georgia is that civilians have borne the brunt of the fighting.</p> <p>At the outset of this war, the Georgian military used indiscriminate and disproportionate force resulting in civilian deaths in South Ossetia. The Russian military has since used indiscriminate force in attacks in South Ossetia and in the Gori district, and has <a href=\" http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/aug/16/group-accuses-russia-of-using-cluster-bombs/\">apparently targeted</a> convoys of civilians, killing and wounding them as they have attempted to flee the conflict zones. </p> <p>In parts of Georgia currently under Russian control, ongoing looting, arson attacks, and abductions by militia are <a href=\" http://hrw.org/\">terrorising</a> the civilian population, forcing them to flee their homes and preventing displaced people from returning home. </p> <p>Now that the shooting war <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/22/georgia.russia2\">is over</a>, there is an urgent need for the deployment of an international security mission to help protect civilians and create a safe environment for the displaced to return home. </p> <p>Protection of civilians is not only a good in itself, but can also help to prevent recurring attacks that could reignite a conflict in which \u2013 as the recent heated rhetoric in Washington, Moscow and European capitals indicates \u2013 there is much more at stake than the future of a couple of Russian backed separatist enclaves in Georgia. </p> <p>A civilian protection mission in Georgia is a job well suited for the European Union. Led by France, EU diplomats and politicians have already shown initiative by <a href=\"http://www.premier-ministre.gouv.fr/en/information/latest_news_97/nicolas_sarkozy_brokers_agreement_60816.html\">brokering a ceasefire</a>. They should now follow that up by immediately starting work on the swift deployment of a civilian protection mission that may well help that ceasefire stick.</p> <p>In the past half decade the EU has deployed almost 20 missions under its European security and defence policy (ESDP). These have included full-blown military operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Bosnia, border-monitoring operations in Moldova and on the Gaza/Egypt border, ceasefire monitoring in Aceh in Indonesia, \"security sector reform\" missions in the Balkans, West Bank, Iraq and Afghanistan, and a civilian protection mission in Chad. In 2004, Brussels even despatched a civilian ESDP mission to Georgia to help the Georgian government to strengthen the rule of law.</p> <p>An ESDP mission has three obvious advantages in the current crisis in Georgia. First, it is easier and faster to deploy than a UN mission: time is of the essence in the current crisis. Second, it is not threatening and therefore stands a chance of being accepted by the Russians. In this context it should be made clear that any European deployment would have limited aims: it would most definitely not aim to take over from the existing peacekeeping arrangements in South Ossetia and Abkhazia but would assist Russia to withdraw in an orderly manner from those areas it agreed to withdraw from under the latest ceasefire agreement. Third, the EU is now reasonably experienced in the areas of \"soft security\" \u2013 border monitoring, policing and police training, civilian protection, strengthening rule of law \u2013 that an ESDP mission is likely to have to deal with in Georgia.</p> <p>Remove the cold war rhetoric from the equation and it is quite possible that the Russian government, having made its point to Georgia and to the world, actually now has a political interest in withdrawing from the areas of Georgia its forces have occupied over the past couple of weeks. But Georgian security capacities have been squashed and there are real questions about how to manage such a withdrawal without jeopardising the safety of civilians, and how to allow the swift and safe return of those who have been displaced to their homes.</p> <p>A limited ESDP civilian protection mission would address those questions, boost the confidence of civilian populations on both sides of the conflict, and help the Russians to honour their agreement to withdraw. </p> <p>But the EU needs to move fast at a number of levels to make it happen. It needs to work round the clock diplomatically to persuade the Russians that such a mission is in Russia's interests as well as Georgia's and the EU's. It needs to design a concept of operations for what will be one of the EU's most ambitious, high profile and multifaceted ESDP mission thus far. And it needs to pull together the military, police and logistical personnel required for such a force.</p> <p>If it worked, an ESDP mission in Georgia mandated to protect civilians would be a huge feather in the EU's cap, a validation of its \"soft power\" approach to foreign affairs and conflict management, as well as a service to the thousands of civilians who have already suffered so terribly in this conflict and who badly need the EU's protection.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Armando Iannucci</strong>, the comedy writer and producer, has today called on the BBC to make more money out of its content by setting up a HBO-style subscription service.</p> <p>Delivering the Alternative MacTaggart lecture at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival, Iannucci called on the BBC to establish the pay-TV service to showcase its output as the \"best in the world\" and to generate more income than it currently does with its commercial arm BBC Worldwide.</p> <p>He said the BBC needed to \"wager\" that it was the best television brand in the world and set up the service to free itself up to \"sell quality shows more aggressively on the international market\".</p> <p>Iannucci added that he was not sure how the economics of his idea would work and added that the service would need financial assistance and probably a guarantee that all content shown on the subscription service would ultimately find a way onto the BBC's free to air UK services such as BBC1.</p> <p>\"I so want the BBC to clobber its critics by demonstrating what it does best, make brilliant output in an environment in which this mission is unchecked,\" added Iannucci, a key creative force behind the comedy character Alan Partridge and the hit BBC4 political comedy The Thick Of It.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging speech championing the role of the programme-makers and content providers, Iannucci added that the BBC needed to fight back and \"not be so kind to its critics\".</p> <p>Speaking after his lecture Iannucci added that he felt the need for the BBC to make more money out of its programmes because he had \"felt the restriction on resources\" at the corporation.</p> <p>He said that these restrictions were more acute with the kind of experimental programme-making he specialises in with his standalone SLAP comedy unit, which he runs at the BBC.</p>",

Britain came agonisingly close to an amazing third place, behind only the world's most populous nation and the world's most super-awesome nation.

But an exclusive Guardian investigation can exclusively reveal that two of their 23 golds came in synchronised swimming and two in rhythmic gymnastics, which are <strong>not really sports at all</strong>.</p> <p>And one more came in the 10km walk, which is in fact just <strong>someone going for a long stroll</strong>. </p> <p>Feel free to send in your boos, hisses and grrs this shamefaced robbery of Britain's rightful placing to the above address.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>11.57am: IMPORTANT NEWS</strong> The closing ceremony will of course, feature the official moment when Beijing ceases to be the Olympic host city and London takes it place. </p> <p>That moment will occur when IOC President and professional killjoy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/21/olympics2008.olympicsathletics3\">Jacques Rogge</a> hands the Olympic flag to Boris 'Beano' Johnson, who must then wave the flag six times before it is carried out of the stadium in a triumphant procession.</p> <p>Which all sounds a bit like druids prancing around on Salisbury Plain, to be honest.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>12.09pm: </strong>Also featuring in this celebration of all things London are the Radio 4 shipping forecast, a double-decker bus, Greensleeves, umbrellas and...Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, formerly known for rock'n'roll excesses, long-term heroin and cocaine use, a fascination with the occult and generally being the <strong>best rock axeman ever</strong>. </p> <p>In terms of handing in your rock credentials, it's not quite the same as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4nsifplvpk\">Brian May playing God Save the Queen from the roof of Buckingham palace</a>, but it's close.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>12.11am: </strong>The closing ceremony officially starts at 1pm, handover to Boris at around 2pm.

Getting into events was difficult, lots of venues were half-empty, and it wasn't all as it seemed on TV.<br><strong><br>Michael Johnson</strong> agrees with him, and they've won nine gold medals between them over five Olympiads, so there'll be no argument on that one.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12.45pm: </strong> <strong>Michael Johnson</strong> has been absolutely brilliant.

They seem to have been given free rein to do what they like. What a refreshing change from the usual nonsense.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>1.31pm: </strong>The Canadians are wearing zogabongs.

Yes, Uthayanan, this ceremony officially absolves the chattering classes of any guilt. Well done everyone for a truly half-hearted effort.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>2.00pm: </strong>Apparently, a young schoolboy in Melbourne wrote to the Beijing Games organising committee and said that the closing ceremonies were too stuffy and, well, ceremonial. Let the athletes run free, said John, for that is his name. I can't believe that actually worked.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>2.01pm: God Save The Queen</strong> is what they are singing in the Bird's Nest, and the Union Flag has been raised. It's members of the National Youth Theatre who are doing the singing and the London Symphony Orchestra are accompanying them. </p> <p>Now they are singing the Olympic hymn. It's a good 'un, too.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>2.02pm: </strong>That waffling from Rogge a few minutes back was officially announcing the end of the Beijing Olympics.</p> <p><strong>Here's Boris! </strong></p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>2.04pm: </strong>He's waving to the nice people and making his way to the central podium.

He boots the ball into one of the dancers and disappears into a puff of smoke. Or something like that. You remember David Bowie in Labyrinth?</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>2.18pm:</strong> \"Fun, a sense of humour and a little bit quirky.

And it's Becks! He gets another huge cheer from the crowd.</p> <p>No cheers for Jimmy. That was <em>Jimmy Page</em>, you fools! He was in Led Zeppelin!</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>3.03pm: </strong><strong>The Great Bus Debate continues</strong></p> <p>If the MBM is a microcosm of Britain as a whole, and I firmly believe it to be, then the London 2012 organisers have done a fantastic job of getting people talking. The response has been overwhelming.</p> <p>Richard Vale is on the YAY! side. In a rather negative way.<br>\"Our few minutes was perfectly fine, so chill out. Yesterday people on the blog were assuming it wold be a Route Master and criticising that for being \"stuck in the past\" option, now you are complaining because it wasn't one. You're only happy when you have something to moan about, pathetic.</p> <p>Would one of you like to suggest exactly what we should have done with those 8 minutes that would have been sooo much better?\"</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>3.08pm: Leon Smith is on the '&amp;$%@!!!!!' side. </strong></p> <p>All the words I cut out were very bad ones indeed. None of your damns or your blasts here.</p> <p>\"Give me 10 seconds to come up with a [SNIP!], literal, narrow minded, boring and predictable idea for the China / UK hand over of the Olympics and I'd have come up with David [SNIP!] Beckham on a red bus with dancers twirling bastard umbrellas. [SNIP! SNIP! SNIP! SNIP!] sake.\"</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>3.12pm: We're done. That's the end of 16 days of live coverage of the Beijing Games with the best news, blogs, reports, jingoism and Naylorisms that money can buy. And it was all free.</strong></p> <p>For more MBM action, Paul Doyle is watching Wigan v Chelsea and he's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/24/premierleague.wiganathletic\">telling it like it is </a> </p> <p>Gemma Briggs has just brought the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/24/formulaone.motorsports1\">curtain down on the European Grand Prix. </a></p> <p>And I'll be back in ten minutes as we introduce a new MBM format: following Boris home to Blighty. What will he say? Who will he insult? How good is your public school Latin?</p> <p>Thanks for all your e-mails. Especially you, Gary.</p>"
