  "<p>Gordon Brown said today he was hopeful of success in his attempts to persuade dollar-rich Gulf states to prop up ailing national economies through a massive injection of capital into the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p> <p>The prime minister spent three hours in one-to-one talks with Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, trying to persuade the monarch to invest in a revamped IMF.</p> <p>On the first leg of a four-day visit to the Middle East, and aiming to secure hundreds of billions of dollars for the fund, Brown called off a planned dinner with business leaders accompanying him so as to allow maximum negotiating time with the Saudi king.</p> <p>The IMF currently has around $250bn in its emergency reserves but there are fears that, with Hungary, Iceland and Ukraine having already sought assistance and more nations expected to follow, the sum might not be sufficient. </p> <p>Brown hopes to persuade Gulf leaders to use some of the estimated $1tn they have made from high oil prices in the last few years to boost the reserves, indicating that he would like to see the current sum increased by \"hundreds of billions\" of dollars. </p> <p>The prime minister said following the talks that he was hopeful of having secured Saudi backing.</p> <p>Speaking on the BBC television's Sunday AM programme, Brown said: \"I think people want to invest both in helping the world get through this very difficult period of time but I also think people want to work with us so we are less dependent on oil and have more stability in oil prices.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The Saudis will, I think, contribute, so we can have a bigger fund worldwide.\"</p> <p>However, a senior government source party to the negotiations said the Saudis were very sensitive about being regarded as a \"cash cow\" and that the country, in which two thirds of the population are below the age of 25, would prioritise domestic investment if necessary.</p> <p>The business secretary, Peter Mandelson, accompanying Brown on the trip, echoed this caution. He played down expectations, indicating that the government was unlikely to learn whether the Saudis would contribute towards the IMF fund until a meeting of 20 countries in Washington on November 15. Mandelson told reporters that talks with the Saudis were a \"process not an event\". </p> <p>Both Brown and Mandelson indicated that the Saudis would only buy into the scheme if significant reform of the global institutions was achieved to bring on board rising powers such as Saudi Arabia, India and Brazil. </p> <p>Business leaders on the trip - described by Brown as the \"highest profile group of business leaders ever to accompany a delegation overseas\" - said the prime minister was receiving something of a \"hero's welcome\" for his part in the global response to the recent economic downturn, and that this was softening his dealings with Saudis. </p> <p>Brown arrived later in the afternoon in Doha, Qatar for the second leg of his tour.</p>",
  "<p>You would think that with Barack Obama holding a healthy lead in the polls political pundits would not want to look foolish by proclaiming him in risky territory. But Dick Morris, the strategist, author and columnist, did just that last Wednesday.</p> <p>Obama \"has assumed many of the characteristics of an incumbent\", <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/10/undecideds_should_break_for_mc.html\">wrote</a> Morris. \"Every voter asks himself one question before he or she casts a ballot: do I want to vote for Obama? His uniqueness, charisma and assertive programme have so dominated the dialogue that the election is now a referendum on Obama.\" Obama is running an incumbent-like campaign, Morris says, so it is a referendum on him. So he may be in trouble. \"His election likely hangs in the balance,\" Morris concluded. \"Likely a disproportionate number of the undecideds will vote for McCain.\"</p> <p>Don't count on it. Throughout the election many supposed experts have made major miscalculations about how voters will perceive the campaign. That's because they, like Morris, often analyse the election through the lens of strategy, particularly the strategy of how a candidate presents his personality, rather than the issues. </p> <p>For instance, after the final presidential debate, CNN's over-sized roundtable of experts was in general agreement: by aggressively attacking Obama throughout the evening McCain had improved on his earlier two performances. <br> \"Here's what I saw of John McCain. He was aggressive, and he was strong. He was on offence. I thought Obama was flat, professorial, didn't rise to the occasion\" said Bill Bennett. \"McCain was just hammering him, and I think he scored a lot of points.\"</p> <p>\"It was by far McCain's best performance over the three debates,\" agreed John King. \"It was by far McCain's most aggressive, assertive.\" </p> <p>But less than an hour later, CNN's own instant tracking polls, and others, showed a significant win for Obama. It turns out that regular voters didn't care about who was \"on offence\". Fifty-seven percent of independent voters thought Obama won the debate, according to CNN's poll, compared to 31% for McCain \u2013 roughly the same margin as the first two debates as well. In contrast to the pundits, voters assessed the debates more on the substance than tone. </p> <p>Voters do not base their decision on whether a candidate was \"aggressive\" or surprised them with their campaign strategy. Pundits and prognosticators get a kick out of those things because it makes for a more entertaining campaign. But voters decide on the issues. That's why at the town halls in Iowa and New Hampshire voters ask questions like \"I don't have health insurance, what will you do about that?\" while in the press availability afterward reporters ask questions like \"Will you be buying television ads?\" </p> <p>Examples of how that disconnect has made pundits predict wrongly abound. Consider the case of Sarah Palin. When she was selected as McCain's vice-president, the media was awash in speculation that she would appeal to alienated Hillary Clinton supporters and drive down Obama's margins among women. <br> In a September 10 CNN web column titled <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/09/schreiber.palin/index.htm\">Don't underestimate Palin's appeal to women</a>, professor and author Ronnee Schreiber asserted that Palin would upend Democrats' traditional advantage among women. \"The nomination of Sarah Palin has turned our assumptions about women and politics on their head,\" Schreiber wrote. \"Many Democrats have presumed that her policy positions run contrary to those held by women, and that women will not vote for her.\"<br> But the opposite happened. In a <a href=\"http://people-press.org/report/462/obamas-lead-widens\">recent Pew poll</a>, 49% of Americans held a negative view of Palin, and fully 60% of women did. A New York Times/CBS News poll on Friday found that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/us/politics/31poll.html?ref=todayspaper\">59% of voters thought she was not prepared for the job</a> \u2013 up nine points since the beginning of October. </p> <p>Most women are ultimately voting on the issues that affect them, such as economic security, reproductive rights and the environment. Nominating a candidate who opposes abortion rights and most environmental regulation and has little economic expertise is not going to appeal to most women, who tend to be more liberal on those issues than men. But the pundits were swept up in the excitement over the unconventionality of picking Palin and its potential to be a \"game changer\".</p> <p>And if you go back to the primaries, a lot of supposed experts made predictions that look awfully silly today. For instance in November of last year, no less a Washington institution than the <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/281epojr.asp\">Weekly Standard's Fred Barnes boldly declared</a>: \"At this point, with the first voting just nine weeks away, only two candidates \u2013 Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney \u2013 have credible scenarios. In that sense, the Republican campaign has become a two-man race, Rudy v Mitt. John McCain and Fred Thompson may not like this.\" Neither, apparently, did the Republican electorate, which only two months later began handing McCain a string of victories and hastily dispatched with Giuliani. </p> <p>Perhaps that's because the voters cared more about issues on which they disagreed with Giuliani and agreed with McCain, such as abortion, than they did about \"credible scenarios\". But the cult of strategy is so entrenched in punditry that even an openly ideological talking head such as Barnes pays more attention to scenarios and fundraising than to the issues, at least when prognosticating on electoral outcomes.</p> <p>So when you tune in on Tuesday, tune out the pundits, especially when they start telling you how the election turned on who was on offence or scored points or ran an incumbent-style campaign.</p>",
  "<p>Anna Masera recently made a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/22/italy.creditcrunch\">heartfelt plea</a> that something be done about the state of her nation's economy, citing considerable evidence that Italy is the economic basket case of Europe. </p> <p>It's true that by the standard economic measures, Italy's economy was struggling badly even before the financial crisis hit. Further, it suffers from a regional disparity of wealth which dwarves the north-south divide here in the UK \u2013 per capita GDP in the poor south is half that of the country as a whole. And its record on integrating immigrant communities into the economy is also very poor. Nonetheless, from what I saw on a recent visit, one small corner of the admittedly more prosperous north appears to be in impressively rude economic health.</p> <p>Of course, two weeks of cloudless skies, cold beer and exquisite Italian food can make for an overly optimistic world view, but there was plenty of evidence to confirm my belief that the countries of continental Europe have made a better job than we Brits of maintaining the social infrastructure necessary to protect communities from the ravages of global capitalism.</p> <p>We spent our first week in Castelnuovo di Garfagnana, a small town in the hills north of Lucca. Sufficiently inaccessible to be out of reach of all but the most determined tourist, this is a community where economic development appears to have proceeded at a manageable pace, and on a reassuringly human scale. An economically self-sustaining small town (population around 6,000) where, according to the latest census data, the workforce of 3,520 is divided between 878 different firms. That's an average of 4.5 people per workplace; most of which were either owner managed, or run as cooperatives.</p> <p>The town is not especially wealthy, but what wealth exists appears to be evenly distributed, as you'd expect where business ownership is spread widely and many people are self-employed. There are no big supermarkets and no chains, although many recognisable brands are available from independently owned shops. The result is a far greater greater variety of outlets and goods than you would find in a British town of similar size or location.<br> During the week long summer festival that coincided with our visit, each evening the townspeople turned out it in vast numbers to eat and drink, the latter in noticeable moderation. Happy \u2013 and exceptionally well-dressed \u2013 teenagers rubbed shoulders with people four times their age. Despite the large crowds there was no hint of threatening or anti-social behaviour.</p> <p>The same was evident when we moved onto Levanto, a small seaside town with a successful tourism-based economy. Again there were no supermarkets or chains, just well-run owner-managed businesses which stocked everything you could possibly need at reasonable prices. There was little sign of great riches in either town, but evidence of a social wealth that Britain seems to have lost in its rush to embrace the global economy.</p> <p>Italy's economy is neither the most stable nor productive in Europe, but despite, or perhaps because of this, it does appear to serve the needs of people in many rural communities for employment and leisure, and in a way that further cements community cohesion. In the UK, many rural communities have been decimated by a national economy geared principally to meeting the demands of global markets.</p> <p>So what have the Italians done differently? History, geography, culture and religion all play a role. Unlike Britain, Italy didn't have to endure the rapid enclosure of land that foreshadowed the industrial revolution. People weren't forced into large towns so the economy never developed into one in which the majority are dependent on employment by someone else. Not everyone in rural Italy is self-employed, but self employment seems a more viable prospect than it is in much of Britain.</p> <p>Perhaps the fact that Italy only became a unified political entity in 1861 has worked in its favour. Whatever the secret of its apparent success \u2013 despite almost third world levels of poverty in parts of the South, it ranked 8th in The Economist's 2005 quality of life index <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf\">(pdf)</a> while the UK languished in 29th \u2013 it doesn't seem to have anything much to do with politics, unless its trademark political instability has allowed Italians to get on with the business of living, and to work out for themselves those aspects of modernity that suit them, and ignore the rest.</p> <p>The lesson for the UK? I'm not sure how you undo the damage inflicted on small communities left unprotected from the downside of globalisation. What is clear from the Italian example is that small towns thrive when the ownership of economic resources and access to opportunities is widely distributed. Castelnuovo and Levanto are, in their different ways, perfect examples of Schumacher's dictum that Small is Beautiful; at least if you want an equitable economic base on which to create a happy and healthy society.</p>",
  "<p>It's currently the most tantalising guessing game in global affairs: exactly what is the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/world/asia/29kim.html?scp=1&amp;sq=jong-il&amp;st=cse\">state of Kim Jong-il's health</a>?</p> <p>A series of reports variously claim that the North Korean leader is recovering after a stroke or similar ailment, and that a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/korea-japan\">French brain surgeon</a> has been consulted. </p> <p>Kim's absence from a series of major set piece events, the latest of which was Thursday's <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-funeral1-2008nov01,0,248533.story\">funeral for Pak Song-chol</a>, one of the founding fathers of the communist regime, has fuelled speculation about a power vacuum in the world's only hereditary communist dictatorship.</p> <p>North Korea's <a href=\"http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm\">state-run media</a> has attempted \u2013 rather ham-fistedly \u2013 to counter this impression by issuing photographs of Kim purportedly attending recent events.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/korea\">Pictures released a fortnight ago</a> supposedly showing the 66-year-old visiting a women's military unit, the first new images of Kim for two months, were called into question when South Korean experts claimed foliage visible in the background indicated the pictures were in fact taken over the summer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7704648.stm\">More photos</a>, released today, are equally frustrating. Kim, wearing his trademark Liza Minelli-esque sunglasses and a brown sports jacket, is pictured inside what looks like an executive spectator box.</p> <p>The captions claim he was watching a football game between two army-affiliated teams. Other photos show the football match with autumnal-looking tress in the background, but no Kim.</p> <p>So does Kim remain on his sickbed? No one outside North Korea really knows. At least, if he did really attend the match, Kim seemed to have enjoyed it. According to state media he took \"great satisfaction over a high level of the game\".</p>",
  "<p>One thing London can be grateful for when it comes to the next Olympics is that it's still four years away. Enough time, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/24/olympics-london-sport\">Simon Jenkins</a> argues to change the plan. Or if things get really bad, call it off altogether.</p> <p>This is not a luxury available to the hosts of the next mega-event on the global sporting calendar, the 2010 Fifa World Cup.</p> <p>South Africa has already boasted too loudly and spent too much to do anything now except push on to the end. Even if the rest of the world stays home and watches on TV.</p> <p>This would not be a good result since we are squandering our grandchildren's inheritance getting ready to receive you.</p> <p>In my home city, Cape Town, for instance, we are putting up an enormous and ruinously expensive 68,000 seat German-designed <a href=\"http://coda.co.za/blog/2008/05/07/green-point-stadium\">super venue</a>. The stadium already dwarfs the commonage and low-rise flatland of its well-to-do Green Point neighbourhood, and it's not even half-finished. At a current estimate of 4.5bn rand (\u00a3250m), it's already 50% over budget, but it's early days.</p> <p>Not only is the stadium far too big for a city where even premier league matches struggle to attract 15,000 spectators, but most of those spectators live far away in the dusty townships of the Cape Flats. </p> <p>Early in the planning, there was considerable official and public enthusiasm for the new venue to be built in one of the poorest areas, where the need for sports facilities and transport infrastructure is painfully obvious.</p> <p>Green Point was chosen, according to popular legend, because Sepp Blatter didn't want shack settlements spoiling the occasional panoramic camera shot. On the other hand, the <a href=\"http://www.mg.co.za/article/2007-01-26-did-rasool-oil-hospital-deal\">provincial premier</a> at the time had links to a Dubai company interested in buying a piece of prime property right next to the current site. Maybe it was a happy coincidence of interests. Unhappily, they didn't coincide with the needs of the people who will be paying the bill for years to come.</p> <p>Cape Town is not the only city throwing its treasure into unnecessary, inappropriate, unsustainable and sometimes downright dubious projects for what the local organising committee continues to insist will be the \"best ever\" World Cup.</p> <p>All in all, South Africans will be forking out for five brand new super-stadia as well as elaborate extensions and upgrades to five existing ones.</p> <p>We're also spending money we don't have on bigger airports, new airports, more roads and a very expensive high-speed train which may or may not be ready in time to whisk visiting fans from Johannesburg's revamped or Tambo Airport to the swanky hotel and shopping district of Sandton. </p> <p>And because our national electricity provider has unexpectedly run out of capacity, we are importing brand new diesel-fired back-up generators, and extra diesel, just to make sure the floodlights stay on.</p> <p>The budget for the event itself has ballooned from R2.3bn (\u00a3120m) in 2004, when the bid was awarded, to R23bn (\u00a31.2bn) today. This may sound like a bargain to Londoners, but for us, it's a reckless extravagance. (And bear in mind the rand is losing value even faster than the pound.)</p> <p>In return, we were promised an economic boom - foreign investment, a flood of rich tourists, sustainable jobs, business opportunities and the admiration of the world.</p> <p>But as former host nations have learnt to their ongoing cost, mega sporting events never deliver what it says on the cheerleaders' T-shirts, even at the best of times</p> <p>Not even China can point to any quantifiable return on its massive investment. All it can claim is a brief surge in national pride, already overwhelmed by poisoned milk.</p> <p>If national pride is all South Africa can hope for, we're in deep trouble. Even a best-ever World Cup means little to the host country if its team disappoints. Our once heroic Bafana-Bafana are currently 85th in the world rankings. Their courtesy invitation to the world's soccer showcase has become an embarrassment. We expect a run on Brazilian shirts. </p> <p>Still, at least now, if we're left bankrupt, we can blame the world economy rather than our own vainglory.</p> <p>Tickets are due to go on sale in January. If you do come, please use water and electricity sparingly.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339230668\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1892234764_LOCKED-FINAL-KUCINICH-OH-10-31-FLV-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Dennis Kucinich learned long ago to take nothing for granted in American politics. The former mayor of Cleveland and current <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ohio\">Ohio</a> congressman has carved out a long career as one of the nation's most outspoken leftwing politicians.</p> <p>This has secured him a beloved place in the hearts of American liberals - especially his own Cleveland constituents. But it has also often earned him ridicule in the media, derision by Republicans and the ire of his own <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats\">Democratic party</a>'s establishment.</p> <p>Now, with the predictions of a possible Democratic election day landslide, Kucinich is still far from feeling vindicated as a vocal critic of modern America. Sitting in the Guardian's US election battle bus, Kucinich said a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> win would only mean something if he followed through with genuine leftwing policies.</p> <p>\"Obama, if he wins, is going to take a page from Franklin Roosevelt,\" he said, referring to the policies he wanted to see as an \"old time religion\" of New Deal-style 1930s massive government intervention in the economy.</p> <p>If Obama does win the White House it may be thanks to the huge voter-turnout drives in districts like Kucinich's. Cleveland sits in the battleground state of Ohio, one of the most valuable pieces of political turf in the election. No Republican president has ever won the White House without Ohio. If Obama can stop <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>'s campaign here it will effectively end his dreams of the presidency. But Kucinich is not assuming an Obama victory.</p> <p>\"Ohio is a state that can break your heart,\" he said. It certainly helped destroy the chances of Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004.</p> <p>But for the moment the signs look good. Obama has a small but seemingly solid lead in the polls. The voting problems that plagued the state in 2004 - and resulted in allegations that the result unfairly favoured the Republicans - have been tackled.</p> <p>Early voting in Obama-friendly areas like Cleveland and Columbus has been heavy. The economy, which appears to have single-handedly turned the election in Obama's favour, is still the most important issue to most voters.</p> <p>It seems to have overcome any lingering reluctance of many voters to put a cross next to the name of a black candidate for president. \"This is not a black and white election. Green is the colour everybody is worried about here,\" Kucinich said as he took the Guardian bus through Cleveland's streets on an impromptu tour of his home city.</p> <p>There is little doubt that no one knows Cleveland quite like Dennis Kucinich. Almost every street carried bright yellow yard signs that simply proclaim: \"Dennis!\" He still lives in the same modest suburban home he bought in 1971, sharing it with his English wife, Elizabeth, and three dogs rescued from the city pound.</p> <p>Kucinich was born in the city in 1946 as one of seven children of a working class couple. During his childhood he moved 21 times, bumping from cheap apartment to cheaper apartment, which the young Kucinich often had the task of finding. It was that tough upbringing which gave him his leftist political beliefs and also the thick skin to keep holding them in an America that has rarely been friendly to such a point of view. \"I've lived in cars,\" he said by way of explaining his immunity to attacks on his philosophy \"There's nothing that anybody can do to me.\"</p> <p>Kucinich fought his way into university and then threw himself into a political career, eventually becoming mayor in 1977 at just 31. A period in the political wilderness in the 1980s ended with him winning his current congressional seat in 1996. He quickly carved out a high profile name as one of America's most liberal senior politicians.</p> <p>He has pushed for dialogue with nations like Iran and Syria, tried to impeach President George Bush, been a vocal anti-war voice, opposed the recent bank bail-out and advocated creating a \"Department of Peace\". He ran for the presidency in 2004 and 2008 and though his candidacies never had much chance of success they gave publicity to views that are rarely seen in mainstream American politics.</p> <p>Or at least until now. Kucinich's has long slammed the culture of debt that grew up in the American economy. He has attacked Wall Street bonuses and the rising stock market and excessive greed as being bad for the American people and unsustainable. Such anti-corporate language earned him little but abuse from most politicians, even in his own party, who often dubbed him a socialist.</p> <p>Yet now, following a bail-out that Kucinich opposed, he has witnessed the Bush administration indulge in a massive part-nationalisation of America's financial system. \"Bush did something to the economy that Karl Marx never could have,\" he said.</p> <p>It does not give Kucinich much pleasure. Nor is it likely that the American media, or the Democratic party establishment, are likely to embrace his social democratic views even though they proved prescient. But it does mean that Ohio - led by hard hit cities like Kucinich's Cleveland - is standing on the brink of handing the White House to Obama.</p>",
  "<p>When Michelle Obama gets into trouble, it's because she's too warm, too strong, too real. If Cindy McCain is disliked, it's because she's too icy, too breakable, too fake. Obama offers the controversial 'fist bump' as a greeting; McCain has to wear a wrist brace because of a handshaking injury. </p> <p>The two candidates' wives couldn't be more different and the contrast between them has provided yet another media-friendly dimension to a presidential race that hardly needed added zest.</p> <p>While the Republicans have been running an 'Ordinary Joe' campaign, Cindy McCain wears Oscar de la Renta and five-carat diamond earrings. (Her net worth is a reported $100m; her income for 2007 was $4.2m.) In the week when Sarah Palin's campaign-funded designer trousseau made headlines, Michelle Obama went on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and, while extending her sympathy to Palin for the sartorial scrutiny she was experiencing, said she herself was wearing 'a J Crew ensemble' she'd bought online with her own money. (Michelle Obama's entire outfit can now be purchased in the J Crew sale for under $300.)</p> <p>Even with Hillary Clinton and Palin to suggest that the political landscape is more complicated for women now, these are still the questions that count for a prospective First Lady: What does she wear? How does she smile? Has she taken his name? Does she have a job?</p> <p>Cindy McCain is a first lady in the old mould - mould being the operative word. Standing just behind her husband at every stop on the campaign trail, she seems pale, remote, and stiff to the point of automation. 'Stepford' is a word that has been linked to her frequently; matters aren't helped when she appears not so much to have departed from a script, as blown a fuse. </p> <p>She said that Mother Teresa 'prevailed upon' her to adopt a Bangladeshi orphan with a cleft palate; it was later discovered that Mother Teresa was not there when McCain visited the orphanage. She said she'd been to Rwanda during the genocide; it turned out she'd been to Zaire after the violence had ended and looked over the border. </p> <p>A serious addiction to prescription painkillers, that led her to steal from her own charity and cause people who had helped her to lose their jobs, has been turned into a recovery success story. Cindy, according to a friend of the McCains, would 'walk on broken glass barefoot' if it would help her husband in his campaign - virtually the same words Jackie Kennedy used about her successor, Lady Bird Johnson.</p> <p>Michelle Obama, on the other hand, has been quick to tell us about her husband's morning breath and his failure to take out the rubbish. Earlier this year, she was considered an unpredictable, potentially dangerous factor in the campaign ('Will Michelle Obama Hurt Barack?' was a question asked on the cover of Time magazine last summer). Right wingers labelled the fist bump she exchanged with her husband at the Democratic National Convention a 'terrorist fist jab'. She said she was proud of her country for the first time, and that went down as profoundly unpatriotic. Her domestic anecdotes were having a questionable effect on his popularity. Yet she has turned this tricky reputation around, campaigning on her husband's behalf when he visited his dying grandmother in Hawaii, and overtaking her Republican counterpart in every opinion poll. </p> <p>Most important, she has done more than 'humanise' the candidate, as is traditional: she has actively bolstered his identity in the public imagination. He is a mixed-race half-Kenyan who was brought up in Hawaii and needed to seem less foreign to voters; she is an African American who grew up on the South Side of Chicago, then went to Princeton and Harvard and became a lawyer.</p> <p>These women's plans for the future are as distinct from each other as their performances on the campaign trail would suggest. Cindy McCain, who dislikes Washington, has suggested she would, as First Lady, attempt to emulate Princess Diana - she supports some of the same charities, and is keen to devote herself further to global philanthropy, a full-time prospect she and her husband have disagreed about in public. </p> <p>Michelle Obama, who has focused on addressing working women, has no illusions about keeping the high-powered hospital executive job she's scaled down in order to get her husband elected. Careful not to seem like another Hillary in the East Wing, she voices modest hopes. 'When people ask, \"what kind of First Lady will you be?\",' she recently told Vanity Fair, 'I'm going to try, in all this, to be honest, hopefully funny and share important parts of me with people, hopefully in a way that will help them think about their lives and avoid the mistakes we may have made in our lifetime.'</p>",
  "<p>When the balaclava-clad paramilitary police officer pulled back a blanket covering the corpse, a group of women wailed, shielding their babies' eyes. The security guard, whose body had been left outside the 4/9 Minimart in Villa Foresta on the edge of Tijuana, had been shot repeatedly at point-blank range with what appeared to be a semi-automatic weapon, his face and chest grated by gunfire into something more like a raw carcass on a hook. </p> <p>This was body number six last Monday night, and the sixth of what would become a total of 15 people murdered during less than 72 hours in this frontier city that acts as a portal from Mexico to California and vice versa. This is the front line in the 'narco-war' - savage, sanguine and sudden - that drug cartels are waging between each other and with the authorities. The war has claimed some 2,700 lives this year, and more than 6,000 since December 2006, when President Felipe Calder\u00f3n launched Mexico's first serious offensive against the cartels who have traded for decades under a measure of government protection.</p> <p>The battle has been fought mainly along the 2,100-mile border between the United States and Mexico, the world's busiest frontier. As the body count has increased, so has the brutality of the killing. Corpses have been found severely tortured or decapitated, castrated, dipped in sulphuric acid or with their tongues cut out. </p> <p>Dr Hiram Mu\u00f1oz, chief forensic medical expert assigned to the homicide department in Tijuana, told The Observer how 'each different mutilation leaves a clear message. They have become a kind of folk tradition. If the tongue is cut out, it means they talked too much. A man who sneaked on someone else has his finger cut off and maybe put in his mouth. If you are castrated, you may have slept with the woman of another man. Decapitation is another thing: it is simply a statement of power, a warning to all. The difference is that in normal times the dead were \"disappeared\" or dumped in the desert. Now, they are displayed for all to see.' </p> <p>Last month 13 bodies with their tongues cut out were found across the road from the Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas secondary school. The principal, Miguel Angel Gonz\u00e1lez Tovar, said: 'It was terrifying, the children were terrified, the staff were terrified. And now we had to suspend some classes after this last warning. They gave me CCTV, but that does not work. They gave me an alarm button, but that is broken. We try to teach here, but we cannot be isolated from what is going on outside.' The illustrated project on the wall of one classroom was about global warming and gave guidance on what to do in a flood or hurricane. </p> <p>The new army-imposed chief of police in Tijuana, Lieutenant-Colonel Juli\u00e1n Leyzaola, talks of 'social terrorism' by the narcos, referring specifically to a threat last Tuesday that, if Marines did not leave town, the narco gangs would kidnap and kill schoolchildren. </p> <p>'All I can do is to increase a police profile in the community and schools, calm people down to avert the kind of social psychosis the narcos want to generate, physical presence to reassure people and intelligence to fight the criminals themselves', said Leyzaola. </p> <p>The war has also struck deep into the heart of Mexico, with macabre executions as far south as Chiapas. The magazine Proceso published a cover photograph of the country's entire political and military leadership under the headline 'Impotence', and concluded that 'the narco is now a national structure'. The leading campaigner against the drug cartels in Tijuana, Victor Clark Alfaro, talked last week about 'a war against society itself, at every level of life, school and community, with violence on the streets and even more sinister movements behind that violence, to create psychosis in society, and criminalise the economy'. </p> <p>The war has also spread into the US, with 135 arrests last month in a swoop against Mexican cartel operatives. </p> <p>The appalling and escalating level of violence is not only a response to Mexico's tardy counter-offensive against the drug gangs, but a symptom of fragmentation among the drug cartels themselves. </p> <p>Last week's bloodbath in Tijuana - taking the year's death toll for this city towards 600 - followed the arrest last Saturday of Eduardo Arellano F\u00e9lix, known better by his 'nom de narco' El Doctor - the last remaining fugitive of five brothers who ran Mexico's oldest, but now severely damaged, cartel. On Wednesday, the US State Department lodged a request for Arellano's extradition for trial in the United States, where he has been among the most wanted drug traffickers. </p> <p>That dramatic swoop on a Saturday afternoon targeted an Art Deco mansion in the upscale Misiones del Pedregal suburb. A deafening salvo of fire was aimed at the villa in what was presumed to be yet another shoot-out. The next day it was shown to have been the taking of Mexico's second most wanted drug lord into custody. He arrived - white-bearded and apparently dazed - for his ritual handcuffed appearance for television to join one of his surviving brothers, Javier, in the high-security Altiplano jail. </p> <p>Authorities on both sides of the border hailed the arrest as a triumph, the US Drug Enforcement Administration calling it the 'final demise' of the cartel founded by Mexico's first drug lord, Angel F\u00e9lix Gallardo, but run by the Arellano brothers since he was jailed in 1989. </p> <p>Others were slower to celebrate. The state of Baja California's new public prosecutor, Rommel Moreno Manjarrez said: 'We hope to be seeing the fall of the Arellano cartel. But we have no illusions that one cartel's misfortune is another's opportunity, and that rivals will be watching this situation in their own way. We are trying to see how this will play out and to battle against whatever moves are made. </p> <p>'We have had a serious problem of police corruption in the past, but are trying to purge this corruption from our forces, and are now able to fight this battle seriously, with the DEA helping in many ways, and with backing from our own government, which is different from the old political situation.' </p> <p>Cocaine trafficking from South America into the US (and much of Europe), and trafficking in Mexican-produced heroin and methamphetamine, became a Mexican near-monopoly during the 1990s, operated by four cartels, each controlling one of four main 'plazas', or routes into the US. </p> <p>The Texan sector belonged to the 'Gulf cartel' and its military wing, Los Zetas, comprised of former crack Mexican troops. A central passage through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez was terrain dominated by the Ju\u00e1rez cartel and the giant plaza between Tijuana and California by the Arellano brothers and their sister Eneida who, the authorities presume, will assume command of the clan. </p> <p>But a fourth, unspecified, central-western plaza was run by the Alianza de Sangre (Alliance of Blood), or Sinaloa cartel, from the Pacific state of that name, way south of the border, where most of the other big traffickers also originate. This cartel was founded and is led by Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n, who split from Gallardo to rival him, was jailed in 1993, but dramatically escaped in 2001 and is now a fugitive and something of a narco folk hero. Guzm\u00e1n used the 2006 government offensive to lay claim to the entire border. The war that rages in Tijuana is largely between his rebels and those loyal to the Arellano family. Moreno says that an alliance forged in jail between the Sinaloa and Ju\u00e1rez cartels is also 'entirely finished', generating further chaos, and Sinaloa is taking on the Gulf cartel's Zetos with a trained army of its own, Los Negros (the Men in Black). </p> <p>Amid the carnage, a journey with three young women from the police forensic team is a harrowing experience. On the outskirts of Tijuana, another corpse has been found, visible by the green light of a petrol station. The windscreen of the victim's Ford Explorer (with California plates) is pitted with three bullet holes, and he seems to have made a run into the street, followed by 25 further shots. </p> <p>The scene of the next slaughter is the 9/4 minimart in Villa Foresta, where a blanket covers the remains of the security guard, with two more dead inside. There is wild sobbing from the women as the bullet-sprayed body outside is revealed, and those inside the store are brought out on stretchers and loaded into the white forensic department truck now carrying five dead bodies. </p> <p>The shop, it seems, was a stash for drugs being loaded for export in two presumed clavos (nails - the word used here for a car carrying drugs) intended to join the 65,000 that cross from Tijuana into San Diego every day, which the police in time tow away. </p> <p>Meanwhile heavy-set men arrive to look on from a slight distance, embracing each other in a way that suggests burdensome comradeship and solace, but little sadness. </p> <p>Tijuana's residents are struggling, with a remarkable degree of success, to lead a normal life. A recent study among local drug addicts shows an increase from 5,000 outlets and crack houses in 2004 to 20,000 now, and an estimated 200,000 young people in a burgeoning city of three million seriously addicted to hard drugs. Friday's newspapers reported yet another vast haul by the American authorities of 90lb of cocaine, crossing Tijuana's border to San Diego in a car driven by a Mexican burro, or mule. </p> <p>But the city teems with effervescent life for all the 'psychosis' the narcos wreak. The crowds of American tourists have vanished from the famous Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n, so the souvenir business is in trouble. And with the formerly flashy narcos now lying low, Tijuana's famous brothels and strip clubs are empty of all but the worst types, the girls gyrating mainly with one another. </p> <p>But like every other bar, the S\u00f3tano Suizo pub was heaving last Sunday (while Eduardo F\u00e9lix Arellano was airborne, handcuffed), for the climactic football match of the season Mexicans call 'El Cl\u00e1sico' between Club Am\u00e9rica of Mexico City and Chivas of Guadalajara. The teams unleash attack after attack in a tremendous game-to-the-death with Chivas winning 2-1.</p> <p>On Friday, slightly surreally given the week's murders, celebrations were being prepared for yesterday's Day of the Dead, an ancient rite inherited from Mexican tradition, entwining Roman Catholicism with Aztec lore of the 'Black Sun', which illuminates the underworld.</p> <p>The borderland remains a strong, exciting and potent place, in which the vast majority of people live and strive honestly. This frontier is too often defined, as Professor Tony Payan of El Paso university points out in an excellent book on the borderline, not by the people who live, flock to and work here, but by whatever is polemically useful to Washington. From there, argues Payan, successive administrations have illogically and disastrously entwined their failed border 'war on drugs' with the entirely separate 'wars' on undocumented immigration and terrorism. </p> <p>There is a strong sense that the region is paying the price for other people's greed. 'We are,' says Eligio Montes, police commander of Rosarito Beach, south of Tijuana, 'a cultural sandwich here on the border. And now we're squeezed between narcos from Sinaloa and Americans taking drugs.' </p> <p>My companion reporter, Jorge Fregosa, ends another rollercoaster drive on Thursday (to catch the army remove hand grenades from a blue plastic bin in a side street) by saying: 'This is my city, my country and that is my flag' - and he opens the sunroof the better to see it fly, defiantly vast, with its eagle, cactus, snake and legend, in the breeze and in America's face, at the border. </p> <p>'And every time they kill someone,' says Fregosa, who has seen that happen hundreds of times this year, 'it hurts me. because it hurts the place I love. The border pays the price, and now we are paying a higher price than ever.'</p> <h2>War on drugs</h2> <p><strong>December 2006</strong><br>A new federal police force is created to tackle drugs cartels; thousands of troops are deployed as part of a major anti-drug trafficking drive.</p> <p><strong>2008 </strong><br>Drug-related killings soar.

  "<p>It's been the biggest fashion story of the year and it's had nothing to do with harem pants, the coat versus the cape, or the alluring comeback of the brogue. An industry not known for its crises of confidence has been forced to ask itself some uncomfortable questions. Might there be something nearing apartheid inside the pages of the glossy magazines and on the runways of the international designer collections? Is fashion racist? </p> <p>The debate - some say long overdue - would not have been kick-started without a woman called Bethann Hardison. The first black saleswoman in the Garment District of New York in the Sixties and a runway model in the Seventies, she spent the Eighties and Nineties as one of the few black women with her own modelling agency (for black and white clients). She's so celebrated in the business that she's known mostly by her first name only, like Naomi and Iman, to each of whom she also happens to be a long-time confidante and mentor. </p> <p>Over the past 14 months she's held campaign meetings in New York to speak out about a subject that has been largely taboo in the fashion industry. These are protest groups like no other - a cross between a rumbustious church service and the coolest party you have ever been to. Here, the likes of Naomi Campbell, Liya Kebede, Iman, Tyson Beckford and Veronica Webb squeeze into a room with some of the fashion world's biggest players such as Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, editor-at-large of American Vogue and designer Vera Wang, as well as casting agents, stylists and representatives from the modelling agencies. </p> <p>At each meeting, Hardison sits at the front and beckons people she knows to stand up and speak. 'I knew I could make things happen,' she says. 'I knew I could make the rest of the industry feel self-conscious about what was going on.' Over the months her audiences revealed a fashion white-out - design houses that hadn't used a black model for a decade; issue after issue of American Vogue without a single black model on the fashion pages. Casting agents who stipulate 'No ethnics' this season. Magazine editors who say black covers don't sell. Caption writers who get the few black models who are successful mixed up. Designers who, out of a total of 30 models, use only two who are black because, 'If it's more than two it becomes a Black Thing'. Black models paid less than their white counterparts. As Iman said at one of the early groups: 'In any other industry it would be racism and you'd be taken to court for it.'</p> <p>Hardison had actually sold her agency and stepped out of fashion, preferring, she says, to lie in a hammock in Mexico and dance salsa with pretty skinny Latino boys. (She is, it swiftly transpires, not a typical sixtysomething. She won't tell me her exact age. 'Not even my doctor knows that!' she hoots.) It was Naomi Campbell who persuaded her to come out of retirement to organise the events. 'Every couple of months she'd ring me and say, \"There are no black girls out there. You've got to do something!\"' </p> <p>Hardison was in a unique position. She'd retired, which meant she had nothing to gain financially. She knew everyone. She was respected and well liked in a business renowned for being fickle and as ingrained with ego and jealousy as a designer logo on a leather handbag. Eventually she decided to act. She emailed Iman. 'Did you realise that, over the past decade, black models have been reduced to a category? Call me.'</p> <p>We sit in her small apartment near Bryant Park in New York, a short walk from the Garment District where she started out working for a button company. Paintings, mostly of black women, line the walls; there's a large framed poster from Andy Warhol's American Indian Series. She is, she tells me, exhausted. Something to do with the fact that yesterday she held another campaign meeting, and that she's fasting because it is the month of Ramadan. </p> <p>What irks her most about the lack of diversity on the catwalks is the fact that 'we'd had it before and it had disappeared'. In the late 70s and early 80s, she recalls, on the back of the black civil-rights movement, catwalks and magazines were often more diverse than they are now; black models were the stars.</p> <p>'Once you've climbed to the top of the mountain you don't expect to be back at the bottom again. It's like once you've seen Paris it's hard to go back to the farm. We had been there. We had achieved all of this' - she sits up straighter, tilting her chin imperiously and I catch a glimpse of how arresting she must have been as a 20-something woman striding down a runway for Oscar de la Renta or Halston - 'and we'd disappeared'.</p> <p>Casual observers might wonder why this issue is important, why anyone cares who's wearing a \u00a32,500 coat in a magazine fashion spread or on a catwalk since most of us will never be able to afford it anyway. According to Hardison: 'Fashion should be a reflection of society. I want my industry to be as modern as the next one. And my industry is the least modern of them all. Fashion isn't just about the way a dress moves.' The concern is that a generation of girls, both black and white, will grow up thinking there is only one - white - benchmark for beauty.</p> <p>It seems astonishing to think that, in two days' time, America may elect its first black president, but the editor of a glossy magazine might still think twice about putting a beautiful black woman on the front cover. Or even, indeed, on the inside pages, thanks to the current fascination with celebrity that means a famous person (usually a white, fake-tanned one) bags the cover slot. Thus the number of new, well-known black or Asian models has shrunk to a handful: Jourdan Dunn, Chanel Iman, Sessilee Lopez, Georgie Badiel. On Forbes magazine's 2007 list of the 15 top-earning models, only one - Liya Kebede - was black.</p> <p>Trying to work out why fashion seems to have gone backwards on diversity is complex.</p> <p>Everyone blames everyone else - model agencies blame casting directors, magazine editors blame readers, designers blame model agencies. The reasons range from the aesthetic to the more insidious.</p> <p>'I don't think in terms of black and white,' stylist Katie Grand tells me. 'I just think about who is going to look best in the clothes.' The fashion designer Katharine Hamnett claims to be baffled by the situation. 'The strange thing is that Caucasian girls actually got the short straw. Very few of them are model material. Black girls and Indian girls have far better faces and far better figures than white girls, period. I remember taking my kids to India and looking out of the bus window and saying, \"My God, this is like a model casting\". Why white girls remain so popular is a mystery to me, whether it's because consumers are mostly white, or aspire to be white, I don't know.'</p> <p>In America, where 30 per cent of the population is non-white and where black women spend a colossal $20 billion on fashion and cosmetics, the issue is particularly sensitive. Other American media, including some hit television dramas, reflect a society that is racially mixed, but the fashion industry remains as pale as a partially cooked chicken drumstick. American Vogue, with a readership of two million, has, in particular been criticised for its scarcity of black images.</p> <p>'We still have reactionary forces in this country,' says Veronica Webb, one of the most successful black American models in the Eighties and the first to land a major cosmetics contract for Revlon. 'And they are part of our power base. It's our national ailment. To be told \"no\" simply because of your colour means you are screwed ... And it wasn't even so bad for me because I am very mixed - part black, part African, part Latino.' </p> <p>Nevertheless she recalls being turned down for a job for a leading French design house. 'The photographer, who was a friend, told me the client didn't want their accessories to become status symbols in the black community.'</p> <p>I repeat this story to other black commentators in the industry and it's so typical they don't even sound surprised. Former model Beverly Bond has set up a group for black teenage girls called 'Black Girls Rock', an attempt to attach a slogan to the protest in the same way that 'Black is Beautiful' did in the Seventies. 'I've been to auditions where they automatically turn away the black girls without even looking at their books. It's racist. Imagine them behaving that way if I went to a job interview. It's amazing how far behind the fashion world is and how they can get away with being so blatant about it.'</p> <p>She's given up modelling and become a well-known DJ instead. 'In the end black models get disheartened by it. No matter how hot you look, you are never going to be hot enough.'</p> <p>In July, no doubt partly because of Bethann Hardison's campaign, Italian Vogue published what they called 'a black issue'. Every page of editorial was devoted to black beauty (while the advertising remained almost universally white). It included many of the best black models of the past 30 years, from ground-breakers like Pat Cleveland to Jourdan Dunn, said to be the new Naomi Campbell. (It seems there's little chance of there being room for two very successful black models at the same time.) The result was dazzling, although the website Gawker noted wryly: 'Never has the racism issue looked so stunning.'</p> <p>For the first time in its history the magazine sold out, helped by a campaign on Facebook by black readers starved of the black image for long enough. The issue made newspaper headlines on both sides of the Atlantic. Commentators said it showed, finally, that the black image could sell. Critics noted that the majority of the models were pale-skinned, their hair often slicked back or hidden in a turban. True, black women don't all look the same - and thinking they do is part of the problem - but there were few images of darker skin and natural afro hair. </p> <p>With a circulation of 145,000, Italian Vogue's readership is edgy and niche. Editor Franca Sozzani can afford to take risks. Rivals may have sat up and taken notice but most probably thought, 'Fabulous publicity. I wish I'd thought of that!' And then carried on as before.</p> <p>Some felt that it was too little too late. 'There's nothing I like more than to see beautiful black people,' says Rebecca Carroll, author of Sugar in the Raw, about black teenage girls in America, 'but it felt a bit like black history month - \"Now we've done it we don't have to worry about it again\".' Black stylist and fashion editor Edward Enninful disagrees. He worked on the issue: 'I'd love it if fashion was 50/50 between black and white. But you have to think in terms of baby steps. In the end little drops make an ocean.'</p> <p>Whenever designers and stylists enter the debate many talk about the cyclical nature of the business and how trends come and go. However, even if this is the case, change is achingly slow. Katie Grand worked on five shows last season and struggled to find the quality of black models she wanted. 'I think the agencies could do more,' she says. 'I saw every girl but there were very few black girls.' At Louis Vuitton, out of a total of 54 models, she used only four that were black. </p> <p>At the recent collections in September Chanel still had no black models; nor did Yohji Yamamoto, Giorgio Armani, Marni or Jil Sander. </p> <p>Balenciaga, Gucci, Christian Lacroix and Prada had one each. The vast majority used just two or three (at least, everyone said, it was better than last year) although many were only seen on the runway once. Jean Paul Gaultier and Vivienne Westwood, famously fans of a mixed cabine, broke through the 20 per cent ceiling. </p> <p>One up-and-coming designer, Sophie Theallet, stood out - her whole show was made up of only black models. It was a success but, as she tells me: 'I told nobody beforehand - only my husband and the people closest to me at work. It was too risky. I didn't want anyone telling me it was not a good idea.' And this in a spring/summer collection when, as Bethann Hardison points out, black models traditionally do much better. 'The bright colours against the dark skin ...' she says, rolling her eyes. When she was an agent she used to ring up the design houses and say: 'You know we do wear clothes in winter time?'</p> <p>People in the fashion and media industry who know Bethann describe her as an icon. Admittedly fashion has its fair share of luvviness, but watch her at her meetings and the affection people feel for her is obvious. Both inspiring and outspoken without being self-righteous, she's able to rouse and provoke in equal measure, poking fun at a business that she clearly loves but one which takes itself rather too seriously at times. </p> <p>However, her background had little to do with designer shops on Madison Avenue. Hardison's father, a practising Muslim, was a supervisor in the local housing authority. After her parents separated she was looked after by her mother and grandmother who were domestics in Brooklyn. 'You've got to leave Brooklyn,' she says, 'to be proud of where you come from.' Her mother loved the local bar scene, dancing and dressing up - 'Though in those days, the Fifties, everybody dressed in the same silhouette, whether they were black or white.' </p> <p>Hardison fell pregnant at the age of 18 - 'I had never had sex before and I got pregnant on the first time, which is the worst thing in the world.' When her baby son, Kadeem, was small, her mother and grandmother looked after him (he grew up to become a successful actor, based in Los Angeles) and for a while she had a mixture of jobs working at a telephone company and in a prison before she found a position in a firm that made hand-painted buttons for design houses.</p> <p>She'd inherited her mother's sense of style. 'That first day I wore a white straw hat, a one-off white suit, slingback shoes. The owner was worried I'd get covered in paint so he decided I could be the one to take the buttons to the designers.' It would be true to say she never looked back. Hardison worked her way up through an industry that back then was focused on a few streets in midtown Manhattan. She was an assistant for a dress company, which meant she was secretary, receptionist and book-keeper. Finally two Jewish women who ran a salon allowed her to be the first black saleswoman in the Garment District. The idea of a white woman with money to spend being shown the collection in the showroom by a black woman was unheard of.</p> <p>Hardison's hair was cropped short, as it is now. She was also very skinny. 'Boy was I skinny! Big eyes. I looked like I was from Biafra.' Her unusual look came to the attention of some of the designers she met at work. 'I wasn't a pretty girl but there was something about me that attracted them.' </p> <p>Her debut as a model was in the early Seventies for a designer called Chester Weinberg. The audience, made up of industry buyers, was wholly white. 'They looked stunned. I looked like a little African girl. There were a few other girls of colour but they had a sort of bounce about them. I was just straight.' By the third outfit the uproar was so loud, she could barely get to the end of the room. 'I was dying inside. I wanted to walk right through the door onto the subway and go home. But somehow I kept my head up and it became a point of defiance. I wouldn't let them see how much they hurt me. That became my style. They had never seen anyone who looked like me but that defiance changed the way models could look.'</p> <p>It wasn't long before black models were in demand. 'They called us the black stallions. Black or white it didn't matter. It was a great time because it was so creative and stylish and bohemian. You didn't have to have lots of money to be at the party.' Sensibly - and Hardison, you come to realise, has a very sensible head on those shoulders - she never gave up her day job. By this time she was working as a design assistant. She knew everyone from the Studio 54 crowd to Truman Capote, Jerry Hall to Woody Allen, but, as she says: 'There wasn't a lot of bullcrap then. All you had to do was have interesting dinner-party conversation.'</p> <p>A man once told her she was too busy to be committed to a relationship and, though she was married twice, neither marriage lasted long. In the Eighties she decided to start her own modelling agency. She found premises in the then unfashionable SoHo area of New York. 'As a black businesswoman you can't believe anyone is taking you seriously because you have no one before you who has done what you are doing. It's like walking down the Yellow Brick Road before it's been laid.' She would run the agency for 21 years and set up a pressure group called Black Girls' Coalition with Iman. By the time she sold up there may not have been parity between white and black models but she imagined she'd done enough.</p> <p>The industry changed with the influx of Eastern-European models. Bewitching-looking women: tall, translucent, angular, with flinty cheekbones and piercing eyes. 'They flooded the market,' says Carole White, who owns Premier Model Management. 'They are beautiful, but it is a bland beauty. It's a certain look. We can all spot it.' As a reaction to the reign of the supermodels, labels like Jil Sander and Prada wanted anonymous faces. 'It was almost as though they were revolted by what they had created,' says Michael Gross, the author of Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women. According to Hardison: 'The model was reduced to a coathanger.' </p> <p>Of 200 models on White's books, only seven are black or Asian women and she says they have to work twice as hard to get the jobs. White thinks that fashion has become dominated by a white aesthetic that goes beyond the designers. 'Photographers used to be apprenticed for five years. They would learn about lighting and printing,' she explains. 'The thing is that now they probably use digital cameras and don't know how to light a black girl. It's the same with make-up artists. Black make-up artists like Pat McGrath work magic on white models but you don't see it the other way around. It's probably ignorance, and they are probably frightened. They just don't know how to do it.' </p> <p>There is an unspoken presumption that white readers want white models, white women only want to see an image of themselves on the catwalks. It's what academics call 'the white hegemony' and it's so casual if you're white you don't even notice it. But might the pundits be talking down to their consumers?</p> <p>'Editors say customers won't have it, it won't sell,' says Barbara Summers, a black model in the Seventies and the author of Black and Beautiful and Open the Unusual Door. 'But it's self-defeating. They're projecting their own failure and using black people to make the excuse. It's just cowardice. The irony is that the industry is shrinking in the current financial crisis. It can't grow again if it stays stuck in these past ideas. You can't expand your customer base if you only make products for white girls.' </p> <p>The result, according to Rebecca Carroll, is black teenage girls growing up thinking that they're not admired, a sense that goes beyond what they see in the mirror. 'It's painful,' she says. 'No one likes to be excluded and they grow up thinking they don't exist, therefore people don't care.'</p> <p>Even if one goes along with the view that Italian Vogue was, as Enninful says, 'historic and monumental', look through this month's bunch of British monthly glossies and you'd be hard pressed to find any black images. Editors often maintain that the number of black models they include proportionately matches the population. However, in this month's British glossies, the main fashion spreads are universally white. </p> <p>When you do see black models in magazines the same tropes are repeated again and again, says Zoe Whitley. She is a curator and visiting fellow at Sussex University, whose MA thesis was about blackness in Vogue. In mainstream magazines there is traditionally a proliferation of leopard-print and other animalistic symbols. Certain postures are popular - crawling, leaping in the air and smiling. There are lots of accessories and jewellery and colours that deliberately show up the contrast between fabric and skin - vivid reds, turquoise, white. 'The stories can be stunning,' says Whitley, 'but you don't often get a sense that you'd see a black model in a story about tweed, or a muted palette.' </p> <p>The alternative is to create an atmosphere of exoticism by putting a white model in a foreign environment like an African country or India. 'She becomes exotic and they don't even have to resort to using a black model.'</p> <p>Whitley has a theory that, when a black image is used on the front of a glossy magazine it is often in February, traditionally the lowest-selling month anyway. 'The poor sales become a self-fulfilling prophesy.' As a young woman growing up in Washington and Los Angeles, her family would rush out to buy any magazine with a black person on the front. They imagined they could boost sales single-handed.</p> <p>The lack of black images prompts some commentators to wonder whether magazines are interested in black readers at all. Fashion is a business and like all businesses it goes where it thinks the money is. 'This is a commercial industry,' says Michael Gross, 'run by a bunch of old people. Their job is not to change the world, it is to sell frocks. It's not racism. It's not even unconscious racism. It's an utter cluelessness about the real world.'</p> <p>There is a view, though, that if Senator Barack Obama does win on Tuesday, the response will be profound, even on cosseted, inward-looking Planet Fashion. Michelle Obama has wowed the industry with her fashion instincts. She's already reinvented the way a potential First Lady can dress. She might soon be the most sought-after woman on any glossy magazine front cover anywhere in the world. True, she's not a model but it could mark a sea change. 'It will be a wake-up call,' says Gross. 'The reaction in the fashion business will be a blatant and almost laughable attempt to catch up. Such is this craven industry and such is the way they behave.'</p>",

With an annual fee of $1,000 (\u00a3600), a credit limit of $50,000 (\u00a330,000) and round-the-clock access to a personal card 'manager', it will be launched in two weeks' time and aimed at recession-proof multi-millionaires. </p> <p>The number of cards issued will be strictly limited to just 1,000 at a rate of 30 each month. Kazkommertsbank's head of international payments systems, Alla Voyakina, has said the bank intends to target 'the best VIP customers'. According to recent figures, there are an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Kazakhstan's population of 16 million and the number is growing. </p> <p>The last Soviet republic to declare independence, in 1991, the country boasts abundant supplies of minerals and fossil fuels. It aims to be the world's leading exporter of uranium by 2010. It also produces diamonds.</p> <p>The bank has said that the embedded diamond is only a 'design feature' to demonstrate the status of the customer. It has been tested thoroughly to ensure it will fit into cash machines and point-of-sales slots. 'Rich people can afford to have such cards,' Voyakina told the Financial Times. 'It's a question of prestige to have them in your wallet.'</p>",
  "<p>The last time I was in a room with Leonardo DiCaprio was in 2001. It was his kitchen, and I was interviewing his then girlfriend, Brazilian gorgeousness Gisele B\u00fcndchen. Her Yorkshire terrier was yapping and she was talking non-stop in a dizzying way, with demanding eyes, lavish hair. She was warm, volatile and had a sense of entitlement. Leo was withdrawn, quiet and perhaps a little lost, chopping vegetables meticulously in the kitchen. He was making food to take over to a friend's house and he kept saying, 'Baby, we're late.' But Baby carried on talking and demanding empanadas. Gisele and the yorkie were going crazy for the tasty meaty morsels. Leo just kept chopping vegetables. Eventually, Gisele drove me home. Joni Mitchell's 'California' was playing, and we sang along. She told me Leo didn't do karaoke, but apart from that, life with him was great. But it didn't surprise me when they split up. It seemed as if they had nothing in common.</p> <p>Seven years on I'm in another room with DiCaprio, a slightly smoky suite at the Beverly Wilshire, where he's promoting Body of Lies, Ridley Scott's hard-hitting terrorists-versus-CIA movie. He's in a battered grey T-shirt and jeans, and though he's 6ft 1in he looks taller - perhaps because he's long limbed, perhaps because one expects movie stars to be Tom Cruise-sized. He's not as chunky as the look he adopted for Gangs of New York, where he gained 30lb, but he's still powerful looking. He appears both older and younger than his 33 years. His eyes are penetrating; he's polite and smiling, but guarded, in a subtle way - there's no hostility here. </p> <p>Body of Lies reunites DiCaprio with Russell Crowe. The last time they appeared together was in The Quick and the Dead, when DiCaprio was only 20. This was the pre-Titanic age, when he was known for sensitive, artsy portrayals - as a retarded boy in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and being beaten up by his cruel stepfather, Robert DeNiro, in This Boy's Life. 'And he [Russell] had just done Romper Stomper, so we were both very wet behind the ears,' says DiCaprio. 'We were handpicked as two people who had done interesting performances that year. It was our first encounter in a big-budget film. </p> <p>Russell was very cool to me back then, and supportive of me as a young actor. After all these years he's still the same guy. He's carved out a fantastic career for himself.'</p> <p>He describes Crowe as one of the most committed and powerful actors of his generation. Really, I say, I thought that was you. He rocks back in his chair and laughs. 'Well, you know, people don't say that sort of thing about themselves.' He may be giggling, but part of him knows it's the truth. DiCaprio has graduated into a heavyweight. A meticulous performance as the obsessive-compulsive Howard Hughes in Scorsese's The Aviator earned him a second Oscar nomination (the first came for Gilbert Grape), while his roles for the same director in Gangs of New York and The Departed brought gravitas and kudos. His third Oscar nomination was for Blood Diamond, which he considers a movie that changed things: people are now more aware of conflict diamonds, he says.</p> <p>So was the dynamic between you and Crowe the same, I ask. Did he still seem like a mentor? Could he be supportive in the same way? In the film, Crowe and DiCaprio are on the same side but at loggerheads with each other, and the tension is fascinating. </p> <p>'It was strange that it hadn't changed. It was just like walking into a room 15 years later, even though a lot of things have happened to both of us, and a lot of changes have gone on in the world. But we have both developed as actors, we both have more experience under our belts, and there was a different way in which we conversed in that period and now - in terms of arguing our characters' points back and forth. I don't think we did that back then,' he says. 'Not that we didn't take it seriously, but we never had the responsibility we do now. So yes, I noticed the difference in that regard, for sure. I knew he was going to be like that because you can see it up there in the screen in all the work he does. He is very committed.'</p> <p>He uses the word committed as if it were the highest accolade. The earlier DiCaprio was already thoughtful, hypersensitive even, but through taking risks in lower-budget movies such as The Beach and Blood Diamond, and making his own eco statement in The 11th Hour, he gets to earn the moniker 'very committed', too. Certainly in Body of Lies there is no room for a lightweight. It was a long, tough shoot, mostly in the desert, and involved several months in Morocco, standing in for Jordan. </p> <p>'I had a very hard shoot, very rough. I've done a lot of action sequences before, but this is a Ridley Scott movie. You are always moving locations at lightning speed. At any given second Ridley would come in and say, \"I want a helicopter to come in and shoot two missiles and I want that to be on camera and I want to have a surveillance camera 2,000ft in the air shooting on top of your head.\" At some points you really don't know what's going to happen. It's a huge adrenaline rush as an actor because you have to be prepared dramatically to have any given scene changed at any moment. It makes you trust your instincts more. It makes you delve deep into yourself. The better you know your character the better you know how he would react in any scenario, and Ridley will throw curveballs constantly. He is editing seven different cameras at the same time and then he'll say, \"I don't believe that. I don't care how much we've talked about this scene, it's not coming across, so I'm going to change everything.\" He's a very run-and-gun director. He likes to keep up the pace of a film unlike any director I've met. You'd better be prepared for anything. Someone like Scorsese, I suppose, is a lot more meticulous in the way he sets things up. He's very specific and takes a lot of time with each angle.'</p> <p>The pace of the film is unyielding; there's a scene at the end, when he's being tortured, where I could hardly breathe. 'Good,' he exclaims. 'I had a problem with that scene, so I'm glad it worked for you.'</p> <p>But it's so graphic, so real, I couldn't finish looking at it.</p> <p>'It was a pivotal point in the whole movie,' he says. 'It was make or break. If that scene didn't work the movie couldn't sustain itself. We needed to make it important, pertinent and controversial. I spoke to ex-heads of the CIA about what my character would be doing and how he would be handling himself. Because so much hinged on it I almost had a physical breakdown at the end of it. So a lot of what you see on the film is my breaking point. I physically collapsed for a few days after that. I got sick because of the intensity of it.'</p> <p>One of the themes of the movie is truth: who you trust and who you lie to. So, who would he lie to, and why? 'Intrinsically, an organisation like the CIA relies on secrecy. It is about covert operations, so we're doing a movie about modern-day CIA operations and practices. I think we got as close as we could get to how the US operates in this war on terror.'</p> <p>He makes no attempt to answer this question as a personal one. His answer is long and articulate, and difficult to interrupt. He seems to be saying that while you can't trust terrorists, you can't trust Americans either. </p> <p>'That is very symbolic of the truth. You have this character that is in a deceitful world, trying to catch the enemy that he could never trust. But it is a dirty, ugly war. He's trying to hold on to a semblance of morality and a belief in his country while his country is letting him down, and ironically he's starting to trust people who are - while not exactly the enemy - not the people he's beholden to. You have to start thinking out of the box. He starts to question his patriotism, what he stands for morally. This character is not somebody who is either good or bad. He is trying to hold on to a certain belief system that is lost.'</p> <p>And then you realise that DiCaprio probably is talking about himself. When you ask him about Bush or Palin he is unequivocal. His anti-Palin rants are legendary. He says simply, 'I hope that Barack Obama wins because I haven't been happy with the last eight years, and that has been reflected in the polls. It is no secret that the Bush administration and the way they handled not only the war on terror but everything else has only a 10 per cent approval rating. So yes, I can only hope for Barack Obama; for a brilliant mind to come in and change everything. It is a scary world that the United States has ventured into. And Barack Obama can set this country on a different course.'</p> <p>Leonardo DiCaprio straddles two diametrically opposed worlds: the greed and instant gratification of Hollywood and impassioned environmentalism. He drives what he calls a golf-cart car, a Prius, and he made The 11th Hour, a detailed documentary about our planet in crisis. He is alarmed about 'human beings regarding this planet as a service station'. </p> <p>And yet the message comes with a smile. He once picked up a journalist's tape recorder after they'd both ordered lunch and the writer went to make a call. He told the machine that the writer shouldn't be eating hamburgers, even though DiCaprio himself had ordered one, because cows release methane gas; but you can't have tuna either, he said, because the nets capture innocent little dolphins. He was being jokey but serious at the same time. He doesn't mean to preach. Besides, he has been a Hollywood bad boy - one who liked to throw horse shit at Italian paparazzi and hang out in bars with gaggles of models wearing tiny outfits.</p> <p>But the contradictions work to make him human. That's why he relished the idea of playing a more complex character in Body of Lies, one that was neither a hero nor a villain. He laughs: 'Of course it was so much easier to play someone caught in a moral web, who tries to manipulate people as best he can, but who knows he is also being manipulated. He goes on a personal journey where he realises that he is not part of any specific nationality any more. It's not about nationality; it's about what's right or wrong for him.</p> <p>'When you are given an opportunity to make a film like Body of Lies, and I would put Blood Diamond in the same category, of course you jump at these opportunities. Blood Diamond shed a different light on that trade.'</p> <p>I would like to think, as DiCaprio believes, that Body of Lies will shed a different light on the war on terror, but it opened in the US in a week dominated by the recent Wall Street crash and had to settle for third place in the movie charts behind Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Still, DiCaprio argues gamely, 'Historically we are going to look back at this type of movie and it will make people really think about what was going on at the time.' </p> <p>One imagines that DiCaprio will have greater success with Sam Mendes's Revolutionary Road, which reunites him with Kate Winslet. A haunting, gnawing movie based on the novel by Richard Yates, it's set in the mid-Fifties, post-Second World War but pre-Mad Men. Winslet and DiCaprio's relationship is sour and spiralling. They play a young married couple, Frank and April Wheeler, who are stuck in suburbia, trapped by the social confines of their lives and of their time. Frank has lost his nerve and lost his way. April is a trapped housewife, a homemaker who wants to go to Paris and be bohemian, but finds herself pregnant with a third baby. </p> <p>The story resonates with DiCaprio because, as he asks, 'What is the American dream supposed to be? And how similar are we now to that era, in a lot of ways? It's about two people going crazy in that kind of environment. Being stripped of their identity and feeling they are living a life of clich\u00e9s. What drew me towards it was that it's very reflective of the United States's moral position in the Fifties and this is where we still hinge ourselves morally, how we view our family, our fundamentals. And also, I'm a huge fan of Kate and Sam.'</p> <p>But he seems uneasy that working with Kate again conjures up Titanic. DiCaprio was already one of the most famous and perhaps one of the most beautiful men in the world before Titanic. He could have had anything he wanted. But after Titanic he couldn't go out without a million girls chasing him, screaming, and he hated it. He turned down everything big-box-office after Titanic: said no to Anakin Skywalker, American Psycho and Spiderman, which turned his best friend Tobey Maguire into a star. He feared it: 'It was never my intention to have my image shown around the world.' Or to see barbers in Afghanistan arrested as they enraged the Taliban by offering a Leo DiCaprio-style haircut labelled 'The Titanic'. Then there was the time at an airport in Paris when a teenager grabbed his leg and pressed her head into it, clutching desperately. He tried to tell her that if she would get off his leg he would talk to her, but she wouldn't leave. The incident marked him. He wanted to be an actor, not a celebrity. He didn't do any movies at all for a couple of years because he was said to be suffering from 'post-Titanic distress syndrome' - the kind of fame where everyone wants to talk to you but nobody wants to listen to what you've got to say. </p> <p>'The movies that I'm doing now are the movies that I've always wanted to do,' he says. 'If I'd had these opportunities when I was younger I'd have done them in a heartbeat. But you don't always get the chance to make films that you have a kinship to when you're starting. I took some time off after Titanic because I needed to let the dust settle, and recharge my battery. I felt, \"OK, you've been given a tremendous opportunity, what are you going to do with it? Now your name can finance movies that you do want to do.\" That wasn't something that I wanted to squander. I wanted to wait until </p> <p>I felt I could really contribute something that had the kind of edge I'd always been looking for since I started.' </p> <p>Although these films might have had edge without box office, the combined effect was to make Leo an almost impossible combination, an edgy Hollywood star. His character in Revolutionary Road might be his best bet yet for an Oscar. He seems to light up when he talks about his darkness. 'It's a film about the disintegration of a relationship. We're putting a smile on our face and doing all the things you should be doing in a loving relationship, but the darker side is taking over. It's people who are holding on to their love in circumstances that are ripping them apart. I'm more attracted to doing that sort of thing these days because things in this world... they aren't easy, they're very complicated.'</p> <p>You wonder if his relationship with Bar Refaeli, the Israeli supermodel, is uncomplicated. He is a Scorpio with Libra rising. 'That means I'm trying to balance the passionate, dark, insane parts of Scorpio the best I can, and I think I'm doing a pretty good job.'</p> <p>DiCaprio started off strangely shy around women. He says, 'I've always been a slow starter. My first date was with a girl called Cessi. We had a beautiful relationship over the phone all summer and then when we met I couldn't look her in the eye.' He doesn't seem to look many people in the eye directly for long, but that hasn't stopped him romancing Kate Moss, Helena Christensen, Eva Herzigova and Amber Valletta. </p> <p>He says that he would love to have a wife he feels comfortable with. He says he wants a kid 'some day'. We have to skirt borders very carefully when talking about intimate things, not least because he doesn't want to be defined by his relationships with supermodels. For a long time he would take his mum to premieres instead of an inamorata. He has never liked to talk about his girlfriends, be pictured with them, or give tantalising details away, because that would feed the paparazzi, who have made him miserable. Instead, he's one of those actors who feels that 'defining yourself to the public on a consistent basis is death to a performer. The more you define who you are personally the less you are able to submerge into the characters you do, and people will think, \"I don't buy him in that role.\"'</p> <p>So the image we have of him is amorphous, a bad-boy superhero, soulful but likes to party, committed to his work but not necessarily to his long-term girlfriends. He once said his ideal wife would be one who was independent, who wouldn't mind if he went off to Alaska at a moment's notice with his friends. Robert De Niro is his friend. Not the kind of hanging-out-with friend, but the kind of friend who would recommended him to Martin Scorsese. 'I was humbled by that. De Niro-Scorsese is my generation's choice of greatest actor-director dynamic. It is to the previous one's Brando-Kazan.' He is about to start a fourth film with Scorsese, Shutter Island. They are muse and mentor. 'I have so much respect for him. Who doesn't, you know?' </p> <p>Scorsese had to wait years for his Oscar. Does DiCaprio mind missing out three times? 'I have a theory. We all have our personal choices of who we think should win, but there are certain times you look back at the movie that won that year and you think, \"How was that humanly possible?\"'</p> <p>Sometimes people get the Oscar for the wrong movie, I suggest. 'Yes, but I am not feverishly hunting one down. I am trying to do the best work I possibly can and making movies that will have resonance for years to come. I think if you try for an Oscar or a goal like that, the more people are going to see it as transparent. It's not on my radar. If it happens, great, but I'm happy to continue working as I am, really.'</p> <p>He is happy being an active person. 'Life's too short to be lazy and passive, and I don't like to stay in one environment for too long, or get set in one way of thinking. I love to travel, get involved in different environmental projects. Stimulate myself.'</p> <p>It's been written that you like to be on your own a lot. 'No. I think I'm more of a people person.' Is it true that you have the same set of about 10 really good friends that you grew up with because you don't need new friends and never lose old ones? 'Mmm,' he considers. 'I suppose, yes. I do have about 10 really good friends. But the fact I don't have new ones is not true.'</p> <p>It is true that you don't necessarily know who to trust, he says, returning to the theme. 'People who are celebrities are shrouded in mystery. Jack Nicholson said, \"By the very nature of being known you meet more people in an average week.\" It makes you hold on to the people you know and trust. But at the same time I try to keep an open mind, because there are a lot of fascinating people out there. Being an environmentalist and also doing this business opens me up to entirely different worlds, and I love to juggle those things.'</p> <p>So it seems there are two contradicting Leos: shy, untrusting, circumspect Leo, and gregarious, up-for-anything Leo. He's been careful to display both, so I'll never pin him down as one or the other. He's answered everything, but not very exactly. He's played a perfect game. He keeps you smiling and he's laughing, even. He doesn't let you get too close, but he doesn't let you notice the distance.</p> <p>\u2022 Body of Lies opens on 21 November</p>",
  "<p>For sale: four-bedroom detached bungalow, some work needed, cost: $800. The catch? It's in Detroit, home to the once mighty Ford, General Motors and Chrysler, and not many people want to live in the Motor City now that the American car giants are laying off tens of thousands of workers. </p> <p>The bungalow is not the only bargain basement property up for grabs: thousands of others are on the market for $10,000 or less. One estate agent who has sold 50 properties - mostly foreclosures - in Detroit is trying to remain upbeat but admits: 'It is a blue-collar town like a lot of other American towns, but it has been hit harder than most.' He says there are houses are going for $5,000 while homeowners next door are struggling to pay a $60,000 to $70,000 mortgage on an identical property. 'It's obviously devastating for them.'</p> <p>The Detroit property market and the US car industry are mirror images: both are in freefall. Speculation is mounting that the government is planning a bail-out of the giant 'Detroit Three'. On Thursday, Presidential candidate Barack Obama added to the clamour, calling for a doubling of the $25bn in government loans recently approved by Congress to help the industry make more fuel-efficient cars.</p> <p>Washington is also said to be trying to engineer a merger of GM and Chrysler as analysts predict that the latter's new owner, private equity firm Cerberus, could pull the plug on it. Without dramatic government intervention, analysts predict all three companies will run out of money some time next year. </p> <p>This side of the Atlantic, the mood of car manufacturers is less grim. But not by much, as they fear they could be next in line: car makers are slashing production across the board to cut costs as sales slump. In the UK, Japanese firm Honda last week said it would cut output by a tenth - 32,000 vehicles, rather than 22,000 as previously planned. All the other five major carmakers in the UK - Toyota, Nissan, Jaguar/Land Rover, Ford and GM - have made similar moves, putting workers on four-day weeks and getting rid of overtime and agency shift workers. No one knows how many 'temporary' production cuts will be made permanent, or when - as will surely happen - jobs are shed along with output. </p> <p>The clamour in Europe for some kind of bail-out is also growing as car makers ask why the banks should get all the help. On Wednesday, the European Commission said that up to \u20ac40bn (\u00a331bn) of 'soft loans' could be provided to the industry by the European Investment Bank. Ostensibly, like the US plan to provide $25bn, this would help companies retool their factories to meet tough EU legislation being proposed to cut carbon emissions from new cars. But if the industry wasn't in crisis, it is unlikely this money would be on the table and, if approved, it would be a bail-out in all but name.</p> <p>It's hard to exaggerate the scale of the crisis facing the Detroit Three; in many ways, they are in a more parlous state than the banks. In 2000, the high-water mark for the industry, the combined stock market value of Ford and GM was more than $130bn. Today, you could pick up both for $10bn and still have change. Citigroup analysts estimate that the pair are carrying $69bn of debt between them. Since 2005, the companies have been haemorrhaging money: in the first half of this year they lost almost $30bn. Paul Newton, analyst from consultancy Global Insight, says: 'The big three are in severe trouble. The past couple of years have been a bloodbath.'</p> <p>And how did they get themselves into this mess? More than any other incumbent car makers, they've been outwitted by nimbler, more efficient - and cheaper - foreign rivals. Twenty years ago, more than two-thirds of cars made in the US were manufactured by GM, Ford and Chrysler. This year, according to the Centre for Automotive Research, for the first time foreign car makers, led by Toyota, will overtake them. </p> <p>The trio have also been hamstrung by the ruinous cost - estimated at $100bn - of providing healthcare for two million current and former workers. Last year, a landmark agreement with the UAW union capped these liabilities, but the damage had already been done. </p> <p>That was not all. Soaring fuel prices have soured Americans' love affair with big, powerful 'sports utility vehicles' and boosted sales of smaller cars - more typically made by the big three's rivals. When the credit crunch took hold a year ago and property sales plummeted because of the shortage of credit, car loans also began to dry up. In response, the three companies have announced plans to close 35 plants, mostly in the area around Detroit, with the total loss of 100,000 jobs. GM and Ford are looking to expand operations in lower-cost places, such as Mexico, China and Africa. </p> <p>But this restructuring, huge as it is, already looks hopelessly inadequate to stem their ballooning losses. With recession looming, credit, for the few people contemplating buying a new car in these straitened times, is even harder to come by. The financing arm of GM recently announced lending restrictions which, dealers estimate, would prevent almost two-thirds of would-be GM buyers from finding a loan, and Chrysler has made similar moves. Toyota plans to take advantage, according to Citigroup analysts, by offering interest-free loans on 11 models, which will only hasten the decline of the Detroit Three. </p> <p>Citigroup predicts a 35 per cent sales slump overall in October compared with last year, with GM and Chrysler even worse hit as they withdraw credit. US car sales will pick up - most analysts predict a recovery in 2010 - but to what extent the big three will benefit is unclear. PWC estimated in September that they planned to cut production by about one million vehicles by 2012, but this may not be enough. </p> <p>Newton says: 'The question is whether the big three can cut jobs and close factories, particularly in the US, quickly enough to offset their losses. Their current restructuring plan is based on last year's industry forecasts. However, the outlook is far worse now. It's touch and go.' </p> <p>He also doubts whether the rumoured merger of GM and Chrysler would do more than delay the inevitability of further plant closures and job losses by a couple of months. </p> <p>Summing up the apprehensive mood among car makers in Europe, Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Renault-Nissan, said recently: 'We don't know if we're at the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning.' </p> <p>European car makers no longer look on at the plight of the big three with the sense of detachment they had a year ago: the question now being asked in boardrooms across the continent is: 'Could it happen to us?'</p> <p>The situation is certainly tough in the UK, but the news isn't all bad. We never had a 'big three' anyway and the last 'national champion' - Rover - collapsed some time ago. Last week, Ford announced plans to invest \u00a370m in its Bridgend engine assembly plant and BMW is building a new electric Mini at Oxford. Even if EU legislation on carbon emissions is watered down or delayed, as the industry wants, the trend towards more fuel-efficient cars will benefit the UK's Japanese car makers, who tend to make smaller, more efficient vehicles.</p> <p>But the last remaining Ford and GM plants in the UK are more vulnerable. There is a big question mark hanging over the future of Ford's Southampton Transit van plant and GM's plants at Luton and Liverpool. Both companies have a lot of capacity all over Europe and may want to retrench to their German bases. How the UK's Jaguar/Land-Rover, bought by Indian conglomerate Tata last year from Ford, can also halve its gas guzzlers' emissions is not clear. </p> <p>In mainland Europe, particularly France, Germany and Italy, car makers can count on government intervention to help them ride out the storm. British car makers aren't so lucky. PWC estimates UK annual production will fall by around 12 per cent to 1.5 million vehicles by 2012. This is a larger fall than predicted for the UK's European counterparts - France (8.6 per cent) and Germany (where a 3.7 per increase is forecast).</p> <p>The crisis gripping the big three and the alarm growing among Europe's car makers will, in effect, only hasten the inevitable: the shift of production to countries where costs are lower, primarily India, China, Russia and Thailand. </p> <p>Who will emerge from the biggest shake-out in the industry's 100-year history to lead the march into the new markets is not clear. But don't bet your house - even if it's in Detroit - on any one of the big three taking the honour.</p>",
  "<h2>Tobias Wolff</h2> <p><strong>Celebrated novelist and memoirist. His latest short story collection, Our Story Begins, was published in August. Won the 1985 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction for The Barracks Thief (1984)</strong></p> <p>Last week I was roused from sleep by a strange dream - that my bearded, hairy-backed, happily married older brother Geoffrey, now 70 and up to his eyeballs in grandchildren, had decided to get a sex change. My mentioning this to anyone who knows him has unfailingly produced peals of laughter. All right - dreams are funny, when they're funny. But imagine waking every day to the dream that George W Bush is your president.</p> <p>I simply can't, as Justice Scalia has advised, 'get over it'. As I grind my coffee to the morning newscast and the image of our confident president appears, the bile rises in the gorge, boiling over into tantrums and rants and declarations of despair that, even in the moment, strike me as clownish and pitiable, and are certainly viewed by my family in that light, until they join in.</p> <p>No, I can't get over it, and neither can my friends, hard as we all try. When we meet for dinner we do our best to take up other subjects - books, gossip, movies, our children - but then, like the addicts we've become, we sneak back to the drug of outrage, shooting up the latest barefaced lie and squalid revelation, not forgetting to list yet again the national and global catastrophes brought about by the incompetence, hypocrisy, muddleheadedness, venality, truculence, mendacity, callousness, zealotry, machismo, lawlessness, cynicism, wishful thinking, and occasional downright evil of the administration of George W Bush. Our economy is in freefall, our public school system a disgrace, our military exhausted, the wounded and traumatised dying of neglect, yea, the very earth groaning for relief - and he's optimistic! Yessiree! Looking forward to it! Leaning toward us over the podium with that exasperated little squint and that impatient, dentist-drill voice, utterly at a loss as to how he got saddled with a nation of such gloomy Guses and crybabies.</p> <p>Eddying around our own indignation again and again, as if caught in some Bermuda Triangle of complaint, we are unable not to remind each other of the fatal character of George Bush's incomprehension, the thousands upon thousands who have died by his blithe actions and inactions, and his inability to understand at any level - political, moral, emotional - the terrible damage he has done, this man whose idea of sharing in the grief of parents who've lost a son or daughter in Iraq is to give up playing golf! If he really did.</p> <p>There - I've stepped in the trap again. I can't help it. And for many of us that has been a defining condition of life in George W Bush's reign, this unanswerable need to register anew and aloud our shock and dismay, indeed our disbelief, at finding him at the wheel as we wake each morning. </p> <p>Was it ever so? Nixon, especially in his last months, inspired fits of revulsion, but never incredulity that he had achieved the office in the first place. Same with Johnson. They were at least very smart, and deeply experienced. </p> <p>So how did George W Bush do it? On the face of it, such a man getting himself elected President of the United States would seem an impossibility - this party boy, this tangle-tongued, failed businessman who always managed to save his own bacon while his investors went under, this tough-talking supporter of the Vietnam war who hid out in the Texas Air National Guard when his turn came to serve. Karl Rove's strategic exploitation of social divisions and resentments deserves some of the credit. The Supreme Court, to be sure - Bush vs Gore. Chicanery at the polls and a lot of dumb luck, most notably in the form of 3,000 old folks flummoxed by a confusing ballot. All this and more. But there had to be something else, a meta-narrative if you will, that established him in the hearts of the large minority who voted for him in 2000 and the decisive majority who returned him to power in 2004. And what else could that have been, but what it always is with such empty shirts? Nostalgia. </p> <p>In short, he presented himself as a man of the past - that star-spangled past when it only took one ranger to quell a riot, and you drove big cars without getting sneered at by sissies on bicycles, and you could make a few million without having to divvy it up with the lazy pathetnoids next door; when neighbours talked over the fence and could depend on each other, and the rivers ran straight and clear and teeming with trout, and you could dredge them for gold without the government breathing down your neck, and the trees were really big and you could chop them down, and you won wars, and men wore hats to work and meant what they said, and nobody was gay, and the queers all lived in New York, and you could say under God and have a Christmas tree on the town green without people in turbans and sidelocks getting up your nose about it.</p> <p>That was the America we think we grew up in, and we want it back, and George W Bush, with his down-home voice, and gunslinger swagger, and no-nonsense contempt for the complications of a modern society, gave clear promise of a right of return to that good and simple past. That was his appeal, in both senses of the word. And in this one thing, alas, he was sincere.</p> <p>He wants the fictional past to become the actual present. </p> <p>This might be risible if he weren't President. But he is, and it isn't, because he has resolutely declined to prepare for any future he doesn't approve of, say the one where his war perversely ignores the script, and 4,000 young Americans get killed, and 40,000 more come home with wounds to their bodies, and still more thousands return with wounds to their minds and souls that may never heal, and find themselves, for lack of any foresight at all, in understaffed, rat-infested hospitals and psych wards, while the people we claimed to be saving are killed and crippled in even greater numbers - numbers unknown, because it has been our stated policy not to count them. George W Bush wouldn't countenance that future. Or the future where we start running out of oil. Or the future where glaciers disappear and McMurdo Bay starts looking like a good bet for a Club Med. Or the future where our economy begins to melt into foreign hands. Or the future where foreign hands begin to refuse our economy. </p> <p>We have been in dire need of someone who could adapt to, even, within reason, anticipate manifestly changing conditions in this country and the world at large. But we have had George W Bush, who views change as illicit, even as betrayal, and will not compound the betrayal by any change in himself. And under his unmoving hand you can feel the country straining to move forward, like some great engine shrieking toward the breaking point as the driver presses the pedal to the floor but refuses to shift from neutral into gear.</p> <p>Of course he could not have staged this astonishing performance without support. I'm not speaking of Rove, Cheney, Rice, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld, Feith, Perle, Gonzales, Ashcroft, Bremer, Tenet, 'Scooter' (!) Libby, David Addington and John Yoo and the rest of that scabrous crowd of armchair warriors, perjurers, torturers, and fools. No, they didn't put him in office; the American people did. 'My fellow Americans' - to use the term by which every lying speech is prefaced. And the fact of his election, as much as the incessant abrasion of George W Bush's misgovernment, oppresses me with embarrassment and, I confess, a certain despair for our future.</p> <p>Yes, embarrassment - because his electors really are, after all, my fellow Americans, and I have always wanted to believe in their basic good sense, as I want them to believe in mine. That trust is in fact the very ground of a democratic society. Yet enough of my fellow Americans played the sucker to give this man two terms as President. Amazing! In truth, you never saw such a transparently smug, happily ignorant, unread, unthinking candidate for high office, let alone this office. Surely his unsuitability was plain to everyone. It should have been - he had a nearly unbroken record of personal unreliability and professional incompetence going into the first election, and by the second his record was perfect. There was simply no good argument to be made for his election, and every good argument to be made against his re-election. What did he have to offer, after all, beyond nostalgia? The bribe of lower taxes, already proven to be a sham for all but the richest few, and the continued sacrifice of our young people and our dwindling resources in a deceptively-undertaken and stupidly-executed war. By no reasonable standard could my fellow Americans, most of them anyway, see him as representing their interests. But they voted for him anyway. Why? Because Jesus is his 'favourite philosopher'. Because they felt more comfortable with him than with either of the serious, substantial men who opposed him. Because they'd rather have a beer with him!</p> <p>As the old saying has it, the turkeys voted for Thanksgiving. </p> <p>And though it is snobbish of me to say so, elitist and undemocratic, I will say that the embarrassment I've been feeling for the last seven years proceeds exactly from that sense of my fellow Americans cheerfully volunteering to be plucked, gutted, bled and hung upside down. It has made me embarrassed, as of some public foolishness by one's family, and it has made me vindictive. When I see someone being rude to a waiter, or blocking the road in a Ford Expedition, or yakking loudly on a cell phone in a crowded elevator, I naturally assume they voted for George W Bush. And - this is really mean, I know, really unfair and unreasonable and inhumane, and I scold myself for this, believe me, but - when a tornado tears off a few roofs in Texas, I think, serves you right! And I have friends in Texas. That's some of what the last seven years have done to this writer.</p> <p>Well, boo hoo, what did I expect? Didn't Jesus, and Chuang Tzu, and Shakespeare, and Mark Twain, and my other favourite philosophers all warn me about politics and politicians? Aren't I a little old for all this gnashing of teeth? I am, I am, and I fear I have years more of it ahead of me, because even now the mud is flying, and the fear machine is humming, and we're on our way back to the past.</p> <h2>Edmund White</h2> <p><strong>Novelist, short story-writer and critic, best-known for his autobiographical novels, which include A Boy's Own Story (1982). Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. </strong></p> <p>I moved back to the States from France 10 years ago and soon after my repatriation (after 16 years in Paris) Bush was elected. Although I am perhaps the least political person I know (the first time I voted in my long life was against Bush in the last presidential election), nevertheless a bad president has a depressing effect on the entire culture, no matter how strenuously one ignores him. As a gay man who has always felt that society at large despises me and that I'd be considered a criminal by most of my fellow citizens, I've never wanted to participate in electoral politics - or politics of any sort. I remember that during the Watergate trials I dismissed the whole brouhaha as 'their scandal'.</p> <p>But I had known two moments of political euphoria - Mitterrand's election and Blair's. I was in Paris for the first with French friends who were delirious, and for gays there were immediate benefits. Mitterrand acknowledged that the gay vote had helped him and he dissolved that part of the police force that was supposed to run after gays having sex in the parks at night. I was at a book party that Martin Amis and his wife were giving for me the night Blair was elected, and again I felt the exultation and got caught up in it. Unfortunately, both men turned out to be corrupt or seriously misguided.</p> <p>With Bush it was a different matter. Here was this grinning, supercilious frat boy who'd adopted a fake Texas accent (his family is from Maine), who'd managed to be 'born again' in order to attract the votes of the Christian Right, who'd been responsible for more public executions of criminals than any official in recent memory, who denied global warming, who'd evaded military service but was soon enough sending thousands of American soldiers to their deaths. Here was an oaf who wanted to give the president of Germany back rubs - which she angrily rejected - and who surrounded himself with the most blatant emblems of corporate greed in American history. During Bush's watch in the last eight years there have been four major disasters - 9/11, Iraq, Katrina and the Wall Street crash - and Bush has responded slothfully to each one. He started the war, he bungled the post-hurricane relief effort, and the deregulation that the Republicans fought so long and hard for has produced the crash.</p> <p>Perhaps the most depressing moment in the last eight years was Bush's re-election. As a teacher, I've long lamented the dumbing down of America; now I was tempted to see our educational failure as a plot to keep the electorate stupid and gullible. In America, a tiny elite receives a rigorous education and the rest of the population is kept in darkest ignorance, just as a small percentage of our youngsters constitute Olympic champion athletes and the rest of the population is grotesquely obese: a strange idea of democracy. I was prepared to believe that Dubya's first election had been a mistake or a cheat, but the idea that the voters could re-elect him was too grim to contemplate. </p> <p>As a writer, I found the whole climate under Bush particularly disheartening. Funding for the arts and humanities was at an all-time low. Whereas small bookshops have been saved in France by the Jack Lang law, which forbids discounting of books, in America independent bookstores (including the 50 or so gay ones) were wiped out by the big chains, which are now beginning to go under as well, driven out by Amazon. With our passion for deregulation and the freedom of the market, we would never defend the rights of consumers to have community bookstores (which in America are often community cultural centres) alive and well on every corner. </p> <p>After 9/11 the press was at its weakest and least vocal. I'd always been used to the liberal papers in America examining every governmental excess or infringement with a magnifying glass; now no one seemed to be looking. Most people were getting their news online and most newspapers were cutting back or closing down - and more and more of them belonged to Rupert Murdoch. Similarly, all the small independent publishers were being bought up by conglomerates, many of them in no way previously connected to the book industry. More and more titles were being published but in smaller and smaller runs; it seemed that there were no longer any common talking points among Americans.</p> <p>They lived isolated in their suburban houses, looking at hundreds of cable channels, driving through streets empty of pedestrians; America had become the saddest place on earth. The very rich had become even richer and everyone else was considerably poorer. Conveniently for the Republicans, the last great taboo in America is class. No one is allowed to mention it, not even novelists. Whereas British novelists are always beavering away defining ever more minute class differences, American writers can get a sense of contrast only by looking at the Third World. As a judge two years ago for the Granta top 20 American writers under 35 contest, the trend I most noticed is what I'd call the Peace Corps novel. Everyone is writing about India and South America and the Philippines and Vietnam - no one is writing about the big city or rural poor in America.</p> <p>I have a good friend who is a descendent of President Pierce, who was against abolition in the years leading up to the Civil War. Until now he's always been considered the worst president (there are two or three other candidates). My friend is grateful to Bush for knocking out all the competition.</p> <h2>Yiyun Li</h2> <p><strong>Won the Guardian First Book Award for her short story collection A Thousand Years of Good Prayers. Her first novel, The Vagrants, will be published in the UK in February</strong></p> <p>America in the late 1990s seemed a happy place. Or perhaps it was just my exuberant naivety; having recently arrived in the country in my early twenties as a science student, I lived contentedly on a graduate stipend of $15,000 a year, watching network news and sitcoms every night to understand America. One evening I burned my hand while cooking and the next day the nurse at the students' clinic took a look at it and said, 'Honey, what on earth did you do to yourself?' </p> <p>I replied, rather shamefully, that I had been watching the coverage of the Clinton impeachment and wasn't paying attention to the bursting oil. The nurse guffawed and told me that she wanted to be the one to inform the doctor of this accident, as she could not wait to see his face when he heard the story. </p> <p>How bad could a country become when there was so much laughter around? The economy was strong, wars and genocides happened on other continents, and a mother not far from where I lived gave birth to seven babies. The biggest fear, as the turn of the century drew near, was the millennium bug - remember Y2K? - but the millennium arrived with fireworks, and without any disaster. George W Bush became President, but at the time even this looked like a laughable joke to the circle of foreign students living in our apartment building. So we laughed, not understanding how Americans could have made such a decision. </p> <p>Happiness is like childhood, always ending before one is prepared. Two years later I found a part-time job in a lab in a hospital basement, where fluorescent lamps buzzed in the windowless room. I had by then given up my science career for a dream of becoming a writer, and my lab work was simply to pay the bills. My job - rather appropriate for an aspiring writer - was to assist in research on the formation of voice. Twice a week I would go to a cardiology lab, where an exchange scholar from Bangladesh running cardiology tests on dogs would, at the end of the experiments, turn off all the switches that stopped the circulation. The dogs, still warm to the touch, waited to be dissected. </p> <p>My companion at the ordeal was Sanyukta, a PhD student from India whose dream was to become a professor in America. Neither of us wanted to perform the dissection alone, even after we had honed our skills. Having a fellow sufferer did not lessen our individual pain, but we clung on to each other's presence in those days, and walked back together to the basement with plastic bags containing the dog's vocal tissues which we had managed to cut out, and which we later tried to culture in Petri dishes. </p> <p>On other days, when we received a phone call from the autopsy unit alerting us that a human patient had agreed to donate vocal tissues, we would walk across the hospital with a bucket of dry ice, and wait for the precious tissue. It was on those days, when we felt happy that we did not have to open up a dog, that Sanyukta and I began to talk about our lives, and our conversation, inevitably, would turn to America and its present state. Our biggest fear then was that four years of a Bush administration would be a turning point for America. We understood each other's concern well; after leaving our native countries both of us had made the decision to make America home. </p> <p>'Never in history has there been a superpower that could remain a superpower,' Sanyukta liked to say. </p> <p>'For every empire that rises there will be a journey going downhill,' I would agree. 'Take China, for example.'</p> <p>'Take India,' Sanyukta agreed. 'Take Britain.'</p> <p>Toward the end of the next summer I decided to quit the job, which, like America and many of the disastrous decisions the administration had already made, had become depressing. On my last day Sanyukta bemoaned the loss of a companion to the cardiology lab. 'Ask someone else from the lab to accompany you,' I said, but she replied that the Americans in the lab, as dog lovers, would be too sensitive to take over the responsibility. 'The humility of life. That's what I think they don't know. The country has not been invaded and the people have not been ruled by another people,' Sanyukta said. 'Americans don't understand humility.'</p> <p>Bush has remained president for eight years, rather than four years as Sanyukta and I had hoped, and these years seem to have confirmed our fear in that basement lab that America is going downhill. Bad news is prevalent, both from within the country and outside: the national debt, the questionable tax cuts, and now the financial crisis; wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, with human costs as high as the monetary costs; disasters of foreign policy and public diplomacy. America, at some level, reminds me of China in the late 1800s, when the country proudly considered itself the Middle Kingdom at the centre of the world. </p> <p>America no longer seems to me to be the euphorically happy place it was when I arrived. This is to be expected, as, after all, I am no longer a young Alice, eyes widened by the discovery of a marvellous wonderland. Still, America, which I consider now as my home, has taken on a soberness that would not have seemed the right mood for the country eight years ago, and perhaps this soberness will accompany America in its ongoing journey, whether it is one that goes uphill or downhill. </p> <h2>Walter Mosley</h2> <p><strong>Renowned for his crime fiction, notably the mystery series featuring detective Easy Rawlins which began with Devil in a Blue Dress (1990).</strong> </p> <p>The reign of George Bush II marks, with its passing, the end of absolute white male hegemony in American politics. Bush, along with his cronies - Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice and Rove - received the strongest hand that could be dealt a sitting president and squandered the potential for true personal, party, national and international advancement. After the World Trade Centre disaster we (Americans) had the sympathy and support of much of the globe on our side. But instead of capitalising on this largesse we declared war on the world and upon our own people - especially the poor.</p> <p>Masquerading as conservative, God-fearing Republicans, Bush and his lackeys sought to shore up the cracks in white male domination through the primary religion of America - capitalism. They empowered the wealthy by eliminating restrictions on how the rich did business, by cutting the taxes of the most affluent, and by sending the poorest among us, those young people who found themselves floundering in the new economy, off to war with vague promises of glory and possible financial support later on.</p> <p>Our soldiers have been killed and maimed, scarred physically and psychologically. Most have seen no remuneration and their homeland is no safer or any more secure. </p> <p>Bush has done many things wrong. Sometimes these transgressions have hurt us but even when we are wounded we learn. We now have a glimmer of understanding why so much of the world hates us and why so many others have disdain for our archaic sense of pride and vacuous moral authority.</p> <p>Knowing something is wrong is the first step toward rehabilitation. The war we cannot win, the job we cannot save, the mortgage we cannot afford ... Much of this can be laid at the doorstep of our lame duck, bailout President. But, to be fair, he has shown many Americans the fallacy of their convictions. We can see now, better than ever before, that business as usual will not see us through.</p> <p>This said, it's hard for me to gauge the positive against the negative of the second George Bush administration. We needed to understand that the old America is gone. We have women and poor people and people of colour that must be added into the equation. We have neighbours that must be heard and questions that must be asked. Without the travesty of the past eight years I don't know how we would have gotten there. I mean, I suppose that Bush could have toned down his response to those he didn't understand; he could have sought a more peaceful coexistence with those that are different. But he didn't have the acuity to achieve a higher goal. And his excuses for his actions have some validity: his constituency placed in power the man they wanted to lead them.</p> <p>But even with all that Bush has done to throw off the balance of our world, some things have changed for the better despite him.</p> <p>The most important change occurred because of our President's conviction that he didn't mind who worked for him as long as they were faithful to his misguided worldview. Therefore he could have two African-American Secretaries of State, one after the other. This action helped to open the door for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And once the door is opened it can never be fully closed again.</p> <p>The black apologists for Bush's lies and Cheney's avarice cleared the way for Obama. Americans, millions of them, are, for the first time, considering somebody other than the white male candidate. This was bound to happen sooner or later but Bush's racial blindness and political irresponsibility, I believe, pushed the envelope a bit faster. </p> <p>Never again will we be the nation concerned only with the liberation and security of the white man's property. It doesn't matter who wins our election. America has changed for good. The people will continue to demand fairness and equality. They will demand that our actions in the world be considered and considerate of different points of view. Black and brown and Asian men and women will throw their hats into the ring, not as brainwashed servants but as people who see us all as a part of that pulsing, bulging mass of humanity that struggles to survive in this ever-growing, ever-shrinking world.</p> <h2>Rick Moody</h2> <p><strong>Bestselling novel The Ice Storm (1994) was made into a film directed by Ang Lee. His memoir, The Black Veil (2002) was also widely acclaimed.</strong></p> <p>'The business of America is business,' Calvin Coolidge, 30th President of the United States, was reputed to have said in January of 1925, just four years shy of Black Friday and the onset of the Great Depression. </p> <p>It's not hard to think of George W Bush mangling some similar perception, though at the time of his own ascension to the presidency in January 2001, Bush hadn't yet been very successful at business. Not if his stewardship of Arbusto Energy or Harken Energy is any indication. It wasn't until Bush became general partner of a professional baseball team, the Texas Rangers, that he made any real money at all. Nevertheless, Bush drank deep of the lessons of American capitalism, as he pointed out himself in December of 2000: 'I understand small business growth. I was one.'</p> <p>This was W as we first experienced him. The President who timidly, awkwardly succeeded Bill Clinton and who oversaw the bitter end of the so-called New Economy. It would be easy to pin all the blame for diminished corporate earnings and emptied tax coffers and a weak dollar and a huge trade imbalance on Bush, but neither was Clinton's administration free of its share of economic bluster, and neither was Clinton shy about transitioning away from investment in the public sector, as with predecessors like Ronald Reagan and Bush the Elder. This part of the march of history George W Bush inherited, the period after the internet stock bubble, which meant that things were already, early in his presidency, grim, unstable, uncertain. According to the only political model he knew, the business model, Bush's newly minted administration immediately moved to invite Kenneth Lay (of the soon-to-be former Enron Corporation) to closed-door meetings with Dick Cheney, as well as to the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. Other CEOs found similar welcome. The hangover from the internet bubble was hard enough to live with, but Bush, by putting all or most of federal operations up for sale, inaugurated an even more challenging epoch. Call it the 'Years of Shareholder Value', since, as Bush often opined, government needed to behave more like a business.</p> <p>After 11 September, though, the sinister legacy of the Bush years has lain in the free-market approach to the war itself, to the war and its aftermath. How quickly after the initial air campaigns and the collapse of Baghdad were Vice President Cheney's former corporate colleagues, Halliburton, and its subsidiaries, engaged in the securing of Iraqi resources for American corporations and their shareholders. Bush then attempted to bring home the same lessons to domestic affairs.</p> <p>The Ownership Society! That was the name for this second term of Bush's America, and it's logical to assume Bush didn't come up with the coinage himself, because how could he have? He has trouble getting through a simple sentence. Probably some staffer, gifted with ad speak, came up with it, coining what was already de facto policy, the notion that the government needs to remove itself entirely from the business of regulation and owning industries, leaving the oversight of corporate capital - as well as derivatives, packaged mortgages, and so on - to an ill-equipped marketplace. </p> <p>What the Ownership Society came to feel like to the overwhelming majority of Americans was feudalism. The modern return of the robber barons. No backstop in the case of catastrophic illness. No backstop in case of corporate malfeasance. No backstop in the case of a despoiled natural environment. No backstop in the case of cascading corporate bankruptcies. The wealthy and the large corporations, now largely unregulated, were free to do as they wished in most if not all areas, in order to increase the bounteous riches of their executives. If only the barely getting by worked harder and saved more, they too might count on the American Dream coming true in their own lives! If not in this generation then in the next!</p> <p>Home ownership is perhaps the shining example of this heartless model of economic progress. The first Bush term yielded to the second, and the unregulated market for homes and mortgages helped make possible the fiscal environment in which a great number of Americans were using real estate speculation as a way to create wealth that was otherwise lost to them in a flat stock market and in the galloping disappearance of the middle class. The banks, initially thriving on the loans and fees required for all this transacting, turned a blind eye to the kind of money being borrowed and often to the desperate people doing the borrowing. Which brings us to where we are today: mired in a precipitous slump in part inaugurated by the failure of booby-trapped mortgages that ought not to have been tendered, loans that ennobled neither borrower nor lender. In addition to facing energy and food prices that are climbing as steadily as their credit card bills, regular middle-class Americans are finding that they are now less likely to be members of the Ownership Society than of the Insolvent Society. </p> <p>The darker American fears meanwhile remain. The fear, the uncertainty, that end-of-empire anxiety. You can see the fear in the demonisation of undocumented workers in the United States. Fear of anything that will unsettle a rank-and-file white voter, the white voter who fears the United States of the future will no longer have a place for him. All of this fear pushes both sides of the electorate toward divisive political rhetoric, class hatred, racialist thinking, and so on. And it sure doesn't improve our diminished reputation abroad.</p> <p>Turns out, meanwhile, that Calvin Coolidge said a lot of other things in that speech from January 1925 - the one in which he said: 'After all, the chief business of the American people is business.' He also said: 'We make no concealment of the fact that we want wealth, but there are many other things that we want very much more. We want peace and honour, and that charity which is so strong an element of all civilisation. The chief ideal of the American people is idealism. I cannot repeat too often that America is a nation of idealists. That is the only motive to which they ever give any strong and lasting reaction.' The bulk of Coolidge's speech seems to have been effaced in these Years of Shareholder Value. These days, a speech remarking that there are 'many things we want more than wealth' might be construed as being anti-business. And in the United States, the anti-business political candidate is even harder to elect than the atheist. Still, maybe, just maybe, these ideals to which Coolidge alluded to are still throbbing in the American consciousness somewhere. Let's hope the years after the Years of Shareholder Value come quickly.</p> <h2>Siri Hustvedt</h2> <p><strong>Novelist, essayist and poet whose most recent novel, The Sorrows of an American, came out this year. Married to fellow writer Paul Auster.</strong></p> <p>Every political moment has a particular rhetorical climate. Language matters, not only because it articulates the dominant ideas of a period but because it shapes our perceptions of the world. For years, Americans have been listening to a president who has essentially cut the world in two. We are 'the protectors of freedom' fighting the 'evil-doers' who 'hate freedom'. Manipulating words for ideological purposes is hardly new. When it is effective, it creates an emotional response in the listener, a rush in the limbic system that can call on the deepest feelings we have as human beings. George W Bush and his administration chose to appeal to our fears.</p> <p>Playing on the age-old fear of malignant outsiders and foreigners, both those residing on American soil and elsewhere, the administration successfully created an atmosphere of absolutism after 11 September 2001. The exhortation 'If you're not with us, you're with the terrorists' is a form of political speech that makes dialogue impossible. There is no legitimate response because anyone who counters with another thought has already been lumped with an inhuman enemy. In psychiatric parlance, rigid polarities like those the President has made time and again are regarded as pathological: 'splitting'. The patient is unable to tolerate ambiguity and insists on viewing the people in his life through an 'all good' or 'all bad' lens. Bush and his cohorts have been masterful splitters, employing a language that gives no room for exchange and necessarily distorts reality, which, unfortunately, is usually murky. This kind of speech does not recognise an interlocutor, a real human other. It is speech without empathy, and it is startlingly similar to the rhetoric of the Muslim radicals who spew venom on the West and 'the enemies of Islam'.</p> <p>To be sure, there is something all too human about this phenomenon. The need for simple juxtapositions of good and evil, heroes and villains, is ubiquitous. It is the stuff of most Hollywood movies and many popular books. Nuance is discarded for easy clarity. It is possible that George W Bush actually views the world in these black and white terms, that his mind is as blunt and unrefined as his impromptu sentences. His now well-known emphasis on loyalty from those who work for him may be an indication of an 'all for' or 'all against' way of thinking. I don't know. I do know that the ironies are multiple. </p> <h2>Aleksandar Hemon</h2> <p><strong>Bosnian-Herzegovinian writer and journalist based in Chicago. His latest novel, The Lazarus Project, is a finalist for the 2008 National Book Award.</strong> </p> <p>I became an American citizen in November 2000, around the time of the infamous electoral impasse and the Supreme Court decision that gifted George W Bush his first presidency. I had ended up in the USA in 1992 because of the war in Bosnia. For eight years I was an alien resident - a contradiction in terms - before I decided to cross the big threshold and fully enter the home of the brave. Hence my first fledgling-American sentiment was full-fledged embarrassment at the democratic process that allowed the candidate for whom the minority of voters had cast their ballots to become the President of all. </p> <p>What made things worse was that W was/is the American stereotype come true - ignorant, incurious, congenitally uncomfortable with thought. Take this: in January 2000, at an Iowa community college, he succinctly laid out his future foreign policy, complete with its idiocy, in these immortal words: 'When I was coming up, it was a dangerous world, and you knew exactly who they were. It was us vs them, and it was clear who them was. Today we are not sure who the they are, but we know they're there.'</p> <p>But the quaint days of mere embarrassment ended abruptly on 11 September 2001, when the 'they' conveniently arrived in hijacked planes and tragically split American history into pre- and post-9/11 periods. I distinctly remember Bush addressing the discombobulated nation that day and saying: 'Freedom itself was attacked.' This at the time when television still showed footage of desperate New Yorkers leaping into certain, horrifying death off the Towers that would collapse in the next image. It seemed possible at that moment that tens of thousands had perished. </p> <p>It was impossible not to feel, deep in your body, the horror and the solidarity in response to the immense suffering. But all that our good President could come up with was a vacuous stock phrase. 'We're fucked,' I remember thinking. If he was capable of converting the terrible concreteness of human pain into a cheap abstraction, then American - let alone human - lives mean nothing to him.</p> <p>And fucked we were. Before long, the stock abstraction exploded into splendid and insufferable fireworks of banality celebrating the now-eternal struggle between the US and the freedom-hating they. Few Americans today wish to recall the time that led up to the invasion of Iraq and the Mission-Accomplished pageant, the time when Bush's approval rating was happily in the nineties; when Arab-looking citizens, including a number of Sikhs, were subject to vengeful assaults; when vulgar patriotism was enforced by ranting pundits and radio-talk-show hosts calling for nuking the towelheads; when French fries became freedom fries (and French kissing became freedom kissing.) This was the shameful time when editorial boards rushed to endorse the new-fangled Bush doctrine and the upcoming cakewalk in Iraq; when journalists at the White House press conferences dully followed the pre-approved script and war correspondents eagerly signed up to be embedded. This was when a vast majority of Americans, liberal and conservative, believed in the mirage of Saddam's WMD, which were - if I may say so as a novice at things American - blatantly and obviously non-existent. Few Americans care to recall those days because the only appropriate reaction to them is deep and humbling shame, and we are a proud people.</p> <p>George W Bush is the worst president in American history not only because everything he and his flunkeys touched instantly turned into long-lasting shit but because he brought out the worst in my fellow citizens and even some fellow foreigners (say, Tony Blair). He built a coalition of the willing participants in a criminal, immoral debacle that the Iraq adventure has been from start to not-in-sight finish. Any war criminal knows that if moral self-denial attains the shape of national pride, anything is possible, any crime can be explained away as either necessary or an honest mistake. Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, the destruction of Fallujah, torture as government policy, waterboarding as a common word, extraordinary renditions, the suspension of habeas corpus, unfettered eavesdropping, the diminishment of mechanisms of American democracy, the unaccountable government - not only did it all become acceptable to the majority of voters in the 2004 elections, it appeared as pride-inducing strength.</p> <p>I am no historian but it is my guess that the Bush regime would be in the running for the worst elected government in the history of Western civilisation. The score sheet is catastrophic: American foreign policy and international prestige are in tatters; the deficit and the national debt are reaching Zimbabwean proportions; states are impoverished and national infrastructure is falling apart; the practices of democracy have been so devalued that a militant bimbo is a viable vice-presidential candidate, while race-baiting is acceptable campaign practice. What to say of the destruction of New Orleans and the collapse of financial markets, neither of which the Bush court seemed particularly interested in until it was too late? Nothing Bush and his administration handled has remained undamaged, no stone misturned, all children left behind to forage through the debris in the aftermath of the past eight years.</p> <h2>Uzodinma Iweala</h2> <p><strong>Won John Llewellyn Rhys prize for Beasts of No Nation (2005). Chosen as one of Granta's Best Young American Novelists in 2007. He now attends Columbia University medical school.</strong></p> <p>George W Bush was elected President of the United States just after my 18th birthday on 7 November 2000. I remember clearly the atmosphere on Harvard's campus. It was a bit subdued because Harvard and its students tend to favour the left, but at the same time somewhat triumphant because whichever candidate, Bush or Gore, won, there would be a Harvard man in the White House. I also remember that I didn't vote. I couldn't vote because I was new to the political process and I didn't register to vote in time. And that ignorance is something that haunts me to this day.</p> <p>This was before 11 September 2001, when President Bush was caricatured as an idiot, but a thoroughly benign one who, if he didn't choke on another Pretzel, would at most spend four years under the direction of his tutor Vice President Cheney before America came to its senses and booted him out in favour of someone more worthy of the office, when his ideas of compassionate conservatism were wholly embraced by some and met with cautious acceptance by others, when as a nation we were still optimistic about our future and sure of our role as a shining example for the world. That has all changed.</p> <p>It sometimes seems that the last eight years have been a highly comical nightmare for the US and President Bush has been the comedic villain. This is the man who instructed us to shop our way out of a national tragedy, who plotted an illegal war based on the most nonsensical of lies that some of us chose to believe. This is the man who transformed torture into enhanced interrogation. This is the man who sat back unconcerned while one of his appointees mismanaged one of the biggest crises in American history - Hurricane Katrina - saying 'he's doing a heck of a job'. And now towards the end of his term, as he chest bumps graduating college seniors and tap dances before the start of press conferences, the war into which he has dragged young Americans rages and our economy slowly disintegrates. That has been the last eight years. For someone who doesn't get nearly enough sleep, I have never wanted to wake up so badly. </p> <p>But perhaps most troubling is what his presidency has done to America's opinion of itself. Where once we were a society that honoured excellence and achievement, the last eight years of President Bush have taught us to aspire to the lowest common denominator. As a country, we now feel that we shouldn't have to pay taxes and yet we still feel entitled to government services. As a country, we feel that we should take the easy road and drill for more oil instead of tightening our belts, parking our SUVs and investing money in alternative energy. As a country, we have allowed our news media to turn politics into a farce with personalities who rant and rave and journalists who trade integrity for access, reporting spoon-fed propaganda as actual news. As a country, we now collectively prefer presidents whom we could 'have a beer with' instead of leaders who will challenge us to rise above our petty insecurities and wants to risk something for our country. </p> <p>But it makes perfect sense. Why should we aspire to more when the decider in chief of the last eight years is a man who waltzed into the presidency on the legacy of his father (just as he waltzed into college, business and the governorship of Texas) and has refused to take responsibility for any of his failures? In my opinion, 'giving up golf', as he claimed, is not atonement enough for the American and Iraqi lives he has jeopardised. When our President has time and again refused to take the hard road towards excellence and deem torture illegal, and tell Americans we need to reduce our energy footprints, or truly invest in education for our young people, what are we supposed to do?</p> <p>The lowest moment of the last eight years for me happened at a school in Baltimore. I gave a talk to an auditorium full of high school students on the subject of war. We began speaking about the Iraq war and, of 500 students, 499 seemed to believe that Iraq had attacked us first and that we were totally justified in invading their country. Only one diminutive freshman in that school of mostly large athletic boys stood up and said: 'Guys. What we're doing over there is not right.' It hurt me to think that after eight years of President Bush, this is the future of America - group-think based on falsities and jingoist myths with dissent offered by only a very few.</p> <p>This has been my political coming of age, watching our President preside over a gaggle of squabbling politicians too fearful to do their jobs and drive the country towards excellence, and a population too beholden to the pursuit of personal gain and the politics of fear to demand more of them. </p> <p>It's only in George W Bush's America that 'community organiser' can be used as a slander and the words 'hope' and 'change' can be ridiculed as meaningless and empty. </p> <p>This is not the same country that I lived in as a teenager, when Teach for America was as important as military service and the word American was golden in the ears of our fellow global citizens. Like I said, I want to wake up. Many of us do, and for the first time in Barack Obama we have found a candidate who seems ready to ring the alarm clock, no matter how annoyed we get as a nation. I'm not an Obamaniac, as people derisively call his supporters, but I recognise that, for the first time in my political life, someone has stood up and said: 'America, it's time to make some hard choices.' </p> <p>In two months, this eight-year journey under the guidance of President Bush through the valleys of mediocrity will either come to an end with Barack Obama or continue for another four, perhaps even eight years with John McCain. </p> <p>On 7 November 2000 I could claim I was naive. On 4 November 2008, there can be no excuses.</p> <h2>Andover to Afghanistan: The life of George W Bush</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> </p> <p><strong>6 July 1946</strong> In New Haven, Connecticut, the oldest child of Barbara Bush and George HW Bush, US President from 1989 to 1993.

  "<h2>Jayne Anne Phillips</h2> <p><strong>Novelist and short-story writer from West Virginia. Her works have been translated into twelve different languages. She runs the creative writing program at Rutgers University, Newark. Jonathan Cape will publish her new novel, Lark and Termite, in spring 2009.</strong></p> <p>The first four years of the Bush administration were devastating, while the last four years have been tragic. We may define 'devastating' as 'overwhelming, distressing, demoralising', causing 'widespread damage, enormous shock and upset', while 'tragic' moves into different territory. 'Tragic' implies permanence, the lasting effects of heroic struggle and downfall, a story already told, in which an individual or society must live with the 'heartbreaking' or 'heartrending' effects of bad decisions, lack of foresight, corrupt influence, even acts of God. Heartrending, a compound word meaning, literally, 'to tear apart violently or be torn apart in this way', captures the image and the fact. Tragedy, in the dramatic sense, involves players on a stage who represent generations. The participants are lost, but tragedy can redeem itself by instructing the audience, instigating dialogue, inspiring change. </p> <p>Americans have never specialised in dialogue, but the American people, in the past, have overcome religious bigotry and class divides to elect unlikely presidential candidates. </p> <p>More recently, in the era soon to be labelled the Bush years, the Republicans, fuelled by vast financial resources and steel-jawed organisation that is perhaps second nature to captains of industry, appropriated the flag, 'family values' and 'homeland security' to further entrench themselves in power. Bush declared an open-ended 'war on terror' in the wake of 9/11 and anointed himself a wartime President. Challenged on all fronts, the Democrats chose candidates that, seemingly, could not win a general election.</p> <p>There was 2000, when Gore ran a wooden, careful campaign until the very last weeks, won the popular vote, ceded the election to the rule of the Electoral College and then, in the attempt to convey the message of global warming to a audience that would listen, went on to win the Nobel Prize and an Academy Award. </p> <p>Eight years later, the Bush administration admits global warming exists, and the Texan who helped fund the Swift Boat campaign against Kerry in 2004, T Boone Pickens, is backing wind turbines: a major new initiative that would harness the wind corridor that runs from west Texas to Canada. Others suggest the construction of vast solar power cells in the deserts of the American Southwest, clean power that could help win a second war for American independence (from foreign oil). In 2000 and 2004, vast numbers of Americans voted against their own economic interests over 'hot button' issues like abortion and gay marriage. Red and blue states seemed entrenched realities and the polarisation of the electorate seemed complete.<br>But wait. The endless war has caught up with Bush. The Republican plan for the war has failed, despite the 'surge', and the powers behind the throne find themselves mired in a 'don't look now' quagmire: an oil/ failing economy/ war(s) on terror nightmare in which friend and foe alike are funded by drug money and the price of oil has immediate, disastrous effects on the economy. People juggling two low-wage jobs can't afford to get to work in the rural counties and sprawling exurbs, the population centres where public transportation is lacking and highways are meant for drivers and their cars. Unemployment is high and the banking industry isn't lending money. </p> <p>Education budgets have been slashed and slashed again. Uncertainty runs rampant; all bets are off. Americans lack confidence (and health insurance) for a reason. We've seen how this government reacts to immense challenges. Bush's administration responded to 9/11 by fighting the wrong war and fighting it wrong. </p> <p>Torture, always an ineffective means of gaining reliable information, became offshore, unofficial policy, a deadly karmic boomerang. Reservists and troops fighting the war saw their deployments extended and extended again. The flag-draped coffins of American soldiers are not photographed, but the images from New Orleans could not be stopped. Government could not respond quickly or successfully to Katrina, a natural disaster exacerbated by human error. Republicans can organise elections, but can we trust them to organise relief? Disaster relief? Economic relief? Long term relief from the oil imbroglio, and all the other 'confusing, messy, complicated situations that (may) involve disagreement and intrigue'? Can government, in short, provide leadership? </p> <p>Not this government. The Bush years have ushered in a general, societal disbelief and disillusion in government, a return to the nadir of confidence associated with Nixon and the post-Watergate era. For the first time in decades, red and blue states, Republicans, Democrats, Independents agree: this isn't working. No one is winning and everyone is losing.</p> <p>And now? Fasten your seatbelts: this bumpy ride promises plenty of heroic struggle. Hillary Clinton would have made a good President, but the baggage she could not put down proved too heavy. McCain rolled the dice and pleased conservative fundamentalists with his cynical, bizarre VP choice, Sarah Palin, whose practised portrayal of herself is a big hit on SNL, but a dark turn for America. The ah shucks family values hockey mom who made sure bars in Alaska are open until 5am is an unleashed, race-baiting attack dog who plays to old fears, white guilt and paranoia. World wide depression threatens, and one small town Southerner interviewed by the New York Times was quoted as saying he faulted Obama, not for being black, but for being multi-racial, when the Bible instructs against 'mixing one blood with another'. The unknown in this race, in which Obama won every debate, looks and is 'presidential' in his bearing, his tone, his arguments, is whether the race factor, and the rumour-mongering in which Republicans have desperately engaged, will result in the so-called 'Bradley Effect'. If the polls are misleadingly optimistic, and too many Americans vote their fears despite clear evidence that McCain is angry and embittered and will do anything, say anything, allow anything, to win, the election could be lost. America could lose, and the ripple effect of that loss would continue the downward spiral of a country once respected around the world.</p> <p>I strongly support Barack Obama and make no secret of it here. He is eloquent, innovative, truly engaged. He writes his own books. Bicultural and biracial, he's been called upon to prove himself again and again in two cultures, within two racial communities. He generates intense excitement in widely diverse quadrants of the American electorate and throughout the world. His election would immediately change global perceptions of America, as has, to some degree, his candidacy. I don't agree that he 'wouldn't survive in Washington' as President. Would such an 'inexperienced' individual have succeeded against enormous odds to win nomination and run for President? Obama is a team player and an excellent judge of talent who has, in T Boone Pickens's words, 'run a hell of a race'. I have a feeling that Obama agrees with Pickens that offshore drilling does not comprise an energy plan, and that 'if you're importing 70 per cent of your oil, you have a security problem'.</p> <p>To win, Obama must pull in enormous numbers of American voters too uninvolved to vote, and young voters who haven't participated in the past. Disenfranchised voters, some of whom must now produce driver's licences to cast their ballots, must be heard. Will they? And Americans struggling to get by, Americans who have not enjoyed privileges common to those in government, must vote their interests, not their prejudice. If Obama wins, inclusive, careful progress is possible. If McCain wins, he will win by default, for all the wrong reasons.</p> <h2>Patrick McGrath</h2> <p><strong>Winner of the Premio Flaiano Prize in Italy for his 2000 novel Martha Peake. A number of his books have been adapted for the cinema including his 1990 novel Spider which was filmed by David Cronenberg. He lives in New York.</strong></p> <p>Two or three weeks ago, which seems an eternity in this fraught, interminable presidential campaign, Paul Krugman wrote in the New York Times that the McCain-Palin attack-dog approach to electioneering made Bush-Cheney 2000 look like something out of a civics class. A McCain administration, he argued, would not be a continuation of Bush-Cheney. It would be much, much worse.</p> <p>A sobering thought. To list in 800 words everything cynical, immoral, illegal, incompetent, dumb, deceitful, vicious and unconstitutional that's been said or done by the current administration would be impossible. It started with a stolen election. One Saturday late in the year 2000, a day many of us will not forget, the Republican-dominated Supreme Court aborted the Florida vote recount. The blow struck home with sickening impact: there was no place else to go. This was the final court of appeal. </p> <p>We then watched with growing dismay as George Bush, a blustering, incurious, smirking man driven by a far-right political ideology and rabidly doctrinaire religious beliefs assumed the presidency. We listened to him as he mangled the English language. At first it was even amusing. But if he can't speak in sentences, so ran the deeper anxiety, can he think in sentences? Can he think at all? As we were to learn, you don't need to think if you can trust your gut. The politics of stupidity had begun. </p> <p>Things were quiet for a while. Then came the attacks of 9/11. It took George Bush four weeks to get forces into Afghanistan. Clearly he had little interest in pursuing the man responsible. The Bushes had long enjoyed mutually advantageous relations with the bin Laden family and other wealthy Saudis. The administration began instead to hammer home the false linkage of Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, so as to legitimise the war they really wanted to fight. By hook and by crook they got their war.</p> <p>But how badly they mismanaged it. The disastrous decisions of the American proconsul in Baghdad, Paul Bremer, in May 2003 provoked an insurgency that was by no means inevitable. In the smoke and blood that followed \u2013 tens of thousands dead so far, almost five million displaced, the treasures of an ancient culture looted and destroyed \u2013 the Bush administration created a plunder economy of staggering corruption. From that economy the likes of Halliburton, Vice President Cheney's corporate alma mater, reaped vast profits. </p> <p>Meanwhile the Bush people manipulated the terrorist threat so as to sustain domestic support for both the war and an unconstitutional expansion of presidential powers. Over the next years it emerged that they illegally wiretapped American citizens, turned the justice department into a wing of the executive branch, and flouted the Geneva Conventions. Torture of prisoners was approved at the highest levels of government. Rights of habeas corpus were arbitrarily suspended. When evidence of these and other instances of criminality began properly to emerge, popular outrage was exacerbated by intense frustration. The media and the congress had for far too long been silent, swept up in a jingoistic frenzy cynically orchestrated by the White House. They were desperate not to be seen as unpatriotic. </p> <p>Anger alternated with disillusion. The country became unrecognisable to many of its own citizens, and a vertiginous sense of moral dislocation crept into the American soul. There was widespread incredulity that a US President should even have to deny that torture \u2013 by the military, by the CIA \u2013 was occurring on his watch. As the revelations piled up, so the revulsion, the outrage, the frustration and disbelief grew more acute. The mood was further exacerbated by the tragically inadequate federal response to Hurricane Katrina's destruction of New Orleans in the fall of 2005. </p> <p>Over the last few months we have mellowed a little. The manifest lame duckery of George Bush's presidency has been a source of quiet satisfaction to many. With tentative hope, and no little trepidation, we've watched a Democratic candidate emerge who possesses the temperament, the intellect, the wisdom and gravitas to begin the work of undoing the wreckage and horror of this long nightmare. In giddy private moments we anticipate the prospect of the inauguration of President Barack Obama. </p> <p>But we learn now that George Bush hasn't finished with us quite yet. The neoconservative economic policies he so vigorously championed have produced widespread collapse in the financial markets. The recession just now getting underway will create enormous global hardship for years to come. We can only pray it's the last malodorous exhalation of this disgraced and unloved President as he skulks out the door. We believe our man can fix his mess, but small wonder we're jumpy. The alternative, McCain-Palin, is unthinkable. More of the Bush nightmare, or some still worse variant of it \u2013 again?</p>",
  "<p>This has been a week in which Britain has come together. Through the mists of economic and environmental collapse, we have stumbled upon a beacon of hope that, while briefly setting fire to our trousers, has also lit a path of unity. We have formed a rare national consensus, a determination to stand side by side in the name of something we all believe in and agree upon. Not since the Second World War have we felt such moral certainty, such comforting, righteous anger. </p> <p>We will let the world know that, if there's one thing our country stands for, it's this: we don't think people should ring up respected actors and say they've had sex with their granddaughters. And not only do we all think that people shouldn't do that, we also all firmly believe that when they do, they shouldn't then put it on the radio. Everyone thinks this now - even the people that did it. Brilliant.</p> <p>Of course the consensus-hating cynics would say that we've merely lathered ourselves into such a hysterical fever that we've spent a week repeating and re-repeating a conclusion so bleedin' obvious that Sybil Fawlty should be answering questions on it on Mastermind. They'd say we've taken a lapse in taste and judgment that was egregious but, by any reasonable definition, not particularly harmful, and which has been apologised for by everyone concerned and turned it into an excuse for a moral crusade. </p> <p>That, in a country racked by social and economic problems that cannot be blamed on a couple of celebrities, we've grasped at a tiny issue purely for the assuaging effect of its ethical clarity. That we've allowed some people to disguise their envy and rage at two men's success and wealth as concern for the feelings of a much-loved elderly actor. But those cynics are just killjoys who won't accept what a fantastic step forward for our civilisation we've collectively made. It's right up there with when we all insightfully concluded that it's a shame when a princess dies in a car crash.</p> <p>I'm sure we can now move on to even bolder collective assertions: 'Kids shouldn't ring doorbells and then run away'; 'Post Office closures in rural areas cause widespread inconvenience'; 'Donkey homelessness is a crying shame.' Human homelessness is a bit more ambiguous, so it's probably best to steer clear of that. I mean the humans concerned might have been unruly at school or taken heroin - before you know it, they'll be on the radio claiming to have given Yootha Joyce's great-nephew a blowjob - but donkeys should definitely have somewhere to live. And I bet there are 30,000 people just begging to complain about any contention that they shouldn't.</p> <p>Because it's been a particularly lovely week for those 30,000 and rising who've found the time in their undoubtedly busy schedules to thank the BBC for taking the trouble to offend them. Obviously, 29,998 of them missed the broadcast, but thanks to the miracle of YouTube and our dispassionate, fact-printing media, they've all had the opportunity to catch up and get their fix of what offends them.</p> <p>They're an odd bunch, these people who actually enjoy being offended. Some would call them perverts but I, in common with much of the media, think that in our new inclusive society, their fetish should be indulged. In fact, live and let live, it should be celebrated. It's harmless, if incredibly weird, and they're an important and growing demographic. In fact, I'm thinking of pitching a TV show specifically targeted at them called Why Don't You All Go and Fuck Yourselves!? I imagine it'll be a hit.</p> <p>And the fun doesn't stop there. As well as us all being able to hold close to us the warming thought that we shouldn't leave rude answerphone messages, a significant minority of 'liberals' (you know, musicians, comedians, pornographers and the like - I count myself in this group) can be further comforted by their own little consensusette that too much fuss has been made. 'Too much is being written about it,' we write about it. 'It's ridiculous - no one mentions anything else!' we cry, not mentioning anything else. </p> <p>The truth is that this whole farrago has been a hell of a lot of fun for all but about four people in the entire world and that's more than can be said about the earthquake in Pakistan or the fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo or the terrorist bombings in India.</p> <p>But all good things come to an end and, in this case, as in so many, the joy dies with the involvement of politicians. Apart from the fact that you'd think Gordon Brown and David Cameron would want to seem too busy to concern themselves with a Radio 2 show that went wrong, it's never a good idea for politicians to get involved with comedy. From Margaret Thatcher's Yes Minister sketch to Tony Blair's 'Am I Bovvered?' appearance, their attempts to associate themselves with humour have generally been awful. The reason for this is that they don't really care what's funny.</p> <p>Being funny involves taking risks and no politician, except possibly Boris Johnson, can understand why anyone would take the slightest risk of public disapproval in order to get a laugh. They're about power; they don't understand the instinct to amuse and that's why Vince Cable's pretty unfunny remark about Gordon Brown being transformed 'from Stalin to Mr Bean' has led to his being acclaimed a great parliamentary wit. Well, it might make them fall about in the Commons, but it would barely raise a smirk at Wimbledon, where even a pigeon perching on the net gets guffaws.</p> <p>Now the risks taken in Russell Brand's offending radio broadcast are pretty baffling, it must be said, and what happened was wrong, as both Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand accept. But the instinct to take risks is vital to being funny and is why Ross and Brand are so successful and I'm confident will continue to be. Comedians can't self-censor before their every remark or they won't get laughs - politicians must or they won't get votes.</p> <p>The latter could not be worse placed to judge the successes and failures of the former and if, as a result of this absurd furore, the 'on message' word-watching of politics is imposed on comedy, then we may none of us crack a smile again.</p>",
  "<p>The 21st century began late for America, on 11 September 2001. Before that day, the US still defined its role in the world with reference to ideological triumph in the Cold War that had dominated the century just passed. It was the planet's only superpower and saw itself as a popular champion of global democracy. Few expected the nation to come under attack, least of all the man who had been installed in the White House a year earlier. In 2000, George W Bush was uninterested in foreign affairs. He was ill-equipped to be the first US President of the new millennium. </p> <p>Mr Bush found moral purpose in response to terrorism, modelling his response on Cold War rhetoric as a battle between good and evil. But he will leave office unable to claim victory. Meanwhile, foreign entanglements led him to neglect economic and social policy. He inherited a budget surplus of $236bn, which was spent on defence and tax cuts for the rich, leaving a deficit of nearly $500bn as the country enters a recession. It is a sad legacy after two terms in office.</p> <p>So it is no surprise that opinion polls show voters ready to punish the Republican party. Even if John McCain pulls off a surprise victory, beating Barack Obama to the White House, he will have to govern in deference to a Democratic Congress. </p> <p>For the Senator John McCain of 2007, that would not be a problem. He had a reputation for pragmatic bipartisanship and principled opposition to the excesses of the Bush administration. He sponsored campaign finance reform; he decried state-sanctioned torture; he backed measures to halt climate change; he opposed unaffordable tax cuts. At the start of the campaign, Democrats feared Mr McCain would woo voters in the centre ground, while conservatives feared he would betray their agenda of moral activism against abortion, gun control and gay marriage.</p> <p>Neither fear was justified. The John McCain of 2008 has abandoned the centre. There have been rightward shifts on climate change and tax, but the change is mostly a matter of tone. Mr McCain has tried to portray Barack Obama as an unpatriotic socialist. But most extraordinary was the selection of Sarah Palin as a running mate. That was an attempt to position Mr McCain as a tribune in the Culture War between secular liberals and religious conservatives that has paralysed US politics for generations. Sarah Palin represents a strand in Republican thinking that sees the party's mission as perpetual insurgency against an un-American conspiracy run by a cosmopolitan Washington elite. </p> <p>But the job of a Vice-President is to stand in should the Commander-in-Chief be unable to serve. Ms Palin has disqualified herself from that responsibility by showing a woeful grasp of policy. By promoting her, Mr McCain brought his judgment into question. He also made himself a candidate of old divisions, against Mr Obama's promise of unity and change.</p> <p>The long campaign has tested the characters of both candidates, especially when global economic crisis forced them to abandon prepared scripts and perform by instinct. Barack Obama won that contest easily. His policy prescriptions, essentially a redistributive tax agenda, were fairer and more responsible than Mr McCain's panicky pledge of tax-cuts. In style, Mr McCain's reaction was slow and choleric, while Mr Obama's was steely and swift. The Democratic candidate thus refuted what had been the strongest argument against his candidacy - that he lacked leadership stature.</p> <p>That makes for a marked contrast with the diminished and discredited White House incumbent. George W Bush's reign is now recognised, even by non-partisan American commentators, as a colossal failure. He spent two terms misapplying the old foreign policy doctrines of the Cold War to a new security threat and exploiting the old enmities of the Culture Wars to shore up his power.</p> <p>Mr Bush failed the test that history set him: to lead America into the new millennium. America is still waiting for a 21st-century President. It has one ready to serve in Barack Obama.</p>",
  "<p>It was by chance that I found myself in New York on the eve of the presidential election amid deepening gloom about the US and world economy. It so happened that when we planned a family break here, our minds were not on the date of the election; and, let's face it, the pound was riding a lot higher than it is today.</p> <p>Fear about the economy here is palpable. One can't pick up a newspaper without reading about the dire state of General Motors, Chrysler and other household names. Bankruptcy proceedings are threatened and, after the vast sums committed to the attempted rescue of the banking system, pressure grows for very un-free-market government bail-outs for other sectors.</p> <p>The first thing I heard when I turned on the radio was the excited exhortation, 'Don't go bankrupt!'. Some organisation was promising to reconstitute people's credit card debt to their putative advantage; more financial engineering to deal - or not - with the problems caused by previous excesses.</p> <p>Books to re-read on this trip included the two 'Greats': The Great Gatsby and The Great Crash. Gatsby was published in 1926, an evocation of the Jazz Age that preceded the Great Depression; but The Great Crash was not published until 1954, a distance that helped JK Galbraith to provide the perspective which has ensured it has never been out of print.</p> <p>It has always amused me that Nick Carraway, the narrator of The Great Gatsby, works in the bond market but does not feel the need to bore us with the technical details. He tells us that he 'studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour' each evening and that he worked for - wait for it - 'The Probity Trust'. The rest is not history, just one of the greatest novels ever.</p> <p>It is not abundantly obvious that many of the practitioners in the modern financial markets devoted a conscientious hour to studying the dubious 'investments' that nearly brought Western capitalism to its knees. Neither can they have devoted much time - between partying and sidelining more cautious colleagues, who questioned the capitulation of 'banking' to 'marketing' - on The Great Crash in 1929.</p> <p>It is all there, only in the Twenties the equivalent of the sub-prime fiasco was the 'Florida land boom'. Well before Alan Greenspan coined the term 'irrational exuberance', Galbraith warned of 'exhilarant optimism'. And, of course, as the markets have discovered, 'leverage [piling mountains of debt on a slender capital base in a bull market] works both ways... Geometric series are equally dramatic in reverse'.</p> <p>One of Christopher's Dow's conclusions in Major Recessions is 'the bigger the boom, the bigger the bust'. The recent gyrations of the stock market have demonstrated nervousness, fear and even despair about what lies ahead. And there will shortly be an emergency 'global finance summit' in Washington which is, somewhat adventurously, being compared to a 'New Bretton Woods' after the seminal meeting in the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in July 1944.</p> <p>Now, the present world economic crisis - for that is what it is - is 'multi-causal', to put it mildly. 'Irrational exuberance' and 'exhilarant optimism' have interacted with asset-price inflation, with the impact of low-cost China on the world's economy, with huge gyrations in exchange rates and the price of oil, to produce a highly unstable world economy. Countries such as the US and UK have been living beyond their means. Chinese savings have helped to finance the US binge, while China, with an undervalued exchange rate, has relied heavily on exports.</p> <p>So-called 'globalisation' has fostered an interdependence that means Asia has not, as some analysts used to argue, 'decoupled' from the West. So what is China's reaction to the threat of recession in the West? It is to sit on its undervalued exchange rate and to introduce government subsidies for exports.</p> <p>If any attempt at a 'Bretton Woods II' is to be efficacious, participants would do well to note that the fundamental concerns of the original meeting are in danger of returning.</p> <p>The Bretton Woods agreement was essentially about stabilising exchange rates and eventual 'convertibility' of currencies that had been subject to strict wartime controls. As the British economist Sir Alec Cairncross wrote on the 50th anniversary of Bretton Woods: 'The Americans' anxiety to establish early convertibility and eliminate discrimination in trading relationships derived from their view that discrimination, trade restrictions and competitive depreciation were a potent cause of war. Britain, however, saw the source of prewar troubles in the deflationary pressure on the world economy, exerted by an American slump.' </p> <p>Keynes, our principal negotiator at Bretton Woods, feared, in his biographer Robert Skidelsky's words, that 'the market system was liable to collapse into prolonged depression'. Those fears are back; so, given China's recent moves on the exchange rate and export subsidies, are fears about protectionism.</p> <p>There is an awful lot at stake. Although the imminent financial summit will be hosted by George Bush, there will soon be a huge economic weight on the shoulders of the new President. Barack Obama is manifestly more aware of the economic problem; John McCain on TV the other night could not at first even remember the name of George Shultz, the distinguished former Treasury Secretary and Secretary of State, who is backing him.</p> <p>I'll believe the result when I see it. I am old enough to remember how hot favourite Thomas Dewey lost in 1948 and, more recently, how top US reporters wrote Jimmy Carter off before he won in 1976.</p>",
  "<p>In most companies, turning down the founder and chief executive's request to look after a pet project would be a career-stopper for a young engineer on her first assignment. But WL Gore and Associates is not most companies. And Terri Kelly, the engineer in question who became its president and chief executive in 2005 - only the fourth in the company's 50-year history - tells that story to illustrate a couple of Gore's most singular characteristics.</p> <p>At Gore - a $2.4bn, hi-tech materials company that most people know best for the Gore-Tex fabric that waterproofs their anoraks and walking boots - no one can tell any of the company's 8,500 associates what to do. Although there is a structure (divisions, business units and so on) there is no organisation chart, no hierarchy and therefore no bosses. Kelly is one of the few with a title. </p> <p>As she acknowledges, that makes her job rather different from that of most CEOs. Bill Gore, who set up the company with his wife Vieve (short for Genevieve) in the family garage in 1958, wanted to build a firm that was truly innovative. So there were no rule books or bureaucracy. He strongly believed that people come to work to do well and do the right thing. Trust, peer pressure and the desire to invent great products - market-leading guitar strings, dental floss, fuel cells, cardiovascular and surgical applications and all kinds of specialised fabrics - would be the glue holding the company together, rather than the official procedures other companies rely on.</p> <p>Traditionalists looking at Gore wonder how it works. Kelly laughs - as she does frequently - and counters that it works just fine, particularly in chaotic times like these. The financial crisis is also a management crisis and the symptom, she believes, of a wider issue: a deficit of trust. Gore, however, has 'focused on generating value through trust - with our associates [the privately-held company is co-owned by the Gore family and the workforce], suppliers and customers'. Counter-intuitively, the best governance, especially in troubled periods, is the absence of external rules: Gore would rather rely on fiercely motivated people who, having internalised true north, have no fear of challenging leaders to justify decisions, and leaders who know they can't rely on power or status to get themselves out of a fix.</p> <p>In Gore's self-regulating system, all the normal management rules are reversed. In this back-to-front world, leaders aren't appointed: they emerge when they accumulate enough followers to qualify as such. So when the previous group CEO retired three years ago, there was no shortlist of preferred candidates. Alongside board discussions, a wide range of associates were invited to nominate to the post someone they would be willing to follow. 'We weren't given a list of names - we were free to choose anyone in the company,' Kelly says. 'To my surprise, it was me.'</p> <p>Similarly, Gore doesn't have budgets in the sense that most companies do. 'When I joined we didn't have a planning process - budgeting wasn't in the vocabulary,' she says. Gore now does a better job of planning investment and forecasting, she maintains, but it still tries to avoid the games-playing and inflexibility of the traditional budget. 'Budgets hinder associates from reacting in real time to changing circumstances,' she says. Most of Gore's investment will only have an impact years ahead: 'We don't want folks making short-term decisions that are not in the best interest of the long term. The planning and investment horizon have to match.'</p> <p>Gore also seems to reverse the usual notions of economies of scale. Kelly cites Bill Gore's counter-intuitive belief in the need 'to divide so that you can multiply'. When Gore units grow to around 200 people, they are usually split up. These small plants are organised in clusters or campuses, ideally with a dozen or so sites in close enough proximity to permit knowledge synergies, but still intimate and separate enough to encourage ownership and identity. An accountant might complain that creates duplication of costs; Gore believes those are more than offset by the benefits smallness brings.</p> <p>A Gore lifer, Kelly joined the company as a process engineer in 1983 after graduating with distinction from the University of Delaware with a degree in mechanical engineering. (It's perhaps no coincidence that, like leaders in many of the most interesting of today's companies, she has no formal business education - and no regrets at having missed out.) She cut her teeth as a product specialist with the military fabrics business - a unit she eventually led - before moving to head the global fabrics division. Here she helped set up a fabrics manufacturing plant in Shenzhen, China, Gore's first fabrics plant in Asia, now at the centre of one of the company's fastest growing operations. While leading the fabrics division, Kelly also served on the enterprise team overseeing Gore's strategic direction. </p> <p>Is lack of experience outside the company a disadvantage, or an essential qualification for running Gore? It is hard to imagine an outsider being able to understand, let alone manage, a distinctive culture such as this. Kelly argues that the ability to develop its own ways of doing things is crucial to the company's success. Proof of the importance of the 'Gore factor' is the company's consistently high ranking in 'good places to work' surveys - the UK arm, with units in Livingston and Dundee, headed the Sunday Times Best Companies to Work For list four years in a row.</p> <p>Most companies find safety in numbers, ending up broadly resembling their industry counterparts in strategy, products and management processes. For the consequences, look no further than the credit crunch, which has overwhelmed the copycats in the financial sector. </p> <p>Kelly, on the other hand, spends most of her time on emphasising difference and preventing people from reverting to the conventional wisdom that in other firms would be the norm. This is a fine line to tread. Protecting the core heritage is one thing; not allowing anything to change is another. Where Gore has tripped up in the past, she says, has been in confusing the core values, which don't change, with the practices for getting things done, which do. So in the late 1980s there was a furious argument over whether 'structure' was bureaucracy and therefore bad and counter-cultural. 'We didn't pay enough attention to accountability and decision-making and who was actually leading. It was a good exercise for us to understand the need to distinguish between practices, which change with time, and who we really are, which doesn't. Otherwise you're paralysed.'</p> <p>Although at present, Gore is being prudent with investment plans, cutting back on hiring in areas most exposed to the downturn, Kelly is not rowing back from the promise that the company will double in size over the next few years. As a private company, Gore doesn't release detailed figures, but it is no secret that the balance sheet is strong and the company has been in the black every year in its history. It doesn't lack opportunities, whether geographical or technical, nor is it constrained by ability to invest.</p> <p>Growth, then, will largely be dictated by its ability to assimilate new people. 'It's all about how we bring new folks in, get them to understand our values and focus leadership on fitting it all together,' Kelly says. 'For our associates to know we aren't constrained by markets or finance, just by our own culture - that's a good problem to have. It's all in our own hands.'</p> <h2>The CV</h2> <p><strong>Name</strong> Terri Kelly<br><strong>Age</strong> 45 <br><strong>Career </strong>1983, graduates summa cum laude from the University of Delaware; joins Gore as process engineer, becoming leader of military fabrics business; 1993, becomes one of three global leaders for its fabrics division, helps set up firm's first Asian fabrics plant in China; 2005, chosen as Gore's fourth president and CEO by peers <br><strong>Family </strong>One of four mechanical-engineering daughters of an engineer father.

  "<p>National Trust members have vowed to continue their fight against the charity over a planned housing development on one of its heritage sites. The members lost a vote to scrap the plans at the trust's AGM yesterday but are now planning to call an emergency meeting of the trust, which they hope will see off the development. </p> <p>The long-running protest centres on the charity's plans to build a new village in the grounds of the Erddig estate, near Wrexham in north Wales, which will be made up of 223 houses and flats, including 55 affordable homes. </p> <p>The trust maintains that the new development is necessary to secure future funding for the upkeep of the estate, which was bequeathed to it in 1973 by its last squire, Philip Yorke. But opposition to the plans has been growing for two years both from locals who are concerned the development will destroy the character of the area and from members around the country who are concerned about the trust's new role as housing developer.</p> <p>'It is a breach of the National Trust's duty to protect our heritage and the rural environment,' said protester Aran Jones, one of the 352 to sign a petition against the plans. 'They are acting like speculative developers rather than a heritage organisation.'</p> <p>Only last week the National Trust announced that it would take a more positive environmental stance with a focus on protecting green spaces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland after a survey of its members revealed that 94 per cent want the charity to become more involved in local green spaces. </p> <p>'My objection is about the hypocrisy,' said Marc Jones, Plaid Cymru councillor in Wrexham and trust member. 'The charity's chairman announced it should spend its reserves buying up greenfield land to protect that land from government housing development, yet the same trust is going full speed ahead to build a commuter housing estate.'</p> <p>Two resolutions about Erddig were put forward at the AGM. The first was to scrap the development and the second was to remove the directors who are behind what the protesters describe as 'a major switch in policy from conservation to speculative property development'.</p> <p>The resolutions were defeated, but the Rhostyllen group is resilient, claiming it expected the decision because of a voting system they say gives the trust's chairman 'a proxy block vote of several thousand'.</p> <p>Now the group says it is confident it has enough support to press ahead and call an emergency meeting of the National Trust. To do this it will need the support of 8,000 members. 'We are very confident that we have this level of support,' said protester Carrie Harper. 'We know that many people have resigned their membership in protest and others have contacted us to say they are disgusted by what the trust is doing.'</p> <p>Residents of Rhostyllen have been running a 'Not on Erddig' campaign for almost two years . Locals also argue that the low-cost homes in the development will be affordable only to outsiders coming in from Liverpool and Manchester and not for locals. Cymuned, a Welsh-language pressure group supporting the Rhostyllen protest, claims the plans violate the wishes Philip Yorke made when he donated the estate. The National Trust maintains that Yorke left the property in the knowledge that some of the land to be sold was developable.</p> <p>'Where we take on land, we have to ensure there is a potential source of funding and it was always intended this land could and would be sold,' said Peter Nixon, director of conservation at the National Trust.</p> <p>Things came to a head in January when local people voted against the plans in an official referendum organised by the council. 'The National Trust director in Wales said they would bide by popular will but they totally ignored this referendum result,' said Jones. </p> <p>The trust may yet be forced to reconsider its future direction as this is not the first time it has faced opposition to a planned development. Five years ago it faced the wrath of locals over its plans to demolish a derelict hospital in the grounds of the Cliveden Estate in Berkshire, in order to build houses. The development went ahead despite this opposition. </p> <p>The mounting concern over this move into the arena of housing development was underlined by another resolution at yesterday's AGM. Seven people put forward the resolution, backed by the required 50 other members, asking the trust to ensure sustainability be at the heart of all its decisions in the future.</p> <p>'The Cliveden Village was a missed opportunity; it is not large enough to sustain any of its own services and every journey to and from its rural setting will have to be by car,' claimed the group. 'We call on the trust to take great care in controlling future developments.'</p> <p>The trust recommended members to vote for that resolution, unlike the two concerning Erddig, and it was passed.</p>",
  "<p>A leading supermarket has been forced to ditch a healthy eating campaign at the eleventh hour after discovering its staff could be individually prosecuted under EU regulations.</p> <p>Sainsbury's planned to launch Halloween 'zombie brains' cauliflowers, 'witches fingers' carrots and 'ogres toenails' cucumbers using under-sized and misshapen vegetables that are currently banned from sale. </p> <p>'Because Halloween is focused on sweets and snacks for children, we thought we would add a healthy message and use the surplus vegetables,' said a spokesman. 'We knew it was illegal but we were happy to take that risk as a company and say: \"Bring it on, EU.\"'</p> <p>'But last week we discovered it wouldn't actually be us as a company that would be prosecuted. It would be individual store managers. And, obviously we could not ask our staff to risk a criminal record for the good of the company.'</p> <p>The supermarket chain has now launched a 'Save Our British Fruit and Veg' campaign, in a bid to force the EU to relax its strict specifications on selling cheaper 'imperfect' fresh produce. </p> <p>The retailer has written to the EU Agriculture Commissioner, Mariann Fischer Boel, and Environment Secretary Hilary Benn expressing its concerns over 'bonkers' regulations and has launched an online poll for customers to join the fight for 'wonky' fruit and veg.</p> <p>Strict EU regulations dictate the shape, size and appearance of 36 fruits and vegetables. For example, it is illegal for supermarkets to sell a cauliflower less than 11cm in diameter, carrots that are forked (with more than one root) or onions with less than two-thirds covered in skin.</p> <p>The regulations have long caused outrage among farmers, retailers and environmentalists, including the Prince of Wales, whose own 'knobbly' organic carrots have been rejected for sale. </p> <p>The clamour for cheaper vegetables during the credit crunch has forced the EU to re-examine the regulations. At a meeting on 12 November, commission officials are expected to vote to relax directives on 26 of the fruits and vegetables - though the change will not come into force until July next year.</p> <p>However Sainsbury's said it wanted any decision fast-tracked so it could legally sell this winter's produce as the credit crunch continues to bite. It is also calling for the regulations to be eased on all fruits and vegetables, as restrictions would still remain on apples, tomatoes and lettuces. The regulations mean that an estimated 20 per cent of British farmers' produce goes to waste.</p> <p>'We have been struggling to fit a square peg in a round hole for too long now when it comes to conforming to the more controversial elements of the EU regulations,' said Sue Henderson, the supermarket's brand integrity and sustainability manager. </p> <p>'We're not allowed to use up to 20 per cent of what's produced in this country and in the current crunch climate, we cannot continue to waste this much food before it even leaves the farms. Buying wonky veg would have saved cash-strapped Britons up to 40 per cent on some items such as carrots. It not only saves money, it also reduces waste and supports our British farmers. </p> <p>'We strongly believe that now is the right time to challenge the impact these regulations have on our customers' choice.'</p> <p>Richard Hirst, horticulture board chairman at the National Farmers' Union, said it supported the campaign. 'Farmers and growers work extremely hard to produce quality food, but nature does not always comply with a perfectly rounded apple and poker-straight carrot. People should be given the chance to buy odd-shaped fruit and veg as they taste just as good.'</p> <p>Sainsbury's said it had intended to sell its Halloween range up to 40 per cent cheaper than the standard produce. Gordon Silvester, manager of the chain's Lordshill branch in Southampton, said: 'I think it is totally crazy that I could have ended up with a criminal conviction - all for selling a wonky carrot.'</p> <p>Siobhan Freegard, founder of the parenting website <a href=\"http://www.netmums.com\">Netmums.com</a> said she was '100 per cent' behind the campaign. 'We want our children to know about and enjoy the wonky, often amusing shapes that nature presents us with. Our children come in all shapes and sizes and we are quite happy to have our veg come that way too. It's natural.</p> <p>'This obsession with perfection causes children to become over fussy and ready to toss aside fruit that is perfectly good but not waxwork perfect to look at.'</p>",
  "<h2>McCurrie's FO blogs? They're hot stuff</h2> <p>It is quite safe, the thinking must have gone, when the plan for official Foreign Office blogs was mooted. They're going to be written by diplomats - being careful with words will be second nature to the bloggers. And so it has turned out. For the most part, you can read boring sentences bashed out by the likes of David Miliband. But last week, Marianne McCurrie, a 'global diplomat' who is posted to whichever embassy around the world is supposedly under-staffed at any given time, has bucked the trend.</p> <p>She writes, in a style befitting a gap-year postcard: 'You join me in one of the more cushy postings - Victoria in the Seychelles.

It's probably also a surprise, since in March, she wrote: 'At the end of 2003, I met a successful woman writer who'd read in the papers about the end of my marriage to Jonathan Dimbleby. \"I hope you're going to write a book about it!\" she said with some glee ... maybe her counsel made commercial sense, but I'm glad I didn't take it. There's enough personal misery swilling around the shelves of bookshops without me adding to the woe. Surely some details are best kept private ...' Mooney's agent boasts that she has accepted a 'very large five-figure sum' from publisher Ebury.</p> <h2>Brand awareness</h2> <p>MPs keen to criticise the BBC for paying Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross spent a further \u00a31,500 of public money tabling a series of early day motions (\u00a3300 per motion) last week.

Taylor suggests the presenters' behaviour was 'puerile' and 'predictable'.

  "<p>Backstage at the Dior ready-to-wear catwalk show in Paris last month, the biggest behind-the-scenes celebrity - excepting Galliano himself - is mostly to be found on her hands and knees in a dangerous cat's cradle of hairdryer cables, slathering moisturiser onto the bare legs of 45 models.</p> <p>'People think this is a glamorous job,' grins Pat McGrath, the woman Vogue has called 'the most influential make-up artist in the world', looking up from between a girl's feet. She spends the pre-show hour dashing through toxic clouds of hairspray between the 22 make-up artists working under her direction, scrutinising the details of each girl's face and legs as the minutes tick away to curtain up: 'More on the brows here!' she calls, tilting one face up to the light, before moving on to the next, whose body make-up is wrong - 'Get it all off and start again!' - and the next, whose hairpiece isn't staying put. Time is so tight that McGrath and her team are still attending the girls as they are getting dressed to go on stage, dabbing and primping from the portable kits strapped to their persons with an air of organised emergency, like a slightly camp triage team.</p> <p>In the midst of what looks to me, experiencing my first fashion show, like irremediable chaos, 38-year-old McGrath is a stately presence, a beacon of calm who manages to mute the rising panic in everyone around her. She finds time to chat to journalists and camera crews while fixing foundation mishaps, reassures anxious models and soothes fretful hairdressers, and miraculously the show goes up almost on time with everyone looking as damn near perfect as possible. I never once catch her without a smile on her face; she seems to be positively enjoying the atmosphere of imminent catastrophe and remains refreshingly down to earth amid the inevitable mincing and preening of the fashion world hangers-on. 'I thrive on the adrenaline,' she says afterwards, grinning broadly. 'I actually do enjoy that side of it, knowing that at any moment something could go disastrously wrong.' Asked if anything has gone momentously wrong in recent memory, she only laughs. 'All the time! But you wouldn't know. And even if I'm not calm on the inside, you'll never know it.'</p> <p>The Dior show is only one of 26 she will do in the three weeks of the autumn season; for the past seven years she has counted 20 designers among her regular clients, including Stella McCartney, Prada, Miu Miu, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and on occasion her schedule in Paris is so tight that she has to be couriered between shows on the back of a motorbike to dodge the traffic. Some of her creations have made fashion history; the Egypt show she worked on for Dior in 2004 was a particular favourite, with the faces pasted in gold and jewel-colours like Tutankhamun's death mask. Past shows, in which she has taken inspiration from portraits of Elizabeth I, kabuki masks or modern art, have drawn on her innovative use of bold colour and placed the emphasis on the high-art side of her work, though she's equally at home with high-street fashion. </p> <p>'What first attracted me to fashion was the wildest clothes and make-up,' she explains later, over tea in a cafe near her London home in Maida Vale (she also has an apartment and an office in New York, where she spends most of her time). 'I loved those shows where you're able to dream, I loved the fantasy element of it, because even the so-called reality of fashion is a kind of fantasy. But that's what draws you into fashion, so when people say, \"Oh my God, I could never wear that\", I'm like, yes you will. Because no matter how insane something looks in the shows, there's always an idea there that will filter down to the high street in a different version eventually.'</p> <p>Fashion and beauty have been part of McGrath's life for as long as she can remember; her Jamaican mother, Jean, was obsessed with clothes and cosmetics, and a combination of thrift and the lack of make-up for black skin fuelled her creativity. From her, the young Pat learnt to experiment with products, sweeping lipstick over eyes and cheeks and mixing her own face creams, as well as a feel for picking out fabrics. 'My mum had no background in fashion but she'd taught herself to sew and she was amazing, she used to make all my clothes from designer patterns. We'd be going to church in Calvin Klein military at the age of 11.' She giggles. Growing up in Northampton in the Seventies and Eighties, she and her brother and sister were dragged endlessly around vintage shops. 'We hated it, we'd all go in there like this,' she says, holding her nose, 'because of that vintage smell, and my mum'd be going, \"Look at this, it's 1920s!\" And she'd take us every Friday to buy make-up, looking for colours that would work on black skin. In those days you'd be lucky if you could find one eyeshadow with heavy pigment.'</p> <p>McGrath describes her family life as 'very religious, very conservative'; her teenage rebellion was to develop a fascination with the Blitz Kids (Boy George, Marilyn, Spandau Ballet, famed for their outr\u00e9 make-up), whom she used to follow around the King's Road when she sneaked away to London. 'We thought we were New Romantics, we'd get changed on the train and try to get into all those clubs,' she says, shaking her head in mock embarrassment at the memory. 'I was doing an art foundation course at college so I'd tell my mum I was going to art galleries. Then I'd get home and open my bag and she'd say, \"My God, there's so much smoke in those galleries\", and I'd be like, I know Mum, everyone smokes in the city, it's terrible.'</p> <p>She had been planning to do a fashion degree, but the club scene proved a more useful entr\u00e9e; she got to know the stylist Kim Bowen, one-time muse of the Blitz kids set. When McGrath said she wanted to be a make-up artist, Bowen invited her to come along and watch shoots for The Face and i-D. She took a day job as a receptionist at the Department of Transport, and drifted into helping out on music videos and magazine shoots at night through friends and people she met in the clubs. </p> <p>'Kim would call me up and say, \"Have you got a book together yet?\"' McGrath remembers, 'and although I loved the fun we had on set, I just never quite got it together and went for it. So the jobs would always go to someone better known, and eventually I just resigned myself to the idea that I would never make it. There was one evening when I was just sitting in my living room in the dark and I thought, \"I'm never going to become a make-up artist, I'm finished, I'm going to have to get a real job\", because at that point my mum was saying, \"Maybe you should take a hint\".'</p> <p>It was at precisely that moment that the fairy-tale break came. 'The phone rang and it was someone asking if I wanted to go on tour in Japan with Caron Wheeler from Soul II Soul. I'd done her make-up one Sunday afternoon three years earlier as a favour, and she took my number saying she'd call me some time. And that was it - I left my job and went to Japan for three months, scared to death. I cried all the way there because I'd never been on a plane before and I was terrified.'</p> <p>After that, she was offered 'every music job in London', and gradually moved into fashion, working first with Jil Sander and Hussein Chalayan, and forging enduring creative partnerships with individual photographers, first Paolo Roversi, with whom she worked for French and Italian Vogue, and later Steven Meisel, who uses her for all his editorial work in New York.</p> <p>But if there was a degree of diversity in the music industry in the mid-Nineties, the fashion world was still almost entirely white. Naomi Campbell, whom McGrath counts as a friend ('I started working with her in the early days and we've grown up together') was the only internationally recognised black supermodel, a situation that has barely changed in the past 10 years. </p> <p>'There has been a lot of campaigning on that issue and, no, it isn't fair,' McGrath says, when I ask about the lack of diversity on the catwalks and magazines. 'Thank God we've got Jourdan [Dunn] and Sessilee [Lopez] coming through, and I think there is the beginning of a change happening. I have noticed that over this past year.'</p> <p>She speaks carefully on this issue, and I get the sense that she doesn't want to come across as too militant. Even so, I say, out of 45 girls at the Dior show I saw, two were black and one south-east Asian; all the others were Identikit blondes.</p> <p>'It's not enough,' McGrath agrees, 'and the change is too slow. It's up to people like myself to keep pushing.'</p> <p>Does she feel her profile serves as inspiration for young black women who might otherwise have thought that the fashion industry was only for posh skinny white girls, \u00e0 la Amanda from Ugly Betty.</p> <p>'Absolutely,' she says, nodding emphatically, 'I'm always stopped by girls on the street who tell me, \"Oh my God, I love what you do, I'm going to be a make-up artist\" - they always give me their phone numbers. </p> <p>'The other night I was at a party at the O2 and these two young black girls came up with their faces all done up with the look from one of the shows. They said \"We always look for your stuff on the web and we copied it\". It is really important for young women to see that you can work in fashion, it's open to everyone.'</p> <p>This confidence, she says, is another legacy from her mother, who was a firm believer that everyone had the right to enjoy fashion.</p> <p>'She'd bring me to London to the designer shops to look at the new collections and she'd press the buzzer - remember when you had to press the buzzer?' she giggles. 'She'd be ringing the bell and the woman would come to the door and turn grey, and my mum would just stand there until she opened. Then my mum'd say, \"My daughter would like to try on that dress in the window\". And I'd be shaking, trying on all these clothes we could never afford, but my mum would be really firm about it, she'd say, \"They've got to get used to real people shopping in here\". And look at the industry today - the injection of designer fashion into the high street.'</p> <p>Like fellow celebrity make-up artists Bobbi Brown, Fran\u00e7ois Nars and Laura Mercier, McGrath is also at work on her own high-street cosmetic brand, which will be launched in around 18 months' time - she previously worked with Armani, developing his cosmetic collection and also holds the impressively titled post of global creative design director for Procter &amp; Gamble, developing the Cover Girl and Max Factor lines, a job she describes as a 'dream come true'.</p> <p>She confesses to being something of a workaholic, often working 10-hour days (double that during fashion weeks) and keeping a tight rein on how much she indulges in the party side of the fashion world. 'I do love that aspect, but for me it is more about hard graft,' she says. 'During fashion week a friend called me and said, \"Pat, where are you?\" - there was a huge dinner and I'd completely forgotten, I was in bed.' </p> <p>Though she's single at the moment - her hectic schedule means she is rarely in one city for more than a few days at a time - she says she would like to settle, and have a family in the future. </p> <p>For someone who spends so much time on planes, she has flawless skin. Disappointingly, she has no magic bullet - she travels with suitcases full of products, and says she couldn't possibly single out one that she couldn't live without - but cites all the old advice: good moisturiser, plenty of water. She goes regularly to a dermatologist in New York and says she is paranoid about spots. But the truth, she says, is that good skin is inherited; like her confidence and pride in herself, and her love of experimental fashion and beauty, her skin is one more thing she owes to her late mother. And saying so, she finishes her tea and skitters away to catch another plane.</p>",
  "<p>Old people seeing their life savings going up in smoke; middle-class families unable to meet their mortgage payments; young graduates, their dreams of affluence crushed, obliged to abandon their first homes... these are the new norms in Iceland, whose people, the most hard hit until now by the world's catastrophic financial crisis, are in a state of shock. 'Like the survivors of an earthquake,' said one. 'Our 11 September,' lamented another.</p> <p>Iceland, a miniature caricature of the prosperity without end the developed world seemed until recently to be enjoying, offers suddenly a frightening vision of the pit of despond into which Europe, the United States and the rest of the world's hitherto wealthy nations risk falling. With the country's foreign reserves gone, the greater part of the banking system nationalised and the country declared by the prime minister to be practically bankrupt, </p> <p>Iceland is at the epicentre of a global earthquake whose impact the most crazed participant in the attack on New York's World Trade Center would not have dared to imagine.</p> <p>The national trauma - ex-pressed in shame, anger, fear - comes from the clash between the vast self-satisfaction accumulated over two decades of rampaging growth and the brutal suddenness of the fall. A United Nations report earlier this year identified Iceland as the best country in the world in which to live. A survey published in serious newspapers in 2006 said that the Icelanders (who, contrary to myth, do not have a high suicide rate - it is lower than France's and Australia's) were the happiest people on earth. Today, Iceland's future is at the mercy of the International Monetary Fund, as if the country occupied not the first place in the United Nations Development Programme's latest Human Development Index rankings, but had replaced Sierra Leone in the last. In a measure of the general despair, the government has been flirting with what most Icelanders seem to view as the dire notion of accepting a big loan from Russia, whose people, according to that same survey, are the unhappiest in the world.</p> <p>The criteria used by the UNDP report did not focus only on the fact that this country of 300,000 inhabitants, located in one of the most inhospitable eco-systems on the planet, had managed to achieve the sixth highest GDP per capita in the world. As I found when I went there six months ago to check up on this unlikely marvel, there remains a lot more for the Icelanders to cherish and preserve.</p> <p>The quality of their public health and education systems (even the fleetingly filthy rich saw little need to use private schools or private medicine) may be equalled somewhere, but not surpassed; the state plays a decisive role in ensuring that mothers have the same access to the labour market as fathers, and this in a country that has the highest childbirth rate in Europe; an extraordinarily enlightened attitude towards divorce, in which the overwhelming priority is the welfare of the children, means that the notion of 'broken homes' is something Icelanders read about in foreign magazines; as for clean and renewable energy - hot water from the island's volcanic depths is the principal source of electricity - Iceland is a world leader; and as for a generalised love of reading and music, there is nowhere quite like it.</p> <p>It was for these reasons - far more than for the hip bars and gourmet restaurants and super-cool hotels, amid plenty more visible measures of abundancy in the capital, Reykjavik - that I bought into the conclusions of the UNDP report. My work takes me all over the world and I have lived in eight countries, but never have I encountered such a concentration of open-minded, intelligent, enterprising people as I have in Iceland. </p> <p>Too enterprising, as it turns out. The achievements built up over 1,000 years of human habitation on this windy, chilly island are at risk now, owing to the Viking exuberance that many had chosen to identify as the engine of the Icelandic miracle, as the reason why in half a century Iceland passed from being the poorest country in Europe to one of the richest, with zero unemployment. The president himself, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, had boasted as recently as May, in a speech in London, that the ancestral Viking virtues immortalised in the ancient 'sagas' - the alpha-male derring-do of those fearless bands that ventured out into an unmapped world to plunder and subjugate - were the secret of 'why daring Icelander entrepreneurs are succeeding where others hesitate or fail'. </p> <p>Four weeks ago, with the finance system in freefall, Grimsson underwent a heart operation. He emerged to make a TV appearance in which he begged his compatriots to forgive him for making what - he could see in retrospect - was a buffoonish spectacle of himself as head of a country now perceived globally as an ostentatious upstart, and by some (such as Gordon Brown) as a debt-defaulting pariah. </p> <p>Iceland's bankers, the Viking vanguard, operated in 20 countries (this is a nation, it must be remembered, with a population barely bigger than Hull's) and had bought themselves big businesses in Britain and Denmark (not excluding, as if they were Arab sheikhs or Russian oligarchs, a London football club, West Ham). But in so doing, the national debt outstripped the country's real wealth by a factor of 12. The ties that bind the global banking system broke and the Icelandic bubble burst.</p> <p>The Icelanders are divided between those who chiefly blame the government, for having deregulated the financial laws to such an extent that - short of outright piracy - anything went, and those who blame the bankers, whose extravagance the rest of the citizenry beheld in the spontaneous parties they hosted in the swankier bars of Reykjavik, swilling \u00a31,000- a-bottle champagne as if it were beer.</p> <p>Thorir Bergsson is among those who are inclined to blame the government, reasoning as he does that people whose business it is to do money will by their very nature stretch the boundaries of what the law allows. It is his view that it is up to the government now to come up with a solution to his pressing, and absolutely typical, dilemma.</p> <p>Bergsson, 39, is a chef in what had been until now a successful restaurant in Reykjavik's equivalent of Regent Street (taking into account that Reykjavik from the outside has the feel of a Faroe Island fishing village). Today the clientele is down by 40 per cent, some employees have been let go and he himself is contemplating the prospect of accepting a reduction in his salary. His wife is an anthropologist who works for the Reykjavik city council in a department that deals with immigrants. It is a post that could cease soon to have much relevance.The foreign population, largely from Poland and the Baltic states, is beginning to dwindle, driven elsewhere by the plummeting local currency, the krona. Suddenly, as Bergsson noted, it seems highly likely that Icelanders will find themselves competing for 'the dirty hands' jobs they had imagined they would never have to touch again.</p> <p>But that is not the worst of it. The worst of it is that Bergsson simply cannot pay his monthly mortgage payments, nor those of his car loan, without the four children who live with him and his wife going hungry. The couple have two small children of their own, but each has an adolescent child from a previous relationship - a state of affairs that is not only common in Iceland, it is considered entirely natural. Between the two of them they earn around 850,000 krona a month. That was worth around \u00a37,000 two months ago; now it is worth less than \u00a34,500, and falling. </p> <p>Following their bank's advice, they had opted, as many Icelanders had done, to take out their mortgage in a 'basket' of foreign currencies. In the all-day and all-night light of summer they were making monthly payments of 160,000 krona; the next payment due, as the long black winter sets in, is for 400,000. On the car, Bergsson and his wife have to pay 60,000. 'If we then add the 36 per cent we pay in tax, we're left with practically nothing,' says Bergsson, when we meet for lunch at a city centre restaurant that is otherwise empty at 1.15pm on a Wednesday. 'This is why I am left with no option but to go to the bank and inform them that I have no intention of paying this month. Everyone is in the same boat. The whole country is on hold.'</p> <p>They are waiting to see, for example, what the effect will be of a loan freshly agreed with the IMF, whether it means that the country's bare coffers will now be further replenished with money from the Russians or, as many wish (given the widespread fears that a big Russian investment might undermine Iceland's sovereign identity), from their cousins in Scandinavia. Only once a loan package is on the table will it be possible for the government to try to come up with some sort of rescue plan. 'Yet there is another thing I prefer almost not to think about,' says Bergsson, who insists that he is staying calm, though his eyes betray an air of anguish bordering on physical pain. 'Our home, in which we had invested so many dreams and so much money, is losing value with every day that passes.'</p> <p>Bergsson recognises, all the same, that there are many people worse off than he is. Among them, the thousand or so young bank employees - in many cases the cream of the Icelandic education system, people with Masters degrees and doctorates from foreign universities - who have been fired in the past month, and who had bet on the good life with more rash credit-taking exuberance than he had done. 'But those that make me the saddest, because after all </p> <p>I still have time to reconstruct my life, are the old people who have lost their savings.'</p> <p>It has been a surprise to discover how reluctant Icelanders are (Bergsson is a rare exception) to talk about the dramas they are enduring. This is shown in the fact that when I was there, two weeks into the full-blown crisis, the Icelandic newspapers hadn't published any stories about the ordinary victims of the crash - at least, none mentioning any names. It was as if the journalists understood that Icelanders were too ashamed to look at themselves in the mirror. That was why the majority of case histories that I heard were second-hand.</p> <p>Such as the one - again, entirely typical - of the father-in-law of a writer who retired on the Friday before the Monday on which his bank, Glitnir, had to be nationalised. 'He is 70 years old. He was an executive of a hydroelectric power company,' said the writer, who asked not to be named. 'Early this year the bank convinced him - as they had done many others of his age and circumstances - to transfer his life savings from a solid account that yielded interest of 14 per cent to one that yielded 20. They assured him that the move was riskier in theory, but not so in practice. The solidity of the world banking system was his guarantee, they told him. So he transferred the funds and, within barely 48 hours of his retirement, he saw how the money he had saved with a view to enjoying the last years of his life had gone forever.'</p> <p>The writer, who has three small children, enjoys the good fortune of having almost paid off his mortgage. Yet he does not consider himself to be safe. On the one hand, his wife risks losing her job in an organisation which depends for its existence on the sponsorship of an Icelandic bank. On the other hand, because of the worrying economic prospects his publishers have told him they cannot afford to print three books he has written, and that they had commissioned. What is more, there are signs that the biggest book-selling chain in Iceland could go under, which could have a catastrophic effect on the biggest publisher. 'And all this,' the writer says, 'in a country where, until now, individuals have been buying more books than anywhere else!'</p> <p>As for Iceland's musical tradition, the country suffered another blow to morale when it was announced two weeks ago that a planned tour of Japan by the Icelandic Symphony Orchestra had been cancelled. The organisers wrote to say that, given the crisis, it would be best if they did not come.</p> <p>One way out for musicians and others able to compete internationally is to emigrate. And this is precisely the biggest fear of the dozen or so people I talked to for this article. 'If we are going to get out of this mess, if we are going to rebuild the country on a solid and enduring base, if we are going to take the essential step of diversifying our economy, what we must not see is a brain drain,' says Svafa Gronfeldt, rector of the University of Reykjavik. 'We are a survivor nation, by definition. To have managed to create a good life here has been the result of a tremendous imagination and great practical resourcefulness. Our great advantage today is that we have a lot of highly trained young people able to function in the global market. We must retain them.'</p> <p>Thorir Bergsson is not a typical case in the sense that he is a chef (though one of the many symptoms of the Icelandic success story has been an abundance of excellent restaurants in the capital), but he does reflect the attitude of many others who share his option of finding employment abroad. 'We don't want to go, even though my wife and I both know that we could get jobs elsewhere,' he says. 'But it would be terrible if people of my generation were to abandon ship now. Although, of course, if the welfare of our children is at risk, our idealism won't last for ever.'</p> <p>Dagur Eggertsson, ex-mayor of Reykjavik and a doctor by training, says that the trauma the country is undergoing intensifies, especially in the case of the older people who have lost their savings, at the prospect of the best and the brightest leaving. </p> <p>'It's not only that it would cost us so much more to build up the economy again,' says Eggertsson<strong>, '</strong>it's that this is a country in which families are very united - maybe more united than ever right now - and the pain of separation would be terrible. I know a man who works for the government whose three children - two of them bankers, one a telecoms executive -have all just lost their jobs. He sees it as virtually inevitable that the three will go abroad.'</p> <p>Yet Eggertsson shares the opinion of Svafa Gronfeldt that Iceland could end up giving the world a lesson in how to emerge out of this great crisis. 'We must reflect on the humiliation we have endured, abandon those mythical old Viking values - after all, most people just stayed at home and worked - and replace them with something new,' he says.</p> <p>Such as what? Gronfeldt, and another half dozen women I interviewed, think they have the answer: 'Feminine values.' </p> <p>Iceland is the country with the highest percentage of women in full-time employment in the world, but, as Gronfeldt points out, almost all of them have remained stuck in the second or third tiers of management. 'The fact is, however, that women in this country are ready, able and willing and this crisis will accelerate their rise to the next step.'</p> <p>This has already started to happen, and in dramatic fashion. The new chief executives of the two big banks that have just been nationalised, Glitnir and Landsbanki, are both women, a development which one male minister described as an attempt to instil 'a new culture' in the banking world. The Financial Times headline on the story was: 'Icelandic women to clean up \"male mess\"'.</p> <p>'Yes,' says Halla Tomasdottir, 'but this time, after cleaning up, we're going to stay.' Tomasdottir has emerged as something of a spokeswoman for an energetic new current in favour of women occupying key leadership posts in the new Iceland that, it is hoped, will emerge from the ruins of the old. 'Before we only rowed; now we're going to decide where the boat is headed.'</p> <p>Tomasdottir has the attributes of a great captain. And today more than ever. She is the president of Audur Capital, a financial services consultancy whose clients are the only ones in Iceland not only to have not lost money in recent months, but to have made some. 'The last four years I'd been watching, incredulous, the screaming gap between the reigning model of investment and what ought to have been the sensible reality. Everything short-term, without taking into account the social consequences; betting on huge profits without seriously evaluating the risks; a shocking excess in the bonus payments to executives; and, shaping everything, a classically masculine way of doing things.'</p> <p>Women in Iceland, as elsewhere, are generally more practical than men, they have their feet more squarely on the ground and they study the consequences of the risks they take with greater diligence, says Tomasdottir, who on the week I was in Reykjavik gave a speech on the subject that was received with almost evangelical excitement by the 100 influential women present. Among them was Oddny Sturludottir, a Reykjavik city councillor, who emerged from the meeting eyes blazing. </p> <p>'We are all furious in Iceland but women especially so,' she said. 'We trusted the men at the helm and now we feel fooled, and totally convinced that if it had been women in charge we wouldn't be owing all these billions right now. They talk about the Viking model! What is the Viking model? Rapists and robbers! That's no model for the 21st century.'</p> <p>Which does not mean, as far as Tomasdottir is concerned, that it is the end of the capitalist model. 'Not at all. It's the beginning of a new improved capitalism, one that is led not by women alone - of course not - but one that is guided by a more feminine concept of life.' That consists, she explains, 'in thinking more long term, in working more as a team, and in taking into account not only the immediate profits of investors but also wider values such as the welfare of society as a whole'.</p> <p>Tomasdottir, a fashionably dressed woman of manifest dynamism and extravagant good humour, says she is excited by the challenges ahead. 'We will surprise the world!' she declares. 'We shall emerge stronger from all this and the world will imitate our example. You'll see!'</p> <p>But before then - and even she does not deny this - three or four tough years will have to elapse. There will be significant unemployment for the first time since the Icelandic economy's first stirrings at the end of the second world war; the currency will go down before it goes up; some of the country's finest brains will depart and many elderly people will forever lament the opportunity lost to enjoy their long-awaited retirement. </p> <p>'The party's over,' said the writer whose books the publishers cannot afford to print. 'I'll tell my children one day about the drunken nights of champagne excess the young bankers used to indulge in, and they'll think I'm making it up.'</p>",
  "<p>The fight against climate change will get an unexpected boost today from oil-rich Gulf states which will pledge to invest some of their petrodollar profits in British green energy projects. </p> <p>The surging oil price over the past year has left parts of the Middle East awash with cash as the rest of the world is squeezed by the credit crunch, making Arab royals some of the few active investors worldwide. The Gulf states have enjoyed a $1.4 trillion windfall from higher oil prices since 2003. </p> <p>Ed Miliband, the Climate Change Secretary, arrived in Saudi Arabia yesterday with Gordon Brown at the start of a tour of the region. He said some of that cash would now 'help our firms reap the rewards from going low carbon and providing green energy to thousands of families' under a so-called 'green Gulf deal' to be announced today. </p> <p>Brown, who is accompanied by a high-level trade delegation seeking Gulf investment, including the CEOs of BP and Shell, was due to hold talks yesterday with the Saudi government on plans to boost the International Monetary Fund's capacity to help distressed economies during the current crisis. Britain wants the Gulf states to release more funds to the IMF, with Saudi Arabia likely to play a key role in talks later this month in Washington. </p> <p>As the government attempted to deal with the financial crisis in the UK, it emerged yesterday that Jim Murphy, the Scottish Secretary, has discussed a rival bid for the troubled HBOS bank, which could provide an alternative to the planned merger with Lloyds TSB. Ministers have been challenged over whether the new 'superbank' is still the right option following the bail-out of British banks.</p> <p>Murphy, who has met Jim Spowart, founder of Intelligent Finance, which is part of HBOS, said yesterday that if there was 'a second serious bid then [the Treasury] would be happy to talk to them.' Spowart, who has previously accused ministers of trying to railroad the merger through, said he had been told by merchant bankers that an unnamed financial services organisation was interested and thought he should 'alert the government' to the possibility. </p> <p>The potential bid risks causing confusion hours after Peter Mandelson announced on Friday that he would rubber-stamp the merger with Lloyds despite a report from the Office of Fair Trading warning that bank customers could get a worse deal as a result. The OFT concluded the merger would remove an aggressive competitor from the market and increased risks that banks across the sector would offer less competitive deals on personal bank accounts: 'The value for money of personal current account propositions is expected to worsen, not only for the merged entity but for the industry as a whole.'</p> <p>The merger also risked 'substantial lessening of competition' for mortgages, with the new merged bank controlling 20-30 per cent of the market. In Scotland, it also predicted a lessening of competition and therefore potentially worse deals for small and medium-sized businesses seeking loans and services such as overdrafts. </p> <p>However, Mandelson, the new Business Secretary, ruled the merger was in the public interest because it would protect the stability of the financial system.</p>",
  "<p>It is now 56 years since Ian Fleming's first James Bond thriller, Casino Royale, was published (Sean Connery was dancing in the chorus of South Pacific at the time) and 46 years since the first Bond movie, Dr No, opened in Piccadilly Circus (six years before the birth of Daniel Craig). Created at the same time as Hugh Hefner's Playboy and exhibiting a similar hedonistic ethos, Bond became first a derided cult, then an approved international hero as President Kennedy's favourite bedtime reading, before developing into a cultural institution and a giant commercial franchise. The five principal actors who've played Bond - Connery, Moore, Dalton, Brosnan and Craig - have in their individual personas reflected the changing times to which the series has cannily adjusted.</p> <p>The Bond business has always been a calculated Anglo-American enterprise (the Hollywood pro Richard Maibaum scripted the first 13 in collaboration with British writers). Fleming's ideal movie would have been directed by Hitchcock and starred Cary Grant. Quantum of Solace, directed by a Hollywood-based German, Marc Forster, has an original screenplay by Hollywood's Paul Haggis (Canadian-born, like the first co-producer of the Bond movies, Harry Saltzman), and two Englishmen, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, and presents itself as a sequel to Casino Royale, adapted and updated from Fleming's first novel. You may recall (the producers expect you to) that Craig's Bond ended up having the supposed love of his life killed. He's now out to avenge her death at the hands of a ruthless, amorphous international organisation (clearly a reflection of the 'war on terror') of which MI6 and the CIA know little. </p> <p>The title of the film comes from a curious Maughamesque tale told by the Governor of the Bahamas to Bond and published in the 1960 collection For Your Eyes Only. The story is about the breakdown of a colonial official's marriage in post-war Bermuda and, by his self-proclaimed 'Law of the Quantum of Solace', the governor means that which is left by way of love and friendship when all else has gone from a relationship. Bond listens and learns, and what is interesting is that his recently completed assignment in the Caribbean (the time is 1957-58) has been to destroy boats smuggling arms to Castro's guerrillas: 'If anything, his sympathies were with the rebels, but the government had a big export programme with Cuba.' So he must reluctantly go along with national policy. </p> <p>Bond is in a similar position in the new picture. In past films he's often been insubordinate, doing things his own way, but in Quantum of Solace he finds himself for the first time at odds with the CIA and MI6. He has identified as the enemy the wily, plutocratic Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) who, it transpires, is assembling a cartel of international business magnates to control the world's water supply, an echo on a global scale of Chinatown. But the British and American governments want Greene on their side, and the Foreign Secretary, no less, tells M (Judi Dench in her sixth appearance as Bond's boss) that if she doesn't pull Bond out of the field 'the Americans will put him down'.</p> <p>All this takes us into the realpolitik of le Carr\u00e9, a place of self-interest where no one is to be trusted, though perhaps the conspiratorial world of Jason Bourne is closer to the mark. The director, his cinematographer, editor and writers have set out to outdo the Bourne trilogy, and the picture sacrifices everything to maintaining a breakneck speed. The camera moves with dizzying rapidity, the cutting is frantic. Almost the only brief period of repose comes during the opening credits, which are rendered in that dreamy erotic style developed for the 007 pictures by Maurice Binder (silhouettes of naked women interwoven with undulating sand dunes) and accompanied by the worst song ever composed for a Bond flick. </p> <p>These credits appear after a violent, bone-crushing pre-credit car chase from the Italian coast to Siena and are followed by a brief torture scene and a destructive chase around the town cross-cut with the Palio. With little scene setting the action shifts to Haiti, Austria, Italy again and finally Bolivia. There are pursuits by car, boat and plane (Bond handles a Douglas DC3 transport plane with dexterity), lethal fights and climactic pyrotechnics at an elegant hotel in the Atacama desert. There is no coherence, humour, affection, reflection. Bond is accompanied by a Bolivian beauty (Olga Kurylenko), also on a revenge trip, but little is made of their relationship, and the suggestive parallels between her pursuit of a vicious general and the murder of Scarpia in a production of Tosca that Bond attends in Austria are buried in the general confusion. </p> <p>An MI6 girl, naked beneath her raincoat, meets Bond at La Paz airport and spends the night with him (though we don't see them having sex) merely so she can finish up like Shirley Eaton in Goldfinger, with crude oil standing in for gold. The nearest to an erotic moment comes when a continuously petulant M takes a phone call from a distant Bond while running her night-time bath and applying cleansing cream. </p> <p>After two feeble quips early on, Bond gives up on comedy and has neither time nor occasion to smile. What he does do is get bruised, cut, and above all he runs - up stairs, down streets, across roof-tops - as fast as Kelly Holmes and as far as Paula Radcliffe. It's a heavy-hearted film for a weary time. During a little coda in Russia it takes a deep breath and attempts a serious conclusion but merely ends up being solemn.</p>",
  "<p>Dianne Thompson, chief executive of National Lottery operator Camelot, will be unveiled as non-executive chair of radio industry body RadioCentre this week. Her appointment is a coup for the organisation, which represents Britain's biggest commercial operators, including Heart owner Global Radio and Magic FM, owned by German group Bauer Media, as well as the radio stations of Guardian Media Group, owner of The Observer</p> <p>Thompson, one of the country's most highly regarded executives, joins the industry as it faces an advertising downturn and tries to convince consumers that digital radio, which uses new technology to enable more stations with better sound quality to take to the air, can reinvigorate the medium. Plans for a digital network suffered a setback recently, when Channel 4 abandoned a scheme to lead a consortium of new stations. </p> <p>Thompson, who will take up the post in February, replaces Paul Brown, an industry veteran who has worked in commercial radio for 30 years.

  "<p>To his fans Lewis Hamilton is potentially the most exciting driver ever to race in Formula 1, the daredevil embodiment of its speed, daring and glamour. To his critics, though, he is a cocksure young pretender whose buccaneering style at over 200mph as he chases world championship glory could cost lives.</p> <p>The trouble for Hamilton is that his detractors include many of his rivals on the track and some of the biggest names in the sport's hierarchy. During a controversy-strewn season, which ends tonight in Brazil with McLaren driver Hamilton starting on the grid in only fourth position and his great rival, hometown boy Felipe Massa on pole, the 23-year-old has found himself condemned as arrogant, dangerous, a naive youth and, oddly, 'a Martian'. </p> <p>But in an interview with Observer Sport Hamilton has scorned his unpopularity among his peers as a price worth paying for his single-minded determination to become motorsport's undisputed king - a status which could see him overtaking David Beckham as Britain's highest-earning sports star. </p> <p>The Hertfordshire-born driver is seven points clear of Ferrari's Massa and needs to only finish in the top five at the Interlagos circuit to become F1's youngest ever world champion, the first black man to win the title and the first Briton to clinch victory since Damon Hill in 1996. Victory in Brazil could propel Hamilton into the stratosphere of world sporting stars and see his income rocket, experts predict. </p> <p>Brought up in a council house on the Shephall estate in Stevenage, he is now paid \u00a315m-a-year by McLaren Mercedes and an estimated \u00a33m by sportswear giant Reebok. That is less than the \u00a324m per year the former England captain is believed to earn from playing football and personal sponsorship deals. But while Beckham is nearing retirement, Hamilton is still in only his second season in the blue-chip sport of F1 and has come nowhere near yet realising his commercial potential. </p> <p>'Lewis is already both a sporting phenomenon and a commercial phenomenon and has so much potential to get so much bigger. He's dynamic, represents excellence, flair and charisma and, crucially, he's cool, young and an achiever, not a celebrity for celebrity's sake', said Sean Jefferson, chief executive of sports sponsorship agency Mindshare Performance. </p> <p>Asked about the animosity he inspires in some other drivers, Hamilton replied: 'I'm not particularly bothered because I've got some really good friends here, and I've got some really good friends in my life. We're competitors; we're not here to play in the paddock. I don't want to be hated. If I was here to try and make friendships then of course it would seem tough. But that's not the case.' </p> <p>Hamilton acknowledged the differences between him and his rivals which help explain the simmering tensions which have overshadowed the season. 'I don't socialise with the other drivers. I'm not a member of the GPDA (Grand Prix Drivers' Association). I don't hang around and play poker, so they don't really know me to comment on me. I don't particularly think they don't like me; it's just that they don't know me well enough,' he said. </p> <p>Hamilton also admitted that he had made 'too many mistakes' during the 17 races so far. He singled out his decision-making at last month's Japanese GP as a serious error of judgment. He braked too late in trying to regain the lead at the first corner, after a poor start from pole, and finished 12th. Without that he may already have been crowned champion. </p> <p>Hamilton also reopened another of the season's bitterest rows by suggesting that F1 stewards are biased against his McLaren team, which is based near Woking in Surrey, and in favour of Ferrari. Referring to the 25-second penalty imposed on him for his driving during the Belgian GP, he said: 'The stewards make the decisions and you have to deal with it. They're harsh on everyone. It does seem at times, though, that they've been a bit more harsh on us.' </p> <p>If he wins tonight, there is no limit to how much he could earn. 'Lewis isn't a high-end global superstar yet, but he's getting close. He is one of Britain's biggest superstars and is arguably F1's biggest star but he could become so much bigger commercially,' said Jefferson. Hamilton's global profile has forced McLaren Mercedes to set aside their usual rule that their drivers cannot promote companies apart from the team's corporate sponsors. </p> <p>Another sponsorship expert, Tim Crow of Synergy, said: 'Lewis Hamilton is pretty much a brand's dream. He's a winner, he's young, he's a skilled media operator, he's handsome and he comes across as being very professional. Plus he's in a sport where many of the people who watch it on television are the sort that brands want to target: young and affluent men in their 30s and 40s. He's going to earn tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of pounds,' said Crow, who works with big companies such as Coca-Cola and RBS.</p> <p>A Hamilton triumph tonight will leave a Peterborough man \u00a3125,000 the richer. Convinced of Hamilton's talent after watching him race karts against his son, in 1998 the man bet \u00a3100 on him winning the F1 world championship before his 25th birthday at odds of 500-1 and \u00a350 on him doing that and winning an F1 race before he turned 23.</p>",
  "<p>The famous mutton chops may have gone but, at 61, Emerson Fittipaldi is still every bit the racer, right down to the heavy gold band with inlaid chequered flag that he slips on to a finger of his right hand every morning - his Indianapolis 500 winner's ring. He was Brazil's first Formula One world champion aged 25, which at the time made him the youngest title winner. Whether it is Felipe Massa or Lewis Hamilton who triumphs at Interlagos today, each could trace their racing lineage back to this man.</p> <p>On the day after Goodwood's famed Revival meeting and despite being one of motor sport's superstars, he is as excited as a toddler to have met his heroes at the Sussex circuit. Unlike other greats, however, he is neither fat in the face nor shaky of hand. True, his voice is quiet and his answers sometimes take a little while to prepare, but it is well over three decades since he won his two world titles, the first in 1972 with Lotus and then two years later with McLaren.</p> <p>Fittipaldi's conversation is constantly punctuated by 'I'm very excited', 'I love racing' and 'I'm so happy'. He does not stop talking about driving - racing a Corvette at Goodwood, driving the pace car at this year's Indy 500, his impatience to test the new Ferrari-powered A1GP machine - and answers spear off on a tangent as his passion for his sport takes over the question. Massa may be the outsider for the title, but it seems Brazil has a score to settle with Britain when it comes to the F1 drivers' championship.</p> <p>'Formula One started to be popular there in the Seventies when I joined grand prix racing, and then with Nelson [Piquet] and Ayrton [Senna] we brought eight world championships,' he says. 'Britain won 12, so we are four behind. Germany won seven with one guy. Brazil is second most successful; Britain has a lot.'</p> <p>While Massa has undoubtedly suffered from bad luck, he also put in some duff performances earlier in the season. So, if his fellow countryman wins the world championship this year... 'It would be great for Brazil,' Fittipaldi interjects quickly. But would he be a worthy champion? 'I think anybody who wins the world championship deserves it. They have to have ability, have to have talent, have to have all the circumstances behind them. The championship year is always a special one. If you look at the record book for Formula One, I would say 99 per cent of the world champions deserved it. Felipe is doing a very good year, he's been faster than Kimi [Raikkonen] most of the year. It is an incredible championship.'</p> <p>Only 99 per cent of champions? So which one per cent should not have won? 'I don't want to be a radical,' he says before a long pause and the excuse that he cannot remember all the championships. 'If you see it the other way, should Stirling Moss have been champion? Yes, but he never won. He deserved to be the world champion. Ronnie Peterson should have been; he was my team-mate - an incredible, fast driver.'</p> <p>National pride is spurring Fittipaldi into willing Massa to win, but he is somewhat in awe of Lewis Hamilton's achievements, too. 'Nobody ever do what he do in two seasons in grand prix racing,' he says, after recalling first watching him race in a Formula Three event in Germany. And Fittipaldi is one of those who disagreed with the Belgian Grand Prix stewards' decision to strip the McLaren driver of his victory at Spa - a key point in the season, which gifted Massa a win. 'In my opinion he got Kimi by surprise. I think Kimi was emotionally affected by the first manoeuvre and then he lost out on the second. He [Hamilton] was correct to overtake the way he overtook, because he already gave away a place.'</p> <p>Hamilton has come under attack from rivals over his aggressive style, with the atmosphere becoming, at times, unfriendly. Whether it is less successful drivers with sour grapes, former champions airing their grievances or simply the monotonous sound of corporate-speak, it's easy to believe there was a better class of hero back in the day - as you can guess from the genuine sadness felt at the recent death of Ferrari's 1961 world champion, Phil Hill.</p> <p>'I was talking to Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks this weekend,' Fittipaldi says. 'They were my idols and I followed their races in magazines - I had no TV. Because of the high-risk factor there used to be much more camaraderie outside of the track. Many guys got killed back then. There was a lot of respect between drivers. Now it's different, but you cannot blame the drivers now, because they never knew a different environment. They are growing up in a new environment of grand prix racing. We cannot judge them because we come from a different background. When Phil Hill passed away I was in America and all the race community were very sad. When I see Stirling Moss, you know, he's my hero, I want to help him.'</p> <p>If there's one thing Fittipaldi would like today's drivers to do it is to race cars that make them work hard - such as the new A1GP car. In addition to running his fruit farms back home and driving whatever racing cars he can climb into, Fittipaldi manages Team Brazil in a series that he describes as having the same feel as Formula One in the 1970s. 'It's funny to say, but the A1GP car is like simply the best grand prix car today,' he says. 'Same power in the engine, no electronics, the driver has to do all the driving and show his courage. It's a very tough car to drive, very fast and at the same time very sophisticated. Grand prix racing always will be grand prix racing, but for the future grand prix car they should look at the A1 car.'</p> <p>Fittipaldi will be watching the Brazilian Grand Prix this afternoon, relishing the excitement as much as he did when following the exploits of Brooks and Moss through the pages of magazines when he was a child - and probably wishing he could be out there racing, too.</p> <p>\u2022 The next round of the A1GP championship is on Sunday in China</p>",
  "<p>Europe's richest man, Rinat Akhmetov, has turned down the opportunity to buy Portsmouth. An intermediary acting for the club last month approached representatives of System Capital Management, the holding company that controls Akhmetov's other businesses, with a prospectus, but was rebuffed immediately.</p> <p>Akhmetov, who made his fortune in mining and metallurgical concerns, has been the president of the Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk since 1996. Portsmouth owner Alexandre Gaydamak, who has also been in talks with the South African consortium that has been linked to Fulham and Charlton, is believed to be looking for \u00a340m for the club, which is understood to have debts totalling \u00a350m.</p> <p>Portsmouth last week received \u00a35m in compensation from Tottenham for manager Harry Redknapp, who confirmed that the club's finances were 'a little bit tight'. However, executive chairman Peter Storrie has repeatedly dismissed reports of a financial crisis.</p> <p>'We've said all we're going to say about finances,' he said last week. 'It's getting boring now. It's a boring, boring subject. The club is fine, move on. The owner continues to put money into the club.'</p> <p>Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown has revealed he will meet new manager Tony Adams this week to discuss joining Portsmouth's coaching staff. 'If I can help in any way it's something I am prepared to look at,' he said.

The Scottish FA, though, have elected not to use Novo after being made aware of a long-standing agreement between England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales that only players who were born in or have a parent or grandparent from a home nation should be allowed to represent it.</p> <p>SFA chief executive Gordon Smith said: 'We have had discussions with the other associations in the past couple of days and I've found out that everyone is adhering to our agreement and that, subsequently, we're all going down the line that will be blood line at the moment.'</p> <p>Ruud Gullit has questioned if David Beckham will 'get a game at all' for Milan<strong> </strong>when he moves on loan to the Italian club in the January transfer window from LA Galaxy, and also claimed the former England captain's global media profile could affect the team's performance, writes Jamie Jackson. The 33-year-old is returning to the European game in an attempt to secure the regular football he believes will keep him in the plans of England head coach Fabio Capello.</p> <p>Gullit led the supremely successful Milan side coached by Capello during the late 1980s and early 1990s and was Beckham's head coach at LA Galaxy during an unsuccessful 13-month spell that ended in August. Now working as an ambassador for the Ford Feel Football programme, he said: 'Beckham has to get used to a different kind of football, a different kind of system - so I'm curious to see if he gets a game at all.'</p> <p><strong>West Ham </strong>will continue with the director of football model despite its latest failure at Spurs that last week resulted in manager Juande Ramos being sacked and the role being discarded with the departure of Damien Comolli.

  "<p>Amid the gravest financial crisis since the Thirties, a looming civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo and further evidence of runaway climate change, Gordon Brown and David Cameron last week made time to comment on some lewd answerphone messages left by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross. Their dubious sense of urgency was only outdone by the Justice Minister, Jack Straw, who instead of dealing with overcrowded prisons and on-the-run jihadis, demanded the sacking of the Light Entertainment Two. In the process, the three sealed the fate of one of the more creative forces within the BBC, Radio 2 controller Lesley Douglas, who honourably resigned.</p> <p>Clearly, the politicians could not help themselves. After all those years of irksome Newsnight interviews, here was a chance to give the Corporation a good kicking: why wasn't the BBC doorstepping its own executives? asked Straw. But they should all have taken a deep breath and resisted the temptation. In putting the boot into the BBC, they were helping to grind down one of Britain's last great public institutions. With the Church of England in perennial crisis, the City a byword for greed and malfeasance, our universities overwhelmed and underfunded and Westminster dogged by decades of sleaze, the BBC has come to stand for an idea of Britain far more potent than any party political project. </p> <p>Of course, the behaviour of Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand is not the territory upon which one would ideally choose to defend the BBC. Despite the fact that only two listeners originally complained and that, rather like the Danish cartoon controversy, the frenzy was whipped up after the event by a TV agent and tabloid journalist, the messages left on Andrew Sachs's answer machine were boorish, crass and ugly. Deciding then to broadcast them on Radio 2 was an act of remarkable editorial stupidity. But the failings of a single programme are surely not cause for another epic BBC crisis of confidence. </p> <p>Part of the problem is that the BBC is its own worst enemy. The institution's angst-ridden, liberal mindset means that it enjoys nothing more than ritual and very public acts of self-abasement. The Today programme's John Humphrys was slavering with excitement as he piled into his paymasters, while Sir Michael Lyons, chair of the BBC Trust, decided not to offer any decent defence of his organisation. The news teams in particular have it in for Ross, with Radio 2's Jeremy Vine helpfully explaining how 'difficult' it would be for him to rejoin the station. </p> <p>In the wake of the Hutton report, the wrongly edited sequence that suggested the Queen had stormed out of a photoshoot and even the Blue Peter phone-in 'scandal' (over the naming of a cat!), the BBC has developed a worrisome fetish for institutional self-immolation: the director-general rushing back from holiday as if war had broken out, hastily concocted internal inquiries, executive purges and another round of public apologies. </p> <p>For such a powerful, often arrogant actor in the global media marketplace, the BBC's senior executives have a remarkably fragile sense of their own corporate prowess. Indeed, it was that very weakness that first allowed Jonathan Ross's agents to walk all over them with an \u00a318m contract demand. Why didn't the BBC realise its own worth and just say no? </p> <p>In the middle of this media firestorm, which has been so much easier and more enjoyable for other journalists to report on than hedge funds and Pakistani politics, the rest of the organisation got on with the job: reporting on the clashes in the Democratic Republic of Congo; broadcasting the World Service into countries and regions devoid of free media; making award-winning history and science documentaries, drama series and globally successful formats; finding new talent; providing sophisticated, advert-free programming that one can only really appreciate abroad when faced with the terrible reality of American and Italian TV or the soporific self-importance of German and French programming. </p> <p>More than that, the BBC continues in its curious dual role of independent broadcaster and curator of the nation's identity. Take this month's First World War commemorations. Intriguingly run out of the religion unit (hinting at the national, civic religion of remembrance in our secular age), it is the multi-platform weight of the BBC behind the event that nurtures and supports this annual act of togetherness. The quality and quantity of its TV and radio programmes marking the 90th anniversary of the Armistice, the internet opportunities provided for further research and the deployment of its remarkable archive are all designed to encourage cross-generational conversations and a broader appreciation of sacrifice and patriotism. The BBC is the vehicle through which we tell stories about ourselves to ourselves and 11 November provides one of the few moments when the nation still comes together. It does so through the Royal Legion working hand in glove with the Corporation. </p> <p>This dual function of programme maker and cultural curator has been the BBC's strength and weakness since the television broadcast of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. As regional and civic affiliations across the UK began to subside in the postwar years, it was the BBC that started to craft a dominant national and imperial narrative. To begin with, it was certainly southern, upper-middle class and 'hideously white' but over time the BBC progressively reflected the nation's make-up. Ironically, it was this ambition to continue to cater for the nation at large that has landed the Corporation with this week's meltdown. With a new generation that takes its radio off the internet, receives its news from YouTube and communicates not through must-see TV but Facebook and Bebo, the challenge is maintaining engagement with this national asset. The answer was BBC3, Radio 1Xtra, the iPlayer and, tragically, Russell Brand. And, however misguided the Brand-Ross jokes were, what is striking is the generational difference in attitudes towards the furore.</p> <p>The worst of all worlds would be now for the BBC to respond to this crisis with more executive breast-beating and indecision. There is much wrong with the BBC: it remains overmanned and bureaucratic; it is increasingly liable to appeal to the lowest common denominator rather than the more intelligent sensibility; it has given in too readily to the cult of celebrity. But now we have to add to that a looming sense of frailty about its own editorial rigour and political impartiality. In the face of every passing government and newspaper attack, the top brass now appear far too ready to run up the white flag. As former BBC grandee Liz Forgan put it on Friday, the BBC increasingly looks like it has 'lost its wits'. </p> <p>In fact, the BBC should get back on the front foot and re-find that inner confidence about its mission. It needs to realise that its place in modern Britain frequently transcends the blustering editorials and aggrieved backbenchers: it is a progressive, internationalist, global brand telling an important story about the nature and purpose of multicultural Britain in the 21st century. Its ability to do so depends on an institutional confidence that is beginning to be unpicked. The BBC is not above criticism. It makes mistakes and should be brought to book. But before the politicians pile into the Corporation, they should realise just what kind of resource they are running down. We have few like it left.</p>",

  "<p>Friday nights without Jonathan Ross will leave a gaping hole in BBC1's weekend schedule, even if it returns after Ross serves his three-month suspension, but it will also deprive celebrities of a valuable vehicle for selling their wares. Ross's show, which regularly attracts 2.5 million viewers, despite being screened at 10.35pm, has become the favoured outlet for stars with a film to publicise or a book to promote, and PRs and agents who had booked their clients on to the programme will be frantically redrawing their media strategies following the BBC's decision to suspend Ross over the Andrew Sachs affair. </p> <p>Should Ross leave the BBC, plenty of broadcasters will be willing to match his reputed \u00a36m a year salary to snap him up, such is his reputation as the UK's chat show king. A flamboyant figure who began as a humble researcher, Ross used his own fame to attract the biggest names to his show, but, in common with other programmes, guests do not always take their place on his sofa for the kudos and commercial upside an appearance can generate. Like rivals on other channels, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross has been known to pay guests, a revelation that may surprise viewers who assume entertainers traipse the talk show circuit because they need the publicity rather than a boost to their bank balance. </p> <p>The show's success means it only pays out as a last resort - its market-leading position means big American stars contractually obliged to publicise the films they star in tend to appear as a matter of routine when they are in London on the European leg of their promotional tour. </p> <p>But the explosion of entertainment programmes that rely on high-profile guests to deliver big ratings has created a market in celebrity appearances, as they vie to attract the biggest names in an intensely competitive field. </p> <p>'It's always been the case,' says a leading celebrity PR, 'that you can get paid for Richard &amp; Judy. You can get paid for anything. If you've got nothing to promote, you can get good money because you're not doing any other show or newspaper interviews. It becomes an exclusive. Rates vary from \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000, and '\u00a340,000 if you're lucky'. </p> <p>Another PR who represents entertainment figures with global appeal says Hollywood stars such as Tom Cruise routinely command as much as \u00a330,000 to appear on chat shows, although the scramble for A-list guests is slightly less frenetic since Michael Parkinson's show disappeared from ITV. Parkinson complained in his recent biography that his show, cancelled by ITV earlier this year, suffered because it could not match the \u00a315,000 fees guests and their agents were negotiating with rival talk shows. </p> <p>Graham Norton, who moved from Channel 4 to BBC2 after the corporation secured his services in another multi-million-pound deal, also imported a practice of paying some big stars to appear on the programme, according to industry insiders. Goldie Hawn, a recent guest, is thought to have been paid tens of thousands of pounds, and other US stars without a film to promote are also often paid. </p> <p>'Guest budgets vary in size, and are used differently by production companies,' says one industry source. 'Some shows might not pay anything for six months and then blow it all on a few big stars at the end of the series.' Even Top Gear, BBC2's flagship car programme, has been known to pay guests to appear, according to leading PR advisers. </p> <p>The amount depends on the fame of the guest and their news value. Public figures who have questions to answer but nothing to promote can command a premium, not least because the rules of engagement are different when money changes hands. They can expect a rough ride at the hand of their interlocutors, and, without a product to plug, the conversation is more likely to turn to controversial topics they might not otherwise agree to discuss. Norton, in particular, is treated warily by many showbiz agents because his appeal depends in part on poking fun at his guests, and his unpredictable approach sometimes seems calculated to cause maximum discomfort. </p> <p>'A publicist would be much more reticent to put their client in that sort of environment,' says an insider who has worked on several of Britain's biggest chat shows. Often a substantial fee is the only incentive that will persuade them to submit to the ordeal. </p> <p>Commercial broadcasters who screen This Morning and Paul O'Grady's C4 show are free to pay whatever it takes in the open market for guests, though many are not superstars and are happy to appear free of charge. </p> <p>Using licence fee money to hire guests would be more controversial, but crucially the BBC does not make chat shows in-house. Ross and Norton's programmes are made by the entertainers' own production companies, which means that appearance fees, when they are paid, do not come directly from the BBC's coffers. </p> <p>Ross's show, recorded on Thursday but broadcast late on Friday, can deliver a huge sales boost as viewers head to the shops the morning after it is aired, and its role as a promotional tool means it doesn't have to pay out as often as its rivals. 'A lot of PRs will be staring into their coffee this week,' says a senior industry figure representing several household names.</p> <p>Many will be desperately trying to shoehorn clients on to shows they previously refused to deal with. The irony is that Ross could command a huge fee himself were he to appear on a rival chat show to discuss the events of last week.</p>",
  "<p>John Clough smiles wryly at the news that the number of fuel-poor has just increased by a third to 3.5 million. As chief executive of Eaga, a green services company whose job is to help people out of fuel poverty, he can't ignore the prospect of a few hundred thousand more homes to insulate and heat. As the son of a Northumberland miner who can remember huddling around a coal fire to keep warm, he shivers at the thought. </p> <p>Newcastle-based Eaga - originally the Energy Action Grants Agency - is a company for which the time ought to have come; and the same might go for the forthright, charismatic Clough, its driving force. The inspired offspring of the public sector, Eaga is now a publicly quoted company co-owned by employees, 'selling' low carbon and social inclusion - 'public-sector values delivered in a very effective way', as Clough puts it. </p> <p>The company could be a poster-child for post-crunch capitalism, the embodiment of Peter Drucker's definition of the socially responsible business, turning 'a social problem into economic opportunity and economic benefit, into productive capacity, into human competence, into well-paid jobs, and into wealth'. </p> <p>For this, thank a series of bold, entrepreneurial and fortuitous decisions. Eaga came into being in 1990 to manage a \u00a325m contract to insulate and draught-proof poorly built homes under the government's Heating and Energy Efficiency Scheme. Clough was employee number 1, of five. The luck (or genius) was for Whitehall to establish the organisation as a company limited by guarantee, rather than as an agency, which allowed for a relatively easy transition to the employee-owned business - modelled on John Lewis - which it became in 2000, with 150 on the payroll.</p> <p>From then on, things speeded up. As Clough intuited, the partnership ethos was a good match for the daily job of improving the homes and living conditions of the less well-off. A clean sweep of the government's Warm Front residential energy efficiency contracts in 2005 was the cue for Eaga to stop just managing programmes and start delivering services itself. Since then, it has built its own insulation and heating companies - what it proudly calls its 'national blue-collar delivery capability' - both organically and through acquisition. </p> <p>By 2007, though, the company's ambitions were running ahead of its means. Clough and his colleagues could see other and much bigger issues looming.The move to a low-carbon, inclusive society, he predicts, will throw up a whole range of environmental issues to solve: not just energy efficiency, but access to technology and, in the future, water as well. 'In a 50-year time frame, the needs - and opportunities - are enormous.'</p> <p>As early proof, Eaga has picked up a \u00a3200m contract to deliver Scottish Power's commitments to reduce overall carbon emissions, and will earn \u00a3500m from the BBC to carry out the digital switchover. Building on its work on fuel poverty, it has developed a one-stop benefits advisory service which has enabled a third of enquirers to claim, on average, an extra \u00a31,500 a year. It is now busily expanding into the social housing sector.</p> <p>To get into these markets, Eaga needed to take a risk on the balance sheet. The partnership trustees had been signalling for more than a year that this kind of expansion would be impossible without access to the capital markets, says Clough. So after some heart-searching - and scrutiny of eight different options - Eaga went public in June 2007 in an IPO that valued the company at about \u00a3450m and handed each partner a payout of around \u00a3100,000. With the Eaga Partnership Trust holding 37 per cent of the shares, and individual partners a further 11 or 12 per cent, the co-ownership ethos is secured, believes Clough, while others can invest in it too. </p> <p>In fact, even in today's chilly financial climate, the tighter constraint on Eaga's growth may not be capital but people. 'In the established parts of the company, the level of engagement that co-ownership gives is palpable,' Clough says; and maintaining and strengthening it is primordial. Eaga pays a lot of attention to recruitment and induction, and works hard to convince those acquired (there are now 4,500 partners in all) of the virtues of an open, respect-driven management style. And if it can't? 'Rome fell because it ran out of Romans,' notes Clough. 'The hardest thing is to part with effective people who make the numbers but don't share the ethos. But it's stick or twist and if they stick, these are the values we ask them to live by.'</p> <p>As everyone acknowledges, that takes work - including on outside shareholders, who at the moment don't much care about partnership, just whether Eaga meets its numbers. If the credit crunch teaches anything, however, it's that the numbers are only as reliable as the manner in which they are made. Here, too, Eaga may be able to teach the city slickers a thing or two.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Simon.Caulkin@observer.co.uk\">Simon.Caulkin@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Last Monday I was standing near the summit of Mount Etna in Sicily, watching smoke and steam rising out of one of its many craters. By the time I got back into mobile phone coverage, it was clear that another volcano was erupting rather closer to home. </p> <p>After weeks of unending news coverage of the global financial meltdown, the BBC found itself confronting all the elements of a classic tabloid story: two high-profile and sometimes controversial celebrities, a much-loved comedy actor and a prank that should never, ever have happened, let alone have hit the airwaves. </p> <p>The BBC broadcasts tens of thousands of hours of radio and television every year. Much of it is live and all of it relies not just on our editorial guidelines and systems of approval and compliance, but on the good judgment of presenters, producers and editorial leaders. They make the decisions about what is and is not acceptable, and 99.9 per cent of time they get it right. Occasionally, they get it wrong. In this case, they - and therefore the BBC - got it spectacularly wrong.</p> <p>As soon as we knew about the problem, we recognised that fact and made an immediate and full apology to Andrew Sachs, his family and our licence-payers. We wanted to understand what had happened. We wanted to be proportionate and fair to all of the individuals involved. But we knew we had to act promptly and firmly, and I believe we did. As well as a full and unreserved apology, we launched an investigation and put an interim report in front of the BBC Trust. The trust has approved my proposed actions and set some testing requirements of its own, and we immediately set about the task of implementing them.</p> <p>Jonathan Ross has also made a comprehensive and unreserved personal apology to Andrew Sachs and his grand-daughter. I believe that he fully understands the seriousness of what has happened. I have made very clear to him the central importance of the clause in his contract about not bringing the BBC into disrepute. We agree that nothing like this must ever happen again and that tight discipline will be required for the future.</p> <p>In all of this though, it is important to disentangle what happened on The Russell Brand Show with the broader, important but essentially separate debate about the boundaries of taste and creativity in modern comedy and entertainment. </p> <p>You can certainly argue about the whys and wherefores of strong language and the discussion of sex in television and radio programmes on the BBC and on other channels. What made this episode so repugnant to the public was the disgraceful invasion of privacy which the calls to Andrew Sachs's answering machine constituted - something which would have been wholly unacceptable, even if none of it had been broadcast. The fact that it was broadcast, of course, greatly compounds the error and the offence.</p> <p>We should be careful to distinguish this set of issues from the more general debate about taste and decency in comedy. It may well be that some viewers would find the expletive-laden phone rants of Malcolm Tucker, in BBC2's The Thick of It, offensive. We know that millions of others thought they were not just funny, but editorially justified - indeed an important part of the whole creative conception. </p> <p>At the BBC we have always felt that it's important not only to reflect the changing course of public attitudes, but also as a broadcaster funded by a universal licence fee to cater to all audiences. What is acceptable today in mainstream comedy would have shocked many viewers 20 years ago. Attitudes and values don't stand still, but there are absolute boundaries we must never cross. Our job is to strike the right balance in delivering content that feels modern and relevant to a wide range of audiences, some of whom are 18 and others 80. </p> <p>Our role is to identify comedy talent, writers, producers and presenters, and provide an environment and, most important, an editorial framework in which they can deliver programmes for different segments of our audiences. Not a rule-book that ensures that all programmes are risk and creativity free, but a commitment to back real originality and talent in a context of responsibility and common sense. And a commitment to our different audiences to signpost the output and to schedule and position it in ways which help them to find programmes they will value and enjoy, and avoid those that they won't. The watershed is an important part of our contract with parents and will remain so.</p> <p>Comedy at the BBC should mean everything from BBC1's Last of the Summer Wine to Radio 4's The Now Show to BBC3's The Mighty Boosh. That is what serving every household in the country entails.</p> <p>The BBC is one of the world's great broadcasters. Goodness knows, it attracts at least its fair share of criticism, but also well-earned plaudits - for its creativity, the trustworthiness of its journalism, the sheer range and quality of its output.</p> <p>Every day licence-payers can enjoy BBC programmes of real ambition, passion and conviction; programmes that entertain, inspire and challenge and offer valuable insights into our lives and the world around us. That's why it has been so painful for so many of us in the BBC to discover what was done in our name and in the name of entertainment by The Russell Brand Show</p> <p>We will do everything in our power to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again, but we will not over-react. I do not believe the British public wants us to lose our creative nerve or to stop backing the thousands of brilliant programme-makers who touch almost every household in the land each week with content that enriches their lives. We have a difficult balance to strike at the BBC - between different audiences and different values, between creativity and control - but it is in that difficult and delicate balance that the BBC's special brand of public service broadcasting subsists. And we are determined not just to defend it, but to strengthen it.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Thompson is Director-General of the BBC</p>",

  "<p>The trunk show for Tinc - the tiny San Francisco-based fashion label - is New York Fashion Week's most achingly hip, most secretive event. It is held on a sticky day in early September, on the sixth floor of an anonymous warehouse building located 20 blocks down from the big tents and the main action of Bryant Park. Its designer, Savannah Knoop, greets a handful of fashion-week hipsters - the edgiest stylists, the most fashion-forward fashion editors - oh, and me. She rolls out her clothes on two chrome rails, so that we can cop a feel. She encourages us to try her creations on in the loos located halfway down a darkened corridor; she feeds us with farmers'-market brownies and a wine-punch concoction. There is no runway show, no models, no music, no scary clipboard ladies, and no reverence.</p> <p>Tinc is brilliant. Androgynous, sharp, well-structured, well-fitting, cooler than Christmas. I don't care that 'Tinc' means 'throwaway' in Thai; that it's as green, as a company, as it possibly can be; that the pieces are spiritual one-offs, individually numbered and fashioned from unusual fabrics. I don't care that the logo is a visual representation of the soundwaves created whenever anyone says 'I love you'. I just care that it's good. </p> <p>No doubt about it, Savannah Knoop is an excellent designer. But the other thing she is, is an excellent liar. Accomplished, adventurous, and daring. I know this because, for six years, Knoop lived a lie. For six years, Knoop perpetuated one of the biggest literary hoaxes of modern times. </p> <p>The Noughties have been an outstanding time for literary hoaxes. In 2006, James Frey was exposed as inventing parts of A Million Little Pieces, his memoir of a lifetime of drug addiction. This year, it transpired that Love and Consequences, Margaret B Jones's memoir of growing up as a mixed race, drug-running foster child in South Central Los Angeles, was the fabricated work of private-school-educated, all-white Margaret Seltzer. Stephen Glass turned his multiple journalistic hoaxes into a professional identity; his story became the subject of a 2004 film, his 2003 autobiographical account of the hoaxing having done very nicely indeed, thank you. </p> <p>But the best - the most extravagant, most starry, most decadent - literary hoax de nos jours, was committed in the name of JT LeRoy. </p> <p>Jeremiah 'Terminator' LeRoy was the Aids-afflicted, emotionally damaged son of a truck-stop prostitute, who'd spent his teenage years living rough on the streets of San Francisco and turning tricks, who'd had a male-to-female sex change; and who overcame all this, and more, to became a literary wunderkind. In 1999, his first novel - Sarah, the story of a child prostitute, which was presumed to be semi-autobiographical - was published, to critical acclaim; within a year, LeRoy was the darling of a hip, indie celeb crowd. He was friends with Winona Ryder (who claimed she met him before he was published, while he was still living rough, hanging about outside the opera house, 'a real ragamuffin'), with photographer Juergen Teller, with Courtney Love. Madonna sent him Kabbalah readings; he was a confidant of Liv Tyler ('who told him everything'). He made the cover of Vanity Fair - in 2003, the magazine ran a gushing story on him, in which they praised his writing abilities extravagantly ('To literary critics and his fellow writers, JT LeRoy has distinguished himself as a precocious talent able to mine golden prose from his white-trash childhood ...'); drew comparisons with immense cultural icons ('In public, LeRoy maintains a Warhol-like mystique. He wears wigs, female apparel, and oversize sunglasses, and he seldom says a word. And yet he can give better phone than Warren Beatty, drawing powerful women into his world with his raspy, girlish drawl') and wondered whether or not his ever-expanding coteries of adoring female celebrity fans will 'make his career, or break it?' (In March 2005, he also made the cover of the Observer Magazine, which ran a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/06/fiction\">reverent and sincere interview</a> with him.) He was a house-guest of Carrie Fisher. Shirley Manson wrote a song about him; the actor Michael Pitt played an approximation of him in Gus Van Sant's adaptation of his collection of short stories, The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things. Designers clamoured to dress him, magazine editors clamoured to commission him. Asia Argento - the Italian film actress and director - had a relationship with him. For six years, JT LeRoy was the hottest, hippest, brightest, most intriguing literary sensation in the world. </p> <p>Which was great, except - he didn't exist. His books were written by Laura Albert, a fortysomething woman who had been a punk, a phone-sex worker, and a porn author, but had never lived on the streets of San Francisco or worked as a teenage prostitute. Savannah Knoop - Albert's twentysomething sister-in-law - had played JT publicly. Knoop bound her breasts, and wore a preposterous blonde wig and sunglasses, affected a West-Virginian accent; and appeared as JT whenever a physical boy was needed. Knoop gave JT's press conferences, she partied on his behalf, she travelled the world as him, doing readings and signings. She posed as him on photoshoots. She had dinners with the directors and actors who optioned LeRoy novels as films; she hung around on set and advised when these films were being made. She had friendships as JT. She had the love affair with Asia Argento.</p> <p>Everywhere she went, Knoop was accompanied by Albert, who posed as Speedie, JT's 'handler'. This allowed Albert to feed Knoop lines when necessary, and cover for any gaps in 'his' knowledge, any biographical discrepancies. </p> <p>For six years, it worked. People bought into JT, to a greater or lesser degree. They didn't ask too many questions. One journalist who spent time with JT LeRoy and Speedie when they came to London on a promotional tour says simply: 'We knew something was up, just not what, exactly. And it was fun; they were fun.' </p> <p>Then, inevitably, Albert and Knoop were found out. In October 2005, Stephen Beachy, a reporter from New York magazine, published his suspicions that JT LeRoy was the pen name of Laura Albert; shortly after that, Warren St John, a writer on the New York Times, published his suspicions that Knoop played JT's physical alter ego. The whole story emerged pretty quickly after that; Geoffrey Knoop (Knoop's half-brother; Albert's then husband), revealed everything he knew, in an article in the New York Times in February 2006.</p> <p>Two years of fallout ensued. Albert's was visible and intense - she was successfully sued for fraud by the film company who optioned Sarah; she split from Geoffrey Knoop. </p> <p>Savannah Knoop, meanwhile, slipped from public view - effortlessly, because no one really knew what she looked like. She was not legally accountable for the hoax; consensus among those celebrities (and non-celebrities) who had been hoaxed, was that they were less wronged by Knoop than by Albert, who, it was felt, had pulled the strings. </p> <p>But now, Knoop is revisiting the affair. She's written a book, Girl Boy Girl, an account of her six years as JT LeRoy; it's published in the UK next week. Laura Albert is extremely cross about the whole thing. When she heard that Knoop was planning a book, she said: 'I am not in any way connected with this book and it disgusts me. Just because you play a writer doesn't mean you are a writer. I think Savannah is being motivated by money and attention. Now that she's had to go back to being a civilian, this is her way of getting back to it. It's sad and it's sleazy. She's really stepping on my feelings ... I'm not interested in making a career of JT, I'm an artist.'</p> <p>But Knoop's unapologetic about her endeavour, and happy to tell to me all about it.</p> <p>So I meet Knoop at the Tinc trunk show. Knoop's always made clothes on the side - she is that kind of a girl. Since the demise of JT LeRoy, she's developed this dabbling into a serious fashion concern. </p> <p>No one else at the trunk show has ever heard of JT LeRoy. The editors and stylists are completely clueless about Savannah Knoop's brilliant and preposterous back story. Then I meet Mary Ellen Mark, the photographer who shot Knoop as JT LeRoy for Vanity Fair in 2003, and who was the only person to address the issue of JT's gender identity directly at that time. 'I've hung out with many transgendered people over the years,' Mark told JT, after their shoot, 'but I don't feel the residue of a boy with you. JT, you don't feel like a boy to me.'</p> <p>At the Tinc show, Mark embraces Knoop, who introduces her to me. </p> <p>You're the one who knew, I say. </p> <p>'Of course I knew!' Mark tells me. She gestures up and down at Knoop, who is standing feet away from her. 'Look at her! She looks like a girl!'</p> <p>And she does. </p> <p>Knoop and I meet again, the following morning over brunch.</p> <p>'Gosh, this all feels very ... intimate,' she says. </p> <p>Because I know lots about you from reading the book, I say. </p> <p>'Right,' she says. 'And it's not that I ... wouldn't tell you those things after a while; but I wouldn't tell you off the bat.'</p> <p>We start with biographical facts, of which there are many more knocking around for JT LeRoy than for Savannah Knoop. Knoop tells me that she was born in 1981 ('the same year as JT, I think ...') which makes her 27, although she seems older. Her family is extravagantly extended. Her father, John Knoop, is a big deal on the San Francisco film-making scene; her mother, Sharon Hennessey, is an acupuncturist and teacher, writer and film producer. John already had three children when he met Sharon; together, they had a daughter, Hennessey (whose surname is Knoop, you'll be relieved to hear); 10 years later, they had Savannah. Knoop's parents split up when Knoop was five, John Knoop moved out, but maintained a decent relationship with his daughters. Knoop and Hennessey grew up to have close relationships with their half-brothers and sisters. </p> <p>She was, she says, 'a little weird, as a kid. I mean, I got on with other kids, but ...' (Knoop trails off a lot, leaves sentences unfinished, perhaps because she hasn't yet got her thoughts in order; perhaps, because this, too, is an evasive tactic she picked up while playing JT.) She went to an all-girls boarding school, which she really loved ('There was minimal cattiness compared with co-ed'); and she meant to go to college, but somehow didn't. 'I was floating, out of high school. Trying to work out what I wanted to be doing.' Her half-brother Geoff began a relationship with Laura Albert; they had a band called Thistle, they needed a singer, and they recruited Knoop. 'I didn't even want to be a singer. Can I sing? Kind of. Really, I think they were just looking for somebody who was ... younger.'</p> <p>Simultaneously Albert, who had written a smattering of short stories as JT LeRoy, was beginning to gain profile, and had realised that she'd need a physical JT. She began by approaching fey young men on the streets of San Francisco, and attempting to explain to them what it was she was looking for. She graduated on to butch young women. But she couldn't find anyone quite right. 'I was wishing, hoping, that Laura would ask me to do it,' Knoop says. 'In my mind, I thought: OK, you need these two slots to be filled - JT, and a singer for the band - and I'd rather be in that slot, the JT slot.'</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>'I was intrigued by the idea of being someone else. I was obsessed by the whole idea of androgyny.'</p> <p>Because you're bisexual?</p> <p>She laughs. 'Queer. But, yeah...'</p> <p>You've had relationships with women as well as men?</p> <p>'Yes.'</p> <p>Did that help you become a boy?</p> <p>'Probably. It's about inhabiting both.'</p> <p>After trying unsuccessfully to recruit a stranger to play JT LeRoy, Albert saw a photo-booth snap of Knoop, and realised that she would make a good JT. Days later, Knoop bound her breasts for the first time, put on the blond wig and sunglasses as extra disguise, and posed for pictures that would accompany a small magazine interview Albert had already given over the telephone. She was petrified, but the shoot went well. Chris, the photographer ('I've forgotten his surname, and the name of the magazine'), accepted Knoop as JT. The story ran. </p> <p>They had, Knoop says, absolutely no idea what they were getting themselves into.</p> <p>'I think we were both, like: let's try this out. But no. I don't think we had any idea what was going to happen.' </p> <p>Was Knoop perpetually scared she'd be found out?</p> <p>'Yes! Terrified! Though she [Laura Albert] wasn't! She wasn't! I was constantly, so scared all the time. Every time we would do anything. But she always thought we'd be fine. It never crossed her mind.'</p> <p>What did you think would happen if you were discovered?</p> <p>'I don't know. I just knew it would be bad.'</p> <p>It's hard to know exactly how things evolved from that point. Knoop's memory of the next six years is fractured and muddled; even after reading Girl Boy Girl, I'm not a lot clearer on what happened when. It's an excellent yarn, and it's well written (contrary to expectations, Knoop is a natural writer), but it is circuitous, and Knoop is not a rigorous researcher. When she forgets things - names, details, places - she makes something up, and asterixes the relevant section. Which is charming, but not exactly informative.</p> <p>What we do know is that, in the space of 18 months, JT LeRoy garnered a trendy and adoring public, a cult celebrity following and a luxurious lifestyle - although that wasn't a constant for Knoop. When she wasn't playing LeRoy, she went back to San Francisco where she waitressed in a Thai restaurant, and no one had any idea about her dual life. </p> <p>You had to work?</p> <p>'Yes!'</p> <p>Playing JT didn't make you rich?</p> <p>She laughs. 'Nooooo!'</p> <p>Did the constant adjustments between the two lifestyles become confusing?</p> <p>'It screwed with my head! There was nothing special about the way I was going through my early twenties - apart from JT. What I loved so much was harbouring that secret; and going back and being able to say to myself: these guys don't know what's going on! I'm here! And I'm there, too!'</p> <p>JT LeRoy's relationship with Asia Argento is perhaps the most intriguing element of Knoop's experiences. She says that she's lost contact with everyone she met as JT, apart from one man, who was so unsettled by the truth that he doubted everything for a while. 'There was this thing where he was looking at everything and going: is this real? Is this spoon real? It shook, you know, everything. The truth that he thought he ... had.' But he did not sleep with JT LeRoy. Asia Argento did. </p> <p>Asia Argento met JT LeRoy on a book tour in Italy for Harold's End, LeRoy's last novel. Argento had been emailing Albert, as LeRoy, for a few months before that, but she transferred all her attentions to Knoop. They began a relationship.</p> <p>Argento must have known something was up.</p> <p>'She says she didn't! I don't think she can admit that she knew something was up. I think she probably did.'</p> <p>Because you were close - on every level. </p> <p>'Right.'</p> <p>Physically close...</p> <p>Knoop laughs. 'Right! Everyone goes, she was so naive to think anyone could have had a perfect sex change. But I don't know ...'</p> <p>I ask her if she felt guilty about cheating Argento into a relationship with her; Knoop doesn't really answer. 'It was unsettling, to be with her, and not be ... although I spent enough time with her at the end, so that basically I felt like we connected on so many other things. And it was this whole thing. At some point, I told Asia that she should call me Savannah. I don't know why.'</p> <p>Perhaps so that you could merge JT's identity with your own? So you could feel like you were telling her the truth, without actually telling her the truth?</p> <p>'Exactly. Right. It was all so close to the truth by that point. Anyway, she didn't call me Savannah. She always called me JT.'</p> <p>Did you fall in love with her?</p> <p>'I don't know.' She seems exasperated. 'I question that. It wasn't quite falling in love. I wanted her ... to tell me I was OK.'</p> <p>Perhaps Knoop doesn't feel guilty about Argento because Argento hurt Knoop. When Argento, Knoop and Michael Pitt were working together on the film adaptation of The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, Argento invited Knoop, as JT, and Michael Pitt, back to her hotel suite - and chose to spend the night with Pitt. Knoop was devastated; the whole episode is documented in Girl Boy Girl</p> <p>Do you think she's angry with you?</p> <p>'I think she's angry.'</p> <p>Are you sorry for that?</p> <p>'I feel like I want to talk to her about it.'</p> <p>Are you still angry with her over Pitt?</p> <p>'To a degree.' Pause. 'I read an interview about how she felt ... and the only thing she said was, she honestly thought I was a boy, because I had such hairy legs. She'd never seen such hair on a girl's legs! And I think: that's all? I think that if she read the book, she would understand why I did it. But I think we should ... talk about it. Hash it out.'</p> <p>I like Knoop very much. She is charismatic and engaging, and I find it exciting that people still do these kinds of things - have these exciting, preposterous adventures. I think she wanted to write her story for all the reasons she gives me - to get it down, to get it straight, to 'stop it falling through the cracks'. But also I suspect that Laura Albert's right when she suggests that Knoop misses the limelight, and this is her attempt to reclaim it. Knoop says she doesn't want to be famous: 'No! Not at all!' But she freely admits to feeling incredibly lost once the hoax was exposed. She admits that she misses the experience of JT LeRoy desperately, and that she misses having secrets 'to the point that I started trying to get other secrets, new secrets'. She laughs about that. She tells me that she loved being JT, that it was addictive, and fun 'and exciting and glamorous! He was really glamorous!'</p> <p>Would she have ever stopped being him, if she hadn't been found out?</p> <p>'No. I don't think so. No.'</p> <p>So maybe Savannah Knoop does want another go at celebrity, maybe she hasn't even quite admitted that to herself. She will say that she wants Tinc to grow, 'but not too big, I want to keep it close'; and that she wants Albert to make some peace with Girl Boy Girl. 'I think she just needs to start writing again.'</p> <p>So, I say, you want Laura Albert to get over it, and Asia Argento to get in touch?</p> <p>She grimaces.</p> <p>'I don't want that to be, like, my calling card! No! Like: call me, Asia! No! If our paths are meant to cross, then they will.'</p> <p>Do you believe in all that?</p> <p>'Probably not,' Savannah Knoop says. 'But sometimes - it happens anyway.'</p> <h2>Girl Boy Girl: Savannah faces the Italian press as JT LeRoy</h2> <p>At a JT LeRoy press conference for 'his' last book, Harold's End, in Rome, Savannah Knoop, disguised as JT, is accompanied by her sister-in-law and 'manager' Laura Albert and Loretta from the Italian publishers. It was here that she met, for the first time, Italian actress Asia Argento, with whom she then had an affair.</p> <p>Loretta dragged me to the podium. I could hear everyone getting into their seats. There were red glowing blindspots burned into my retinas. I could barely see Asia and Laura settled into two seats in the front row. Loretta tapped at the microphone and started to introduce me in Italian. I was shaking, and every so often I would jerk my head, like I was trying to pull a crick out of my neck. </p> <p>She said something and everyone laughed wryly. I could tell she was wrapping it up now. 'I present JT.' </p> <p>They clapped. Laura gestured to me to say something. I mustered a low 'Hi'. Someone coughed. What were they waiting for? Were they second-guessing me? People raised their hands. Loretta pointed at them. She seemed to know all of them. </p> <p>'Yes, Antonia.' Antonia shot off a question. Loretta nodded her head. She said, 'Ah, they want to know, what are the wig and glasses for?'</p> <p>I was relieved that we had started with something easy. 'Um,' I breathed heavily into the microphone, 'I put so much into the books. I wear the wig so that people won't recognise me, so that I can keep something for me that's personal. Same thing with my eyes.'</p> <p>I pushed a last breath into the microphone. The sunspots were receding. In practically all the interviews, this question came up in one form or another. The most direct had been in another city, when an interviewer said, 'You could be anybody. How do we know you are who you say you are? I mean, you sound like a woman to me.' The rest of the reporters muttered and shook their head at him, indignant that he had asked such a question. I would be saved each time by remembering Laura's rule: always go in further to get out. </p> <p>'Um, you don't know. And you won't know. And I don't want you to know. JT could be back in Spokane, a 500-pound black man, like that guy, the voice of Elmo, right? Some people say I am Dennis Cooper. Some people say I am really Gus Van Sant. I like that. I mean, yer absolutely right. I could be anybody. As fer sounding like a woman, thank you.' I curtsied. </p> <p>'You wrote on your website that writing is your lifesaver. Is it still true? Is it your raison d'\u00eatre?' My raison d'\u00eatre, I thought bitterly, is to put on a wig and speak in a lousy Southern accent.</p> <p>'Uh, yeah. I think it is the same today ...'</p> <p>'In your novel, Sarah says, \"We all need someone to know who we really are\". Today, do you know who you are?' </p> <p>'Um, no. No, I don't think I do.' </p> <p>After it was over, the reporters took a flurry of pictures, and I realised that the sunspots were actually from flashbulbs. Loretta led me off the podium. I stubbed my sneakers on the bricks and stumbled off.</p> <p>\u2022 Girl Boy Girl: How I Became JT LeRoy is published by Seven Stories Press.

  "<p>Republican presidential hopeful John McCain has started making his entrance at campaign rallies to 'Gonna Fly Now', the theme from the Rocky films that has come to accompany many a seemingly hopeless feat of endurance. Lagging behind Barack Obama in the polls, he wants us all to know he is still in with a fighting chance.</p> <p>As McCain starts to speak, the theme of the films persists. Rocky IV to be precise, when underdog Balboa confronted Ivan Drago, the soulless Soviet thug, three-parts Gulag indoctrination and one-part steroids. Socialism, McCain warns, is what will accompany Obama into the White House if a hoodwinked electorate lets him in. He is not joking, and his supporters believe him. Some have responded with cries of 'Barack's a Commie'.</p> <p>The other day, a news anchor in Florida asked Joe Biden, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, in all seriousness if Obama is a Marxist, while claims that the Democrats will seek to 'redistribute' the savings of wealthy Americans is actually becoming entrenched in 'Red State' lore.</p> <p>For anyone who has lived in a country like Britain, where socialist ideals (NHS, the state pension), if not socialism itself, have been tried with great success, this is perhaps the most laughable claim of the entire election.</p> <p>Both men have given detailed accounts of their economic policies and neither comes within a country mile of socialism. More important, they do not address the most fundamental and important elements of America's current economic troubles, which are so vast that, at this point, it may not immediately matter who is elected. </p> <p>One bank chief executive said: 'The worst thing for the markets would be Obama getting assassinated. The second worst thing would be McCain getting elected.'</p> <p>Obama or McCain will enter the White House saddled with the biggest deficit in history, the most volatile market conditions in almost a century, the weakest global growth outlook since the Seventies and a tinderbox of political instability in almost every corner of the world just waiting to be sparked into life by prolonged economic unrest. </p> <p>Of these historic problems, the gravity-defying deficit is perhaps the most immediately troubling. The next President, Treasury Secretary and Fed chief have been backed into a cul-de-sac by a $438bn deficit likely to balloon to more than $1 trillion in the next year. The massive weight of this deficit, and the fact that it will dictate everything from the value of the dollar to levels of economic activity and growth for the best part of a decade, will overshadow any move the administration wants to make on expenditure or taxation.</p> <p>Obama and McCain have both explained at length how they plan to tax different portions of society in an effort to pay for policy programmes and reduce the deficit. Obama plans to tax the wealthier end and cut taxes for many in the middle and lower echelons.</p> <p>It was in trying to explain this to an Ohio man known as 'Joe the Plumber' - whose first name is not Joe and who does not hold a plumbing licence - that Obama earned his 'socialist' monicker. He told this purported pipe-fitter that, if elected President, he wanted to 'spread the wealth around' a bit with his tax policy.</p> <p>Indeed he will, but his plans do not exactly read like the Communist Manifesto. For example, a man with a wife and two children earning $200,000 a year would get a $6,474 tax cut under Obama's plan. In the $100,000 income bracket McCain will grant you a $2,759 a year tax break, while Obama wins with $3,043. At the bottom, the difference is more marked. Obama will grant a working couple earning $25,000 a year between them $1,287 in tax cuts a year; McCain will give them nothing.</p> <p>At the top end of society though, in the $500,000-a-year bracket, McCain plans to leave taxes alone, while Obama will increase them by some $6,727 a year. </p> <p>Wall Street bankers remaining after the crunch are the ones facing the real tax increase under Obama. If you earn $2m a year, the Democrats will hit you with an extra $108,704 a year in taxes - assuming you don't salt it all away in a tax haven. McCain has a hike planned for the $2m bracket too, but only $1,122.</p> <p>But there is one key figure missing. The point of taxing people is to give government money to pay for social policy and infrastructure and so on; and, in times like these, to help lower the deficit.</p> <p>But, according to analysis of both candidate's promises by an organisation called Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, both McCain's and Obama's economic plans would increase the deficit by more than $200bn in 2013. So it seems that both prospective Presidents plan to do no more than shuffle the deck chairs on this dangerously listing ship.</p> <p>As for investors, Obama probably sang a verse of 'The Red Flag' when he decided to propose increasing capital gains taxes from 15 to 20 per cent for families earning more than $200,000. And he doubtless polished his Order of Lenin medal when he said he would tax 'carried interest' as ordinary income. McCain pledges to halve capital gains tax on stock held for more than a year to 7.5 per cent and increase the amount of stock loss deductible against ordinary income from $3,000 to $15,000. The latter element could come in pretty handy in this market.</p> <p>It's obvious to most people that Obama isn't a socialist nor McCain the epitome of neoconservatism. Both are relatively moderate, especially on economic policy. The biggest differences in wealth distribution can be seen at the upper end of the income bracket. If Obama wins, the top 1 per cent of earners can expect a tax increase of about $19,000 a year. If McCain wins, they will receive a tax cut of about $125,000.</p> <p>But these top 1 per centers will hardly be among the most important members of society for the next four years. If unemployment continues to rise, as it has in recent months, and big companies continue to lay off workers in the thousands, the bottom 1 per centers will need the most help. But neither candidate has very much planned for them at all.</p>",
  "<p>Niall Ferguson has written a brilliant book exploring the historic nexus between money, diplomacy, warfare and globalisation. It's called The House of Rothschild: The World's Banker 1849-1998. His new work, The Ascent of Money, written 10 years later, is an altogether different beast.</p> <p>From its opening sentence - 'Bread, cash, dosh, dough, loot, lucre, moolah, readies, the wherewithal: call it what you like, money matters' - you know this is a TV tie-in. But books and television scripts are not the same. This truth was best acknowledged by a TV book on the same subject as Ferguson's series. 'A book is a book and a television series is a set of television programmes,' wrote Peter Jay in Road to Riches. 'Both have their own demanding disciplines and imperatives; and neither can be made successfully as an image of the other.' While TV glories in the concrete and struggles with the abstract, written history can embrace both. As Jay explains: 'A book may make more demands on its reader and, in return, the reader may expect more matter from the author.' It is not a deal on which Ferguson delivers. </p> <p>The Ascent of Money is an account of 'moolah' from the Incas to the credit crunch and, with it, an argument for the centrality of finance to all elements of human history. With typical bravado, the thesis is modelled on Jacob Bronowski's masterful series, The Ascent of Man, with Ferguson positioning financial markets as 'the mirror of mankind', magnifying back to us our values, weaknesses and psychoses. 'Money amplifies our tendency to overreact, to swing from exuberance when things are going well to deep depression when they go wrong. Booms and busts are products of our emotional volatility.' And, barring the odd fluctuation, finance has, like Man, in Ferguson's account at least, ascended in good, Whiggish fashion 'unquestionably upwards'. It is a story of relentless progress that might not be wholly obvious to today's HBOS shareholders and Icelandic bank savers. </p> <p>This virtuous journey is presented to the reader in a barely concealed TV-script format, with all the tropes that discipline demands: the notion of secret discovery ('Behind every great historical phenomenon there lies a financial secret'); the importance of journey ('Read this book and you will understand why... '); the ever shorter, more emphatic sentences and the need for visual scene-setting. There is also a curious, irksome desire to refract the past through the personal: Ferguson's upbringing in Glasgow, his Calvinist heritage and early love of westerns all pepper the narrative. </p> <p>Such solipsism helps to crowd out the history as we hurtle through the role of money in Roman society, the undoing of the Hapsburg Empire thanks to New World inflation, Shylock and Venice, Florence and the Medici, and the finance bubbles of the 18th century. Inevitably, there are omissions and oversights: the story of social insurance fails to mention the schemes of Thomas Paine and Richard Price to alleviate poverty in the 18th century; finance and the Industrial Revolution receives a single sentence, while Ferguson's account of the 1860s cotton famine relies on fairly old scholarship. </p> <p>Worse than that is the lack of interest in the intellectual history of capital. George Soros gets more attention than Adam Smith and at a time when we are facing what Eric Hobsbawm has called 'the greatest crisis of capitalism since the 1930s', with Das Kapital a bestseller in Germany, is it credible to devote more space to Goldman Sachs's Jim O'Neill than the works of Karl Marx?</p> <p>However, when we reach the 19th century, Ferguson's powers are on formidable display. His critique of British imperial hegemony and Edwardian globalisation, and his explanation of the role of bond markets in 1930s German hyperinflation, mix financial, diplomatic and economic history with the fluency and clarity that only Ferguson is capable of. Alone among modern economic historians, he is able to present complex data in a consistently revelatory manner. </p> <p>The story he tells starkly underlines the ever-growing global dependence on an ever-more complex financial architecture. In 2000, there were 3,873 hedge funds with $490bn in assets. In the first quarter of 2008, there were 7,601 funds with $1.9 trillion in assets. The ins and outs of the Medici family are all very well, but Ferguson the Financial Times pundit is clearly bored by it and wants to move on swiftly to collateral debt obligations, sub-prime mortgages and the alchemy of longing and shorting. He is slavish in his devotion towards modern capital, its ever more innovative mutations and the masters of the universe who send it spiralling around the world. 'Ken Griffin loves risk,' begins a particularly oleaginous account of a hedge funder. 'Among the artworks that decorate his penthouse apartment on North Michigan Avenue is Jasper Johns's False Start, for which he paid $80m and a C\u00e9zanne which cost him $60m.' </p> <p>Ferguson will also brook no criticism of the international organs of finance and their 'Washington Consensus'. As far as he's concerned, the IMF was blameless in its response to the Asian financial crisis of the mid-1990s (which many regard as the nadir of neoliberal policy making), Pinochet saved Chilean democracy by following Milton Friedman's monetarist orthodoxy, while Robert Zoellick of the World Bank quickly metamorphoses into the familiar 'Bob.' The anti-globalisation critiques of Naomi Klein, Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman are clearly in his sights, but Ferguson uncharacteristically pulls his punches in this mostly anodyne text. </p> <p>Instead of an inquiring history, what we are left with is a reverential panorama of neoliberal capitalism. Above all, there is little investigation of the losers in the zero-sum game of money's ascent. The only possible cloud Ferguson spies on the future horizon of finance is democratic accountability, with its 'rules and regulations [that] can make previously good traits suddenly disadvantageous'. Quite where the Bear Stearns bail out and bank nationalisation fit into the picture is unclear. </p> <p>Indeed, much of this book has been overtaken by history and Ferguson looks like being left stranded as the last great hagiographer of hedge funds. As a trailer for the forthcoming TV series (which starts on Channel 4 on 17 November), his bullish stance works well enough, though I would recommend only watching the Panglossian Ferguson, and reading the more considered Jay. Books and television can complement each other - just not always by the same author.</p> <p>\u2022 Tristram Hunt's Penguin biography of Friedrich Engels will be published early next year</p>",
  "<p>Nobody likes to be told they are losing their looks as they age. Channel 4 was stung to read in The Observer that it was 'losing its appeal' ... as it 'stumbled into adulthood'. </p> <p>All mainstream UK media is experiencing declining audiences due to an explosion of digital media choices. Channel 4 has inevitably lost viewers in the migration from a four-channel TV universe to one of 400. We should be judged on how we've performed relative to our competitors and how our business is evolving to meet the challenge of a fully digital media marketplace. </p> <p>The core Channel 4 service has retained its appeal better than all its terrestrial rivals. Since 2003, for example, ITV1's viewing has declined by 21 per cent and BBC 2 is down 30 per cent. Channel 4 has lost just 12 per cent. The same pattern is true among younger audiences, with Channel 4's viewing among 16- to 34-year-olds declining half as fast as ITV1. This has not been achieved by diluting our editorial - Channel 4 again won more Bafta and Royal Television Society awards this year than any other channel. </p> <p>In response to massive structural shifts in global media, we have diversified through the launch of Film4, E4, More4, Channel 4+1, 4 Music and 4oD. Collectively, our channels enjoy a record 12 per cent of the total TV audience and are watched by nearly a fifth of all 16- to 34-year-olds. A decade ago, when Sky Digital heralded the digital revolution, Channel 4 had 10 per cent of viewing. We're one of an elite band of media companies which has experienced growth in recent years - ITV and the BBC have declined, despite adding new services. This success has helped to secure our highest-ever annual share of total TV advertising, in excess of 24 per cent.</p> <p>The financial performance of our digital channels has been transformed after years of loss-making. This year each digital service will make a profit; collectively they will contribute tens of millions of pounds to our bottom line. </p> <p>The desire to continue improving the financial contribution from our digital portfolio guided our planned investment in radio. We're not embarrassed that the rapid recent downturn has forced us to abandon this investment. Rather, we're frustrated that a valuable future profit stream has been denied to us. </p> <p>Were Channel 4 privately owned, this successful diversification would give us cause for optimism about the transition to digital. But, as a publicly owned broadcaster that does not receive a cash subsidy, Channel 4 faces the additional challenge of trying to maintain its investment in public service content. It is the cost of meeting our public service contribution that is the root of our much discussed funding gap, forecast to exceed \u00a3150m by 2012. </p> <p>There is an easy way to close this gap - stop producing the range of high-quality but economically unviable content that we outlined in our Next on 4 creative blueprint: Channel 4 News; an hour-long Dispatches and Cutting Edge most weeks; documentaries about history, science, religion; original British comedies; single dramas such as The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall; British films such as this week's London Film Festival finale Slumdog Millionaire; major arts projects such as Steve McQueen's Hunger. This and much more will be lost if Channel 4 withers for want of proper public support. The 22,000 jobs we support in independent production and the \u00a32bn generated for the UK economy will also be under threat. </p> <p>ITV has already abandoned most of its public service obligations. If Channel 4 is obliged by deteriorating finances to do the same, the BBC will be the sole meaningful provider. The market will not pick up the slack. Only a fully funded Channel 4 can guarantee ongoing competition to the BBC of real scale and impact - which is what the public demands.</p> <p>The board of Channel 4 is committed to preserving it as a public purpose organisation. The government has long dismissed the option of privatisation, recognising Channel 4 as a successful public/private hybrid and a cornerstone of the UK's creative industries. The Conservatives have also reiterated their opposition. Now political will must be turned into meaningful support. </p> <p>We are already having to cut spending on programmes by more than \u00a350m in response to the downturn. Ofcom has broadly accepted the size and timing of our gap and agrees a new funding mechanism is a 'pressing priority'. The government has indicated willingness to take decisions early in the new year. All that remains to be decided (urgently) is where new support for Channel 4 should be sourced. </p> <p>If we are given certainty about funding, we can release money from our reserves to restore our creative investment while we wait for a new mechanism to be implemented. Suddenly the transition from analogue adolescence to digital adulthood won't seem so daunting after all.</p>",

  "<p>The most rewarding aspect of editing a hotel guide is unearthing new discoveries to share with friends and readers. These newcomers bring fresh energy to a guide while offering new treats for even the most jaded palate.</p> <p>Every year we drop between 80-100 hotels from the Good Hotel Guide as owners sell out, retire, or perhaps just lose their way. The compensation for the loss of old favourites is the inclusion of an equal number of new finds. And because we regard the presence of a hands-on owner as a key ingredient, there is a story to tell at each of these discoveries. </p> <p>For the 2009 edition, some newcomers have considerable previous experience. No one knows more about opening a new hotel than G\u00e9rard and Nina Basset. One of Britain's leading sommeliers, he was a co-founder of the Hotel du Vin group; she was once the youngest AA hotel inspector. There was no danger that they might head for a beach in the Bahamas after the sale of the du Vin group. They found an old country house in the New Forest, gave it a stylish make-over, hired a good chef and added an exceptional wine list, and opened it as the Hotel Terravina.</p> <p>When Emily Watson, sous-chef to Heston Blumenthal at the Fat Duck in Bray, decided to break out on her own, she chose to open a dining pub with rooms, rather than a restaurant. She has renovated a traditional 'drinking pub' on the green of Kingham, nominated England's favourite village by Country Life magazine. Both the food and the bedrooms are good value for the Cotswolds, and you might find triple-cooked chips on the menu.</p> <p>My own favourite on this list is a simpler affair in the tranquil hills above Ludlow. Tracey Bayliss and Alex Read have lovingly rebuilt two old cottages which they run as a B&amp;B. It is very much their family home, run on green lines, but visitors, children and pets are all made to feel very welcome.</p> <h2>Coastal treats</h2> <p><strong>1.

  "<p>Marcus du Sautoy is an odd sight even by the standards set by other Oxford dons. With his checked trousers, purple T-shirts and pink sweaters, he has the appearance of a man who has dressed himself in the first clothes that came to hand when he opened his wardrobe that morning. Elegant is not the word for him. He stands out, especially among his fellow mathematicians for whom a cardigan and slippers, or possibly a safari jacket and sandals, are considered the acme of good taste.</p> <p>There is, in short, a little of the studied, flamboyant eccentric to Oxford's new Simonyi professor of the public understanding of science, a post recently relinquished by its first incumbent, Richard Dawkins, after he had reached the end of his term in office. We should not underestimate the merits of du Sautoy for all his populist credentials and dubious taste in clothes, however. He is energetic, committed, eclectic in his interests and the possessor of a first-rate mind. Thus his appointment has been widely welcomed by UK academics. 'I am absolutely thrilled by this news. He has done more than anyone else in a generation to popularise mathematics,' said Surrey University professor Jim al-Khalili. </p> <p>'It is an excellent decision,' added Kathy Sykes, professor of sciences and society at Bristol University. 'He has the creativity and the humanity to do really well. I am sure he is going to be a success.'</p> <p>His winning of the Berwick Prize, one of mathematics' most prestigious awards, in 2001 underlines the depth of du Sautoy's intellect. Then there are his media interests. He has presented TV programmes such as Mind Games and is also a writer with a proven record of turning arcane maths into entertaining prose for books such as Finding Moonshine (about mathematical symmetry) and The Music of the Primes. The latter subject turns out to be a particular interest. Indeed, primes - numbers that are divisible only by themselves and by one - permeate his life. 'Every number is built by multiplying prime numbers - 105, for example, is three times five times seven,' he says. 'They are like the atoms of arithmetic - the hydrogen and oxygen of the world of numbers.'</p> <p>It remains to be seen how well these passions and talents will help him in his new post, however. His professorship represents a very different challenge, a point stressed by Sykes. 'Science now fills every crevice of modern society and we can no longer leave scientists alone in their ivory towers to get on with their jobs. They have to explain what they are doing and a post like this one gives a scientist space and time to explain the roles that their fellow scientists play in society.'</p> <p>And while Dawkins is a superb writer and was assiduous in attacking and ridiculing the new age, anti-science absurdities of today, Sykes believes du Sautoy will make his mark in the job in a very different way. 'Richard [Dawkins] was uncompromising in his attitude and made a point of standing at one polar extreme in the battle against those who oppose science. I think Marcus will be more interested in the grey area between these two poles. He is certainly very open-minded and likes to compromise.'</p> <p>Simon Singh, a mathematics writer and a friend, also sounded a note of caution. 'Marcus is immensely energetic and will bring real commitment to the job. However, I think it would be a mistake if he confined himself to his subject. He needs to confront issues such as creationism, GM foods, stem cell science and global warming, for example. These are all key scientific concerns of the day and he must face them. He will have to take a broad approach to his job.'</p> <p>An avowed atheist, du Sautoy will certainly take a firm line on the teaching of creationism in schools. Nevertheless, he is a numbers man at heart and very sensitive to those who attack mathematics. Last week, he maintained a conciliatory stance in most interviews concerning his appointment, but was careful to single out one target: Simon Jenkins. The columnist wrote in the Guardian a few months ago that he considered mathematics to be a waste of time, that it was less useful than Latin and Greek and that it deserved no support from the public. For his part, du Sautoy was unamused. 'I presume he [Jenkins] did badly at the subject at school and has held a grudge against it ever since,' he said in an interview with The Observer last week. 'It simply isn't true, of course. Mathematics underpins all of science and the technology that runs our lives.'</p> <p>Nor is it true that the public is scared of the subject, he claims. A keen footballer (for his local club, Recreativo Hackney), du Sautoy says that his team-mates - none of them scientists - were engrossed by coverage of the opening of the giant atom-smasher, the Large Hadron Collider, at Cern in Geneva a few weeks ago. 'We talked about it a great deal. It involved some maths but no one was worried about that. The point was there was real interest in the subject.'</p> <p>Apart from numbers, football turns out to be his life's passion. He is an Arsenal season ticket holder, while his household's cat is called Freddie Ljungberg, after the Gunners' former midfielder. When playing for Recreativo, he is noted for tackling that is decidedly robust, his physicality recently requiring the intervention of team-mates on a club trip to Spain. For a man who recently turned 43, such athletic commitment is commendable, if nothing else. Not that du Sautoy worries about his age. Forty-three is a prime number, he points out. You cannot do better than that.</p> <p>Hence du Sautoy's insistence in playing with 17 on his shirt at Recreativo. Play with the power of the prime and you cannot lose, he says, which is why David Beckham was right to wear 23 when he moved to Real Madrid. 'All the key players at Real Madrid were then playing in prime-number shirts: [Roberto] Carlos at 3, [Zin\u00e9dine] Zidane at 5, Ra\u00fal at 7, and Ronaldo at 11. Having signed a new building block, Beckham had to be given a prime-number shirt, too.' </p> <p>This is a man who knows how to bring mathematics to everyday life, if nothing else. Yet mathematics was never his top subject at school - a comprehensive in Henley - where he performed poorly at sums. It was only when a mathematics teacher took him aside and explained the joys of numbers that he suddenly got the bug. 'At the time, I wanted to be a spy,' he recalls. 'My mother worked for the Foreign Office and I was convinced - wrongly as it turns out - that she was a secret agent. So I began learning different languages so I could be a spy as well. But I found it frustrating: all those irregular verbs and nouns. There was no pattern. Then I discovered mathematics: the perfect language. With it, everything is logical and consistent.'</p> <p>It was, in short, love at first sight. While still a schoolboy, du Sautoy visited Blackwell's bookshop in Oxford. 'I watched undergraduates lounging around reading the hieroglyphs that covered the pages of maths books as if they were digesting sentences in English. I thought, I am going to do that one day.' </p> <p>In fact, du Sautoy has gone much further than that. After getting a scholarship to study at Wadham College, Oxford, he gained a first in mathematics and won a fellowship at All Souls. Today, he is a professor of mathematics at Oxford, a position he will hold while fulfilling the obligations of his new post. He not only reads those mathematical hieroglyphs with ease, he writes them. They are the words and sentences of his day-to-day life.</p> <p>It is not an easy trade, however. Indeed, mathematics can be cruel and unforgiving. He is fond of quoting Julia Robinson, a Berkeley professor who dedicated her life to finding equations to predict prime numbers and who outlined a typical mathematician's week: 'Monday - tried to prove theorem; Tuesday - tried to prove theorem; Wednesday - tried to prove theorem; Thursday - tried to prove theorem; Friday - theorem false.'</p> <p>Nevertheless, there is a thrill to the subject that ensnares its practitioners and du Sautoy - who is married with one son, aged 12, and twin adopted daughters, aged five - has been keen to share that passion through a striking range of outlets. Most recently, he worked with Simon McBurney, founder of theatre company Complicite, in the devising of A Disappearing Number. The play tells the story of the collaboration between mathematicians Srinivasa Ramanujan, a poor Brahmin from southern India, and Cambridge don GH Hardy. Prime numbers, needless to say, feature in just about every scene.</p> <p>As to his heroes, du Sautoy says he is an admirer of Evariste Galois, the young French mathematician whose work as a teenager led to the creation of Galois theory, a field of abstract algebra, and whose commitment to the Republican cause led to his death, aged 20, after a duel in 1832.

  "<p>Parts of the world may have to be abandoned because severe water shortages will leave them uninhabitable, the United Nations environment chief has warned.</p> <p>Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said water shortages caused by over-use of rivers and aquifers were already leading to serious problems, even in rich nations. With climate change expected to reduce rainfall in some places and cause droughts in others, some regions could become 'economic deserts', unviable for people or agriculture, he said. </p> <p>Steiner argued that only urgent action to combat global warming and poverty could prevent the creation of thousands of 'environmental refugees'. Previous UN agreements to reduce global warming emissions and the Millennium Development Goals on poverty had not been met. His warning echoes those of other environment leaders, who have said that water shortages could be the greatest threat posed by climate change.</p> <p>'In many ways [water] is the most dramatic expression of mismanagement of natural or nature-based assets,' Steiner said. 'The day a person or a community is bereft of water is the day that your chance of even the most basic life or livelihood is gone and economic activity seeps away.</p> <p>'Unchecked climate change will mean that some parts of the world will simply not have enough water to sustain settlements both small and large, because agriculture becomes untenable and industries relying on water can no longer compete or function effectively. This will trigger structural changes in economies right through to the displacement of people as environmental refugees.'</p> <p>Steiner said it was not possible to identify specific places at risk, but said vulnerable areas were those which were already considered to be 'water scarce' because of dry weather and a lack of infrastructure to store and transport water. Last week a study of the water footprints of 200 nations led by conservation group WWF warned that 50 countries were already experiencing 'moderate to severe water stress on a year-round basis'.</p> <p>This week experts from the UN Convention to Combat Desertification meeting in Turkey will warn that high food prices and endemic droughts are jeopardising the lives of hundreds of millions of people, particularly in Africa.</p> <p>Some of the most dramatic examples of water shortages this year include conflict-stricken Sudan, the dramatic drying of Lake Faguibine in Mali on which 200,000 mostly nomadic people depend, fatal clashes over drying boreholes in northern Kenya, and economic and social crisis on the sparsely populated border between Bolivia and Argentina, according to Unep. Oxfam has estimated that 25 million people have been affected by the most recent drought in Ethiopia.</p> <p>Rich nations are not immune. California has declared a state of emergency over water shortages, Australia has committed billions of dollars to cope with drought, and governments in Europe have been forced to ship in water to stop communities running dry.</p> <p>'A plant, never mind a human being, simply cannot live without water,' said Steiner. 'It's not a matter of how we can live for three years without some water; these are not the kind of things we can do for a while and recover.</p> <p>'In rich countries, there's always the potential of channelling water from one river basin to another. But even there people are hitting the limits of what we can do with money and infrastructure because there simply isn't enough water any more.'</p> <p>Suggested solutions include better enforcement of restrictions on over-use of rivers, lakes and aquifers, more efficient use of water and increases in technologies to recycle and desalinate water. </p> <p>Experts at the International Water Association congress in September called for investment in water infrastructure to at least double from the current level of $80bn (\u00a349bn) a year to avoid widespread flooding, drought and disease.</p> <p>Unep has calculated that enough rain falls on Africa to theoretically supply the needs of 13 billion people, and has called for a continent-wide rainwater harvesting programme.</p>",
  "<p>It's hard to imagine why humans would have chosen the achingly arid stone desert of Wadi Faynan for their first settlement. But water would have been one important reason, says archaeologist Steven Mithen. When Neolithic men and women arrived 11,500 years ago, things were very different: the climate was cooler and wetter; the landscape was covered in vegetation including wild figs, legumes and cereals, and there would have been wild goats and ibex for meat.</p> <p>Initially WF16, as it's now called, would have been a seasonal camp. But Mithen, professor of early prehistory at the University of Reading, and his fellow archaeologist Bill Finlayson believe that, gradually, people stayed longer. Sifting evidence from so long ago, the archaeologists can't be sure, but remains of food from different seasons and the scale of 'rubbish' piles suggest that about 10,000 years ago the inhabitants stopped moving altogether. If they are right, it would make this one of the oldest sites ever found where humans made a permanent settlement, learned to farm, and changed the course of human civilisation. But the tiny community drawn to water, which attracted successive waves of settlements, would eventually all but destroy the resource which made life possible. It is a pattern that's been repeated for millennia, around the world, and it now threatens us on a global scale.</p> <p>First people cut trees for shelter and fuel, until rains swept away the soil instead of seeping into shallow aquifers, and the springs dried up. At least as long ago as the Bronze Age, farmers began mankind's obsession with diverting water for crops to feed the growing population. Meanwhile, the moist, cool climate which encouraged the first settlement was naturally becoming drier and hotter.</p> <p>At least twice, historians believe, Wadi Faynan was abandoned. The first time possibly because of a sharp change in the climate, and later because it became too polluted. Today, Bedouin who survive in the valley have laid pipes down the dry stream bed to suck what is left of the spring in order to irrigate fields of tomatoes they have scratched out of the dry soil. But it's getting harder. According to local water lore, good rains now come in less than every other year.</p> <p>The farmers in Wadi Faynan are not alone. Like communities around the world, they are paying the price for thousands of years of exploitation of our environment. Already, 1bn people do not have enough clean water to drink, and at least 2bn cannot rely on adequate water to drink, clean and eat - let alone have enough left for nature. Lack of water is blamed for many of the world's most distressing crises: millions of deaths each year from disease and malnutrition, chronic hunger, keeping children away from schools which offer hope of a better life. Mostly it is the poor who suffer, but increasingly rich nations are struggling, too. Australia has endured so many dry years that a leading climatologist has said it's time to stop saying 'gripped by drought' and accept that the lack of rain is permanent. </p> <p>In parts of the US supplies are so vulnerable that last autumn the Red Cross delivered water parcels to the town of Orme in Tennessee. 'I thought, \"That can't be the Red Cross. We're Americans!\"' resident Susan Anderson told a reporter. In California, some farmers abandoned their crops this year as Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared the first state-wide drought for 17 years. Meanwhile Barcelona was so desperate that it began importing tankers of water from cities along the coast. Even in the notoriously wet UK, water has become such a problem in the crowded southeast that one company plans to build a desalination plant, the sort of desperate measure associated with oil-rich desert states.</p> <p>The Stockholm International Water Institute talks about 'an acute and devastating humanitarian crisis'; the founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, warns of a 'perfect storm'; Ban Ki-Moon, the United Nations Secretary General, has raised the spectre of 'water wars'. And, as the population keeps growing and getting richer, and global warming changes the climate, experts are warning that unless something is done, billions more will suffer lack of water - precipitating hunger, disease, migration and ultimately conflict.</p> <p>In a bid to avert this catastrophe, politicians, economists and engineers are pressing for dramatic changes to the way water is managed, from tree planting and simple storage wells, to multibillion dollar schemes to replumb the planet with dams and pipes, or manufacture freshwater from sewers and the sea. </p> <p>The water crisis is an expression of the environmental catastrophe of human over-exploitation. This is the age the Nobel prize-winning chemist Paul Crutzen has called 'the Anthropocene', because the natural system has been so fundamentally altered by human activity. And it all began when people settled down and began to chop wood and farm.</p> <p>'The start of sedentary communities is the start of the need to manage fresh water supplies,' says Steven Mithen. 'This is a starting point for our whole modern dilemma. It's gone from the concerns of individual settlements, to cities, to nations, and it's now a global issue.'</p> <p>There is, in theory, plenty of water on the earth to sustain its 6.5bn people. More than 97 per cent of all the water on the planet is salt water, and most of the freshwater is locked up in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. But that still leaves 10m cubic kilometres (km3) of usable water, circulating in cycles of evaporation and precipitation between the atmosphere and earth, where it appears in underground aquifers, lakes and rivers, glaciers, snowpacks, wetlands, permafrost and soil. Each km3 is equivalent to 1,000bn litres, or 1bn tonnes, of water - about the remaining annual flow of the River Nile. </p> <p>On the other side of the equation, the UN says individuals need five litres of water a day simply to survive in a moderate climate, and at least 50 litres a day for drinking and cooking, bathing and sanitation. Industry accounts for about double the average domestic use. But agriculture needs much, much more - in fact, 90 per cent of all water used by humans. The water is not 'lost' from earth, but over-abstraction by irrigators means it is often moved from where it is needed. Tony Allan, of King's College London, estimates that, together, 6.5bn people need 8,000km3 of water each year - a fraction of what is theoretically available. 'There's certainly enough water for every person on the planet, but too often it's in the wrong places at the wrong times in the wrong amounts,' says Marq de Villiers, author of the 2001 book Water Wars</p> <p>Three hours north of Wadi Faynan is the much greener Wadi Esseir, where Salah Al-Mherat and his family are one of millions of households in Jordan who feel the daily effects of inhabiting one of the driest countries on earth. Once a week, Al-Mherat gets water from the local irrigation co-operative for his fig, lemon, olive and grenadine trees and vegetables. For the rest he relies on rain. But since the Nineties the springs have been drying, sapped by demand from the nearby capital, Amman, and rain has been declining. </p> <p>On a hot morning in April, Al-Mherat comes in from picking petits-pois, hitches up his smock and settles on to a pile of cushions. Fidgeting with a pot of scented tea he explains that the crops now barely cover their costs; he has to work as a security guard to supplement his income. 'When I started it was very good compared to now,' he says. 'The first impact was that the size of the irrigated area became reduced. People also changed what they irrigated, so the water now goes mainly to the trees - some farmers stopped completely from doing vegetables.' Al-Mherat says he keeps hoping things will improve, because he will pass the land to his sons. 'It's my life,' he says. 'But even if I'm positive, the reality is it's like the wish of the devil to go to paradise.'</p> <p>Global population, economic development and a growing appetite for meat, dairy and fish protein have raised human water demand sixfold in 50 years. Meanwhile, supplies have been diminished in several ways: an estimated 845,000 dams block most of the world's rivers, depriving downstream communities of water and sediment, and increasing evaporation; up to half of water is lost in leakage; another 1bn people simply have no proper infrastructure; and the water left is often polluted by chemicals and heavy metals from farms and industry, blamed by the UN for poisoning more than 100m people. And still the rains are getting less reliable in many areas.</p> <p>Underlying these problems is a paradox. Because water, and the movement of water, is essential for life, and central to many religions, it is traditionally regarded as a 'common' good. But no individuals are responsible for it. From Wadi Esseir to the arid American Midwest, farmers either do not pay for water or pay a fraction of what homeowners pay, so they have less incentive to conserve it and might deprive suppliers of funds to improve infrastructure.</p> <p>The UN defines 'water scarcity' as fewer than 1,000m3 of renewable clean water for each person every year to drink, clean, grow food and run industry. By this measure half the world's population lives in countries suffering water scarcity. Jordan is one of the most water-scarce countries on earth, averaging just 160m3 of renewable water per person per year. </p> <p>The result is that it is not just farmers who are rationed. The Al-Mherat family, like the rest of greater Amman, only get water to their house one day a week. A city of more than 2m people runs to the rhythm of 'water day', says Dr Khadija Darmame, who is part of a \u00a31.25m project organised by Mithen and sponsored by Britain's Leverhulme Trust to study links between 'water, life and civilisation' in Jordan, from the earliest settlements to modern day. </p> <p>Poor supplies and stagnant tanks occasionally lead to infections. But for most, the problem is drudgery. 'The first thing is to do the maximum laundry and then clean the house,' says Darmame. Children and men take a shower, 'and the last thing is for the women to take a shower, and then you need a few hours to fill the tanks,' stacked on every roof. </p> <p>For millions of others, bad supplies are a question of life and death. Lack of clean drinking water and sanitation are largely blamed for the death of 11m children under five each year from disease and malnutrition; for nearly 1bn people who are chronically hungry; for 2bn who suffer what the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization calls 'food insecurity', because they do not have adequate food and nutrition for an 'active and healthy life'; and for keeping more than 60m girls out of school. These people then get caught in a water and poverty trap: two-thirds of the people who lack enough water for even the most basic needs live on less than $2 a day. 'Variability of water availability is strongly and negatively related to per capita income,' says Professor Jeffrey Sachs, author of Common Wealth: Economics For a Crowded Planet, and a special adviser to the UN Secretary General. Poor health, lack of education and hunger make it hard to escape. </p> <p>Ultimately, lack of water is seen as a threat to peace. From genocide in Darfur to rows between states in India and the US, Ban Ki-Moon is one of several global leaders who have warned of further legal and armed disputes over water. Intuitively it is obvious people will fight over their most precious resource, but so far few conflicts have broken out. The idea of 'water wars' seized the public imagination in 2001 when Marq de Villiers's book of that name was published in the UK, but the author disagreed with the publisher's choice of title. De Villiers agrees that water is often an underlying cause of tension, but has only identified one water 'war', between Egypt and Sudan. 'You cannot do without water, so when shortages pinch, states do co-operate and compromise,' he says.</p> <p>But if half the world's population lives in water-stressed countries, how do so many, from the breadbaskets of Asia to the sprawling cities in the arid American west, keep watering fields and running taps?</p> <p>One reason is that water flows uphill to money, as the saying goes. Thus people in oil-rich Kuwait enjoy expensive desalination, while Palestinians suffer daily hardship; tourists in Amman can turn on the tap at any time, while those in the poorest areas of the city have access to water for a few hours each week. As Tony Allan says: 'Water shortages don't pose serious problems to gardeners in Hampshire or California homeowners with pools to fill.'</p> <p>Another answer to the conundrum was identified by Allan, who in the Sixties became curious about why Middle Eastern countries without abundant water supplies were not suffering from a more obvious water crisis. The answer, he realised, was trade: by buying food, water-poor societies were 'buying' what he dubbed 'virtual water'. They were helped by farmers dumping grain into the world market once subsidies created massive over-supply. 'This potential tragedy was motoring on and hit the calm waters of the Americans and Europeans providing food [for the world market] at half cost, and the water contained in that food [was water] they didn't have to find.' </p> <p>The other answer is that communities around the world have been forced to tap rivers and lakes and aquifers, sometimes millions of years old, far beyond the limit at which they can replenish themselves. Above ground, lakes are shrinking and rivers are being reduced to pathetic flows, or drying up altogether. Below ground, a largely invisible crisis is unfolding as millions of wells have been sunk into aquifers - 4m in Bangladesh alone. Many aquifers are replenishable, but not all, and many that can be recharged don't get enough rain to match demand. Sometimes the empty cavities simply collapse, putting them beyond use forever. In his recent book, Plan B 3.0, Lester Brown catalogues the results. In the breadbaskets of China, India, the US, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Israel and Mexico, water tables are falling, sometimes by many metres a year. Pumps are being drilled a kilometre or more to find water, thousands more wells have dried up altogether and agricultural yields are shrinking. These countries contain more than half the world's people and produce most of its grain, warns Brown. Meanwhile, almost forgotten amid the human suffering are the terrible consequences for the natural world: freshwater fish populations fell by half between 1970 and 2000, says the UN.</p> <p>All these dams and irrigation channels and pumps and pipes allow billions of people to run up a gigantic global water overdraft. What worries experts is that there is no sign of humans withdrawing less water.</p> <p>Two years ago, the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) published a report by 700 experts warning that one in three people were 'enduring one form or another of water scarcity'. 'Scarcity for me is when women work hard to get water, [or] you want to allocate more but can't,' says David Molden, deputy director of the Sri Lanka-based organisation.</p> <p>Molden warns that the situation is becoming 'a little bit more critical', because of continuing rising demand for food, the recent boom in biofuels and climate change. To that can also be added another, poignant 'demand': the long-overdue realisation that nature also needs water, which in Europe and other countries has led to laws to ensure 'minimum environmental flows' remain in place.</p> <p>For food alone, the World Bank estimates that demand for water will rise 50 per cent by 2030, and the IWMI fears it could nearly double by 2050. Whether these crops require rain or irrigation depends on where they are grown, and how much rain there is. </p> <p>Like a great river fed by many tributaries, water is a conduit for the various effects of global warming: more variable rainfall, more floods, more droughts, the melting of glaciers on which 1bn people depend for summer river flows, and rising sea levels, threatening to inundate not just coastal communities but also their freshwater aquifers, river deltas and wetlands. </p> <p>From the headline figures, climate change should be good news. Crudely, scientists estimate for every 1C rise in the average global temperature, precipitation will increase one per cent, as warmer air absorbs more moisture. The world's total volume would not change, but it would be recycled more quickly, affecting the majority of the world's agriculture which depends on the volume and timing of rainfall.</p> <p>Balancing all these impacts, Nigel Arnell, director of Reading University's Walker Institute for Climate Change, calculates that the number of people living in water basins exposed to water stress will rise from 1.4bn to 2.9-3.3bn by 2025 and to 3.4-5.6bn by 2055. In fact, the greatest impact in Arnell's modelling is from rising populations, particularly in China and India, and, globally, climate change is actually reducing exposure to shortages. This may be good news for some, but masks huge disruption, as some regions fear too much water, while hundreds of millions of people start to run out.</p> <p>It is impossible to attribute one farm's difficulties or one year's rainfall to climate change. But if climate is the statistics of weather, then the rain gauge this year on the farm of Sameeh Al-Nuimat, northwest of Amman, is typical of what the experts forecast. Al-Nuimat had noticed a gradual decline in rainfall for years, but this year it dropped off steeply and there was no rain at all in March, a critical time for summer crops. 'My father told me he'd never seen such a year,' he says.</p> <p>Such dramatic events have injected urgency into discussions about Jordan's precarious water supplies, says Al-Nuimat, who is also an irrigation engineer at the Ministry of Agriculture. 'Before, when water was available, no one worried about it. But now there's interest - every night people speaking, every night debating, at every level, from the farmer to the planner to the politician. As a farmer I'd like to see drought-resistant crops; from a civil engineering point of view we should look for mega projects; and, if you're thinking about global planning, there should be acceptance of people moving from water-scarce regions to where water is available.' </p> <p>Around the world the same debates are under way. Rich countries can make significant gains from domestic efficiency, but most of the world's population does not have power showers and swimming pools, or waste great quantities of food. Instead the main focus is on reducing water in agriculture, through more efficient irrigation, by engineering seeds to grow in more arid and salty conditions, and even shifting crops. 'If the world were my farm, I'd grow things in different places,' says David Molden. But even benign-sounding conservation is often unpopular. There is widespread resistance to raising prices for water (or energy for pumping) to increase efficiency, suspicion of genetic modification, and a reluctance among farmers to abandon water-hungry but lucrative crops when they are struggling to feed their family. 'It's a socioeconomic dilemma,' says Al-Nuimat. 'You can't stop now: it's the source of their life.'</p> <p>Faced with public apathy and even resistance, responses have tended to focus on increasing supply. For decades the scale of ambition has been like a game of global engineering one-upmanship: rivers have been diverted across countries, pumps sunk kilometres into fossil aquifers, and bigger plants commissioned to recycle or desalinate water. And there is no sign of a let-up. As shortages become more desperate and costs and energy use fall, Global Water Intelligence forecasts that desalination capacity will more than double by 2015, and the potential to increase wastewater recycling is enormous, being only 2 per cent of volume. </p> <p>But huge costs, environmental concerns and public distaste for drinking their 'waste' has forced many communities to reconsider simpler, traditional methods, too. Some of the ideas the earliest farmers would have recognised: tree replanting, ripping out thirsty non-native plants, stone walls to hold back erosion, and rain harvesting with simple ponds and tanks. Some have even urged a return to more vegetarian diets, which at their extreme demand only half the water of a typical American meat-eater's. This is, according to Lord Haskins, the former chairman of Britain's Northern Foods group and a government adviser, 'the most virtuous and responsible step of all'.</p> <p>And when all options are exhausted at home, countries have another option: to import water in food and even industrial goods. Political meddling with subsidies makes trade a controversial 'solution', but by favouring regions with a 'competitive advantage' in water it can work. Globally the IWMI estimates irrigation demand would be 11 per cent higher without trade, and quotes a projection that imports can cut future irrigation by another 19-38 per cent by 2025. Saudi Arabia has gone further than most, announcing in February that it would stop all wheat production in a few years, though other countries might now be deterred by higher food prices.</p> <p>Ultimately governments are being forced down several paths at once: to raise prices to reflect the true value of water to humans and the environment, invest in technology to improve efficiency and supplies, engage in more trade, and make peace with neighbours that can hold up incoming water or food. These will only be possible, though, if people can be lifted out of poverty, to afford higher prices, capital spending and imports. 'When you diversify your economy you solve your problems,' says Allan.</p> <p>Looking back at the history of mankind's struggle for enough water, experience suggests the initiative which enabled humans to settle, farm and dominate the planet will provide many solutions. But sometimes we might have to accept defeat. 'On the one hand you can see this amazing technological ingenuity of humans, which throughout prehistory and history continually invented new ways to manage water supply,' says Mithen. 'On the other, the story of the past tells us that sometimes, however brilliant your technological inventions, they are just not good enough, and you get periods of abandonment of landscapes. We have got to be prepared to invest in technology, but also to recognise in some parts of the world there are going to be areas where we're going to have to say \"enough's enough\".'</p> <p>A person uses about 50 litres of water a day; industry accounts for double that. But agriculture needs much more - in fact, 90 per cent of all water used by humans.</p> <h2>Liquid assets</h2> <p><strong>How much water does it take to make a can of coke?

But taking the idea a step further on to food labels which would reach millions of consumers is proving harder, says Dave Tickner, head of the WWF UK's freshwater programme.</p> <p><strong>Is all water the same?</strong><br>Unlike carbon, water is a local issue.

  "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer is relying on stars such as Take That and Robson Green to win back disillusioned female shoppers this Christmas after its clothing market share losses accelerated over the last quarter.</p> <p>The waning appeal of M&amp;S's womenswear comes at a time when its food business is also in trouble. Executive chairman Sir Stuart Rose is due to report that first-half profits are down more than a third, at \u00a3290m, on Tuesday. </p> <p>M&amp;S is the UK's biggest women's clothing retailer but according to industry figures its market share by sales value has declined sharply since July. The data, which plots sales over the 26 weeks to 7 September against the same period a year ago, also shows that menswear is down, but not as markedly. It revealed strong gains in childrenswear.</p> <p>The deterioration is likely to have informed M&amp;S's decision to launch a new clothing brand called Portfolio, aimed at women over 45, next year. Some analysts fear M&amp;S has alienated this core demographic as it sought to broaden its appeal. </p> <p>This week's results meeting will be key to restoring faith in Rose's leadership as M&amp;S heads into the Christmas trading period. He had been credited with the turnaround of the retailer but its recovery proved to be a false dawn. Last year's poor Christmas trading was followed by weak sales this year. The retailer also upset investors by ignoring corporate governance rules and promoting Rose to executive chairman this summer.</p> <p>The reversal of fortunes has weighed heavily on M&amp;S shares, which have collapsed from 652p a year ago to just 219p. The decision to pursue a multi-billion-pound store refurbishment programme has also been condemned by analysts, who have pencilled in full-year profits of \u00a3667m, far short of last year's \u00a31bn. Indeed, many analysts now predict M&amp;S will be forced to disappoint its legions of small shareholders by slashing its dividend next year.</p> <p>M&amp;S will launch its Christmas offensive next week with starry ads featuring Take That as well as its roster of models including Twiggy and Erin O'Connor. TV actor Green will lend his voice to a food campaign showcasing festive treats such as 'mini' melt-in-the-middle Christmas puddings. 'Customers are looking for tradition and comfort this Christmas and we are trying to appeal to the way they are feeling,' said M&amp;S marketing director Steven Sharp.</p> <p>However, the Christmas trading environment promises to be cut-throat this year as retailers look to serve customers who, for the first time in a decade, feel poorer as the country stares down a recession. Debenhams' chief executive Rob Templeman said consumers had already begun buying presents as they looked to spread the cost. Templeman warned that he wasn't afraid to start a high-street price war, stating it would 'invest margin' in tactical price cuts if the run into Christmas proved tough.</p> <p>Beyond Christmas, analysts are worried about the long-term health of M&amp;S's food business, which is suffering as consumers trade down to discounters like Aldi. M&amp;S head of food John Dixon said it had been demonstrating its value credentials with offers like 'Dine in for \u00a310', adding: 'We are confident customers will still want to treat themselves this Christmas.' </p> <p>He said 'no decision' had been taken on whether to roll out branded goods to all stores. The retailer broke with tradition in July by introducing hundreds of products like Fairy Liquid and Tetley tea in 19 stores. One supplier said the trial had hit targets but that there was 'internal politicking' as to whether it should become policy.</p>",
  "<p>They are forever inventing new ways of making the same thing a bit more exciting. In rugby union, just at the moment, we have a new set of laws and a Bledisloe Cup match staged in Hong Kong. There are new coaching regimes in England and Ireland gearing up for autumn internationals against the same old opposition, a nearly new one in Wales spicing things up with an ages-old argument over player release, and there is a Scot who has been nominated for best player in the world. </p> <p>Effortlessly rising above the need to be radical and new, though, is one of the oldest, most fail-safe enterprises in the sport. There is a Lions tour at the end of this season. </p> <p>This year's series of autumn internationals launched itself with yesterday's groundbreaking Test in Hong Kong and, in a no-doubt-riveting development, all the games over the next month will, for the first time, go towards determining the seedings for the 2011 World Cup. But it is South Africa and 2009 that will really dominate the thinking between now and June. </p> <p>That is just for those of us watching. For those playing, the incentive for 2009 will loom far larger than that for 2011. 'Playing for your country is certainly something you dream about as a young player,' says Jason Robinson, who knows how good life can get as an international as well as how high - and low - as a Lion. 'But the Lions takes it up another couple of notches. It's something that not many players ever get to do. I was just reminiscing with Brian [O'Driscoll] about our tours together. Although we can't say we've had a series win, we've got such great memories.' </p> <p>Those tours are the past two - in 2001 to Australia and 2005 to New Zealand. Same result - a series loss - but contrasting experiences. On the first, Robinson and O'Driscoll announced themselves properly to an admiring union world with dazzling tries in a first Test win as emphatic as any by a Lions team. Then, somehow, from half-time in a second Test they were dominating, the Lions surrendered the series to the world champion Wallabies. </p> <p>'That was very much the one that got away,' O'Driscoll says. 'We had Australia in that second Test, but there was a pivotal moment after half-time with their intercept try. It was one of those that if you could play it all again you would.' </p> <p>Robinson and O'Driscoll were reunited on the playing fields of Terenure College in Dublin, where they were launching the Irish leg of the HSBC Rugby Festivals. For Robinson, the thunder of a playing career has now passed, and he is enjoying more stately progress as an ambassador and coach, surrounded here by adoring children. O'Driscoll is no less the subject of hero worship, but his day job is still at the sharp end. He is among the many players, superstars and coming men alike, jostling for a place on the plane to South Africa, where the Lions last won a series in 1997. </p> <p>Declan Kidney, Ireland's new coach, has renamed him captain, despite the widely held expectation that he would be relieved of the task so as to concentrate on his form. O'Driscoll is more than comfortable to be handling the extra responsibility and reserves some scorn for those who think it affects his game. 'That is nonsense,' he says. 'It would mean that I played better in the first three or four years of my career than I have done in the last five or six, which would be an incredible generalisation. People, particularly in the media, put tags on you. One person says one thing and everyone else jumps on the bandwagon. I don't buy into it. You're your own best judge and I wouldn't say the captaincy has affected me at all.' </p> <p>O'Driscoll is one of a tiny elite to have captained a Lions tour and must be in the running to captain this next one, which would elevate him into an even tinier elite to have done it twice. It currently consists of Martin Johnson. 'I'm sure I'd be up for it if asked,' he says. 'Not because of any unfinished business. It's a huge honour, pure and simple.' </p> <p>The allusion to unfinished business refers to the last Lions tour to New Zealand, a thoroughly miserable affair that Robinson and O'Driscoll remember with a wince. O'Driscoll, the captain, was carried off, out of the tour, in the early minutes of the first Test, his shoulder dislocated in a controversial spear tackle. And the Lions were humiliated. </p> <p>If ever there were a case of inventing new ways to make the same thing slightly different, it was Sir Clive Woodward's bloated, too-clever-by-half enterprise in 2005. A vast touring party, many of whom had been picked on the back of their form two years earlier, two separate coaching panels, the Prime Minister's former spin doctor - it amounted to an invitation to hosts who don't need one to mete out punishment to the overblown and self-satisfied. </p> <p>It was a tour that went away from the timeless little things that breed spirit and adventure, such as rooming together. Robinson and O'Driscoll were room-mates for some of the 2001 tour. Robinson tells hysterical tales of rooming with Rob Henderson on the same tour - tales that tourists of any level would recognise of a chain-smoking, room-service-ordering, late-night-TV-watching heavy snorer. Not ideal big-match preparation, certainly, but the sort of thing an international superstar still enjoys reminiscing over. Neither Robinson nor O'Driscoll reminisce a lot about 2005. </p> <p>There is a feeling that there will be a return to basics for the 2009 version. Ian McGeechan embodies the spirit of the tried and trusted, and no one expects too much deviation from the formula that has brought him unparalleled success as a Lions coach in the past. </p> <p>Form is the most important criterion, according to Robinson. 'Unless you are playing well, you shouldn't go, no matter what your reputation, which is maybe one of the lessons to take from 2005. Brian knows he will have to be playing well in these autumn internationals and in the Six Nations in order to be in with a shout. And that's how it should be.' </p> <p>Which brings us on to the troubling state of England. They have found a clever new way of bypassing the argument between club and country, but it has come at a cost - the squad must be picked months in advance, so that it is inevitably out of date by the time the action starts. 'You want your strongest team on the field. The England management, though, have to make a call before a ball's been kicked, and that's not ideal,' Robinson says. 'The system is at fault. In order for England to progress we need to be picking people on form and that can change on a weekly basis. It's worst for the guys who are playing well, but can't be picked. My heart goes out to them.' </p> <p>Does it go out to his former comrade in arms, Johnson, who has been lumbered with this system as his starting point in a job he has never tried before at any level? 'Short-term, it's going to be hard for him. I'm sure he's going to have to take a lot of stick this autumn. It's certainly not a job I would want, but the important thing is that he obviously believes he can do something. We know all about his character, but this is unknown territory for him and he couldn't have asked for a tougher programme.' </p> <p>Indeed. The southern-hemisphere giants are coming. And the global row about the ELVs is sure to lurch into another phase as north and south collide under whichever of the laws happen to be applicable this month. </p> <p>O'Driscoll has enjoyed his rugby this season under the ELVs, displaying some of his best form in the recent round of Heineken Cup matches. Interestingly, he thinks the English referees, lambasted by many for enforcing the IRB directives at the breakdown so severely, are the ones doing their job properly. And he laments the loss of the maul. 'To me it's a skill and an art form. It is not a tool that we at Leinster used much, but other teams, like Leicester and Munster, considered themselves masters at it. To have it simply removed seems unjust.' </p> <p>He has no idea, though, whether the south will be disadvantaged when they come up here to play under our particular version of ELVs. 'I watch very little Super 14,' he says, 'and next to no Tri Nations, so I don't know how they were refereeing it. Their rucks, though, seem even more farcical than ours. I think that free-kick rule is a joke, and I'm glad it hasn't been brought up here. At least not yet.' </p> <p>But let us leave the IRB to worry about their precious ELVs and World Cup seedings. Hong Kong may have been an unlikely launch pad, but the autumn series is now under way, and the rest of us have simpler, more traditional pleasures. It is time to pick our Lions teams and argue about them. And then to do it again next week, and the next, and so on, right up until the first whistle in Durban.</p>"
