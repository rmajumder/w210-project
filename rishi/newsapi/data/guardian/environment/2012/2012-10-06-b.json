  "<p>Drones will be commonplace in the skies above the UK within a decade, according to a European commission document suggesting that hundreds of firms will develop new uses for them.</p> <p>But the claims have prompted concerns from civil liberties groups, who fear that the unmanned aircraft will result in more forms of surveillance. Some 95% of drones in operation are used by the military, but the document notes they now also have \"great potential for civil applications\".</p> <p>The commission's working paper, <a href=\"http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/12/st13/st13438.en12.pdf\" title=\"\">Towards a European Strategy for the Development of Civil Applications of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems</a>, claims there are some 400 civilian drone applications in development across the EU. This number is expected to rise in the next decade.</p> <p>It is estimated that 35,000 drones will be produced worldwide in the next 10 years. Currently the US and Israel produce two-thirds of drones, while Europe produces fewer than 10%.</p> <p>So far, non-military drone use is rare. Merseyside police bought a \u00a313,000 drone that crashed into the Mersey last year. Kent police are also reportedly working on a \u00a33m\u2009project to use unmanned aircraft to patrol the coast.</p> <p>Possible uses of civilian drones cited in the commission document include using them for \"risky flights into ash clouds or in proximity of nuclear or chemical plants after major incidents\". It also suggests drones could be used in crisis management, law enforcement, border control and firefighting.</p> <p>In commerce hundreds of uses have been identified \"in precision agriculture and fisheries, power/gas line monitoring, infrastructure inspection, communications and broadcasting, wireless communication relay and satellite augmentation systems, natural resources monitoring, media/entertainment, digital mapping, land and wildlife management, air quality management\". The paper says knowledge of drones' abilities \"will quickly spread among potential users, creating new markets of aerial services in the same way that the iPad created an entirely new and unpredicted market for mobile data services\".</p> <p>But campaigners warned that the new generation of drones could have profound consequences for civil liberties. \"With the use of drones in European airspace spiralling, we urgently need greater clarity and transparency about when and how these tools are deployed,\" said Eric King of Privacy International.</p> <p>\"Not too long ago, this was the stuff of science fiction, but flying robotic devices equipped with facial recognition technology and mobile phone interception kit are increasingly commonplace.</p> <p>\"However, the secretive way in which surveillance drones have been put into operation, and the failure of the police to recognise and address the human rights issues involved, has created a huge potential for abuse.\"</p> <p>The rush to develop the technology has also brought safety concerns. A report by the US government accountability office warns that Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) lack the technological and operational standards \"needed to guide safe and consistent performance of UAS\".</p> <p>The US government accountability office also acknowledged that there were privacy concerns including \"the potential for increased amounts of government surveillance using technologies placed on UAS, the collection and use of such data, and potential violations of constitutional Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizures\".The EC document urges member states to develop a common, comprehensive plan, similar to the regulatory strategy being rolled out in the US, to ensure drones become a common part of air traffic by 2016.</p> <p>\"The UK doesn't have a proper road map [for the roll out of drones]; its existing roadmap was written in 2005 and it's too old,\" said Mahendran Arjunraja, senior research analyst at Frost &amp; Sullivan, a global market consultancy. \"Safety issues are paramount. We will soon have civilian UAVs sharing airspace with airplanes,\" Arjunraja said. \"There is a need to develop sense-and-avoid technology so the UAS don't crash into aeroplanes. We should see this technology being rolled out within the next 10 years.\"</p>",
  "<p>There is no doubt that the row over a group of tiny islands in the East China Sea has sealed the deterioration in relations between China and Japan. The diplomatic spat over the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, which sparked violent protests, with Japanese flags and factories burned, stunned Tokyo, and caused Japanese companies to consider scrapping investment plans in China. Why open a new factory, they ask, just for it to be firebombed or defaced while an acquiescent administration turns a blind eye?</p> <p>Until recently the \"one-plus-one\" investment policy (for every factory built in Japan, companies also had to build one overseas) benefited China. But now insiders say firms will look to support growth in Indonesia, the Philippines or newly open Burma.</p> <p>For the International Monetary Fund, which has taken its annual meeting to the Japanese capital for the first time since 1964, the dispute is one of many linked to slowing growth and a rise in protectionism.</p> <p>This week's meeting was scheduled for Cairo, until the Arab spring made the region look too unstable for a gathering of finance ministers and global institutions. But with Chinese frigates circling the disputed islands and pleas for calm going unheeded, Tokyo's political situation is closer to Cairo's than the IMF expected.</p> <p>China's leaders are undoubtedly under pressure. Growth has slowed from more than 10% to less than 8% over the past two years, but its rising population means that growth of between 6% and 7% is needed just to keep pace. In March, Beijing cut its growth target for the whole of 2012 to 7.5%. As any student of politics knows, a foreign dispute distracts attention from failing economic policies.</p> <p>But opting for a short-term boost in domestic popularity over a deterioration in long-term relations with foreign investors looks to be a huge mistake by the Beijing authorities. And the IMF understands that this local dispute has much wider ramifications: after all, Japan is the world's third-largest economy and China, its second-biggest, accounts for about a fifth of the world's total economic output. Any slowdown is going to hamper a global recovery.</p> <p>The Americans have already put the brakes on expansion in China, in reaction to general corruption and to the growing threat from intellectual property theft. European companies have also backed off, preferring to send in high-value goods made at home.</p> <p>Japan's economy is not in great shape either. This year, colossal spending on imported gas and oil will send the balance of payments into reverse for only the second time in three decades. The yen is at a historic high against the dollar, making Japanese products expensive abroad, and the political situation remains unstable, with the Democratic party government able to push through a VAT rise only on a promise of early elections.</p> <p>And let's not forget the eurozone crisis. That continues to provide plenty of food for thought for IMF officials, given the failure to deal with Spain's financial black hole and growing public unrest among southern Europe's increasingly desperate citizens.</p> <p>Yet it is the Japan/China dispute that is worrying them most. Japan believes the Chinese are wilfully making trouble: it has stressed that it bought the islands earlier this year to keep them out of the hands of the mayor of Tokyo, a Boris Johnson-style character with a populist enmity towards the Chinese community in Japan.</p> <p>Maybe Beijing thinks it can go it alone without Japanese investment. It would be wrong, and the decision could have implications for us all.</p> <h2>Have women had their quota of being kept down?</h2> <p>What does it take to get more women into the boardroom? Compulsory quotas? This is always presented as the nuclear option and women who have managed to bust through the glass ceiling are by and large against them.</p> <p>Last week, announcing her decision to leave <em>Financial Times</em> owner Pearson after 15 years in charge, Dame Marjorie Scardino said: \"I thought, in 1997, that by the time I left Pearson, things would be different in terms of the number of chief executives and board members who are women. It's not really too different and, for that, I'm sorry.\"</p> <p>It had been hoped that Scardino, the first woman to run a FTSE 100 company, would be the first of many, but there have never been more than five female FTSE 100 bosses at any one time. Yet Scardino rejected quotas: \"You should choose people on the basis of their abilities. Not on the basis of things they can't do anything about.\"</p> <p>But doesn't the under-representation of women in the City \u2013 they still occupy fewer than one in five FTSE 100 boardroom seats \u2013 suggest their \"abilities\" are being overlooked?</p> <p>Last year, a government inquiry led by Lord Davies of Abersoch set a target of 25% female representation on FTSE boards by 2015. Companies were told to act or face eventual quotas. There was a flurry of appointments of women to FTSE boards, but a worrying proportion of them were in part-time, non-executive roles.</p> <p>Last month Royal Mail's Canadian boss, Moya Greene, told a conference that the pace of change in this country was \"glacial\". When she started in the Canadian civil service, no woman taking a senior role could be married. Progress came thanks to quotas. \"Unless you have quotas and live by them,\" she said, \"you won't see change.\"</p> <p>Strong stuff. But the government is fighting an EU move to impose a 40% female quota for large company boards, arguing that national schemes should be given a chance. At what point should women start to lose patience? After all, 15 years is a long time.</p> <h2>For BAE and EADS, two into three won't go</h2> <p>So much for Tom Enders's and Ian King's vision that an EADS/BAE Systems combo would be a depoliticised company. For the past week, all the debate has been about how great a slice of the shares the French and German governments will retain, or at least control. \"A lot\" seems to be the short answer \u2013 maybe 9% each. By contrast, it is envisaged that the UK would rub along with only a golden share to protect national security and act as a veto on a change of control. Former chancellor Alistair Darling doesn't like the smell of it.</p> <p>\"We will be taken to the cleaners,\" he told the <em>FT</em>. \"I don't see how you could have a large new company like this with the French and German governments having large direct and indirect stakes and we have none.\"</p> <p>Darling is right. It is relatively easy to accept that BAE, in the face of shrinking defence budgets, needs to do something. The logic of a grand European defence-and-aerospace company is also sound. But a three-way alliance will work only if all three sponsoring governments have equal standing. Any other arrangement invites years of squabbling over jobs and investment and accusations of political interference. The two chief executives want a business that operates \"in a normal commercial manner and which confers the same rights on all shareholders, large and small\". That won't happen if two governments, but not the third, have large shareholdings.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>There is a saying: \"If it's not broke, don't fix it,\" and that certainly applies to the reduction of funds for British Antarctic science, and submerging the significance of a first-rate science group, the British Antarctic Survey (\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/29/british-antarctic-survey-cuts-merger\" title=\"\">Preserving the spirit of Shackleton: why the UK must treasure its polar research</a>\", News).</p> <p>It is foolish to apply across-the-board cuts to \"solve\" a budget crisis. It would make far more sense to protect and nourish the British institutions that are performing very well on the world stage, while cutting more deeply into those subjects that are performing less well, or are just mediocre in importance (do we really need a state-funded popular music radio channel?).</p> <p><strong>Thomas Crowley </strong></p> <p>Formerly of the US National Science Foundation</p> <p>East Linton</p> <p>East Lothian</p> <p>Robin McKie reports that British polar research is under threat as a result of the proposed merger of the National Oceanography Centre and the British Antarctic Survey. This proposal will be considered by the Council of the Natural Environment Research Council in December following an open consultation. Far from posing a threat to polar research, we are continuing to sustain our polar activity, and its role in maintaining the UK presence in Antarctica and South Georgia, in spite of the pressure on science budgets that our present circumstances demand.</p> <p>Our aim in proposing the merger of the BAS and the National Oceanography Centre is to create a single institute that can take on the largest grand challenges of polar science, north and south, and that can make the most effective use of the combined fleet. We are considering matching the centre's ambition with a new name, but there are no plans to close BAS at Cambridge, whose existence remains integral to the new centre's ambition.</p> <p><strong>Duncan Wingham </strong></p> <p>Chief Executive, Natural Environment Research Council</p> <p>Swindon</p> <h2><strong>1962 \u2013 a good year for cricket</strong><br></h2> <p>I celebrated my first teenage birthday in October 1962 so your tales resonate strongly with me (\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/sep/29/october-1962-modern-culture?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">October 1962: the month that modern culture was born</a>\", In Focus).

These must have been from Kentucky Fried Chicken, before the initialism was coined to save the obese time, because this wasn't recent. So maybe there were Wimpy burgers involved as well. And battered saveloys. And gloopy psychedelic sweet and sour chicken. Some senior civil servants must have been weaned on MSG.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/03/transport-secretary-west-coast-mainline\" title=\"\">three DfT officials were suspended</a> for getting the maths wrong when awarding the new west coast mainline contract. On the same day, a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5ibDGZCWWRp7xcFf8MWRm1bG6Uz7g?docId=N0023921349285680612A\" title=\"\">study</a> was published which claimed to show a link between eating a lot of fast food during childhood and growing up with a lower IQ. And that, before you point out the obvious flaw, is once they've already taken into account the effect of being born into the sort of socio-educationo-economic environment where eating chips for roughage is the norm. Even when contextually adjusted, this study seemed to show that consuming crap is actively enthickifying. It's a thickener, like flour. Hamburgers, it seems, increase density as well as mass.</p> <p>But at least it's not affecting these poor kids' chances of careers in the civil service \u2013 not if the Department for Transport is anything to go by. However badly Britain's children have been failed by the Departments of Health and for Education (their annoying prepositions, not mine), Transport will absorb the problem, enveloping all those malnourished thickos like a warm naan.</p> <p>I don't completely understand what the civil servants got wrong \u2013 but then I ate a lot of fish and chips in the late 70s. And, in my defence, neither did the ministers in charge. In fact, not only did they not understand, according to No 10, they couldn't be expected to. Apparently these were \"highly technical\" errors. Errors that you have to be massively in the know to be able to make. The idiots who made them were very well-informed \u2013 you'd have to be a latter-day Brunel just to see where they'd gone wrong. At the very least, you'd have to know how to build your own train, I reckon. The poor secretaries of state couldn't have spotted the mistake any more than the health secretary would be able to troubleshoot a botched bit of brain surgery. Like homeopaths in the face of someone who's actually ill, they were powerless.</p> <p>It was to do with \"mistakes in the way in which inflation and passenger numbers were taken into account\". Exactly. It's basically gibberish. Crazy techy, Ivor the Engine stuff. Something to do with pistons or the chemical composition of crash barriers, I expect. Or that sort of traffic-managing computer which Benny Hill hacked into in <em>The Italian Job</em>. It's a sequence of words our politicians shouldn't be expected to comprehend \u2013 even those posh ones we've got at the moment who I'm sure had plenty of fresh veg in their youth.</p> <p>To be honest, I was quite pleased by this blunder. When the contract was originally awarded to FirstGroup, I thought there might be something nasty going on. I so dislike that company \u2013 largely from my experience of one of its existing franchises, First Great Western, which smugly occupies Brunel's line, has appropriated two-thirds of its historic name and doesn't have Wi-Fi. Its American corporate exploitation of British heritage infrastructure deeply offends me \u2013 they're flogging an overpriced George Stephenson-themed microwavable burrito in our nation's buffet car. Metaphorically speaking. (Though it's probably just a matter of time.) This lot, I thought, are exactly the sort to have nobbled the whole process \u2013 to have lobbied the shit out of the taxpayer and passengers' interests \u2013 while poor Richard Branson is Phileas Fogging around, appearing in his own adverts. So to find out it's cock-up, not conspiracy, is very heartening and a good sign about our society in general.</p> <p>We're so quick, particularly in the age of the internet, to look for intricate, dark and corrupt explanations. I suppose we look at our iPhones and laptops, at computer-generated imagery and GPS mapping technology, and assume ourselves to be in the midst of a maelstrom of cleverness. Things that seem to go wrong, we therefore assume, are a result of cleverness evilly directed. But this report on junk food tells a different story.</p> <p>There is incompetence everywhere. Who, reading this, can honestly say that they haven't been met with some maddening instance of idiotic, mulish, obstructive behaviour in the last week, while trying to deal with a large company or an organ of the state or a car park machine or a postal sorting office or a cafe that refuses to put tea bags actually into the water or a minicab driver who's never seen a traffic jam before? If you haven't experienced any, the chances are you've caused some. In all likelihood, most of us have done both.</p> <p>The world is packed with stupidity. Some may think the news about junk food depressing our IQs is a dietary time bomb. I reckon it's already gone off. We're not a thoughtful, engaged people; our ruminations are no longer metaphorical. We're not chewing anything over, we're just chewing.</p> <p>But this could be good news. The paradox about unhealthy eating has always been that it initially makes you feel good \u2013 it's satisfying, comforting and basically delicious \u2013 but in the long run it makes us feel bad. It makes our bodies huge and unwieldy, our guts sluggish and unpredictable, our hearts exhausted and clogged. Our under-evolved metabolisms send the brain the wrong messages about these substances \u2013 it wrongly classifies them as friendly. Or so we thought. But maybe the brain knows better. It can feel its own acuity, its ability to question, doubt, analyse, imagine, worry, fear and ceaselessly sense its own mortality, being blunted \u2013 in starchy, sugary stupidity lies its chance of contentment.</p> <p>I, for one, welcome this development. The recent events at the DfT are a sign of what we can look forward to. We may be moving into a simpler age for Britain and the west, a time of plodding, uncomprehending enjoyment of technology manufactured for us in the far east which we lack the skills even to mend; a time when the bitterness and intrigue of our political system seeps away to be replaced by bumbling ineptitude, a harmless villagey stupidity brought on by a comforting diet of sugar and crisps. We won't live so long \u2013 but then again we won't be able to count so high, so our lifespans will probably feel about the same. Everything else will feel different, blurrier, better.

  "<p>Deep in the forest of Gribskov, some of the leaves are starting to flush with their autumnal colours. It makes the stand of blighted trees all the more obvious.</p> <p>Seven or eight 20m-high sticks, stripped of their greenery, are all that is left of a group of ash trees. \"It's very ugly and very sad,\" said Ditte Christina Olrik, a scientist with the Danish government's Nature Agency. \"The fungus is very, very small, like pinheads, on the leaf stalks. When the leaves die and fall, the wind carries them on to the next&#xa0;tree.\"</p> <p>The little killer that has affected almost all of Denmark's ash trees, and has stealthily destroyed ash in Germany, Poland, Norway, Sweden and Austria has a big name \u2013 <em>Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus</em>, an anamorph of <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>. For those who enjoy a walk in the woods without a Latin degree, it's ash dieback.</p> <p>The Danes, along with people in other European countries who have watched this fungus destroy their trees with a force not seen since the Dutch elm disease epidemic, have been urging Britain to ban imports of ash saplings to keep forests here quarantined.</p> <p>Last week the UK government launched a consultation that ends on 26 October and could lead to an interim import ban by November. But what the environment minister announced as \"timely\" action might in fact be far too late.</p> <p>In February, the fungus was found in a batch of trees sent from a Dutch nursery to Buckinghamshire. Between June and September it was confirmed in nurseries in Yorkshire, Surrey and Cambridgeshire, at a Forestry Commission Scotland woodland near Kilmacolm, and in ash trees planted in a Leicester car park. Conservationists hope it has not reached the 80 million ash trees in the wider British countryside, outside of new plantings.</p> <p>In Denmark 90% of their ash has been affected, their third most common tree species after oak and beech and a crucial export for the timber industry, and expect that to rise.</p> <p>In the state-owned forest in Zealand, north of Copenhagen, forest pathologist Iben Margrete Thomsen says their hope is that around 1% of ash in Denmark may prove resistant and survive.</p> <p>Passing a stand of balding trees, she points out one that still has a normal leaf cover \u2013 \"but, of course, we don't know if that is truly a resistant tree or one that will be affected very soon. In the end, though, only the few ash trees which are not susceptible to the fungus will be left.</p> <p>\"At first it was only the younger trees, and then we started to see it in the older trees too. Now I can see it everywhere. The fungus itself doesn't immediately kill the tree, but if you think of it acting a little like the HIV virus it weakens the immune system and allows some other disease to come in. It is the secondary disease that will finish the tree off.</p> <p>\"We have not seen anything on this scale since Dutch elm disease. Fungus is meant to kill trees, otherwise a tree would never die, but this escalation is something we have not seen. The UK and Ireland may well be, within the next 10 years, the only remaining places in Europe with ash. If they act.</p> <p>\"The rest of Europe wants the UK to act. They are saying 'get a ban' because they have seen what this disease can do. But whether or not it's too late?\" She shrugged. \"It may be a case of shutting the stable door when the horse has bolted. Time will tell.\"</p> <p>Outside of the forests, ash was used in towns and cities too, to replace many of the urban trees Denmark lost to Dutch elm disease.</p> <p>On Sonde Boulevard in the capital, Copenhagen, Lars Christensen is among a team of horticulturalists responsible for the city's landscaping. They, too, have seen ash dieback and here on this street have come up with their response: variation. Along the street that runs through a residential area are planted almost a dozen different species of young trees.</p> <p>\"It's about rethinking the two rows of identical trees in cities. It's simple, but surprisingly difficult to convince people that we cannot be reliant on one tree species, no matter how much people like them,\" he said.</p> <p>City trees have a tough time. Root restriction, pollution, salt and dog urine mean they have a life expectancy that is half that of a fellow forest tree. But constantly cutting down and replanting diseased trees is costly and last year Copenhagen brought in a 10% rule. \"Every tree we plant we have to check how many of that species is in an area already,\" explained Christensen, showing a great list of statistics for the city's areas. \"If, say, we already have 10% or more of ash then we have to plant lime or willow or whatever.\"</p> <p>But even if the city's busy residents will be protected from the sudden loss of their trees, the ash will be badly missed.</p> <p>In the national forest at Gribskov, Olrik points out an ash that has been cut down, how the beautiful light-coloured wood that makes ash so popular for furniture and other uses is discoloured and blotched.</p> <p>The tree trunk has an alien look, covered with unnatural-looking, thin green sprouts coming through the bark. \"The tree panics when the leaves die, so to try to stay alive, it pushes out lots of these things. It's one of the signs.</p> <p>\"Seventy years of growth and now good for firewood only,\" sighs Olrik. \"We cut this tree to show your UK Forestry Commission when they came here to have a look last week. They were very shocked.</p> <p>\"It's shocking. We are used to seeing ash dieback now, but it's still hard to think we are losing the ash tree. Not just economically, not just because it supports a unique and complex ecosystem that we will also lose, but it's such a traditional tree for Denmark; the tree of life it's called.</p> <p>\"You see many houses that will have a huge ash tree outside. It was supposed to protect the home from fire. Every Danish child knows a story about the ash tree, it is very important in mythology, and their death represents chaos.</p> <p>\"So now they are dying, some people are wondering, what does it mean? What is the future?\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 8 November. The headline and main text said that 90% of trees in Denmark had been killed. This is incorrect and has been changed to \"affected\". </p>",

Its London director, Kadee Robbins, said the move reflected that the capital has \"a very wealthy, very savvy international community\" of collectors.</p> <p>As the gallerists feared in 2010, when<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/12/mega-galleries-global-art-market\" title=\"\"> Pace announced its intention to expand into London</a> and Hauser &amp; Wirth opened a new gallery in Savile Row, the established London galleries selling contemporary art now face a big challenge from foreign rivals on their own doorstep.</p> <p>Judd Tully, a New York-based writer for <em>Art+Auction</em> magazine, said: \"Essentially, what the richer galleries are doing is establishing new beachheads in London to find new collectors from Russia, Asia and the Middle East who are more comfortable there than in New York.\"</p> <p>Nearly a third of London's 5,955 inhabitants who have a net worth of more than $30m (\u00a318.5m) are non-doms, according to Wealth-X, a company that compiles data on the super-rich. Billionaire art collectors with homes in the capital include Lakshmi Mittal (net worth: \u00a39.8bn), Roman Abramovich (\u00a37.5bn) and Victor Pinchuk (\u00a32.6bn).</p> <p>Tully said the globalisation of the art market meant that New York galleries were no longer as likely to limit their expansion to the west coast of America. Big-name artists now want a global audience for their work and would jump ship to rival galleries to gain it.</p> <p>He added that major US galleries also hoped to emulate the success of Larry Gagosian, considered the most powerful art dealer in the world, who has 12 galleries worldwide, including two in London. Pace has seven locations worldwide, including a space in Beijing, while Werner also has two galleries in Germany and one in New York.</p> <p>Tully said: \"Dealers don't want to lose artists because another dealer has opened a gallery in London. It's a major threat to Zwirner; he absolutely needs to expand to Europe because of the danger of his artists being poached. He's not lost an artist to another dealer except Franz West to Gagosian. Pace is a much older blue-chip gallery, but they're also forced to open [in London] because Gagosian would eat up a bunch of their artists.\"</p> <p>Gagosian's latest addition is a 17,760 sq&#xa0;ft space in a former factory redesigned by French \"starchitect\" Jean Nouvel in Le Bourget near Paris. It opens this month with an exhibition by Anselm Kiefer \u2013 in competition with Austrian dealer Thaddaeus Ropac, who announced six months earlier that his new gallery would open at the same time with a show by the German painter and sculptor.</p> <p>Several of the artists whom Zwirner represents, including Marlene Dumas and Chris Ofili, already have London galleries. Its London director, Angela Choon, said they will respect the relationships those artists already have with London galleries and focus on exhibiting other artists. Their opening exhibition is new work by Luc Tuymans, who has not shown in London since 2004.</p> <p>Michael Werner opens with an exhibition of new paintings by Peter Doig, who is already represented here by Victoria Miro. Kadee Robbins said: \"I hope we just leave it to the artists to see the best resolution for them.\"</p> <p>New York-based art adviser Wendy Cromwell predicted that some of the larger London galleries may be upgrading their real estate. \"The art world has become very event driven. There's a certain class of collector whom these galleries are going after who like to be seen at openings, at the Frieze Art Fair, who think bigger is better and more is more,\" she said.</p> <p>Tully added: \"It will be good for the London market to wake up, because the Americans are invading.\"</p> <p>Several London galleries have recently moved to bigger spaces. Blain Southern is moving this week from Dering Street to a larger Mayfair space on Hanover Square. The not-for-profit David Roberts Art Foundation last month opened its new 12,000 sq ft space in Camden.</p> <p>However, smaller Modern and impressionist galleries, such as those already under threat from two major property redevelopments on Cork Street, could find themselves squeezed as the competition among contemporary galleries intensifies.</p> <p>Bernard Jacobson, whose eponymous gallery is one of the 11 under threat on the Mayfair street, said the developers' heads had been turned by the US galleries and that they planned to build fewer but larger art spaces in an attempt to attract big names. \"They think they're going to sell 10,000 sq ft units to the likes of the Gagosian.\"</p> <p>Cromwell said: \"I could see them being forced out. Few if any of those galleries have street-level space in New York and what's happened here is really an indication of what is happening in London.\"</p> <p>Harry Blain, co-owner of Blain Southern, who is considered one of Britain's most powerful art dealers, said the New York galleries' London expansion would enhance the city's reputation as a global art destination.</p> <p>Curator and academic Andrew Renton, the director of Marlborough Contemporary, a new gallery opened on the second floor of long-established Marlborough Fine Art in Mayfair, said: \"It confirms where we are as the central location in the world for contemporary and modern art. London has had a dynamic art scene for 20 years, but not necessarily a dynamic art market. Now we've got both.\"<br></p>",
  "<p><strong>The blindingly obvious inference of the </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/21/drugs-industry-scandal-ben-goldacre\" title=\"\"><strong>extract from your book</strong></a><strong> published in the <em>Guardian</em>\u2013 as of so many others you once commendably wrote in your </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/series/badscience\" title=\"\"><strong>Bad Science column</strong></a><strong> \u2013 is that this is an industry totally unsuited to being run on profit-maximising lines by conventional shareholder companies. Given that, and the tremendous level of subsidy the industry already receives from governments around the world, why not spell out the vital necessity of locating it within publicly owned/non-profit organisations where there need be no obstacle to full transparency?</strong></p> <p><strong>Harry Shutt, via email</strong></p> <p>I am a realist about this. I don't want a central-command state economy. In general, drug companies are reasonably good at developing new treatments and there's also a lot of good in the industry. The point of my book is that it's possible for good people in badly designed systems to perpetrate acts of great evil completely unthinkingly. I don't think any of the people I write about would punch an old lady in the face, but they would inflict the same level of harm when they are abstracted away from the outcomes of their actions.</p> <p>This is made easier, I think, because in general, most drugs do work better than nothing: it's just that we may be misled into using, for example, an expensive new drug where an older, cheaper one is more effective.</p> <p>Overall, the problem is we don't have a competent regulatory framework that prevents things from going horribly wrong. If companies are allowed to hide the results of clinical trials then they will, and that will distort clinical practice. Doctors and patients will be misled and make sub-optimal decisions about what treatment is best for them.</p> <p>Similarly, if you can get on to the market by making a me-too copycat drug that represents little or no therapeutic advance and is even less effective than the drugs that it copies, then you will. And you can get such a drug to the market because regulators approve new treatments even when they've only been shown only to be better than placebo\u2026</p> <p><strong>The Observer: Rather than the best current treatment available?</strong></p> <p>Exactly. When that happens, then there's less drive to innovate new medicines. So a lot of people think they know how you test a new drug, they think it's a placebo-controlled randomised trial, and that's kind of true. However, for most situations we already have some kind of treatment, so we're not interested in whether your treatment is better than nothing; we're interested in whether it's better than what we're already using. But you can get on to the market without ever comparing your drug against the best currently available treatment, and then you can bamboozle doctors and patients into using it by distorting the clinical evidence with all the tricks I describe, and then by giving a biased picture of that distorted evidence to doctors and patients through your marketing activity. All of that means, crucially, you can turn a profit by producing drugs that aren't very innovative.</p> <p>So at the moment our regulatory frameworks do not represent a good set of incentives for innovation. When people say, \"Oh my God, it's dreadful all these companies have had to pull out of developing new drugs for Alzheimer's\", on the one hand Alzheimer's is a very difficult problem, on the other hand we haven't created a regulatory framework that sufficiently incentivises people to take serious risks, and research entirely new treatments.</p> <p><strong> I have been in healthcare marketing communications for more than 30 years (flogging drugs to doctors) and can confirm that much of the sharp practice you describe is caused by the pressure exerted on researchers by marketing departments. When a new drug entity makes it through Phase I, the pharmaceutical company's marketers carry out market research studies to find out what doctors expect and desire from such a product. The results of these studies are used to develop \"guidance\" for researchers designing Phase II and III trials. One issue is the speed with which some doctors (\"innovators\" in marketing speak) adopt new medicines. There is a drug surveillance system in this country that requires doctors to report all adverse events occurring in patients taking new drugs. So if doctors were a little less enthusiastic and prescribed new products to no more than a couple of patients at first, most problems would come to light before large numbers were affected.</strong></p> <p><strong>arghbee, via web</strong></p> <p>I agree, the world would be a better place if doctors were less enthusiastic about adopting very new drugs. When I was taught how to prescribe by my clinical pharmacology professors, as an undergraduate in medicine, we were told: don't prescribe new drugs unless they are spectacularly superior to what you already have; let other doctors take the chance. And that's what I teach students myself. Regard the whole of the rest of humanity as unpaid stunt doubles. Because, when you prescribe a new drug, often you are prescribing something that has only been tested in a few thousand people for a very short period of time, perhaps only six months, and that's not long enough to know whether there are any medium- or long-term side-effects. It's also too few recipients of the drug to find out about rarer side-effects. On top of that, when drugs come to market they've only often been shown to be effective on short-term outcomes, and on surrogate outcomes, weak outcomes, theoretical outcomes. So a new drug might have shown to affect a blood test result, which we hope is theoretically associated with a real-world outcome, but not tested against real-world outcomes such as pain, suffering and death. On top of that, while doctors and patients sometimes fetishise the new, the evidence is that overall, new drugs are often no better than the older ones they replace.</p> <p>If there is time for shared decision making, when we're prescribing a new drug, then I think first doctors could maybe say to their patients: \"The drug I'm prescribing has only been tested in a few thousand people for less than six months, and it's only been shown to improve blood tests, not the real outcomes in your disease. If you prefer, we also have a tablet that has been around for 10 years, has been taken by millions of people, and that we know has a positive impact on real-world long-term outcomes \u2013 which would you prefer?\" Because I think these are reasonable issues to factor in, when you're making a treatment decision.</p> <p><strong>Obs: And the point about marketing departments influencing trials?</strong></p> <p>This is a really interesting area and it's a good illustration of how there is good and bad in current marketing practices. I think it's really good that somebody out there listens to what doctors and patients want and need, in order to try to address those needs. There's a scandalously brief and interesting history of research on this question in academia. It was only very recently that people went out and formally asked patients: \"What's the most important outcome to you?\" The classic study was one in a rheumatology outpatients' clinic \u2013 they said: \"What kind of trials do you think need to be done?\" And the patients said: \"We don't think you need any more trials comparing one pill against another, we want trials to tell us if physiotherapy improves outcomes, because doing physio is a massive drag and requires a lot of effort from us.\" The other thing they said, to everybody's complete astonishment, was: \"We don't think that pain is the most important symptom, it's actually stiffness.\" And that amazed everyone. So good quality, systematic, mixed methods, qualitative and quantitative research, to find out this sort of stuff is really great and important.</p> <p><strong>Obs: Are pharma marketing departments doing that?</strong></p> <p>Well, they're probably doing some and a mix of other stuff. The real problems come when you look at the interplay between market research and the whole process of publication planning, which is something that many doctors and academics are completely unaware of. Certainly, I think, the public have very little knowledge of it. We all like to imagine that the academic literature is composed of worthy papers by independent academics exploring things on the basis of interest. We don't, for the most part, realise that there is often a hidden hand guiding this process. So when a new drug is being brought to market, especially one that addresses a problem that hasn't been addressed before, you will often get an elaborate sequence of covertly planned marketing activity in the academic literature, without any declaration that this is what's happening.</p> <p>For example, companies will set about paying for and planning, and in some cases ghostwriting, papers saying that the disease their new drug treats is an underdiagnosed problem, it's much more prevalent than we thought. You might also start to produce lots of literature about how current interventions aren't very good, downplay your own side effects, promote off-label uses of your drug, and so on. That's all before you get anywhere stage-managing the literature about the actual benefits of your treatments.</p> <p>So the interplay between marketing departments and research departments, I think, is inevitable. It's a mixture of good and bad, but the thing that's most striking is how ignorant most people are about these things, and how huffy and upset drug companies get when you start to talk about it. If people really think it's OK to have commercial medical writers writing papers instead of academics, then they should put their names clearly and proudly at the top of the papers. If people really think it's OK to stage-manage the whole programme of academic journal articles behind the scenes up to the launch of your drug, they should just mention that in the papers at the bottom: \"This is part of the programme leading up to the launching of drug X. The idea for this paper came from the marketing department at Y.\" If they think all this activity is OK, then that's fine: they should be happy to declare that publicly, and we can decide for ourselves.</p> <p><strong> In your book you appear to be describing situations where companies knowingly suppress information that shows the products they are selling are ineffective or worse. My doctorate is in engineering and if we had done that we would have been liable to a prosecution for fraud. This is quite irrespective of the regulations pertaining to a specific industry, though we were required to report any significant deviation to the regulator as soon as we were aware of it. So, quite simply, why are these pharmaceutical companies not being prosecuted?</strong></p> <p><strong>Joseph Cullen, via email</strong></p> <p>Well, it's a huge cultural blind spot. No one, with the exception of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine, which is a very small organisation, not one of the medical and academic bodies have stood up and said: \"Selectively withholding unflattering trial data is research misconduct, and the ultimate&#xa0;end product is a biased picture of the effectiveness of your intervention.\"</p> <p>If I deleted half the data points in one study to make my treatment look better than it really is, everybody would say that was research misconduct. But for some reason when I delete half of the trials from my clinical trials programme and only publish half of them, that is not regarded as research misconduct.</p> <p>It's a cultural blind spot that comes about, I think, because the misconduct arises from a slightly diffused network of failure. So in some cases there will be obsessive, evil people at the centre, with full panoramic knowledge of everything that's happening, stage managing it. In other cases, you'll have individuals in organisations, maybe quite junior, they've got a trial with a negative result, nobody's enthusiastic about putting it out there, and to that one researcher, not publishing a paper intuitively doesn't feel the same as deleting some data points in a study, even if the end product is the same, in terms of the impact on doctors' and patients' knowledge of the risks and benefits.</p> <p>That's why I think it's really disappointing that nobody, not the Royal Colleges, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the British Pharmacology Society, the British Medical Association, none of these organisations have stood up and said: selective non-publication of unflattering trial data is research misconduct, and if you do it you will be booted out. And I think they really urgently should.</p> <p>I have to say, for a lot of the things I cover in the book, I honestly believe this stuff has been protected from public scrutiny for many years by a wall of tedium, or if you like, by a wall of modest scientific complexity. It's behind closed doors but not locked doors, it's all hiding in plain sight. I think it's very likely that this will turn out to be like MPs' expenses or phone hacking journalists. The people involved in these small communities have all convinced one another that what they do is completely normal and fine. But it's not. I think that when the public come to see what has been going on, they might be appalled.</p> <p><strong> I work for an institutional shareholder of many large pharmaceutical companies. Do you think there are any pharmaceutical companies that stand out in terms of transparency of trial results? And at the other end of the scale, are there any companies that consistently fail to publish negative trials?</strong></p> <p><strong>Laura Foll, analyst, Henderson Global Investors</strong></p> <p>No. I have no reason to believe that any one is any better than the other. If you have bad regulations, incoherently enforced, then everybody does what they have to do, to succeed in the marketplace.</p> <p><strong> Considering we have to discuss and&#xa0;explain population-based risk to&#xa0;the individual we are treating, and the&#xa0;way we discuss risk biases the response, how do you discuss risk in simple terms, for example, in primary prevention?</strong></p> <p><strong>Tariq Hussain, GP</strong></p> <p>This is an amazingly interesting area, and I think it is the next horizon in medicine. If you put me in charge of the medical research budget I would cancel all primary research, I would cancel all new trials, for just one year, and I would spend the money exclusively on making sure that we make the best possible use of the clinical evidence that we already have. This means first devising better ways of communicating risk to patients, and engaging in a process of shared decision-making wherever appropriate. Second, I would put the money into a better information architecture for evidence-based medicine. I would put the money into researching and implementing better systems to get the right information to the right doctor at the right time, to collate and then to disseminate the information that we have.</p> <p><strong>Obs: We had quite a few questions from readers who, faced with difficult decisions about changing drugs or trying a new drug, were reading trials and studies themselves\u2026</strong></p> <p>That's a real mistake, actually. As&#xa0;I say in the book, I don't think it's a good idea for individuals to try to pick and choose their drugs, or stop their drugs. I think it's a very dangerous business. I don't say that because I want to protect any special status in the medical profession, I just think it takes a really long time to acquire the skills and knowledge to do that. People often say: \"What do I do for me? For my treatment decision&#xa0;right here and now?\" And the best advice I can ever give is to find a good doctor and talk to them about it, and anybody who tells you that they can give good advice about your medical problems in a newspaper&#xa0;article, or on the internet, or in some silly magazine, should be regarded with infinite suspicion, no matter how big a bouffant or how deep a perma-tan they have \u2013 I'm not thinking of anyone in particular, I don't really know that scene. I don't do&#xa0;readers' health advice and I think these things are best discussed with your doctor.</p> <p><strong>Patients often resort to saying: \"Doctor, if it were you, what would you do?\" Or \"If it were your child\u2026?\"</strong></p> <p>I think that's a reasonable question to ask. Often decision making is a complicated business, weighing lots of risks and benefits against one another, often it can't be operationalised. But I think the important thing is that doctors have all of the information that they need in order to make informed decisions. First, because it's not hidden from them, and second because it is competently disseminated to them, and patients should have the choice to engage with that, but there's nothing compulsory about it. I think data on how good your local school is should be available to you, but equally I recognise that the overwhelming majority of parents never look at it, and that's normal. I wouldn't judge them. I just think the information needs to be available.</p>",
  "<p>Aidan and Ed pop over for supper. It's the first time my kids have come over for a&#xa0;meal since Simon moved in. While he is busy in the kitchen, the boys and I chat, download a new album and discuss the merits of having a dog.

  "<p>Here's the thing, as Robert Peston compulsively remarks online, on air and in print: how come many acclaimed experts \u2013 Gordon Brown, Alan Greenspan, Hank Paulson, Fred the Shred and Merv the Swerve \u2013 got it so calamitously wrong? How come they were all credit-crunched in 2008 and 2009? Even Peston wasn't infallible. He could see desolation arriving but not to a precise schedule, not so that he could raise his voice in BBC editorial meetings and demand a special timber-shivering spot on <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/default.stm\" title=\"\"><em>Today</em></a>. This mess caught everyone flat-footed \u2013 and by far the best half of his book is explaining how and why.</p> <p>Peston, to be fair, did know that something was drastically wrong. He got his famous Northern Rock scoop because he'd spotted that the Rock \u2013 overleveraged, overborrowed, overconfident that the good times would roll on for ever \u2013 was patently vulnerable once confidence wobbled. He was waiting for the Bank of England to lurch to the rescue: his exclusive was rooted in analysis. But he's utterly right \u2013 here's another thing! \u2013 to turn some of his fire on journalists themselves, on the dogs that&#xa0;didn't bark.</p> <p>Begin with newspaper editors who \"rarely knew much about business and the economy and couldn't have cared less\" about the continuing yarn of who was up or down on the stock market that day. Ask where, apart from the very specialist press, you could find any coverage of bond markets, derivatives, foreign exchange markets and, crucially, debt markets. \"For years all this borrowing and lending was thought of as the equivalent of a sewage system or an electricity grid \u2013 necessary but dull.\" Yet suddenly the sewage started to swill down Threadneedle Street as the grid went up in flames.</p> <p>Peston, from his earlier stints on the <em>Investors Chronicle</em> and the <em>FT</em>, was more up to speed than most. He'd followed the mushroom growth of foreign exchange trading, bond markets, the whole derivatives industry offering you a speculative punt-cum-malign insurance hedge bet on \"the weather in the Caribbean, the unemployment rate in Japan, the risk of political unrest in China\". Make that $43&#xa0;trillion of unallocated loans, around 61% of global GDP. Set these swirling currents of funny money flowing across the world each morning against the shrinking reserves that banks were required to keep liquid and guard against very rainy days, and anyone who understood the true situation could see big, big trouble&#xa0;building. But who, in reality, spotted such looming&#xa0;peril?</p> <p>You can excuse the <em>FT</em> a few boots, give a nod of approval to a small group of watchful pundits; but the list of those who seemed asleep at the wheel is jolting. The press didn't sound the alarm; MPs couldn't tell their credit default swaps from the holes in their socks; the Treasury and its dominant minister \u2013 \"No more boom and bust\" \u2013 looked idiotic the moment the tsunami struck. The feted CEOs of the City's great financial institutions were as far off the pace as any. Maybe greed \u2013 and the fact that the more leveraged you were the fatter the profits you could make, and then pay yourself \u2013 blinded them to the risks they were taking. But maybe, too, they didn't fully comprehend how exposed that left them. Maybe, like so much of a Britain gorged on easy credit over two decades, they didn't understand the state they and we were all in.</p> <p>And \"understanding\", again, is the key word for the future: understanding that one version of capitalism has failed, understanding that we have to boost banks' reserves, regulate their borrowing, get a handle on the casino markets that stretch from Shanghai to Leadenhall Street. It isn't just bankers' bonuses or City pay scales in general that matter. It's understanding what's going on so that we can control it better \u2013 and there's the rub.</p> <p>Do we understand the arcane but decisive markets any more clearly than we did a decade ago? Does George Osborne exude a detailed mastery of his brief, or Ed Balls convince us that just a little more juice would help the engine tick back towards former glories? Have we absorbed the harsh lessons \u2013 here repeated \u2013 about borrowing more today than we can possibly pay back tomorrow? (See homilies about kick-starting growth that, in truth, can probably be forgotten for another 10 years or more).</p> <p>There's a chilling moment Peston recalls from <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01gvryl\" title=\"\">Sir Mervyn King's <em>Today</em> lecture this year</a>, where the Governor says frankly that \"we should have shouted from the rooftops that a system had been built in which the banks were too important to fail\". It's almost a mea culpa, says Peston: but not quite. \"For it was prefaced by 'with the benefit of hindsight' \u2013 and when any of us say 'if I knew then what I know now', we are excusing ourselves, not apologising.\"</p> <p>It's sensible to say that Peston has less to apologise for than many, and to add that his discursive, conversational but entrancingly fact-studded trip around the disaster zone ought to be mandatory reading for anyone who wants to have a voice in where we go from here. Peston and his more shadowy co-author, Laurence Knight, have performed a signal service.</p> <p>But it is also fair to say that their description of how we got into this mess is much more compelling than their prescriptions for how we get out of it, which tend to be now conventional calls for more rigid regulation, more visionary leadership, more public acceptance of hardship and toil. Well, yes: with the benefit of hindsight, that's all fine and dandy. But as a way out of the swamp it doesn't seem overwhelmingly convincing.</p> <p>Peston's last chapter \u2013 rather obviously added near close of publisher play \u2013 is all about rigging the Libor rate and the horror of Barclays. Did he, or anyone else, see that coming when he started on chapter one? And if not, how do we expect to clear away the debris of the past? We may know, in infinite, grisly detail, what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/28/andrew-mitchell-accuses-media-pleb-row\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell</a> said to a policeman in Downing Street, stuff we can debate over a pint without breaking sweat. But when the real stories seize us by the throat, are we any less in the dark than before?</p>",

At the time, Woodcock assumed he'd typed in his details incorrectly so didn't check out the problem with his bank.</p> <p>Next day he logged in and discovered fraudsters had used NatWest's mobile app to transfer \u00a31,500 from a savings account to his current account, then made several withdrawals totalling \u00a3830 via the bank's emergency cash scheme before he managed to get his account blocked.</p> <p>Woodcock says: \"I had my phone on me the whole time, so I'm not sure how they got my details or into my account. But it has made me much more wary about where I do my online banking: I'll only do it on a device I'm absolutely sure of in an environment that is secure \u2013 so no more logging on in internet cafes or using free Wi-Fi on trains.\"</p> <p>He has also been through all the apps on his phone to check for rogue ones and to see what information legitimate ones have access to, deleting those which accessed sensitive data such as his text messages.</p>",
  "<p>More so than most stars, Mika's appeal rests on his silliness \u2013 it was his kitschy poperatics that sent his 2007 hit <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaEPCsQ4608\" title=\"\">Grace Kelly</a> global and made his debut album that year's ninth biggest selling. On his third album, however, he seems to have made the mistake of taking things too seriously. That voice \u2013 part Elton John, part Freddie Mercury and remaining part small&#xa0;child let loose on helium balloons \u2013 pairs uneasily with clubby beats. Other than the perky pabulum of prostitution singalong <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0l2GbVZA04\" title=\"\">Lola</a> and a big fat feelgood chorus on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoZyamCdq3U\" title=\"\">Step with Me</a>,&#xa0;the hooks and hits are thin on the ground.</p>",
  "<p>The fat red sun settles itself against the horizon, throwing a last, honey-sweet light through humid evening and over a&#xa0;small crowd on the lawn beside a railroad track that cuts through the cotton fields beyond. A quarter-moon rises and a chorus of cicadas serenades imminent twilight, now conjoined by the sound of the band; the drummer catches the backbeat and the compere announces: \"How about an Indianola hometown welcome for the one-and-only King of the Blues: BB KING!\"</p> <p>And on he comes, to applause from people who know him well and claim him as their own \u2013 the last of the blues masters a few weeks short of his 87th birthday. \"Nice evening, isn't it?\" he says, and introduces his nephew on sax. Some of his 15 children (all by different mothers) and innumerable grandchildren are in the audience, though one of his daughters died recently of diabetes, as had BB's mother \u2013 a poignant riptide beneath the occasion. \"I guess you can look at me,\" he says from the stage, \"and tell I'm the old man. My name is BB King.\"</p> <p>Backed now by a lilac glow in the western sky \u2013 and looking east towards the village of Itta Bena, where he was born \u2013 BB sits down and starts up the show. He reaches \"Key to the Highway\", and there it is: that one long and trembling note, hanging there in the wafts of barbecue smoke, like only BB King can play it. He rolls his eyes, raises his eyebrows, then stares out into the crowd \u2013 and there's a collective gasp, a ripple of applause, and a mutual bond of affection.</p> <p>This is a huddle, not a crowd, really. The town has come to hear its famous son: mostly black people \u2013 in families, many with a picnic \u2013 plus a few whites with ponytails, ZZ Top beards or other gestures of nonconformity. There are people here like Alfred Knox \u2013 one of 11 children with eight of his own (and 21 grandchildren) \u2013 who left Mississippi for Milwaukee when he was 19, the sound of Honeyboy Edwards playing juke joints ringing in his ears, and has now come back with his nephew Gervis to hear BB, to hear and talk blues, talk politics. The usual jocks and suits who wave bottles of Bud and shout at tourist clubs like BB King's own franchise in Memphis are not here for this annual homecoming concert \u2013 oddly, but thank God.</p> <p>Nor, indeed, are some of Indianola's good citizens. Latunya and her friend were in the post office earlier, and said how \"We're real excited BB's coming back. Gee, I'd lo-o-ove to go see him play. But I go out Fridays. I don't go out Wednesdays, I only go out Fridays\". This is also the town in which the White Citizens Council was formed, political wing of the Ku Klux Klan; and the founders' heirs are probably elsewhere tonight.</p> <p>The maestro's sonority on guitar is as inimitably perfect as ever. After one long, searing note during \"The Thrill is Gone\", BB King darts the stare of a clown right into the front rows, as though to say: \"How about that!?\" But it is BB's voice on the warm breeze that stops a heartbeat \u2013 that feeling behind and between the words that is the quintessence of the blues.</p> <p>This is the 35th Homecoming concert, an event initially staged in memory of Medgar Evers, the civil rights activist and friend of BB's assassinated by a member of the White Citizens' Council. There is something important about BB King's appearance, for the simple reason that even if he is still touring as a 90-something, there will not be that many more of these; nor will there be occasions upon which this great man will reflect on his extraordinary life, which began when he was working out there on the cotton plantations, living alone in a shack, having outlived his mother and then his grandmother.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-396733357\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/26/1348673197204/BB-King-clip-1-013.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip1-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip1-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120926BBKingClip1/120926BBKingClip1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip1_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>All the more reason for that remarkable life to be recounted on film. Jon Brewer's<em> The Life of Riley</em>, released next month, was made after hours talking with BB King, with those who grew up around him, and those \u2013 including many British musicians \u2013 who followed his example. This is the definitive filmed testimony of the last great bluesman.</p> <p>Even more important than the tributes from stars \u2013 Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Bono et al \u2013 are the recollections of people like John Fair and Clemmie Trevellaine, who sit on the porch of their home remembering the day that nine-year-old Riley B King cycled home to live among the cotton fields, working behind a plough, holding the reins of a mule. \"I knew none of this,\" says Brewer. \"I had no idea this had been BB King's life. That he lived alone, in a shack out there, at nine years of age, working for four years to pay off his dead mother's and grandmother's debts. I never knew he was so alone, talking to rabbits, his only friends. And by the time he's telling me this, I'm in tears.\"</p> <p>So it's also a good time for the <em>Observer</em> to speak directly to the master in his hometown, just after his bus pulled up in BB King Street, where, before performing, he broke ground for a new pavement complete with flagstones which will tell his life story. The story he now talks about as we sit in the shade of a pecan tree: : \"I don't do this,\" he smiles, \"but I heard you come all the way from England\". \"Got here a short while ago\", I replied, \"two hours sleep \u2013 and I never thought I'd see the day, when I was 16 and bought this\" \u2013 it's a copy of his album, Indianola Mississippi Seeds. BB laughs and signs the record; his affection for England is musical, not sentimental.</p> <p>There's a turn off the main road into town that leads through the low-slung fields to Itta Bena. The season is waning now: just north of here around Clarksdale, capital of the blues, little clouds of cotton have burst forth \"like popcorn\", as John Steinbeck once remarked; here the white puffs remain closed in their pods. When he was a boy, BB King used to drive his mule through those fields while his Uncle Jack, up front, sung \"the holler\", the descendant of the slave chants and responses, wherein the blues began.</p> <p>\"I remember the holler,\" says BB. \"Holding the reins of a mule pulling a hoe through them cotton fields.\" The field holler, he explains, was a lament sung on a minor scale by a single voice. It also functioned as a communication to alert others in the field that the boss was coming, or that water was needed. \"Yeah, the holler is where it all started. I think it's in all of us.\"</p> <p>Riley B King was born on 16 September 1925, great-grandson of a slave. He moved soon after with his mother to Kilmichael, in Hill Country, to work as a farmhand and listen to his aunt's Blind Lemon Jefferson records. His uncle, the great bluesman Bukka White, would visit from Memphis \u2013 play and sing.</p> <p>First BB's mother died, then the grandmother in whose care he had been placed. \"The blues,\" he would later write, \"was bleeding the same blood as me.\" Picking cotton for 75 cents a day, BB had coveted the local preacher's guitar and was even allowed to \"play a few chords he taught me\". He then made his own, he says: \"We used to make it with wire, the kind you use to make a cotton bail, and tie it to a broom handle. Clamp it down, the sound changed, and I'm playin' music.\" Later, his employer, a white man called Flake Cartledge, advanced him the $15 he needed for a real one.</p> <p>There followed an unhappy period with his father's family way south in Lexington. There, BB witnessed the lynching and castration of a young black man by a white mob \u2013 his crime had been to wolf-whistle at a white girl. Riley King fled Lexington, and his father's new family, cycling alone \"like a bat out of hell, never to return\", back to Itta Bena.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-396733137\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/26/1348672973303/BB-King-clip-2-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip2-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip2-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip2_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120926BBKingClip2/120926BBKingClip2.m3u8\"/> </video>   <p>Nine-year-old Riley King was now back in the Delta, where he worked the fields. picking \"Delta Pinelet\".\"Cotton was a force of nature. There's a poetry to it, hoeing and growing cotton,\" he later wrote. Under the pecan tree, he adds: \"Though it didn't make none of my people rich. I figured out that I must have walked around the world, all those hours and days and weeks behind a mule.\" His biographer Charles Sawyer once asked King: \"How can you play in 90-degree heat in a 3-piece suit?\" To which BB replied: \"I used to work all day in the hot sun in Mississippi.\" Sawyer shook his head and said he would pass out if I tried to play under all those layers of fabric. BB replied: \"Well, Charlie, you're white\".</p> <p>On Saturday nights, workers left the fields for town. \"I was peeping through the slats at a place I'm playing later tonight they call Club Ebony,\" recalls BB, \"to hear Count Basie play, Charlie Parker, too \u2013 and see all those beautiful women in tight dresses jivin' away.\" Young Riley King sang gospel on the street corners of this town, and learned soon that \"the church folks that liked my singing didn't slip me a dime much as the other folks did when I changed sidewalks to the other side of town and changed praising the Lord to praising a lady\", which is another cornerstone of the blues King learned early: it is not just the words of a song, it the mood that matters, convoyed by the larynx, as instrument. That is what defined and defines BB's extraordinary voice. Then there is the instrument itself, the guitar.</p> <p>Several adventures later, BB fulfilled his dream of reaching Memphis to play. He recalls a crucial moment in the history of the guitar style which became his and his alone \u2013 the vibrato that is instantly recognisable as BB King's after only a single note. He was staying with Bukka White, and \"Bukka used to play slide using a bottleneck, or just a piece of pipe. I wanted to do that, and I tried and he showed me how \u2013 but I got stupid fingers, see, and I just couldn't do it.\" However: \"The sound Bukka made went all through me, and I devised my own technique for producing the tremolo without the slide.\" He calls it \"the butterfly. I swivel my wrist from my elbow, back and forth, and this stretches the string, raising and lowering the pitch of the note rhythmically. With my other fingers stretched out, my whole hand makes a fluttering gesture, a bit like a butterfly flapping its wings.\"</p> <p>Thus the BB King sound was born \u2013 a sound that expresses mood, feeling, blue or otherwise. In Brewer's film, there is a montage in which most of the great guitarists of their generation acknowledge it, and the ability to recognise it. King himself says it another way: \"I tried to connect my singing voice to my guitar an' my guitar to my singing voice. Like the two was talking to one another.\" Jon Brewer confirms a detail which explains the dialogue between voice and guitar differently: \"BB's secret is that he can't sing and play at the same time.\"</p> <p>BB King called his guitar Lucille after someone else's fight in a juke joint knocked over a container of kerosene that was the heating system. The place caught fire, the crowd fled, but BB realised he had left his guitar inside and ran to get it. Chastised for his recklessness, he discovered that the fight had been over a girl called Lucille. \"I named my guitar Lucille,\" he says in <em>The Life of Riley</em>, \"to remind myself not to do something like that again, and I haven't.\"</p> <p>The blues went north, with the great migration from the mechanised cotton fields, in pursuit of work in the big cities. For the most part they accompanied the majority of the black exodus to the burgeoning megalopolis of Chicago. Each musician from what became the golden age of the blues mutated the Delta sound to form their own style \u2013 Elmore James, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf \u2013 within that Windy City electric sound. But BB King chose a different scene, on Beale Street in Memphis, closer to home up the Mississippi reaches. He came to forge a more rounded, less feral timbre than Muddy or the Wolf, with a bigger band including brass and rhythm sections.</p> <p>Blues Boy King \u2013 shortened to BB \u2013 became a radio star at WDIA, the blues station in Memphis. He built his band, he ensured that he tour on a bus, he made lifelong friends, he left his first wife and indulged his love of women \u2013 and released his first hit, \"Three O'Clock Blues\".</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-396733153\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/26/1348672753953/BB-King-clip-3-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip3-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip3-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip3_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120926BBKingClip3/120926BBKingClip3.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/9/26/120926BBKingClip3_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>In <em>The Life of Riley</em>, Calvin Owens \u2013 trumpeter in the original BB King band \u2013 recalls those days on what was called the segregated Chitlin' Circuit, named after animal offal that black people were said to enjoy eating, but not whites \u2013 \"Though I never called it any Chitlin' Circuit,\" says BB King. \"The road,\" says Owens, \"is home\", and it remained BB's home for the rest of his life. Sometimes he did 350 performances a year \u2013 \"I like my job,\" he says, under the pecan tree. BB King married a second time, to Sue Carol Hill, daughter of the owner of the Club Ebony \u2013 founded in 1907 \u2013 where BB used to peep and later play. Their marriage, while it lasted, was lived on the road. Staying, of course, in segregated black hotels, eating at segregated black restaurants.</p> <p>\"I've put up with more humiliation than I care to remember,\" King wrote in his autobiography <em>Blues All Around Me</em>. \"Touring a segregated America \u2013 forever being stopped and harassed by white cops hurt you most cos you don't realise the damage. You hold it in. You feel empty, like someone reached in and pulled out your guts. You feel hurt and dirty, less than a person.\" There was one night at the Gaston Hotel in Birmingham, Alabama, where BB King was staying at the same time as Dr Martin Luther King, when \"they bombed the place. The bomb rocked my room.\" Now BB King is back to be honoured in the city where the White Citizens' Council was formed.</p> <p>Last time I was in this area, around Clarksdale, it was to report on poverty \u2013 and in Mississippi, that means black poverty. It was the year of the election between Al Gore and George W Bush, and I sat with old Ruby Walker on her porch with most of her 22 cats frolicking around her. The next few days would be particularly hard for the Walker family, since they were to have marked the 19th birthday of Ruby's granddaughter, Sandra Handy. However, there was a different anniversary: \"She was just crossing the railroad line on her way home this time last year when the shooting started and a bullet hit her right in the head.\" There is a macabre intimacy to the murder. Ruby gestured towards the house behind her, and folks hanging out their washing to dry in the muggy heat: \"It was their boy done the shooting. He only got 10 years and it's hard to look at them every day.\" He was, she adds, \"one of the gangbangers \u2013 fighting for territory\".</p> <p>Like BB King's, Ruby's great-grandparents were slaves working these cotton fields. \"And so was I, after a fashion,\" she reflected. \"We worked from sun-up to sundown, and the money was cheap.\" Her daughter Mary became the fifth cotton-picking generation until she found work in a local school. But, added Ruby, the furrows deepening across her brow: \"I sometimes wonder if they ever really did do away with slavery. I don't know what's happening round here no more. All I know is it was better in the 40s than it is now.\"</p> <p>That same visit I met a relative of the Fair family, who shared a plot with young BB King, and who \u2013 in Brewer's film \u2013 recalls him as a boy cycling home from Lexington. Shirley Fair was the owner of a flower store in Clarksdale called Ooh So Pretty Flowers, where a meeting was arranged with President Bill Clinton when he blew through on his Poverty Tour of 1999. But, said Mrs Fair, \"nothing has gotten any better. There's nothing here to grasp on to. The railroad is closed, the factories have gone. The good folks move on and the gangbangers take over the streets, and that makes it harder for businesses to survive. The president wrote me a letter saying I could apply for a grant and employ 10 people. But there were so many rules and regulations I couldn't understand nothing. Always something to slow you and stop you. So I did stop.\"</p> <p>Nights round here are different when BB King is not in town. Down at the Club Sugar in Jonestown \u2013 a ramshackle brick cabin beside the railroad track \u2013 lads like Q, with his blue bandana, are arriving to drown their sorrows and thoughts in the barrage of rap music while his friend Icy Man, although in the middle of a conversation, pulls hard on a tube of \"rocks\", his eyes glazing over, his face frozen in oblivion. It's like finding the old 70s Bronx in the middle of a 21st-century cotton plantation, and the crowd soon moves to a joint nearer the village centre, Hot Spot. We ask if we can take pictures of the heaving and dancing, to be told politely that this would be a \"bad idea because a lot of the guys here are wanted. They're serious.\" Our host, a man called Clee, who dislikes rap and who dreams mainly of setting up a blues band in town, adds: \"They're not local, they're County.\"</p> <p>BB King knows all this. And he is not as self-satisfied as one might expect him to be with \"progress\" since the bad old days. For sure he jammed at the White House with a black president, and there's a BB King Day in the Mississippi calendar \u2013 but also the confederate ensign is its state flag. \"We've come a long, long way,\" says BB King, \"but we ain't come far enough. There's still a long, long way to go.\" I ask if he is aware of his own role in that \"long, long way\" since he saw a man lynched and shared a bombed-out motel with Martin Luther King. \"I'd like to think I made a lil' footprint in the sand,\" he replies, and puts his arm around a young boy next to us, on his right. \"This here little boy's the same age as me when I was holding the reins of a mule. He won't never know those times, but I wonder what this boy will grow up to do. I wonder\u2026\"</p> <p>However: \"The racists couldn't legislate musical taste,\" writes BB. The influence of BB King and the blues over great white musicians from the generation that followed him is a slice from one of the most compelling stories in 20th-century music and culture: how white hipsters, many of them British, seized on the Delta and Chicago blues, bringing those who sang them before a vast white \u2013 and ultimately global \u2013 audience, to the amazement of the elderly bluesmen themselves.</p> <p>There is a wonderful moment in <em>The Life of Riley</em> concerning a gig BB King was playing in Chicago at which four white people arrived. \"One of them was extra white,\" recalls BB, referring to the albino Johnny Winter, a master blues guitarist with long straight hair and pencil-thin tattooed arms. BB was afraid they were from the IRS tax authorities, a perennial bane of his life. Winter asked if he could \"sit in on a number\", and the master was clearly ambivalent. But: \"He was good. I tell you, he was good.\"</p> <p>By the time BB King recorded perhaps his greatest album, <em>Live at the Regal</em>, in 1964, mainstream America and much of black America had forgotten about the blues in favour of rock'n'roll and embryonic soul. But the hipsters remained true. John Mayall nurtured a stable that included Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Mick Taylor later of Cream, Fleetwood Mac and the Rolling Stones \u2013 and lesser-known names propelled the British blues explosion: Chicken Shack, Savoy Brown, Wishbone Ash, Keef Hartley \u2026</p> <p>Jon Brewer recalls the moment: \"You had these new bands playing bingo halls and Meccas, supporting Cliff Richard or Engelbert Humperdink or whoever, and wondering: 'Which way do we go?' And they found this really good stuff played by black musicians that was far superior to what we had here. So you had people like John Mayall and Peter Green thinking: 'This is the real thing.'\"</p> <p>(My own interest was deep and irrevocable from the night that Son House, Bukka White, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee arrived to play at Hammersmith Odeon in 1967. I was compelled, edge-of-seat, and hooked for life. When the white bluesmen went to America, recalls Keith Richards in Brewer's film: \"They wanted to know what we were doing and why we were doing it.\")</p> <p>\"I can tell BB from one note,\" says Eric Clapton, in Brewer's film. \"Most of us can.\" He has, says Clapton, \"a certain melodic sense unique to himself.\"</p> <p>Bill Wyman recalls BB King's tremolo when the two came to record together in 1971: \"He showed me how to do it \u2013 buggered if I could.\"</p> <p>There is an extraordinary sequence in the film where BB describes his arrival at Bill Graham's Fillmore West in San Francisco, when queues of white hippies were in the street. At first BB thinks he is in the wrong place but confesses that he was so moved by several standing ovations he \"cried back up the stairway\". In our interview under the pecan tree, King calls it \"my breakthrough moment. It was an unusual situation. You had all these people playing the blues: Mike Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop were good, Clapton was good, Johnny Winter was good, Peter Green was good.\" And he leans forward as if to impart some secret: \"They had something. They introduced us to a whole new world. And we learned a lot from people like Clapton and Peter Green. I ain't gonna tell you what it is,\" he says in a whisper, \"but we learned something. They did something for the blues.\"</p> <p>BB King once wrote, when discussing his technique, that \"Lucille was singing the blues better than me.\" But now he says something intriguingly different: \"You've heard me call myself a bluesman and a blues singer,\" he says. \"I call myself a blues singer, but you ain't never heard me call myself a blues guitar man. Well, that's because there's been so many can do it better'n I can, play the blues better'n me. I think a lot of them have told me things, taught me things. But they just ain't me, that's all. They're not BB King.\" It's a remark that emphasises the primacy of BB King's voice, that all-expressive rasp, that howl of desire or of pain.</p> <p>I've had BB King to myself for 25 minutes now, surrounded by people who've known him for decades. Old friends and family plus young fans come to behold him for the first time, and it feels like a levee is about to break \u2013 not to unleash the Mississippi backwaters, but this throng of good people.</p> <p>BB King ends our interview with an observation that hallmarks true greatness. In the film he had said: \"When I hear what I want to hear, I'd have to stop.\" Now he elaborates: \"I think I've done the best I could have done. But I keep wanting to play better, go further. There are so many sounds I still want to make, so many things I haven't yet done. When I was younger I thought maybe I'd reached that peak. But I'm 86 now, and if I make it through to next month, I'll be 87. And now I know it can never be perfect, it can never be exactly what it should be, so you got to keep going further, getting better.\"</p> <p>On the subject of women, BB King's book is markedly \u2013 almost disarmingly \u2013 candid. And he says now: \"I never met a woman I didn't like.

Not only for this part of town, on very much the wrong side of those railway tracks \u2013 where blues juke joints and rural slums are huddled against one another and hopping to life \u2013 but for the 86-year-old also.</p> <p>Two hours after bidding farewell, BB is due to take the stage again at what is one of the most historically charged venues in America, that same Club Ebony, founded in 1907, where as a boy Riley B King would peep through the slats wide-eyed at the \"jitterbugging, snake-hipping and trucking\", as he describes it.</p> <p>Around 11pm BB King appears onstage, much of his audience one over the eight, talkative but mellow, ready for what is (in my book at least) the experience of a lifetime. The blues master who has played to stadia and venues across the world settles on his chair as if in his own living room, which in a way this is. There's a power problem: \"Guess I didn't pay my bill on time,\" he chuckles.</p> <p>Then he picks up Lucille and plays those notes \u2013 long notes, impossibly stretched, at moments crashing into some zone Hendrix might have navigated. Perhaps oddly, King indulges in less eye contact with the juke-joint tables across which the beers and liquor flow than he did his outdoor audience. He greets them, and banters of course: \"Well, sweet ol' Indianola!\" \u2013 but is in a world of his own now, less the showman than the musician listening hard to his own alchemy.</p> <p>Outside in the sauna of night, poor young men in gangland attire gather to watch those with tickets a-coming and going; there's a buzz around the big event, never mind at it \u2013 drugs for sale, police bundling someone into a van, guards patrolling the visitors' parked cars and lads eyeing them up.</p> <p>BB swings through his all-time greats now. The air fills with whisky fumes and a surprising level of chatter, and there are curses exchanged with a redneck family, one of whom is blind drunk, unsteady on his feet, blocking people's views and trying to steal an elderly man's fedora hat. For \"Every Day I Have The Blues\", BB's voice is like that instrument again, at once guttural but velvet, while he apparently sings with his guitar, Lucille talking back to the singer. There's a rendition of \"See That My Grave Is Kept Clean\" \u2013 that great blues anthem about the imminence of death that makes the blood run cold: it has a chunky-rolling feel to it, pierced by the searing defiance of King's guitar, and the nearest he gets to a field holler tonight even if it's on Lucille. \"Not bad for an 86-year-old,\" he says, signing off the night that has now become early morning in cotton country.</p> <p>The Life of Riley<em> is out on 15 October</em></p>",
  "<p>As actress Salma Hayek gushed before Hedi Slimane's womenswear show for Yves Saint Laurent last week, smoothing down the black net gown into which she had been poured: \"I think everyone is super-excited. He made this dress for me. It's not bad, no?\"</p> <p>But this turned out to be the high point. Because at Paris fashion week the most eagerly awaited debut of the fashion calendar fell flat. And Slimane got caught up in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/oct/05/paris-fashion-week-dior-ysl?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">a childish spat</a> with influential fashion writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/oct/03/hedi-slimane-cathy-horyn-fashion-spat?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Cathy Horyn</a>. She called him self-important. He used the words \"average and provincial\". The fashion world looked on with horror and barely disguised delight.</p> <p>Slimane's first collection for Yves Saint Laurent was seen elsewhere as \"underwhelming and lacking the frisson of the unexpected\". Worse, the global fashion pack felt snubbed by the master.</p> <p>One newspaper reported that \"glum-looking indie kids in black drainpipes [Slimane's friends] got to see the clothes from the front row\" while fashion writers stood at the back. The website <a href=\"http://www.businessoffashion.com/\" title=\"\">the Business of Fashion </a>said the game was up the moment you heard \"the somewhat muted applause and hushed voices after the show\".</p> <p>But things really kicked off when the review came in from Cathy Horyn of the <em>New York Times</em>, who had been banned from the show. \"The lack of professional courtesy smacked of ignorance or arrogance,\" she wrote, having reviewed the collection from digital images. \"Nice but frozen.\" \"The clothes \"lacked a new fashion spirit.\" And the killer blow: \"I had the impression from the clothes of someone disconnected from fashion of the past several years.\" Slimane has been working as a photographer in Los Angeles for five years.</p> <p>On Twitter, where Slimane goes by the rather unfortunate name <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hedislimanetwit\" title=\"\">@hedislimanetwit</a>, the designer hit back: \"What is 'silly nonsense' to me is Catty Horyn still singing her tired bias tune.\" Then he posted an open letter online. \"Miss Horyn is a schoolyard bully and also a little bit of a stand-up comedian. Insiders argue she is an average writer, and a bit provincial, but I disagree, she did some great things.\"</p> <p>He goes on: \"As far as I'm concerned, she will never get a seat at Saint Laurent but might get 2 for 1 at Dior. She should rejoice. I don't mind critics [critiques], but they have to come from a fashion critic, not a publicist in disguise. I am quite mesmerised she did get away with it for so many years.\"</p> <p>This spat comes at a time when the industry is savouring the battle between Hedi Slimane at Yves Saint Laurent and <a href=\"http://www.dior.com/magazine/en_gb/News/The-New-Couture\" title=\"\">Raf Simons</a> at Christian Dior, rivals in their first year of a new job. This is a huge moment in fashion history as two of the biggest houses have welcomed two controversial new talents at the same time. Dior hasn't had a new designer for 12 years, Yves Saint Laurent for eight. Their press offices have been working overtime to increase the mystique surrounding their high-profile new recruits.</p> <p>Raf Simons at Dior, whose show was rapturously received ahead of Slimane's, is being closely scrutinised, first, because he's stepping into the disgraced John <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/08/john-galliano-guilty-racism-antisemitism\" title=\"\">Galliano</a>'s shoes, and, second, because this is a job that could have been Slimane's. Before Slimane quit designing for a few years he worked at Dior Homme for seven years.</p> <p>The two of them are fascinating to compare partly because of their similarities. Both are seen as mavericks, innovators and independent thinkers. Horyn puts her exclusion from Slimane's shows down to her positive reviews of his rival: \"He felt (as best as I can tell) that I gave preference to Mr Simons in my coverage of the men's shows.\"</p> <p>Until now, Hedi Slimane, who was born in Paris in 1968 to an Italian mother and Tunisian father, has been regarded as a sort of demigod in the fashion world. He is seen as a rock star type with a passing resemblance to James Dean. For his sixth birthday, he received a copy of the David Bowie album <em>David Live</em>. He has said that glam rock is \"the most significant creative influence for the future in both design and photography\".</p> <p>He made clothes for himself from the age of 16 and studied art history, photography and political science in Paris, thinking of becoming a photographer or a journalist. After a brief stint as an assistant at Louis Vuitton, he began his \"proper\" career at Yves Saint Laurent menswear in 1996, moving to Dior Homme in 2000.</p> <p>He is often likened to <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1053530/\" title=\"\">Tom Ford</a>, a creative branding genius who happens to have applied himself to fashion but can drift in and out of things as he pleases, picking and choosing pet projects. As a photographer during his \"years off\", he took acclaimed portraits of <a href=\"http://www.soulculture.co.uk/music-blog/amy-winehouse-photographed-by-hedi-slimane-portrait-set/\" title=\"\">Amy Winehouse</a>, Lady Gaga, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Robert De Niro and Kate Moss. His artistic vision has been described as \"sculptural\", which is supposedly why he moves easily between photography and clothing design.</p> <p>But Slimane's return to fashion with this womenswear debut has been blighted by a PR faux pas. Fashion reporters attending the show last week received emails explaining that the fashion house must be referred to as \"the house of Yves Saint Laurent\". But credits for the collection should cite \"Saint Laurent by Hedi Slimane.\" Furthermore: \"Saint Laurent Paris is used in the logo but not when spoken or written about the collection.\" What? The design house says this is a return to its original roots. Instead, it feels like Patsy from <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jm3ms\" title=\"\"><em>Ab Fab</em></a> took over.\"</p> <p>Slimane has become more reclusive since his return to fashion and will only be interviewed by email, hence the excitement over his rare tweets. He gave no interviews in connection with the latest collection, which was also seen as insulting. In his menswear days, he was given to interesting pronouncements, however. \"People always want an explanation about everything and I cannot give it to them. Because I don't know myself. 'Why did you do a pair of pants like that?' I have no idea. I'm not going to have a 20-minute political discussion about the necessity for slashed, painted leather jeans. Basically, I don't know more than you.\"</p> <p>At Dior Homme, he attracted as many female fans as male, with Madonna and Nicole Kidman as well as David Bowie, Tom Cruise, Jack White and Mick Jagger among his clients. One early coup was Brad Pitt's wedding suit. Dior Homme's sales increased by 41% the following year. During his menswear's heyday, Tom Kalenderian, executive vice president at Barneys in New York, said of Slimane's style: \"It's extraordinarily modern and right for our time. Hedi has carved a following and he continues to attract new customers as well.\"</p> <p>Slimane championed what became known as the new \"skinny\" aesthetic in men's fashion: black skinny jeans, skinny black ties, short-waisted jackets and close-fitted blazers. He was known for picking his male models from the streets, from rock concerts, from football games in the park. He has described his work as representing a fixation on the \"transient age between childhood and adulthood\".</p> <p>But his take on \"fleeting, sepulchral beauty\" has also been accused of vaunting \"a certain prepubescent androgyny\". He takes the androgyny accusation on the chin saying: \"Hedi was and is still misspelled 'Heidi' and my perception of genders ended up slightly out of focus from an early age.\"</p> <p>At the height of Slimane's success in menswear, Cathy Horan wrote a review directly comparing him with Raf Simons. Horan explains: \"Essentially I wrote that without Mr Simons's template of slim tailoring and street casting, there would not have been a Hedi Slimane \u2013 just as there would never have been a Raf Simons without Helmut Lang. Fashion develops a bit like a genetic line. Anyway, Mr Slimane insisted that he was the first to show the skinny suit. It was a silly debate. Who cares?\"</p> <p>Someone obviously does. Slimane has always had a reputation as a perfectionist and a potential return to Dior following the exit of Galliano was reportedly abandoned after he insisted on all the company's shops being refitted according to his specifications. Last week's events will only enhance his image as an unpredictable character. Or, as one fashion editor put it, a \"bitch\".</p> <p>Slimane's carefully cultivated \"cool\" persona does slightly jar with the angry blog and tweets. But as he says: \"Fashion somehow, for me, is purely and happily irrational.\" In any case, not all the reviews were bad. Fellow designer Diane Von Furstenberg, who is old enough to have seen the original Yves Saint Laurent the first time around, purred: \"Beautiful. I thought it was pure Saint Laurent. And I recognised my youth.\" Or is that another barb, darling?</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Pre-match ponderings:</strong> Hello! And welcome to a gloriously sunny autumnal Saturday afternoon, packed with the kind of unbelievably exciting fixtures which make the Premier League the best league in the entire world, better in oh so many ways than all the other countries' leagues, such as Swansea v Reading, and West Brom v QPR.</p> <p>Oh.</p> <p>As it happens, this afternoon's four top-flight fixtures feature every single member of the current Premier League bottom three, and just 30% of the current Premier League top 10. But we won't let that bother us, and will instead put all our energy into getting excited about third-placed <strong>Everton</strong>, who are at <strong>Wigan</strong>, sixth-placed <strong>West Brom</strong> against Mark Hughes' bottom-of-the-pile Rangers, and table-topping <strong>Chelsea</strong>. The latter will be proving that the old \"most competitive league in the world\" canard isn't quite all it's cracked up to be by slamming a bootful of beauties past hapless <strong>Norwich</strong> (disclaimer: some assumptions were made in the preparation of this sentence), who shipped five at home to previously winless Liverpool last time out. All eyes on John Terry and Ashley Cole, if selected (and their Twitter accounts if not).</p> <p>But we're not only interested in the top flight, even if we are denied the chance to follow the fortunes of the new leaders of the Championship because Cardiff's visit to hopelessly-out-of-sorts Ipswich is today's televised late kick-off. They could find themselves second by then, if <strong>Leicester</strong> extend their four-game run of wins at home to <strong>Bristol City</strong> (and to be more accurate, they could find themselves fifth if they get seriously unlucky). Also interesting: <strong>Blackburn</strong> hosting fellow Maytime Premier League relegationees <strong>Wolves</strong>; third-place <strong>Brighton</strong> taking the division's best away record to <strong>Derby</strong>; and rock-bottom <strong>Peterborough</strong>, who lost their first seven league games but have won their last two \u2013 away from home and everything \u2013 hosting 17th-place <strong>Nottingham Forest</strong> knowing that a third win on the spin would see them overtake their opponents and (probably) saunter merrily clear of the bottom three.</p> <p>In <strong>League One</strong>, unbeaten table-toppers <strong>Tranmere</strong> \u2013 \"If we play like we did in the second half at Scunthorpe, I don't think there's anyone in this league who can live with us,\" says Ronnie Moore \u2013 visit a <strong>Notts County</strong> side still in fourth but smarting after a nasty midweek defeat to second-placed Stevenage. \"What you don't do after a defeat is get off the bus,\" said Keith Curle, and I for one have absolutely no idea what he means.</p> <p>And in <strong>League Two</strong> there'll be a bit of a mini-league involving four of the top five, with second-placed <strong>Port Vale</strong> visiting fourth-placed <strong>Exeter</strong>, and fifth-placed <strong>Cheltenham</strong> hosting third-placed <strong>Fleetwood</strong>. <strong>Gillingham</strong>, already five points clear, will gleefully watch them all take points off each other while they seek to extend their 100% away record at mid-table <strong>Oxford United</strong>.</p> <p>So, that's what I'm excited about today \u2013 well, that and my own team's inevitable victory over whichever hapless bunch of unfortunates are unlucky enough to be ordered into their fearsome arena. What have I missed?</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>2.21pm: This Blackburn-related news is just in from the Press Association: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Alan Shearer has admitted he is open to the possibility of taking up the vacant manager's role at Blackburn. The former Rovers striker, who had a short spell in management with Newcastle, spent four years at Ewood Park as a player. When asked about his interest in the job, the 42-year-old told BBC's Football Focus: \"I've not spoken to the Blackburn owners. If they approached me I would speak to them.\" </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>2.28pm: Chelsea's team has been widely tweeted but not yet Press Associationed, so you'll have to make do with Swansea v Reading:<br><strong>Swansea:</strong> Vorm, Rangel, Chico, Williams, Davies, Dyer, Britton, Michu, Ki, Routledge, Graham. <strong>Subs:</strong> Tremmel, Tate, Hern\u00e1ndez, Shechter, Moore, De Guzman, Tiendalli. <br><strong>Reading:</strong> McCarthy, Shorey, Mariappa, Gorkss, Cummings, McAnuff, Karacan, Tabb, Kebe, Pogrebnyak, Hunt. <strong>Subs: </strong>Stuart Taylor, Pearce, Le Fondre, McCleary, Robson-Kanu, Guthrie, Roberts. <br><strong>Referee:</strong> Mike Dean (Wirral).</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>2.30pm: And here are some more teams. I'll post all the Premier League line-ups as I get them, but feel free to request others.<br><strong>Wigan:</strong> Al Habsi, Ramis, Caldwell, Figueroa, Boyce, McCarthy, McArthur, Beausejour, Kone, Di Santo, Maloney.<strong> Subs:</strong> Pollitt, Jones, Watson, Gomez, McManaman, Boselli, Miyaichi. <br><strong>Everton:</strong> Howard, Coleman, Jagielka, Heitinga, Baines, Mirallas, Neville, Osman, Pienaar, Fellaini, Jelavic. <strong>Subs:</strong> Mucha, Oviedo, Naismith, Distin, Gueye, Anichebe, Duffy. <br><strong>Referee: </strong>Kevin Friend (Leicestershire).</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>2.35pm: The Chelsea team is in, and John Terry and Ashley Cole both start.<br><strong>Chelsea:</strong> Cech, Ivanovic, Lu\u00edz, Terry, Cole, Mikel, Lampard, Mata, Oscar, Hazard, Torres. <strong>Subs: </strong>Turnbull, Romeu, Ramires, Moses, Cahill, Azpilicueta, Bertrand. <br><strong>Norwich:</strong> Ruddy, Russell Martin, Barnett, Bassong, Garrido, Elliott Bennett, Howson, Hoolahan, Johnson, Tettey, Holt. <strong>Subs: </strong>Bunn, Turner, Snodgrass, Jackson, Pilkington, Morison, Ryan Bennett. <br><strong>Referee:</strong> Anthony Taylor (Cheshire).</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>2.39pm: And to complete the Premier League pack, this is how the sides will line up at the Hawthorns:<br><strong>West Brom:</strong> Foster, Tamas, McAuley, Olsson, Popov, Yacob, Mulumbu, Gera, Morrison, Odemwingie, Long. <strong>Subs: </strong>Luke Daniels, Rosenberg, Dorrans, Jara Reyes, Lukaku, Dawson, Fortun\u00e9. <br><strong>QPR:</strong> Julio Cesar, Bosingwa, Ferdinand, Nelsen, Hill, Granero, Mbia, Wright-Phillips, Taarabt, Park, Zamora.<strong> Subs:</strong> Green, Traor\u00e9, Ciss\u00e9, Mackie, Onuoha, Hoilett, Faurlin. <br><strong>Referee: </strong>Mike Jones (Cheshire).</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>2.40pm: Manchester City have comprehensively beaten Sunderland 3-0 at the Etihad. Nothing now to distract us from those 3pm kick-offs.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>2.53pm: Sky's Soccer Saturday panel are discussing unpopular managers. I'm mildly surprised to hear that the one manager who Matt Le Tissier played under but didn't like, was Glenn Hoddle.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>2.56pm: Players are strolling onto pitches across the nation. We're moments from matchtime.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>3.00pm: Let's play football!</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>3.03pm: Fernando Torres just broke the Norwich offside trap, with three minutes played, but delayed his shot, was forced wide, then had to check back and give the ball away. He should just have smacked it into the back of the net.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>3.06pm: <strong>GOAL! West Brom 1 QPR 0!</strong> Lovely cross from Shane Long on the right wing, who pegged it past his full-back as if on a jet pack, and then curled the ball onto the head of James Morrison, who headed back across goal and in. Simple, and excellent.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>3.07pm: \"Ashley Cole, he tweets what he wants,\" sing the Chelsea fans.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>3.11pm: <strong>GOALS! First, Chelsea 0 Norwich 1!</strong> A superbly controlled low volley from Holt from 15 yards out, from some other fella's knock-down.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>3.12pm: <strong>Another goal! Wigan 1 Everton 0!</strong> This time it's a cross from the left which Arouna Kon\u00e9 nods in from two yards out. Was he offside? It certainly looked that way!</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>3.14pm: <strong>And another goal! Wigan 1 Everton 1!</strong> Another header from no distance out! Everton bring the ball towards the edge of Wigan's area but the player who attempts a curler to the far post falls over while he's doing it, and the ball is miscued onto the head of Jelavic, two yards beyond the far post, who nodded in.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>3.16pm: <strong>And yet another goal! Chelsea 1 Norwich 1!</strong> And that's the goal of the day so far. Mata gets the ball on the right wing, towards the byline. He backheels to Ivanovic, whose excellent first-time cross is headed into the far corner by Fernando Torres.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>3.23pm: <strong>GOAL! Chelsea 2 Norwich 1!</strong> Torres attempts to overhead kick a bouncing ball in the Norwich penalty area, and indeed succeeds in completing the overhead kick. But instead of flying into the back of the net the ball scoots away from goal, straight to the onrushing Frank Lampard, who lashes it in from 18 yards.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>3.25pm: <strong>GOAL! West Brom 2 (Zoltan Gera 22) QPR 0!</strong> Must admit I totally missed that one, but Matt Le Tissier tells me it was a nasty miskicked clearance from Anton Ferdinand that Gera simply slotted in.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>3.26pm: <strong>Another goal! Wigan 2 Everton 1! </strong>This time Kon\u00e9 is the provider, running down the right wing, cutting into the penalty area and then rolling the ball, alarmingly slowly, just about into the path of Franco Di Santo, who slams it into the roof of the net from 12 yards.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>3.30pm: Bradley Johnson just injured two Chelsea players in the space of about a second, bashing into Mikel and then slashing away at Lu\u00edz, as if engaged in some kind of human skittles. Both the boys in blue roll around for a while, looking quite put out, before getting on with the game. No booking for Johnson, which seems like a stroke of luck for the lad.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>3.32pm: <strong>GOAL! Chelsea 3 Norwich 1!</strong> Mata carries the ball 40 yards and then slices the Norwich defence entirely and convincingly apart with a delicious killer pass, and Eden Hazard passes it into the corner of the net. That was very nice. They could score 50 here.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>3.34pm: <strong>GOAL! Swansea 0 Reading 1!</strong> Swansea pass the ball around their defence, as they do. Pok, pok, pok, pok, pok. It ends up with Vorm, and Reading closing him down, so he puts his foot through it. Big mistake. Ten seconds later, and without touching the ball again, the home side are behind, Pogrebnyak eventually poking it under the keeper and into the net.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p>3.35pm: <strong>GOAL! West Brom 2 QPR 1!</strong> That's a super goal! Granero hits the ball over the West Brom defence \u2013 or three of them, the left back being 10 yards further back \u2013 and Taarabt chests it down and volleys it emphatically into the net. Nicely done.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p>3.37pm: Crikey! So many Premier League goals, it really is the best league in the world.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p>3.40pm: Another chance for Chelsea. Oscar collects the ball a couple of yards outside the penalty area, and with a small army of Norwich defenders blocking his path. He casually skips his way through them, but his side-footed finish is equally casual and Ruddy saves.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p>3.44pm: Another chance at Stamford Bridge, but this one falls to Norwich. Not much to it, really \u2013 a looping cross from the left wing, Grant Holt unmarked in the middle, and his header bounces a yard wide.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p>3.46pm: And a chance at the Hawthorns, where Morrison (I think) is played clean through, but Julio Cesar saves!</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p>3.47pm: <strong>GOAL! Swansea 0 Reading 2! </strong>A Reading player has a shot blocked, but the ball falls to another Reading player, whose shot is also blocked, but the ball falls to a third Reading player, whose shot is also blocked, and this time the ball loops to Noel Hunt who volleys home from eight yards.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>3.53pm: Fun and games at Vicarage Road, where Matej Vydra was sent off just before half-time \u2013 but nobody knows why. Chris Kamara on Soccer Saturday had no idea, and Watford's official Twitter feed is reporting that the \"crowd, journos and players [are] equally confused\". They're 1-1 with Middlesbrough at the break.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>3.57pm: \"Greetings from Cairo,\" writes Simon Frank. \"With Chelsea handing out a pounding today, are we to expect a 'Ruddy Hell' headline tomorrow?\" Quite possibly, Simon \u2013 but <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4337807/England-Euro-2012-news-John-Ruddy-out-of-Euros-with-broken-finger.html\">it wouldn't be the first time we'd have seen it</a>, I'm afraid.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p>4.01pm: Let's play football!</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p>4.04pm: At Stamford Bridge, the first chance of the second half falls to Norwich, with Grant Holt again beating Terry in the air, but heading wide.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>4.07pm: \"Simon, why on earth are the Norwich crowd booing Cole?\" asks Barry Praag. \"Are they FA stooges!\" There are any number of things that convince fans to boo an opposing player, some of them bizarrely trivial, but being Ashley Cole has got to be among the most compelling (for all that he's been a brilliant full-back).</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p>4.09pm: Chelsea should have had a penalty there, as Barnett fairly cynically sticks out a leg to bring down Juan Mata, but the referee's not impressed.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p>4.11pm: More on the ghost red card at Vicarage Road. \"Saw footage at HT with Chris Kamara, here at #watfordfc for Sky Sports,\" writes whoever writes Watford's official Twitter feed. \"Kamara in absolutely no doubt that there was nothing in it at all.\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>4.13pm: Swansea hit the post! That was a not-very-good header that Alex McCarthy darn nearly flapped into the back of the net. In the end he merely flapped it onto the post, which was a stroke of luck. Having said that, I've just seen someone else on Twitter say the header was \"brilliantly turned onto the post\", so I could be being a tad harsh.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p>4.19pm: I may be making a bit of a big deal of this red card at Vicarage Road, which Kamara has now said on Sky Sports was \"completely wrong\", but a glance at <a href=\"http://www.soccerbase.com/referees/referee.sd?referee_id=1055\">the referee's stats for the season</a> are illuminating \u2013 it's his eighth red card in 10 league games. Last season he produced six in 34 \u2013 what happened to him this summer?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p>4.30pm: Ryan Dunne points out that Norwich fans might have been convinced to boo Ashley Cole not just by yesterday's Anti-FA Twitter outburst, but by the section of Cheryl Cole's forthcoming autobiography serialised in today's Sun. This details his extramarital indiscretions \u2013 \"Over the next few days I heard two more girls had come forward to say they'd had sex with Ashley. I didn't read the stories, but I knew one was saying it happened when Ashley and I were courting, and another said she slept with him a few months after our wedding.\" \u2013 and includes her yelling at her footballing then-husband: \"I hope she was worth it. It's the end of your marriage. It's f***ed!\"</p> <p>Incidentally, courting? Courting? Are you living in the 1950s, Cheryl?</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p>4.31pm: <strong>GOAL! Swansea 1 Reading 2! </strong>Routledge's cross from just outside the right corner of the penalty area clips a defender's arse and skews to the far post, where Machu Pichu scores with a diving header. About time we had a Premier League goal, I must say.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p>4.34pm: <strong>GOAL!

  "<p>Juli\u00e0n Castro, the mayor of San Antonio who burst on to the national political stage when he made the keynote address at the Democratic national convention in September, is selling his vision of the future to the city's top moneymakers. He pictures a Manhattan-like metropolitan core, with walkable streets and arts and culture worthy of America's seventh-largest city.</p> <p>Castro calls this vision \"San Antonio 2020\". In a city where <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/48/4865000.html\">two-thirds of the 1.3 million residents are of Latino heritage</a>, it is tempting to call it \"veinte veinte\".</p> <p>In fact, Castro hardly speaks any Spanish. But that is part of what makes his vision so powerful. In the fastest-growing major city in the country, a well-heeled and mostly white audience at the Witte Museum listens to the new-generation Hispanic leader, who is aged only 38, share his plans. In doing so, he is advancing a slow-motion political takeover of Texas.</p> <p>\"San Antonio is a peek at the Texas of tomorrow and the America of tomorrow,\" Castro says. \"We've called it the new face of the American dream.\"</p> <p>2020 is, by coincidence, the projected date by which, if current trends continue, the state will come full circle. Texas, which was once part of Mexico, <a href=\"http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/tif/population.html\"> will return to being majority Hispanic</a>.</p> <p>Texas is already a state with a majority-minority population \u2013 Hispanics account for about 38% of the population but other ethnic groups push the non-white proportion to 52%. This trend has enormous potential consequences for both main political parties.</p> <p>For Republicans, such demographic change spells a possible end to their long reign in the state. The Democrats have failed to seize their opportunity \u2013 on average, <a href=\"http://www.newstaco.com/2011/05/17/how-the-latino-vote-matters-in-2012/ \">Hispanics vote 3-1 for Democrats </a> \u2013 but the state GOP has nonetheless been swerving rightward, straight into a demographic brick wall.</p> <p>Despite the fact that Texas has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976, the Republicans may see their political Alamo in San Antonio. </p> <p>\"You get California, Texas and New York,\" says Choco Meza, a former Bexar County Democratic Chair, tracing the states' geographical positions in the air, \"and that little 'v' is for 'victory'.\"</p> <p>However, Texas Democrats have yet to match action to such enthusiasm when it comes to bringing out the Hispanic vote. Unlike in California or New Mexico, Hispanics in Texas have been fighting well below their political weight. Hispanic turnout rates are poor \u2013 almost half that of white or black voters in the state. <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/socdemo/voting/publications/p20/2008/Table%2004a.xls\">In 2008 only 38% of eligible Hispanics cast ballots in the presidential election</a>.</p> <p>San Antonio incubated such landmark political Hispanic groups as the League of United Latin American Citizens and the Southwestern Voter Registration Education Project. These and other movements began in the city's Westside, the heart of its Hispanic community. There lie both the symptoms and the solutions to the political woes of Texas' Hispanics.</p> <p>This barrio region begins a few blocks away from San Antonio's bustling downtown, where tourists flock to The Alamo and the Riverwalk. In the Westside, cheap, wood-framed houses are painted salmon pink or lime green; many have clothes drying on a line. Ernest Bromley, who walked Westside's tree-lined avenues in the 1970s as a political canvasser, sees the community's symbolic divide in the appearance of such houses.</p> <p>\"There are homes that take care of themselves; a lot of home pride and flowers that are well-kept,\" Bromley says, \"and others that are just trashed. You can be poor and have a nice-looking place.\"</p> <p>Bromley, a Democrat, and his Republican business partner, Lionel Sosa, are legends in the Hispanic community, having created the first advertising firm that reached an Hispanic audience. Sosa is a master of the emotional political ad who has advised dozens of Republican campaigns \u2013 including George W Bush's 2004 run that won 49% of the Texas Hispanic vote. The tagline for that campaign was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHghAjADiXc\">\"Nos conocemos\" \u2013 \"we know each other\"</a>.</p> <p>For years, the Hispanic population in Westside was not politically engaged. As late as the 1960s, much of the area had dirt roads and a patchwork electrical service. Yearly storms created pop-up rivers that destroyed property and stranded residents. Disenchantment with the system kept turnout low, allowing such problems to fester. </p> <p>There has been some progress. From 1996 to 2008, Hispanic turnout increased by nearly 10 points and reached an all-time high for Hispanics. But the 38% turnout in the 2008 election was still <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/socdemo/voting/publications/p20/2008/Table%2004a.xls\">well below the 57% turnout among California's Hispanic population</a>.</p> <p>Castro, however, hints at something that could begin to galvanize Hispanic voters in San Antonio and beyond. \"It may come in the form of some great candidate or candidates that decide they're going to run [for governor],\" he says. \"And that's what lights up the Hispanic community.\"</p> <p>Castro swears he is not speaking of himself, though his political star is undoubtedly rising. Instead, he uses the example of his idol, Henry Cisneros. <a href=\"http://www.texasmonthly.com/preview/2001-07-01/reporter \">San Antonio's Hispanic vote doubled in 1981</a> when the striking, 6ft 3in, third-generation Mexican-American became its mayor.</p> <p>Cisneros, however, has a cautionary tale to tell. The nation's first Hispanic mayor of a major city had a rapid ascent to the national stage as part of Bill Clinton's administration, before he became embroiled in a scandal involving payoffs to a former mistress that ended his political career.</p> <p>Now a housing-policy consultant, Cisneros still lives on the Westside \u2013 in a community that he tried to modernize which is, in many ways, still stuck in the past. In the Westside, stagnation can take many forms. </p> <p>Crystal Cox, 26, returned home after earning her bachelor's degree, and found that little had changed. \"My best friend from elementary school lives across the street and she has a couple of kids,\" she says. \"It's weird to come back home and see people that I knew and they ended up just having kids and stopped with their education.\"</p> <p>Her friend follows an all too familiar and growing trend among Hispanics in Texas: <a href=\"http://hobbycenter.rice.edu/workarea/downloadasset.aspx?id=2147484251\">it is thought that by 2040, more than half will not graduate high school</a>.</p> <p>In 2011, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/12/22/144079041/texas-schools-grapple-with-big-budget-cuts\">the Republican legislature in Texas cut $4bn from public schools</a>. Party leaders argued that the state's budget had been in crisis, that cuts needed to be made, and that education spending was the largest piece of the pie.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/schools/\">a school system that is almost 50% Hispanic</a>, this was another harsh blow to the poorer districts \u2013 as well as to any Republican hopes of winning Hispanic converts.</p> <p>Even in a city as diverse as San Antonio, divides in class and race run deep. Henry Flores, dean of the Graduate School at St Mary's University and a consultant on many Democratic races, doesn't need to search too far to find remnants of a \"members only\" mindset.</p> <p>\"Take a look at the girls in that back party,\" he says, pointing to a stream of young women, dressed in their Texas best, heading to a restaurant's private room. \"You're not going to find any Latinas there.\"</p> <p>The political culture in Texas has capitalized on such small moments of division. Last year, two incendiary pieces of legislation alienated many Hispanics \u2013 one a voter ID law and the other a new district layout.</p> <p>Both have ended up in court. <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304373804577525072239849392.html\">The voter ID law required Texans to show valid state ID at the polling place</a>. The Obama administration challenged it as a violation of the Voting Rights Act, claiming that it targeted poor Hispanics without driver's licenses.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/us/final-texas-redistricting-maps-approved.html\">The new district lines contained no new electoral regions that were majority Hispanic</a>. This too went through the legal system, to arrive at a compromise of two new Hispanic and two new Anglo districts. This was a disappointment to Hispanics, considering that they have driven 65% of the state's population growth in the past decade.</p> <p>Texas was different when the Republican businessman Sosa helped George W Bush win nearly half the Hispanic vote in 2004, with a message of strong family values and a welcoming atmosphere. Now, he says he can hardly recognize the party that plays on fear of Hispanic immigration and calls, in Mitt Romney's case during the Republican primaries, for \"self-deportation\".</p> <p>\"If you look at Reagan's position on immigration and amnesty, he did it,\" Sosa says. \"It was somewhat controversial, but no big deal.\"</p> <p>But as much reason as Democrat-inclined Hispanics have to vote, there has not been a momentous shift towards the ballot box. Voter-registration groups estimate that it would take a huge \u2013 and expensive \u2013 outreach effort to register the million Hispanics who could help to turn Texas blue.</p> <p>Big-party money goes toward swing-state campaigns, rather than a more distant investment like Texas \u2013 even one that could have such a high return.</p> <p>\"Democrat voters, even in Texas, send all their money to the swing states,\" says Lydia Camarillo of the Southwestern Voter Registration Education Project. \"Trying to build up the Hispanic voter base here just isn't the way they think. If it was and they did Texas would be purple in five years.\"</p> <p>Even the most optimistic Texas Democrats have a hard time looking at the years of unfulfilled expectations without showing their frustration. The numbers are there, the future is evident, and yet the moment remains just out of reach.</p> <p>\"I've been waiting for the Hispanic sleeping giant to wake up in the 70s, the 80s, the 90s and now [the] 2000s and I've seen it in Time magazine every decade,\" Flores said. </p> <p>When will the giant wake?</p> <p>\"The answer to that question is: 'I don't know.'\"</p> <h2>Pueblo factbox</h2> <p>(All demographic data comes from the 2010 US census.

  "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States\">Prohibition in the US was a huge, miserable failure</a>. During its 13-year run, beginning in 1920, Prohibition caused a massive rise in organized crime and actually increased alcohol consumption instead of curtail it. </p> <p>After Prohibition's repeal in 1933, kids didn't start drinking in record numbers. Society didn't collapse. Today, bathtub gin dealers don't run amok on playgrounds; microbreweries don't protect their turf with automatic weapons. Instead, a safe environment to drink was created when the government began regulating and taxing alcohol. </p> <p>And yet, here we are in 2012, giving Prohibition another shot. For lack of a better word, that's just stupid. </p> <p>Today, instead of alcohol prohibition, we've got the government's harmful attempt to prohibit marijuana use. With record federal deficits and states teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, why do we insist on dumping billions of tax dollars into another failed prohibition that is accomplishing nothing other than making criminals out of millions of regular citizens and fueling drug cartels that threaten our security?</p> <p>Last year, 800,000 people were arrested in the United States for crimes associated with marijuana \u2013 and marijuana alone. It's insane to arrest people for choosing to use a natural substance that is, by any objective standard, less harmful than alcohol, a drug that is advertised at every major sporting event. Think of the strain and costs to our law enforcement, court system and prisons. And for what? Is marijuana use decreasing? No. Are cartels any less powerful and violent? I'm afraid not. Is pot difficult for minors to obtain? Nope. In fact, when polled, kids say it's easier to get marijuana than it is to get alcohol. Why? It's simple. Black market dealers don't ID. </p> <p>And yet we go around and around \u2026 trying the same methods and always getting the same terrible results. Isn't it time to try something different?</p> <p>In 1999, when I was governor of New Mexico, I began advocating for marijuana legalization. At the time, there were precious few high-ranking elected officials willing to stick out their necks for this issue. It was considered political suicide.</p> <p>Today, polls in the US show that at least 50% of Americans are now open to the idea or fully supportive of legalizing marijuana. My experience is that, the more people look at the drug issue, the more they recognize that the \"war on drugs\" is a dismal and expensive failure. It's costing more than an absurd sum of money; it's costing people their future. </p> <p>In the US, 100 million people have themselves violated our drug laws at some time or another. In fact, President Obama has readily admitted his own youthful drug use. Had he been caught and arrested, would he be president today? How many promising young people's lives and ambitions are being derailed by senseless drug laws?</p> <p>This November, voters in several states will have the opportunity to vote on marijuana legalization and medical marijuana laws. I hope the citizens of these states will carefully consider these initiatives. Once they do, I'm confident they'll give them their full support. They just make too much sense. And as more states begin to align their laws with common sense and reality, it is inevitable that the federal government will eventually follow.</p> <p>I strongly believe the tide is turning on this issue, and it's because of education and thoughtful discussion. The more we learn about marijuana and our federal government's futile and ill-advised attempt to prohibit it, the more the solution becomes clear. America will be better-off when marijuana is managed like alcohol and tobacco. Our border with Mexico will be safer, and addiction will at last be treated as the health concern it is, rather than as a criminal justice issue. </p> <p>It's truly unfortunate that President Obama doesn't see what's coming. Not only does he refuse to acknowledge the support this issue is gaining, more shockingly, he has blatantly gone back on his promise to allow states to administer their own marijuana laws. The Obama administration has shut down hundreds of state-legal medical marijuana dispensaries and is currently threatening to shut down many more.</p> <p>It's odd: when it comes to marriage rights, President Obama is quick to cede the federal government's power to the states. But when it comes to states deciding for themselves how best to tackle the marijuana issue, Obama steps right in and insists that the federal government knows best. </p> <p>I am confident American voters this November will send a signal that the time is long past that we stop putting people behind bars and forever labeling them as criminals for behavior that is personal, private, and no more \"criminal\" than drinking alcohol or taking legal pain medicine.&#xa0;</p> <p>When that signal is sent, perhaps we can put an end to modern-day Prohibition, just as we did nearly 80 years ago.</p>",
  "<p>One of Israel's leading newspapers, Maariv, is on the verge of closing, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/world/middleeast/concentration-and-politics-hobble-israels-newspapers.html\">reports the New York Times.</a> It is said to have lost its fierce contest with the country's largest seller, Yediot Aharonot. </p> <p>Another title, Haaretz - regarded as the flagship broadsheet of Israel's left-wing intelligentsia - is also under threat of closure. Last Thursday, it wasn't published for the first time in three decades after editorial staff held a one-day strike to protest at cutbacks. </p> <p>Publisher Amos Schocken responded by raised the spectre of closing the paper if his employees do not accept the business reality.</p> <p>The problems of Maariv and Haaretz are symbolic of the global print media crisis in the face of the digital revolution. But there are specific internal reasons for the dramas, most obviously the relatively small size of the Israeli media market and the fact that it is so crowded.</p> <p>That is especially true of the Hebrew-language market. Israeli media commentators argue that print media economics have been skewed by the arrival five years ago of Israel Hayom, a free national newspaper that has built up the largest weekday distribution of any Hebrew paper. </p> <p>It is owned by Sheldon Adelson, an American billionaire who is a staunch supporter of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. </p> <p>The management of Maariv is now in the hands of court-appointed trustees after its owner could no longer afford to cover its losses. A sale is pending to Shlomo Ben-Zvi, an Israeli who publishes a right-leaning newspaper called Makor Rishon.</p> <p>Even if the sale to Ben-Zvi goes through he has said he will retain only about 300 of Maariv's 2,000 employees in order to keep Maariv's website going and perhaps publish the newspaper in a limited format. </p> <p>Aware that the company does not have the money to pay all their compensation and pensions, Maariv employees have staged protests in the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.</p> <p>Though analysts claim Maariv has lost its identity by trying to mimic Yediot Aharonot, it fills a distinctive niche. \"Israel without Haaretz would be like Israel without the supreme court,\" said Uzi Benziman, a former Haaretz columnist and now editor of an online journal dealing with Israeli media issues.</p> <p>\"It is not surprising that Maariv is the first to go,\" he said. \"I'm not sure it will be the last.\"</p> <p>Maariv was founded in 1948, the year Israel became a state, by disgruntled journalists at Yediot Aharonot who walked out in a dispute over work conditions and journalistic principles. </p> <p>In its first two decades, Maariv was regarded as the most widely read newspaper in Israel and the most connected with the political, economic and social elite. </p> <p>Its decline began in the 1970s, according to Rafi Mann, who worked at the newspaper for nearly 30 years and now teaches journalism. He said the editors of Yediot Aharonot \"understood the social revolution taking place in Israel,\" while Maariv \"did not read the social map of Israel well.\"</p> <p><em>Source: </em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/world/middleeast/concentration-and-politics-hobble-israels-newspapers.html\">New York Times</a></p>",
  "<p>While giant rallies in Caracas may be drawing the world's attention ahead of Venezuelan presidential election, the global significance of the vote can be found hundreds of miles to the east in the oil-soaked Orinoco Belt.</p> <p>According to studies, Venezuela has overtaken Saudi Arabia to become number one in the world for proven oil reserves, largely thanks to the heavy crude found in this vast alluvial plain.</p> <p>Whether this multi-trillion dollar asset is controlled by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez or the opposition challenger, Henrique Capriles, will influence which countries and companies are given the priority to exploit them and how much drivers around the world pay at the pump. According to a report this year by BP, Venezuela has reserves of 296.5bn barrels, about 10% more than Saudi Arabia and 18% of the global total. At the country's current levels of production, this would last about 100 years.</p> <p>If Ch\u00e1vez wins \u2013 as most polls suggest \u2013 he has promised to ramp up production and reduce his country's dependence on the US market by doubling crude exports to Asia. To further this goal, Venezuela plans to build a pipeline through Colombia to the Pacific which would reduce costs and transport times to China and other Asian markets.</p> <p>Capriles, who has mounted a strong challenge, says he would fire the oil minister, Rafael Ram\u00edrez, and rethink how crude is extracted and used. Until now Russian and Chinese companies have struck the biggest deals for future exploitation.</p> <p>\"We have to revise every deal. I think they are agreements that are not functioning,\" he said. During the campaign, he has also said he would halt subsidised oil shipments to Cuba, Belarus, Nicaragua and Syria. Critics say he is a stalking horse for US interests.</p> <p>Both Ch\u00e1vez and Capriles are calling for more investment so that Venezuela can increase not only output but also the quality of oil through the use of upgrading technology. But the volatile mix of politics and oil has made it difficult to secure partners.</p> <p>In recent years Venezuelan oil production has fallen due to poor maintenance, low investment and the loss of key workers. Plans to open new fields have been repeatedly delayed. The state-owned oil company PDVSA says the holdups are over. Last week its joint venture with Russia's Rosneft and Lukoil pumped its first barrel. Another operation, with a Vietnamese firm, has also reportedly begun. Projects with Chevron of the US, Spain's Repsol and others are due to start early next year.</p> <p>But there are still many empty blocks. Officials said BP, Shell and several other multinationals appear to be waiting to see if the government will change today before committing to possible joint ventures in the two main areas for expansion, Carabobo and Jun\u00edn.</p> <p>\"There is a danger that British firms might miss out. In this country, oil and politics are intertwined. Many companies are waiting for the election result,\" said Osmel Molina, deputy manager of the Carabobo region. \"They hope for higher profits if the political situation changes. That's why there is so much support for the opposition. They don't necessarily want to oust Ch\u00e1vez, but they do want a weak government so they can control the biggest oil resources in the world.\"</p> <p>Venezuela has an oil-dependent economy \u2013 PDVSA accounts for 95% of the country's export earnings. Domestically, the mix of populist politics, super-abundant oil and second-rate refining technology has left the country with a peculiar system in which the state sells crude for $100 (\u00a361) a barrel, buys back petrol at $400, then sells it on to domestic drivers at such a discount that a full tank is cheaper than a cup of coffee. A gallon costs about 6p, leading to a lucrative cross-border petrol-smuggling business. Neither candidate has dared to commit to a raise.</p> <p>Oil rose to the centre of the political debate in 2003, when the sector was crippled by striking workers. The Ch\u00e1vez government, which had survived a coup attempt the previous year, sacked most of the management and many of the workers, saying that they were pawns in a US-backed effort to destabilise the country.</p> <p>The industry is now a bastion of government loyalists. Molina's office is decorated with portraits of Ch\u00e1vez and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. Most of the staff wear red Ch\u00e1vez re-election campaign T-shirts. Four oilfields are named after battles of independence.</p> <p>Oil helps to explain why Ch\u00e1vez is vilified in the US. In 2000, a year after taking power, he made his first mark on global affairs with a tour of the Middle East to lobby key Opec members \u2013 Iraq, Iran, Libya, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia \u2013 to drive oil prices higher. Since then, the cost of Brent crude has risen from less than $20 a barrel to more than $100.</p> <p>Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi were among the leaders who joined Ch\u00e1vez to drive up prices. Molina believes it is no coincidence that they were deposed and killed: \"There's a plan in place to control the global oil market. Anyone who tries to erode the monopoly ends up in conflict with the [US] empire.\"</p> <p>In the past, Molina said foreign oil firms were paying only 3% royalties to the government, but Ch\u00e1vez pushed this up to 16%. He also helped to raise the value of the output from the Orinoco Belt by relabelling it as valuable heavy crude instead of cheap bitumin or tar, as it had previously been priced.</p> <p>Some accuse the US and multinationals of trying to influence the presidential campaign. \"Transnationals want control of the oil here. They want the submission of Latin America to supply the market needs of the US,\" said Nicmer Evans, a political science professor at the Central University of Venezuela.</p> <p>But the outside influence cuts both ways. Since 2007, the government has received $42.5bn in loans from the China Development Bank, with the biggest tranche coming in the year ahead of an election in which Ch\u00e1vez has increased public spending, the minimum wage and pensions. This is repaid largely through shipments of 430,000 barrels of crude a day to China in repayment.</p> <p>Russian president Vladimir Putin showed his support with the gift of a puppy to Ch\u00e1vez this month.</p> <p>But geopolitics is not the only factor at play in deciding who gets to exploit and use this pool of oil. Geography, market demand and refining technology are also help to explain why the US \u2013 despite Ch\u00e1vez's rhetoric \u2013 remains Venezuela's biggest customer.</p> <p>The scale of the required investment will also be a struggle for any single country. Ch\u00e1vez has said Venezuela should look to the country's Faja oil belt and promised to invest $130bn in the region to double national oil production to six billion barrels a day, pushing Venezuela past Iran as the world's second-biggest producer. The money is needed to upgrade wells, processing plants, refineries, docks, roads and housing. Dire maintenance has plagued the industry, most recently with a huge fire at the Amuay refinery.</p> <p>Local people say that the main road between Morichal and Maturin has been cut off at least twice in the past month, once because floods swept away a bridge and once because of a protest by nearby residents against power shortages.</p>",
  "<h2>Steven Howell is a senior policy officer at <a href=\"http://www.localis.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Localis</a></h2> <p><strong>There is value in all sectors:</strong> It's not about ideology, it's about who has the skills and the ideas to meet the local challenge. The scale of the challenge facing public services will require a step-change in innovation and doing things differently. Local government has plenty of experience in this, but it's not going to get any easier. It's a fact that private and other sectors have had a role in service delivery for some time, and as local authorities come up with new ideas and new partnerships, diversity of provision can only increase.</p> <h2>Jonty Olliff-Cooper is director of strategy and policy at <a href=\"http://www.mya4e.com/\" title=\"\">A4e</a></h2> <p><strong>There is much more that private providers can do to open up:</strong> I am involved in a big drive to do just that at my firm, A4e. We are going to be crowdsourcing what data it is that people would like to see. However, there are two caveats:</p> <p>1. In many cases there are explicit contractual or tacit political provisions that prevent providers from being as open as they would like to be. The work programme providers are banned from releasing performance information by the department for instance.</p> <p>2. It is important to keep commercial confidentiality for some data, although not most. There is also a big cost to collecting some types of data.</p> <p><strong>Distinguish between two types of private involvement:</strong> Do we mean human or commodity services? The bulk of outsourcing over the past 30 years has been companies with an expertise in a particular type of commodity service \u2013 payroll functions, for instance \u2013 applying that expertise for public organisations. This is a much more general trend in management in all sectors, not just in public services. The newer development is including non-public sector organisations in delivering human services about meeting people's emotional needs, changing behaviour, offering care. Efficiency is really important here too, but so is ethos and quality of care.</p> <p><strong>How problems arise:</strong> Many problems in working cross-sector come when a commodity commissioning approach is taken to procuring human services: specifying process rather than what you are actually aiming for; buying on lowest cost; buying on short term contracts. The key to this is outcome commissioning, or to put it in less wonky terms, picking what it is that you care about and paying for successfully getting that.</p> <h2><strong>Councillor Peter Fleming is chair of the Local Government Association's improvement and innovation board and leader of Sevenoaks district council</strong></h2> <p><strong>The question posed could always be switched round:</strong> The private sector has done very well off the back of public sector contracts. Perhaps now is the time to redress the balance of power? The issue will come when the private sector loses interest in local government and a few of the companies leave this particular market, driving choice down and costs up and leaving those councils who have gone down the outsourcing route to re-build services themselves.</p> <h2><strong>Paul O'Brien is the chief executive of the </strong><a href=\"http://www.apse.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Association for Public Service Excellence</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>This is a fundamental time for local government:</strong> There are those who believe that councils should merely become commissioners or enablers and not provide any services. In my view this is a flawed approach. You need to retain capacity and capability if you want to be influential and a steward on behalf of local communities. The public policy challenges we face are horrendous, protecting local economies, youth unemployment, welfare reform, housing need, tackling climate change. If local government becomes so emasculated of capacity that it merely stands aside and watches as others force market solutions on communities then it will have failed.</p> <h2><strong>Abigail Lock is the head of external relations for </strong><a href=\"http://www.mearsgroup.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Mears</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Procurement processes can be a barrier:</strong> This is the case for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as larger companies. Processes vary from place to place, but they demand a great deal of time, resource and expertise from businesses and the voluntary sector. We need to ensure that there is a rigour within the process and that it achieves value for money, but current systems do not always do this.</p> <h2><strong>Ian Gillespie is chief executive of </strong><a href=\"http://www.vanguardhealthcare.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Vanguard Healthcare Solutions</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>It needs to be a collaborative effort:</strong> Whoever delivers services, they need to do so in an efficient and cost effective manner. To do this they need great people, and openness to new ideas and collaborations. They also need some freedom to innovate. Progress has been made over the last 10 years, but there are still some challenges ahead if we are to deliver world class outcomes and services from our taxes. Wholesale outsourcing tends to lead to abdication of responsibility and accountability.</p> <h2><strong>Edward Davie is a Labour councillor at the </strong><a href=\"http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/home.htm\" title=\"\"><strong>London borough of Lambeth</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>A healthy balance between public, private and third sectors:</strong> The problem comes when there is an ideological bias in favour of the private sector in particular. Professor Nick Black nailed the myth of declining NHS productivity, and the Commonwealth Fund found it to be the most efficient health system in the west, when the coalition government was trying to argue that it was the opposite so they could open it up to the private sector. In Lambeth, our largely publicly provided children's services were recently found by Ofsted to be the best in England and our \"unfree\" schools have improved beyond recognition thanks to sensible public sector co-ordination across the borough.</p> <h2><strong>Henry Stannard is a consultant at </strong><a href=\"http://www.occstrategy.nl/\" title=\"\"><strong>OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>So many failed contracts are an example of poor procurement:</strong> The first cuts local authorities have made have been in the more commercial areas of middle and senior management \u2013 safeguarding the front line \u2013 meaning that when it comes to delivering a second wave of savings through transforming services, the expertise required to do so is not there.</p> <h2><strong>Denise Le Gal is cabinet member for change and efficiency at </strong><a href=\"http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Surrey county council</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Local government must build commercial expertise: </strong>Councils must develop the internal market expertise to assess the right length and structure of their procurements. These contacts also need the flexibility so they can be effectively market tested and benchmarked. Our contracts have moved from being too rigorously specified to an outcomes based approach, particularly within our social care environment. This has fostered more innovative proposals from suppliers allowing them to demonstrate their real expertise and flexibility in a market rather than simply responding to a requirement that constrains them.</p> <p><strong>Share procurement with a neighbouring authority: </strong>This has generated massive savings to both authorities and increasingly will allow us to pool our resources. On a broader note, just about all of our procurements are now collaborative either with district, borough or private partners. Furthermore we have established regional procurement for highways which includes seven counties. That's progress.</p> <h2><strong>Tim Manning is a </strong><a href=\"http://design4services.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>freelance business architect</strong></a><strong> and service designer</strong></h2> <p><strong>Methods and techniques for service design have advanced:</strong> Private sector suppliers typically seek to reduce costs through a mechanism of standardisation, automation (through 'big IT'), specialisation (to reduce labour costs) and scale. This is essentially the mass production model of Adam Smith and Henry Ford. But people are not pins. The argument is that these delivery models can actually lead to increased costs, as they are unable to absorb the variation in demand that naturally exists when dealing with the individual needs of people.What's required is an approach that designs the service against the social system to which it forms a part. One that delivers services that are joined-up, flexible and agile. This represents a major challenge for the private sector.</p> <p><em>You can read the discussion </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/oct/02/live-discussion-public-sector-private-investment\" title=\"\"><em>in full here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Since the carefully and successfully choreographed outing of Welsh rugby ace Gareth Thomas there has been a slow but steady drip-feed of sportsmen following his lead. Not all of them will be given the plaudit of a Hollywood biopic pitch, but each has added a layer to the snowball of sporting inclusivity. A Swedish footballer, an English cricketer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/04/orlando-cruz-boxer-announce-gay\" title=\"\">and now Puerto Rican featherweight boxer Orlando Cruz</a> have made their own minor splashes.</p> <p>In each news item the spectre of the ghost of gay sports' past, Justin Fashanu, has been evoked and woven through the reportage. At each point the reference of implicit tragedy has felt less relevant.</p> <p>Here's the thing. Where there are groups of men involved in close physical contact, there will likely be some sort of gay attraction, both covert and overt. It is no big reveal. There is something in \"the sound, the smell and the spray\", <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UANBdod8Nuk\" title=\"\">as Morrissey sang in Boxers</a>. Christopher Isherwood wrote in detail of the playful wrestling he exchanged for foreplay in his LA years memoirs. The squashed noses and split lips of Bruce Weber's hyper-masculine photography have wrought art from the erotic subtext of boxing. Reggie Kray sitting ringside at Bethnal Green boxing meets held its own special subtext, spelt out in riveting emotional detail in Jake Arnott's underworld thriller, The Long Firm, and the opening frames of The Long Good Friday.</p> <p>So being surprised that a gay boxer exists is a little like being surprised that gay activity exists in prisons, the army or boarding school dormitories. The sliding scale of testosterone exchange is a broad, welcoming and sometimes titillating church. Long before Orlando Cruz joined the burgeoning league of elite gay sportsfolk, boxing had transparent gay heat. The story of the writer who entered the changing room of 1960s welterweight champ Emile Griffiths and found him kissing his cornerman cannot be isolated.</p> <p>Perhaps it is time to stop seeing these personal stories as exceptional, standalone news items and start looking at the wider culture around them. When I heard about Cruz's decision to declare his sexuality, I could map out a familiar pattern \u2013 the placebo Stonewall award, the gay magazine cover, a couple of appropriate grooming sponsorships, perhaps even a minor ruckus with a fellow sportsman. Not to diminish his story, Cruz's was in the recent succession of Ricky Martin's page-break in the Catholic dialogue still dominating Latin cultures. The interesting aspect of his story is not sporting but cultural and religious. How gay firsts in sport are yet to come? Should we steady ourselves for the grand reveal of the first openly gay darts player? Actually, that would be kind of genius. Boxing has always been hardwired to underworld glamour, pristine routine and the thrill of controlled, regimented touch.</p> <p>Each of these individual sporting narratives has accrued an emblematic momentum outside of the weight of its own significance. It is time for institutional acknowledgement and acceptance to lessen the drama. And we may be closer than we think.</p> <p>It was the gentlemanly Italian national football manager Cesare Prandelli who most prominently shot the obvious undertones of homosexuality and sport into the wider world. Earlier this year the author Alessandro Cecchi Paone asked Prandelli to furnish him with a forward for his book The Champion of Love: The Banned Games of Sport, a work <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jun/13/euro-2012-italy-antonio-cassano-homophobia\" title=\"\">hinting at a gay slant to the Azzuri</a>. Prandelli returned the request with a wonderful, liberating missive, making him the first global spokesman to hint at an institutional urgency for modernisation to match the personal narratives of individual sportsmen.</p> <p>\"In the world of football and of sport in general,\" he wrote, \"there is still a taboo around homosexuality. Everyone ought to live freely with themselves, their desires and their sentiments. We must all work for a sporting culture that respects the individual in every manifestation of his truth and freedom. Hopefully soon players will come out.\"</p> <p>In 2012 there should be no surprise that gay men excel at sport. The personal stories of gay sportsmen are just a natural manifestation of the homo-friendly subtext of men touching each other professionally. It is the wider bodies that organise, police and monetise these sportsmen that need to sort out an arena in which comings out of Orlando Cruz's type do not necessitate breaking news. The lead to follow here is not Gareth Thomas's, as fantastic as that was, but Cesare Prandelli's.</p>"
