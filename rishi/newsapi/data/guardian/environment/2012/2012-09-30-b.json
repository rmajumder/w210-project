  "<p>A newly elected Labour government would seek to close the multibillion-pound hole in Britain's defence budget by imposing an unprecedented 10-year programme that would be subject to annual independent oversight.</p> <p>In one of the first examples of Labour's new \"ruthless\" approach to spending, the shadow defence secretary, Jim Murphy, will on Monday outline detailed plans to address the perennial problem of escalating defence costs. Murphy, who went out on a limb earlier this year when he pledged to accept \u00a35bn of the government's defence cuts, will pledge to impose Whitehall's first 10-year rolling budget assessed independently every year by the National Audit Office.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian before his speech to the Labour conference, Murphy said any cost overruns would have to be funded out of the MoD budget, although in emergencies the Treasury could be asked to help. The new approach is designed to end the practice, followed by governments of all colours, known as \"pushing to the right\". This describes the process in which costs that cannot be met from the MoD's annual budget are pushed forward even though extra funds are not available.</p> <p>He wants to end what he calls the Mastermind \"I've started so I'll finish\" approach to spending. \"This is an effort to change the architecture and culture of the MoD budget. It is real-time scrutiny, forensic and independent assessment of a 10-year MoD budget. We are determined to add discipline and rigour to defence spending.\"</p> <p>The Tories claimed after the last election that the Labour government had bequeathed a \u00a338bn 10-year hole by signing up to unaffordable defence projects. These were funded by rolling the costs forward, creating a deficit in the MoD budget.</p> <p>Murphy disputes the \u00a338bn figure, a point reinforced in his mind when the new defence secretary, Philip Hammond, announced the gap in the budget had been closed in double-quick time. But Murphy accepts Labour was, in common with previous governments, guilty of the practice of \"pushing to the right\" on spending. He says Hammond has not ended it, citing the new Astute class of submarines which have added \u00a3200m to the defence budget as costs are pushed forward.</p> <p>\"As a rule, for any increases in spending we would have to identify savings elsewhere in the ten year programme.</p> <p>\"We would deal with increases in the Astute costs, for example, by making savings either further down the line or to another programme. We will not tolerate an imbalance between the order book and what we can afford.\"</p> <p>Murphy said this is not a new problem. \"Successive governments have seen this as a way to make quick savings today and to delay tough decisions. The government are repeating these old mistakes. We want to end the culture of pushing to the right, doing so only where essential for technical or strategic reasons and ensuring actions are affordable and accountable.</p> <p>\"There have been huge cost overruns in, for example, the Typhoon project. But remember this was first envisaged by Michael Heseltine. We are still debating these cost overruns and how to deal with them.\"</p> <p>Murphy believes there is a compelling political and fiscal need for restraint because the structural budget deficit will not have been eliminated by the next election in 2015. He says his plans, which have been approved by Ed Balls, build on the shadow chancellor's pledge to adopt a ruthless approach to spending by imposing tough zero-based budgeting on Whitehall.</p> <p>But Murphy also believes that a series of expensive defence spending commitments after the next election require strict discipline. He agrees with Sir Nick Harvey, the former Liberal Democrat defence minister, who told the Guardian last week that Britain faced a \"perfect storm\" of defence capital costs in 2020. These include building the new joint strike fighter aircraft and Type 26 frigates, amphibious craft for the navy and a new global combat ship.</p> <p>His first act as defence secretary would be to hold a strategic defence and security review to assess how to tailor the military to Britain's needs on the world stage.</p> <p>This would then be followed by extending the core equipment programme (CEP) to cover 10 years. This would be assessed in the annual planning round. This in turn would be vetted by the NAO and Murphy would report to parliament. The rolling process means that the first planning round would examine the years 2015-25. The second assessment would be for 2016-26.</p> <p>While Murphy praised Harvey for warning of a \"perfect storm\" of costs, he is yet to be convinced of the need to scrap Britain's immediate and permanent nuclear deterrent when Trident reaches the end of its life. He will wait for the outcome of the Trident replacement review, launched by Harvey, though Labour would be wary of ending Britain's \"continuous at sea\" deterrent provided by a fleet of submarines.</p> <p>Hammond said: \"Labour are still in denial over the catastrophic mess they left in defence. Wiping out the black hole inherited from the last government has allowed us to award contracts worth millions of pounds, thereby sustaining thousands of British jobs.</p> <p>\"In contrast, Labour still refuse to accept the financial black hole they left behind and the tough decisions this Government has taken to balance the defence budget. It just shows that Labour isn't learning. The MoD now has a fully-funded equipment programme with a planned \u00a3160bn spend on kit and support over the next ten years, including \u00a35.5bn on new and upgraded armoured vehicles.</p> <p>\"It's time Jim Murphy and Labour accepted that they left the defence programme and budget in a shambles, and started doing what is right for the Armed Forces.\"<strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>Fleet Street has become an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2009/jul/24/news-agencies-sun\" title=\"\">anachronism for the newspaper industry</a>. The fear is that the media's capacity for investigative reporting, in an era of plunging revenues and an uncertain digital future, becomes similarly outmoded.</p> <p>Mark Watts is on a mission to reverse this. The geographical bit he has already accomplished; his investigative news website, Exaro, is run out of offices in Fetter Lane, a stone's throw from Fleet Street's famous El Vino wine bar where the great and the good of the industry once gathered.</p> <p>The second bit \u2013 generating enough paying subscribers for the site to break even within three years of launch \u2013 will be more difficult. <a href=\"http://www.exaronews.com/\" title=\"\">Exaro</a> \u2013 Latin for \"plough\" or \"dig up\" \u2013 is bankrolled by the millionaire investment fund manager Jerome Booth (worth a reputed \u00a3189m). Watts, a former journalist at the defunct Sunday Business, is editor-in-chief.</p> <p>\"Raising any significant revenue is clearly challenging in this environment in which most consumers expect to get information and news material online for free,\" says Watts.</p> <p>\"But the challenges are not insurmountable. We don't need enormous revenues to make the thing work.\"</p> <p>Exaro bills itself as \"holding power to account\" at a time when mainstream media, says Watts, has lost its appetite for investigative journalism.</p> <p>\"There was an increasing feeling both in broadcasting and in newspapers that it wasn't worth the resources, that it takes too much time and money and the readership was not that interested,\" he says. There are exceptions, however, notably the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\" title=\"\">Guardian's phone-hacking revelations</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/\" title=\"\">Daily Telegraph's MPs' expenses scoop</a>.</p> <p>\"It hasn't died,\" says Watts. \"But most journalists spend their time rewriting press releases and wire copy. Our aim is to develop an investigative site which is producing material for which people are prepared to pay.\"</p> <p>One year old this month, Exaro has scored some notable scoops, including the <a href=\"http://davidhencke.wordpress.com/2012/03/22/how-the-student-loan-tax-scandal-broke/\" title=\"\">revelation that the head</a> of the Student Loans Company, Ed Lester, avoided paying thousands of pounds in income tax, leading to a wholesale review of the tax affairs of public officials.</p> <p>The site has a core staff of half a dozen, including the former Guardian Westminster correspondent David Hencke, who broke the Lester story, out of about 35 contributing journalists. Watts says it as an \"incredibly lean operation\".</p> <p>The site is free \u2013 although users have to register \u2013 with plans to introduce its first subscription element in the next few weeks. Initially the price will be heavily discounted, with breaking news stories remaining free of charge.</p> <p>Watts is aiming at an audience of professionals \u2013 he lists lawyers, accountants, bankers, senior civil servants \u2013 for whom paying for content online (ft.com, for instance) is not anathema.</p> <p>It has teamed up with rival media outlets (such as BBC2's Newsnight) to give stories a bigger shop window and send the Exaro name out into the ether.</p> <p>\"If you were to do a cuts check on the number of times we have been mentioned in the national newspapers, it's an astonishing number for a tiny outfit that sprung up a year ago,\" says Watts. The Guardian's national newspaper archive counts 31.</p> <p>But he admits: \"If you stopped the average person, even in the City, the proportion of people that would have heard of us won't be as high as we need it to be in the long run.\"</p> <p>Exaro was the product of a small team that included Tim Pendry, who also runs the PR company TPPR and the media finance specialist David Baxter, who is the firm's chief executive and worked at BSkyB. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LckL-eufErM\" title=\"\">Booth, head of research</a> at <a href=\"http://www.ashmoregroup.com/\" title=\"\">Ashmore Investment Management</a>, was the first person they approached to fund it.</p> <p>Unlike the seemingly similar operations <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/\" title=\"\">ProPublica</a> in the US or the UK's <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/\" title=\"\">Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>, which rely on philanthropy for funding, Booth wants his money back and more. \"He is someone who has invested in the business and is hoping at the end of the day to get a return on it,\" says Watts.</p> <p>But he declines to say how much Booth has invested, or what price the site will charge users. Nor will he talk traffic numbers, either current or target.</p> <p>Annual running costs are off limits as well. \"I'm not going to get into that because I don't know off the top of my head. I just know the editorial spend is modest in relation to the output.\" The site puts up an average of about four new stories a week.</p> <p>Watts began his career at the Hull Daily Mail, specialising in investigative reporting, before getting his national newspaper break on the Sunday Express. After a foray into television, including working on ITV's long-defunct World in Action, he joined Andrew Neil's Sunday Business, from which he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jun/07/pressandpublishing.citynews\" title=\"\">won just under \u00a36,000 in damages</a> after suing for unfair dismissal in 2002.</p> <p>Watts was dismissed after sending two emails complaining about the dismantling of the paper's investigative unit, which he headed. \"They fired me for writing these two memos which they called 'gross misconduct',\" he remembers. \"It was a ridiculous thing to say and from my point of view it was about clearing that slur.\"</p> <p>He went on to present a daily newspaper review show on the Iran-backed TV channel Press TV. The news channel has since had its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/20/iran-press-tv-loses-uk-licence\" title=\"\">licence to broadcast in the UK revoked</a> by the media regulator, Ofcom, after, among other things, broadcasting an interview with an imprisoned Newsweek journalist obtained under duress.</p> <p>\"The programme I did was as presenter and executive producer, I had clear editorial control,\" says Watts. \"There were other things going on at the channel, mostly not from the London bureau, that were outrageous. That all postdates my time there.\"</p> <p>Watts left after it was suggested his contract was changed to remove the executive producer role. \"I saw that as a precursor to removing my editorial control over the programme, which would be unacceptable.\"</p> <p>One former colleague describes Watts as \"a very serious-minded, slightly awkward character, verging on the obsessional, who is totally convinced of the importance of what he does. He's not a laugh-a-minute kind of guy. He collects admiration rather than friendships.\"</p> <p>Watts's 2005 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Fleet-Street-Sewer-Rat/dp/1903906156\" title=\"\">The Fleet Street Sewer Rat</a>, exposed some of the \"dark arts\" of British newspapers including \"bin raiding\": going through the dustbins of celebrities, their lawyers and accountants, famously practised by Benji \"the Binman\" Pell.</p> <p>\"I was very conscious at the time that everyone was saying 'I can't believe you are going to spill the beans, this is like <em>omert\u00e0</em>, you keep this stuff secret,'\" says Watts.</p> <p>He says he was aware of phone hacking but \"focused specifically on bin raiding because I had lots of very good source material on that, whereas phone hacking, all I knew was what people in the industry were telling me about it, I didn't have any documents.\"</p> <p>Of the conclusions of the Leveson inquiry, due next month, Watts warns: \"There are real dangers in what will flow from Leveson.</p> <p>\"I do think there will be all sorts of people in positions of power clamouring to introduce mechanisms that will shackle journalists in one way or another, but it remains to be seen.</p> <p>\"It's healthy that we've learned about newspaper practices, as someone who started revealing them a long time ago, and it's healthy that other things have been flushed out beyond what newspapers get up to. Exactly what will flow from it, I think we should all be on our guard.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government's failure to tackle climate change is \"reckless and short-sighted\" with just 50 months remaining to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/16/ipcc-sea-level-rise-temperatures#start-of-comments\" title=\"\"> prevent a critical threshold in the fight against global warming being breached</a>, environmental campaigners warn today.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/01/50-months-tackle-climate-change\" title=\"\">letter to the Guardian</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/sep/30/50-months-climate-change\" title=\"\">expanded on in an article in G2</a>, they say global warming remains one of the greatest threats to human progress but condemn the fact it has dropped down the political agenda.

The UK and the EU have set the 2C mark as a line the world should not cross.</p> <p>\"There is so much to gain from investing with speed and scale in a modern, low-carbon economy, that the failure to do so appears both reckless and short-sighted,\" the letter says. \"Some recent policies seem even to take us backwards.

Ruth Bond, chairwoman of the National Federation of Women's Institutes, will try to give every child practical skills such as cooking to tackle obesity and instil the value of food, and growing food, which gives them an appreciation of the natural environment.</p> <p>John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace , has committed to more direct action to protect the Arctic from oil drilling, while Westwood said there was a need to inflame public opinion and blame politicians for the crisis.</p> <p>The letter urges politicians to say what they will do \"to grab the opportunity of action and prevent catastrophic climate change\".</p> <p><strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>This year has seen a record loss of sea ice, and greenhouse gas concentrations above the Arctic at their highest point for possibly 800,000 years. Crop-wrecking droughts and record temperatures have scorched the US midwest.

  "<p>The government's \"green deal\" scheme, intended to give householders a environmental makeover, launches on Monday without any of the country's large retailers signed up \u2013 despite a promise that they would play a central role in offering the deal to consumers.</p> <p>Major retailers such as supermarkets and DIY stores are viewed as essential to the success of the scheme as they are trusted by customers and have the necessary reach to cover the population.</p> <p>But none is ready to join the launch, with several telling the Guardian they would \"wait and see\" how the scheme worked out before making a final decision whether to support it.</p> <p>B&amp;Q, which has been courted by ministers, said it was \"finalising its position\", while Tesco said it already offered a range of energy efficiency options independently of the \"green deal\" and Marks &amp; Spencer said it was waiting for more details.</p> <p>The John Lewis Partnership told the Guardian: \"We have not made a decision on whether this is a commercial opportunity for us, but are interested to see how the market and legislation develop over the coming months.\" Sainsbury said it was interested, but was likely to make any plans for an offering through British Gas.</p> <p>The absence of large retailers from the launch lineup underlines the difficulties and confusion that have surrounded the scheme, which has faced a barrage of criticism from experts who have warned it will be too complex and could disadvantage poorer people.</p> <p>Under the scheme, households will be able to sign up for improvements such as insulation and renewable energy installation, paid for through loans that are paid back by additions to their energy bills. The loans are attached to the property, so future buyers will have to pay for past improvements, but the repayments should be offset by energy savings.</p> <p>Ministers are urgently considering how to give people a financial incentive to sign up to the deal. Officials have been working for months on a system of cashback incentives that could amount to \u00a3200m, but final details have not yet been settled, in part because of the complexity. Any incentive would have to be capped per household, at a level still not decided.</p> <p>Charles Yates, associate director at professional services network Grant Thornton, said the failure to get big-name retailers on board from the launch highlighted the problems and delays that have beset the scheme.</p> <p>\"Their brand is very important to them, they protect it zealously. If they thought [the scheme] was robust enough to get involved, it would be a big vote of confidence \u2013 the fact that they are not shows we are still not there yet.\"</p> <p>He said getting retailers on board would be crucial. \"The M&amp;Ss of this world could be very powerful advocates, these are very trusted brands. It would be a very positive sign to see a big advertising campaign \u2013 this is not just the green deal, it is the M&amp;S green deal.\"</p> <p>Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, said he was \"very alarmed\" by the delays in setting up the scheme. But he added the possibility of using council tax deductions as an incentive was still under consideration. \"If that emerges too, you're starting to build a package that will change the whole atmosphere of gloom around the green deal,\" he said.</p> <p>The Department of Energy and Climate Change said more companies were expected to sign up to offer the scheme to their customers within the next few months.</p> <p>From Monday, householders will be able to register to have their home assessed for green deal improvements. Accredited inspectors will give advice on efficiency measures ranging from loft insulation, typically costing no more than about \u00a3200, to double glazing and the far more expensive solid wall insulation, which can cost more than \u00a37,000 for a typical home.</p> <p>But people will have to wait until 28 January for work to start on any improvements, and for loans to be approved. This phased introduction allows ministers to fulfil their promise of launching the scheme this autumn, while giving companies additional time to design their offers and put the means in place to deliver them.</p> <p>Ministers want large and small companies to get involved, ranging from household names down to one-man-band builders. They see this as a way to create jobs while cutting emissions and helping people lower their energy bills.</p> <p>But the consumer watchdog Which? warned consumers must be protected from \"dodgy\" practitioners who might try to take advantage of the complexities of the system. Richard Lloyd, its executive director, said: \"We will be watching closely to see if people get ripped off. Any poor practice must be stamped out as quickly as possible.\"</p> <p>Other concerns have focused on the cost of the loans. The Green Alliance thinktank has calculated that if loans are made at commercial rates of interest homeowners may wait for years or never see a payback. Poverty campaigners said poorer and more vulnerable people could lose out, as they are less able to access loans and would be put off by the additions to their energy bills.</p> <p>One study found the rate of takeup could be lower than for previous schemes to improve energy efficiency as consumers were confused by the complexity of working out interest rates and likely savings.</p> <p>The Federation of Small Businesses warned small businesses were likely to reap \"very little benefit\" from the deal, as \"potential cost savings are eaten up by rising energy bills\".</p> <p>Yates said much was still unclear about the scheme. \"I suspect it will start off rather slowly,\" he said. \"There are so many questions around takeup and what investment will be needed from the private sector \u2013 an awful lot of businesses just see so many uncertainties on key issues, like the availability of finance. Companies have been hanging back. We are keen that it should work, but we're not quite sure yet.\"</p>",
  "<p>A Labour-led alliance of entrepreneurs, academics and trade unionists will be announced on Mondayin an initiative to tackle youth unemployment in Britain's 10 worst-hit areas.</p> <p>Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary, will tell the conference that the group, Labour's Youth Jobs Taskforce, will monitor government policy. It will also aim to help MPs and councils set up job summits and create a network of councillors to swap ideas on employing young jobless people.</p> <p>The body, which will also include an executive from the accountancy giant KPMG, is meant to show Labour putting forward a serious plan to tackle unemployment, in contrast to the government's policy which has been criticised for being lacklustre by a committee of MPs. Byrne will speak to conference live from a youth jobs summit in Manchester to launch the taskforce.</p> <p>\"Britain's youth jobs crisis can't wait for a Labour government in 2015. We have to take action today. So Labour's leaders from across the country are today uniting in a new drive to give the best thing we can give to our young people: a chance to work,\" he will say.</p> <p>\"The Tory-led government's measures have failed. Across the UK, it's now Labour leading the fight-back against the curse of youth unemployment. Our task is to make sure the best ideas anywhere become Labour's approach everywhere.\"</p> <p>It is a year since youth unemployment rose above a million for the first time since records began. Around 40% of unemployed people in the UK are aged 16-25.</p> <p>Labour has accused ministers of a U-turn for scrapping the previous government's future jobs fund and then introducing its own youth jobs initiative, the youth contract.</p> <p>Whitehall officials point out that the future jobs fund placed people in the public sector or community organisations and that they did not always learn marketable skills.</p> <p>By contrast, the youth contract is aimed at private sector opportunities. The aim is to match people up with employers who might go on to offer them real jobs.</p> <p>The drawback is that it depends on the willingness of private sector companies to step forward.</p> <p>Byrne will chair the taskforce which will also include Alan Buckle, the global deputy chairman of KPMG, the chief executive of Daylesford Organic, and representatives from Unison and the TUC.</p> <p>Prof Paul Gregg, a former member of the CBI's steering committee, has also agreed to join, Labour said.</p> <p>The launch comes as Labour local authorities demand new powers from the government under the City Deal programme to tackle youth unemployment. Some councils have prepared bids to the \u00a3100m Big Lottery Talent Match fund designed to finance youth jobs initiatives.</p> <p>In June, the Cabinet Office and the Department for Work and Pensions calculated the 20 worst areas for youth unemployment in the country, all of them in the north of England, Scotland and Wales.</p>",
  "<p>\"The more I think about it the more I am convinced that time is the thing. How we use time - and how we can use it differently.</p> <p>We are all so busy, aren't we? That is, the lucky ones with paid jobs and families and agendas crowded with obligations and ambitions? We're in the fast lane, whooshing through life as though it were a ... but forget the metaphor, we haven't time to ponder on that.</p> <p>So, there are two things to do. One is to slow down and think carefully about what really matters in our lives \u2013 and change our daily habits accordingly. The other is to do everything in our power to make sure that this is not a privilege for the comfortable elite.</p> <p>If we weren't so busy all the time, we could do a lot to shrink our carbon footprint. Walk and cycle instead of going by car. Take a train or even a boat instead of an aeroplane. Give up on convenience gadgets and processed ready meals. Repair things instead of chucking them out and buying new ones. Buy less stuff.</p> <p>We could do a lot to make our lives more enjoyable. Spend more time with people we care about. Dance, paint, build, read, run, play, think, listen, watch, learn, invent, create. Make the world a better place. Get to know the neighbours, get to grips with politics, get active, get out on the streets. Our democracy depends on everyone having time to play a part. And look what a sorry state it's in.</p> <p>All this depends on using time differently. For starters, those of us with reasonably well-paid jobs could cut our hours. The new economics foundation has called for 21 hours as the new standard working week. We argue that it will be good for the environment, for society and for the economy too.</p> <p>Think about it. Here we are, busy Guardian readers working all hours to bring home the carbon-intensive bacon. And there are more than 2.5 million people who can't get jobs at all. So share out the opportunities. If we love work so much that we want to do more, we should still be free to choose. But why expect to be paid for the extra hours, when others aren't paid at all?</p> <p>Oh no, you cry! I couldn't make ends meet if I didn't work 40-odd hours a week. I wouldn't have enough to live on. But how much is enough? Some of us have far more than enough. We've got so much stuff we can't fit it into our homes (self-storage units are a huge, booming business). Yet there are many who can't feed the family even by working around the clock.</p> <p>If we privileged ones cut our paid working hours, we'd have more time to take action against low pay, poverty and inequality. So that's where I think we should be heading in the next 50 months. And my personal resolution?

This level matters because beyond it an environmental \"domino effect\" is likely to operate. In a volatile and unpredictable dynamic, things like melting ice, and the release of carbon from the planet's surface <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/05/climate-change-feedback-loops\" title=\"\">are set to feed off each other</a>, accelerating and reinforcing the warming effect.</p> <p>The time frame follows an estimate of risk of rising greenhouse gas concentrations from the world's leading authority on climate change, <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\" title=\"\">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),</a> that passed a certain point, it will no longer be \"likely\" that we stay the right side of the line. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/01/cancun-climate-talks-island-states-sea-levels\" title=\"\">Some consider even a 2C rise too much</a>, but it is the limit that the EU and others have signed up to.</p> <p>Extraordinarily, however, in spite of the stakes, the issue has receded from the political frontline like a wave shrinking down a beach.

Politicians may have turned their backs, others have not.</p> <p>Here's what a broad selection of groups and individuals who range from the Women's Institute to Oxfam and Margaret Thatcher's former environmental adviser, say in an open letter published in the Guardian today to the coalition government and opposition:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"This year has seen the record loss of sea ice, and greenhouse gas concentrations above the Arctic at their highest point for possibly 800,000 years. Crop-wrecking droughts and record temperatures have scorched the American Mid-West.\"</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>But, to our dismay, climate change and the weather volatility it fuels have fallen far down the political agenda when it needs to be at the top. It remains, however, one of the greatest threats to human progress, and tackling it is a huge economic opportunity</p> </blockquote> <p>They call on both the coalition and Labour to spell out what they will do differently in the next 50 months to prevent a climate catastrophe.</p> <p>Individually some go further.

  "<p>There was no great frustration to Sergio Ag\u00fcero's assessment \u2013 his outlook born more of an acceptance that this is simply one reality of the modern global game \u2013 yet an issue was still there to be highlighted. The Argentinian is in his second season in the Premier League after five years in Spain, and so spoke with authority when suggesting that homegrown players benefit from a privilege not afforded to foreign imports by domestic referees.</p> <p>The point was delivered in the aftermath of a timely win, not resentfully following a defeat but in a climate where players who are perceived to tumble too easily under challenges find themselves increasingly under scrutiny. Ag\u00fcero's Manchester City team had two appeals for a penalty turned down on Saturday when Carlos Tevez and Pablo Zabaleta were floored in the area, but neither incident felt overly significant given that the visitors still emerged victorious. Liverpool's Luis Su\u00e1rez has drawn more of the focus in recent times, as he did at Carrow Road this weekend, yet the champions are clearly conscious of the debate.</p> <p>Asked if foreign players find life harder than English players in the Premier League when it came to officials' decisions, Ag\u00fcero was clear. \"Yes. Always,\" he said. \"But it happens everywhere [in the world]. There is a little bit of privilege with players who come from that country. That is normal. We just play our game, and the referee's job is to know who is tricking him and who is not.\"</p> <p>The City manager, Roberto Mancini, may have referred to Peter Crouch's recent goal for Stoke, where the forward used his hand to control the bouncing ball before converting, when bemoaning previous ill-fortune amid a \"difficult\" run of results, but Ag\u00fcero's observations did not reflect a sense of grievance simmering at City.</p> <p>Rather, his was a general observation on playing in alien surroundings. Are referees innately suspicious of foreign players? \"Maybe, yes,\" said the striker. \"It can happen, but I don't think it did here [at Craven Cottage]. If it does, it's not good for anyone. Here in England, there are almost as many foreign players as English players and it's not right that some have a privilege that others don't.\"</p> <p>There was an irony that the only penalty awarded here was soft, and granted to a Norwegian in John Arne Riise after Zabaleta's slight tug. No team in the top flight can match the 14 nationalities Fulham have utilised in the Premier League to date this season, and yet Mladen Petric was still able to convert the spot-kick with ease to suggest City's recent sloppy form might be maintained.</p> <p>The real privilege on view, however, was the depth in quality of the visitors' options. Ag\u00fcero had equalised just before the break but Mancini still flung a mouth-watering array of attacking talent into the fray to register a first win in five attempts, ending with six forward-thinkers and two full-backs ever eager to charge ahead. Their second-half dominance of the ball was rewarded late with Edin Dzeko's emphatic winner.</p> <p>All four of City's main strikers \u2013 Ag\u00fcero, Dzeko, Tevez and Mario Balotelli \u2013 played for a period. \"We have four forwards with a good attitude \u2013 maybe Mario sometimes so-so \u2013 but they're all good players,\" said Mancini. \"It's difficult to put one or two on the bench but when they come on they can change a result, like today.\" Dzeko's goals in the campaign's early weeks might persuade the management to include him against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday for a match City will feel they must win to inject momentum into their European quest.</p> <p>Fulham's own forward inspiration, Dimitar Berbatov, was absent here \u2013 and will be against Southampton on Sunday as he recovers from a thigh injury. \"Someone told me Dimitar had played 10 times against City and had lost only once,\" said Martin Jol ruefully. \"He has the qualities that can make a difference against a team like that, and that had given me confidence earlier in the week. So that was disappointing. But I still expected a bit more from my team. We looked as if we were playing for a point, and you can't do that at home.\" Their own improvement is ongoing, their resistance actually admirable until they were punctured late on. Both these teams will feel they are merely warming up.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> David Silva (Manchester City)</p>",

  "<p>The government is to unveil blueprints for a new generation of shrunken schools and has told builders they will be about 15% smaller than those built during Labour's spending boom.</p> <p>Corridors, assembly halls, canteens and atriums will be squeezed under the proposals, expected this week, which will set the template for 261 replacement school buildings to be erected over the next five years at a cost of \u00a32.5bn.</p> <p>The tough space standards will be introduced to help hugely reduce costs in the coalition's delayed programme to replace the country's most run-down primary and secondary schools.</p> <p>The average price of each school is expected to be \u00a37m less than under the previous government's \u00a355bn Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme, which won architectural awards but was cancelled in 2010 by the education secretary, Michael Gove, amid criticism of soaring costs and delays.</p> <p>Some teachers and architects have voiced concern that the squeeze could cause pupil congestion in corridors, potentially leading to poorer discipline and bullying. They have also warned that smaller assembly halls could undermine attempts to maximise the value for money of school buildings by making them available for community functions after hours.</p> <p>Others have welcomed the pared-down approach, saying that millions of pounds were wasted under the previous programme on unnecessary consultant fees and extravagant design statements that could have been spent on teaching.</p> <p>\"If you have shares in atriums, sell,\" said Peter Lauener, chief executive of the government's Education Funding Agency, which has drawn up the \"baseline designs\" that are expected to be unveiled this week. Designers and builders vying for contracts will be expected to use the designs as a starting point.</p> <p>\"More for less is the theme of what we are trying to do with education capital,\" Lauener said. \"We are looking to come out with an average school building cost of under \u00a314m compared to \u00a321m under the BSF programme. It is not quite buy one, get one free. It is a three for two proposition.\" Builders have compared the programme to the coalition government \"shopping at Tesco\" while Labour was \"shopping at Selfridges\".</p> <p>The coalition's school building programme is an almost complete reversal of Labour's ambitious 2003 policy of rebuilding or renewing all 3,500 English secondary schools over 15 years. It came amid soaring public spending on education, which rose from \u00a335bn a year in 2000 to \u00a364bn by 2009, and attracted some of the world's best architects.</p> <p>Lord Foster, best known for designing headquarters for multinational corporations, designed one of the most expensive schools ever built in Britain, the Thomas Deacon academy in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, which reportedly cost close to \u00a350m. The cloud-shaped, office-style building has curved, glass-fronted classrooms and an undulating glass and steel structure roof over a vast atrium.</p> <p>In the first four years of the BSF programme, only 42 of the 200 schools that were intended to be built were completed and the budget was underestimated by about \u00a31bn a year, according to a report by the National Audit Office.</p> <p>Lauener said architects were guilty of including too many \"fripperies\" in the last generation of schools. Gove has previously singled out architects' fees as a waste of public money. Last year, he told a conference on free schools: \"We won't be getting any award-winning architects to design it, because no one in this room is here to make architects richer.\"</p> <p>His officials have told builders to cut 15% from school space before issuing tenders next month for contracts to rebuild packages of about 10 schools at a time to standardised designs. The minimum size of a classroom is expected to be maintained at about 54 square metres (580sq ft), which means that the squeeze will bite disproportionately on other areas, builders said. \"One of the problems with the new model is that it may be a little tight on area,\" admitted one contractor who has been working with the government on the designs.</p> <p>Galliford Try has produced a design billed as \"the optimum primary school\", with 80% of every school designed identically from the same kit of parts. It states: \"One clear target was to reduce or remove non-net areas such as circulation.\"</p> <p>The National Union of Teachers warned that narrower corridors could lead to discipline issues in busy schools and cuts to the size of assembly halls could damage the cohesion of school life.</p> <p>\"The spaces outside the classroom are vital to the culture and climate of a school and to have well-ordered corridors is key,\" said Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary. \"In a secondary school, there are potentially 1,000 pupils changing lessons at exactly the same time and, if corridors are narrow, it will lead to them bumping into one another and that could lead to discipline problems.\"</p> <p>Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the cuts to space \"will reduce the standards of learning in our schools and damage the working environment. Once again, the government's ideology is taking precedence over common sense and decent educational provision for children and young people\".</p> <p>The Royal Institute of British Architects warned the policy could undermine the government's own attempts to maximise the use of new school buildings by making them available after hours for community events in canteens and assembly halls.</p> <p>In preparation for the coalition's replacement Priority School Building Programme, the construction company Wates has already trademarked four templates for new or converted schools, which, it argues, could be introduced anywhere.</p> <p>\"We came up with four blueprints costing around \u00a31,450 per square metre compared to the \u00a32,200 to \u00a32,900 under the Building Schools for the Future programme,\" said Stephen Beechey, Wates's head of education. \"They are based on a kit of parts like in the car industry. The schools will share 80% of the same components and then we will design [the rest] for specific schools. We will not be producing iconic designs and they will not be shortlisted for the <a href=\"http://ribastirlingprize.architecture.com/\" title=\"Stirling prize\">Stirling prize</a>. However, they are good quality buildings that are individual and meet the needs of 21st-century curriculums.\"</p> <p>The latest policy on school buildings in effect dismisses the argument, employed to justify paying millions of pounds of fees to award-winning architects, that good design can boost pupils' attainment. \"A school building should be a safe and welcoming environment in which great teaching can take place, but it is teachers who will inspire children, not buildings,\" said Lauener.</p> <p>\"I know it is not buildings that make a successful school,\" said Liam Nolan, head of Perry Beeches academy in Birmingham, one of the most improved schools in the country.</p> <p>\"In April 2007, when I first walked through the doors of Perry Beeches, the \u00a320m school building was barely seven years old, designed with state of the art techniques and maintained at huge cost. But I was entering one of the worst performing schools in the UK.\"</p> <p>But Philip Avery, assistant headteacher at Bohunt school in Liphook, Hampshire, said he did not believe the design of a school could be divorced from the teaching that goes on in it. \"I worry this [the new policy] is too much a kit approach. It feels like we are swinging from the flashy designs with sails hanging from the atrium ceilings to an Ikea or Tesco approach.\"</p> <p>Peter Clegg, an architect whose firm, Feilden Clegg Bradley, is completing five of the last BSF schools, said: \"Standardisation of buildings is really difficult when you are extending or undertaking part-conversion. I am not at all sure these designs are going to be universally applicable. You have to go and be the traditional school architect: carry out an analysis of the existing buildings, what works and what doesn't, and decide where to spend a limited amount of money.\"</p>",
  "<p>When you have been secretary general of the United Nations for 10 years, it's never going to be easy to slip into humdrum anonymity. Kofi Annan gave it a good go. On leaving office he and his wife borrowed a friend's Italian hideaway, deep in the forests near Lake Como, and retreated into eight weeks of blissful solitude. With no TV, no radio, no papers; Annan was free, finally, from the clamour of the world's troubles. Two weeks in, he began to get bored.</p> <p>\"Let's go to the tobacconist in the village,\" he suggested, \"and buy a paper.\"</p> <p>They had been in the shop for less than five minutes before his heart sank. A group of men were gathered in the corner, staring. \"Oh no!\" he whispered to his wife. \"We've got six weeks to go, and we've blown our cover. How are we going to manage?\" One of the men approached and thrust out a pen and paper. \"Morgan Freeman, may I have an autograph?\" Annan flashed his best Hollywood smile, scribbled \"Morgan Freeman\" and fled.</p> <p>\"So when people say: 'Here's a man who needs no introduction,'\" he chuckles. \"I say to them, careful!\"</p> <p>As he's telling the story it occurs to me that a tourist's failure to recognise his successor would not constitute an amusing anecdote. Annan does have a curiously movie-star presence, flawlessly crisp and unusually still, but five years after leaving office he remains a more commanding presence in world affairs than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ban-ki-moon\" title=\"\">Ban Ki Moon</a>. \"I thought retirement was going to be easier,\" he smiles, \"but I discover it's hard work. I should do what Mandela says and retire from retirement one day.\"</p> <p>We meet just a few weeks after he stood down as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/02/kofi-annan-resigns-syria-envoy\" title=\"\">UN's special envoy to Syria</a>, and his dismay at the ongoing carnage clearly hasn't faded. It's equally clear, however, that he saw no choice but to quit. \"The first thing I said to the security council was: 'This is a near-impossible task. I'm going to try, but I can only do it if I have your united and sustained support.' Because you need that support in order to put pressure on all the parties. 'United' is key. Be united.\" But the security council remained divided, and as a consequence, Annan says gravely: \"The Syrians are going to pay the price. It's an innocent people caught in the middle.\"</p> <p>The plight of Syria is, in a sense, an extension of Annan's new book, or an illustration of its fundamental message. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Interventions-A-Life-War-Peace/dp/1846142970\" title=\"\">Interventions: A Life In War and Peace</a> tells the story of his 50-year UN career, and of the emerging role of UN peacekeeping. It's a role with which Annan has been intimately linked, but humanitarian intervention \u2013 like Syria's future today \u2013 lies ultimately at the whim of the security council.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-394046026\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/8/2/120802AnnanStatement-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/8/2/120802AnnanStatement-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/8/2/120802AnnanStatement_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120802AnnanStatement/120802AnnanStatement.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/8/2/120802AnnanStatement_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>Until the early 90s, UN peacekeeping efforts had been minimal, most conflicts being adjudicated by the world's two superpowers, whose hostility ensured a security council too divided to authorise more than a handful of peacekeeping missions. Between 1987 and 1992 barely a single UN mission consisted of more than 100 observers, facing little personal risk. By 1994, however, 80,000 UN troops were deployed in highly dangerous warzones. Annan took charge of peacekeeping in 1993, and his book provides a fascinating account of the new challenges facing a security council that, no longer paralysed by division, finds itself the repository of global demands for something to be done about pretty much every problem in the world.</p> <p>\"Time and again, when member states and the governments are faced with an insoluble problem, and they're under pressure to do something, that something usually ends up being referred to the UN.\" He allows a wry chuckle. \"The security council is dealing it with it, so they can relax. And you get the mandates, yes. You just don't get the commensurate resources to deal with it, so you are bound to run into difficulties and fail. And then be blamed. One of my predecessors used to say the letters SG [secretary general] stood for scapegoat.\"</p> <p>The new appetite for humanitarian intervention was in its honeymoon period in 1993, when UN forces were committed in Somalia to what then US secretary of state Madeleine Albright declared \"an unprecedented enterprise aimed at nothing less than the restoration of an entire country\". But after rebels downed two US helicopters, the Americans pulled out, and the UN mission collapsed. The legacy of this failure, Annan writes, explains why the UN stood by and watched a massacre unfold in Rwanda a year later. When the world belatedly woke up to the genocide, UN peacekeepers were blamed for member states' reluctance to risk their own troops' lives.</p> <p>When it came to Kosovo in 1999, Russian support for Serbia ruled out any chance of a security council resolution mandating troops. For the first time in the history of the UN, its secretary general endorsed military action conducted by Nato without the authorisation of the security council. It was, by Annan's account, the ultimate moral dilemma; do loyalties lie with the UN and the rule of law, or with innocent civilians being slaughtered? He stands by his support for the Nato airstrikes, but warned at the time that unless the security council was restored as the sole source of legitimacy, the world would be \"on a dangerous path to anarchy\". That prediction proved horribly prescient four years later, when the security council failed to pass a second resolution authorising an invasion of Iraq, and the war went ahead anyway. The war came close to costing him his job \u2013 but to many of his admirers it became his finest moment.</p> <p>Annan was always doubtful about the extent of Saddam's hidden WMDs. \"The UN inspectors had been in there for quite a long time, and destroyed quite a few arms; in fact, people argued that they destroyed more weapons than the first gulf war. So the feeling was that he may have had something, but how massive, and the nature of the weapons, was unsure.\" So why wouldn't Saddam co-operate with the inspections? \"He had been bluffing to his neighbours for so many years, telling them: 'I'm powerful, I've got these weapons, don't mess with me.' It was a psychological bluff. So he couldn't bear to admit that actually he'd lied. I think that was the explanation.\"</p> <p>Annan's great regret was to appoint a gung-ho weapons inspector, insensitive to the delicacy of Iraqi military pride. Richard Butler, he writes, was \"a colossal mistake and one of the worst appointments I ever made\". Why? \"In a place like Baghdad, where the people are very nationalistic, you need to find a way to work with them. You cannot go there and throw your weight around.\"</p> <p>He still winces at the memory of all the grandstanding that led inexorably to war. Bizarrely, in the midst of all George Bush's fighting talk, the president told Annan: \"It brings tears to my eyes to think of what the Iraqi people are going through under Saddam.\" Annan is generous enough to say: \"I think it was genuine; I don't think it would be crocodile tears,\" but pretty blunt about Bush's other motives. \"There was quite a bit of that in the air, that he was trying to finish his dad's job. And the advisers around him also wanted that. They were also thinking, we kill two birds with one stone \u2013 we get rid of a bad dictator, and get rid of the weapons.\" What about the third bird \u2013 Iraq's oil reserves? \"Well that's what people say,\" Annan agrees with a chuckle. Those who say it have often been dismissed as lefty conspiracy theorists \u2013 but when I ask if Annan would say it himself, he replies without hesitation: \"Yes. It was a country with resources in a region of extreme importance to the world. I'm not sure if Iraq had been as poor as Somalia that there would have been that interest in going to save the country.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398420588\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348846778904/Kofi-Annan-in-Naqura-Leba-010.jpg\" alt=\"Kofi Annan in Naqura, Lebanon\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kofi Annan in Naqura, Lebanon in 2006, flanked by UN peacekeeping troops Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is less sure about Tony Blair's motivation. \"Tony, at his best, in his heyday, would have been one of the most brilliant politicians of his time. But how he got himself entangled with this \u2026 I think there was a genuine friendship with Bush, but perhaps there was greater need on Tony's side than on Bush's. I wasn't sure if Tony genuinely wanted to go to war, or was just trying to protect the special relationship, and the special relationship trumped everything. It's difficult to say, because at the beginning he appeared to be on the right side, and he was also in favour of a second resolution. I hoped that would have been the point where you tell George: 'George, you are on your own. I'm not following you on this without the council resolution.' And I wonder what George would have said.\" Does he think it might have stopped him? \"I think it could have made a big difference.\"</p> <p>In 2007, Blair was appointed special envoy to the Quartet, a diplomatic mission created in 2002 by Annan himself to represent the US, EU, UK and Russia in peace talks on Palestine. I found Blair's appointment baffling, and tell Annan I struggle to see how he could \u2026 \"Do it?\" Annan completes the sentence. \"Yeah, yeah.\" So he shares the bewilderment? \"I share some of that. I was surprised that he accepted the role. And nothing much is happening on that dossier. For the past four to five years there has been no real Middle East mediation.\"</p> <p>Annan famously declared the Iraq war illegal, and has never regretted it. \"Because that was my genuine belief.\" But the price he paid took even him by surprise; \"The UN got attacked, and I got attacked personally. The Oil For Food situation was used to beat me up and also beat up the UN.\" The US made allegations of widespread corruption under the Oil For Food programme, which Annan believes were motivated entirely by a desire to punish him, for they took a sinister turn when his own son, Kojo, became implicated. Kojo had worked for a Swiss company, which in 1998 won a contract under the programme; he left the company that same year, but then came the revelation that, unbeknown to his father, it had continued to pay him for a further five years. Annan was mortified. \"And furious.\"</p> <p>It must have tested the father-son relationship to breaking point. \"Yes,\" he agrees uneasily, \"A friend of mine said: 'It's tough for you, but I also feel for your son. You come under the microscope not because of something you've done or who you are, but because of your father \u2013 and that makes life difficult for a young person.' But I said: 'There are certain things you just don't do.'\" Why hadn't Kojo told his father about the ongoing payments? \"Maybe, sometimes, if you think you need help from Daddy, you probably don't share all the information. I don't know. We're talking about a boy who was 22, 23 at the time. But now we are OK.\"</p> <p>The pressure from Washington was ferocious, but he never seriously contemplated resignation. \"It may have fleetingly crossed my mind. Sometimes you feel: 'Who needs this? Why should one put up with this?' But I felt it was a witch-hunt. So to walk away and give them the feeling that they have won? No.\"</p> <p>For all its ugliness, the onslaught against Annan was in essence no more than a manifestation of the fundamental tension underscoring his whole diplomatic career \u2013 the conflict between national self-interest, or realpolitik, and the loftier ideal of international law embodied by the organisation Annan served for 50 years.</p> <p>\"They clash, they clash,\" he agrees, with a smile. \"I think we've made progress, but you are right \u2013 the national interest still often trumps the broader interest. But what governments and people don't realise is that sometimes the collective interest \u2013 the international interest \u2013 is also the national interest.\"</p> <p>Born in 1938 into a powerful Ghanaian tribe, Annan had a privileged childhood in what was the Gold Coast, coming of age as his country won independence from Britain. Awarded a scholarship to study in America, he assumed he'd return to serve his nation, but a job with the World Health Organisation in Geneva introduced him to a \"worldly and engaging environment\", which made him reassess his loyalties. \"I began,\" he writes, \"to realise that community for me would mean something different from what it had meant to my father's generation.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398420589\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348846298199/Kofi-Annanon-Sesame-Stree-010.jpg\" alt=\"Kofi Annanon Sesame Street\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kofi Annan makes an appearance on Sesame Street in 2001.

I've always wondered what Annan says to world leaders \u2013 often monstrous tyrants, even crypto-terrorists \u2013 to win their trust and persuade them to make peace. The book is full of references to marathon late-night phone calls to warring parties, and the art, he says, is quite simple. You have to understand what drives them, appeal to their pride and vanity, and offer them a way out that saves face.</p> <p>\"Dignity is very important. It's about dignity. Without beating up on them, I say: 'If you're really a leader, and are interested in the interests of your people, you have to lead; you have to show courage. If you are really a strong man as you say you are, you have to look out for the weak in your society. Look at what you're doing to them.' They have to feel that you have their interests at heart. These are people with egos, and a sense of legacy, so you ask: 'What legacy are you going to leave?' Saddam probably saw himself as a modern-day <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin\" title=\"\">Saladin</a> \u2013 the glorious Arab warrior. He saw himself as someone who was building his nation. So you tell him: 'You want all this destroyed? How do you think you will be judged?'</p> <p>\"That matters, because these people often have a certain image of themselves, and they will go to an incredible extent to protect themselves. So I tell them what their actions mean, how they are seen by the outside world.\"</p> <p>I suspect Annan must struggle to imagine how he will be judged himself, for his identity is so subsumed within that of the UN as to be almost indivisible. When I ask him to name the single greatest misconception about him, his first response is telling. \"About me, or about the UN?\" About him, I say. He falls into lengthy silent thought.</p> <p>\"That he's too soft,\" he offers eventually. \"Because they feel he doesn't pound the table \u2013 not assertive enough. But it doesn't bother me, because sometimes you don't have to fight to get your way. You don't have to pick a fight to get them to change their mind, or get them to see things your way. You really don't.\"</p> <p><em>Interventions by Kofi Annan is published by Allen Lane, rrp \u00a325.

  "<p>After an eventful year, China has cleared the decks for a wholesale change of leadership amid a particularly challenging set of circumstances. Turbo-powered growth has left the last major state ruled by a communist party facing a string of political, economic and social questions. The five-yearly party congress <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19755035\" title=\"\">on 8 November</a>, which will appoint the new leaders to steer the country through the rest of this decade, is, therefore, as important in its way as the US presidential poll two days earlier.</p> <p>Whatever the faults of the US system, the contrast between the competitive election across the Pacific, held after months of open policy discussion, and the closed-door transition of power in China is striking. For all the praise from foreign commentators about the way China works, that contrast points to a significant weakness in the system that tries to guide the world's second largest economy on a path of \"scientific&#xa0;socialism\".</p> <p>It has now been 63 years since Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic, and the market-led economic reforms launched at the end of the 1970s&#xa0;by his successor, Deng Xiaoping, have changed the country and the world&#xa0;beyond all measure. But the basic power equation has not budged, confronting those in charge with the task of containing a society that has been brought to prefer materialism to Marxism or Confucianism.</p> <p>In many ways this is healthy. The traditional ruling method, stretching back to the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/c/china_eastern_zhou_dynasty.aspx\" title=\"\">first emperor in 221 BC</a>, was patriarchal and despotic, and was picked up enthusiastically by the communists. But&#xa0;it sits on top of a country in which individuals enjoy a far greater degree of&#xa0;liberty, behaviour patterns are shifting fast, respect for authority is&#xa0;not what&#xa0;it was and technology \u2013 especially in the form of social media \u2013 has wrought a revolution.</p> <p>But the leadership, outgoing and incoming, acts as if nothing has changed. In the Leninist pecking order, the party ranks above the government and the real decisions are made in its politburo, which operates in the strictest secrecy. There is no open policy discussion. Control is everything. The institutions of civil society are absorbed into the official apparatus. Dissent is equated to subversion. Judges swear an oath of loyalty, not to China or to the legal system, but to the communist movement. The party's disciplinary commission can pick anybody up at will, without charge, and hold them for interrogation in a secret location.</p> <p>Occasionally, a corner of the curtain is lifted, as in the party's expulsion last week of the one-time rising star Bo Xilai, boss of the mega-municipality of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/15/china.china\" title=\"\">Chongqing</a> (32 million inhabitants) till last spring. He was accused of \"grave violations of party discipline\", \"massive bribery\", \"improper sexual relations with multiple women\" and \"errors and culpability\" in the cases of former Chongqing police chief <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/24/china-police-chief-wang-lijun-jailed?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Wang Lijun</a>, and Bo's wife, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/27/neil-heywood-unsafe-warns-scientist\" title=\"\">Gu Kailai</a>, who was convicted last month of the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood.</p> <p>Those charges may or may not be justified, but the fundamental reason for&#xa0;Bo's fall was the fear his ambition and ruthlessness aroused among his peers in the leadership, as he sought to join the supreme decision-making body, the politburo standing committee. For the last 10 years, under Hu Jintao, China&#xa0;has been run on consensus, a dictatorship without a dictator. That is certainly better than the days when Mao got out of bed in the afternoon and launched some adventurous scheme that brought death to millions. But it does not allow for the likes of Bo, who step out of the opaque central circle and plough their own furrow.</p> <p>The political defenestration of this champion of Mao-era values and of state control, who backed the use of the law against opponents, is no bad thing. But the way Bo's case was decided secretly by the politburo, after he disappeared, following his dismissal from his Chongqing post in the spring, is the antithesis of the rule of law. It was a power play in which the charges were personal, raising the question of how many others act similarly but evade censure by bowing to the rule of the centre.</p> <p>There was no debate about the policies Bo pursued \u2013 an awkward matter: Hu Jintao and his anointed successor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Xi Jinping</a>, went to the city to sing the praises of the \"Chongqing model\", but since then, photographs of&#xa0;their visits have disappeared from Chinese websites.</p> <p>Such issues go to the heart of the challenge the People's Republic faces. Its essentially conservative leadership is&#xa0;stuck in a system of opaque, top-down rule. Like the emperors before them, the&#xa0;leaders fear that change may&#xa0;bring down the whole edifice. But if&#xa0;the party has no alternative, its model&#xa0;is reaching its limits.</p> <p>Deng made the economy the driver of&#xa0;national revival and the party's's recovery from the implosion of the Cultural Revolution, but expansion is slowing down, shot through with inefficiency and excess capacity, and paying the price for the failure to address crucial issues such as land ownership, labour movement, capital markets and water and energy supply. Though the party claims to stand for the people, there are an estimated 150,000 popular protests a year. The lack of trust people feel covers everything from food safety standards to official pronouncements \u2013 \"Only believe something when the government denies it,\" a saying goes. Corruption and yawning disparities of wealth fuel resentment. The environment is a mess and the demographics are heading the wrong&#xa0;way.</p> <p>Still, for most of its people, this is the best time to live in China during the&#xa0;modern era. The material and social strides made in the past few decades are indisputable. But they have brought the need for a new approach from the top, and time is running out. If the new leadership cannot forge that, China's future will be far more uncertain than its&#xa0;recent past.</p>",

  "<p>Crispin Aubrey, the journalist, author and campaigner, who has died of a heart attack aged 66, came to national prominence when he was arrested under the Official Secrets Act in 1977. His subsequent trial and the campaign around it led to a re-examination of secrecy legislation and shone a light into some of the darker corners of the intelligence services.</p> <p>Born to Margery Aubrey, an illustrator, and her husband, Lawrie, an insurance broker, in Chipstead, Surrey, Crispin went to Leighton Park, a Quaker school in Reading, Berkshire. From there he won a scholarship to read English literature at Christ Church, Oxford.</p> <p>His journalistic career began as a general reporter on the Hampshire Chronicle. He joined Time Out magazine, then in its early, radical days, in 1974. He was one of the first investigative reporters to focus on the environment and nuclear energy.</p> <p>In the late 70s, Time Out became involved in exposing British and American government secrecy and dirty tricks, with the help of the dissident ex-CIA agent, Philip Agee. Agee and another Time Out reporter, the American Mark Hosenball, who had just co-authored an expos\u00e9 of GCHQ, the government's communications headquarters in Cheltenham, were served with deportation orders by the then home secretary, Merlyn Rees, \"in the interests of national security\". An ultimately unsuccessful campaign to halt their expulsions was launched, with Aubrey at its forefront.</p> <p>A former member of Signals Intelligence, John Berry, also outraged by the deportation orders, contacted Time Out, and Aubrey and the freelance journalist Duncan Campbell (my namesake), an expert in the field, went to interview him in north London. The Time Out phones had been tapped: the three were arrested by special branch as they left Berry's flat, and were held in Brixton prison.</p> <p>The ABC defence campaign, named after their initials, was launched with the backing of the National Union of Journalists. Elements of the case against them became farcical, with some prosecution witnesses at court hearings identified only by an initial. One of them, \"Colonel B\", was cheerfully outed by campaigners singing, \"Who do you think you are kidding, Colonel Johnstone, when you say you're Colonel B?\" in front of Tottenham magistrates court. Aubrey enjoyed the mischievous side of what turned out to be a long campaign.</p> <p>The trial of the three took place at the Old Bailey in 1978, with Aubrey charged with unauthorised receipt of classified information.</p> <p>The prosecution, chastened by a hostile media and public reaction and the defence's disclosure that much of the supposedly secret information was already in the public domain, dropped in mid-trial the more serious charge under section one of the Official Secrets Act. The three were convicted on a lesser charge, but given non-custodial sentences and the act was severely discredited. The experience led Aubrey to write Who's Watching You? Britain's Security Service and the Officials Secrets Act, published in 1981.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396931052\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/30/1349022650055/Crispin-Aubrey-left-at-Gl-010.jpg\" alt=\"Crispin Aubrey, left, at Glastonbury festival.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crispin Aubrey, left, was a committed anti-nuclear campaigner.

  "<p>A leading tax expert has accused Glencore of cutting its UK tax bill by tens of millions of pounds after profits at the commodity trader's London arm were depressed by complex insurance contracts taken out with its own parent.</p> <p>The latest Glencore tax controversy, which comes as the group prepares for another landmark day in its long-running battle to acquire the miner Xstrata, follows the company's Zambian subsidiary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/17/glencore-denies-copper-tax-allegations\" title=\"\">Mopani becoming embroiled in a tax avoidance row last year</a>, as well as Glencore being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/24/tax-parliament-transparency-developing-countries\" title=\"\">called in front of parliament's international development committee in April</a> as part of an inquiry into how multinationals report tax in developing countries.</p> <p>The derivative instruments being employed by Glencore are widely used by companies to insure \u2013 or hedge \u2013 financial risks. They theoretically guarantee a certain return.</p> <p>Last year, Glencore UK's derivative trading with other parts of the group totalled $383bn (\u00a3267bn), more than twice the yearly budget of the National Health Service. The practice resulted in a $122.8m loss for the London-based business, effectively docking that amount from UK profits and transferring it to the main group based in the <a href=\"http://www.lcg-swiss-consult.ch/Taxation-in-the-Canton-of-Zug.597+M52087573ab0.0.html\" title=\"\">low-tax Swiss canton of Zug</a>.</p> <p>Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK, said: \"Glencore is insuring itself with itself. If I insure my house for fire with myself and it burns down, I've got to pay myself for the house which has burnt down. That's what Glencore is doing, and the consequences are that the risk is never leaving Glencore; it's still inside the group. That's $383bn worth of trades that, on the face of it, make no sense whatsoever. We don't know, but it is highly likely that the motivation is not genuine insurance and it looks like a significant amount of tax planning takes place within this trading function.\"</p> <p>Murphy said Glencore was not breaking any laws by employing the trades or by benefiting from the resultant losses \u2013 and many large companies were increasingly exploring similar tactics.</p> <p>He said: \"This is totally legal but what we are seeing is a significant change in the way in which multinational corporations are now looking to move their profits around the world.</p> <p>\"All the evidence is that throughout the extractive industries \u2013 the mining industry, the oil industry, the gas industry and so on \u2013 the way in which people are shifting profits now are derivative financial products.\"</p> <p>Glencore UK's accounts show that its massive turnover of $59.8bn in 2011 resulted in a pre-tax profit of $99.1m, a margin of less than 1%. A tax credit, the result of unrelated employee share awards, took total profits for the year to $115.7m. Had the $122.8m derivatives loss remained in the UK and been added to those profits, it would have attracted taxes of about $32m.</p> <p>Glencore insisted that lowering its tax bill was not the purpose of the derivative trades. Glencore's Baar-based spokesman said: \"The derivative contracts Glencore Energy uses in London with its parent company in Switzerland are effectively tools to help it manage risk.</p> <p>\"They enable risk to be concentrated at the centre, where it can be absorbed due to the size of its capital base. These are standard contracts used by many companies across many industries. This is about managing risk and nothing to do with avoiding tax. Like all major global corporations, we work closely with local tax authorities to ensure that we pay the correct and appropriate amount of tax.\"</p> <p>In 2010, Glencore UK made a profit $186.5m on insuring itself with its parent, although those winnings were virtually all cancelled out by losses on external derivative contracts.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Glencore's efforts to take over miner Xstrata are expected to receive a boost when the target's board unveils support for Glencore's revised offer. Xstrata's statement is also expected to include revisions to the way shareholders vote on controversial executive retention packages.</p>",
  "<p>Global warming is likely to shrink the size of fish by as much as a quarter in coming decades, according to a groundbreaking new study of the world's oceans.</p> <p>The reduction in individual fish size will be matched by a dwindling of overall fish stocks, warned scientists, at a time when the world's growing human population is putting ever greater pressure on fisheries.</p> <p>\"We were surprised as we did not think the effects would be so strong and so widespread,\" said Prof William Cheung from the University of British Columbia in Canada, who led the research. His team examined the effect of rising ocean temperatures on the growth and distribution of more than 600 species of fish around the world and found that they are expected to shrink in size by 14-24% by 2050, with the biggest effects in tropical regions.</p> <p>\"It could be worse than that,\" said Prof Callum Roberts, at the University of York, who described the research as the most comprehensive to date. Roberts, who was not one of the study's authors, said additional impacts of climate change such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/10/ocean-acidification-epoca\" title=\"\">acidification of the ocean</a> and reduction of nutrients in surface waters could <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/24/food-climate-change-fisheries\" title=\"\">decrease fish stocks</a> even further, as would continued overfishing.</p> <p>\"We will see dramatic changes in the oceans likely to reduce productivity,\" said Roberts. \"One billion people rely on fish for primary animal protein and that is going to increase, especially in developing countries. We have to get to grips with our dependence on fossil fuels otherwise we are stuffed.\"</p> <p>The fish shrinkage predicted by the new research results from two effects: the difficulty of growing in warmer, oxygen-poor waters, and migration.</p> <p>\"The metabolic rate of fish in the warm oceans increases and therefore they need more oxygen,\" said Cheung, whose work is <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nclimate1691\" title=\"\">published in Nature Climate Change</a>. But warm water holds less oxygen and so their growth is limited.</p> <p>In addition, there are more small-bodied fish in the tropics and these will migrate to temperate or polar regions as the ocean warms, reducing the average fish size.</p> <p>The two effects are similar in impact, said Cheung, who used computer models to project the effect of warming on fish physiology, distribution, migration and population.</p> <p>\"We are already seeing the effects,\" he added, pointing to a 2011 study that showed the <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2011.02940.x/abstract\" title=\"\">reduction in the size of haddock</a> in the North Sea correlated closely with increasing temperature. Cheung's team projected temperature rises using data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, based on a high-emissions scenario that <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2011/06/iea-and-ipcc-temperature-projections\" title=\"\">matches the current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions</a>.</p> <p>\"Our work shows a very concerning future for the oceans and so it is very important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and develop better fish management policies to adapt to these changes,\" said Cheung.</p> <p>Roberts said the research showed the impact of climate change on the oceans looked set to be greater than previously predicted. The reduction in fish size due to overfishing was well known, he said, as for the last century fish have increasingly \"lived fast and died young\", preventing them reaching full size. But, if overfishing continues, this effect would be additional to the shrinkage caused by warming, Roberts said.</p> <p>Furthermore, rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere leads to more of the gas dissolving in the ocean, increasing its acidity. \"That makes life much tougher for animals that make a chalky skeleton,\" said Roberts. \"We need to worry about these tiny animals \u2013 such as coccoliths and foraminifera \u2013 which are an important part of primary production: the base of the food chain.\"</p> <p>Lastly, Roberts said the heating of the oceans means that the warmer layer at the surface mixes less with the colder layer below. As the colder layer contains most of the nutrients, that means less food for fish. \"We are already seeing some evidence of this, as oceanic 'deserts' are getting larger.\"</p> <p>\"All this is yet one more reason to do something to cut greenhouse gases urgently,\" he said.</p>",

And this is just scratching the surface.</p> <p>But what about the impact on school leaders, teachers and staff?</p> <p>For Robert Ford, deputy head teacher, with responsibility for the curriculum, at Crickhowell High School, Powys, working with school leaders in other countries helps his school take its learning beyond its rural surroundings in Wales.</p> <p>He said: \"We are a very rural school in the Brecon Beacons in Wales and interacting with the wider world and accessing ideas and other people and schools is crucial for our wider understanding and meaningful educational experience.</p> <p>\"And this seems to be key for most schools; international collaboration helps staff to go beyond their own school grounds to seek ideas for improving their school, teaching practice and lessons.\"</p> <p>Robert has been involved with global learning for many years, on a range of projects, funding, programmes and worked with schools and educational boards around the world. As such, Crickhowell has designed programmes to ensure teachers, school leaders and support staff get contact with international partners - as well as students.</p> <p>\"For me it has been an incredible side to my development as a teacher and a school leader,\" he said. \"The experience of seeing classrooms and schools around the world in places as diverse as Siberia, Indonesia, Thailand, the USA and Canada makes me see education in a much more holistic way. It also allows me to use comparative knowledge of different educational systems in the way I carry out the decisions and plan for the future in a 21st century global world where education has never mattered more.\"</p> <p>Cookridge Primary in Yorkshire is another school embedding international collaboration into professional development for staff and lessons for students.</p> <p>It has an impressive portfolio of links and projects that include a wide-ranging funded partnership with Colegio Esperanza - a school in Mexico, funded collaboration with schools across in Finland, Slovakia, Ireland and another school in Birmingham for the national perspective as part of the British Council's Comenius multilateral scheme.</p> <p>Jo Speak, assistant head teacher, Cookridge Primary School said: \"We have teachers going to Europe for professional development. We have three members of staff in Finland, as we speak. So, we're looking forward to them sharing their ideas and development following the meetings there.\"</p> <p>Sending staff away on exchanges is all part of the grand plan for Cookridge Primary; to absorb and implement new ideas and practices picked up from international partners - and beyond.</p> <p>From approaches to teaching and pedagogy to the ways of working with outside agencies, Cookridge and its partner school in Mexico swap all their best brainwaves and practices. \"It's all about opening our eyes and questioning things that we take for granted or the way we've always done things. By working with leaders in other countries, we can enter into dialogue of why we do things. It's an added bonus to international collaboration,\" says Jo.</p> <p>She added: \"I've been really inspired by the dedication of teachers no matter where they are and the enthusiasm to work as a member of a team, whether there's the atlantic ocean between them; it's that building up of relationships, being creative and thinking up ideas that will help our learners no matter what country they're living in.\"</p> <p>Although lots of the lessons and projects inspired by these partnerships celebrate differences between cultures, it's exploring the shared agendas that reap most benefits for school leaders. Through the British Council's Comenius programme the school has been able to network with other schools in Europe to explore areas such as special educational needs, more able children or working with children from the travelling and Roma communities.</p> <p>Jo said: \"Whatever the focus is, it's an opportunity to work together to discuss different approaches and pedagogy, and it's that ability to carry on working with fellow colleagues and having dialogues to explore what works well and what doesn't.</p> <p>\"That's a great opportunity for our teachers and leaders in the UK to get out and work with colleagues across Europe.\"</p> <p>It's breaking out of that silo-style of working that appeals to many school leaders. Particularly head teachers.</p> <p>\"The role of a head in a school is quite challenging and sometimes quite an isolated role,\" says Derek Smith, head of Olashore International School in Nigeria. \"So there's quite a lot of support that can be found through links with heads from other schools; through conferences and social networking and so on.</p> <p>\"When you're a teacher, one of the things you don't often see is in another teacher's classroom and it's the same when you're a head. What you don't often see is other schools and what's being done successfully.\"</p> <p>Derek spends lots of time visiting local schools in his area, and, when he's in the UK, visiting schools here too. He also uses digital tools to connect with heads; LinkedIn for leaders in other countries and Blackberry Messenger (BBM) to talk to peers in Nigeria.</p> <p>Tools are important. For example, Derek is currently working with a group of school leaders via an initiative at the American University of Nigeria to set up a new teacher training group. They share ideas and contact through BBM, as it's the easiest way to communicate in Nigeria.</p> <p>He said: \"If you want to do something like that, you have to use a tool that the heads are happy to use. Most people don't have time to learn something else in addition to running their school. I think different countries have different key areas and if you want to connect to international heads you need to use something that doesn't make their life more difficult.\" </p> <p>As well as informing his approach to management and innovation in his school, international work and collaboration has played an interesting and crucial part in Derek's personal career development too. In 1995, back when he was a maths teacher in the UK, he volunteered with VSO, which set him on the path to becoming head of an international school.</p> <p>He said: \"I worked in a local school in Guinea-Bissau but it gave me a lot of opportunities to be involved in a lot of things. I set up teacher training workshops and through that I ended up having contacts with heads and other schools and that extended up to work with the Ministry of Education and European Union in country. That gave me a lot of the experience of dealing with people at different levels.\"</p> <p>Damian James, curriculum manager of health and life services at South West College, Northern Ireland, is another teacher turned leader whose career has developed thanks to experience with international collaboration. It all started around 15 years ago when he was a lecturer of travel and tourism at the college.</p> <p>He said: \"My colleagues applied for British Council funding for Comenius projects and I accompanied them on exchange visits, and so on. From there my role increased and changed as I became involved more in instigating projects and developing opportunities.\"</p> <p>Over time the college has evolved and he has moved into a management role.</p> <p>\"On a personal level, I have no doubt it has helped me move in to my management role within the college. I believe it has shown my ability to develop work from scratch, from an initial contact right through to either securing funding or coming up with ideas to collaborate on the different levels highlighted already.</p> <p>Working on international projects is a central aspect to Damian's role but he has seen the impact on the wider team too.</p> <p>\"International collaboration also offers a series of staff development opportunities from developing project management skills, to increasing enthusiasm and self-confidence for teaching,\" he said. \"It offers development opportunities outside of the routine - enhancing all-round abilities.</p> <p>\"It also promotes increased tolerance and respect for others, develops skills, motivation, capabilities and self-confidence which results in greater pride in college work. It also promotes teamwork and can provide an energy to college life, and add all round value. Crucially too, it helps the college be seen to be innovative and as offering exceptional educational opportunities, in turn helping to develop and enhance our reputation with local businesses and other stakeholders.\"</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>The economy is in a double-dip recession and the government is fighting a losing battle with the budget deficit. Voters' perception of ministers as a bunch of out-of-touch toffs has been reinforced by Andrew Mitchell's ill-tempered brush with the law. Labour is a comfortable 10 points ahead in the opinion polls and Ed Miliband can look forward to a warm reception when he addresses the party conference on Tuesday. Could life get any better for the opposition?</p> <p>Of course it could. As Neil Kinnock would testify, winning general elections is different from holding mid-term opinion poll leads. Labour will only win if it convinces voters on the economy and, despite the progress made since Ed Balls became shadow chancellor, it still has a lot of work to do.</p> <p>Balls faced three big challenges when he took the job: ridding Labour of the reputation for having landed Britain in an awful mess; making the case that George Osborne's deficit-cutting strategy was a dud; and laying out a programme that would prove Labour could do a better job if it was returned to power.</p> <p>Let's start with the good news. Right from the start, Balls insisted back in 2010 that Osborne was a \"growth denier\", who would drive the economy back into recession with his heavy-handed and ill-timed stringency. The shadow chancellor made this point during the battle for the Labour leadership in the one speech of note during the entire campaign. He has been proved right. The economy has gone backwards and the deficit is getting bigger rather than smaller. Osborne derided Alistair Darling's deficit-reduction plan as a timid little affair but it now looks as if the UK's debt position will be worse in 2015 than it would have been had Gordon Brown remained in Downing Street.</p> <p>The chancellor has some plausible-sounding excuses for why this has happened. He says he inherited a structurally flawed economy (true); that it always takes longer to return to recovery after a severe banking crisis (also true); and that Europe's debt crisis has been the main factor impeding the return to robust growth (much less true). The blunt fact is, however, that in May 2010 he told voters that his plan would work and it hasn't.</p> <p>Game, set and match to Balls, then? Not quite. Osborne certainly looks like a Wimbledon player a couple of breaks of serve down in the final set, but he has not given up hope that the economy will turn the corner over the next year. Third-quarter growth will be worse than it looks on the surface, but falling inflation should ease the squeeze on consumer spending power and there are signs that the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme is leading to a slight rise in the flow of credit to households.</p> <p>There is nothing to suggest that the economy is about to surge forward, but it is possible that a slow recovery in 2013 will provide cash-rich businesses with the incentive to invest over 2014. Osborne would then have the basis for an economic argument at the 2015 election: we inherited a mess and it has been a slog, but we are finally getting there.</p> <p>Balls would counter by saying that Britain could have got there a whole lot quicker had it not been for coalition blunders. Even so, if the backdrop to the 2015 election is an economy growing at 2.5-3% a year, Balls' task becomes a lot more difficult.</p> <p>Firstly, he must deal with the legacy issues from Labour's period in office from 1997-2010. The main criticism of the Blair-Brown governments is that they left office with the budget deficit at a peacetime record of 11% of GDP. This, though, was caused by the collapse of the economy and the failure of UK banks in the worst recession since the interwar years. Had Brown and Darling sought to balance the budget when demand was imploding, the recession would have been far worse.</p> <p>Instead, the really telling criticisms of Labour are that it allowed the City of London to become the Wild West of global finance, that it neglected Britain's crumbling manufacturing base because it was too busy cuddling up to hedge fund dealers, and that it allowed the public finances to deteriorate in the years leading up to before the crash by wrongly believing that the tax receipts from the bubbles in the housing and stock markets were permanent rather than temporary.</p> <p>Memories fade, but has the electorate forgiven and forgotten all that happened under Labour? Probably not, which is why Balls feels he must promise a root-and-branch examination of public spending if Labour wins the election. This makes political sense, because a big plank of the Conservative strategy in 2015 will be to make Labour explain which taxes will rise to pay for spending pledges. That proved an effective campaign weapon in 1992, when it allowed the Conservatives to avoid defeat despite presiding over five years of boom and bust.</p> <p>The second challenge for Balls and Miliband is to show that Labour would make a decent fist of running the economy after 2015. This is not the same as having a five-point plan to kick-start growth; nor will it be achieved by promising to chuck money at every problem.</p> <p>In simplified form, the state of Britain is as follows: the economy is 4% smaller than it was five years ago and the latest quarterly current account deficit was in excess of \u00a320bn. Five million people are on housing waiting lists yet housebuilding is at its lowest since the 1920s. The Libor scandal has illustrated once again that the City is a cesspit. New sources of tax revenue need to be found to meet the demands of a modern welfare state. North Sea oil and gas reserves are running out fast and the Conservative part of the coalition is backtracking on the environment. Labour needs policies for all these areas.</p> <p>Neal Lawson, chairman of the thinktank Compass, noted last week: \"The party has nothing to say on public-sector reform, nothing on welfare reform and nothing on climate change. If they have, then I and everyone else has missed it. Why not a real Green New Deal, a financial transaction tax? Why aren't we pushing harder on a living wage, a German-style <a href=\"http://nachhaltigkeit.kfw.de/EN_Home/Sustainability/Environmental_and_social_impact_assessments/index.jsp\" title=\"KfW\">KfW environmental bank</a>, real separation of the big retail and investment banks, new rules on takeovers, workers on boards, a national carers scheme, taxes on land and wealth, and so much more?\"</p> <p>Miliband went some of the way to meeting these concerns with his pledge to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/29/ed-miliband-british-banks?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">split up banks unless they change the way they operate</a> and put customers first. But the party conference is the start of a crucial few months for Labour. Until now it has been able to think and act like an opposition. To win, it now has to start thinking and acting like a government in waiting.</p>",
  "<p>It took just over four months for the tide of public opinion to turn against Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: at the start of September a poll revealed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/02/french-pessimistic-francois-hollande\" title=\"\">68% of French people were pessimistic about their country's future under their new president</a>. And that was the common line before <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19763665\" title=\"\">Friday's announcement of the 2013 budget</a>, which will find him even fewer friends in the country.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Moscovici\" title=\"\">Pierre Moscovici</a>, the finance minister, has boasted that no previous government has attempted to reduce the budget deficit by 1.5% in a single year \u2013 from 4.5% to 3% \u2013 and all that with almost nonexistent growth. But it is precisely this kind of ministerial pride that French people are worried about \u2013 whether they belong to the group who will be heavily taxed or are one of those 3 million unemployed who can't see how the austerity budget will help them find a job.</p> <p>Admittedly, a drop in popularity will have always been part of Hollande's calculations. With no elections for another two years, his government will feel it is wiser to take tough measures now rather than later, hoping that positive results will show when voters go back to the polls. Two years: that's the period president Hollande has said would be needed to turn the clock back on unemployment.</p> <p>Still, the proposed budget is far more of a shock than anyone could have predicted only a few weeks ago. It promises to achieve the eurozone-wide 3% budget deficit ceiling as early as 2013, a target Hollande has maintained despite the deterioration of the economy, with a mild recession under way.</p> <p>To do so will require a major effort, whose chance of success has divided opinions. The government needs to find an additional \u20ac30bn next year, and has chosen to divide this amount in three: one-third in spending cuts, and two-thirds in new taxes \u2013 half for businesses and half for individual taxpayers.</p> <p>Liberal economists criticise this division: they argue that state spending should have been cut much further, with fewer new taxes in a country that is already one of the bigger taxers in Europe. They fear job creation will suffer as both businesses and consumers are forced to tighten their belts. Technology entrepreneurs have been particularly vocal since Friday, complaining about a 60% tax on profits when selling a company \u2013 a sharp increase which, they say, will discourage the innovation sector.</p> <p>On the other side, leftwing critics of the socialists such as the former presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-luc-melenchon\" title=\"\">Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon</a> denounce an austerity package designed to satisfy financial markets and Europe's liberal vision, which is not what Hollande promised the French in his campaign against Nicolas Sarkozy.</p> <p>The \"left of the left\" is showing its muscle today, with a major demonstration planned in Paris against Hollande's choice to ratify the new European budgetary treaty in parliament, and not by referendum. The austerity measures in the new budget will have given leftwing voters an additional reason to join the march.</p> <p>Government spokesmen defend their approach as both orthodox and fair. Moscovici made a passionate plea for the reduction of the budget deficit \u2013 and therefore the French debt burden \u2013 in an <a href=\"http://fr.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRPAE88S02620120929\" title=\"\">interview with Le Monde this weekend</a>. He defended a \"just\" approach in which the tax burden will fall on big corporations and not small and medium-sized companies, and called upon the 10% richest French people to save the nation's social system. \"Rigorous but leftwing\", cheered the left-leaning Lib\u00e9ration, in a rather Pravda-like fashion.</p> <p>Unlike the worst-affected states of southern Europe, France has apparently not given up on saving its generous social system \u2013 while simultaneously following an orthodox path of deficit reduction. The budget has allowed the country to gain time, and France is currently borrowing on financial markets at record low, sometimes even negative, rates.</p> <p>All this is a far cry from former president Sarkozy's gloomy warning during last spring's election campaign: \"Vote for Hollande and you'll have a Greek-style situation in less than two weeks.\"</p> <p>Hollande's gamble is to put the country's finances in order without having to go through the deep and painful cuts that Spain is imposing on its people, or the hard and equally painful social reforms that Germany underwent years ago.</p> <p>Mission impossible? The answer will emerge in the next few months, in the toughest economic environment possible.</p>",
  "<p>As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/30/edmiliband-labour-conference-2012\" title=\"\">Labour party meets this weekend</a>, its leadership will come under pressure from the trade union movement to show that it has something to offer in place of the coalition's disastrous austerity programme. The TUC is gearing up to march for \"A Future that Works\" in the immediate wake of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tuc\" title=\"\">congress that called for the nationalisation of much of Britain's banking sector</a>. The unions will be demanding something more than \"cuts with a human face\". There is talk of the need for an alternative economic strategy. Not before time.</p> <p>It's not just that we need a growth strategy to replace the coalition's scorched earth austerity policies. There are far deeper problems with the UK economy that explain how we got here and that must be tackled by any future Labour government.</p> <p>The financialisation of the global economy over the last 30 years had a particularly profound effect in Britain as a consequence of the historic economic and political power of the City of London. The period following the big bang in the 1980s left our economy weak and almost uniquely dependent on a bloated financial sector. As a result, manufacturing now accounts for a mere 14% of GDP. Britain's bank debt is higher than the US, Germany or France, equivalent to 460% of GDP, and its economy lags far behind these countries in recovering from the effects of the crash in 2007.</p> <p>To compound this, the financial sector has changed the way companies behave. Its insistence that capital should follow short-term shareholder value has impeded investment in industrial modernisation through research and development. Meanwhile, the City has extended its grip over large areas of social life. The housing market thrives on failing to supply enough affordable homes and City firms and private equity funds siphon off taxpayers money by milking lucrative public service contracts and trading in PFI debt.</p> <p>Reversing this legacy will mean decisively breaking with the neoliberal economic assumptions that led Labour to espouse the efficiency of markets, right up to the moment where they spectacularly failed in 2007. It will mean embracing a comprehensive set of policies aimed at winning control of investment and breaking the grip of the City over political and economic life.</p> <p>Many of these proposals are already widely current on the left, in the labour movement and beyond: public ownership of much of the financial sector, investment in a massive programme of house building to create jobs and kickstart growth; long-term investment in new green industries; new model public services.</p> <p>But these policies cannot be cherry-picked. Instead, they must form part of a coherent strategy aimed at achieving sustainable growth, narrowing inequality, breaking the grip of the City and effecting long-term change through the strategic use of social ownership. The monetarists and neoliberals on the right in the 1980s understood the importance of ownership when they busied themselves introducing a succession of world economies to the doctrines of shock therapy. Now the left must learn the same lesson in reverse.</p> <p>Ownership matters because with it comes democratic control. Labour must be prepared to fully nationalise part of the banking sector, create a democratically controlled investment bank, take public stakes in new companies in strategically important green industries or create new mutuals to enable long-term investment and planned growth. It must be prepared to build socially owned houses again and to regain public control of public services on a newly democratised basis.</p> <p>None of this will go down well with New Labour's votaries at <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Progress</a>. It will play even less well with their friends in the City. Nonetheless, it remains the case that if a progressive government ever really wants to get Britain working again, it must confront the immovable object in the Square Mile with the irresistible force of social ownership.</p>",
  "<p>Al-Jazeera's editorial independence has been called into question after its director of news stepped in to ensure a speech made by Qatar's emir to the UN led its English channel's coverage of the debate on Syrian intervention.</p> <p>Journalists had produced a package of the UN debate, topped with excerpts of President Obama's speech, last Tuesday when a last-minute instruction came from Salah Negm, the Qatar-based news director, who ordered the video to be re-edited to lead with the comments from Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani.</p> <p>Despite protests from staff that the emir's comments \u2013 a repetition of previous calls for Arab intervention in Syria \u2013 were not the most important aspect of the UN debate, the two-minute video was re-edited and Obama's speech was relegated to the end of the package.</p> <p>There are hints at staff dissatisfaction within the film, available for viewing on <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2012/09/201292645421649378.html\" title=\"\">al-Jazeera's website</a> and YouTube, which notes that the emir \"represents one of the smallest countries in the Arab world&#xa0;\u2026 but Qatar has been one of the loudest voices condemning Syria\".</p> <p>The episode left a bitter taste among staff amid complaints that this was the most heavy-handed editorial intervention at the global broadcaster, which has long described itself as operating independent of its Qatari ownership.</p> <p>An al-Jazeera spokesman said the emir's speech was \"a significant development\" that day and the broadcaster \"consequently gave it prominence\".</p> <p>Obama's speech had been carried live, the spokesman added, and the emir's comments were balanced with disagreement from the Egyptian president, Mohammed Morsi.</p> <p>However, insiders said Morsi's contribution had to be taken from an interview with another broadcaster, because none of the world leaders speaking at the UN had, or was, intending to take notice of the emir's comments.</p> <p>Al-Jazeera English was set up in 2006 by the Arabic broadcaster of the same name and both are owned by the Qatari state. The network, founded in 1996, gained credibility with audiences in the region for its seemingly independent coverage in the post 9/11 period.

  "<p>We all know that training budgets are being cut, but demand for learning and development is not going away. From our experience of working with hundreds of UK charities and government bodies each year, we've noticed some training trends that are becoming increasingly prevalent. While typical 'bums-on-seats' training remains an important part of the mix, training managers are increasingly adopting more diverse methods to keep staff up to date. Training topics are not uniform, so why should the methods be?</p> <p>Here are five trends to help your staff get the best from their training.</p> <p><strong>Online Training</strong></p> <p>According to Linden Muirhead, head of digital at the <a href=\"http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Council for Voluntary Organisations</a>, there has been a growing trend for training to be delivered online. We always advise training managers that the success of training depends on delegates' learning preferences. The flexibility of online training will appeal to many as it cuts costs, and allows people to work at their own pace.</p> <p>But you must consider whether online training is appropriate for certain topics or if it is best for everyone. Some delegates find that they miss sharing ideas and questions face-to-face, as in classroom style training. However, as Linden says: \"The key is to encourage people to interact and network online in the same way as they do offline. There's still a culture shift needed to appreciate just how valuable online learning can be.\"</p> <p><strong>Webinars and live Q&amp;A feeds</strong></p> <p>Tools such as webinars and live Q&amp;A feeds are useful as they recreate the interactive element of classroom learning, without the cost and time needed to travel. They offer a good middle way between online and classroom training; they are more personal than online courses and are often live. There is also the added bonus that they can be viewed repeatedly and may be accessible to other learners. There are many organisations that can help you with this type of training, such as <a href=\"http://www.skills-thirdsector.org.uk/qualifications_learning/what_is_links/\" title=\"\">LINKs</a>, which offers webinars and interactive tools for charities, government bodies and social enterprises.</p> <p><strong>Half-day workshops</strong></p> <p>A good half-way point between compacted online training and full training days are half-day workshops, which allow delegates to learn in a group environment when time is tight. Nicola Richards from NDBP1 (formally <a href=\"http://www.npia.police.uk/\" title=\"\">the National Policing Improvement Agency</a>) says: \"When you're really busy even one day away from the office means the emails and tasks build up and all of a sudden you're behind. For me, being able to come into the office before or after the workshop was really useful and allowed me to keep on top of things.\"</p> <p>Some topics may be too dense to fit into half a day, however, and it is worth considering if they will require lengthier training sessions.</p> <p><strong>Peer-to-peer learning</strong></p> <p>Another increasing trend is peer-to-peer learning, including mentoring. This involves direct and personal support from peers via telephone, online methods or face-to-face support, but the idea is that it is flexible to the delegate's needs. Some sector and professional bodies offer a matching service for mentoring. For example, <a href=\"http://www.mediatrust.org/\" title=\"\">Media Trust</a> can match staff with mentors.</p> <p><strong>Blended learning</strong></p> <p>While stand-alone training sessions are useful, often delegates need additional support to fully absorb the content, such as mentoring, advice lines or discussion forums. Integrated learning is key here, and often using a variety of methods that complement each other is the best way to increase delegates' skills and confidence after training. Our <a href=\"http://www.rightsnet.org.uk/docs/rightsnet-services\" title=\"\">rightsnet services</a> are an example of this.</p> <p>Whatever your organisation, training is vital in ensuring that your staff are able to work efficiently. As training managers, identifying the best method for your delegates will help you to utilise your time, money and resources efficiently.</p> <p><em>Alice Arrenberg is the training manager at </em><a href=\"http://www.lasa.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Lasa</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>I always wanted to be a teacher. When I was little I wanted to be primary school teacher. My parents tell me they used to laugh so much at me telling off my imaginary students. Then when I got to secondary school and started to study drama I knew this was the subject I wanted to teach. So it was all planned from the beginning. I had a really inspiring and amusing drama teacher called Peter Rowlands. He lived in Hebden Bridge but came from New Zealand. Peter had trained to teach at <a href=\"http://www.cssd.ac.uk/\">Central School of Speech and Drama</a> so after my drama degree at the <a href=\"http://www.uclan.ac.uk/\">University of Central Lancashire</a> in Preston, I also went to Central to train as a teacher. Peter had a significant affect on me and lots of other students in our A-level class. Almost all them ended up doing something drama related.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.deptfordgreen.lewisham.sch.uk\">Deptford Green School</a> in south east London was my training school, where I spent the first two terms of my teaching qualification. It was a big change coming to London from the small town of Pontefract in West Yorkshire, where I'm from. I'd been to college but that was just a short drive home. This was London. I was nervous; it was the other end of the country. So, it was a real relief to find a school where it was just so lovely and friendly. As soon as I arrived I knew I wanted to stay. I just felt really quickly it was the school I'd have loved to have gone to as a student \u2013 and I think I'd have done much better if I'd been a student here. Despite it being a large inner city school, everyone knew each other. It was warm and friendly. There were really special relationships between students and teachers as well as between teachers.</p> <p>I've realised that you can enjoy teaching in what could be seen as a tough environment if you've got supportive staff. This was an ethos that had been created at the school over a long time. In the past 11 years since I've taught here, a lot of people have left and new teachers have arrived, including a new head five years ago, but that ethos has stayed.</p> <p>We've been a training school for a very long time and a lot of students train in our school and then get a job here as I did. We are no longer technically a training school as the criteria has changed but still take a lot of trainees particularly from <a href=\"http://www.gold.ac.uk/educational-studies/\">Goldsmiths</a> which is just across the road from us, and also the <a href=\"http://www.ioe.ac.uk/\">Institute of Education</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cssd.ac.uk/\">Central</a>. The interesting thing about trainees is they aren't jaded and have lots of ideas. We are all learners, that's our motto at school for teachers as well as students. We're open to taking new ideas and we have been pioneers for citizenship education.</p> <p>Teaching is of course far more complicated than I'd imagined when I decided to be a teacher as a child. Of course I didn't think of all the ins and outs of the way you need to plan and the behaviour management tricks (and there are lots of tricks; when you start you assume if you tell someone off they'll behave, but that's not necessarily the case). And for a drama teacher, and any teacher now, there are no blackboards, which is disappointing.</p> <p>The most amazing thing about teaching is the children. Whether you are doing an assembly or passing a student in the canteen, you'll get a look or smile from someone you've built a relationship with. They are very funny, and I don't mean I'm laughing at them, I mean they are amusing. That's definitely the big draw of teaching for me. I love it in spite of the politics, Ofsted and all the bad stuff. Working with young people makes it worthwhile. Seeing them start school when they are 11 and their bag is five times bigger than they are, then when they are young men and women ready for the next chapter in their lives. This is the first year of our new sixth form at Deptford Green which adds another whole dimension and it's going to be amazing to see our students grow up even more.</p> <p>I started out as a drama teacher and I still teach nine drama lessons a week. Putting on productions is voluntary, but of course it's an expectation of drama and PE teachers that you will run extra curricular stuff and a big part of the job. You put in a lot of extra time but it all pays off. It's so enjoyable and means you have an impact on and know many more students than you actually teach. When you work with students on a show, they are coming in their own time so a very different relationship develops.</p> <p>Now I'm leader of learning at school, so very involved in curriculum development, and one of the assistant heads - so it's not all about drama for me anymore. I play a game of two halves. It's a big change from being a class teacher. There are times when you're having to be really firm with people. When you become part of the senior management your relationships with students and even colleagues will change over time. But students seem good at knowing when you're doing drama and when you're in your other role. I think having a background in drama teaching can really help in a leadership role, in fact our head teacher also used to be a drama teacher. As a drama teacher you have to have a lot of empathy and understand people. The leadership of other adults, getting them on board and encouraging them to up with ideas, all these are skills you develop in drama and theatre - putting on a show is of course the ultimate in team work.</p> <p>I feel I've been really lucky in my career. I've had leadership that has seen what I can do and given me the opportunities to develop, I really enjoy the leadership role and I suppose that's what's made me stay at the school for so long. My role keeps changing so it keeps me interested, keeps me learning.</p> <p>As of this term we have a wonderful new school building, one of the last built under the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jul/05/buried-report-labour-school-building\">Buildings Schools for the Future</a> programme. We badly needed this new school building and being in it has really lifted our spirits. Everything is brighter and cleaner and it feels like a new chapter for the school.</p> <p>My advice to those in training or just starting their teaching career is:</p> <p>\u2022 Try to stay calm and not panic. It's hard. Sometimes it's worth pretending you're calm even if you're not, it can make you feel calmer. If students see you are flapping and running about they'll pick up on it.<br>\u2022 Be organised. It's a tough first few years you've got to keep on top of things.<br>\u2022 Get involved in the life of the school. <br>\u2022 Make allies, you need fellow teachers as your friends.</p> <p>It can be difficult to work out if a school is the right one for you to work in. Visit, take a long look at the website (remember it's marketing but you should be able to get some feel for what the school do). Results are part of it, but not the whole story. If you get a job in a school that ends up not feeling right for you, don't be afraid to go and get another job.</p> <p><em>Ian Paish is assistant headteacher and leader of teaching at <a href=\"http://www.deptfordgreen.lewisham.sch.uk\">Deptford Green School</a> in south east London.</em></p> <p>Ian's favourite resource: <a href=\"http://teachers.guardian.co.uk/teacher-resources/10818/?INTCMP=NECJOBBTN767I2\">Bullying for year 7 tutors</a>.
