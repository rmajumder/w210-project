  "<p>On an industrial estate outside Maidenhead, Heston Blumenthal has a laboratory that doubles as a kitchen in which he spends months on end developing new dishes. Now could be the moment to give a small cupboard of that space to his image and media development team. Heston may be one of the world's most creative and groundbreaking chefs, but in television terms he hit a standstill long ago because he has become a flatscreen one-trick wonder: someone who shouts: \"Look at me\" as he disguises one food to look like another. Even if you had the \u00a3100,000 kitchen to attempt one of his recipes, why on earth would you want to?</p> <p>In his latest outing, <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/hestons-fantastical-food\" title=\"\"><strong>Heston's Fantastical Food</strong></a> (Channel 4) \u2013 programme development time: three nano-seconds \u2013 his glasses appear even bigger than usual. So naturally he's now experimenting with super-sized cooking to make giant versions of everyday meals, starting with breakfast. For someone who has made molecular biology into a culinary art-form, Heston is extremely hazy when it comes to other areas of science. His starting hypothesis was that we are all very grumpy and dissociated because we are skipping breakfast. It's a possibility, I suppose. But then so is the fact that we are in the middle of a global recession and those of us with jobs often face an hour-long journey on public transport in which we are treated as sardines.</p> <p>How then, did Heston test out his theory? By creating a fry-up of two 10kg sausages, baked potatoes masquerading as baked beans and a monster fake egg with a mango yolk, and offering it to people on the station platform on their way to work. That almost everyone declined the invitation was, for Heston, case proved. Though what it more clearly showed was that most people don't allow an extra half an hour in their daily commute on the off-chance they will be asked to be guinea pigs for a television show. So Heston set about making breakfast a fun meal for a select group of commuters by taking over the Orient Express and treating them to his variations of boiled egg, cereals and coffee vapours. Everyone smiled, whooped and talked to each other. QED.</p> <p>What was objectionable about all this wasn't Heston \u2013 he's an acquired taste, but on the whole I can take him \u2013 but the fundamental conceit that what he was doing was in some way useful. It wasn't; it was just Heston having a bit of a laugh and trying his hand at something not even he will bother to do again. Which is fine, if you like that kind of thing, but I could have done without the endless padding that came with it. This was a 20 minute programme stretched to an hour. Heston has long traded off things being not quite what they seem. He's succeeded once more. Only this time he turned everything into a turkey.</p> <p>There was better science and more entertainment to be had on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00zxmqd\" title=\"\"><strong>Dara \u00d3&#xa0;Briain's Science Club</strong></a> (BBC2), the latest in the long production line of programmes designed to cash in on the media's latest discovery: that science can be both fun and interesting, even without the soulful eyes and boy-band looks of Brian Cox to present it. Though, for many, the appearance of the Guardian's dreamy science correspondent Alok Jha will have more than made up for Cox's absence.</p> <p>First up for discussion was sex. It's hard to go far wrong with sex, but \u00d3&#xa0;Briain's guided tour of the subject was conducted with considerable panache in making the complex comprehensible. It helps that \u00d3&#xa0;Briain is a naturally funny and intelligent man, but what makes him so good on television is that he comes across as a very generous presenter; someone who doesn't need to hog the camera and isn't afraid to let his guests take centre stage. And up stepped Professor Steve Jones, one of the world's leading geneticists \u2013 and certainly one of the driest \u2013 to give a master-class in popular science education. His observations that the bicycle was one of the key developments in human evolution \u2013 people no longer had to have sex with those on their doorstep \u2013 and that Francis Galton had concluded that Britain's least attractive women could be found in Aberdeen, will stay with me long after I have forgotten what epigenetics actually is.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's biggest arms companies collaborated secretly with ministers, Whitehall officials and the CIA to find a way of 'stifling' the Saudi opposition leader, Mohammed al-Mas'ari, according to a confidential report by the chief executive of the defence firm, Vickers, which has been leaked to the Guardian.</p> <p>The internal Vickers memorandum, written by Sir Colin Chandler - formerly head of arms exports at the Ministry of Defence - provides an extraordinary insight into the relationship between government and the defence industry and their common determination to neutralise the threat to multi-billion pound contracts posed by the presence of Saudi dissidents in London.</p> <p>The memo, dated last September 6, reveals that Britain passed to Saudi Arabia secret intelligence on Saddam Hussein to appease Saudi anger over Mr Mas'ari's activities in London. The document also refers to 'direct Saudi intervention' against the prominent Saudi dissident, now threatened with deportation to Dominica, and attempts to 'stifle him personally'.</p> <p>In a three-page note to David Hastie - Vickers's international relations director and another former MoD official - Sir Colin describes a discussion with Dick Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace, who reported anxiety in the CIA 'and their counterparts in this country' about the impact of Mr Mas'ari's campaign against the Saudi royal family and the presence of Western troops in the kingdom.</p> <p>Yesterday Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, declared that the rights of political refugees had to be weighed against British economic interests. Speaking in Delhi, he said not to have taken action against Mr Mas'ari would have been detrimental to Britain and would have cost jobs.</p> <p>As well as the exchanges with Mr Evans and Mike Rouse of British Aerospace, the Vickers memo refers to contacts with Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, over the Mas'ari case. Based on the al-Yamamah deal signed by Margaret Thatcher in the mid-1980s, all three firms depend on huge Saudi deals or hope to secure them soon.</p> <p>Vickers, British Aerospace, GKN and VSEL are negotiating aeronautical or defence sales worth pounds 3 billion.</p> <p>Highlighting the symbiotic relationship between the arms firms and various branches of government, the Vickers memo records Sir Colin and BAe's chief executive proposing jointly that the Government try to 'offset some of the Saudi criticism of us' by inviting President Saddam's son-in-law - who defected to Jordan last August - to Britain and then 'feeding some of the intelligence back to the kingdom'.</p> <p>Sir Colin was later telephoned by Andrew Green - recently appointed ambassador to Saudi Arabia - who told him that a British debriefing had already taken place in Amman and 'material had been passed to both King Fahd and the Saudi foreign minister'. This had 'earned us many plaudits'.</p> <p>It emerged last night that Mr Green has been a non-executive director of Vickers since April 1994. He joined the company in a Whitehall scheme designed to improve links with industry, a Foreign Office spokeswoman said.</p> <p>She added: 'There's no conflict of interest. It's a very logical choice that Mr Green should be appointed ambassador to Riyadh and advise Vickers.</p> <p>'Vickers is a company that is interested in that part of the world. That does not suggest anything improper.'</p> <p>The Vickers memo shows the British arms manufacturers are closely involved in Saudi palace intrigue, backing Prince Sultan, who Sir Colin makes clear is regarded as crucial to their contracts.</p> <p>Sir Colin records a 'general feeling' in intelligence and business circles that 'direct Saudi intervention' against Mr Mas'ari 'could be difficult because he is, as you probably know, the son of a leading cleric' in the kingdom.</p> <p>Last night Vickers refused to comment on the contents of Sir Colin's memorandum. A Foreign Office spokesman said it could make no comment 'on what appears to be leaked information'.</p> <h2>The Vickers memorandum, written by Sir Colin Chandler </h2> <p>To: Mr J. D. Hastie</p> <p>From: Sir Colin Chandler</p> <p>cc: Mr J. A. Crowther</p> <p>Float</p> <p>David,</p> <p>MOHAMMED AL-MAS'ARI</p> <p>Bearing in mind the importance of Saudi Arabia to British Aerospace, I had a word with Dick Evans on the telephone about this dissident, on 31st August. What Dick told me was rather interesting, and shed some new light on facets of this problem that perhaps we had not known before.</p> <p>It appears that King Fahd had for a time not been altogether unhappy about the activities of al-Mas'ari (spelt Al-Misari thoughout the memorandum). Most of the dissidents' attacks have been directed at Prince Sultan and, as you know, the relationship between the two brothers is not always a happy one. The king has therefore enjoyed a certain amount of schadenfreude at his brother's discomfort. But even the king recognises that this cannot go on much longer, particularly because the content of recent messages from al-Mas'ari has become much more serious.</p> <p>Apparently, some of the recent messages directed at the religious community have attempted to incite the mullahs to criticise the royal family, even to suggest that they should stir up the people of Saudi Arabia against the family, ie. try to provoke them into a coup. That particular aspect has, of course, got King Fahd worried. In addition, other members of the family have been annoyed that the king has taken no action to date and has appeared disinterested. In any event, and despite the king's apparent disdain, we all recognise the importance of Prince Sultan in the defence deal and the actions that have been taken by British Aerospace have been mainly to try and calm the local situation by playing down the importance of our al-Mas'ari.</p> <p>Another more disturbing turn recently has been that the dissidents' messages have also tried to stir the local populace and religious community against expatriates working in the kingdom. These have been mainly directed at the Americans but more recently have also been directed at the British. This starts to bring al-Mas'ari's activities into an area where some action might be taken. This is because these recent activities could be tantamount to inciting a form of terrorism and certainly the US authorities, and in particular the CIA, have become much more interested and, according to Dick, are in some dialogue with their counterparts in this country. As you can imagine Evans said that he was in close contact with his 'friend' in the United States on this subject.</p> <p>There was a general feeling that al-Mas'ari will win his appeal when it comes up in February or so next year and, in any event, direct Saudi intervention against him could be difficult because he is, as you probably know, the son of a leading cleric in the kingdom.</p> <p>Turning to a point which I had never heard before, the taking of action against him actually sending messages is currently virtually impossible because he is accessing the internet, occasionally through the United States, but also through other countries. There is, as yet, no international law which can deal with messages sent on the internet because it is almost impossible to trace the country of origin. Dick went on to add that Mick Rouse and BAe security people were constantly examining the problem to see if solutions could be found.</p> <p>He liked my suggestion that HMG might try to offset some of the Saudi criticism of us by inviting Saddam Hussein's son-in-law to visit the UK for an intelligence debrief and then feeding some of that intelligence back to the kingdom. Dick said he would join in supporting it with the Foreign Office.</p> <p>Andrew Green subsequently telephoned to say that British debriefing had been carried out in Amman and material had been passed to both King Fahd and the Saudi foreign minister. This had earned us many plaudits.</p> <p>Incidentally, Andrew's appointment as HMA Riyadh is not yet official. The Queen has not formally approved it and the Saudis have yet to give 'agreement'. If, as expected, the approvals are obtained, he would take up the post in March 1996.</p> <p>Since I dictated this note I had a conversation with Sir David Lees on this subject and another one with Mike Rouse. David Lees is of the mind to write to Michael Heseltine, just as I did. He also suggested that he, Dick Evans and I meet to discuss the subject which I am very happy to go along with.</p> <p>Mike Rouse took a more relaxed attitude about the activities of al-Mas'ari, saying that in his view some of Mas'ari's outbursts were becoming so outrageous that even the Saudis were not taking him very seriously. We all recognise that Prince Sultan may choose to take a different view completely but in Mike's view we should not do much now to let Mas'ari feel that he is important. It is something of a question of giving him enough rope . . . etc. In any event, Mike added, there are plenty of other people in Mas'ari's organisation who would soon take his place should an attempt be made to stifle him personally.</p> <p>I told Mike about the suggestion from David Lees about a meeting, he thought that was a good idea and will prepare a brief for Dick ready for that event.</p> <p>Colin</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Seventeen years ago, a Manchester City side with a central midfield pairing of Steve Lomas and Garry Flitcroft were about halfway through the decline that saw them go from fifth in the top-flight to mid-table in the third tier in the space of six and a half seasons. An Ajax side containing Frank Rijkaard, Clarence Seedorf, Jari Litmanen and Patrick Kluivert (<em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_UEFA_Champions_League_Final\">on the bench</a></em>) had just won the European Cup. How times change. City now have more dough than a workaholic baker, while the Amsterdam club haven't gone beyond the group stages in the Champions League since 2005-06 and can consider themselves to be on something of an upswing having actually made the tournament proper for the last couple of seasons. They're clubs who seem poles apart these days in outlook and expectation, which is why it was such a shock a fortnight ago when Frank de Boer's side piled the pressure on Roberto Mancini with a 3-1 win over the English champions.</p> <p>Yet Ajax are in pretty miserable shape in the Eredivisie. They've not won in four attempts and lost 2-0 at home to Vitesse at the weekend. They are fifth, but trail the leaders, FC Twente, by 10 points, the same gap that separates them from 16th-place PEC Zwolle. And while domestically they've been, like Hard Fi's third single, hard to beat (yes, a seven-year-old musical reference counts as bleeding edge to me), in Europe they've been, like Hard Fi's ninth single, good for nothing (yes I had to look that up). That is until City rocked up at the Amsterdam Arena and watched as the home side partied like it was 1995. </p> <p>Still, the Dutch giants are supposed to be the whipping boys in Group D and City are huge odds-on favourites tonight. Anything other than a win and Mancini's side can pretty much kiss goodbye to the Champions League for another season and Mancini himself can start thinking about polishing up the CV that had seven or eight clubs clamouring over his services towards the end of last season.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>The teams are in:</strong></p> <p><strong>Man City:</strong> Hart, Zabaleta, Kompany, Nastasic, Clichy, Javi Garcia, Barry, Nasri, Toure, Aguero, Tevez. Subs: Pantilimon, Maicon, Dzeko, Sinclair, Kolarov, Balotelli, Meppen-Walter. <br><strong>Ajax:</strong> Vermeer, Van Rhijn, Alderweireld, Moisander, Blind, De Jong, Poulsen, Schone, Boerrigter, Eriksen, Babel. Subs: Cillessen, Enoh, Sana, Veltman, Denswil, Dijks, Fischer. <br><strong>Referee:</strong> Peter Rasmussen (Denmark)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>So Ajax look like they've stuck with the 4-3-3 that served them so well in Amsterdam</strong> while Mancini looks to have opted for solidity and a three-man midfield wall of Garcia, Barry and Tour\u00e9.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>7.25pm: Just over quarter of an hour til kick-off. How do I know? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj6LRs_8Uzo#t=41s\">Because I've just seen this</a>. That and the clocks, obviously. We have clocks.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Here's Bobby Manc:</strong> \"They [the players] don't need to have my passion. They need to play football like they can.\"</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>ADVERTS, ADVERTS, ADVERTS \u2026</strong> Gamble, get new car insurance, get a new telly (I think \u2026), drink Australian beer, buy a games console \u2026</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>PEEP!</strong> Off we go then. City in sky blue, Ajax in a hideous lime green and deep blue away monstrosity.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Nasri wriggles some space on the edge of the area but opts not to shoot, then Tour\u00e9 tumbles optimistically in the box.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Babel charges at Kompany with the ball at his feet, but the City centre-half stays cool and nicks the ball away with little fuss.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Eriksen unfurls the first shot of the game, but it makes it little more than five yards before it slaps into a City rump.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Eriksen bounces off Toure in midfield and City flood forward. Aguero shoots. Deflected over. Corner. Claimed by Vermeer.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> \"I've never liked Wenger (for so many reasons...)\" begins Matt Dony, \"but I've always thought that, had he bought Babel, he would've made an absolute star out of him. For all Benitez's tactical sharpness, he didn't seem to develop players as well as some other managers. But now it's probably too late for Babel to really fulfil his potential. Good player, not a great player.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Nasri feeds the ball through to Zabaleta. It's a decent chance for the full-back, but he blazes over.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Nastasic skews Van Rhijn's low cross behind for an Ajax corner \u2026</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Man City 0-1 Ajax (De Jong 9)</strong> Holy cow! How did that go in? From City's point of view it's softer than Mr Soft's soft underbelly. The corner isn't dealt with by the Nastasic, the ball is prodded back across goal and from the tightest of tight angles the Ajax captain lofts the ball over Hart and into the roof of the net.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> City are stung into action and look for an immediate response. Tevez forces a couple of corners. From the second Nastacic squeezes of a shot as the ball drops but it's straight at Vermeer. The visitors are sitting Mariana Trench-deep, though, inviting pressure.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> \"I think that goal is one of those megalolz that the kids are talking about nowadays,\" reckons Graeme Neill. To be honest, I wouldn't know a megalol if it painted itself purple and danced naked on top of a harpsichord, singing 'Megalolz are here again.\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> The Etihad is quiet. Very quiet.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Sch\u00f6ne puts Babel away down the left channel, and the former Liverpool man does well to win a corner \u2026</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Man City 0-2 Ajax (De Jong 17)</strong> \u2026 and it's another! And it's De Jong again! This time he gets across the front to meet a near-post inswinger and guides a free header past Joe Hart. Marking? What marking? If Manchester City were a pair of trainers they'd be allowed on a badminton court.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Tevez sparks panic in the Ajax backline with another low cross. The visitors clear for a corner, then deal with that.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Two corners for Ajax, two goals. You can have all the rinky-dink passing options up front that you like but set pieces are such a huge part of the game. The Ajax fans are singing Always Look on the Bright Side Of Life.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester City 1-2 Ajax (Tour\u00e9 22)</strong> And City now at least have a bright side to look on. Again they attack down the right. The cross falls to Tour\u00e9 at the back post and the Ivorian chests down before volleying acrobatically past Verbeer.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> That was something a bit special from Tour\u00e9, but to be honest City have looked dangerous whenever they've gone forward.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Kompany gets to Boerrigter's cross just ahead of Sch\u00f6ne as Ajax foray forward.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Nasri crosses. Zabaleta shoots. Deflected. It's looping in. It's headed away by Van Rhijn. If I had a \u00a31, the time, and the predilection for compulsive gambling, my \u00a31 would still be on a home win here.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> In the other game in Group D, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/matches\">Dortmund have gone ahead in the Bernab\u00e9u</a>.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Javi Garc\u00eda lofts in a beautiful sand-wedge of a pass in towards the ever-impressive Zabaleta who has burst through the Ajax backline like an Alien through John Hurt's stomach. He shows none of the predatory instincts of the aforementioned extra terrestrial, however, and can only guide his header gently into the arms of Vermeer.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Ajax seem to have weathered the initial storm after Tour\u00e9's goal. De Jong smites an effort at goal from 30-odd yards, but it trundles well wide.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Pepe has equalised for Real in Spain, but that's all irrelevant if the score stays the same in Manchester.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Barry attempts to thread the ball through for Tour\u00e9 on halfway, but he's only succeeds in finding a clump of Ajax players. The visitors beginning to dominate the ball now.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Ajax have done very well to suck the wind from City's sails and the noise from the terraces. City have barely had a touch in the last five or 10 minutes and there's barely been a peep from the crowd.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> De Jong sloppily gives the ball away 30 yards from his own goal, but City can't quite plough through.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Tevez goes down on the edge of the box, but the referee makes that wavey-scoopy-get-up-get-up motion with his arms and we play on.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> It's been a bad night for Ag\u00fcero, Barry and Nasri thus far. Nastasic is still to convince too.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Grumblegrumblegrumble go the terraces as City work the ball back to Hart rather than go forward.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> With seconds until the break, City force a corner \u2026</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> \u2026&#xa0;Vermeer flaps, but gets enough on it.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>PEEP!</strong> And that's the break. A pretty even half in the end.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Balotelli is out on the Etihad pitch, warming up.</strong> Looks like he'll be on after the break. Wouldn't be surprised to see Nasri give way.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>And indeed Balotelli is coming on</strong> but it's Javi Garcia who is to be replaced</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>PEEP!</strong> Ajax get the second half underway.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> DOOF! Blind goes hammering into Nasri and gets a booking for his trouble. It looked nasty but replays show the Ajax left-back slipped on his way in to the challenge, to be fair.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Vermeer gathers the resultant free-kick.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Ag\u00fcero skitters through looking dangerous on the edge of the box, but his footing goes at the worst possible moment and Ajax clear.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Tour\u00e9 comes steamrollering out of defence like a runaway tank. His pass finds Ag\u00fcero, whose legs are found by the feet of Alderweireld. No free-kick given, but then Tevez tumbles on the left edge of the box and City do have their free-kick. It's a dangerous one \u2026</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Barry zips it in at knee height to Nastasic, but his first-time effort soars over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> At the other end, Babel hoofs a cross hopelessly out of play for a goal kick.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Tevez goes down again on the edge of the D. Free-kick. This is a real chance \u2026</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> \u2026 Tour\u00e9 pings it into the top of the wall, Clichy prods the rebound back into Aguero, who tucks it past the onrushing Vermeer. Celebrations are cut short by the linesman's flag. The Argentine was a yard offside.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Tour\u00e9 thunders into the box. Ajax don't even bother trying to stop him, but his pass into the six-yard box is cleared away. It's one-way traffic at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> De Jong is given space enough for a four-bed detached house and a sizeable garage around 30 yards from goal. His effort is sweetly struck, but Joe Hart claws the ball away.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Vermeer does well to smother a cross as Aguero closes in.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Vermeer goes all Jackson Pollock as he rushes out for a through ball. Aguero nicks it past him and gets to the byline. As he turns, looking up to see who'll get a simple tap in in the middle, his feet give way <em>again</em> and the chance goes begging.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Ajax have offered almost nothing this half. They've not been allowed to get their pass, pass, pass, pass, passpasspasspasspasspass stuff going.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Ajax force a corner \u2026</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> \u2026&#xa0;Ajax, having taken two corners and scored two goals, decide to <em>take it short</em>. I mean really. It's cleared. Obviously.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Tour\u00e9 \u2026 Tevez \u2026 Barry \u2026 that bloke in the parka in the third row, some 20 yards wide of goal.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Mancini unleashes Dzeko. Off comes Tevez.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Ajax do get time for some pass, pass, pass, pass, passpasspasspasspasspass which ends up with Van Rhijn on the right, who flashes a low ball across the six-yard box. Zabaleta has to put behind, but this time City, courtesy of Joe Hart's Fist of Fury, deal with the corner.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Eriksen, so elegant he should be playing in a ball gown, helps Ajax work the ball through midfield once more. And they win a dangerous free-kick \u2026</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> \u2026 De Jong spanks it goalwards and Hart makes a flying save to his left.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> City have gone flatter than the mill pond in Flat Stanley's back garden.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester City 2-2 Ajax (Aguero 74)</strong> Which, of course, is a notoriously lively mill pond, with lots of waves and whirlpools and the like. Hart boots long, Balotelli heads on, and Aguero skitters on to the ball and prods beyond Vermeer.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Moisander times a challenge perfectly to deny Zabaleta as he charges into the box. Ajax are facing a tricky 15 minutes here.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> City break with frightening speed but Aguero is (wrongly) judged offside from Clichy's header. That all started when Balotelli battled back to pinch Eriksen's pocket 30 yards from the City goal.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Nasri dinks in a free-kick, Balotelli sends a firm header towards goal and Vermeer sprawls to his left to make a flashy save.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Ag\u00fcero goes down on the left edge of the area under Poulsen's challenge. Another dangerous free-kick \u2026</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> \u2026 Blind does well to get his head on Nasri's centre.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Van Rhijn sends in another cross so vicious it has it's own theme music and finishing move. It's a corner for Ajax, but City have sorted themselves out and again clear.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Poulsen goes into the referee's Big Book of Very Bad Boys for a tug on Balotelli.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Kolarov replaces Barry and his first act is to win a corner.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Eventually Kolarov gets the chance to slide in a cross from the edge of the box, but Dzeko gets caught in two minds and can only sidefoot wide.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> <strong>GOA \u2026 NO OFFSIDE!</strong> Dzeko prods through to Kolarov, and his centre is turned in by Aguero. The flag goes up, though.

  "<p>The 2012 campaign began before the campaign of 2008 had finished. In February of that year, while Barack Obama was still locked in an epic struggle for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton, Mitt Romney summoned his closest allies to a Boston office to work out why his effort to be the Republicans' standard-bearer of 2008 had failed so badly. He handed out a memo he had written about himself, detailing his strengths and weaknesses, assessing his own defeated candidacy as if it were one of the businesses he once assessed as a hotshot management consultant. This was no mere exercise in navel-gazing. Romney was determined to learn the lessons of defeat in 2008 in order to win in 2012.</p> <p>Thus began a long march that ended today. The visible miles came last winter, when Romney trudged through the pig farms of Iowa and the snows of New Hampshire in his search for the Republican nomination. But that followed an invisible primary, an endless round of closed-door fundraisers to fill up a war-chest he hoped would scare off the most fearsome potential rivals.</p> <p>Whether money was the explanation or not, Romney was indeed rewarded by the decision of several big-beast Republicans not to challenge him for the nomination. The New Jersey governor Chris Christie, Indiana's Mitch Daniels and others, including Sarah Palin, skipped the race, leaving the path open for Romney.</p> <p>When ambitious politicians duck a presidential contest, that's usually because they suspect the incumbent will be too hard to dislodge. In the summer of 2011, that looked like the smart decision. For Obama had just done what George W Bush had failed to do: he had removed \u2013 killed \u2013 Osama bin Laden. Many Republicans concluded that, given the US economy was bound to at least slightly improve by November 2012, the scalp of Bin Laden made the president tough to beat.</p> <p>The course for Romney ran anything but smooth. Instead of warming to the former Massachusetts governor as the obvious choice \u2013 a successful businessman who looked like Hollywood's idea of a president \u2013 Republican primary voters seemed ready to fall in love with almost anyone but him. The field of rivals included outlandish characters who seemed absurd to outsiders: pizza magnate Herman Cain, evolution-denying congresswoman Michelle Bachmann, Texas governor Rick Perry, who could not remember which three government departments he planned to shut down. Former McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt said: \"The Republican primary resembled a reality-TV show. All these guys might as well have been living in a tree house with Simon Cowell.\"</p> <p>And yet each of those candidates enjoyed a moment in the sun, a surge in support that made them \u2013 rather than Romney \u2013 the frontrunner. It was as if Republicans were desperate to find someone else to nominate. Accordingly, former senator Rick Santorum and the former House speaker Newt Gingrich won enough states between them to ensure the primary race dragged on.</p> <p>That long, bruising primary battle cost Romney dear, and not just financially (it forced him to spend money defeating his fellow Republicans rather than saving it for the fight against Obama). The greater cost was political.</p> <p>It exposed the future Republican nominee to sustained attack from his own side. The notion of Romney as a ruthless plutocrat, coldly laying off American workers, did not come from the Democrat attack machine. Romney was not seen as embodying the 1% because of the Occupy movement. Rather, that portrait was drawn by Gingrich, who aired an extended commercial, \"When Mitt Romney came to Town\", that tore apart Romney's tenure at the helm of the private equity firm Bain &amp; Co. It depicted him as a corporate raider, willing to shutter factories and shatter working lives if it made him richer. That critique lingered all year, eagerly picked up and advanced by the Democrats. But it originated with the Republicans.</p> <p>Still, the damage of the primaries went deeper. To push aside Santorum, Bachmann and the others, Romney was obliged to adopt positions that would endear him to the Republican faithful \u2013 but which stored up trouble for later. So Romney reversed his previous support for abortion rights and gun control, called on undocumented migrants to \"self-deport\" and rebranded himself from a Massachusetts moderate, who as governor had passed healthcare reform, into the \"severe conservative\" who now promised to repeal \"Obamacare\".</p> <p>Those reverses left him doubly wounded. For one thing, he could now be slammed as a serial flip-flopper, just another politician who believed in nothing and would say whatever it took to be elected. For another, he had been boxed into a series of positions bound to alienate core blocs of the electorate that had long been tough for Republicans to reach \u2013 the young, Latinos and suburban women among them.</p> <p>Sure enough, through the summer months he was on the receiving end of an air assault from Obama, in the form of saturation TV ads in key states, which portrayed Romney as part boardroom vulture, part unprincipled phoney. Obama, who had faced no primary challenge of his own, had the money to do it \u2013 defining Romney before he had a chance to define himself.</p> <p>Yet Romney could not just blame Obama. Much of his trouble was of his own making. He helped colour in the cartoon of himself as an out-of-touch one percenter when he boasted that his wife had \"a couple of Cadillacs\" or when his tax returns \u2013 showing that he paid a meagre 14% \u2013 had to be dragged out of him. In July, he botched an overseas tour meant to boost his credentials as a potential world leader by offending America's most easily pleased ally, Britain, when he suggested the London Olympics could be a flop and by travelling to Jerusalem to offer his view that cultural inferiority might be the cause of Palestinian suffering.</p> <p>What should have been a moment to relaunch his candidacy and make Americans look at him anew \u2013 his party convention in Tampa in August \u2013 also had little effect. His speech was overshadowed by a moment of Dadaist theatre, as Clint Eastwood harangued an empty chair standing in for an imaginary Obama. Romney was on his way to becoming a joke figure.</p> <p>In September, he went from being ridiculed to being hated. A leaked video showed him addressing fellow millionaires at a fundraising event in May, where an unplugged Romney candidly wrote off 47% of the electorate as parasites, non-taxpaying dependents who would never vote Republican because they would not \"take responsibility for their own lives\". Even many on his own side believed it was an act of self-destruction so complete that no candidate could possibly survive it.</p> <p>But Romney had one more chance. The first TV debate in Denver on 3 October was, for many Americans, the first time they had paid close attention to the election. What they saw was an incumbent president who looked exhausted, listless and disengaged. With his head down, his answers sluggish, it seemed he either was too tired to be president or no longer really wanted the job.</p> <p>Romney, by contrast, was spirited and energetic. Above all, he came across as a human being rather than the caricature of Obama propaganda: all he had to do was not seem like a rapacious capitalist bloodsucker and, in an instant, he had broken the core message of the Obama campaign. The immediate bounce that Romney enjoyed in the polls suggested that a small chunk of the electorate, disenchanted with the president, had been waiting to see if the Republican was a plausible replacement. In Denver Romney crossed that threshold.</p> <p>That change revealed what had always been the structural reality of this race. By rights, it should always have been close. Here was an incumbent president who had struggled to lift his approval rating above 50%, who had seen the number of Americans saying the US was on the \"wrong track\" become a majority and, most crucially, had watched as the unemployment rate had remained stuck at 8% for almost his entire presidency, shifting below that figure only a matter of weeks ago. The last president to be re-elected with a jobless percentage that high was Franklin Roosevelt in 1940, in what were rather different circumstances.</p> <p>So the election should never have been a cakewalk for Obama. That it had seemed that way, until Denver, attested to the deeply flawed candidacy of Romney. By raising his game at that first debate, he restored politics to something like normal service.</p> <p>Obama conceded that he had messed up, joked that he had been napping in the first encounter and sharpened up for the next two, where he remained clear, focused and unafraid to confront his opponent: in Denver he had failed even to mention Romney's 47% remark. Now he made it his closing argument.</p> <p>But October was a tough month for the president. He was hobbled by accusations that he had bungled or even deceived the public over the September killing of four US diplomats in Benghazi, an issue unlikely to go away. Still the end of the month brought some unlikely and helpful allies.</p> <p>The first was a former nemesis, Bill Clinton, who in 2008 had dismissed Obama's presidential bid as a \"fairytale\". In the campaign's closing days, Obama let the man they call the big dog run \u2013 as the country's most beloved Democrat grew hoarse making the case for his successor. Obama didn't just exploit Clinton's ability to connect to the white, male blue-collar Americans who remain beyond the current president's reach \u2013 he all but ran on Clinton's record, arguing that \"We know my plan works because we've tried it,\" referring to Clinton's success in the 1990s.</p> <p>The second ally was a genuine surprise. Some pollsters doubt that Superstorm Sandy really made a big difference for Obama, noting that Romney's surge, \"Mittmentum\", had already stalled before the weather changed. But few deny that Obama benefited from the chance to be seen doing the job of president, while Romney was sidelined, and profited especially from the bearhug he received from the Republicans' rising star, Chris Christie. His gushing praise for Obama, and refusal to campaign at Romney's side in Pennsylvania, was precious validation for the president \u2013 and it came at just the right time.</p> <p>And so the two men duelled to the very last, Romney making two campaign convention-breaking stops on election day itself. The campaign had finished, but the politics is anything but over.</p>",
  "<p>When he is voted in unopposed as the chairman of the British Olympic Association on Wednesday, Lord Coe will be at once joining an organisation on the crest of a wave and in some difficulty. On the one hand, it has just played a major part in delivering the best British performance at an Olympic Games in over a century, under the unremitting glare of a home Games. On the other, it faces long-running questions over its finances and remit amid a looming debate over the post-Games sporting landscape. But the appointment of Coe, London 2012's figurehead with a large reservoir of political, public and international goodwill to draw on, will give it the best opportunity possible to face those challenges \u2013 assuming he can devote enough time to them amid his portfolio existence. Among the challenges in his in-tray are:</p> <h2><strong>Finances</strong></h2> <p>Before taking the job, Coe sought assurances that the BOA's creaky finances would not damage his ability to do it. Dismal sales of BOA scarves and medallions during the Games, not to mention a long-running row with Coe's Locog over the deal that originally licensed the Olympic rings to the 2012 organisers, left the BOA's balance sheet in a parlous state. Its 2011 accounts revealed a \u00a3411,000 loss but the more serious impact will be felt this year when the full cost of delivering the 550-strong British team to the Games are taken into account. In its recent accounts, it revealed that it had extended its overdraft to \u00a35m for the first quarter of next year. There is also an ongoing debate about whether it should lobby for a share of public money for some areas of its operation \u2013 such as the museum it wants to build on the Olympic Park and the Get Set educational programme it has inherited from Locog \u2013 or remain entirely independent of government.</p> <h2><strong>Legacy</strong></h2> <p>Coe was once fond of saying it was for others to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2012/oct/18/olympic-legacy-london-2012-lord-coe?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">deliver on the legacy created by the Games</a>. But his decision to accept an offer from the prime minister David Cameron to be a government adviser and cheerleader for the Olympic legacy and an entreaty from the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, to take on the BOA role have left him among those who will be judged on whether the promises he made to secure the Olympics are being kept. The success of the Games has not only given the BOA a platform to exploit but also left Britain's standing at an all-time high among the global sporting community. A bid for the 2018 Youth Olympic Games has already been submitted on behalf of Glasgow, but it will be for Coe to decide how else best to capitalise.</p> <h2><strong>Role</strong></h2> <p>A long overdue debate on the respective roles and responsibilities of the alphabet soup of British sports administration bodies had been put off until after the Games. A full-blown merger of UK Sport, the Olympic funding agency with which the BOA under outgoing chairman Lord Moynihan regularly clashed, and grassroots body Sport England is likely to be put on ice in favour of streamlining their operations and moving to new offices. Before the Games, Moynihan had spoken ambitiously about the BOA taking a lead role in coaching, school sport and a host of other areas that could lead to clashes and overlap. Coe's task will be to define what sort of organisation he wants the BOA to be and where it should sit in the overall sporting landscape. Given his success at bringing together previously warring factions to deliver the Games, Coe will be expected to build a consensus \u2013 nationally and internationally. His task is likely to be helped if long-time friend and ally Sir Keith Mills takes on a role as chairman of both UK Sport and Sport England, as some in government want.</p> <h2><strong>Staff</strong></h2> <p> Ahead of the arrival of the new chairman, the BOA chief executive, Andy Hunt, presented a restructuring plan to the board designed to streamline the number of senior staff and save money \u2013 and potentially cement his own position in the process. The departure of Sir Clive Woodward, although by his own volition, will also help save money. Under the plan, the number of divisional directors will be reduced from 11 to seven and the overall headcount from 87 to 52, including an unspecified number of redundancies. Coe will have to pilot the organisation through this morale-sapping period and emerge the other side with a clearer idea of its future role.</p> <h2><strong>Commercial</strong></h2> <p>The rationale behind the investment by Moynihan and Hunt \u2013 who expanded the commercial team ahead of the Games \u2013 was the lure of the rewards on offer once the rights to the Olympic rings return to the organisation at the beginning of next year. But aside from a new contract with Adidas and a marketing deal with the International Olympic Committee's commercial partners, which will bring in \u00a313m over the next four years, there has been little progress in getting other deals over the line. The hope is that Coe's longstanding links at the highest levels with some of the biggest multinationals, and Locog's success in delivering more than \u00a3700m of sponsorship incomedespite the global recession, will help seal more of those deals.</p>",

  "<p>An increasing middle-class \"brain drain\" of British professionals moving abroad to live and work is raising concerns about future skills shortages in the UK, <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/immigration-asylum-research/horr68/\" title=\"\">Home Office research</a> has found.</p> <p>The study of emigration from Britain reveals that an estimated 4.7 million UK-born people now live abroad, with Australia consistently the most popular destination over the past 20 years.</p> <p>The research also discloses that, contrary to popular wisdom, fewer people emigrate from Britain at times of rising unemployment as they find it harder to sell-up and fund their move abroad. This is in sharp contrast to the era of the \"\u00a310 Pom\" 50 years ago when 80,000 impoverished British migrants a year used to sign up for an assisted passage to Australia.</p> <p>The study found that those moving abroad are overwhelmingly (93%) of working age and that the popular image of Brits retiring to the Spanish Costas is in decline. Only 4,000 people of retirement age moved abroad in 2010, down from a peak of 22,000 in 2006. The fall reflects the end of the house price bubble in Britain during which homeowners could sell up and live more cheaply abroad, while enjoying the better climate and quality of life. The largest numbers of British pensioners living abroad are not in Spain at all but are to be found in Australia, Canada and the US, reflecting the large British communities who settled in those countries years ago.</p> <p>The Office of National Statistics says emigration from Britain rose sharply over the past decade from 363,000 a year to a peak of 427,000 in 2008. Since then it has fallen back to 350,000 a year. Long-term migrants are defined as those who move abroad for at least 12 months.</p> <p>British emigrants account for 149,000 or 43% of the 350,000 who left Britain to live abroad during 2011. The remaining 57% were made up of almost equal numbers of European Union and non-EU citizens returning home after living and working in Britain.</p> <p>It also found that citizens of other EU countries, who face shorter travel distances and lower costs, are far more likely to return home after living in Britain than those from the rest of the world. Migrants from the Indian sub-continent and the Caribbean Commonwealth countries are also more likely to settle in Britain than those who come to live in Britain from Australia, New Zealand or America.</p> <p>The Home Office study says a large and increasing proportion of British citizens moving abroad are those from the professional or managerial occupations and this has implications for the future availability of skills in Britain.</p> <p>This group made up just over a third or 37% of British emigrants in 1991 but reached nearly half or 48% in 2010 after a steady year-on-year rise until the global recession of 2008. Most moved abroad to a definite job rather than simply speculative looking for work.</p> <p>The most recent estimate by the World Bank shows that in 2011 there were 4.7 million British citizens living abroad, representing 7% of the total UK population and the eighth highest of any country in terms of absolute numbers. In percentage terms, countries such as Portugal (21%) and Ireland (16%) have much higher proportions of their population living abroad.</p> <p>The largest British communities around the world are in Australia (1.2 million), the US (701,000), Canada (675,000) and Spain (411,000).</p> <p>The Home Office study found that most emigrants intend to live abroad for more than four years and most go to work in a definite job. It said that unemployment and changes in the value of the pound appear to be key factors. But it added, that emigration may now be something that people have to save up for and aspire to and is no longer a desperate throw the dice by the unemployed.</p> <p>The research found that British emigration to Australia declined after 2006 as British unemployment rates increased. \"Put another way, in a time of unemployment individuals' first priority may be to secure some employment at home, and only then when receiving an income will they be able to plan and resource a move abroad,\" it said.</p>",
  "<p>France's president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, sought to shrug off his business-bashing reputation on Tuesday with a \u20ac20bn-a-year (\u00a316bn) package of tax credits and other pro-industry measures.</p> <p>The prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, surprised many by announcing that the government would accept much of the recommendations of a report by Louis Gallois, the former EADS boss, on making the French economy more competitive.</p> <p>\"France is not condemned to the spiral of decline. But we need a jolt at a national level to regain control of our destiny,\" Ayrault said. \"This is about giving our companies room to manoeuvre.\"</p> <p>Firms will be offered tax credits worth up to \u20ac10bn next year, rising to \u20ac20bn by 2015, to be financed by an increase in VAT and \u20ac10bn in public spending cuts, as yet unspecified. That was less than the \u20ac30bn-a-year cut in payroll taxes that Gallois demanded, but far more than many analysts expected. The rebates will be proportionate to the size of a company's payroll, up to a maximum of two-and-a-half times the minimum wage, in an attempt to support jobs.</p> <p>Amid rising concern about France's global competitiveness, Hollande is keen to show that despite implementing a 75% top rate of income tax on the super-rich, he is on the side of business. Fabrice Montagne, of Barclays, said the announcement would \"improve sentiment vis-a-vis the government's economic policy, which will be welcomed by the president as approval rates are at significantly low levels\".</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund said in its annual report on the French economy, published on Monday, that without radical reform France could slip behind Spain and Italy, which have been hobbled by lack of competitiveness against the mighty German economy.</p> <p>The government's proposals, which will have to be passed by parliament before it can be implemented, also include support for training and small business, and investment in innovation.</p>",
  "<p>The pace of growth in Britain's recession-scarred economy slowed sharply in the autumn, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research predicted on Tuesday, after official figures revealed a 1.7% drop in industrial output in September.</p> <p>The thinktank's latest forecast, published on Tuesday, showed GDP expanding by 0.5% in the three months to October \u2013 just half the speed of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/uk-emerges-from-double-dip-recession-george-osborne\" title=\"\">the 1% expansion in the three months to September that brought the double-dip recession to a close</a>. NIESR expects it to be 2014 before output returns to the levels seen before the credit crrunch.</p> <p>City analysts said the unexpectedly weak performance of industry, which makes up about 15% of the economy, made a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/06/retail-sales-triple-dip-recession\" title=\"\">\"triple-dip\"</a> \u2013 with the Olympics bounce giving way to a renewed recession \u2013 look increasingly likely.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said maintenance on North Sea oil platforms led to a 15.3% collapse in mining and quarrying output in September, contributing to the 1.7% fall in overall production. Manufacturing, which the government sees as key to reviving the economy, eked out a gain of just 0.1% on the month.</p> <p>\"UK factory output barely rose in September and energy production slumped, adding to evidence that the country risks sliding back into another downturn after the temporary growth surge enjoyed in the summer,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at data provider Markit.</p> <p>Bookmaker Paddy Power is offering odds of just 1-3 on GDP slipping back into the red in one of the next three quarters. A spokesman said: \"With the Olympics bounce now over and activity in the service sector tumbling, it's looking odds on the UK economy is, to use contemporary parliamentary parlance, toast.\"</p> <p>However, manufacturers' group the EEF was keen to point out that a number of industries, including pharmaceuticals, transport and electrical equipment all saw production rise over the month.</p> <p>\"A modest uptick in output in September points to some growth still out there for manufacturers, despite some of the weaker survey data recently,\" said the EEF's chief economist, Lee Hopley.</p> <p>She urged George Osborne to build on this cautious optimism by offering \"a clear vision from government at the autumn statement about the priorities for our economy and a plan to ensure growth stays on track\". When official figures released last month showed the recession drawing to a close in the third quarter of 2012, the chancellor was careful to give the news a guarded welcome, stressing that growth could weaken again in coming months.</p> <p>Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, said the worse-than-expected performance from industry might help tempt policymakers on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee to extend its quantitative easing (QE) programme at their monthly meeting on Thursday.</p> <p>\"Signs that the economy is still struggling markedly despite the third-quarter GDP rebound keeps the door wide open to the Bank of England enacting more QE,\" he said.</p> <p>So far, the Bank has pumped \u00a3375bn of electronically created money into the economy to try and offset the impact of the credit drought from crisis-hit banks, and the lack of demand from markets in the eurozone.</p>",
  "<p>This film is the point at which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/harvey-weinstein\" title=\"\">Harvey Weinstein</a>, exploitation-movie impresario extraordinaire, meets Harvey Weinstein, Democratic big-money donor and activist. On the one hand, Weinstein is working an old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindhouse\" title=\"\">grindhouse</a> promotional gambit: riding the publicity coattails of a more prestigious and expensive feature of similar theme or provenance \u2013 in this case Kathryn Bigelow's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149492/zero-dark-thirty\" title=\"\">Zero Dark Thirty</a> \u2013 and attempting to reach the screens before it, the better to dine, vampirishly, on a percentage of the profits. The Democratic activist in Weinstein, meanwhile, was surely horrified when Columbia delayed the Bigelow picture until after the presidential election, and was damned if his version wasn't going to make some sort of splash before that date.</p> <p>So here we are. Seal Team 6 could only rate as propaganda in a toxic, Fox News-driven political environment such as obtains at this moment. Forget all that context, however, and you find here a pretty niftily put together platoon-movie, tautly directed by John Stockwell (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/95084/blue.crush\" title=\"\">Blue Crush</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89406\" title=\"\">Crazy/Beautiful</a>), well cast with familiar second-string TV faces (Boss's Kathleen Robertson, Six Feet Under's Freddy Rodriguez et al, plus the gaunt and reliable William Fichtner). It provides a fairly clear, certainly a very exciting depiction of the raid as it went down, while bolstering the shoot-em-up material with fictionalised backstories for the Seals themselves (the real Team 6 will remain anonymous for life).</p> <p>The movie demonstrates that we now have a firm, widely agreed-upon visual aesthetic for the Iraq-Afghanistan campaign movies, one distinct from the emerald-green rice paddies and triple-canopy jungles of the Vietnam war film. Like everything from FX's short-lived Over There TV series to Bigelow's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/130570/hurt-locker\" title=\"\">The Hurt Locker</a>, Seal Team 6 flaunts a narrow palette of sandy, dusty landscapes, camouflage colouring, darkened briefing rooms and barracks, sun-baked Afghan ravines, teeming <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souq\" title=\"\">souks</a>. Much of this is seen through helmet-cams, night-vision goggles, spy-surveillance cameras and the baleful aerial gaze of satellites (the menacing thrum of chopper-blades remains a constant).</p> <p>For Seal Team 6, though, the dominant influence seems to be Showtime's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/homeland\" title=\"\">Homeland</a>, with Robertson playing the Carrie Mathieson role as Vivian Hollands, the determined analyst who makes the first smart guess about the house in Abbottabad and puts it under surveillance (\"one very tall bearded man, not busy \u2013 we call him 'the Pacer' \u2013 12-foot-high walls, 12-13 guards, no phone or internet, all trash burned on-site, all children home-schooled \u2026\"). The intelligence meetings feel very similar, the general hum of paranoia and secrecy too; indeed, one street pursuit scene closely \u2013 almost exactly \u2013 resembles the climax of Homeland season two, episode one (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smile\" title=\"\">The Smile</a>), but from the perspective of the hunters rather than the prey.</p> <p>No matter. Seal Team 6 motors along very compellingly with its well-drawn squad of surfer dudes, hot-headed redneck mama's boys and wise-counsel sergeants (the conventional platoon-movie stereotypes), and its good feel for procedure, training and tradecraft, peppered with to-camera testimony from the Seals. The raid itself occupies a nerve-wracking final 20 minutes of stun-grenades, gunfire and the desperate clearing of shooter-filled rooms illuminated only by flashlights.</p> <p>So is it revenge-porn too? Certainly the camera eats up the brains flying out of Bin Laden's turban [spoiler alert: he dies in the end] but mainly, like the US itself on the day it happened, the movie lingers on a tangible sense of closure, of long-unfinished business finally taken care of \u2013 of utter relief. If there is an element of exploitation, it may be in Weinstein's late addition of extra footage of Barack Obama \u2013 at the White House correspondents' dinner, and in the situation room \u2013 which to my mind looks analogous to a canny exploitation producer's decision to add more nudity to spice up his product. Old showbiz instincts die hard in a man like Weinstein, but sometimes good movies do result.</p> <p>\u2022 Seal Team 6 will be released in UK cinemas on 14 December, under the title Code Name: Geronimo</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 November. The surname of actor Kathleen Robertson was spelled inaccurately, and has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The former Conservative cabinet minister, Tim Yeo, has sharply criticised plans by senior ministers to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from aviation and shipping will not be included in the UK's carbon budgets.</p> <p>He warned that to leave out these major sources of emissions would contravene the 2008 Climate Change Act, which stipulates emissions cuts of 80% by 2050.</p> <p>Yeo said this could contribute to dangerous climate change, and that if these transport sectors were left out, other parts of the economy would have to make steeper cuts: \"If aviation and shipping emissions are now excluded, the overall target reduction for all other sectors would need to be increased from 80% to around 85%,\" he said.</p> <p>Yeo chairs the parliamentary select <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/ecc\" title=\"\">committee on energy and climate change</a>, which has written to ministers to urge them to include these major forms of transport in the UK's carbon budgets. A decision on whether to include them is expected later this year.</p> <p>George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer, is known to be reluctant to take any measure that could be construed as adding to consumers' bills. He wants to be seen as championing consumers by refusing regulation, and to appeal to the right wing of the Tory party, many of whom are sceptical of green issues. His supporters in government are also understood to have raised concerns with the Department of Transport and the Department of Business, Information and Skills.</p> <p>Emissions from aviation and shipping have been a heated issue in climate change debates. Aviation alone accounts for close to 3% of global emissions, but because it is difficult to apportion the emissions from international flights to one state or another, governments have tended simply to shelve the issue.</p> <p>The sectors were left out of the 1997 Kyoto protocol, because rows over how to include them could not be resolved. But this situation is untenable in the long term, argue climate experts, because as international travel and global trade are growing, emissions from the sectors are increasing.</p> <p>The European Union became the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/15/eu-airline-emissions-tax-success\" title=\"\">first to attempt to regulate emissions from aviation</a> this year, by including international flights in its emissions trading system. That means airlines must buy carbon permits to cover the emissions generated by all of their planes that take off or land in EU member states.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/23/european-airlines-emissions-trading-sanctions-threat\" title=\"\">Airlines protested</a> that this would add to the costs of flights and encourage carriers to avoid Europe. In practice, however, the inclusion adds very little to the cost of flights because the price of carbon permits is so low, at just a few euros per tonne.</p> <p>Some other countries are unhappy at the regulation. The European commission is embroiled in a dispute with the US and China over the inclusion of flights in the trading scheme. The US Congress has moved to legislate on the issue, in order to forbid US airlines from complying.</p> <p>In the UK, bringing aviation and shipping into the scope of the carbon budgets would mean that, in future, either emissions from these sectors would have to be brought down, or those of other sectors, such as energy or road transport, would have to be cut even more sharply than planned.</p> <p>But the Treasury is understood to be concerned that including aviation and shipping in the budgets would raise the price of airline tickets and the cost of goods imported by ship. Green campaigners believe that including the sectors would encourage them to become more efficient.</p> <p>Yeo said the sectors should be included in the UK's carbon budgets, which set out how much can be emitted over a set period of years. Not including them would ignore a major and growing source of emissions.</p> <p>He said: \"The aim of the Climate Change Act was to demonstrate British leadership in the international effort to avoid a global temperature rise of 2C, widely regarded as a dangerous potential tipping point for the climate. We must not lose sight of the fact that the ultimate cost of failing to keep temperature rises below 2C could be measured in floods, mass migration, economic disruption and chaos.\"</p>",
  "<p>Campaigners who have fought for more than a decade to reopen a rail line closed during the infamous Beeching cuts in the 1960s have had more welcome news: the \u00a3300m project <a href=\"http://www.bordersrailway.co.uk/\">to reinstate part of the Borders line</a> has been expanded, in a small but vital way. </p> <p>It has taken some cajoling and diligent digging into market demand, but Network Rail and Transport Scotland have agreed to cater for the niche but lucrative market in historic railway excursions. </p> <p>It has taken a tiny tweak of the scheme - the relatively low cost but crucial decision to extend the platforms at the Tweedbank terminus south of Galashiels \u2013 which will transform the line from a crucial but workaday commuter link to the central Borders into a major attraction for rail enthusiasts. </p> <p>Now ScotRail, or whoever runs the franchise from 2015, when this new line is due to open, will have to work around the core train timetable, but this single decision unlocks a segment of the travel trade with worldwide appeal. </p> <p>They're already sketching out the sales pitch and writing the brochures for the global ex-patriot tourism market: <a href=\"http://www.bordersrailway.co.uk/\">the 35 mile line</a> is reinstating a healthy chunk of what used to be known as the Waverley line which until January 1969 ran to Carlisle, and it gives Borders tourism agencies the chance to market one of Scotland's literary giants, Sir Walter Scott.</p> <p>The line runs from Waverley station in central Edinburgh, a station named after Scott's eponymous epic and which sits just beside the rocket-like Scott monument on Princes Street; it will now terminate at Tweedbank, a mile or so walk from Scott's <a href=\"http://www.scottsabbotsford.co.uk/\">grand manorial home at Abbotsford</a> \u2013 his newly refurbished \"conundrum castle\".</p> <p>So cue Waverley-themed excursions to the Borders, conducted by men with mutton chops, top hats and breeches. It seems obvious. </p> <p>Apparently it took intense lobbying, and detailed market surveys by the Campaign for Borders Rail and the Waverley Route Trust to persuade the transport agencies to embrace the idea. They gave a nod of thanks to Keith Brown, the Scottish transport minister, who signed over the \u00a3294m contract to build the line to Network Rail on Tuesday.</p> <p>As part of that agreement, Network Rail has extended the platforms at Tweedbank specially to cater for trains of up to 12 coaches long with historic engines at both ends, campaigners envisage 'classic' rolling stock with large picture windows hauled by diesel or steam locomotives hauling up to 500 passengers on day or weekend-long excursions from across Britain.</p> <p>David Spaven, a key figure in the Borders rail campaign, and author of a new history of the line, <a href=\"http://www.argyllpublishing.co.uk/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=124&amp;Itemid=3&amp;vmcchk=1&amp;Itemid=3 \">Waverley Route: the life, death and rebirth of the Borders Railway</a>, said there were over 80 charter trains to Scottish destinations in 2009 - excluding football and rugby specials and the Royal Scotsman luxury land cruise.</p> <blockquote> <p>The single most popular destination was Edinburgh, and two thirds of the charters came from English towns and cities, bringing entirely new spend to the destination locations. </p> <p>The CBR/WRT research concluded \u2013 conservatively \u2013 that around \u00a3500,000 of extra income could be flow into the Borders economy every year with charter train traffic and the Royal Scotsman. </p> <p>The local economic benefits of special trains are particularly well understood in Fort William and Mallaig, where the steam-hauled Jacobite has been an outstanding success.</p> </blockquote> <p>The new line will include 10 stations reconnecting the Borders town of Galashiels with Edinburgh \u2013 with seven new ones built south of Edinburgh, along 30 miles of new track in what will be the longest reinstatement of a line closed in the Beeching era.</p> <p>Those stations include one not originally planned in the first scheme, a station at Stow north of Galashiels where one of only two of the original Victorian era station-master's houses still sits at the trackside. That too was reinstated after a vigorous campaign by locals.</p> <p>Catherine Maxwell Stuart, chairwoman of Scottish Borders Tourism Partnership, agreed with Spaven about the decision to cater for charter trains:</p> <blockquote> <p>The tourism industry in the Borders stands to gain enormously from the re-opening of the Borders Railway. The sector is already planning for the coming of the railway to ensure we can maximise the benefits for tourists and visitors to the Borders and continue to grow a sustainable tourism sector.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>So for some enthusiasts, this conjures up evocative images of classic diesel locomotives, hauling carefully restored Pullman-type carriages, steadily climbing through the Moorfoots past <a href=\" http://www.borthwickcastle.com/\">the 600 year old tower of Borthwick castle</a>. Mary Queen of Scots slept there. For others of a more pragmatic mind, this could help build the case for extending the line again, to Hawick just to the south, and eventually onto Carlisle \u2013 again.</p>",

Imagine what Jon Stewart could have done about the issue of Scottish independence or Saturday Night Live could have done about the \"cash for access\" scandal or what Trey Parker and Matt Stone could have done with the Jimmy Savile story.\" </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19193358\" title=\"\">JeremyinOz heartily agrees:</a></p> <blockquote> \"When people compare British comedy favourably with American comedy (something that is getting harder and harder to do) they forget about the cartoon: South Park; the Family Guy stable and Matt Groening's work, which are consistently better and more biting than anything on British TV. When British writers try to be as pointed as South Park, say, they tend to come across as whiny or bitter or think that shouting Tory loudly is funny.\" </blockquote> <p>Speaking of whiny, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/30/sarah-millican\" title=\"\">Sarah Millican's responses to the laser-like questioning of Guardian interviewer Simon Hattenstone</a> drew some criticism \u2013 and defence \u2013 from our readers. Then came <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19194068\" title=\"\">jingjangjong, placing Millican firmly in the context of a grim view of UK comedy</a>.</p> <blockquote> \"She is no better or no worse than a raft of about 20 or so well-remunerated comics who seem to slip effortlessly from primetime BBC One to stadium tour to mega-selling DVD. They are all beige, boring and safe. It is like the past 30 years of alternative comedy never happened. <br> \"Actually things are probably worse now [than at the time of] the supposed wasteland of pre-alternative comedy in the 70s. At least Bernard Manning and his ilk doing jokes about \"them Pakis up our street\" was balanced out by Les Dawson and Dave Allen (on primetime ITV, no less!) doing stuff that made you wonder at the beauty of the English language or think about important stuff like politics and religion. What do we have now in the way of standup on TV that makes you think? Stewart Lee buried on late-night BBC2 \u2026\" </blockquote> <p>Is anyone prepared to leap to the defence of UK comedy?</p>",
  "<h2>LAUGH ABOUT IT, SHOUT ABOUT IT, WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO CHOOSE. EVERY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT YOU LOSE...</h2> <p>Billions have been spent. Speeches made. Pledges. Promises. Excuses. And, after more hot air than a Zeppelin stuffed with scouts who've just had double sausage and beans for tea, the day of reckoning has arrived (although some insist that, whatever happens, it will change nothing). So who are you cheering on? The blue donkeys? Or the guys in red? Yes, it's bound to be close, but - if pushed - the Fiver just about expects Manchester City to squeeze past Ajax when they meet at Eastlands.</p> <p>Still, you have to be worried about the mood in the City camp. Not only do they go into tonight's Big Cup clash with one point from three games, but Roberto Mancini has been getting out his Motown classics and demanding some R-E-S-P-E-C-T. \"I don't understand why you continue to ask me about last month, last year,\" he told assorted hacks when asked about his summer flirt with Monaco, giving them the sort of daggers you usually only see in Moss Side <em>[Didn't we cover this breaking 26-hour-old news yesterday? - Fiver Ed]</em>. \"We have won three trophies. I think you should have more respect for this, for me, for the club, for the players.\"</p> <p>City know that even a win tonight, and victories against Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund in what the Fiver is contractually obliged to call 'matchday five' and 'matchday six', might not be enough. And that a spot in Euro Vase, a competition that's about as <a href=\"http://www.deathlist.net/\" title=\"\">inviting as the 2012 deathlist</a> awaits. And they might be yet be joined by Arsenal, who need something from their visit to Schalke tonight to keep Olympiacos from moving menacingly alongside them.</p> <p>Still, the good news for Arsenal fans is that while Aaron Ramsey picked up groin-aww-achh-ARRRGH-YAROOOOO against United, thus joining Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Gervinho, Tomas Rosicky and Abou Diaby in the physio's booth, Andre Santos will be kept as far away from the first XI tonight as he was from Antonio Valencia on Saturday. \"I'd like to apologise to supporters who felt aggrieved by [the shirt swap with Robin van Persie],\" Santos told the SuperSoarawaySun. \"Did I think it would cause such a commotion? Of course I didn't, otherwise I would have told Robin to exchange the shirts away from public view.\" A comment that suggests the Brazilian is as endearingly haphazard off the pitch as on. Much like the team he plays for, you could argue.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"I think the boss deserves to be mingling with the top managers week-in week-out.

  "<p>The disease threatening to devastate the UK's 80 million ash trees appears to have spread even further than government estimates, and is now feared to be present in four new counties.</p> <p>Worcestershire, Surrey, Greater London and East Sussex all now appear to have trees afflicted by the disease, according to the <a href=\"http://ashtag.org/\" title=\"\">AshTag</a> mapping exercise led by a team at the University of East Anglia.</p> <p>Photos of cases submitted via <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/29/ashtag-app-tree-disease-dieback\" title=\"\">a smartphone app</a> and verified by an expert on the fungus that causes ash dieback, <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, indicate likely sightings in places where the official mapping project by the Forestry Commission has yet to confirm the disease.</p> <p>On Monday, the government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/05/ash-dieback-kent-essex\" title=\"\">confirmed infected cases had been found in the Kent and Essex countryside</a>, the first in the \"wild\" beyond Norfolk and Suffolk. On Tuesday, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-20218519\" title=\"\">the disease was found at a nursery near Rugby, Warwickshire</a>, following tests by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p> <p>The cases identified by the <a href=\"http://ashtag.org/\" title=\"\">AshTag</a> project, which has been soliciting sightings by the public via an Apple and Android smartphone apps, add to the counties, which range from Renfrewshire to Berkshire, where it has been found in recent plantings.</p> <p>Iben Margrete Thomsen, a Danish expert on the fungus, who verified the sightings, said: \"The AshTag app is a useful tool for mapping the spread of the disease, as the results are beginning to show. Now that it's autumn, people should look for the characteristic lesions or dieback, rather than for leaf symptoms which are not that distinctive anyway.\"</p> <p>The new sightings have yet to be officially confirmed by laboratory or field tests. But they lend weight to fears from leading scientists that the fungus \u2013 which is borne by the wind and can quickly kill younger trees \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/02/ash-tree-disease-10-years\" title=\"\">could spread as quickly as 20 miles a year</a>, putting at risk the vast majority of the UK's ash trees.</p> <p>However one expert said the genetic lineage of the most of the country's ash trees might provide hopes of avoiding a repeat of Dutch elm disease, which wiped out most of the UK's mature elms by the 1990s.</p> <p>Graham Rowe, a senior lecturer in molecular ecology at the University of Derby, said that because most of the country's ash was descended from trees from south-west Europe, they might have some resistance to the disease. In Denmark, where ash dieback wiped out 90% of trees, the ash originated in south-east Europe. \"It looks like the [UK's trees] are of a distinct genetic stock. Therefore they might show a level of resistance,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Rowe added that the official confirmed cases of ash dieback had so far been found in the east of the country, and the populations of those ash trees looked to be descended from the same genetic line as those that have been affected by the disease in Denmark.</p> <p>However, he warned that those UK ash trees which likely came thousands of years ago from modern-day Spain and Portugal could potentially be even more likely to succumb to the fungus. \"There is a possibility that they are even more vulnerable,\" he said. \"It could go either way, though there is no reason to suspect that it would be negative.\"</p> <p>The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, has convened a summit to address the ash dieback crisis on Wednesday.</p> <p>On Tuesday, he said at a parliamentary hearing: \"It is known that the fungus exists on leaves but there is no known cure except to destroy and burn trees.\" Asked if any trees were resistant and it was really necessary to burn trees, he said: \"Over 100,000 trees have been destroyed recently but there is a chance we could develop strain of ash that can be protected.\"</p> <p>Paterson said that research should be completed by Wednesday morning which will give a clearer idea of whether the disease has been spread from the air or live saplings from the continent where the disease was first found at a Buckinghamshire nursery in February, and confirmed in March.

  "<p>A survey of<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network\"> Guardian Small Business Network</a> readers has revealed SMEs are faring well despite a backdrop of economic uncertainty.</p> <p>Although more than half of respondents feel unstable economic conditions are a continuing challenge small businesses are having to contend with, the majority have seen their company grow in the past 12 months. Only 16% of those polled say their business has declined over this period.</p> <p>While around a third of Small Business Network readers agreed another challenge SMEs face is an uncertain future, entrepreneurs still appear to be optimistic about the continued success of their companies. More than 90% say they expect to be running their business in five years.</p> <p>But when it comes to the impact certain external factors are having on small businesses, well, it's a less positive picture. Business owners and those who work for them feel government input into the SME sector is lacking. A mere 9% of respondents agreed that the government has a clear plan for UK enterprises, and that they are feeling the benefits of it.</p> <p>The Games also appear to have failed to have made an impact on many readers. Half of those polled disagreed with this statement: \"The Olympics and Paralympics were a fantastic opportunity for UK SMEs to raise profile and revenue\".</p> <p>Staying on the theme of the wider business environment, we also asked those who answered the survey if they agreed Britain pulling further out of the EU would be bad for UK SMEs - over half did (53%).</p> <p>But when it comes to how individual firms are getting on, there were some encouraging signs that despite these straitened times lots of small businesses are predicting growth.</p> <p>There is confidence around business performance - two-thirds of those polled estimated their turnover will be significantly greater in three year's time. Expansion also appears to be on the agenda for small businesses, with 41% of those polled planning to recruit more staff in the next year.</p> <p>What is particularly interesting is the methods small businesses are using to recruit. Word- of-mouth and recommendations emerged as the most popular methods of finding new staff. Employers explained that they utilise \"my own network\" and \"people I know and trust\" to find the right staff for their business.</p> <p>Still, despite the positive results emerging from the survey, there are numerous challenges which are impacting those running or working for a small business. One respondent told us they faced \"a collapse of demand from public sector clients\", while another was struggling with \"a lack of salesmanship experience\".</p> <p>For some participants it was the sheer volume of work that comes with running a small business that they find tough. There's \"not enough time\", say one respondent, while another admitted it's hard \"doing everything that needs to be done.\"</p> <p><em>Alison White is editor of the Guardian Small Business Network. </em></p> <p><em>More than 600 people responded to our survey and the insight they shared will be used to inform the live Q&amp;As and advice blogs we feature on the site.

  "<p>A sweeping redesign of the government's seven biggest websites aims to save \u00a31.2bn over the next three years \u2013 and further improvements to other department sites used for interaction with the public will save a further \u00a31.7bn annually from 2015, according to Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude.</p> <p>Making the billion annual transactions between government, citizens and businesses \"digital by default\" will see accelerated savings, as more driving test bookings, tax payments and other government-related transactions go online, Maude said.</p> <p>Unveiling a sweeping new digital strategy to get those everyday transactions with government online, Maude said that \u00a31.2bn could be saved in the next three years \u2013 and that the pace of saving would accelerate over time.</p> <p>\"Digital services are much more convenient because they can be accessed whenever you want them,\" said Maude. \"They are also much more efficient, saving taxpayers' money and the user's time. Online transactions can be 20 times cheaper than by phone, 30 times cheaper than face-to-face, and up to 50 times cheaper than by post.\"</p> <p>Seven of the busiest government departments, including the Inland Revenue and Department of Work and Pensions, will be obliged to overhaul their websites to ensure that they offer the best possible experience for people who want to use them to access services.</p> <p>The government presently handles more than a billion transactions per year with citizens across 650 services \u2013 though those seven departments account for more than 90% of central government transactions. Those are the Inland Revenue, Department for Transport, Department of Work and Pensions, Department of Business, Information and Skills, Department of Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs, Ministry of Justice and the Home Office.</p> <p>All will be in the front line for active redesign to make them \"digital by default\" \u2013 even as other websites are shut down. In the past year the government has closed 74 \"redundant\" sites as it slimlines its web presence to focus on its remodelled gov.uk portal.</p> <p>But the drive to make such services digital could put many lower-paid groups who do not have internet access at a disadvantage. Current figures show that <a href=\"http://94.236.18.105/digital/research/#fig-1\" title=\"\">18% of adults \"never or rarely\"</a> use the internet \u2013 although 77% of UK adults use the internet at least once a day. The data also show that 12% of adults are \"offline and unwilling to get online\".</p> <p>Maude said however that the changes were essential. Despite handling more than a billion transactions every year many of the 650 government services have no digital option \u2013 and the ones that are available need redesigns.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office also pointed to figures showing that in 2011 about 150m phone calls made to government services could have been avoided if the online service were better.</p> <p>The redesign will start with the seven Whitehall departments that handle the majority of central government transactions, and target the services which cope with more than 100,000 transactions annually for digital transformation.</p> <p>Any new or redesigned service introduced after April 2014 will also have to meet a new Digital by Default standard.</p> <p>Mike Bracken, executive director of the Government Digital Service, which last month produced the remodelled gov.uk site, said the strategy was \"a truly digital document which reflects our ambitions and signals a clear roadmap for working with departments to help them achieve the goals set out in this strategy\".</p> <p>The gov.uk site will become the central hub for corporate publication by all 24 central government departments by March 2013, and other agencies and \"arm's length\" bodies will follow by March 2014.</p> <p>The redesigned gov.uk \u2013 which took over from the Directgov site \u2013 has won plaudits in user testing for its ease of use, and the speed with which people could find the information they wanted, taking 80 seconds compared with 120 on Directgov, which it replaced.</p>",
  "<p>A territorial dispute between Japan and China over a group of uninhabited islands is wreaking havoc with Japanese car makers while benefiting German competitors, as Nissan was forced to slash its profit forecast and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/06/bmw-sales-record-china\" title=\"\">BMW posted a 40% surge in Chinese sales</a>.</p> <p>Nissan joined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/09/japanese-car-sales-china-islands-dispute\" title=\"\">Honda and Toyota in suffering plummeting demand</a> in the world's largest car market due to a boycott by consumers angry about Japanese ownership of the the Senkaku Islands, which are known as Diaoyu in China. Nissan cut its full-year net profit forecast by a fifth to $4bn (\u00a32.5bn), reflecting its dependence on a market that accounts for more than a quarter of sales. The scale of the boycott was revealed by October sales figures, which showed that Nissan and its Chinese joint venture sold 64,300 vehicles \u2013 a decline of 41% on the same month last year. Toyota and Honda reported Chinese sales slumps of 49% and 41% respectively in September.</p> <p>As well as cutting its full-year profit forecast, Nissan trimmed annual sales forecasts as it estimated that sales in China will come in at 1.175m vehicles in 2012, 175,000 fewer than it thought previously. That helped to put a dent in global forecasts, with Nissan predicting sales of 5.08m vehicles in the year to March 2013, down from its former forecast of 5.35m. Nissan said, however, that there had been signs of a revival in China.</p> <p>\"We are gradually seeing signs of recovery [in China],\" said Nissan's chief operating officer, Toshiyuki Shiga. \"Customers are gradually coming back to dealerships.\"</p> <p>Germany's BMW said ongoing Chinese demand for luxury vehicles \u2013 also a boon for UK carmakers such as Bentley \u2013 helped to overcome a weak European performance in the third quarter from July to September. Overall sales rose by 13.7% to a record \u20ac18.8bn (\u00a315bn), while net profit rose 16% to \u20ac1.3bn. Chinese sales rose by 40% to nearly 80,000 units, overshadowing an anaemic European performance that saw a 2.6% increase in sales, with southern Europe dragging down performance. Even BMW's home market disappointed, as German sales fell by 0.5%.</p> <p>Mark Fulthorpe, analyst at IHS Automotive, said non-Japanese car makers were benefiting from the Senkaku dispute. \"Who is likely to win if people are walking away from Nissan, Toyota and Honda? It will have significant benefits for German manufacturers and [Korean car makers] Hyundai and Kia.\"</p> <p>China aside, BMW warned of an \"increasingly uncertain market environment\" with the final three months of the year posing difficulties for an industry \"likely to be confronted with adverse business conditions\". With the eurozone area expected to post flat economic growth next year, hopes of a concerted revival in the European car market are slim. In September, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/16/european-car-sales-fall-new-car-registrations\" title=\"\">European car sales fell for the 12th consecutive month</a>, with Spain posting a 36.8% fall in sales, exceeded only by Greece, with a fall of 48.5%.</p> <p>UK car sales in October, published on Tuesday, showed that the domestic market was outperforming the continent. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said new car registrations rose 12% compared with October last year to more than 151,000 units. So far this year, the UK car market has grown 5%. The top three sellers in October were the Ford Fiesta, followed by the Vauxhall Corsa in second place and the Ford Focus.</p> <p>However, a manufacturing expert at Deloitte, David Raistrick, said car makers were preregistering cars - a practice that can flatter monthly sales figures - and 2013 is likely to be a tougher year for the UK market. \"Can the UK defy gravity? The answer is no. Manufacturers are helping support sales,\" said Raistrick.</p>",
  "<p>More than 100 Nigerians have been charged with treason after a protest march calling for an independent state of Biafra.</p> <p>Supporters of the Biafran Zionist Movement were arrested after an independence rally in the regional capital, Enugu. The protesters included many elderly war veterans from the bloody 1967 conflict in which Biafra tried to break away from the newly independent Nigeria.</p> <p>Supporters of the movement say there are growing calls for the region \u2013 dominated by the Igbo ethnic group \u2013 to break away from Nigeria.</p> <p>\"We don't want to be part of Nigeria because Nigeria is not working as a nation. These arrests just confirm the reasons why we want self-determination \u2013 this is a state where they can arrest us even though we have not committed any offence,\" said Chilos Godsent, from the Imo Mass Movement, which has called for the prosecution of former Nigerian heads of state for their role in the Biafra war.</p> <p>\"The policy and leadership of this country has done everything to exterminate and dehumanise the Biafran people. It is only through an independent nation that our capacity can truly be developed. Within that context we feel like we have the right to self-determination.\"</p> <p>\"The Nigerian leadership is corrupt \u2013 this is not the ethics of the Biafran people,\" Godsent added. \"We are gathering support from our people \u2013 we know that if we held a referendum today, 98% of the people in Biafra would support independence. This is a struggle that has lasted over 40 years.\"</p> <p>The protesters are evidence of a hardcore of separatists in the region, who still campaign for independence 40 years after the end of the Biafran conflict. The war, which began in 1967, was the bloodiest event in Nigeria's post-colonial history, and began when the oil-rich south-eastern region \u2013 dominated by the Igbo ethnic group \u2013 seceded as the Republic of Biafra.</p> <p>Blockades and flighting between Biafran forces and the Nigerian army led to the deaths of more than one million people, mostly from hunger and disease. The Biafran government surrendered in 1970, ending hopes of an independent republic, but separatist sentiments have remained alive among some in the region.</p> <p>There has been increasing international interest in the movement recently. Last month renowned Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe wrote in the Guardian that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/chinua-achebe-biafra-review\" title=\"\">persecution of Igbos still persists</a> in Nigeria, as the legacy of the conflict continues to haunt the nation. His recently published <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/05/chinua-achebe-there-was-a-country-review\" title=\"\">memoirs</a> have aroused renewed debate about the conflict.</p> <p>The award-winning novel Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is set to bring the events of the Biafra war to a global audience: a film based on the book, which chronicles the lives of a family who live through the war, is set for release in 2013.</p> <p>\"Across the board in Nigeria there is a deepening sense of disaffection with the idea of Nigeria, [it] has really failed to become a meaningful political community. And so what you see is a reflection of that sense of profound disappointment,\" said Nigerian writer Okey Ndibe in a <a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/1042257-biafra-protests-in-nigeria-reflect-sense-of-disaffection-says-writer-okey-ndibe-interview#t=2m11s\" title=\"\">radio interview</a>.</p> <p>\"The issues of injustice that caused that war have not been addressed\u2026 Violence has become the ruling ethic in Nigeria. Violence is produced by the state, and now you have Boko Haram and other extremists and fundamentalists groups in the country,\" Ndibe said. \"I expect that there will be more of this kind of protest in the Igbo-speaking areas that we know as Biafra, but also in the other parts of Nigeria.\"</p> <p>A #Biafra hashtag began trending on Twitter after the arrests, with one commentator writing, \"#Biafra arrests wont stop the sun from rising. Nigeria needs to go back to honesty, peace, justice, equity, fair play, without this its a matter of time\".</p> <p>Another wrote: \"In my opinion, I blame Chinua Achebe for toothless veterans and loyalists of Biafra charged with treason\".</p>",
  "<p>That we face serious problems \u2013 poverty amid plenty, the degradation of our physical, social, and economic environments, terrorism by fanatic cells and rogue states, and so on \u2013 is clear. But how our established institutions \u2013 governments and businesses \u2013 deal with them, even when responsive and responsible, is not. We need another way.</p> <h2>Don't expect miracles from CSR</h2> <p>I applaud honest corporate social responsibility. But it's fanciful to believe that the problems created by some corporations will be resolved by other corporations. Green retailing, for example, will not compensate for greedy drilling. CSR may be a popular mantra these days, but no less necessary is HCR (Holding Corporations \u2013 and corporate executives \u2013 Responsible) for their own corporate social irresponsibility.</p> <p>Likewise, let's applaud companies that do well by doing good: installing wind turbines, supplying organic foods, and the like. But let's not pretend that this will sweep across the corporate landscape creating a wonderland where everybody wins. Such claims cannot deflect our attention from the many companies that are doing well by doing bad.</p> <h2>We shouldn't wait for governments either</h2> <p>And what about governments? The great ones of the world got together in Copenhagen in 2009 to address global warming. Their accomplishment, according to one British minister for energy and climate change , was to put numbers on the table.</p> <p>In Durban two years later, the participating nations agreed to begin a long-term process of negotiating a new treaty. Their 2012 meeting in Rio was claimed to have produced a \"historic agreement\" because it was \"the start of discussion on sustainable development.\"</p> <p>These governments certainly got the message from their energy companies; it is the message of global warming that has yet to get through.</p> <p>Governments today are increasingly paralysed, because we no longer live in balanced societies. After the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, the West concluded that capitalism had triumphed.<strong> </strong>Not at all \u2013 it was balance that had triumphed.</p> <p>While those eastern countries were dominated by their public sectors, western ones were more balanced across their different sectors. But many countries around the world are now out of balance, in favour of their private sectors, as seen in the US, the UK and more surprisingly perhaps, in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/science/earth/canada-leaving-kyoto-protocol-on-climate-change.html\" title=\"\">Canada with its neo-conservative government</a>.</p> <p>The consequence is that these governments have become either co-opted or overwhelmed by their free enterprises. And on the global level, international agencies that should be regulating the large corporations, the IMF and the World Bank for example, have instead been acting as cheerleaders.</p> <h2>Community initiatives in the 'plural sector'</h2> <p>So how can we deal with our major problems? The answer to that question is simple: you, me, and us. As soon as we understand that our established institutions will not be the ones taking the lead, it becomes evident that we shall have to do so, individually and co-operatively.</p> <p>If you want to find out who is responsible for global warming, and many of the other social problems, take a look in the mirror. Think of this each time you drop your convenient externalities (garbage) down some chute. It may costs you next to nothing, but it may be costing our planet everything.</p> <p>Each of us will have to change what we do individually. But more importantly, all of us will have to change how we function socially.</p> <p>For too many years we have been stuck in the political battle between left and right: governments versus markets, communism versus capitalism, nationalisation and privatisation, Karl Marx versus Adam Smith.</p> <p>There is also a sector beyond the public and the private that has a critical role to play, not only in rebalancing societies, but also in taking a lead in addressing our most serious problems. Some people call it civil society but I prefer to term it the plural sector, which makes clear that it comprises a wide range activities that are neither private nor public. Included in this are member-owned organisations (co-ops, churches, etc) and organisations owned by no-one (Greenpeace, hospitals as trusts, etc), as well as social movements and social initiatives.</p> <p>Social movements raise awareness about problems and confront the perpetrators. But it is social initiatives that create solutions, largely by circumventing these perpetrators.</p> <p>We all know some of these initiatives, local and beyond: for example a municipal food bank, the micro-financing that has extended from Bangladesh or the use of ethanol fuel in Brazil. But how many of us realise that vast numbers of these exist, all around the world. They begin indigenously, through the efforts of people who bond together in local communities, and can now spread quickly across communities thanks to social media.</p> <p>These initiatives are changing the world, but not as fast as our problems are damaging it. And that is where you and I and we come in. When we stop pretending that governments and businesses will resolve all of our problems, we will realise the need to involve ourselves in such initiatives. And when many of us do that, governments and businesses will get the message. Then PPPPs \u2013 public, private, plural partnerships \u2013 can form to drive the massive reforms that have become so necessary.</p> <p><a href=\"http://people.mcgill.ca/henry.mintzberg/\" title=\"\"><em>Henry Mintzberg</em></a><em> is Cleghorn professor of management studies at the </em><a href=\"http://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/\" title=\"\"><em>Desautels Faculty of Management at McGill University</em></a><em>.

  "<p>You may recall that the end of May saw an unusual flurry of activity in the UK. The commencement of enforcement of the ePrivacy legislation saw a lot done, and even more written, about complying with the slightly nebulous requirement to obtain consent from users before depositing cookies on their system when they visit your website.</p> <p>The need to assess what cookies any given website actually dropped led to a general spring clean and wholesale removal of many tracking pixels. And then, at the last minute, the ICO declared that assumed consent would be fine, so, provided that sites reasonably informed users about the practice, they need not concern themselves with getting a user's explicit consent.</p> <p>Cue a collective sigh of relief from the industry as a whole, a springing up of lots of little boxes on websites saying, \"We use cookies, please be aware\" and everyone going back to business as usual, albeit with greater awareness of how cookies work and with a generally tidier internet.</p> <p>This situation has persisted largely untroubled for the past five months in the UK. While it has been recently reported that the ICO may start \"getting serious\" about imposing large penalties on non-compliers, this is mere speculation. The ICO themselves have remained silent on the matter.</p> <p>But how come the ICO aren't making more of a fuss? It is largely because the debate has moved on \u2013 the irons in the fire that are of much greater consequence are Do Not Track and the EU Data Protection legislation.</p> <p>Do Not Track is at base a sensible approach to provide a way users can indicate their privacy preferences to websites <em>without</em> using cookies, which are clunky to manage, get deleted and used for heaps of other things, too. However, it's dispiriting that fundamental questions \u2013 \"What does 'Track' mean?\", \"What should websites do if it's set to 'on'?\" and \"What if the user wants some websites to track them but not others?\" \u2013 are yet to be resolved, more than two years after the standard was first mooted.</p> <p>Microsoft's stance to enable it by default in IE10, hence torpedoing it as an indicator of user consent, has further muddied the water. Neelie Kroes has recently voiced her disapproval of the chaos gathering around DNT, while not mentioning at all the fact the ePrivacy directive that is actually law is being all but ignored. Saving Do Not Track is deemed far more worthy of attention than arguing about a law that was only ever going to be a stopgap measure.</p> <p>The EU Data Protection change is even more far-reaching and significant. It goes way beyond internet cookies and advertising, but does codify a couple of things that affect online advertisers; Recital 24 blithely introduces the concept of \"online identifiers\", which could potentially be considered personally identifiable information, while article 4, part 8 rehashes the definition of \"consent\". As the new legislation is a regulation (law as written by EU) rather than a directive (law once you've made a local version), this will definitely result in further heartache.</p> <p>It is also revealing to look at the European countries that enabled the legislation before the UK. Not a single penalty has been imposed due to not obtaining consent for cookies, and a quick review of some major Spanish and French sites indicates a general lack of mechanisms in place to obtain even the assumed consent that has gained currency in the UK. The CNIL in France clearly don't view this as an issue worth wasting their time on \u2013 and, God knows, they are happy to pick fights with anyone if they feel one is justified.</p> <p>So, the powers that be have ultimately all but admitted that the law is bad and not worth enforcing.</p> <p>It had enough weight to cudgel the industry into tidying things up a bit and has served its purpose \u2013 we should now be ready to take on the more grown-up challenges of Do Not Track and Data Protection legislation updates. It may have taken us all more than two years to get to where we are, but that was only a first step, I'm afraid.</p> <p>What's the outlook? This was never going to be a situation with a nice neat end point. Industry players need to do the right thing by consumers but equally engage with trade bodies and their customers to ensure the correct balance between users' needs (right to privacy/anonymity) versus users' desires (free, user-friendly online services) is reflected in best practice and ultimately the law.</p> <p><em>Tim Sleath is business manager, global data and targeting, at </em><a href=\"http://www.exponential.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Exponential</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Laos has long been seen as a poor, landlocked, sparsely populated country. But it is at last emerging from its isolation. Once a part of French Indochina, ranking as the poor relation among its neighbours, it is now shaping up as a new contender in south-east Asia, with growth slated to exceed 8% this year, the highest in the region. This week the capital, Vientiane, hosted the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia%E2%80%93Europe_Meeting\" title=\"\">Asia-Europe Meeting (Asem)</a>, attracting sudden international attention to this small nation of 6.5 million.</p> <p>So what is driving the Lao economy? A one-party socialist republic since the revolution in 1975, it has taken the same course as its two much larger neighbours, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china\" title=\"\">China</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/vietnam\" title=\"\">Vietnam</a>, opening its market to the outside world but under strict government control.</p> <p>At the ninth congress of the Lao People's Revolutionary party (LPRP) in March 2011, the president, Choummaly Sayasone, spelled out the country's priorities: sustained growth of 8%, poverty reduction and improved education. These promises accompany the determination for economic reform, including floating publicly owned companies on the stock market.</p> <p>Given its initial handicap, the figures have been fairly encouraging. Per capita GDP in the Lao People's Democratic Republic has risen from $300 in 2001 to $1,200 in 2011. The government aims to achieve average annual income of $1,700 over the next three years. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/worldbank\" title=\"\">World Bank</a> now ranks Laos among \"low middle-income\" countries, and it might achieve \"upper middle-income\" status by 2020. It is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/10499134\" title=\"\">due to join the World Trade Organisation</a> at the end of the year.</p> <p>The reasons behind this turnaround are clear. In addition to the travel trade, Laos has capitalised on its substantial mining, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/forests\" title=\"\">forestry</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/hydropower\" title=\"\">hydro resources</a>. The Nam Theun 2 dam, built by France's EDF, may account for as much as 8% of state revenue next year.</p> <p>However, last year another hydroelectric scheme, on the Mekong, had to be shelved due to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/apr/18/mekong-hydropower-xayaburi-laos\" title=\"\">hostility of countries downstream</a>, concerned about the environmental impact.</p> <p>On the political front, Laos has been run by the LPRP ever since the Pathet Lao took control in 1975. Power is concentrated in the central committee, itself capped by the 11-member politburo. The government and the prime minister, Thongsing Thammavong, are tasked with implementing the decisions of the party. The main role of parliament, with its 132 deputies, is to rubber-stamp decisions taken upstream, but recently there have been signs of greater freedom of expression and more open criticism, particularly regarding corruption and poor management of public funds.</p> <p>Laos started experimenting with free-market economics in 1986, at the same time as the \"renewal\" policies decided by its \"big brother\" in neighbouring Vietnam. The system has evolved along similar lines to China, with no freedom of speech, zero tolerance for dissidents, and growing wealth among the party elite and military. The inherent shortcomings of such a system encourage clientelism and corruption, both of which hold back sustainable, more egalitarian development. The inadequate schools and health service exacerbate skills shortages in a country where more than a quarter of the population is illiterate.</p> <p>Why are China and Vietnam so interested in Laos? It seems that China has been its top foreign investor since 2010. Large areas of state-owned land have been allocated to Chinese firms, which have invested in rubber plantations and other forestry schemes, particularly in the north, now very much under Chinese influence.

While it may be true that much of what the public believes was a stable financial system has crashed, international banking cartels and transnational corporations have hardly disintegrated.</p> <p>If anything, the transfer of public money into corporations deemed too big to fail has further demonstrated how successful the elites have been in protecting their power. Indeed, many of the world's central banks are still printing money and receiving interest and influence at the expense of the millions of unemployed in recession-hit nations.</p> <p>In addition, the use of the war on terror to further indebt countries is working well. This is particularly true for the big protagonists. The US and the UK have huge military budgets, so the cost of these multiple wars are profits to an assortment of private military contractors and arms manufacturers, many being subsidiaries to some of the world's largest corporations.

With unemployment rising and civil unrest simmering unelected technocrats and economists take centre stage in decision-making. All this as central banks fight for their interest payments and the government assets that await privatisation.</p> <p>When the world faces such problems those behind the scenes consolidate wealth and shore up their dominant position; wars and economic restructuring are useful tools for this game. The elite and their New World Order are alive and kicking, working diligently towards greater profit and more control.

The Yanks are over here linguistically, and their turns of expression are already deeply embedded in English parlance. Why do we say \"in the doghouse\" when we keep our dogs in kennels? Why do we say \"married on a shoestring\" when we tie our shoes with laces, not with strings? Why do we say \"coming out of the closet\" when we keep things in cupboards?</p> <p>And then there are the rapid changes in pronunciation, when we tamely go over to the way Americans speak, rather than our own. Think of the \"arrilies\": \"primarily\" is a prime example. We used to say it with the stress on the first syllable, but now it's pry-<em>marry</em>-li, in the American way. The same goes for all the other arrilies, voluntarily, necessarily, temporarily etc. Nobody under the age of 60 pronounces these words in the good old-fashioned English way. Very harassing!</p> <p>But still, we must admit that they have contry-booted very much to our way of speaking, and distry-booted their terms of expression throughout the English-speaking world. Take these two sentences I heard from colleagues: \"He must have went.\" \"I used to could.\" Utter grammatical solecisms, one would say, but they were spoken by American teachers of English \u2013 showing they are quite willing to take liberties with grammatical rules for colourful effect.</p> <p>Who else would have come up with \"modem\" \"upload\" \"downsize\" and other such invaluable expressions?

  "<p>The UK's beaches were the dirtiest in a decade in 2012, with <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/water/waterquality/bathing/documents/bathing-waters-results-summary-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">two in five failing national standards for pollution</a>, figures released on Tuesday by the government show.</p> <p>The surge in sewage, farm and city waste being flushed into the sea is the result of very wet weather, according to the Environment Agency.</p> <p>\"It is shocking: the results are the worst in a decade,\" said Hugo Tagholm, executive director of <a href=\"http://www.sas.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Surfers Against Sewage</a>. \"The UK's overburdened sewerage system is bursting at the seams, resulting in all too frequent raw sewage and storm water discharges nationwide.\" Tagholm called the <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/water/water-quality/bathing/\" title=\"\">existing standards</a>, set in 1976, \"out of date\" and noted new tougher European rules on beach hygiene are due to come into force from 2015.</p> <p>Environment minister, Richard Benyon, said: \"While the majority of England's bathing waters continue to be of a good quality, I am disappointed that a number have fallen short of the tighter standard. Water companies are now planning their next round of investment and I am determined that improving bathing water quality should be a key focus of these plans.\"</p> <p>Lord Chris Smith, chairman of the Environment Agency, said: \"During intense rainfall, pollution from farmland, roads, and drains is washed into rivers and coastal areas. Water companies also operate 'combined sewage overflows' (CSOs) to prevent sewage from backing up and flooding people's homes. More needs to be done by water companies, businesses, farmers and local authorities to improve the water at Britain's beaches.\"</p> <p>Figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) show the number of beaches failing basic cleanliness standards more than doubled in 2012 to 35 compared to 2011, and included World Heritage Kimmeridge Bay in the south, Bude Summerleaze and Budleigh Salterton in the south-west and Saltburn in the north-east. Overall, the number of beaches failing the basic 1976 standard fell from 98% to 94%. The south-west suffered most, with 16 dirty beaches compared to just two in 2011.</p> <p>Tagholm said that even on beaches that pass the basic standard bathers can still be presented with a one in seven chance of contracting gastroenteritis.</p> <p>The beaches failing the higher guideline standard almost doubled to 247 and overall, 40% of the nation's beaches failed. Standards plummeted in the north-east, with the pass rate falling from 91% to 46%, while in the north-west, just 10% of beaches passed.</p> <p>There are 31,000 CSOs in the UK, and in October the European courts of justice ruled the UK had breached the EU urban waste water treatment directive with excessive discharges of raw sewage and storm water via CSOs. Tagholm said increased investment was needed to end the over-reliance of water companies on CSOs as a way to dispose of raw sewage. Surfers Against Sewage sent 100,000 text messages last year to warn subscribers of sewage overflows.</p> <p>In May, the Marine Conservation Society's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/03/rain-water-quality-uk-beaches\" title=\"\">Good Beach Guide found that one-third of the 750 beaches</a> it surveyed failed its standard.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2012/11/06/bathing-water/\" title=\"\">Defra said water quality</a> had improved over the last two decades, reflecting the investment of an estimated \u00a32.5bn by water companies since privatisation. Defra is now discussing further investment with water companies to ensure that bathing water quality continues to improve.

  "<p>A Bradford bus driver should not have been sacked for being a member of the British National Party, the European court of human rights has ruled.</p> <p>Removing Arthur Redfearn, a BNP councillor, from his job transporting disabled passengers \u2013 most of whom were of Asian descent \u2013 breached his rights to freedom of association, the Strasbourg court declared.</p> <p>\"In a healthy democratic and pluralistic society, the right to freedom of association&#xa0;\u2026 must apply not only to people or associations whose views are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive, but also to those whose views offend, shock or disturb,\" the judgment said.</p> <p>The decision, by a majority of four votes to three, was one of three cases in a single day in which the United Kingdom was found to have violated individuals' rights under the European convention on human rights.</p> <p>The ruling on Redfearn, who was 56 when dismissed in 2004 by his employer, Serco, noted that: \"Prior to his political affiliation becoming public knowledge, no complaints had been made against him by service users or by his colleagues.</p> <p>\"Nevertheless, once he was elected as a local councillor for the BNP and complaints were received from unions and employees, he was summarily dismissed without any apparent consideration being given to the possibility of transferring him to a non-customer-facing role.\"</p> <p>It added: \"It was incumbent on the [UK] to take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect employees, including those with less than one year's service, from dismissal on grounds of political opinion or affiliation.\"</p> <p>Redfearn had initially appealed against his sacking on the grounds that he was the victim of race discrimination. An employment tribunal had, however, dismissed his claim in 2005, finding that any discrimination against him had been on health and safety grounds.</p> <p>His continued employment, the tribunal had said, could cause considerable anxiety among Serco's passengers and their carers. There was consequently a risk that Serco's vehicles could come under attack from opponents of the BNP.</p> <p>Redfearn had been refused leave to take his case to the House of Lords but pursued it at Strasbourg.</p> <p>The dissenting ruling by three ECHR judges, including the UK judge Sir Nicolas Bratza, found there had not been a violation of Article 11 of the convention, the right to freedom of association. Redfearn had been working for less than a year and his employment rights, they argued, were not as extensive as those who had been working for the qualifying one year period.</p> <p>\"In a complex area of social and economic policy,\" the three judges observed, \"it is in our view pre-eminently for parliament to decide what areas require special protection in the field of employment and the consequent scope of any exception created to the general rule.\"</p> <p>In a separate case in Strasbourg, the UK was unanimously found to have discriminated against a Djibouti refugee, Hawa Aden Abdi, who was refused permission to join her husband in England.</p> <p>Abdii and Ilyas Elmi Hode, who have two children, married after he was granted asylum in the UK in 2006. The ECHR noted that UK immigration rules have since been amended.</p> <p>In a third judgment, the court found that the UK violated the rights to a fair trial within a reasonable time of a convicted murderer, William Beggs, 49, because his legal appeals had taken too long.</p> <p>In its ruling, the ECHR said: \"The appeal proceedings had lasted 10 years, three months and 21 days. Although the case was complex, this did not in itself justify appeal proceedings which lasted over 10 years.</p> <p>\"A substantial proportion of the delay had been caused by the applicant's own conduct. However, there were also periods of inactivity where the courts had failed to take steps to progress matters of their own motion, and this led the court to find a violation of the right to trial within a reasonable time.\"</p> <p>Beggs was awarded \u20ac6,000 (\u00a34,820) in damages and costs. The decision against the UK on delay is highly unusual. As the court added: \"The vast majority of [delay] cases involved Ukraine, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Poland. There was only one finding of a violation in respect of the United Kingdom.\"</p> <p>Audrey Williams, partner and discrimination law expert at global law firm Eversheds, commented:</p> <p>\"The government is likely to ask for the case to be referred to the Strasbourg court's grand chamber, to be re-examined by a full panel of 17 judges. It is not often that the grand chamber will agree to look again at an issue but it may well do so in this case given that Tuesday's decision was reached by the barest of majorities: of the 7 judges on the panel that considered the case, only four felt that UK law needs to change; the other three disagreed, saying our domestic law is fine as it is.</p> <p>\"If the grand chamber does not overrule today's decision, UK law will have to change to give employees with short service the right to claim unfair dismissal if they have been dismissed because of their political affiliation, for example because of BNP membership.</p> <p>\"At the moment only those with a year's service or more can bring such claims \u2013 or two years' service for those engaged after 5 April this year due to changes introduced recently by the government. Until the law is changed, private sector employees are unlikely to benefit from this ruling.\"</p> <p>A Department for Business Spokesperson said:</p> <p>\"While disappointed with the decision, we're pleased that the court has recognised the validity of a general qualifying period for the right to claim unfair dismissal. The court has also rightly recognised that a balance must be struck between the interests of employers and employees where these come into conflict due to an individual's political affiliation. The government will examine the detail of the judgment and decide on a way forward in due course.\"</p>",
  "<p>The launch of Everything Everywhere's 4G service in the UK has provided a pretext for some anti-piracy campaigners to raise the spectre of increased illegal file sharing as a result of the new network's much improved data transfer rates. In reality, this is more about frustration with the government's slowness in implementing the provisions of the Digital Economy Act than any real threat of widespread illegal file-sharing over 4G networks.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.fastiis.org/resources/press_details/id/1048/digital-economy-act-2010-dea-must-be-future-proofed-says-fast/\" title=\"\">press release</a> last month, the Federation Against Software Theft argued that the introduction of 4G networks (as well as wider availability of public Wi-Fi) justifies widening the scope of legal obligations placed on internet service providers to include mobile network operators. These obligations, aimed at inhibiting illegal sharing of copyrighted material and created by the 2010 Digital Economy Act, include sending warning letters to those suspected of illegal sharing, as well as logging the activities of repeat offenders. The press release also complained about foot-dragging by the government over implementing the original obligations to be placed on the fixed-line ISPs.</p> <p>It's interesting to note that none of the music industry trade bodies including the BPI, representing the major labels, and a tireless campaigner against music piracy, has so far joined Fast in raising the alarm over the introduction of 4G networks. Maybe this is because common sense suggests that widespread use of 4G networks for the illegal sharing of large video or music files remains improbable.</p> <p>In an excellent piece of analysis on mobile data pricing in <a href=\"http://www.mobileeurope.co.uk/news/blog/9519-where-next-for-mobile-data-pricing\" title=\"\">Mobile Europe</a> last month, Chris Goswami points out that mobile network operators are unlikely to offer widespread access to \"all-you-can-eat\" (AYCE) data plans. They are simply too expensive to support \u2013 a consumer with an AYCE data plan and a subscription to a music or movie streaming service could easily get through 10s of GB of data in a month. Goswami concludes that AYCE plans are a limited but important part of a mobile tariff mix designed to acquire and retain certain categories of mobile subscribers and will never be rolled out to the majority of consumers, scotching the suggestion that they'll be a substitute for fixed-line broadband. And, far from offering an AYCE tariff, EE's recently announced 4G data plans range from \u00a336pm for 500MB to \u00a356pm for 8GB \u2013 unaffordable for many consumers, especially teenagers.</p> <p>Moreover, at a more practical level, mobile networks across much of the UK, 3G or 4G, are frequently too unreliable for the high volume data transfer needed for music and video files.</p> <p>All of which said, copyright can be threatened when consumers are frustrated in doing what they want at a reasonable price, especially on mobile. For instance, the majority of streaming music services, whose main revenue source is monthly subscriptions, offer ad-supported free access to their music catalogues as part of a \"freemium\" business model (ie offering an initially free but limited service to encourage upgrade to a premium, paid-for service). But this isn't available on mobile devices, the primary means by which younger consumers access the internet. (In the US, teenagers <a href=\"http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/new-mobile-obsession-u-s-teens-triple-data-usage/\" title=\"\">tripled their usage of mobile data</a> over the course of 2011, far ahead of the growth in usage by other age groups.)</p> <p>Most teenagers are not likely to opt for a subscription streaming service, at an annual cost of \u00a3120 in the UK, nor are they likely to download tracks to own, which remains expensive on a per-track basis (typically 79p) for casual listening \u2013 leaving them little option but to resort to file sharing. This creates a clear gap in the market, which a number of different businesses have tried to fill, including Nokia's Comes With Music and Beyond Oblivion (a start-up backed by News Corp among other investors), with its ill-fated (or ill-executed) attempt to persuade handset makers to pay for the music that consumers would listen to over the life of a device.</p> <p>However, maybe it's the mobile industry itself that holds the key to solving the frustration of how to offer easy access to affordable music on mobile. A frustration articulated by Francis Keeling, Universal Music's global head of digital business, at The Great Escape music conference in 2011 when he asked: \"Why hasn't anyone come up with a worthwhile model for monetising music based on micropayments?\" The implication is clear \u2013 if the mobile industry could expand to reach whole new segments of the market through pre-pay (or pay-as-you-go) access to mobile telephony, why can't something similar be done to make music available to all mobile consumers \u2013 ie access to an unlimited personal jukebox, affordable for anyone and paid for via mobile phone?</p> <p><em>Martin Rigby is CEO of </em><a href=\"http://www.psonar.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Psonar</em></a><em>, the Cambridge-based streaming music service, as well as an investor in several other mobile and digital businesses.

The damage done, particularly to our eldest child has been quite profound and long-lasting. Both children require a level of parenting over and above the average and much of it differs from traditional styles. Both Rob and I have had to try and unpick the ways we were parented and learn new methods and approaches. There have been dramatic struggles with schooling, friendships, anger, aggression and anxiety. But we have shared the most brilliant times, laughs, closeness and affection too. Our struggles have deepened our connections and solidified our bonds. And every day is a new day, every hour a new hour.<br>Although some adoption experiences are smooth and untroubled, generally adoption is not for those who seek an averagely easy and dependable life. Adoptive parents have to be prepared to go the extra mile, to continue to learn, to advocate, to challenge, to educate and to accept support now and again. I have been stretched and challenged in ways I never would have thought possible, but I would do it all again in a heartbeat. I am a better, more tolerant person than I once was and when I sit amongst my often noisy and chaotic family, I am proud of what we have all achieved.<br>My advice to anyone considering adoption is to go into it with your eyes wide open. Go to as many courses and training sessions as you can, read all the books, talk to adopters and think about whether you have space in your life for a child who is going to need all the time, energy and love that you have, and some. If you have then you may just find yourself on the most extraordinary, exhausting, life-enhancing and rewarding ride of your life. </p> </blockquote> <p> <br>And thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ermintrude2\" title=\"\">Ermintrude</a> for sharing <a href=\"http://t.co/CqLyokw5\" title=\"\">this audio by adoptee Paul Coxon</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Jules Birch's latest Inside Housing blog on <strong>welfare reform</strong>, and the further changes - including he bedroom tax and overall benefit cap - <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/home/blogs/april-is-the-cruellest-month/6524520.blog\" title=\"\">being introduced next April</a>. He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Research so far into the impact of the 2011 changes (the bedroom caps and cut to 30th percentile) suggests that most tenants will look to make up rent shortfalls from elsewhere rather than move. The proportion moving out of the borough has been lower than expected so far, perhaps because transitional protection means the impact of the bedroom caps on existing claimants is only just being felt. However, staying put will become increasingly difficult as further cuts bite and larger families face the biggest shortfalls \u2013 and there is no transitional protection under the April 2013 cuts.<br>... Come April 2013, families will have three options: look for cheaper accommodation near to home or elsewhere; look for work of over 24 hours a week to avoid the benefit cap; or present as homeless to their local authority. If they are vulnerable and not intentionally homeless, then the council has to find them a suitable home and provide temporary accommodation in the meantime. From next week the home can be private rented.<br>Some councils are using discretionary housing payments to pay deposits or offer incentives to encourage landlords to take claimants \u2013 but this is only ever a short-term solution. Meanwhile, even outer London boroughs are finding they cannot match a supply of affordable accommodation to demand.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Disability campaigner and blogger Sue Marsh, who predicts a <a href=\"http://diaryofabenefitscrounger.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/esa-reaches-tipping-point.html?spref=tw\" title=\"\">\"tipping point\" for the new employment support allowance</a>. Anticipating the publication of government figures on the transfer of claimants from incapacity benefit to the ESA, she says the figures will show that Atos is not close to conducting the number of assessments the DWP predicted. And she adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is the game is up. Oh, the name might limp on \u2013 you know how politicians love to save face \u2013 but there are only two ways for ESA to go : It either has to improve drastically, beyond all recognition, in partnership with sick and disabled people or current protests will spill over into a terrible crisis for Britain.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 An extraordinary story from the 24dash site, which claims that a London-based ALMO managing social homes on behalf of Westminster council <a href=\"http://www.24dash.com/news/housing/2012-11-06-London-ALMO-offers-landlords-cash-reward-for-finding-MP-a-home\" title=\"\">is offering landlords a \u00a3150 reward for finding a flat for an MP</a>.

  "<p>Does gender equality contribute to economic growth? If yes, it might galvanise our growth-obsessed policymakers to take a more serious interest in gender equality. And does economic growth contribute to gender equality? If so, perhaps many hitherto sceptical feminists may take more interest in growth. We would have a win-win situation. But what if the answer to one of these questions is no?</p> <p>Luisa Natali and I have been sifting through the economic growth literature. These studies generally use nationally aggregated data drawn from different countries over different periods of time. We found fairly consistent evidence that greater gender equality in education and employment has made a positive contribution to economic growth (although a number of countries were able to compete in the early stages of their industrialisation by combining rising levels of female education with restrictions on female wages).</p> <p>The positive effect on growth operates through at least two routes. The direct route is via the market and the expanded pool of talent that results from increasing numbers of women with higher levels of education. It means that economies are maximising their human resource potential. As a catchy phrase coined by advocates within the World Bank puts it, \"<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsiteresources.worldbank.org%2FINTGENDER%2FResources%2FGAPNov2.pdf&amp;ei=8seXUK-oOubC0QXIqYGADw&amp;usg=AFQjCNE3AOgWOL5AJTXFfb14c4dTMRZCCQ\" title=\"\">gender equality is smart economics</a>\" (pdf). The indirect route is via the family and reflects the positive effect of women's education and employment on the next generation of workers, parents and citizens. As many studies have shown, women tend to be more likely than men to use the resources at their disposal to promote the nutrition, health and education of their children \u2013 sometimes closing the gender gap in these outcomes.</p> <p>The evidence for the reverse relationship \u2013 that economic growth leads to greater gender equality \u2013 is far weaker, less consistent and sometimes negative. While this might appear counterintuitive, it reflects the fact that the forces that give rise to affluence are not necessarily the same forces that give rise to gender equality.</p> <p>Look at Saudi Arabia and Ghana. Saudi Arabia is among the wealthiest countries in the world, with a <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD\" title=\"\">per capita GDP of $16,423 in 2010</a> but ranked 131 out of 135 countries in the World Economic Forum's <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-gender-gap-report-2011\" title=\"\">2011 Global Gender Gap Report</a>. Ghana, with a per capita GDP of only $1,319 in the same year, ranked 70. China and India, with respective growth of 10.6% and 9.6% in 2010, ranked 61 and 113 respectively <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21565617-bangladesh-has-dysfunctional-politics-and-stunted-private-sector-yet-it-has-been-surprisingly?frsc=dg|a\" title=\"\">while Bangladesh</a>, with a growth rate of 6.1% and considerably poorer than the other two, ranked 69. India and China both report abnormally high rates of mortality among girls relative to boys as well as selective abortion by parents who want only or mainly sons. In Bangladesh, on the other hand, girls' survival chances are improving relative to boys and there is little evidence of sex-selective abortion.</p> <p>So what are the options facing those of us who would like to see a fairer world for both men and women? The first possibility is that where economic growth is accompanied by greater gender equality in employment and education, the implications for women's wellbeing and rights, as well as social attitudes to gender equality, are likely to be positive. In other words, women's economic empowerment can be a pivotal factor in transforming the opportunities generated by economic growth into broader gender equality.</p> <p>Second, affirmative action by the state can address some of the constraints that prevent women from taking advantage of the opportunities generated by growth and help to improve its distributional impact.</p> <p>There is growing recognition that the pattern of growth matters as much as its pace: controlling inflation and balancing budgets may be important, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/nov/05/ha-joon-chang-jobs-policies-street-video\" title=\"\">the quantity and quality of jobs is crucial</a> (video). Men and women must be able to share in the benefits of growth rather than finding themselves competing for scarce and poorly paid jobs in a shrinking labour market. We might want to revise the World Bank's catchphrase into something less instrumental: gender equality may be smart economics but it also offers the promise of more human-centred growth.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://nailakabeer.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Naila Kabeer</em></a><em> is professor of development studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies.

  "<p>Youth unemployment in both wealthy and developing nations is in part due to a dearth of skills training. In turn, the lack of economic opportunities for the world's young workers is one of the most pressing challenges for governments struggling to maintain their legitimacy and for businesses starving for talent.</p> <p>If the global business community is to benefit from qualified and well-trained employees in the coming years, information communications technology (ICT) capacity will be critical in every sector \u2013 from agriculture and manufacturing to the creative arts.</p> <p>Since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, many ICT firms have worked with governments to bridge the digital divide. Nevertheless, free or low-cost broadband is only a bridge to nowhere if young people do not have the necessary technical skills to contribute.</p> <p>And as government austerity programmes, coupled with the soaring cost of education, deliver a one-two punch that pushes skills training out of reach, it is now even more important that companies step in if they are guaranteed a pipeline of future talent and stable markets in which to conduct business.</p> <p>One of the world's largest software companies, <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Microsoft</a>, believes its new programme focused on innovative technology education can inspire the world's youth to empower themselves. <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/en-us/youthspark/\" title=\"\">YouthSpark</a> is a new company-wide initiative to erase the gap between young workers who already benefit from skills training, and their peers who cannot afford nor access it.</p> <h2>More than technical skills</h2> <p>For more than a decade Microsoft had worked on solving the pesky challenges of the digital divide, but in recent years it realised that problems were more than simply about access to technology. With young workers struggling to gain a foothold in the global workforce \u2013 young adults often have an unemployment rate double their older peers in many nations \u2013 the company decided the issue was that students as young as six needed expanded opportunities for education, employment or entrepreneurship.</p> <p>Not only do children and teens need to learn technical skills, but, according to Microsoft's general manager for citizenship and public affairs, Lori Harnick, they must be inspired, empowered and realise their dreams.</p> <p>For Microsoft to become an agent of change, the company had to rethink its decades-old traditional philanthropic approach of donations to charities. Meanwhile, as the company grew across geographic regions and product lines, business units throughout the company were quick to start programmes benefiting youth. Last year the company's citizenship team decided to link many programmes together, streamline others and create new ones to help young talent compete in a complex world.</p> <p>After 18 months in the planning, YouthSpark promises to provide support to as many as 300 million young people from the ages of six to 24 at a cost of $500m (\u00a3309m) over the next three years. Grouped into three areas, two dozen programs will offer a variety of initiatives to students, young professionals and teachers.</p> <p>Some programmes leverage the company's products, such as <a href=\"https://education.skype.com/\" title=\"\">Skype In The Classroom</a>, to connect with thought-leaders across the world and expose students to subjects ranging from environmental sustainability to the creative arts. <a href=\"https://www.dreamspark.com/\" title=\"\">DreamSpark</a> provides design and developer software programs at no cost to students who otherwise would not be able to afford them. In turn children can create games for the PC or XBox via <a href=\"http://www.kodugamelab.com/\" title=\"\">Kodu Game Lab</a>, which helps channel these budding software developers to express themselves creatively, learn storytelling techniques or boost their creativity.</p> <p>As students become old enough to join the global workforce, they can participate in <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/\" title=\"\">BizSpark</a>, a programme that allows them to link to investors, mentors and other entrepreneurs.</p> <h2>A lifelong career-building curriculum</h2> <p>Microsoft says that the way it conceptualised YouthSpark could allow millions to use it as a lifelong career-building curriculum, culminating in the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/studentstobusiness/students/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Microsoft Students to Business</a> initiative that has so far linked 15,000 students to internships and jobs with Microsoft's partners and customers in 65 nations.</p> <p>One successful programme running in the US is the brainchild of Kevin Wang, a Microsoft engineer who was concerned about the lack of computer science education in high schools. In 2009, Wang started volunteering his time to teach computer science at a Seattle high school on the way to work.</p> <p>Microsoft executives caught wind of his work and funded his idea. Wang then developed a curriculum, and a year later <a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoftupblog/archive/2012/10/03/microsoft-expands-teals-program.aspx\" title=\"\">Technology Education and Literacy in Schools</a> (Teals) was launched. Now the programme, which includes a three-month volunteering program for engineers interested in teaching computer science, has rolled out to 37 schools and 2,000 students in five more states and the District of Columbia.</p> <p>For Microsoft and its 94,000 employees, YouthSpark offers many channels through which they can contribute to their communities' efforts to bolster education and mentoring in a more competitive world. But this massive program is more than just volunteering or donating money \u2013 by tapping into the latent talent of millions of young people, the company could very well contribute to economic growth and therefore strengthen its future business. After all, a technologically-savvy population is one that can afford and uses the products of Microsoft and its competitors.</p> <p>Companies mulling over programmes similar to that of Microsoft's should view it as more than doing good on a global scale \u2013 it is also about their viability in a rapidly changing and fiercely competitive world.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>You probably haven't heard much of Maurice Holmes, a little magician who turns the ball both ways. But Ricky Ponting has. Ponting first came across him in the indoor nets at Kent. And, like every other batsman facing Holmes for the first time, he had a little trouble telling the wrong'un from the right'un. \"I've never seen anything like that,\" Ponting said after they were done. The second time they met was in Sydney, when Holmes was playing grade cricket for St George. \"Oh,\" Ponting said when he saw Holmes standing at the far end of the nets. \"Not you again.\"</p> <p>Like a lot of us, Holmes first learned to play cricket with his brothers in the back garden. The difference between Maurice and you, me, and pretty much everyone else, was that he was a natural. He blessed with a talent that can't be taught, not for batting, or bowling fast, but for the most mercurial and elusive of skills \u2013 spinning the ball. And not just any old how. He was born with wrists that can bend in all sorts of different directions, and his shoulder blades, he has been told, are \"physiologically in the wrong place\". He started bowling off breaks with a cocked elbow and a curled wrist. Back then he couldn't have told you what he was doing, or how he did it, but Maurice had learned to bowl the doosra.</p> <p>\"It felt the most natural way to bowl,\" Holmes says. \"Using my wrist rather than my fingers, I didn't know anything much about what I was doing. As far as I knew there was a bloke in every village bowling like that.\"</p> <p>When he was 16, Holmes, who had never even played in a match of any sort, went along to his first net session at Tonbridge School. There, he caught the eye of coach Paul Parker, who had played a single Test for England in 1981. Parker put Holmes straight into Tonbridge's 'A' team, and a few weeks after that, the first XI. In the winter of 2008-09, at the indoor nets in Kent, Holmes bowled at Rob Key, who, as Maurice remembers it, was one of a bunch of batsmen who \"danced past a doosra\". Kent asked him to join their academy that same day.</p> <p>The World Twenty20 was in England the following summer, and Holmes had heard that their were opportunities for net bowlers up at the Oval. Soon he was bowling to New Zealand's batsmen. \"He rocked up,\" remembered coach Andy Moles, \"and the boys said 'Bloody hell, this is just like facing Murali.'\"</p> <p>New Zealand were so impressed that they took him up to Trent Bridge to help them prepare for their match against Sri Lanka in the Super Eights. A couple of months later Moles asked Holmes if he wanted to travel with the Test team to Sri Lanka to work as a net bowler, a chance he leapt at. Daniel Vettori was particularly impressed with the kid, and he and a couple of other senior players had asked the coaching staff to invite Holmes along. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/slvnz2009/content/story/419716.html\" title=\"\">He spent that tour working with Saqlain Mushtaq, who had been hired as a specialist coach, honing his bowling in the nets</a>.</p> <p>Back home in the early autumn, Holmes had some net sessions with England. Jon Trott and Ian Bell were so impressed by his bowling that they told Ashley Giles to invite him for a trial at Warwickshire. \"So I spent an hour or two bowling at them in the nets. And at the end of it I was offered a contract on the spot. That,\" he says, with a little understatement, \"was the end of a pretty amazing season.\"</p> <p>Like Parker, Moles, Key, and Vettori, Giles reckoned that in Holmes he had discovered an unpolished gem of a player. So, the question is, why haven't you heard more of Maurice Holmes, the English mystery spinner? The answer, sadly, is that despite his obvious talent, he has been hounded out of first-class cricket. Holmes spent this last season playing for Sevenoaks Vine CC in the Kent League; meanwhile he is studying for a law degree in Birmingham. He hasn't given up on cricket, yet, but he is beginning to feel as though the game has given up on him.</p> <p>\"There has always been talk about my action,\" Holmes says. \"It has followed me around, questions about whether it is legal, and how different it is.\" After that trial at Warwickshire in 2009 he went for his first biomechanical test at Loughborough. He failed it, and the contract offer was withdrawn. Undeterred, he decided to enrol at Loughborough University, reckoning it would be the best place to work on his action. \"Every morning, six days a week, I was bowling in the nets for two hours, while everyone else was recovering from their hangovers.\" He worked with Saqlain, and with the ECB spin coach Peter Such, and between them they ironed out the kinks in his action.</p> <p>Early in 2010 he got himself tested again, and passed. So Giles got back in touch and asked him to come and play for Warwickshire's second XI. He did so well that the club offered him a contract for 2011. He made his first team debut at the start of 2011, against Durham MCCU, and took a wicket with his very first ball. And then, soon after, he was reported again.</p> <p>Holmes failed his next test in Loughborough, not because the bend in his arm exceeded the 15 degree limit \u2013 it didn't \u2013 but because the analysts decided that his bowling was \"not match representative\". They were comparing his action with footage taken eight weeks before, and he had changed the way he gathered himself as he entered his bowling stride. The England and Wales Cricket Board made little attempt to examine the nuances of his case. They simply put out <a href=\"http://www.ecb.co.uk/ecb/about-ecb/media-releases/holmes-suspended-from-bowling,314888,EN.html\" title=\"\">a press release announcing that he had been suspended from county cricket</a>.</p> <p>The Professional Cricketers Association and the Warwickshire coach Dougie Brown stood by Holmes. They petitioned the ECB on his behalf, got him another test, and split the cost of it between them. This time, his off break was passed. But his doosra wasn't. Again, it wasn't because his arm was bending more than 15 degrees \u2013 it wasn't \u2013 but because the analysts decided that he was bowling it too slowly. They had clocked his fastest ball in a match, and wanted him to reproduce that speed with a doosra in the laboratory. He couldn't.</p> <p>So Maurice was \"warned\" against using the doosra in a match. He was actually told that the delivery was still legal, but that the authorities would be \"watching him very closely\" if he used it in a match. <a href=\"http://www.ecb.co.uk/ecb/about-ecb/media-releases/holmes,316059,EN.html?Pf=com.otherobjects.cms.model.structure.Folder-L-250\" title=\"\">Again, this nuance got lost along the way</a>.</p> <p>Since then, Maurice, still only 22, has pretty much been out on his own. He paid his way to go to the Global Cricket Academy in India, and has had a trial with Somerset and some interest from one or two other clubs, but his career has gone cold. Word has gone around the circuit that Holmes is a chucker, and the ECB have made no effort to correct or clarify the situation. A man with the rarest and most precious of talents has been frozen out of the game.</p> <p>Sometimes, it can be all too easy to criticise the ECB. But in this case the governing body has done an extremely poor job of nurturing a good young player, and their uneasiness about the situation was evident in the perfunctory, dismissive manner in which they respondd to enquiries about it. The Spin contacted Dr Mark King, the specialist who conducts the biomechanical tests at Loughborough, to try to clarify Holmes's situation. He referred us back to the ECB, who then provided a routine statement referring back to the rules and regulations. King has been subject to a little scrutiny recently. George Dobell, of Cricinfo, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/587767.html\" title=\"\">wrote an excellent piece on the testing being done at Loughborough</a>, explaining that the ICC do not currently recognise the results of tests conducted by the ECB.</p> <p>In the meantime, the career of an exceptionally talented cricketer has been completely derailed. Holmes worries that the ECB have been \"duplicitous\" by suggesting that he has been banned from using the doosra, when in fact he has only been warned about it. And of course, there has been no public explanation that when he bowls his doosra, and his off break, his arm is within the 15 degree limit stipulated by the ICC. \"I just think there has been a huge amount of misunderstanding,\" he says. \"Umpires don't understand my situation, and don't know it.\"</p> <p>If the ECB were serious about encouraging the development of doosra bowlers and other unorthodox spinners, they would surely have found a more sympathetic way to deal with Holmes that would have kept him in the game, and, at the very least, helped him fix any problems he has. But they haven't.</p> <p>In Australia national selector John Inverarity has said the decision about whether or not <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/story/588225.html\" title=\"\">the doosra should be taught to young bowlers is \"a question of integrity\"</a>, because he is not sure it can be bowled legally. Many people in England, it seems, would agree with him, though they haven't come out and said it. Holmes is not one of them. \"It is proven that you can bowl the doosra within the limits; that is a scientific fact, there is no morality about it. I have proven that I can bowl it within the limits.\" It feels as though a confederacy of conservatives is at work against him.</p> <p>\"There will always be the English view, that something different is not necessarily something good,\" Holmes says. \"There are people who tend to take the traditional view that things can and should only be done in one way.\"</p> <p>Maurice Holmes may not have gone on to be a great bowler. His is the hardest of arts to master. But right now he has not even had the chance to try, and it is not for any lack of effort or willingness on his part. The authorities have failed him. \"I would love to be bowling for a county and showing them what I can do,\" he says. \"I would love to be and representing the English game because as far as I know there is no one else out there who can bowl the doosra.\" And if his experience is anything to judge by, there never will be.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/signup/2010/mar/30/1\" title=\"\"><em>This is an extract from the Spin, the Guardian's free weekly cricket email.

This is a claim you've probably heard before many times, often stated as an indisputable fact rather than personal opinion. Given that you're currently reading the Guardian science section, it's reasonably safe to assume that you do not agree. People tend not to actively seek out things they find boring, unless it's for work or education purposes. And if this blog ever achieves the status of \"required reading\" for anything, the field of science is in deep trouble. </p> <p>Obviously those who are willing to blog about science don't find it boring, but I don't necessarily have any issue with those who do. A lot of science is not intuitive or is presented in <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/11/24/on-jargon-and-why-it-matters-in-science-writing/\">impenetrable language</a> for those not trained in it, and although a crucial element of education it's often presented in a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/primaryeducation/9146011/Half-of-children-find-science-and-maths-too-difficult-or-too-boring.html\">dry or overly challenging way.</a> Some of the fault can be attributed to individuals perhaps; just because understanding something is more challenging than you'd like is no reason to abandon it and write off the whole field as \"boring\". And the mainstream media \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2005/sep/08/badscience.research\">dumbing down</a>\" science stories in a way that can be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/may/01/neuroscience-fiction\">actively misleading</a> probably doesn't help. </p> <p>But it could be argued that scientists themselves are part of the problem. I've lost count of the number of lectures and talks I've gone to where the speaker makes no attempt to engage the audience or make the material in any way relevant. My remit for this blog is to try and make science stories/ideas amusing in some way. From comments I've been getting, some think even attempting this is a disgraceful abomination. Some seem to think you shouldn't write anything about science that you wouldn't be willing to have tattooed onto your own forehead, so seriously should you take the subject matter. Thanks to a receding hairline, I may have more forehead space than most, but I'm not going to be doing that. I'm saving it for advertising space for when I get desperate. But this furious response to any attempt to make science entertaining can't be helpful in promoting it, surely? Unless you're targeting the \"enjoys getting angry at things they don't really understand\" demographic, aka \"Twitter\". </p> <p>(Also, if you are one of the people who feel this way, you might want to stop reading now, you really won't like what's coming up.)</p> <p>However, it's fine to argue that science is not persistently boring, or not as boring as people think, but to imply that it's never boring is actually quite misleading. If we're talking people looking up things about science that they're interested in, then that's fair enough. But much of the \"science isn't boring\" bunch seems to be focussed on<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/may/01/neuroscience-fiction\"> schools,</a> encouraging children to choose a career in science. I've said this <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/brain-flapping/2012/jul/31/what-is-science-google\">before</a>, but suggesting that science is all cool explosions and spectacular effects is going to lead to some disappointment. </p> <p>Fact is, working in science can be rather dull. It depends on the specific field of course, but most people would be hard pressed to argue that their science job is a non-stop roller-coaster of excitement. Any job will involve many mundane elements that have to be dealt with; this doesn't mean they're not interesting fields to be in. It just seems that with science, that's the only part many people are aware of. </p> <p>A personal anecdote (not that that <a href=\"http://osmosis-online.com/2010/01/09/seeing-is-not-always-believing-why-anecdotal-evidence-is-not-proof/\">constitutes evidence</a>, I know) demonstrates to me how boring some people find working in science. </p> <p>As is traditional when working in a laboratory, in the UK at least, <a href=\"http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=3255\">health and safety practice</a> is of paramount importance. Idle hands are said to be the devil's plaything, but idle hands with access to very dangerous, volatile substances make the devil wag his finger and make discouraging noises. For many people assigned to laboratory roles, it is required that you undergo basic safety training, such as <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh/\">COSHH</a> (care of substances hazardous to health).</p> <p>When I started a new role in a busy lab, I had to go on a COSHH course. We covered preparing <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/fivesteps.htm\">risk assessments</a>. To facilitate this, whomever your company/institution purchases the chemicals from is legally required to include <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh/basics/datasheets.htm\">chemical safety data sheets.</a> These sheets should list all the potential hazards presented by the chemical in question, what can happen in case of accidents, what to do about it in this scenario, and so on. We were given several different examples of these sheets.</p> <p>One of the sheets was for the chemical hydrochloric acid, <a href=\"http://www.reagent.co.uk/hydrochloric-acid\">HCl</a>. HCl is <br>produced naturally in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_acid\">human stomach</a>, to aid digestion. Much of the stomach lining is dedicated to <a href=\"http://health.howstuffworks.com/human-body/systems/digestive/question464.htm\">keeping the whole organ from degrading</a> as a result. A small amount of gastric acid entering the oesophagus can cause serious pain, <a href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146619.php\">heartburn</a>.</p> <p>HCl is very powerful stuff. If anyone argues that something is safe because it's \"natural\", they clearly haven't encountered it. A small whiff of it can be quite overwhelming, although it's a good way of dealing with excessive nostril hair. </p> <p>So, these safety sheets detailed what to do if you get it on your skin, eyes, swallow it and so forth. One was extra thorough and covered what to do if HCl is \"administered anally\". The precise details and consequences of such an occurrence listed lead to only one possible conclusion; this has actually happened to someone.</p> <p>HCl isn't generally available in pure form outside the laboratory environment. And even if somebody bizarrely interpreted a \"Lab coats must be worn\" instruction as meaning ONLY lab coats should be worn, someone leaving a narrow conical flask of HCl on the floor for them to fall onto is another unlikely occurrence. Both combined is astronomically improbable. Ergo, the most likely explanation is that someone experienced this \"administration\" deliberately. </p> <p>I don't care what the evidence says; it shouldn't be possible to be THAT bored! It can be tedious working in a lab on some monotonous task, but go for a coffee or a cigarette or something if it gets that bad. And if anyone feels I'm wrong to encourage caffeine or nicotine consumption because they're unhealthy, please remember the alternative in this context.</p> <p>There's nothing to confirm that whoever experienced this ultimate enema was actually a scientist or working in the scientific field, I just find it hard to imagine a scenario where they weren't, given the way HCl and labs work. I may be wrong about this. </p> <p>But I always think of this anecdote as a good example of how, even when boring, science produces some very attention-grabbing outcomes. Whether it be <a href=\"http://blogs.sciencemag.org/sciencecareers/2012/08/monkey-business.html\">drunkenly partying with lab monkeys,</a> or i<a href=\"http://www.drtribe.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=753:when-scientists-get-bored&amp;catid=16:life&amp;Itemid=182\">dly producing some bizarre but award-winning reports</a>, a bored scientist can still pique people's interest (albeit often inadvertently).</p> <p>Ergo, I'd argue that the mainstream tendency to assume that science and scientists are boring and need explaining in simple terms in order to make people want to hear about it is rather unfair. This logic isn't extended to other complex areas such as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19967194\">economics</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20207345\">politics</a>, so why does science get filtered in this way? As my friend and The Sky At Night team member<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20207345\"> Chris North</a> once pointed out, it's difficult to imagine a scenario where the latest <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/fixtures\">football fixtures</a> would include a very simple explanation of what the football actually is and how it works, for those who weren't interested in it. It's assumed that people already know this complex data. Unless it's about science. </p> <p>It's true that some find science boring, and that's OK, but can we stop assuming that <strong>everyone</strong> does? </p> <p>On the subject, do check out <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00zxmqd\">Dara O'Briain's Science Club</a>, tonight on BBC 2, which will hopefully demonstrate that science can be entertaining without losing the details. Seriously, it'll be good, and there's nothing else interesting on, apart from some political thing, but who cares about politics? </p> <p><em>Check out how boring Dean Burnett's career is by following him on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">@garwboy</a>.

  "<p>First, a confession: I'm jealous of another newspaper. That's not something you hear very often in journalism, but the Times's <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/cyclesafety/\">Cycle Safe</a> campaign is worthy of an exception.<br> For any newspaper to devote the energy, resources and sheer bloody-mindedness to a major push on a subject relatively few Britons possibly care much about is admirable. That it's the Times, still arguably the paper of the Jaguar-driving management classes, makes it all the more unusual and (hopefully) effective.</p> <p>This is no mere call for tinkering by the paper. Yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/leaders/article3589937.ece\">its leading article</a> on the campaign explicitly named Copenhagen as the model for the future, calling for wholesale segregated cycle lanes. The paper said, wisely: \"It is not enough to daub a few roads with streaks of blue.\" </p> <p>Today's edition arguably goes even further, with a <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/cyclesafety/article3591103.ece\">news story introducing readers to the notion of \"peak car\"</a> and the possibility that the age of the bicycle might be upon us. This is bold stuff.</p> <p>So, before I say anything else, hats off to those leading the efforts, the Times's transport correspondent, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philippank\">Philip Pank</a> and the tireless <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kayaburgess\">Kaya Burgess</a>, who's written much of the coverage, plus their editor, James Harding.</p> <p>And look what they've achieved: we're going to get a <a href=\"http://allpartycycling.org/2012/11/05/mps-launch-a-cross-party-inquiry-into-cycling/\">full-blown, all party parliamentary inquiry into getting Britain cycling</a>. Anyone can submit written arguments by 5 December, and the inquiry will hear in person from the cycling great and good at six evidence sessions in January and February next year.</p> <p>This is, for any cyclist wearily used to be being ignored and marginalised by those in power, extremely good news. I say that even while simultaneously having my doubts about what this all might achieve.</p> <p>Before I get to my personal gloom let me ask: who would you like to see give evidence to the inquiry sessions?</p> <p>I'll offer two ideas of my own. Firstly Chris Boardman, for his ability (see below - he starts at 2m 20s) to talk complete sense about cycling, especially putting worries about safety \u2013 something I occasionally fear the Times campaign overplays \u2013 into context.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kjaHH8YR7Pg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kjaHH8YR7Pg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But more important still I'd like to see <a href=\"http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/people/david-horton%288df546f0-87ff-4577-bccf-62f8dafeb6e1%29.html\">Dr Dave Horton</a> give his views. Unlike Boardman he is not a celebrity. Horton is a sociologist at Lancaster university who led a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/jun/03/britons-unmoved-cycling-campaigns\">study that, more than anything, changed my views on cycle policy</a>. The simply-titled Understanding Walking and Cycling took an in depth look into the actual, everyday decisions on transport made by people in four towns and cities around England.</p> <p>For cycle campaigners the message was grim: the bulk of people are utterly unmoved my pro-cycling campaigns; most have no interest in riding a bike for everyday transport; the bike is seen as \"either a toy for children or a vehicle fit only for the poor and/or strange\".</p> <p>What put people off was safety, meaning the only way to get the masses onto bikes is through a wholesale construction of segregated bike lanes, nationwide.</p> <p>It seems a like a contradictory message to Boardman's, but both are right. Cycling is, overall, pretty safe. But most people don't think so, and won't till the infrastructure improves. That is the key message: any serious change must be led from above, with bold government action. Build the bike lanes and they will come. </p> <p>And that's why I have my doubts. I have great faith in the <a href=\"http://allpartycycling.org/\">Commons all-party cycling group</a>, that will lead the new inquiry. But I simply don't believe this government has the will or the vision to take up the Times's challenge.</p> <p>I've <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bike-blog/2012/may/25/cycling-governed-dimwits\">written before about how those supposedly in charge of cycling policy have shown themselves to be ill-informed and inept</a>. One example is worth repeating as it's so shocking: at the last set-piece parliamentary gaze into cycling, a <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/transport-committee/news/cycle-ministers-twitter-answers/\">session in April of the transport select committee</a>, The junior transport minister Norman Baker, seen as the voice of cycling in the Department for Transport, cheerfully boasted that the UK had lower cycle deaths per head of population than the Netherlands and was thus a safer cycling country, completely neglecting to mention that Dutch cycling rates are 10 times higher than here. I genuinely can't remember a more foolish thing said by a government minister.</p> <p>It's not just dimwittery, I also mistrust the government's motives. It came into power <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1278161/Labours-13-year-war-motorist-pledges-new-Transport-Secretary.html\">promising to end the supposed \"war on the motorist\"</a> and has seemingly been true to its word \u2013 at a grave cost to other, more vulnerable road users. Deaths and serious injuries among cyclists, pedestrians and motorcyclists <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/releases/reported-road-casualties-gb-main-results-2011/\">rose sharply last year</a>, reversing the long-term trend. This <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/13/road-deaths-rise-uk-safety\">very well-researched and deeply depressing article</a> from last month explains why this might have happened.</p> <p>None of this is to diminish in any way the Times's efforts, or to downplay their possible impact over time. But I'd just say this: don't hold your breath.</p> <p>So over to you. Am I being too gloomy? And who would you like to see at the inquiry?</p>",
  "<p>Judging by the reactions on Twitter yesterday, fashion insiders were just as surprised as the rest of us when the news broke that Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re would be leaving Balenciaga, the label he has been creative director of since 1997. British Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman called the 41 year old \"unarguably one of the biggest talents in fashion\", while street-style photographer Tommy Ton described himself as \"totally blindsided and in shock\". The plaudits are still coming.</p> <p>The designer parting ways with Balenciaga is certainly something of a shock. Profits for its parent company PPR, which also owns Gucci, Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney, were <a href=\"http://www.fashionunited.co.uk/fashion-news/design/ppr-q3-revenues-up-66-percent-2012102616080\" title=\"\">up 6.6% in the third quarter</a> of 2012. Cathy Horyn, fashion editor of the New York Times, said that PPR's founder, Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, was <a href=\"http://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/05/nicolas-ghesquiere-to-leave-balenciaga/\" title=\"\">a supporter of Ghesqui\u00e8re</a>, deciding to stick with him when the retail group bought Balenciaga more than a decade ago. Spotted backstage at the spring 2013 show, Pinault had been masterminding the label's expansion into the Asian market.</p> <p>Ghesqui\u00e8re has been instrumental in making Balenciaga relevant for a new generation. Originally founded in 1937 by Spanish designer Cristobal Balenciaga, the house was known for a sculptural use of volume, nipped in suits and vivid colour, signifying looks that were popular until Balenciaga retired in 1968. Ghesqui\u00e8re gave these codes a modern touch. \"He was one of the first to dust off an iconic house and introduce a whole new generation of fans to the brand,\" says Gabrielle Hackworthy, fashion director of Harper's Bazaar.</p> <p>Honing an aesthetic known for its layered silhouettes, innovative fabric choices and a touch of bad taste, Ghesqui\u00e8re has managed to make scuba-wear, ditsy florals and sci-fi logos into edgy must-have items. Spring/summer 2013 was no exception. <a href=\"http://www.style.com/fashionshows/review/S2013RTW-BALENCIA\" title=\"\">Style.com </a>praised his ability to \"season in and season out \u2026 put an utterly modern gloss on intense study of the house's archives\". An association with Kristen Stewart (<a href=\"http://www.shineon-media.com/2012/06/30/kristen-stewart-face-of-balenciaga-paris-florabotanica-fragrance/\" title=\"\">the face of the Florabotanica perfume</a>) also gave the brand a mainstream element, which can't have hurt sales.</p> <p>With sales up and critical acclaim from all sides, you have to ask what's behind this decision. While <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/2012/11/05/nicolas-ghesquiere-is-leaving-balenciaga/#axzz2BMoihwTE\" title=\"\">some commentators have mused</a> that other brands in the PPR stable (Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci) are being prioritised, there's little to be read from <a href=\"http://www.ppr.com/en/press/press-releases/balenciaga-fashion-house-and-nicolas-ghesquiere-announce-their-joint-decision-e\" title=\"\">Pinault's statement,</a> which describes the decision as \"joint\" and praises Ghesqui\u00e8re's \"incomparable creative talent\". Perhaps Ghesqui\u00e8re, who has so far remained silent, felt it was time for a new challenge. No names have been put forward as his replacement, and for now the fashion world is far more interested in working out Ghesqui\u00e8re's next move. The New York Times is reporting rumours of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/business/global/top-designer-for-balenciaga-to-leave.html\" title=\"\">his own label at LVMH</a>.</p> <p>\"I am shocked that he has stepped down,\" says Hackworthy. \"But also so excited about what his future holds.\" She's not the only one.</p>",
  "<p>One of the <a href=\"http://www.ukip.org/\">UK Independence Party</a>'s (Ukip) popular battle cries in recent years has been its condemnation of the European parliament wasting taxpayers' money on its bureaucrats and pet projects. It's a political strategy that has, in part, helped it to steadily improve its poll rating.</p> <p>But, following a rather frustrating exchange of emails with the party, I would argue that Ukip has its own questions to answer over its use of taxpayers' money on its officials and pet causes.</p> <p>The story started back in September when I spotted an intriguing detail on the latest \"<a href=\"http://www.ukipmeps.org/mypage_16_TR.html\">transparency report</a>\" registered by <a href=\"http://www.godfreybloommep.co.uk/\">Godfrey Bloom</a>, the Ukip MEP for Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire who is currently running for police commissioner of Humberside Police. It stated (<a href=\"http://www.ukipmeps.org/uploads/file/Bloom%20Jul-Dec%202011.pdf\">pdf</a>) that, up to at least December 2011, he had two part-time researchers working for him. They were described as a \"climate and environment researcher\" and a \"religious and confidential researcher\".</p> <p>Bloom is known for his climate scepticism and hostility towards wind turbines, but it was a surprise to me to learn that he had a dedicated, part-time researcher working for him on such issues. Given that Bloom is not UKIP's official environment spokesman (that honour fell to Lord Monckton until earlier this year when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/jun/22/rio-20-summit-final-day-live-blog#block-13\">he was replaced</a> by <a href=\"http://www.ukipmeps.org/news_608_UKIP-launches-new-energy-policy.html\">Roger Helmer</a>), what did this researcher actually do? And how much was he/she paid?</p> <p>So, on 28 September, I emailed Gawain Towler, Ukip's press spokesman:</p> <blockquote> <p>Please can you help me with this query? I notice on Godfrey Bloom's transparency documents held on the EFD Group website that he has had a part-time \"climate and environment researcher\" since 2009. Please can you tell me who this researcher is and how much they are paid out of EFD Group/EU parliament funding?</p> </blockquote> <p>(N.B. \"EFD\" stands for <a href=\"http://www.efdgroup.eu/\">Europe of Freedom and Democracy</a>, the political group that Ukip MEPs belong to in the EU parliament.)</p> <p>A few hours later I received an email directly from Ben Pile, who runs the anti-environmentalism <a href=\"http://www.climate-resistance.org/\">Climate Resistance blog</a> and who <a href=\"http://www.spiked-online.com/site/article/12737/\">writes on occasion for Spiked</a>, as well as convening a Spiked-partnered \"<a href=\"http://www.oxfordsalon.org.uk/\">salon</a>\" in Oxford: </p> <blockquote> <p>Hi Leo, I'm pretty sure you knew already! FYI.</p> <p>Salary 2009 - Jul 2010: \u00a3700/month.<br>Salary Jul 2010 - Aug 2011: \u00a326.4kpa.<br>Since Summer 2011, I have been contracted, rather than salaried to work for Godfrey Bloom/EFD. Works out at about \u00a32,000/month including expenses +/- other projects.</p> <p>Have a good weekend. Ben</p> </blockquote> <p>This surprised me to some extent: both to learn the identity of the researcher, as well as the sums he was receiving for his part-time research role.</p> <p>As Pile alluded to, I knew he had done some previous work with Bloom and EFD (making an anti-wind turbine film called <a href=\"http://www.europesillwind.org/\">Europe's Ill Wind</a> in 2010 via his company called Polimedia Ltd; he also <a href=\"http://www.ukip.org/content/video-zone/2459-wind-turbines-and-the-countryside-blight\">made a speech</a> at the Ukip conference in 2011), but I didn't realise he had been Bloom's part-time researcher over such a long period.</p> <p>I replied to Pile and Towler:</p> <blockquote> <p>Thanks. Actually, I didn't know for sure. I just happened to notice that it said \"climate and environment researcher\" on that register and was curious to know who it was. Yes, I had a pretty good hunch it might be you as you had made that wind video for Godfrey a while back, but nice to have it confirmed. What does Godfrey get for \u00a32000 a month then? That suggests to me quite a bit of work?</p> </blockquote> <p>Towler then emailed:</p> <blockquote> <p>I think, Ben can correct me, that this is from Godfrey's secretarial/research allowance rather than direct from EFD funds.</p> </blockquote> <p>I replied:</p> <blockquote> <p>Yes, it would be good to have that confirmed one way or other.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then Pile replied:</p> <blockquote> <p>Facts, figures, and the such like. (Except, as an independent researcher I'm not involved in campaigning). Exactly the same sort of thing that any junior researcher provides to any politician for the same amount of money. Actually, Brussels-based political researchers (for all parties) get paid a lot more, such are the benefits of working in the EU. What's your interest here?</p> </blockquote> <p>I then replied to Pile and Towler:</p> <blockquote> <p>Thanks for the extra info. At the moment, I'm just at the \"curious\" stage, having seen that listing on Godfrey Bloom's register. But I will come back to you if I have any more queries.</p> </blockquote> <p>(I also asked Towler to explain who the \"religious and confidential\" researcher was, how much they were paid, and what precisely they did. He said it was someone called Father Eric Richards who \"does lots of interfaith work\". Beyond that he didn't know, especially regarding the reference to \"confidential\". I also asked Towler to confirm if that Eric Richards was the same Eric Richards listed as the treasurer of the <a href=\"http://www.eurfreedom.org/site-page/board\">European Foundation for Freedom</a>? But I didn't get a response.)</p> <p>But then I started thinking more about that \u00a32,000-a-month figure quoted to me by Pile. On reflection, it seemed like a rather large sum, especially given that Bloom is not the party's spokesperson for this subject. (The median salary in the UK for a full-time worker in 2011 was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2011/nov/23/uk-household-earnings-fall\">\u00a326,244</a>.) I looked at Bloom's website to see what activity within the topics of \"climate and environment\" he'd had pursued since 2009. I found a handful of amateurish YouTube videos (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q862zZYNzVo&amp;feature=plcp\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbNd045fA1E&amp;feature=plcp\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM1WTRqdEkg&amp;feature=plcp\">here</a>) from around the time of the Copenhagen summit in late 2009 with Bloom attacking climate science, but nothing that he couldn't easily have filmed himself and uploaded. He has, on occasion, <a href=\"http://blog.godfreybloommep.co.uk/\">posted on his blog</a> about climate change, carbon \"scammers\", wind farms and the like. There was the <a href=\"http://blog.godfreybloommep.co.uk/index.php/debates-a-speeches\">odd outburst or speech</a> in the European parliament, but again, nothing that seemed to justify a researcher being paid such sums on a monthly basis. And, to further confuse matters, there seemed to be a noticeable reduction in proclamations by Bloom on climate or environmental issues from early 2010 onwards \u2013 just at the time when Pile said he was paid more by Bloom.</p> <p>So I emailed Pile again:</p> <blockquote> <p>Ben, actually maybe you can help me with something. I'm struggling to see what Godfrey Bloom has done re: climate/environment beyond a few (old) Youtube videos around Copenhagen conf period that are on his website and a couple of equally old speeches in parliament. He says he is a \"substitute member on the Environment Committee\". Materially, what does that involve week to week? Can you spell out precisely what he/you have done since early 2010 that would explain the \u00a32k a month fee you mentioned as his researcher on this topic?</p> </blockquote> <p>He then replied to me and Towler:</p> <blockquote> <p>Leo. Sorry, I don't have time to retrace 33 months of my activity for you, nor do I need to justify my pay to you.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, that was that. But then a quick Google search threw up some more intrigue. Documents submitted last May by Ukip to a <a href=\"http://www.northdevon.gov.uk/index/lgcl_planning/lgcl_planning_applications/nonlgcl_devon_wind_farm_appeals_timetable.htm\">public inquiry held by North Devon Council</a> into the building of a wind farm at Batsworthy Cross showed that Pile had appeared \"on behalf\" of Ukip. The documents (<a href=\"http://www.northdevon.gov.uk/43272_apsn_poe_pile_ukip_environment.pdf\">pdf</a>) introduced Pile:</p> <blockquote> <p>Ben Pile is an independent researcher and writer. He is contracted to provide research for the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group in the European Parliament on climate and energy matters. He appears on behalf of Godfrey Bloom MEP and Paul Nuttall MEP, who are member/substitute member respectively of the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Food Safety and Public Health. He has a BA in Politics and Philosophy from the University of York.</p> </blockquote> <p>This threw up even more questions. Why was Pile \"appearing on behalf\" of Bloom and Nuttall? Why were Bloom and Nuttall getting involved in this local planning issue, when neither of them represent north Devon? Does Pile work for Bloom, or for the EFD? Are MEP researchers allowed to get involved in local party issues in this way?</p> <p>I decided to contact the European parliament to check what the precise rules were governing MEP researchers. I would like to say that this cleared the fog, but it didn't.</p> <p>After much asking around, I finally located the officials who oversaw the rules governing the use of, and payment of, researchers by MEPs. The issue was deemed sensitive enough that I was offered only an off-the-record briefing, which, in itself, seemed somewhat ludicrous given how simple my questions were.</p> <p>Either way, I was pointed towards the \"<a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:159:0001:01:EN:HTML\">rules</a>\" governing MEP assistants:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Chapter 5, Article 33</em><br>Defrayal of parliamentary assistance expenses<br>1. Members shall be entitled to assistance from personal staff whom they may freely choose. Parliament shall defray expenses actually incurred and arising wholly and exclusively from the employment of one or more assistants or the use of service providers in accordance with these implementing measures and the conditions laid down by the Bureau.<br>2. Only expenses for assistance which is necessary and directly linked to the exercise of a Member's parliamentary mandate may be defrayed. Expenses linked to a Member's private life may on no account be defrayed.<br>3. Expenses shall be defrayable for the duration of a Member's term of office.<br>4. The maximum monthly amount defrayable in respect of all the personal staff referred to in Article 34 shall be EUR 17,540.</p> </blockquote> <p>Separately, I was directed to the rules governing how political groups receive funding directly from the parliamentary budget (the so-called \"appropriations from budget 400\") which cover the \"administrative and operational expenditure of the political groups/ non-attached member's secretariat\". I was told such funding cannot be used for:</p> <blockquote> <p>* expenditure already covered by other items under the EP budget<br>* financing of any form of European, national, regional or local electoral campaign;<br>* acquisition of immovable property;<br>* financing political parties at European level<br>* acquisition of financial participation or ownership in any other organisation.</p> </blockquote> <p>I then asked who I needed to check with to see whether the use and payment of Pile fell within all these rules. I was told: \"In principle, it would be for the financial services of Parliament and ultimately OLAF [<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/\">the European anti-fraud office</a>] and national authorities to establish that.\"</p> <p>I didn't see that it was necessary to escalate it to that level. I just wanted a simple steer on whether this was all within the rules or not as they seem so open to interpretation. After some more back and forth, I was directed to put my questions to the secretary-general of the EFD Group, as they were the ones signing off Bloom's researcher payments. That struck me as a somewhat biased source for guidance, given that EFD are, in part, one of the parties I'm actually seeking answers about, but I duly sent off an email on 10 October. In particular, I asked:</p> <blockquote> <p>Is such a representation [at the north Devon inquiry] within the rules of an MEP's researcher? Does Mr Pile's activities fall within Chapter 5 of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, as well as the rules on the use of appropriations from budget item 400? As secretary general of the EFD Group, please can you explain your group's rules and procedures for policing the activities and payments to MEP's staff. What is your own understanding of how Mr Bloom justifies paying Mr Pile \u00a32,000 a month? Please can you investigate this matter for me?</p> </blockquote> <p>The following day I received an email from Lynda Roughley, Godfrey Bloom's <a href=\"http://www.godfreybloommep.co.uk/staff.htm\">personal press officer</a>, who had presumably been forwarded my request by EFD:</p> <blockquote> <p>Mr Piles (sic) is legitimately employed as a service provider to Godfrey Bloom, who is happy with the great work he does. Mr Piles represented Mr Bloom at the public meeting in Devon regarding wind farms as unfortunately Mr Bloom was unable to attend.</p> </blockquote> <p>A few minutes later she emailed a \"further comment for clarification\":</p> <blockquote> <p>Mr Piles is not employed as a parliamentary assistant, nor is he employed by the EFD Group.</p> </blockquote> <p>As before, this seemed to raise more questions than it answered. I replied:</p> <blockquote> <p>So who is paying Mr Pile for his contracted work? Mr Bloom out of his own personal pocket? What has happened in the two weeks since Mr Pile emailed me? Has his contract work been terminated? Or is there some other explanation? Why was Mr Bloom planning to attend this local public hearing in Devon, when that is not within his MEP constituency of Yorkshire and the Humber?</p> </blockquote> <p>I received no response. I asked again the following day, but also received no response.</p> <p>(N.B. In the past week, Pile has released a <a href=\"http://www.losthorizons.org/\">new anti-wind video</a> that he \"produced and directed\". It is described in the end titles as a \"Polimedia Production for EFD\" and the credits \"give thanks\" to, among others, Godfrey Bloom. It is \"written and presented\" by Steve Crowther, Ukip's chairman and the person who called Pile to appear at the North Devon public inquiry \"on behalf\" of Bloom.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, I had asked the press spokesman for the <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/envi/home.html\">EU parliament's environment committee</a> what involvement Bloom had as a \"substitute member\". Perhaps this could help explain the sums being paid each month to Pile if this provided Bloom with a heavy workload? The spokesman responded:</p> <blockquote> <p>I've been working for the environment committee the last 2 and a half years. I don't recall ever seeing him at a committee meeting debate or vote in that time. He has also not been a rapporteur or shadow rapporteur for any environment committee files as far as I know. (The committee appoints a \"rapporteur\" - aka draftsman - for each piece of draft legislation and the different political groupings appoint a 'shadow' to negotiate amendments to the texts.)<br> <br>The distinction between a member and substitute member isn't always very clear. There are MEPs who are have full \"member\" status on a committee but are basically inactive (e.g. because they are fully devoted elsewhere). There are MEPs who are \"substitutes\" but very active. So for a fuller picture you might find it helpful to check what Mr Bloom's activities are across the committees he sits on as a member (economic affairs and women's rights).<br> <br>From <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28513/Godfrey_BLOOM.html\">his profile page</a>, there are links to his \"parliamentary activities\":</p> </blockquote> <p>I looked at that link \u2013 and on <a href=\"http://www.votewatch.eu/en/godfrey-bloom.html\">this link</a> which shows his voting record \u2013 and I still can't see how his parliamentary activity justifies a dedicated climate and environment researcher, let alone one paid such sums.<br> <br>As one last throw of the dice, I contacted <a href=\"http://www.newton-dunn.com/\">Bill Newton Dunn</a>, the Liberal Democrat MEP who was, until recently, one of the EU parliament's five elected \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaestor_%28European_Parliament%29\">quaestors</a>\" \u2013 MEPs who are \"responsible for administrative and financial matters directly concerning members\". He recommended I contact <a href=\"http://www.jimhiggins.ie/ep/\">Jim Higgins</a>, the Irish MEP who was recently elected to the role of quaestor. But three weeks later - after an email, a follow-up email, and several phone-calls to his office in Brussels - I have heard nothing other than a confirmation from his staff that Higgins had received my original email. Yet again, it's like wringing water from a stone.</p> <p>I feel that neither Ukip, the EFD, or even the European parliament, have displayed the transparency you might hope for when faced with a seemingly simple question about how they are spending taxpayers' money. And I have only looked at this one case because it happened to catch my eye. There are 754 MEPs, all of whom, it seems, are entitled to spend Euros 17,540 a month (?!) on \"personal staff\", including researchers. Just don't ask any questions about how that money is actually being spent\u2026</p>",
  "<p><em>Ayuda en Accion</em> \u2013 Spain's version of ActionAid \u2013 was an incongruous participant at a gathering of social media last week in Seville, <a href=\"http://eventoblog.com/\" title=\"\">EBE12</a>.</p> <p>Now in its seventh year, EBE attracts bloggers and technology experts who network and swap ideas on the latest trends. Most participants were in their 20s, many carrying tablets and laptops \u2013 notepads and pens were a rarity. Mitchell Baker, chair of the <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/\" title=\"\">Mozilla Foundation</a> \u2013 which promotes openness on the web \u2013 was one of the big draws at this year's event, which ended on a sodden Sunday amid unseasonable sheets of rain. So EBE is not the usual venue for a development NGO.</p> <p><em>Ayuda en Accion</em>, however, is looking at ways to connect sponsors and beneficiaries in Latin America. It boils down to necessity being the mother of invention. The number of <em>Ayuda en Accion</em>'s sponsors has been falling in recent years and the NGO hopes to use social media to reverse the trend.</p> <p>The first blow came in 2007, when two Spanish charities were accused of fraud, sapping confidence in NGOs. Support for the voluntary sector was hit as some people withdrew donations. The 2008 financial crisis followed, hitting Spain, Greece and Portugal particularly hard. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/apr/04/value-oecd-aid-drops-15-years\" title=\"\">Spain's official development assistance last year fell by 32.7% to $4,264m</a>, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p> <p><em>Ayuda en Accion, </em>which works mainly in Latin America, has seen its sponsors plummet to 130,000 from 180,000 in the past five years. Sponsors typically donate \u20ac20 a month to projects in education and health, for example. The formula is a familiar one. A sponsor sends money to a charity. In return he or she receives a couple of updates a year, including a Christmas message. These messages attempt to provide a personal \u2013 albeit contrived \u2013 connection between sponsor and beneficiary. <em>Ayuda en Accion</em>'s efforts to revitalise the formula represents in microcosm the difficulties of NGOs in this economic climate.</p> <p>A pilot scheme, <a href=\"http://vidasendirecto.ayudaenaccion.org/\" title=\"\">Vidas en Directo</a> (Lives live), seeks to make that connection more immediate and personal, as well as conveying the impact of sponsorship. A deepening in the relationship, <em>Ayuda en Accion</em> hopes, will reverse the trend in declining sponsorships. The pilot involves training communities to communicate with their sponsors through a weekly blog. <em>Ayuda en Accion</em> has picked five communities, four in Honduras and one in Bolivia, where groups of young people have been posting occasional entries for the past six months.</p> <p>\"We want people to communicate directly without intermediaries,\" says Esther Alonso, head of organisation and projects. \"That improves accountability, brings more transparency, works on their technical capacities and empowers them.\"</p> <p>There is filtering though, as <em>Ayuda en Accion</em> in Madrid will cast an eye on the posts first, to see whether they could be improved and to iron out or nip in the bud any conflicts. \"We will try to understand the conflict first,\" Alonso says. \"Sometimes it's a question of jealousy among beneficiaries as to why a person is receiving help instead of another. When it has been serious we have had to travel there to find out what is really going on.\"</p> <p>The bloggers live in rural areas without internet connection or computers, and have to travel to <em>Ayuda en Accion</em>'s local partner in Honduras, CDH, to send their comments. As with any new scheme, there have been teething problems.</p> <p>Lovingly produced training materials were less than useful because of technical jargon. Even being able to turn on a computer could not be taken for granted as some people had never seen a computer before. The pilot scheme is being tried out with communities who have been involved with <em>Ayuda en Accion</em> for at least three years, as project startups are complicated enough.</p> <p>The initial aim for the blogs \u2013 one each for the five communities \u2013 is to provide feedback for the sponsors who will be able to read the posts. \"We want to say to sponsors: 'Here is your window into these projects, you can look through it in real time,'\" says Alonso. \"Some sponsors may not be interested but we hope they are and will get involved.\"</p> <p>In a second phase, she says, those sponsors who are keen will be given usernames and passwords so they can write about their own lives. \"We want to close the circle, so sponsors can write back,\" says Alonso.</p> <p>Each project has about 3,000 sponsors, so the first job is to find out how many have an interest in \"closing the circle\". A smaller-scale version of <em>Vidas en Directo</em> shows some promise. It involves 200 businesswomen in Spain and 90-100 in Ecuador swapping information with each other via a blog. It is this experimentation with new media that drew <em>Ayuda en Accion</em> to Seville to mingle at EBE12 as it seeks ways of reinvigorating the sponsorship formula.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Mark Tran was invited to speak at EBE12 about the Guardian's Global development site by Ayuda en Accion, which paid for transport and accommodation</em></p>",
  "<p>Reducing waste and reusing resources could help drive the UK's economic recovery as well as benefit the environment, a conference was told on Tuesday.</p> <p>The chief executive of the government's waste advisory body, <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Wrap</a>, told senior business leaders, policymakers and local authority managers that efficient use of resources is critical to the UK's future economic competitiveness and resilience.</p> <p>Opening a debate on the economic benefits of what has been dubbed the \"circular economy\", Liz Goodwin said: \"Realising the full value of materials through resource management could drive sustainable growth, with <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCwQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mckinsey.com%2Ffeatures%2F~%2Fmedia%2Fmckinsey%2Fdotcom%2Fhomepage%2F2011%2520nov%2520resource%2520revolution%2Fresource_revolution_full_report_v2.ashx&amp;ei=fuOYUJDsOcWIhQfaj4GQBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEUfqBr7xeKPAdl6v9r7AuSwapkRQ\" title=\"\">a recent McKinsey report</a> showing 30% of global demand for resources in 2030 could be met through improved management. Resulting global economic benefits could be as high as $3.7 trillion a year.\"</p> <p>Recent research from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) showed that UK businesses consume 600m tonnes of materials a year. Around one-third of this ends up as waste, and much of it could have been used productively with benefits of up to \u00a318bn.</p> <p>A major part of Wrap's role is to help business achieve these benefits which, if re-invested, would help drive economic growth, Goodwin said, pointing to further factors currently holding back investment: \"In a recent survey 80% of CEOs of manufacturing companies said raw material shortage was a risk to their business. A 147% surge in real commodity prices since 2000, and the uncertainty being caused by historically high levels of price volatility are hampering investment and economic growth.\"</p> <p>Examples of the circular economy include the \"closed loop\" system now used for turning old plastic bottles into new ones. But there remain many challenges, Goodwin admitted, not least in the electricals and electronics supply chain.</p> <p>Other speakers at the conference were Mike Barry, head of sustainable business at Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/07/marks-spencer-carbon-neutral-sustainability\" title=\"\">earlier this year claimed to have become the first UK retailer to become \"carbon neutral\"</a> and Lord de Mauley from Defra, the is resource management minister.</p>",
  "<p>Most small to medium sized business owners know the frustration of spending more time than they want on non-revenue generating activities. From payroll and human resource management to benefits and compensation, managers and directors can spend a significant proportion of their day engaged in these necessary but time consuming tasks.</p> <p>The answer for many businesses may be to outsource part or all of their HR functions to third party providers so that they can focus on their core business.</p> <p>Generally speaking, the top three reasons cited for outsourcing HR are access to skills and knowledge, gaining better quality support than the business is able to be offer in-house and the costs saved. This saving comes from the company either not requiring an HR person in-house, or enabling the person who had taken on the HR function to focus on revenue generating work. I've found the most commonly outsourced HR activities are legal services, payroll and pensions.</p> <p>But when does it make sense for you to outsource? In assessing whether you should or not, there are several questions to consider before you make a decision.</p> <p><strong>How big is your company? </strong></p> <p>In my experience, businesses with fewer than 50 employees rarely have an HR team. Instead they may have a manager or finance director who dabbles in HR because they have some relevant experience in their dim and distant past which seemingly qualifies them to deal with all the people issues that arise. As a rule of thumb, organisations with more than 50 employees will often find it easier to have an in-house HR department and therefore, though they may still require outsourced HR support, the nature of that service may differ greatly from that utilised by the smaller business.</p> <p><strong>What services do you need? </strong></p> <p>The nature of the work undertaken by an outsourced HR consultant varies hugely dependent on the nature of the business and the talents of the employees within the organisation. With regard to my practice, I work for organisations with no HR department ensuring the business meets all necessary legal requirements in terms of policies and contracts. In addition, I deal with \u2013 or support the relevant people within the business who are dealing with \u2013 any employee relations issues as they arise including discrimination claims, redundancy, grievances and dismissals. I also provide regular newsletters on topical and relevant issues to ensure my clients remain current and up to date. I also work for businesses which do employ an HR team \u2013 I may be called in to support that team when issues arise that require legal advice.</p> <p><strong>How much does an outsourced service cost? </strong></p> <p>It is important to establish up front the way in which the outsourced service is billed. By and large, the cost of the service varies depending on the level of outsourcing that is required. For example, I may be asked to assist on a specific well-defined project in which case I will estimate the cost involved, or at least offer a range of costs within which it will fall. Alternatively, I may work alongside the business dealing with day-to-day issues on a retained basis, or, I may be called in to sort an \"emergency\" for which I charge an hourly rate.</p> <p><strong>What type of provider do you want?</strong></p> <p>Do you want a \"face\" who gets to know your business, staff and culture, who can be flexible in the service you offer and who, by virtue of being a phone call away, can operate as if you have your very own HR department? Alternatively, you may sign up to a HR support line \u2013 a less personal service but one that may suit the nature of your business and complement the expertise you already have within your organisation. The type of service I offer falls into the former example but it is \"horses for courses\" and the latter may be suitable where there is an experienced HR team who just need reassurance from time to time.</p> <p>I would say that as a general rule of thumb, when administrative processes begin slowing down the productivity of the firm is the time to consider outsourcing the management of your human resources. Good employee relations are not simply \"nice to have\" but important to get right as they can directly affect the future revenues of your business.</p> <p>By prioritising employee engagement you will ensure you are not burdened by high employee turnover, low morale or ineffective teamwork. Instead you will have employees who are productive, enthusiastic and effective, enabling you to maintain an edge in a highly competitive environment. The attraction and retention of talent is now such a business critical operation that for many businesses, outsourcing their HR function is the best way to ensure that what is arguably their most valuable asset is well managed, freeing them up to concentrate on their core business.<br><em><br>Nicola Goodridge is a HR consultant and owner of <a href=\"http://www.goodhr.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Good HR</a><br></em><br><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>When Dave Clarke is on holiday his out of office auto-reply suggests you \"contact other staff in the Bugs section\"; he spends at least some of his day handling tarantulas and other hairy-legged arachnids; and he shares his office with two tanks of snails. His job as head of invertebrates at <a href=\"http://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo/\" title=\"London Zoo website\">London Zoo</a> is definitely not for those who squirm at the site of creepy crawlies.</p> <p>Clarke's climate-controlled office is covered in maps showing where certain species of animal are at risk. It's a topic he feels strongly about having been on numerous overseas expeditions to capture animals under threat of extinction.</p> <p>As well as the plan to save the currently office-based <a href=\"http://www.zsl.org/conservation/regions/americas/snail-wars-in-the-pacific,45,AR.html\" title=\"London Zoo: Polynesian Partula Snail\">Polynesian Partula snail</a>, Clarke helped prevent the extinction of the British field cricket. \"We were down to the last three pairs left in the wild and bred them to adult age before releasing them,\" he says. \"It doesn't get any better than that.\"</p> <p>While he had wanted to be a zoo keeper for as long as he can remember, there were no zoos near where he grew up in which to gain experience, so he settled for the next best thing \u2013 working in a pet shop.</p> <p>He worked his way up to under-manager of the aquarium, but alongside caring for animals he learned something far more important: how to interact with people. \"I was painfully shy until I started working with a colleague in the pet shop who had a brilliant patter,\" Clarke says. \"He really helped me to socailise.\"</p> <p>His next job was as a trainee keeper at Drusillas Zoo in Alfriston, where he looked after a wide range of species including servals and meerkats. At the same time he joined the Association of British and Irish Wild Animal Keepers and went to every regional meeting it held, meeting everyone important in the zoo business.</p> <p>Clarke's networking eventually paid off in 1984 when he heard about an opening for a temporary keeper at London Zoo. \"I worked in the small mammal house for three months, and then a job in the insect house came up,\" he says. \"I thought it would be interesting because there were lots of young, dynamic people in that area.\" Despite being \"nervous of spiders\" Clarke says the insect house offered \"more challenging species, more interesting exhibits and more breeding of species.\"</p> <p>Clarke and his colleagues successfully campaigned for National Lottery money to rebuild the insect house in 1999. Now called <a href=\"http://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo/exhibits/bugs/\" title=\"London Zoo: B.U.G.S\">B.U.G.S</a> (Biodiversity Underpinning Global Survival), Clarke's exhibit looks after more than 140 species including black widow spiders, tarantulas, giant orb spiders and leaf cutter ants. While the vast majority of animals in his care are invertebrates, Clarke also looks after a few monkeys, naked molerats, fish, birds and reptiles, as well as the zoo's anteaters and the butterfly exhibit.</p> <p>Leading a team of eight keepers means much of his time is spent managing people, filing reports and doing other necessary admin, which drags him away from the breeding room and the zoo keeping he calls the \"best part\" of his role. But he still gets close to his animals on a daily basis and occasionally hosts the \"Spider Talk\" and \"Megabugs\" events.</p> <p>I watch Clarke give the 3.00pm Spider Talk and witness children and adults alike marvel as he extracts a red-kneed tarantula from a plastic tub, using his hands as a pincer to lift it out before placing it on one palm. It remains still while he patiently explains to excitable children that the spider won't hurt them (their first question is usually \"Can it kill me?\").</p> <p>Clarke got his job through work experience and persistence, but he says it's much harder for young people wishing to get into zoo keeping today. \"These days you'll need a degree, probably in one of the sciences, and you'll need to show some practical experience too, such as working in a pet shop or volunteering at a local zoo. There's a lot of competition because zoo keeping is one of those jobs that children want to do when they grow up, like being an astronaut.\"</p>",
  "<p>House prices fell for the fourth month running in October, dropping by 0.7% over the month, according to the latest figures from mortgage lender Halifax.</p> <p>The bank's latest house price index put the average cost of a home in the UK at \u00a3158,426, down \u00a34,500 on the price in October 2011 and \u00a341,000 lower than the peak of \u00a3199,612 in August 2007.</p> <p>According to the index, which calculates annual price changes using the average of three months' figures, values have fallen by 1.7% over the past 12 months \u2013 the highest annual change recorded since February.</p> <p>The three-month figures, which are generally a better indication of price trends than single monthly figures, showed a 1.2% fall. This is substantially higher than the 0.5% figure recorded in September.</p> <p>Halifax's chief economist, Martin Ellis, said the figures were \"signs of a modest deterioration in the trend in house prices\".</p> <p>He added: \"The weak economic background has been a key factor dampening housing demand this year. Recent encouraging developments relating to the level of overall economic activity and conditions in the labour market, however, may help to support demand and underpin house prices around current levels over the coming months.\"</p> <p>The short-term figures, which are based on mortgages approved by the bank, contradict the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/nov/01/uk-house-prices-rise-slightly\" title=\"UK house prices rebound 0.6% after 0.4% fall last month\">most recent index from rival lender Nationwide</a>.

  "<p>Retail sales may have dipped last month and the high street bloodbath may have seen off the likes of JJB and Comet, but discount clothing group Primark goes from strength to strength.</p> <p>The chain's parent <strong>Associated British Foods</strong> said Primark's profits had jumped 15% last year to \u00a3356m on revenues up a similar amount to \u00a33.5bn. Margins held steady at 10.2% despite cost pressures from rises in the price of raw materials such as cotton. Primark's brand of the latest fashions at bargain prices has seen it thrive when others falter.</p> <p>It opened 19 new stores including one at the other end of London's Oxford Street to its flagship Marble Arch outlet, and one on Princes Street in Edinburgh. It has also expanded abroad including in 11 in Iberia and five in northern Europe.</p> <p>Overall, ABF's revenues rose 11% to \u00a312.3bn, with profit before tax up 17% to \u00a3974m. Its sugar business grew strongly, especially in Europe while Twinings, Ryvita and Silver Spoon all lifted the grocery business, although the division was held back by restructuring charges as it cut costs in Australia and at Allied Bakeries. Chief executive George Weston said:</p> <blockquote> These are very good results for the group and include exceptional performances from AB Sugar and Primark. Global economic uncertainty remains but we have opportunities for further investment and the strength of the group balance sheet and a strong cash flow will enable us to pursue them with confidence. </blockquote> <p>More specifically, the company said it expected a reduction in profit from AB Sugar due to lower EU production, but this would be more than offset by further growth at Primark and some recovery in the grocery business. The note of caution has helped push the company's shares 7p lower to \u00a313.59. In a hold note Martin Deboo of Investec said:</p> <blockquote> The shares have run strongly into the event against which management are guiding to first half-weighted 'progress' in 2013. Against this consensus is looking for 8% earnings per share growth and us 5%, reflecting some caution on sugars which is echoed in the outlook statement. </blockquote> <p>But Panmure Gordon raised its target price from \u00a313, with analyst Graham Jones saying:</p> <blockquote> While we expect sugar profits to fall back somewhat from the exceptional levels reached in 2012, we still expect the group to deliver a healthy 5.5% earnings per share growth driven by Primark's continued strong expansion programme and a recovery of profits in grocery. Our sum-of-the-parts valuation now indicates fair value to \u00a314.50. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere the market is moving higher despite the uncertainties of the US election and the continuing worries about Greece, Spain and the other troubled members of the eurozone.

  "<p>HSBC is staying in the UK \u2013 at least until 2015. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/05/hsbc-delays-hq-decision-2015\" title=\"\">Chairman Douglas Flint said on Monday that the bank's current review of where to locate its headquarters has been deferred</a>. There is too much regulatory uncertainty, and too much legislative reform on the slipway, to make a sensible decision before then, argued Flint.</p> <p>Should we rejoice? No. It is better to laugh at HSBC's continuing arrogance in thinking of itself as a model global citizen that would be welcomed wherever it wishes to land. The reality is that, after the money-laundering allegations against the bank in the US and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/05/hsbc-warns-money-laundering-fines\" title=\"\">the looming \u00a31bn-plus penalty</a>, brand HSBC is not what it was. Which regulator would offer an unequivocal embrace to a firm that is clearly so big it is hard to manage and will be watched like a hawk in future by US authorities?</p> <p>Besides, HSBC, which has been based in the UK for a quarter of a century, would have to clear any emigration proposal with its shareholders. There may (currently) be a tax advantage to not being British. But do investors really want to see the bank base itself in Hong Kong, on the doorstep on the Chinese Communist party? Almost certainly not.</p> <p>Given the lack of historical ties, adopting Singapore or Australia would make HSBC look like the wandering bank, which cannot be good for the reputation. That is how here-today-gone-tomorrow hedge funds behave, not top-tier international banks. No, it's London for several decades yet.</p> <p>Instead of pretending that there's a real decision to be made in 2015, Flint would do better to drop these three-yearly reviews into where to locate the HQ. The game of will-they-won't-they has lost both suspense and the power to frighten politicians.</p>",
  "<p>It's easy to become jaundiced about localism, but here's an inspiring story of volunteer achievement from London. Blackheath community library came into being during August 2011, following Lewisham council's decision to close five libraries with a call for communities to come forward to take over their running.</p> <p>Gillian Gadsby, chair of the campaign to save the library, says \"we fought long and hard before we realised that, with the cuts, it was a hopeless case. The village library was in a rented building, unlike the other four, costing Lewisham \u00a375,000 a year which it was no longer prepared to pay\".</p> <p>Blackheath village library had new life breathed into it with support from the charity Age Exchange. A team of 34 volunteers has kept an interim service running six days a week for more than a year. They manage a stock of 6,000 books, a selection of newspapers and magazines, a cafe selling homemade cakes and old fashioned sweets, and a computer hub with Wi-Fi access. The library is now housed in the Bakehouse Theatre, owned by Age Exchange.</p> <p>A massive investment of \u00a3860,000 is funding the revamp of Age Exchange's Blackheath headquarters so that the new community library will have better facilities than ever before. A total of \u00a3500,000 was contributed by a number of city financiers, \u00a3200,000 from Lewisham council and \u00a330,000 from the Blackheath Assembly \u2013 established to give residents a say in local affairs and award grants to local initiatives. Meanwhile, the Blackheath Society (founded 75 years ago to monitor the built environment and green areas in the locality) and Blackheath Village Traders Association have both backed this makeover.</p> <p>The idea of a 'one stop shop' or community hub has a long and honourable history. Researcher Malcolm Moseley <a href=\"http://www.rsnonline.org.uk/phocadownload/moseley-colocationpaper.pdf\" title=\"\">published a paper in 2004</a> on \"the co-location of disparate services\", which looked at village halls doubling as post offices, garages housing the local shop, and community centres used as a base by the police and local authority staff.</p> <p>The new Blackheath facility is set to open on 22 November and volunteers will be trained to undertake their various responsibilities. This is big Dave's 'big society' in action but it also illustrates that, regardless of the localism agenda, communities can and do go quietly about their business of improving society without any official approval, funding or fanfare.</p> <p>The downside of this wonderful civic action is biblical in proportion and explanation: the renewed government emphasis on volunteerism carries real dangers that \"for he that hath, to him shall be given; and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath\". In other words for every place like Blackheath there are as many others that lack the social capital, the local movers and shakers, the volunteers with deep pockets and the spare time to dedicate to voluntary work.</p> <p>My fear is that localism will not overcome but rather widen the gap between DIY communities and the rest. This is particularly worrying given the recent news that Lewisham is set to make a <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=107338\" title=\"\">further \u00a328m in cuts</a>. Mayor Sir Steve Bullock claims that cuts are needed because the government has decided to single out local government to carry the burden of reducing the deficit.</p> <p>Those in Blackheath say they are pleased they have preserved a good library run by interested and willing volunteers, but remain angry at a government that has allowed libraries to close and care little for literacy. This is, as I term it, the 'localist's lament'.</p> <p><em>James Derounian is principal lecturer in community development and local governance at the </em><a href=\"http://www.glos.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>University of Gloucestershire</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/local-government/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and the latest vacancies in your area</strong></p>",
  "<p>As gutsy New Yorkers begin the task of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/new-york-sandy-superstorm-clean?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">drying out the city</a>, here's one thought that occurred to me last night watching the horrifying pictures from a distance. It's obviously not crucial right now \u2013 but in the long run it might make a difference. Why don't we stop naming these storms for people, and start naming them after oil companies?</p> <p>Global warming didn't \"cause\" the hurricane, of course \u2013 hurricanes are caused when a tropical wave washes off the coast of Africa and begins to spin in the far Atlantic. But this storm rode ocean waters five degrees warmer than normal, so it's no great shock that it turned into a monster. By the time it hit land, it had smashed every record for the lowest barometric pressure and the largest wind field.</p> <p>Most of its damage, of course, came from the savage storm surge, washing over <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockaway,_Queens\" title=\"\">the Rockaway</a>, into <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland_Tunnel\" title=\"\">Holland Tunnel</a>. It was astonishing to watch on TV as the Lower East Side became a part of the East River. And one reason that surge was so high? The sea level in New York harbour has gone up a foot as the climate has warmed. Sandy had a big head start on flooding out the city.</p> <p>The fossil fuel companies have played the biggest role in making sure we don't slow global warming down. They've <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/global-warming-and-energy/polluterwatch/koch-industries/\" title=\"\">funded climate denial propagandists</a> and helped pack Congress with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/03/republican-climate-sceptics-reelection-backlash\" title=\"\">anti-environmental extremists</a>, making sure that commonsense steps to move toward renewable energy never happen. So maybe it's only right that we should honour their efforts by naming storms for them from now on. At the very least it's fun to imagine the newscasters announcing, \"Exxon is coming ashore across New Jersey, leaving havoc in her wake\", or \"Chevron forces evacuation of 375,000\".</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.350.org/\" title=\"\">350.org</a>, the climate change campaign that I helped found, we're sending out an appeal to our worldwide mailing list today. It asks two things: that people send money to the <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org/\" title=\"\">Red Cross</a> to help with relief efforts along the Atlantic seaboard, and that they send a message to the oil companies asking them to stop funding election campaigns and use the money for recovery efforts instead.</p> <p>That would help clear the air in DC, and it would also help New York: Chevron, for instance, donated $2.5m (\u00a31.6m) to a <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/10/26/1094541/chevron-election-republicans/\" title=\"\">GOP super-Pac</a> last week, the largest single corporate donation since the supreme court cleared the way for such influence-buying. In the face of this tragedy, it would be the very least they could do, a tiny start toward repairing the damage they've caused. For a decade, anyone named Sandy is going to have to endure hurricane jokes. Seems much fairer to pin the blame where it belongs.</p> <p>This article first appeared on the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/\" title=\"\">Daily News website</a></p>",
  "<p>Nowhere is the increasingly fragmented nature of today's legal profession more evident than when considering the issue of pro bono \u2013 free legal services delivered by lawyers. From City lawyers working with NGOs on international aid projects in the third world, to running workshops on judicial independence in Albania through to beleaguered legal aid lawyers in Bolton helping the client who otherwise would not be able to secure \"access to justice\".</p> <p>It is National Pro Bono week \u2013 for a brief time lawyers put aside their usual reserve and bang the drum for all the good work they do for charity. And, to be fair, lawyers' commitment to volunteering is hugely impressive.</p> <p>A few snapshots from the incredibly broad spectrum of pro bono activity over the last 12 months include: the <a href=\"http://www.thefru.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Free Representation Unit</a>, a charity which helps people who cannot afford representation at employment and social security tribunals, fielded 532 volunteers to act for over 1,000 clients which they reckon is the equivalent of 24,500 hours of pro bono help; LawWorks, the pro bono clearing house, placed around half of 532 applications for legal help from community groups and a further 92 individual cases; and the City firm, Hogan Lovells claims to have dedicated some 104,047 total pro bono hours. For a more comprehensive overview of the state of pro bono, then check out the <a href=\"http://www.atjf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Pro Bono Yearbook of England and Wales</a>.</p> <p>The LawWorks pro bono survey \u2013 also out Tuesday \u2013 reflects the polarisation between City and high street in their relationship to the profession's voluntary activities. It draws on responses from 118 legal practices, mainly from the high street (39%) and international (22%) firms.</p> <p>Pro bono in City firms has become mainstreamed and so, for example, nearly all (95%) of respondents with more than 250 lawyers have a pro bono policy in place compared to less than one in three high street firms (32%). Most legal practices do not have a dedicated pro bono budget (71% of all respondents) however almost three-quarters (73%) of international firms do.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, given the economic climate, some of the larger firms are reporting a significant reduction in the number of hours they did globally in 2010 compared to 2011 \u2013 for example, <a href=\"http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/features/pro-bono-minding-gap\" title=\"\">Clifford Chance and Hogan Lovells (HL) are down 9% and 15% respectively</a>. Despite this, it is still a massive commitment - four out of 10 of HL's London lawyers are involved in pro bono activity.</p> <p>This split in attitude towards the voluntary endeavour of the legal profession is only likely to be further heightened by the challenging environment for law firms: increasing competition on the high street as a result of the Legal Services Act reforms, the brutal legal aid cuts coming in next year, and of course the longest double-dip recession since the second world war.</p> <p>The old pro bono line (\"pro bono is an adjunct to, not a substitute for legal aid ...\") has served as a useful reminder to warn ministers of their obligation to secure access to justice to those who otherwise couldn't afford it. But evidently such a consideration was a non-issue for the coalition government. The LASPO (<a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/legislation/bills-and-acts/acts/legal-aid-and-sentencing-act/laspo-background-information\" title=\"\">Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act</a>) cuts are predicated on one idea - to effectively filet our system of publicly-funded law by cutting \u00a3350m from a \u00a32.2bn scheme. But, perhaps, the \"adjunct to\" formula needs to be revisited post-LASPO.</p> <p>I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/10/law-centres-need-solicitors-cash\" title=\"\">recently blogged</a> about the proposal of Paul im Thurn, senior solicitor at Cumbria Law Centre and co-chair of the Law Centre Federation, for adding \u00a325 to the solicitors' practicing certificate to fund law centres. The value of im Thurn's idea (it seemed to me) was two fold: firstly, to make sure those advice agencies stayed afloat to keep on helping those clients who so desperately need their help and, secondly, to highlight the government's shocking abdication of that responsibility. It seems that a coordinated and imaginative response by the pro bono movement to LASPO could highlight the failure of this government.</p> <p>Two years ago as part of the JusticeGap series, we published a collection of essays called <a href=\"http://thejusticegap.com/justicegapseries/wrongly-accused/\" title=\"\">Pro Bono: good enough?</a> with the rather unwieldy sub-heading \"The uneasy relationship between volunteer legal activity and access to justice\". One contributor Neil Kinsella, chief executive of Russell Jones &amp;Walker (now part of Slater &amp; Gordon) invoked legal aid's origins:</p> <p>As the Attlee government never set up a National Legal Service to match the NHS, society has \"always had to rely on the profession to help ensure access to justice\". If pro bono is \"fundamental to access to justice\", then it needs to be delivered in a more strategic and organised way, he argued.</p> <p>There were similar calls for some City firms in favour of a more strategic approach. \"Our default obligation is its 'access to justice for the poor' and above all else, our pro bono programs are about social welfare law support,\" Clifford Chance's then pro bono partner Michael Smyth said.</p> <p>If that debate about that \"uneasy relationship\" seemed timely then, how much more urgent does it seem now in the countdown to the April 2013 implementation of the LASPO cuts?</p> <p>It doesn't look likely to happen any time soon. Back to the LawWorks survey - the vast majority of firms (78%) have made no plans as part of their pro bono activity to respond to the legal aid cuts \u2013 apparently, high street firms were \"the least likely\" to be prepared to offer pro bono services to help those no longer eligible for legal aid. The report noted, \"widespread concern about the impact of LASPO but almost no planning or appetite for moving into new areas of pro bono work to fill the gaps\".</p> <p>J<em>on Robins is editor of </em><a href=\"http://thejusticegap.com/\" title=\"\"><em>thejusticegap.com</em></a><em> and is honorary editor of the Pro Bono Yearbook of England and Wales 2012</em></p>",
  "<p>The aid concept is outdated and it's time to take a fresh look at the way the world envisages it. What if we were to pool the public funds available for international finance and split them according to global priorities?</p> <p>Every year, more countries enter the aid arena \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.trend.az/news/politics/2082180.html\" title=\"\">Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan are the latest and perhaps most surprising countries</a> to have begun to talk about becoming donors, albeit with very limited funds to begin with. Meanwhile, the development sector's vision is evolving from a tight poverty eradication focus to an appreciation of global public goods \u2013 from which everyone benefits and towards which all must contribute \u2013 under a framework of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/may/21/sustainable-development-shape-world-to-come\" title=\"\">sustainable development</a>.</p> <p>The big question becomes how best to split the rising amount of public money (probably about $150bn today) made available for global development.</p> <p>An important conceptual analogy is that what we are talking about is simply public spending at a global level, for global goods, just as there is public spending at a national level for national goods.</p> <p>People accustomed to a traditional aid paradigm can't understand the increasingly common practice of giving aid to countries that have their own aid programmes, (hence the lively debates around <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/nov/08/india-aid-economic-development\" title=\"\">aid to middle-income countries such as India</a>). Aid was meant to be the transfer of funds to cash-strapped nations. But the concept of global public spending can deal with this apparent paradox.</p> <p>Try it out. For every question you have about the future of global development finance, make an analogy with national public spending.</p> <p>Should we focus on poverty or sustainable development? Both, just as we do at a national level.</p> <p>Who should contribute? Everyone. The poorest would contribute less than the rich, but all apart from the very poorest countries would pay, just as all but the very poorest citizens or smallest businesses contribute to national exchequers \u2013 perhaps a flat 1% of national income would suffice. Unlike with aid, there is no contradiction in poor countries paying money towards global goods, and also receiving support for their particular problems.</p> <p>How should global public funds complement private investment? Look at how national public spending is used to incentivise or build a context for progressive investments and you have your answer.</p> <p>The list of analogies could go on. Instead of parks and playgrounds in need of national investment, think oceans and forests in need of global preservation. Just as there is a social safety net at the national level, so at the international level, responses to extremes of poverty would remain a key part of global spending.</p> <p>We already have regional public spending with the EU. This is a clue to what is possible and also, of course, to the problems that will ensue; think the EU's \"democratic deficit\" on a global scale. The further away spending decisions are from the sources of money, the more problematic the system.</p> <p>Opposition to the EU having a large budget is more widespread than opposition to public spending at a national level. Global public spending would face similar challenges of inefficiency and bureaucracy, and there would be even more examples of wasted money. But unless we are prepared to see aid dwindle and the international sphere become the reserve of private funds, this is surely the next step for development co-operation. It would require an evolution of current UN and other institutions, such as the World Bank and regional banks, while bilateral agencies would be part of the democratic link to taxpayers' money.</p> <p>As important as any inevitably fraught architectural decisions is the communications value of this concept \u2013 the general public in all countries, rich, middle-income and poor, should quickly grasp and appreciate the idea of global public spending reversing the antagonism to \"aid\". National public spending is widely accepted \u2013 only the most die-hard anti-statists oppose social safety nets for the poorest people, investment in research for new technologies, conservation, policing and so on. In a globalising world, it is only logical that we take that theory one step further.</p> <p>Just as individual contributions are the price of living in a civilised society, so national contributions to the global pot could be the price of living in a prosperous and sustainable world.</p> <p>The very reason that this vision is hard to achieve is what makes it so progressive and exciting. This way of thinking will only work insofar as human beings are able to internationalise their minds and think on a truly global, horizontal level, the project of progressives for centuries. This is a truly radical perspective, implying a kind of internationalism that is still only developing.</p> <p>That's my take on the future of aid. Other authors, notably Jean-Michel Severino and Olivier Ray, <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1421419/\" title=\"\">appear to be moving in a similar direction</a>.

  "<p>In his role as UN special envoy for global education, Gordon Brown has declared this coming Saturday 10 November 10th a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20045482\">'global day of action'</a> in support of Malala Yousafzai, a month to the day that the 15-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl was attacked by the Taliban, simply for insisting that she go to school. </p> <p>As she recovers in a Birmingham hospital, Brown has urged people to support the estimated 32 million girls worldwide who are denied the right to go to school every day, by marking <strong>Malala Day</strong>. The tribute will coincide with his trip to Pakistan <a href=\"http://educationenvoy.org/\">to deliver a petition</a> containing more than a million signatures, to President Asif Ali Zardari, urging him to make education a reality for all Pakistani children, irrespective of gender. </p> <p>The plans for Malala Day reminded me of the girls that I grew up with, who were also denied their right to learn; the irony is that it happened right here, in the backstreets of inner-city Bradford. Some of these girls I know well since they are my first cousins, British-born Pakistanis just like me. My cousin Aisha comes to mind immediately, since she was around the age that Malala is today when she was permanently removed from school during the early 1980s. She had just reached puberty, you see, which posed a threat to her father, just as Malala's adolescence was a menace to the Taliban.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398883592\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/4/5/1270499996771/British-PM-Gordon-Brown-006.jpg\" alt=\"British PM Gordon Brown\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gordon Brown; taking Malala's battle back to Pakistan. Photograph: Luke MacGregor/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke MacGregor/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aisha's father and mine both hail from a village in the Chach region of Pakistan, which borders Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where the Swat Valley is located; the valley which is home to Malala and her family. People from the Chach make up the second largest community of Pakistanis in Britain with sizeable populations in Birmingham and Bradford; people with origins in the Mirpur region in Pakistani Kashmir make up around 70%. </p> <p>Although the Chach region is free from Taliban rule, it still follows the stringently patriarchal Pakhtunwali code of conduct which is essentially obsessed with controlling women's behaviour. You see, the Chach people hold their honour very dear; and honour for the Chach or Chachis is inextricably linked to a woman's virginity, so the slightest irregularity in a woman's behaviour threatens the reputation of the clan \u2013 men as well as women. And when a community's value system is based on honour, a blemish could have long lasting repercussions. Since female virginity is deemed to be such a liability, it follows that women's behaviour and movements must be strictly controlled.</p> <p>This is why educating girls is deemed to be destructive for this community. Not only would schooling broaden a girl's mind, it might also provoke her to rebel against the system, thereby also dishonouring the clan. I have heard uncles say:</p> <blockquote> <p>Why would I want to teach my daughter how to write? So she can write love letters? </p> </blockquote> <p><br>Aisha's father was unable to appreciate the value of schooling his daughter so he chose to terminate her compulsory education. He was also deeply uncomfortable about his 14 year old daughter coming into contact with the opposite sex in the classroom. </p> <p>The common method for fooling the education authorities during the 1980s was to buy a plane ticket \u2013 one way of course - purely for the purpose of presenting it as evidence that the schoolgirl was being sent to Pakistan for good. The ticket was then returned to the travel agent for a nominal fee. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Aisha stayed in inner city Bradford, swapping school for an intensive course of domesticity, to prepare her for imminent marriage. Since the family lived in a rear house, in a back-to-back Victorian terrace, Aisha could easily venture out into the yard without being seen from the street. And if she needed to go any further, then she was draped in a black bhurka from head to foot, with matching face veil \u2013 which she still wears today. </p> <p>After a year or so, Aisha's father feared the authorities were on to him so he swiftly sent her to Pakistan. I met my cousin a few years later, when she returned with her Pakistani husband, a child in her arms and another on the way. With her husband's level of education even poorer than hers, and with Aisha relying on him to run her errands, it made tricky work of the simplest tasks. The first time she sent him out to buy a tin of tomatoes, he returned with baked beans. Not only did family life make it impossible for Aisha to take up her studies where they'd been interrupted, she perpetuated the cycle by marrying off her own daughter at a young age too \u2013 although Aisha did allow her the concession of completing her compulsory years in school. </p> <p>Today, Aisha is barely 40 years old and she is already a grandmother. I am acutely aware that my life might have been very different had my father played a greater role in my upbringing. Moreover, I could never understand how someone as independent and educated as my mother could marry into my father's conservative family in the first place. The mystery was finally unravelled in the course of my current research about <a href=\"http://www.brad.ac.uk/theatre/whats-on/BHM/Cartographies-of-love/\">Muslim women's experiences of love and marriage</a>. I decided to include my mum among the three generations of Pakistani women I interviewed in Bradford and Kirklees.</p> <p>Mum explained that her parents had originally planned for her to marry one of her cousins from their ancestral village in the Punjab. The system secured family ties and offered some guarantees about the suitor's character and standing, since he was already known to the bride's parents. But the plan changed after mum was deemed to be too overqualified to marry from among the pool of cousins that had been lined up. Like Malala's father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, my grandfather was also committed to educating his daughters. So much so that villagers mocked him for selling land to pay for school fees. They taunted: </p> <blockquote> <p>You're flogging the most valuable commodity you have, and you're squandering it on your daughters! What's the point of educating them? And besides, where will you find men to marry your girls?</p> </blockquote> <p><br>My grandfather eventually left the village for Rawalpindi so he could offer his daughters the same educational opportunities as his son. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398883593\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350657522707/Malala-Yousafzai-002.jpg\" alt=\"Malala Yousafzai\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malala Yousafzai. Fighting back. Photograph: Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, my father was a family associate settled in Britain. He wrote to my grandfather asking for his daughter's hand. With the concept of courtship completely non-existent, mum's acceptance was based on a handful of letters that were exchanged between her father and the suitor. Although my grandfather had reservations about the suitor's notoriously conservative family background, he reasoned that someone who'd been living in England for almost ten years must be well educated and westernised. You see, the suitor had left Pakistan whilst he was mid school, in his early teens during the 1950s. </p> <p>Mum told me:</p> <blockquote> <p>I could see that my father preferred the idea of me leading a married life in England where I could fit in better, rather than in our village. Because that was pretty much the alternative.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Little did she know that as soon as her husband arrived in England, he headed straight for the textile mills of Bradford where a willingness to graft was all that was needed. Work was plentiful, well-paid, and didn't require much English, nor any skills or qualifications. </p> <p>In fact, it was mum's qualifications which proved to be our saving grace when she found herself left in Bradford with three children to raise by herself, several years later. My mum echoed Malala's words as she reflected:</p> <blockquote> <p>By giving me an education, my father gave me the means to stand on my own feet.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>She also told me that when the villagers had mocked her father for selling the family land, he had replied:</p> <blockquote> <p>A daughter's education is more durable than a dowry. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>As I mark Malala Day on November 10th, I'll be thanking men like my grandfather as well as men like Ziauddin Yousafzai for their wisdom in understanding the value of educating their daughters. I'll also be thinking about my cousin Aisha as well as the 32 million girls around the world who are denied the basic freedom to learn every day.</p> <p><em><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/irnaqureshi\">Irna Qureshi</a></strong> is an anthropologist and writer on British Asian culture. <a href=\"http://www.bollywoodinbritain.wordpress.com/\">She blogs about being British, Muslim and female in Bradford.</a> Her latest work, <a href=\"http://www.brad.ac.uk/theatre/whats-on/BHM/Cartographies-of-love/\">Cartographies of Love</a>, is a live performance based on intimate conversations about love with three generations of Muslim women in and around Bradford and Kirklees.</em></p>",
  "<p>It was not so much the wish to break new ground as rather more mundane considerations that led <a href=\"http://www.sackville.w-sussex.sch.uk/default.php\">Sackville School</a> to look for alternative ways to communicate with its partner schools.</p> <p>Creating links with schools in Uganda and Afghanistan was all very well, but when their electricity supplies were intermittent and their internet connections poor, the prospects of establishing regular contact seemed to fade. So instead Sackville turned to mobile phones, opening up a whole new world of cross-cultural co-operation.</p> <p>The result, in a project backed by financial support from Nokia, has been a series of collaborations, ranging from pupils swapping picture messages of each other's breakfasts and creating a <a href=\"http://www.wordle.net/ from\">wordle</a> the content of text messages exchanged between the two schools, to videos with explanatory pop-up messages.</p> <p>\"Originally it was because we knew there would be difficulties with online connections, but we ended up really exploiting the potential of mobile technology,\" says Nick Falk, leader of international development at Sackville, in East Grinstead, West Sussex.</p> <p>The benefits of using mobile phones to communicate with schools in less developed countries were brought vividly home on a recent trip to sub-Saharan African. \"There are parts of Uganda that have a better mobile signal than parts of Sussex,\" Falk adds.</p> <p>International links are nothing new in education. The benefits of increasing students' global awareness have been recognised for some time. But the days when connections with schools and pupils in other countries boiled down to an annual exchange trip and the occasional letter are long gone. Now schools are utilising an increasing array of tools to broaden their pupils' minds.</p> <p>Sackville has a long tradition of embedding international links within the curriculum, with partner schools across the globe. Communication with European schools tends to be via the internet rather than mobiles, using tools ranging from the video conferencing application <a href=\"http://flashmeeting.e2bn.net/\">FlashMeeting</a>, to hosting spreadsheets on Google Docs so they can be accessed by any of the participating schools and exchanging podcasts of science experiments.</p> <p>Sometimes the technology failure is where it is least expected. Sackville had to bow out of a three-way link using FlashMeeting when its connection disappeared, leaving its partner schools in Uganda and the island of Reunion to continue chatting.</p> <p>But Falk, an <a href=\"http://www.etwinning.net/en/pub/index.htm\">eTwinning</a> ambassador for the <a href=\"www.britishcouncil.org/schools\">British Council</a>, is in no doubt of the value of using technology to bring schools closer together. Peer learning, improving motivation and collaborative working are just some of the benefits he cites, as well as CPD for the teachers involved.</p> <p>\"Technology has made it increasingly easy to form these partnerships,\" he says.</p> <p>The way schools use technology is evolving all the time. At Sackville, the emphasis has shifted towards the interactive web 2.0 tools, such as blogging and video sharing. \"Email is old hat,\" says Falk.</p> <p>Similar changes have taken place at <a href=\"http://www.adel.leeds.sch.uk/\">Adel Primary</a> in Leeds. Its first web-based forays into international links involved uploading videos of traditional playground games, created with the help of parents and grandparents, but recent work have been more interactive.</p> <p>Earlier this year, a project on sport and fitness saw Adel pupils using blogs, Skype and FlashMeeting to connect with children in partner schools in Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Iceland, under the auspices of the <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/comenius.htm\">Comenius</a> project run through the British Council.</p> <p>\"This sort of work helps break down preconceptions and helps prepare the children to live in a more global society,\" says Sarah Stead, year 1 teacher and international co-ordinator at Adel. \"It also helps so much with their IT skills. If they're blogging for someone in Italy or Spain to read, it makes it much more real and gives them a purpose.\"</p> <p>Greater use of video conferencing is next on the agenda for Adel, alongside developing links with a school in Soweto in South Africa. Until recently the Sowetan school did not have access to the internet, but now that obstacle has been removed, opening up a wealth of opportunities to work together.</p> <p>\"It was quite difficult communicating with them, so parcels and letters were great,\" says Stead. \"But now they have got the internet we're hoping to create an online chess game so the children can play each other.\"</p> <p>At <a href=\"https://www.pgfl.org.uk/schools/stpf/Roch/default.aspx\">Roch Community School</a> in Pembrokeshire, pupils took part in a learning environment project, in conjunction with schools in Germany, Spain, Poland, the Czech Republic, Greece and Finland.</p> <p>The children put together a video about their school, learning film and editing techniques in the process, while smaller groups created their own work, using programs including <a href=\"http://audacity.sourceforge.net/\">Audacity</a> for voice-overs and <a href=\"http://microsoft-photo-story.en.softonic.com/\">Photostory</a> to add text and commentary.</p> <p>Blogging and chatrooms gave the pupils the chance to interact directly and establish friendships with children in their partner schools. Teachers also had the opportunity to learn from each other, sharing ideas in an online staffroom, says Fran Jenkins, international co-ordinator at Roch.</p> <p>International links can have a particular effect in rural schools, according to Steven Hales, recently retired partnership head of <a href=\"http://www.burnhammarket.norfolk.sch.uk/\">Burnham Market</a> and <a href=\"http://www.walsingham.norfolk.sch.uk/\">Walsingham</a> primaries in Norfolk. One of the early initiatives he oversaw at Burnham Market was a collaboration with a Swedish school to produce an animation based on the adventures of Erik the Viking.</p> <p>\"Not only did our pupils find out about children in Sweden, but it also helped their IT skills,\" Hales says.</p> <p>Such links are also beneficial for teachers, he adds, providing an insight into how schools are run and lessons are taught in other countries.</p> <p>At Walsingham, a project on pets brought together schools in Lithuania, Germany, Sweden and Turkey. It culminated in a pet Eurovision, with each class posting a pet photo and then voting for their favourite, won by the Turkish school who managed to get a horse to poke its head through their classroom window.</p> <p>\"It is really important for children in isolated schools to look outwards and connect with the world,\" says Hales. \"Taking children on a visit is great but there are always logistical problems. Now there are other ways of meeting, such as through video conferencing or Skype, and as long as your set-up is robust you can do it.\"</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

Red, white and blue glow sticks were waved liberally among the 12,000 Romney supporters as Rock, wearing black t-shirt and black leather hat, swaggered through&#xa0;Sweet Home Alabama and other hits.</p> <p>Rock had the crowd in a near frenzy as he ended his performance with a piano-top rendition of Born Free, the song Romney has adopted as his campaign motif, before Romney appeared on stage in white shirt and tie, alongside his wife Ann.</p> <p>The former Massachusetts governor is not renowned for whipping up crowds, and he was true to form here, his sedate performance hardly capitalising on the rock concert vibe that had been laid on a plate for him. Still, Romney got big cheers from a crowd that had waited hours in the freezing New Hampshire cold to see his final nighttime rally before the polls open.</p> <p>\"This is where my campaign began. This state got me started,\" he said. \"Tomorrow your votes and your work right here in New Hampshire will help me become the next president of the United States.\"</p> <p>There were cheers in all the right places \u2013 even when Romney chipped in the inane line \"Tomorrow we begin a new tomorrow\" - with the vehemence of the crowd prompting Romney to remark \"My goodness,\" at points, but this was not a new speech, with much of it similar to an address Romney gave in Virginia earlier on Monday.</p> <p>His supporters either didn't know or didn't care however, and whether because of Mitt Romney or in spite of him, the mood as people filed out into the crisp Manchester night felt celebratory.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8c98484d-6854-41c7-80fa-5b87806bd4f6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352180355278/df1b4525-1f1b-409b-97c0-00049907588f-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Mitt Romney final rally in New Hampshire\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney shakes hands with supporters  in Manchester, New Hampshire.

In the Iowan capital Des Moines, Obama spoke to a packed downtown rally of 20,000 people braving freezing temperatures.</p> <p>It was a moment of poignant memories for the First Couple. \u201cI have come back to Iowa one more time to ask for your vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where our movement began.\u201d</p> <p>Obama recounted tales of his early campaign, talking of a bare bones operation in 2008 that turned American politics on its head. \u201cYou welcomed me and Michelle into your homes,\u201d he said. He also told a lengthy anecdote about how his old campaign slogan of \u201cfired up, ready to go\u201d came about at a South Carolina event.</p> <p>Michelle Obama also took the stage and reminisced about past campaign events in Iowa, including \u2013 apparently \u2013 once seeing her spouse\u2019s face carved out of butter. The First Lady spoke softly, despite a microphone, and was clearly feeling the magnitude of the moment. \u201cThis is an emotional time for us. This is the final event of my husband\u2019s final campaign,\u201d she said. She appealed to voters to remember the promise of four years ago, here in the state where it all began. \u201cHe stayed true to himself,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Rock star Bruce Springsteen had sought to warm up the chilly crowd and played songs with none-too-subtle titles like No Surrender and The Promised Land and Land of Hope and Dreams. But the mood overall \u2013 perhaps because of the low temperatures and late hour or just because it came at the end of a gruelling campaign \u2013 felt a little subdued, though undoubtedly cheerful. For a true moment of history it was somewhat reflexive with little wild or loud cheering from the large crowd.</p> <p>Obama himself sounded some of the old riffs from his 2008 campaign, appealing to Americans as a whole. \u201cWe fall and rise together as one people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Then he touted his first term credentials, incuding the ending of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Osama bin Laden and rising home values. Then he appealed to Iowa voters to stick with him at tomorrow\u2019s ballot boxes. \u201cWe are not done yet on this journey. We have got more road to travel,\u201d he said. But it was not all positive, saying Mitt Romney wanted to take America backwards. \u201cafter all that we have fought through together we cannot give up on change now,\u201d Obama said.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-12e16bd8-16b9-4a91-a2bc-a96078f4723f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352177559597/4dd97e9a-e937-4655-bb8a-5729897b0e65-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Barack Obama final rally in Iowa\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama speaks during his last rally in Des Moines, Iowa.

Even if he wins, Obama will not run for office again. This is it.</p> <p>The choice of Iowa seems political, sentimental and practical. Political because Iowa\u2019s six electoral college votes could really matter in a tight election. Iowa is a swing state and up for grabs and some serious presidential attention could be vital. Sentimental because this is the state were it all began way back in January 2008, when Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the caucus here, proving a black outsider could win over white voters with a powerful message of change. Practical because its near Chicago. Once this event is over then it is a short hop home to wait for the results.</p> <p>Certainly the crowds are showing up as thousands of people queued through the streets of downtown Des Moines, braving chilly air and a several-hour-long wait. Though their patience is almost certainly helped by the added attraction of a free Bruce Springsteen concert. You do not get to see The Boss that often in these parts. The event is happening in a knot of streets called the East Village (no relative to the New York neighbourhood). Already a drum band is playing as a large crowd packs into the area, stretching back to Des Moine's Capitol building.</p> <p>Shannon Minschall, a 41-year-old nursing home worker, scored seats in the front row thanks to his sister being the sign language interpreter for the evening. He was exceedingly positive about Obama\u2019s chances of winning the state. \u201cI think he will take it by at least four points,\u201d he said. \u201cConsidering the people he\u2019s had road blocking him in Congress for four years, I think he has done a good job.\u201d But Minschall did admit there was an enthusiasm gap among Democrats. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same enthusiasm as last time but people will show up. They know it is too important,\u201d he added. But in the meantime there is history in the making: Obama\u2019s last rally.</p> <p>Which, makes this correspondent a little nostalgic. I was in the convention hall when Obama gave his 2004 speech in Boston. I went to a 2006 fundraiser at Conde Naste in Manhattan when he was mulling a run (and the mistaken conventional wisdom was he would not). Then came 2008 versus Hillary and after that, the battle versus John McCain and Sarah Palin and the Great Recession. Now it's 2012 and his last ever campaign rally. Even though Obama might have a second term ahead of him, it all shows how remarkably quickly American politics can work. It also makes me feel distressingly old.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b53b6ebd-369a-4c02-b654-964919267f48\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352169049654/c07bab59-2c52-461b-9696-b44936526b40-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Barack Obama in Ohio\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama speaks to supporters in Columbus, Ohio, tonight.

But, look, just this week it was announced the <a href=\"http://www.li.com/media/press-releases/2012-legatum-prosperity-index-american-dream-at-risk-in-key-election-year\">US has crashed out of the top ten of the world\u2019s most prosperous nations</a>.

Ryan, whose voice hinted at being hoarse after a punishing schedule in recent weeks, hit his usual notes of painting tomorrow\u2019s vote as generational in importance.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not just picking a president for four years.

We've made serious mistakes as a country, sometimes dodging apocalypse or genocide by a combination of luck and sheer bloodymindedness. We've let our government take action in gruesome ways \u2013 internment camps, Vietnam, Iraq. And, as citizens, we've stood by while injustices rolled over other people's lives (this individualized list is too painful and too long to articulate).</p> <p>But we tend to learn from our mistakes; we tend to correct them, as best we can. Our always re-enforced self-interest and offhand sense of fairness produces a kind of lazy arc toward justice. Frustration and outrage bring wars to an end (\"We're still in Iraq? Why?\").

It is a time for volunteers ferrying and cajoling voters to the polling stations. So Romney is breaking the convention by continuing to campaign Tuesday in Pennsylvania and Ohio. His campaign staff has just announced that Paul Ryan too is to keep on going in Janesville, Wisconsin, his home state. No big hardship for him. Just in case he fails to make it as vice-president, he kept his name on the ballot for re-election to the House and a little campaign time in the state can't help.</p> </blockquote> <p>The move by Romney is not unprecedented.

Bush visited Ohio in 2004.

Minority, specifically black, voters have grown in their support of same-sex marriage since President Obama announced his backing for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/gay-marriage\">gay marriage</a> in May: it seems to be a rare example where the president's bully pulpit has actually worked.</p> </blockquote> <p>They're talking a lot about gay marriage in Maryland these days.

While he\u2019s here somebody whispers in the ear, you better go back home and protect your stock because God is sending judgment. The thing came through the area. You have to understand the season and the time.

  "<p>David Cameron is poised to defend the green economy after a group of more than 20 Conservative MPs expressed their concern on the issue in a letter to Downing Street.</p> <p>Peter Aldous, the Conservative MP for Waveney, who organised the letter to Cameron, said investment from overseas was vital to rejuvenating UK infrastructure. He said: \"It is vital the government works to encourage and incentivise investment from emerging markets in order for offshore energy to flourish and for our country to be a world leader in renewable energy.\" The letter comes as Cameron pushes for new Middle Eastern investment in Britain's energy production including cash for windfarms.</p> <p>The prime minister will meet the heads of three of the biggest sovereign wealth funds in the United Arab Emirates as he bids to persuade them to make further major investment in renewables and nuclear.</p> <p>However the MPs are worried about the outpouring of anti-green sentiment and what they see as attacks on renewable energy from various sections of the coalition \u2013 chiefly George Osborne. Although the green economy is worth more than \u00a3120bn, and the sector has supplied a third of recent economic growth, Cameron has been notably silent. The strength of Cameron's defence \u2013 and whether it includes pledges on green energy \u2013 will be key to persuading companies holding back tens of billions in investment to put their money in the UK rather than overseas.</p> <p>Greg Barker, the Conservative minister of state for energy, said it was time for the government to \"put its mouth where the money is\" by vocally backing green investment from big companies. There are more than 10 wind companies considering investments in the UK, amounting to tens of billions of pounds, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/26/wind-energy-fears-government-commitment?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">research by the Guardian</a> earlier this year found many were holding off, awaiting the publication of the energy bill \u2013 due later this month \u2013 and greater political backing.</p> <p>Gaynor Hartnell, the chief executive of the Renewable Energy Association, said: \"Cameron has not been doing enough. This is a win-win agenda that should be acted upon. Why are they not getting on and allowing this investment to be made? It's bizarre. They are in panic mode.\"</p> <p>The concerned group of more than 20 Tory MPs behind the letter to Cameron \u2013 who need to hold on to their seats if the party is to remain in government \u2013 have been alarmed by the prime minister's refusal to provide strong backing for green growth, including renewable energy and new forms of low carbon technology. Many of their constituencies are in areas where the growth of green industries such as renewable power, carbon capture and storage and environmental technology has provided the only hope of economic recovery. Their votes will be essential to whoever takes power when the coalition stands down.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that many other Tory MPs would have been vocal on the issue, but could not as they hold government positions, or are under fear of the Tory whips.With tens of billions in investment now in doubt, the Tory leadership is facing serious questions that it has backed a rightwing ideology \u2013 which says green technology is \"costly\" and a \"burden\", according to the chancellor \u2013 over economic rationale.</p> <p>Oliver Colvile, the Conservative MP for Plymouth Sutton &amp; Devonport, who also signed the letter, said: \"It's very important that we as a government don't send the wrong message on renewables. There has been a confusing impression that we have gone cold on green energy.\" Andrew Raingold, chief executive of the Aldersgate group of companies that includes Asda, BT and Microsoft, said it was \"very surprising\" that the government had decided not to trumpet the green economy, as its growth had been a boon to the economy. He said the sector was particularly dependent on government statements, because overseas investors made decisions on whether or not to plug money into the UK based on government pronouncements on policy.</p> <p>He said: \"While the green economy has been a key pillar for growth in the UK's recovery from the global economic crash, policy uncertainty and mixed messages from ministers are undermining this success story. The environmental sector is an area where the UK has strong foundations on which to build and can be one of the building blocks of a genuine export-led recovery in advanced manufacturing and know-how. With competitor economies rapidly building up their capabilities to take advantage of a lucrative global market, it will take strong and consistent UK government leadership to turn its green economy vision into reality.\"</p> <p>The green economy is one of the few manufacturing areas that has provided a positive balance of payments \u2013 more exports than imports \u2013 against key economies such as the US, China and Germany. The UK exports nearly \u00a3800m a year in green goods and services to China, about \u00a3330m to the US, and close to \u00a3300m to Germany. The green economy is now worth more than \u00a3120bn annually, equivalent to 8% of GDP, providing nearly a million jobs, and a third of the recent growth in the UK economy, according to the CBI. Without it, the UK could have been in recession for the last quarter. With it, the UK could be in for more positive trade figures and an economic boost.</p> <p>But the sector went unmentioned at the Tory party conference and David Cameron has refused to make public pronouncements on green growth in the past year. The reason is believed to be the reluctance of the right wing of the Tory party to acknowledge green issues and their belief that green issues represent a burden rather than an opportunity. That was aired last week, when the junior energy minister, John Hayes, said there were \"enough\" wind turbines, in statements that alarmed green industries and potential investors.</p> <p>John Cridland, director-general of the CBI, said said: \"If we can make the right choices, the UK has the potential to earn a significant prize \u2013 grabbing our share of a growing global market and injecting around \u00a320bn into the economy. Let's not waste this opportunity.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron has defended British arms sales to Gulf countries as \"entirely legitimate\" but insisted that the Arab spring was a positive development and there were no \"no-go areas\" in talks with autocratic allies who are fretting about changes elsewhere in the region.</p> <p>Speaking on the first day of a three-day middle east tour, the prime minister rebuffed critics unhappy with the idea of UK defence exports and said his discussions in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, both irritated by rows with Britain, would show \"respect and friendship\".</p> <p>The trip is aimed at drumming up business in both countries for BAE Systems, the defence manufacturer. An important BP oil deal in Abu Dhabi has run into trouble recently.</p> <p>Thirty thousand jobs in the UK were at stake, sales were \"legitimate and right\" and his purpose was \"to help Britain compete and thrive in the global race\" he said. Cameron wants to persuade the UAE to buy Eurofighter Typhoons to replace their ageing fleet of French Mirage jets. The Emiratis have expressed interest in ordering 60 jets. Oman has expressed interest in 12, while the Saudis are considering a second order on top of the 72 they already have.</p> <p>Amnesty International criticised what it described as a \"deeply-disturbing trade-off\" between trade and strategic interests and the promotion of rights and democratic reform. The Campaign Against the Arms Trade condemned what it called \"a very clear UK message of support for these authoritarian regimes\". Promoting arms sales meant concerns about human rights were \"empty words,\" it added.</p> <p>Speaking to students in the UAE's capital, Abu Dhabi, Cameron said: \"I'm a supporter of the Arab spring, the opportunity of moving towards more open societies, more open democracies, I think is good for the Middle East, for North Africa.\"</p> <p>But the UAE's minster of foreign affairs issued a thinly-veiled rebuke as he accompanied Cameron to an airfield to see a display of RAF Typhoons. \"Many people are still caught in the euphoria of the Arab spring,\" said Anwar Gargash. \"But in reality what we're seeing currently is basically an entrenchment of conservative religious parties. They're taking control.\"</p> <p>The two countries have clashed privately in recent months over criticism in the UK media of the treatment of Islamists in the UAE. It and other conservative Gulf countries are unhappy with the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood during the last two years of change across the region.</p> <p>The Saudis object to a parliamentary inquiry into UK relations with them and Bahrain. British government officials are aware of the need to balance military and economic interests in what Downing Street called \"two of Britain's most important strategic allies in the Gulf\" with political and human rights concerns.</p> <p>Both parties fear Iran's nuclear programme and regional ambitions. Cameron said he believed Tehran was trying to develop nuclear weapons which he said would make the Middle East \"a more unstable and more dangerous place\".</p> <p>Amnesty International UK's head of policy and government affairs Allan Hogarth said: \"Selling arms to countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE should only be considered if there are absolutely watertight guarantees over them not being used to commit human rights violations.</p> <p>\"Saudi Arabia has been the recipient of record-breaking arms deals involving the UK, yet these have been highly secretive and there's been little or no follow-up over how the weaponry was used.\"</p> <p>In 2009 the Saudi air force used UK-supplied Tornado fighter-bombers in attacks in Yemen which killed hundreds \u2013 possibly thousands \u2013 of civilians. \"In the past a large Saudi chequebook has apparently meant it could purchase weapons as well as silence over its own dreadful human rights record. It's time for David Cameron to end this deeply disturbing trade-off.\"</p> <p>The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"We do have a large and important defence industry in this country. The prime minister is keen to see that industry prosper. That is an important thing for jobs in this country. We have very strict rules, which are regularly reviewed, on the export of defence equipment.\"</p>",

The number one seeds have now only beaten Houston 3 times in their 18 meetings (in the two teams' current incarnations).</p> <p>Sporting started the game with the air of entitlement of a side unbeaten in three months, but when Moffat brought the ball down with his right foot and hammered a shot across his body with the same foot, Houston seemed to get reminded of the hex they have over the team that topped the Eastern standings again this year.</p> <p>As the game went on Houston discovered their bite in midfield, stranded Kamara and Sapong upfield as they played Sporting at their own pressing game. By the time Houston went two-up, the Kansas CIty team were looking very ragged, and by the end of the game they were looking utterly frustrated as Houston got to every ball first.</p> <p>Wednesday night will be a huge test of the SKC team's character. Today belonged to Houston Dynamo.</p> <p>I'm headed off for a quick rest before I come back to cover <strong>LA v San Jose tonight</strong> - though doubtless that'll be a quiet night at the office...

His Houston Dynamo side were outsiders last year, but dispatched Philadelphia with minimum fuss, before that famous win in Kansas City that took them to the MLS Cup final. That time, the Galaxy were an opponent too far, but this year, once again, Kinnear looks to have nursed his side through periodically indifferent form, a long road stretch to start the season etc. and ended up bringing them to the playoffs looking like they\u2019re peaking nicely once again.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5096cea195cb1506d2444875\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-04T20:22:57.819Z\">8.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sporting Kansas City</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sporting come into the playoffs having <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/09/us-open-cup-2012-final-sporting-kansas-city-seattle-sounders\">already won a cup this year</a>. And while that\u2019s been a huge psychological boost for the team that Peter Vermes has built, when I spoke to the coach last month he was insistent that the game that had most impact on his side was losing the Eastern Conference final to today\u2019s opponents last year. In that game, Sporting\u2019s front three of Teal Bunbury, Kei Kamara and rookie of the year CJ Sapong were isolated from their midfield and failed to spark, let alone dominate. Even with Brad Davis limping out of the game, Houston scored twice to eliminate a team who thought they may be about to bring back a title to their brand new stadium.</p> <p>Since then Kamara and Sapong have developed a mentor/mentee relationship that has seen the former thrive on the responsibility, and the latter successfully navigate his inevitable dips in form after his breakout debut season. Sporting\u2019s 4-3-3 has got more solid since last year and the front three seem much more mindful of their defensive duties. And at the back Colin and, of course, the omnipresent Jimmy Nielsen have been the foundational bedrock for the team. Sporting don\u2019t always score as many as they should, but they rarely put themselves in a position where they have to. They were not top of the East by accident.</p> <p>That said, their contests with Houston tend to be tight affairs. With their own emphasis on winning the battle in midfield, the Dynamo match up well with Sporting. Here\u2019s what happened when the two sides last met at Livestrong Sporting Park in September.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYba9B9aL-A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qYba9B9aL-A?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T00:14:57.031Z\">at 12.14am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5096ccde95cb1506d2444872\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-04T20:15:26.538Z\">8.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Houston Dynamo</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Houston arrived in the semis with an efficient performance against Chicago Fire in the one-off wild-card game on Wednesday night. While that was a road game, the general momentum of Chicago\u2019s season since their early Fall highs, made for a curiously unconfident performance from the hosts, starting with Sean Johnson at the back, and Houston rode a confident goalkeeping performance by Tally Hall and two goals by Will Bruin to win fairly comfortably in the end. Bruin, enjoying a breakout sophomore season, was supported admirably by Houston\u2019s midfield, who were smart enough in possession to thwart Chicago\u2019s few attempts at building sustained pressure.&#xa0;</p> <p>The midfield will be key again today. Sporting play a physical game and like to press forward en masse when momentum permits. The sides that are successful against them tend to operate wide midfielders who are very aware of their defensive duties, which involves pinning back Sporting\u2019s full backs and tucking inside to support their own central midfielders, whose hands will be full with the interchanging runs of Zusi and Kamara, and the dominant play of Espinoza.&#xa0;</p> <p>Which is all to say that Houston\u2019s playoff specialist coach Dom Kinnear, may have a difficult choice on his hands today. He has a home game and could feasibly be tempted to go for it with the 4-3-3 that briefly sparked the side after the arrival of Oscar Boniek Garcia, or more likely he\u2019ll stick with the 4-4-2 and focus on cancelling Sporting out, while hoping his side can pick their moments as they did against Chicago, or pick up the type of set pieces that Brad Davis thrives on. One decision that seems <em>fairly</em> likely is that there will be no place in the starting line up for Mac Kandji. He may well come on as a late sub to chase the game, but as an attacking option against a side like Sporting, his defensive downside should be too great to risk.</p> <p>You can read about Kanji\u2019s potential contribution and more in our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/nov/02/mls-semi-final-fan-previews\">semi-final fan previews</a>&#xa0;(there\u2019s also a more detailed exchange there between myself and regular commenter <strong>MinAmerica</strong> on the Dynamo\u2019s likely line up, for those of you who want to get really wonky, or just want to laugh when I'm wrong).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5096ca3395cb1506d244486d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-04T20:04:03.960Z\">8.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Welcome to the third of the weekend\u2019s four semi-final first legs, and after last night\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/nov/03/dc-united-new-york-red-bulls-live\">whirl of missed penalties, red cards and own goals at RFK Stadium</a> we\u2019re at Houston\u2019s BBVA Compass stadium this afternoon - as the Dynamo\u2019s brand new home and, so far, fortress, hosts its first ever playoff game, with the visit of Sporting Kansas City.</p> <p>Houston Dynamo come into the game having won their wild-card game against Chicago in midweek, after having rested a number of key players last weekend for their last regular game of the season (when it became apparent that they couldn\u2019t finish above 5th in the East regardless of the score). They\u2019re the lowest remaining seed in MLS Cup, and know that if they are to win the whole thing it will involve playing the final at a Western rival\u2019s stadium. That may be a long way off, but at least Houston know that their unbeaten home record gets to be a factor in the remainder of their campaign, starting today.</p> <p>Sporting meanwhile, are unbeaten on a stretch going back to 28th July, a run that includes wins over both their potential Eastern final opponents, DC United and New York Red Bulls, but that perhaps intriguingly also includes a 1-1 tie with today\u2019s opponents at Sporting\u2019s Livestrong Park home. While today\u2019s game at the BBVA could be crucial, everyone present will have half an eye on what happens in the second leg when these two sides meet again in Kansas City, especially with what happened the last time these two teams met in a playoff situation, in last year\u2019s Eastern Conference final.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aktERV-dms4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aktERV-dms4?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>I\u2019ll be back soon with more build up and team news, in the meantime, you can watch the highlights above, read&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/oct/30/mls-cup-previews-2012\">our playoff guide to all the teams</a>, or&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/nov/02/mls-semi-final-fan-previews\">the fan previews for the semi-finals</a>, or perhaps&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/nov/01/mls-playoffs-chicago-fire-houston-dynamo\">how the Dynamo got here</a>&#xa0;in Wednesday night\u2019s game...or just enjoy your ribs, then smear up the phone or the keyboard, as you tweet your thoughts to&#xa0;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/KidWeil\">@KidWeil&#xa0;</a>or email&#xa0;<a href=\"mailto:graham.parker.freelance@guardiannews.com\">graham.parker.freelance@guardiannews.com</a>.

  "<p>Inside the foyer of a 12-storey building in the devastated beach community of the Rockaways, a handful of residents gather around a bar of power points from an emergency generator, mostly charging their phones. A transistor radio provides news updates on the coming storm and the dropping temperatures outside. Boxes of food and water line the floor, donated by volunteers. </p> <p>They have food to eat, water to drink. The lucky ones have running water to wash in, although those who are sheltering here from the Dayton building opposite do not. They have to walk down pitch-dark staircases to the swimming pool to fill buckets to flush their toilets.</p> <p>They're doing OK so far, they say, thanks to the kindness of strangers. What they don't have, however, is power or any idea of when it will be restored.</p> <p>A full week after this small coastal area in the Queens borough of New York City was battered by superstorm Sandy, tens of thousands are facing plummeting temperatures with no electricity or heat and a big nor'easter storm that is due to hit overnight on Wednesday .</p> <p>Rumours circulating on the peninsula vary depending who you talk to. Those in charge of the volunteer networks that have sprung up here say it could be anywhere from a month to a month and a half before power is restored, others hope and pray it could be sooner.</p> <p>A call to the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), yields little other than a recorded message in which no date is given for power restoration in the Rockaways, where a substation was destroyed by hurricane Sandy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398886040\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352157330129/-140.jpeg\" alt=\"Brynda Palmer-Dowery\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brynda Palmer-Dowery.  </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen McVeigh for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brynda Palma-Dowery, a receptionist at a PR firm, who lives on the forth floor of the building on Shorefront Parkway and is keeping herself warm by turning the oven and burners on, said that she was one of the \"blessed\".</p> <p>But she is worried about the coming storm, the cold and how long everyone is going to last without heat and light.</p> <p>\"We've got this little nor'easter coming,\" she said. \"We want to know when LIPA is coming.

We don't know anything.\"</p> <p>There are worries too, about what is already happening when darkness falls in the community and whether things will get worse.</p> <p>Palma-Dowery said she heard on the news of looting and gangs with guns further down the peninsula, in the Far Rockaway.

Right now we're trying to prepare for the storm and we're trying to get blankets to people. We need volunteers and we need empty trucks. We need to get this stuff out of here so that it can be turned into a warming center.\"</p> <p>She, too, is worried about the chaos that might ensue if the power is not restored, or light is not set up soon.</p> <p>Gesticulating behind her, to the west, she says: \"These neighbourhoods down that way, that is where to watch. There are gangs down there and people are scared. Woman and children are at risk. They need generators and they need lights. There is one big floodlight here, brought in by the mayor's office. They need that every five or six blocks.\"</p> <p>\"At night it's very dangerous. You have 17 miles of pitch dark. Below 84th Street, there are gangs patrolling the streets at night. They have guns. It festers and it festers. They have to get into that area before it gets into an impossible situation.\"</p> <p>On Monday, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg talked of the need to get down to the \"micro level\" of help for people in communities hit by the storm. \"There's no doubt that the lack of heat and light is jeopardising the health and safety of people in affected areas.\"</p> <p>Asked whether the agencies, such as the Red Cross or Fema, were doing enough to help, Thompson said: \"This disaster is too big for government aid groups. There were people here yesterday and they were overwhelmed.\"</p> <p>At one point, a group of people wearing Red Cross jackets turn up. They are nurses and mental health professionals, but they cannot talk to the Guardian, they said, because they have not yet assessed the situation and the need here.</p> <p>They stand together and talk to the volunteers. There is concern that there are patients form a residential home who need medical attention.</p> <p>David Andersen, 47, a retired US marine from Queens, who has been helping residents for the past few days, said: \"Literally everywhere you go people need help.\" </p> <p>He points behind him to the piles of debris piled up alongside the mountains of sand on the dirt roads outside houses. \"It's the basic necessities people take for granted. They realise how important they are. I see all the agencies trying their best. It's so limited that people feel that they aren't here and that's tough.</p> <p>\"That's what Iraq looks like,\" he added. \"People here aren't supposed to experience this\".</p> <p>Other voluntary groups are less charitable about government and other agencies.</p> <p>Along Rockaway Beach Boulevard, which is littered with debris, smashed up furniture and the mounds of sand that were left behind when the storm surge passed, there are little islands where people are gathered, places that serve as refuges either for those who refused to leave their homes during hurricane Sandy or those who returned to try and repair the damage to their flooded and shattered homes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398886043\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352156418378/-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Sandy Rockaways Queens\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A huge solar panel donated by Greenpeace is powering generators for essentials in the Rockaways.

The store is one of nine volunteer centers dotted around the Rockaways run by the anti-capitalist Occupy movement.</p> <p>Diego Ibanez, who is part of Occupy Sandy relief, said: \"It's ridiculous how long Fema is taking, how long the Red Cross is taking. We are just a small network on Facebook and Twitter and we have helped the people here.\"</p> <p>He said that phase one has been relatively successful thanks to organisations like Occupy. </p> <p>\"Phase one was getting everyone food and water,\" said Ibanez. \"We're not Fema or the Red Cross but we're giving people hugs and boosting morale. Phase two is helping people clean their houses and clean their yards. </p> <p>\"They went through the storm. They are not scared. But people now need electricity. The talk is of it being into December. We are going to put the pressure on the electricity company.\" </p> <p>Back at St Francis Church, Thompson and Jaime Jordan, who set up a Facebook page Rockaway Emergency Plan, talk to a woman from Bloomberg's department about how to get through the next few days.</p> <p>\"The situation is there are a number of people here who are unwilling to leave their homes\" said Jordan. </p> <p>\"That is unreal,\" came the response.</p>",
  "<p>Hopes the economy is on the road to recovery have been dampened by figures showing retail sales stalled last month and growth in Britain's services sector almost ground to a standstill.</p> <p>Britons shied away from spending on big-ticket and luxury items in October, leading to the weakest sales growth in almost a year, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Meanwhile, expansion in the UK's services sector \u2013 which accounts for three-quarters of UK GDP \u2013 slowed to a crawl as new business failed to make up for projects completed during the month.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/uk-emerges-from-double-dip-recession-george-osborne\" title=\"\">Chancellor George Osborne had seized on news last month that the economy emerged from double-dip recession</a>, growing by 1% in the third quarter of 2012, as evidence that his policies had put Britain \"on the right track\". But early signs for the fourth quarter now suggest the economy could shrink again, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/oct/31/triple-dip-recession-brace-yourself\" title=\"\">raising the prospect of a triple-dip recession</a>.</p> <p>Rob Wood, an analyst at Berenberg Bank, said: \"With manufacturing output suffering from weak exports and domestic demand, and the service sector flirting with contraction, a fall in GDP in the fourth quarter now looks most likely.\"</p> <p>The BRC said like-for-like sales fell 0.1% last month, compared with October last year. It was a crushing blow after September's figures, which showed growth of 1.5%, had raised hopes Britons had got used to austerity and were out spending again. Averaged out over the past three months, like-for-like sales growth was only 0.4% a month \u2013 the worst in 11 months.</p> <p>Stephen Robertson, director general of the BRC, said: \"Unfortunately it looks like the modest sales revival we saw in September was something of a false dawn. The disappointing figures are a reminder of the difficult economic realities many are still facing. Falling consumer confidence means people are limiting spending to essential items and are cautious about committing to big-ticket and discretionary buying.\"</p> <p>Rising prices helped drive total food sales up by an average of 3.4% but, stripping out the impact of inflation, volumes of food sales were stagnant. The worst hit sector was home accessories, which the BRC said was not considered an essential \"for the consumer with little spare money\".</p> <p>Household spending overall dropped by almost 3% in October, according to Visa. Steve Perry, commercial director at Visa Europe, said: \"The strong growth witnessed in recent months went into decline. October's figures will take some of the gloss off recent optimism as they are a timely reminder that household finances remain under pressure and consumers are exercising caution.\"</p> <p>A forward-looking survey of the services sector suggests this sluggish growth is likely to continue in the fourth quarter. The Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector dropped to 50.6 last month from 52.2 in September, only just above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. It is the slowest pace of growth in almost two years and significantly below analyst expectations of a much smaller decline to 52.</p> <p>Andrew Harker, economist at Markit, said: \"Although there are signs of improvements, [companies surveyed] still referred to the fragility of both demand and confidence among clients. The expectation among firms is for activity to improve over the coming year, but the road to full economic recovery still looks to be a long one.\"</p> <p>The gloomy survey is likely to reignite the debate over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/04/bank-brushes-calls-to-pump-funds-into-economy\" title=\"\">whether the Bank of England will expand its quantitative easing programme this week</a>. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: \"While we just about still lean towards the view that the Bank of England will hold off from more QE for now and monitor how the economy is developing and what impact the Funding for Lending Scheme is having, it is looking an extremely tight call.\"</p> <p>While new orders in the services sector grew in October \u2013 largely due to overseas demand \u2013 they did so at a slower pace than in September and companies said incoming new business did not make up for the completion of existing projects.</p> <p>For the second month running, employers in the services sector cut jobs in October. Business costs rose but companies were reluctant to pass them on to customers as a result of strong competition. Companies did, however, remain relatively optimistic, with 42% of those surveyed forecasting that service sector activity will improve over the next 12 months.</p>",
  "<p>Pay and benefits of top business executives rose by 27% last year to an average of \u00a34m each, despite a backlash against big basic salaries and bonuses, according to research.</p> <p>Income Data Services found that while basic pay rose slightly and standard bonuses fell noticeably, total executive packages have been bolstered by a big increase in long term incentive plans (LTIPs), share awards based on a company's performance over several years.</p> <p>The study of the biggest FTSE 100 companies shows LTIPs have risen more than 80% across the board in the past year, and in the most recent figures for 2011-12 accounted for more than half of chief executives' total remuneration.</p> <p>The slowdown in basic pay and bonuses will be welcomed by campaigners pushing for tough action on executive pay amid concerns about run-away salary costs, especially when companies perform badly.</p> <p>LTIPs can be fairer as they reward directors for achieving long term goals, not pursuing short term profits at the expense of future business.</p> <p>There are still concerns that some schemes allow big payouts to executives at loss-making businesses.</p> <p>\"Many LTIPs are based on comparative performance with competitors, rather than their own company's historical performance, meaning that directors stand to earn a payment even if their company's performance has worsened \u2013 as long as their chosen peer group has done even worse,\" said Steve Tatton, editor of the IDS report.</p> <p>Another feature of the renewed focus on long-term performance is big handouts of shares, many of them awarded in 2008 and 2009, since when the stockmarket has risen more than 60%.</p> <p>\"When share prices have subsequently risen, as they have since the depth of the recession, directors have had the potential to profit from 'windfall' LTP gains,\" said Tatton. \"Shareholders will not take issue with directors' earnings increasing, provided they are doing so in line with company performance and share price.\"</p> <p>Critics seized on continuing rises in total remuneration when the economy has been in recession. The IDS report says the median increase in FTSE 100 chief executives' packages was 10% to \u00a33.2m each.</p> <p>Deborah Hargreaves, former chairman of the independent High Pay Commission's report into executive pay and now director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said: \"At a time of biting austerity for the economy, those at the top of our biggest companies are seeing their pay continue to increase sharply compared to everybody else.</p> <p>\"The balance of executive pay may have shifted from annual bonuses to complex incentive plans, but the effect remains the same. Performance-related pay still encourages excessive risk-taking for short term rewards. Shareholders have tried to rein in some of the worst excesses this year, but this has only been partially successful.\"</p> <p>The figures for executive pay come as the One Society thinktank publishes a report arguing that despite promises to voters by the three big parties at the last general election the gap between the best- and worst-paid workers has widened, and will increase further as a result of existing government policies.</p> <p>The contrast was seized on by Unite, the biggest trade union. \"While millions of working people are either without work, or having their pay frozen or slashed, Britain's boardrooms are finding even more devious ways to squeeze even more cash from their companies,\" said the general secretary, Len McCluskey.</p> <p>The slowdown in basic pay, up by a median of 3.5%, and reduction in bonuses by a median 4.9%, could be attributed to a number of factors, said Tatton.</p> <p>\"Whether as a reaction to Government pressure, shareholder concerns or a worse than expected business environment, it seems the brakes have been applied to the basic pay growth for FTSE-100 bosses,\" he added.</p>"
