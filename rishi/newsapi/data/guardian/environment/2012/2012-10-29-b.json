  "<p>It's a revolting spectacle: the two presidential candidates engaged in a frantic and demeaning scramble for money. By 6&#xa0;November, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will each have raised more than $1bn. Other groups have already spent a further billion. Every&#xa0;election costs more than the one before; every election, as a result, drags the United States deeper into cronyism and corruption. Whichever candidate takes the most votes, it's the money that&#xa0;wins.</p> <p>Is it conceivable, for instance, that Romney, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?id=N00000286\" title=\"\">whose top five donors are all Wall Street banks</a>, would put the financial sector back in its cage? Or&#xa0;that Obama, who has received $700,000 from both Microsoft and Google, would challenge their monopolistic powers? Or, in the Senate,&#xa0;that the leading climate change denier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/aug/02/climate-change-political-funding-us\" title=\"\">James Inhofe, whose biggest donors are fossil fuel companies</a>, could change his views, even when confronted by an overwhelming weight of evidence? The US feeding frenzy shows how the safeguards and structures of a nominal democracy can remain in place while the system they define mutates into plutocracy.</p> <p>Despite perpetual attempts to reform it, US campaign finance is now more corrupt and corrupting than it has been for decades. It is hard to see how it can be redeemed. If the corporate cronies and billionaires' bootlickers who currently hold office were to vote to change the system, they'd commit political suicide. What else, apart from the money they spend, would recommend them to the American people?</p> <p>But we should see this system as a ghastly warning of what happens if a nation fails to purge the big money from politics. The British system, by comparison to the US one, looks almost cute. Total&#xa0;campaign spending in the last general election \u2013 by the parties, the candidates and independent groups \u2013 was \u00a358m: about one sixtieth of the cost of the current presidential race. There's a cap on overall spending and tough restrictions on political advertising.</p> <p>But it's still rotten. There is no limit on individual donations. In a system with low total budgets, this grants tremendous leverage to the richest donors. The political parties know that if they do anything that offends the interests of corporate power they jeopardise their prospects.</p> <p>The solutions proposed by parliament would make our system a little less rotten. At the end of last year, the committee on standards in public life proposed that donations <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.public-standards.gov.uk%2FLibrary%2F13th_Report___Political_party_finance_FINAL_PDF_VERSION_18_11_11.pdf&amp;ei=Lr2OUIOWPIrPhAeuyIH4DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFO4v6TrR-5abKp4X3dzhycQfiltA\" title=\"\">should be capped at an annual \u00a310,000</a>, the limits on campaign spending should be reduced, and public funding for political parties should be raised. Parties, it says, should receive a state subsidy based on the size of their vote at the last election.</p> <p>The political process would still be dominated by people with plenty of disposable income. In the course of a five-year election cycle, a husband and wife would be allowed to donate, from the same bank account, \u00a3100,000.&#xa0;State&#xa0;funding pegged to votes at the last election favours the incumbent parties. It means that even when public support for a party has collapsed (think of the Liberal Democrats), it still receives a popularity bonus.</p> <p>Even so, and despite their manifesto pledges, the three major parties have refused to accept the committee's findings. The excuse all of them use is that the state cannot afford more funding for political parties. This is a ridiculous objection. The money required is scarcely a rounding error in national accounts. It probably represents less than we pay every day for the crony capitalism the present system encourages: the unnecessary spending on private finance initiative projects, on roads to nowhere, on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/29/tories-lib-dems-trident\" title=\"\">Trident</a> programme and all the rest, whose primary purpose is to keep the 1% sweet. The overall cost of our suborned political process is incalculable: a corrupt and inefficient economy, and a political system engineered to meet not the needs of the electorate, but the demands of big business and billionaires.</p> <p>I would go much further than the parliamentary committee. This, I think, is what a democratic funding system would look like: each party would be able to charge the same, modest fee for&#xa0;membership (perhaps \u00a350). It&#xa0;would&#xa0;then receive matching funding from the state, as a multiple of&#xa0;its membership receipts. There would&#xa0;be&#xa0;no other sources of income. (This formula would make brokerage by&#xa0;trade unions redundant.)</p> <p>This system, I believe, would not only&#xa0;clean up politics, it would also force parties to re-engage with the public. It&#xa0;would oblige them to be more entrepreneurial in raising their membership, and therefore their democratic legitimacy. It creates an incentive for voters to join a party and to begin, once more, to participate in politics.</p> <p>The cost to the public would be perhaps \u00a350m a year, or a little more than \u00a31 per elector: three times the price&#xa0;of a telephone vote on The X Factor. This, on the scale of state expenditure, is microscopic.</p> <p>Politicians and the tabloid press would complain bitterly about this system, claiming, as they already do, that taxpayers cannot afford to fund politics. But when you look at how the appeasement of the banking sector has ruined the economy, at how corporate muscle prevents action from being taken on climate change, at the economic and political distortions caused by the system of crony capitalism, and at the hideous example on the other side of the Atlantic, you discover that we can't afford not to.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@georgemonbiot</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><em>A fully referenced version of this article can be found at </em><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Monbiot.com</em></a></p>",
  "<p>In any election, politicians' pretty much always-false modesty prompts them to exclaim that they themselves are playing but a part in the march of history. Obama cut an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBorRZnqtMo\">ad</a> that admitted:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Sometimes, politics can seem very small \u2013 but the choice you face? It couldn't be bigger.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Last week, Paul Ryan made a <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/24/14676153-ryan-puts-softer-edge-on-gop-plans-in-major-economic-speech?lite\">feint</a> at bipartisanship with a similar argument:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Mitt and I have a message that's bigger than party.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Hurricane Sandy reminds us of what truly monumental events, and the decisions we make in the face of them, look like.</p> <p>Sandy is not just bigger than any campaign and powerful enough to banish all the feeble fantasies humans s have about our relationship to the physical world. Though Sandy may finally bring a discussion about the environment to the forefront of politicians' minds, one of humanity's only creations that's almost impervious to the kind of force battering the US east coast is denial. (Then again, note the Earth's stubborn, intractable reactions to our abuse.)</p> <p>We can talk about \"man-made\" climate change, but there's a difference between having control over something and taking responsibility for it. Our part in global warming is more like that of someone dropping a lit cigarette in the forest, rather than someone starting a fire for heat.</p> <p>As for arguments about who did or didn't \"build that\" \u2013 Sandy don't care. Buildings are flimsy and our plans even more insubstantial; our opinions revealed to be nothing more than spit and a wish for wind in the right direction.</p> <p>You can sense among political professionals a vague sense of panic about Sandy, which is ancillary to the more specific and very real worries that they harbor about loved ones and their own, mostly likely east coast, lives.</p> <p>We don't yet know Sandy's precise impact on the election \u2013 on a practical level, the storm will disrupt early in-person voting, rallies in east-coast states will go unattended, ads may be inescapable when people are driven indoors, or they may be unwatched in places that lose power. Beyond that immediate effect, will Sandy wash away political trivia and remind voters of the true stakes of picking a president? Will these disruptions freeze the race where it is, or will Sandy remind people of the stakes involved in picking a leader, swaying them toward the one who seems the safer choice?</p> <p>The magnitude of the storm should underscore, not contrast, the relationship between the people's will and predictions that existed before. It's not as though pundits and pols had any better idea of what would happen prior to Sandy's landfall. This election has been unprecedented on so many levels, you couldn't even tweet them all: the amount of money being spent, the ideological divide between the parties, the infuriating vagueness of one candidate's ideas.</p> <p>Sandy is just another element beyond control: you can't even poll a storm \u2013 much like the ideas of low-information, undecided voters, it's nothing but a resounding, echoing howl.</p> <p>The Frankenstorm \u2013 an appellation that would make&#xa0;Mary Shelley&#xa0;wince at the lack of a possessive, though she might approve of the sentiment \u2013 is an immediate, measurable reminder that politics is, in the end, not about messaging and postures and positioning, but the structure of people's lives: who they can turn to when they have no resources left themselves, who they can look to when all the options are bad, and what they can do with what they have left when it seems like nothing at all.</p> <p>We're not choosing the nation's CEO, a boss-in-chief. Mitt Romney's approach to poor performance is eliminating jobs, it's only Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) employees he could fire \u2013 and he's said he <a href=\"http://wonkette.com/488017/mitt-romney-iz-in-ur-hurricane-privatizin-ur-fema\">wants</a> to \u2013 not the natural disaster itself. You can't put the bravery of first responders on a balance sheet, or quantify human loss.</p> <p>Whoever becomes president, the job is really that of a community organizer \u2013 whether that's the role they're prepared for or not.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The Occupy Movement has found an unlikely ally in a senior Bank of England official, Andrew Haldane, who has praised protesters for their role in triggering an overhaul of the financial services sector.</p> <p>Haldane, who oversees the City for the central bank, said Occupy acted as a lever on policymakers despite criticism that its aims were too vague. He said the protest movement was right to focus on inequality as the chief reason for the 2008 crash, following studies that showed the accumulation of huge wealth funded by debt was directly responsible for the domino-like collapse of the banking sector in 2008.</p> <p>Speaking at a debate held by the Occupy Movement in central London, Haldane said regulations limiting credit use would undermine attempts by individuals to accumulate huge property and financial wealth at the expense of other members of society. Allowing banks to lend on a massive scale also drained funding from other industries, adding to the negative impact that unregulated banks had on the economy, he said.</p> <p>The hard-hitting speech is unlikely to find a warm welcome in the Square Mile, which is keen for bank lending to recover to its heady pre-crisis levels and bring accompanying profits and commissions. Lending to individuals and corporations in the UK has fallen to a fraction of the levels seen in 2007 when few banks checked the income status of individual borrowers or the risks being taken by corporate customers before offering a loan. The Bank of England will impose stricter lending rules on banks next year when it takes over regulation of the industry from the Financial Services Authority.</p> <p>Haldane said Occupy's voice had been \"loud and persuasive\" and that \"policymakers have listened and are acting in ways which will close those fault-lines\" with a \"reformation of finance that Occupy has helped stir\". He said inequality was fuelled by bank lending for speculation on property and other assets that enriched some in society at the expense of others.</p> <p>\"The asset-rich, in particular the owner-occupying rich, became a lot richer. Meanwhile, the asset-less and indebted fell further behind. In other words, the pre-crisis asset price bubble acted like a regressive tax,\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>Meteorologists who say that there will not be a hurricane and seismologists who say there is \"no danger\" of an earthquake when they know those events are unlikely, rather than impossible, leave themselves open to legitimate criticism. That does not mean, as Simon Jenkins asserts, that \"science should shut up\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/25/italy-earthquake-laquila-banknote-predict\" title=\"\">Comment</a>, 26 October). It means that the uncertainty inherent in forecasts should be made explicit.</p> <p>One way this can be done is by providing forecasts as probabilities: a 5% chance of an earthquake; a 20% chance of a hurricane. This is how most American weather forecasts are issued, and many meteorologists would like a similar practice to be adopted here.</p> <p>This is unlikely to happen. Within our media, the prevailing view appears to be that British people cannot understand probabilities. As a result, television weather forecasts are visually presented in a way that precludes inclusion of any information about the uncertainty associated with those forecasts. While this continues, forecasts will remain misleading and forecasters will continue to receive unwarranted blame.<br><strong>Professor Nigel Harvey</strong><br><em>Division of psychology and language sciences, University College London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2009Simon Jenkins' confusion between natural forces and human agency is revealed when he equates a forester who \"fails to predict that a tree might fall\" with \"a cook who poisons a customer\". Having wished success to the proposed lawsuit against the Met Office for \"persistently pessimistic\" forecasts, Jenkins retreats to the only standpoint he has left himself: \"If the variables are too great, science should shut up.\" But who should take responsibility for making that call? On the matters in question, the variables will always be too great for certainty. There are costs and dangers associated with knowledge and ignorance. Is silence likely to be cheaper and safer?<br><strong>Professor Clive Coen</strong><br><em>School of medicine, King's College London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2009Simon Jenkins misses an essential point about class and mistakes. Mistakes become a moral problem when they are due to negligence. Negligence occurs when someone does something with less than the averagely expectable competence and care. Where standards are clear, negligence is easy to define. Where they are not clear, public expectations may be unrealistic. In any activity where wide variation of circumstance and contributory factors is normal, it is more difficult to say what constitutes normal performance than where circumstances and factors are circumscribed \u2013 medicine or economic forecasting as opposed to plumbing or carpentry, for example. The fact that these activities are associated with different social classes is secondary.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/italian-scientists-jailed-earthquake-aquila?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">The advisers at L'Aquila</a> were negligent if they failed to exercise average competence; if they were averagely competent, they weren't negligent, they were averagely fallible humans. The fact that people are easily mystified by science, and that the media appear to love it, is not the fault of scientists. I think it is due to the fact that science has come to replace religion and traditional values as the best source of certainty that we have, however fallible it may be.<br><strong>Jerry Palmer</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2009Seismologists go to prison for mistaken predictions.

Is this being done <em>pour encourager les autres</em>? Does no one in the Italian courts recognise the dangers of making overpessimistic predictions, like the 2009 swine flu forecast that Jenkins himself mentions?</p> <p>Do they also not understand that \"there is no evidence of an earthquake being imminent\" does not mean there is definite evidence that an earthquake is not imminent?</p> <p>Science is a tool for understanding the world and for using that understanding to, among other things, make predictions. Most scientists, when tasked with making forecasts, do so to the best of their ability. They do not ever expect to be accorded \"the infallibility of popes\".<br><strong>Roger A Fisken</strong><br><em>Bedale, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2009The judge seems to have given more weight to the justified horror, personal loss and grievance of the victims than to a careful assessment of the roles of scientists and of public authorities, which carry the principal responsibility for decisions made and actions taken.</p> <p>Rather than focusing on the scientists, it would be more appropriate for the judicial system to look into the way the public authorities have acted and not acted before, during and in the aftermath of the L'Aquila earthquake.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/28/mark-clattenburg-accused-racial-slur-chelsea\" title=\"\">allegations that Mark Clattenburg used a \"racist slur\"</a> when addressing Mikel John Obi closed a difficult year for the domestic game. This began in October 2011 with similar incidents involving Luis Su\u00e1rez and Patrice Evra during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/15/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league\" title=\"\">Liverpool's meeting with Manchester United at Anfield</a>, and John Terry and Anton Ferdinand in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/23/qpr-chelsea-premier-league\" title=\"\">Queens Park Rangers's match with Chelsea at Loftus Road</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/dec/20/luis-suarez-patrice-evra-racism\" title=\"\">Suarez received an eight-game ban and a \u00a340,000 fine</a>; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/27/john-terry-verdict-chelsea-guilty\" title=\"\">Terry a four-match ban and a \u00a3220,000 fine</a>.</p> <h2><strong>What is alleged to have taken place?</strong></h2> <p>United kick off at Stamford Bridge with Ashley Cole and Rio Ferdinand having exchanged handshakes following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/22/kick-it-out-crossfire-terry\" title=\"\">the Kick It Out T-shirt protests of the previous weekend</a> which were provoked by the disquiet at the Football Association's handling of the Terry case, and his punishment.</p> <p>On <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/28/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">what was a highly controversial afternoon</a>, Chelsea conceded two early goals before Mikel was booked by Clattenburg in the 76th minute. The Nigerian's yellow card, which was issued for dissent following Javier Hern\u00e1ndez's winner seconds earlier, scored from an offside position, was the moment when Clattenburg's alleged racial slur of Mikel is claimed to have occurred.</p> <p>Mikel and his Chelsea colleagues were also incensed at Clattenburg, who sent off Branislav Ivanovic on 63 minutes, for the second yellow card he issued to Fernando Torres shortly before Hern\u00e1ndez's winner. The decision to dismiss the Spaniard for perceived simulation after a tackle by Jonny Evans infuriated the Chelsea manager, Roberto Di Matteo, and his staff.</p> <p>It is unclear when Clattenburg is alleged to have aimed \"inappropriate language\" at the Spaniard Juan Mata. During United's celebrations of Hern\u00e1ndez's goal, a steward was injured due to a surge from home fans unhappy at the United players' jubilation.</p> <h2><strong>When was the complaint lodged?</strong></h2> <p>While Di Matteo's public post-match comments criticised only Clattenburg's on-field decisions, the manager had already been made aware of the allegations made against the official, and spoken to him. At some point after the match, Mikel is also thought to have visited Clattenburg to speak with him. Chelsea drafted their complaint to the Premier League match delegate and at 8pm announced their official protest.</p> <p>A statement reads: \"We have a lodged a complaint to the Premier League match delegate with regards to inappropriate language used by the referee and directed at two of our players in two separate incidents during today's match.\"</p> <p>The match delegate, Nick Cusack, recorded the official complaint and included it in a report filed to the FA. In response, at round 9.35pm the Professional Game Match Officials Board \u2013 the body which controls Premier League referees \u2013 issued its own statement saying it was \"aware of the allegations\" and that \"Mark [Clattenburg] will cooperate fully and welcomes the opportunity for the facts to be established\".</p> <h2><strong>Who is the match delegate and what was in his report?</strong></h2> <p>Cusack, 46, is a former chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association, who played for clubs including Leicester City, Motherwell and Fulham before retirement in 2002.</p> <p>Cusack acted purely in a secretarial capacity on Sunday evening, recording Chelsea's complaint. It is understood that Clattenburg filed his own \"extraordinary report\" to the FA regarding the accusations.</p> <h2><strong>What happened next?</strong></h2> <p>On Monday morning, the referees' union <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/29/mark-clattenburg-full-support-referees-union\" title=\"\">offered its full support to Clattenburg</a>. A statement says: \"Prospect is committed to helping to eradicate racism in football and in society generally. In the context of that commitment, Prospect is offering full support to Mark Clattenburg in relation to the allegations made against him.\" At 3pm, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/29/mark-clattenburg-fa-statement-chelsea\" title=\"\">the FA confirmed an investigation was being launched</a> \"relating to allegations made following Sunday's fixture at Stamford Bridge\" to decide if he should be charged.</p> <h2><strong>How long will the FA's inquiry last?</strong></h2> <p>There is no definitive timescale though the FA will hope to reach a decision regarding whether Clattenburg has a case to answer as soon as possible.</p> <h2><strong>Who will the FA speak to?</strong></h2> <p>Mikel, Mata, and Clattenburg, as the key people at the centre of the allegations. Clattenburg's assistant referees, Michael McDonough and Simon Long, plus the fourth official Michael Jones, who were in ongoing conversation via their two-way microphone system during the game. If Clattenburg used the terms alleged then McDonough, Long and Jones should have heard them. Yet as Fifa, the game's global governing body, ruled that these conversations should not be recorded, any evidence depends on the officials' memories.</p> <p>The FA will also wish to speak with any players from either side who were close to the pair during the separate alleged incidents. Di Matteo and any of his backroom staff who have potential evidence will also be spoken to.</p> <h2><strong>Why are conversations between officials not recorded?</strong></h2> <p>This is a Fifa directive. The Guardian contacted the governing body but it was unable to offer an explanation. Gordon Taylor, the PFA chief executive, believes the practice should be adopted: \"That could be an aid for clarity over what exactly has happened.\"</p> <h2><strong>Are there any precedents?</strong></h2> <p>While not an exact precedent, Chelsea lodged a complaint against Graham Poll in November 2006 after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/nov/06/match.sport15\" title=\"\">he sent off Terry during a 2-1 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane </a>, a decision that caused fury among his team-mates and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, then the manager.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1337626/Graham-Poll-I-scarred-Chelsea-aggro-Spurs-brilliant.html\" title=\"\">Two years ago Poll told the Daily Mail</a>: \"Terry came to see me immediately after the game, the first time in my career any player had done that. He seemed happy to accept my explanation of the two yellow cards. But the day after the game Ashley Cole accused me of having told Chelsea's players I wanted to 'teach them a lesson' and Terry said I had said one thing to him on the pitch and another in the dressing room after the game. A fortnight later Chelsea withdrew all of their allegations and Terry was fined \u00a310,000 for what he had claimed.\"</p> <h2><strong>What punishment could Clattenburg face if charged then found guilty?</strong></h2> <p>A fine plus a lengthy ban, or even being struck off for life, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/29/mark-clattenburg-may-not-referee-again-says-winter?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">according to Jeff Winter, a referee of more than 25 years</a>. \"If a match official has used racial insults or language to a player then he's for the high jump,\" he told Radio 5 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/5live/\" title=\"\">Live</a> . \"He won't be getting a four-match or an eight-match ban, it'll probably be the end of his career, but that is if indeed he did say anything.\"</p> <h2><strong>What lessons can the FA learn?</strong></h2> <p>In a word, brevity. The FA will be keen that the timescale of the investigation and prosecution of any potential charge is succinct after Su\u00e1rez's case took two months to complete, and Terry's a year. \"We've got to learn the lessons of the last 12 months,\" Taylor said. \"This is extremely serious for the referee involved so that's why it's important that it is dealt with in the most thorough manner and as quickly, efficiently, and transparently as possible.\"</p> <h2><strong>Why has Clattenburg been omitted for this weekend's games?</strong></h2> <p>According to the PGMO, the body \"believes that with any football match the focus should not be on the officials but on the players and the game itself. Mark Clattenburg is one of the elite referees in world football and, in these circumstances, the intense level of scrutiny would detract from the match and be unfair to the clubs and the supporters of both sides\".</p> <h2><strong>Could it lead to criminal investigation?</strong></h2> <p>Quite possibly, after the Society of Black Lawyers wrote to the Metropolitan Police Service demanding that they look into the incident. \"Although this matter may be investigated by the FA, it is appropriate that the MPS independently see if a racially-aggravated offence has occurred,\" they wrote. The police confirmed they had received the letter but said it was by no means certain an investigation would follow. Separately, the force has launched an investigation into the incident where the steward was injured.</p> <h2><strong>What about the FA's Respect campaign?</strong></h2> <p>Whether Clattenburg is charged or not, this latest episode hardly helps relations and tensions within the game as the focus now shifts to Wednesday evening, when Lee Mason officiates the same two sides in a Capital One Cup tie.</p> <h2><strong>How have racism groups responded?</strong></h2> <p>Currently, Kick It Out is not commenting, keeping a watching brief.</p>",
  "<p>Rosemary and I are having a competition. Who can last longest without turning the heating on. We are both neck and neck, tottering around in several woollies with our hot water bottles, living mainly in the kitchen, and baking things slowly. I've done bread, peppers, potatoes and quinces, which take for ever. Why heat the whole place when the oven is blazing in the kitchen?</p> <p>But I do worry about the dog at night. Its coat is a fairly thin white number, which has to do for both summer&#xa0; and winter, and I foolishly brushed it with its new Furminator, which removes all excess fur rather ruthlessly, cutting down on the dog-hair-tumbleweed that clogs our home, but perhaps making the poor dog feel chilly at night. So I tuck it up in a little blanket. It's just one worry after another.</p> <p>Rosemary also wraps herself in Stanley's Mistress \u2013 her late cat's favourite blanket, which he loved intensely. But she is having a bit of trouble with the gap between her socks and the bottom of her lined jeans. And I'm having problems finding some lovely fluffy bed-socks. Or any bed-socks at all. Women's only go up to size 8\u00bd. I take 9\u00bd B \u2013 shoes have been a lifetime's problem for me \u2013 and men's bed-socks don't seem to exist. Perhaps they're considered cissy, but come on chaps. Own up. You need them.</p> <p>Fielding just keeps his same socks on, day and night, upsetting his wife and giving himself a fungal infection. Being rather a wet, who's usually on the Lemsip by mid-October, he's already in head-to-toe thermals, with all heaters on max.</p> <p>Luckily, Rosemary and I are just pretending and are rather mean and stubborn. We could just about afford to turn the heating on if we really wanted to. But also we're practising, for the day when we can't. Coming shortly. Then it will be goodbye amusing competition, and hello hypothermia. Some people have got there already.</p> <p>Like Bob Cratchits, warming their hands round the candle, but with fuel companies and a government meaner than Scrooge. And it's getting colder and colder \u2026</p>",
  "<p>It will now publish Fifty Shades of Grey and Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov; Pippa Middleton's recipe and craft book and Nigella Lawson's latest cookbook. Penguin, the most famous name in British publishing, has confirmed its merger with the German-owned Random House, creating the biggest book publisher seen, accounting for about one in four of all books sold.</p> <p>But the news immediately unsettled some in the industry, which has already seen thousands of bookshops close as readers increasingly turn to Amazon for printed and now electronic books.</p> <p>Andrew Franklin, founder of Profile Books, publisher of titles including Lynne Truss's Eats, Shoots and Leaves, said the deal was a \"great shame\" for publishing, and predicted that Penguin would lose its separate identity. \"The myth is when you combine two great companies you get one even greater company,\" he said. \"This will end up a complete takeover of Penguin.</p> <p>\"It isn't by chance that every Tesco looks the same. [Big publishers] love to promote diversity and localism, but that's not how it works.\"</p> <p>Authors' representatives were more optimistic. Kate Pool, deputy secretary general of the Society of Authors, said that if the new venture delivered on its promises to continue to invest in content and titles at its current levels, then authors had nothing to fear.</p> <p>\"If they keep their promises then it could well be that at the coalface it doesn't feel that different to the average author. If publishers are struggling because the sands are shifting then they need reinforce what they have always done well \u2013 good rights deals, good advances.</p> <p>\"Given all the other upheavals confronting the publishing industry, this is just a drop in the ocean.\"</p> <p>Founded by Allen Lane in 1935 to popularise reading with cut-price books aimed at the general reader, Penguin's 77-year independent history came to an end after five months of behind-the-scenes talks involving both corporations. The merged company, to be called Penguin Random House, will be a joint venture in which Bertelsmann, a media conglomerate controlled by the Mohn family, will retain a 53% stake. Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, will retain the balance, with the two sides pledging to stick together for at least three&#xa0;years.</p> <p>The company will have \u00a32.5bn in revenues and almost \u00a3175m in profits.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Franklin did not believe that the creation of such a dominant force would crush independent players, who account for about 44% of the market in the UK. \"When you have really huge companies, paradoxically you leave more room for smaller, nimble players,\" he said. \"Look at the film and music industry. It is often the big players struggling, not the independents.\"</p> <p>John Makinson, Penguin's chief executive, who will head the new company's board, said the rationale behind doubling in size was to help both publishers make the transition from printed word to ebook.</p> <p>Amazon is now selling 114 ebooks for every 100 printed books, helped by the popularity of its Kindle. \"We are all worried, as the world moves to a more digital structure for content and distribution, that publishing could diminish, fewer books be published and fewer risks taken,\" said Makinson. \"We hope to be able to offer more to readers and authors.</p> <p>\"This will give us resources, capacity and confidence to publish a broad array [of content] and to take risks. That is what good publishing is about.\"</p> <p>Pearson also rejected a last-minute, tentative proposal from Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp owns rival publisher HarperCollins, in part due to the fact that an outright sale of Penguin has tax implications in the US, where it has two-thirds of its business.</p> <p>Penguin Random House will be run by Markus Dohle, chairman and chief executive of Random House Worldwide. It was not clear what would happen to other high-profile publishing executives, not least Dame Gail Rebuck, the chairman and chief executive of Random House. Both companies promised more details in the coming weeks.</p> <p>The two owners are confident that though they will control more than 25% of the global book market, regulators will clear the deal. In Britain, the two groups' market share is closer to 30%.</p>",
  "<p>Baseball fans may have wondered when they were going to hear from Marco Scutaro, the NLCS MVP and unlikely catalyst of the San Francisco Giants. He had been quiet in the Fall Classic, but made himself heard in the top of the 10th inning of Game Four, when the Venezuelan reached out and hit a Phil Coke pitch into center field that drove in what would become the winning run of the 108th World Series. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/29/san-francisco-giants-win-world-series\">The Detroit Tigers swept, the Giants champions again</a>. The World Series trophy they captured back in 2010 has company \u2013 the franchise that won it all five times while based in New York now have a pair of rings in their San Francisco home.</p> <p>There was little drama in this Fall Classic: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/oct/28/rangers-cardinals-world-series-live-6\">no David Freese last-breath strikes to bring Twitter to its knees</a>. Rather, it was a series that brought a different sort of viewing pleasure to the fan. We got to witness a team reach another gear in the final stage of a championship run for all-time, one that formed at lightning speed and swallowed up opponents who thought they had the Giants right where they wanted them.</p> <p>\"Detroit probably didn't know what they were in for,\" said San Francisco general manager Brian Sabean. \"Our boys had a date with destiny and the rest is history.\"</p> <p>How can you argue with that? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/11/san-francisco-giants-cincinnati-reds-nlds-game-5-live\">The Giants arrived in Cincinnati down two games in the NLDS</a>, then were down 3-1 in the NLCS to another team that knows something about destiny, the St Louis Cardinals. They wouldn't lose again, winning seven straight as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/22/st-louis-cardinals-san-francisco-giants-nlcs-game-7-live\">they shocked the Redbirds</a> and rolled over a Detroit team that had their starting pitching lined up perfectly, their hitters confident after sweeping the Yankees. The Tigers had starpower \u2013 Justin Verlander, Miguel Cabrera, Prince Fielder. It wasn't enough, not nearly.</p> <p>There was an energy about this Giants team, a freshness and inner belief that they belonged with the best. They lived on the top step of their dugout, chirpy, loose, free of postseason pressure \u2013 the Tigers looked tight, tentative, spooked. The Giants are the sort of team that gets opponents talking... to themselves. Who could blame them?</p> <p>Bruce Bochy's Giants didn't quite come out of nowhere, but they did come together out of nowhere in the regular season, in the early rounds of the playoffs and in the World Series. We got to see all of it and it was fun, because they were fun, passionate and a group that cared for one another \u2013 a team with human qualities that you couldn't help but enjoy watching.</p> <p>Hunter Pence got the ball rolling \u2013 with his team facing elimination against the Reds, the Giants right fielder delivered <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121011&amp;content_id=39706592&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb\">that now famous pregame speech</a>, widely credited by his teammates with inspiring players to reach within themselves and dig out of their NLDS hole.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Get in here, everyone get in here... look into each other eyes... now! Look into each others eyes, I want one more day with you, it's the most fun, the best team I have ever been on, and no matter what happens we must not give in, we owe it to each other, play for each other. I need one more day with you guys, I need to see what [Ryan] Theriot will wear tomorrow, I want to play defense behind Vogelsong because he's never been to the playoffs... play for each other not yourself, win each moment, win each inning, it's all we have left.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Inspiring words that come to us via Giants third-base coach Tim Flannery's Facebook page, I should add. They seemed to do the trick, and it was only the beginning.</p> <p>Giants passed the baton to Giants, each running their race in ways we couldn't have imagined back in July when they were plodding through the schedule, a shadow of the team they would become.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/20/san-francisco-giants-st-louis-cardinals-nlcs-game-5-live\">In Game Five against the Cards, Barry Zito was the hero</a>, looking every bit the pitcher he was before the Giants signed him more than six years ago \u2013 he stuffed St Louis with their backs against the wall, giving his club the chance to complete a second unlikely comeback. Then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/25/detroit-tigers-san-francisco-giants-world-series-game-1-live\">Zito did it again, this time against Verlander in the World Series</a>, out-pitching the very best, holding the Tigers to a single run in 5.2 innings. Unexpected. So was the relief job another former struggling Cy Young award winner provided out of the pen \u2013 Tim Lincecum, untouchable in his new role, 2.1 innings, five strikeouts.</p> <p>Then there was Pablo Sandoval, the World Series MVP, who hit 12 home runs all season long but managed to blast three on the biggest and brightest stage. Two of them came off of Verlander \u2013 further validation in what would be the game of his life.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/26/detroit-tigers-san-francisco-giants-world-series-game-2-live\">Madison Bumgarner emerged in Game Two</a> \u2013 fighting a mechanical flaw that nearly derailed his season. He recovered from two postseason shellackings, reverting to form in timely fashion, shutting out the Tigers over seven innings while the Giants scratched out a pair of runs on their way to another win. San Francisco had more than survived the softer side of their rotation, and by the time the Series shifted to Detroit the Giants were in command. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2012/oct/28/san-francisco-giants-detroit-tigers-world-series-live-game-3\">Ryan Vogelsong allowed a single run over 5.2 innings</a> \u2013 extending a streak in which he has not allowed one or more runs in his previous seven starts. Lincecum was back again in relief and was overpowering once more, and the Tigers became the first team to be shut out in back-to-back World Series games since the Orioles did it to the Dodgers in 1966 \u2013 yet another accolade for a team that torpedoed themselves to the top of baseball.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/28/san-francisco-giants-detroit-tigers-world-series-game-4-live\">In Game Four</a> the dominant Giants got to show us something we hadn't seen them pull off since the NLCS \u2013 a comeback victory. Playing from behind for the first time in the series, Buster Posey, the comeback player of the year and future NL MVP, hit a home run that gave the Giants a short-lived lead. Delmon Young tied it up for Detroit with a solo shot in the sixth and four innings later, San Francisco's Scutaro was at the plate, putting his team in position.</p> <p>Then came Sergio Romo, the Giants reliever and poster child \u2013 a black-bearded player with the rare ability to run rampant, crack jokes and pull pranks in the dugout for eight innings, and be all business in the ninth. His third save of the Series arrived as he struck out Miguel Cabrera for the final out of the Fall Classic, completing the \"upset\".</p> <p>The Giants celebrated on the mound, enjoying the fruits of their performances, ones which were improbable to all who doubted, but never to themselves.</p>",
  "<p><em>The government has underestimated the costs of its new student fees regime, leaving a black hole of more than \u00a31bn a year, said a report by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) last week. The report \u2013 which led to \"unishambles\" headlines \u2013 says the government's calculations on the net cost to the Treasury of student loans (known as the Resource Accounting and Budgeting or RAB cost) depend on optimistic assumptions. With a potentially harsh spending review looming, it has raised questions about how the government might seek savings in the universities budget. Will the loan repayment package change? Will student numbers be cut? Are other parts of the HE sector at risk? </em></p> <p><strong>Nick Barr, professor of public economics, London School of Economics</strong></p> <p>The design of your loan scheme matters because if you get it wrong it costs too much and you have to cap student numbers. Capping student numbers, when demand is rising, seems crazy. You can hear them sniggering in South Korea. If my fairy godperson were to grant me one wish, I would freeze the salary threshold at which graduates start repaying loans at \u00a321,000, ensuring that this did not rise in line with earnings. Thus inflation would gradually reduce the real value of the threshold.</p> <p><strong>Prof Steve Smith, vice-chancellor of Exeter University and chair of Ucas</strong></p> <p>The truth is we do not know whether the government's figures are right, or Hepi's. There are too many unknowns. How many students took out loans this year and how much did they take out? We don't know that yet. But my personal view is that the reduced intake numbers for this year have made the problem of student support costs go away for now, regardless of what the RAB charge is. However, the early data suggests that this may have been a one-year blip. Numbers should pick up next year.</p> <p><strong>Shabana Mahmood MP, shadow universities minister</strong></p> <p>The government must respond to the Hepi report and explain why ministers have got their sums wrong. Students will be rightly worried that loan terms will change and become more onerous, or that the number of student places will be cut in future. The government must therefore re-think its ideological decision to cut the teaching grant by 80% and treble tuition fees to \u00a39,000. Labour would immediately cut tuition fees to a maximum of \u00a36,000, paid for in part by reversing the corporation tax cut for the banks.</p> <p><strong>Prof David Green, vice-chancellor, Worcester University</strong></p> <p>The Hepi calculation is just speculation and arithmetic, and not based on real-world economics. Politically, of course the Treasury would like fewer people on their balance sheet, but I'd be very surprised if that happens in reality. Shut those people out and they will take the jobs in Tesco, and the people who would have had the Tesco jobs will become Neets [Not in Education Employment or Training].</p> <p>I would expect within three years the vast majority of universities will be charging \u00a39,000 or near that. We haven't got the balance quite right. I think it's wrong that young people should enter the workforce with a debt of such proportion. Graduates, the state and business all benefit from HE. I think all three should make a contribution.</p> <p><strong>David Willetts MP, universities minister</strong></p> <p>The Hepi report is extremely pessimistic and deeply flawed. They assume the worst possible outcome for taxpayers on every variable they've assessed. In fact our RAB calculations occupy the middle ground, with some economists arguing the reverse of this report \u2013 that we have over-estimated cost per student.</p> <p><strong>Howard Hotson, professor of early modern intellectual history, Oxford University</strong></p> <p>Do the government's calculations account for the possibility of a collapse of the euro? Or the inevitability of further climate change by 2045? The unknowns of this moment in history defeat any attempt to predict the future precisely. If government accountants cannot forecast the budget deficit from one year to the next, how can they precisely plot the trajectory of the average graduate's income during the next 30 years?&#xa0;</p> <p>The new university funding mechanism simply transfers risk from the current government to a future generation of students and taxpayers.&#xa0;In such uncertain conditions the only responsible course is to retain a substantial degree of \"pay as you go\" for taxpayers and most students \u2013 precisely what the new funding mechanism has thrown overboard.</p> <p><strong>David Palfreyman, bursar, New College Oxford</strong></p> <p>The welcome new stress on vocational options from the government should mean fewer students in higher education, hence less cost. This would bring us closer to Germany, with more further education and less higher education, and further from Greece or Spain with far too much HE. Which economy would you rather rely on to pay your pension?</p> <p>Continuing public cuts will eventually raise the choice of cutting research money or student support cash \u2013 assuming that protecting the schools budget will always trump universities, and assuming the cost of loans is not lessened by higher interest rates.</p> <p><strong>Alex Bols, executive director, 1994 Group</strong></p> <p>It is essential that any government miscalculation of student support expenditure does not result in claw-back from the research budget. The long-term health of the UK's research base and of the economy as a whole should not be jeopardised by a retrenchment on current spending commitments.</p> <p><strong>Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union</strong></p> <p>Squeezing more money out of students and their families is not the way for us to keep up with our global competitors or ensure UK universities are properly funded. A look at the emerging economies shows that we need more graduates, not fewer, so we do not agree with a cap on numbers or ambition. We think the government should consider taxing big business for the substantial benefits it gains from a plentiful supply of graduates and using that money to expand, rather than reduce, opportunity to study.</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Dr Gary Day, principal lecturer in English, De Montfort University</strong></p> <p>There is nothing more important than education. Can't the government tax the rich more? Stay away from us!</p> <p><strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>Fifty years after his first movie appearance and in his 23rd outing, James Bond has proved to be more popular than ever, with Skyfall enjoying the highest grossing weekend of any film in the series.</p> <p>Sam Mendes's film, which has drawn rapturous reviews from critics, took \u00a320.1m at the UK box office \u2013 the biggest opening of the year so far and the second largest gross ever for an opening weekend, after last year's final instalment of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Quantum of Solace, the previous Bond film, took an initial \u00a314.4m.</p> <p>Skyfall, which stars Daniel Craig opposite Javier Bardem as the villain, Dame Judi Dench as \"M\" and newcomers Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw, was also top of the box office charts in 24 overseas markets and has yet to open in the US, where it arrives on 9 November. With $77m already registered at the global box office, it is on course to easily outpace 2006's Casino Royale (with $586m) as the most successful Bond film of all time.</p> <p>Skyfall, which sees 007 criss-crossing the globe while MI6 and M come under threat from a cyberterrorist plot, is one of the best-reviewed Bond films since the Sean Connery era.</p> <p>Peter Bradshaw of the Guardian praised Mendes's ability to pull off \"a hugely enjoyable action spectacular\" for the 50th anniversary of the series, which began in 1962 with Dr No.</p> <p>\"From the opening in Istanbul to the final siege shootout in the Scottish Highlands, this film is a supremely enjoyable and even sentimental spectacle, giving us an attractively human (though never humane) Bond,\" he wrote. \"Despite the title, he is a hero who just keeps on defying gravity.\"</p> <p>Bond's next outing will be based on a two-part original story by John Logan, the screenwriter of Martin Scorsese's film Hugo. Logan, who co-wrote Skyfall with retiring regulars Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, has been hired to oversee the scripts for Bond films 24 and 25 by the production company Eon after pitching his idea to the series producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson.</p> <p>As with most of the recent efforts \u2013 the exception being Craig's debut in Casino Royale \u2013 the next two films are not based on any particular book by Ian Fleming, who created Bond.</p> <p>Logan's other credits include Ridley Scott's Gladiator, Scorsese's The Aviator and the Oscar-winning animated movie Rango. Reports suggest Craig has already signed on to play Bond at least twice more, implying that he will appear in both of Logan's films.

  "<p>Thirty people <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/29/climate-activists-west-burton-gas\" title=\"\">shut down the UK's newest gas-fired power station and 15 occupied two of its chimneys</a> at West Burton in Nottinghamshire this morning. I am one of them. We have set up two camps, one at the top and one inside the 80-metre-high smoke-stacks. We have also carried up enough supplies to keep us up here for at least a week.</p> <p>It's pretty scary hanging inside the chimney on a portaledge, but we've been rigorously trained and have some very skilled climbers as part of our group. We've made a cosy camp with tarpaulins, and we plan to share a hot meal this evening at the same time as our friends across on the other chimney. The view up here is beautiful. We can see the River Trent and green fields and woods stretching into the distance \u2013 marred only by a single gas and three coal power stations. The chimney makes weird noises which jolted everyone awake several times last night but I'm sure we'll get used to it.</p> <p>Making our home on top of a power station in October may seem like a strange thing to do, but we've thought long and hard about it, and we are here for very serious reasons. We're aware that as we sit here surveying the horizon, the east coast of the US is being devastated by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/29/hurricane-sandy-new-york-live-blog\" title=\"\">Hurricane Sandy</a>. These two things are inextricably connected.</p> <p>We're doing this because the gas plant, which is still being constructed by its operator, EDF, is one of the first in a new dash for gas that has to be stopped. The government and the big energy companies want to build as many as 20 new gas power stations, which would leave the UK dependent on this highly polluting and increasingly expensive fuel for decades to come.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-20093259\" title=\"\">EDF hiked its energy prices by 10.8%</a>, the highest rise of any of the big six energy companies so far this winter. These price rises were triggered by the rising wholesale cost of gas, which the UK is increasingly forced to import as North Sea supplies decline. We already rely on gas for <a href=\"http://www.consumerfocus.org.uk/files/2011/10/Off-gas-consumers.pdf\" title=\"\">83% of our central heating</a> and <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/stats/publications/dukes/2307-dukes-2011-chapter-5-electricity.pdf\" title=\"\">almost 50%</a> of electricity. Increasing this dependence will cause household energy bills to rise even further, pushing those who live the most precarious lives deeper into fuel poverty.</p> <p>By occupying the site and halting construction we hope, for however short a time, to stop this dash for gas and expose the madness of a government that is totally in the thrall of the big energy companies. Intense lobbying by some of the most powerful polluters in the world is eroding even the modest gains made by democratic attempts to shape our energy policy, which culminated in the 2008 Climate Change Act. Over the past five years, direct action campaigns have played a key role in forcing government U-turns around major environmental decisions \u2013 think of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/13/protesters-tamsin-omond-plane-stupid\" title=\"\">Plane Stupid</a> campaign against Heathrow's third runway and the shift away from coal after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/dec/16/ratcliffe-trial\" title=\"\">occupation at Kingsnorth</a>. Now, the government's climate advisers, the independent Committee on Climate Change, are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/13/uk-dash-gas-illegal-climate-committee\" title=\"\">warning that a dash for gas could be illegal</a>, causing the UK to miss the already relatively unambitious emissions reduction targets laid out in the Climate Change Act.</p> <p>With a quarter of the UK's outdated energy infrastructure needing to be replaced, properly supported investment in renewables could generate hundreds of thousands of jobs, radically cut emissions of carbon dioxide and stabilise energy bills.</p> <p>We also have an opportunity to restructure our relationship with energy production through community control. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/30/germany-renewable-energy-revolution\" title=\"\">In Germany</a> 65% of renewables are owned by individuals or communities, while in the UK the figure is less than 10%. With each passing day the need to take radical action to address the linked problems of climate change and increasing inequality grows stronger.</p> <p>We believe that another future is possible \u2013 one that puts the needs of people and the environment ahead of big corporations and profit. That's why we're camped out at the top of these 80-metre chimneys, because history has shown us time and time again the need to go beyond the law when it is failing the people it is meant to nurture and protect.</p>",
  "<p>Hurricane Sandy has closed New York's stock markets as the city prepares for the worst \u2013 but although finance chiefs may be sitting it out at home they are already trying to calculate the costs.</p> <p>The storm is sweeping across a densely populated areas of the country, an area that accounts for 20% of the US population, some of its largest business hubs and much of its most expensive real estate.</p> <p>Dr Tom Jeffery, chief hazard scientist for analyst CoreLogic, said the storm was likely to cause massive disruption to business and infrastructure and threatened nearly 284,000 residential properties valued at almost $88bn.</p> <p>\"The obvious comparison is with Irene last year, but the impact of Sandy is likely to be much, much greater,\" he said. Expected storm surges of 6-11ft in Long Island Sound and 4-8ft in the city of New York would hit transport systems and some of the world's most expensive properties. \"There's likely to be a lot more damage this time,\" he said.</p> <p>As the storm approaches, no one really knows how bad the damage will be but massive disruption has already begun, Randy Frederick, managing director of Active Trading and Derivatives at Charles Schwab, wrote in a note to clients. \"For now we wait and hope that everyone stays safe.\"</p> <p>The hurricane \u2013 or rather, the threat of the hurricane \u2013 has caused a shutdown in most of the financial markets, including the New York Stock Exchange and the NYMEX Commodities Exchange, although the bond markets were open for half a day. Morgan Stanley's chief operating officer, Jim Rosenthal, told Bloomberg TV that the firm had certain essential employees at its headquarters in midtown Manhattan and was prepared for an \"indefinite period\" of storm disruption.</p> <p>Tom Larsen, senior vice-president at risk analyst EQECAT, said economic damages, direct losses associated with the storm and intangibles such as business interruption, additional living expenses, damage to infrastructure, utilities roads, water and power, and municipal buildings which may or may not be insured, are expected to be $10-20bn. Only about half that sum ($5bn-$10bn) will be insured.</p> <p>Insurers do not believe Sandy will prove as deadly, or as costly, as previous US storms. The costliest of all time remains hurricane Katrina in 2005, which killed 1,833 people and cost $105.8bn, more than twice its closest rival, 1992's hurricane Andrew.</p> <p>Ed Noonan, chief executive of insurer Validus Holdings, has predicted that Sandy would cause a \"low to mid-single digit billions of insured loss\". There are a number of factors that make Sandy \"a potentially significant event,\" Noonan told analysts at his company's earnings conference call, including the unusual nature of the storm, lunar tides and warmer seas that will all lead to \"extraordinary levels of participation\".</p> <p>But the losses he is predicting would place Sandy outside of the National Hurricane Center's top 20 most costly storms. Noonan said he expected insurers losses to be similar to hurricane Irene, where insurers were hit with bills for wind damage but many residential losses were not covered by flood insurance.</p> <p>The predicted high levels of flood damage are likely to push much of the cost onto the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the government insurer that covers over 5.5m at-risk homes across the US. NFIP paid out $1.28bn in losses last year from Irene. The insurer is part of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and makes insurance available to at-risk communities that agree to adopt flood management systems.</p> <p>But the size of indirect damages are unknowable at present. Investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs make millions of dollars a day in profits from trading stocks and bonds, and the loss of two full days of trading may have an impact. Shopping, tourism, eating out \u2013 all those consumer activities that make up the lion's share of the US economy \u2013 are on hold.</p> <p>On the other hand, banks rebuilding after storms creates jobs. Economist Peter Morici, of the University of Maryland, sketched out an estimate that such rebuilding would create $20bn to $25bn \"in new direct private spending \u2013 likely more as many folks rebuild larger than before,\" he wrote today.</p> <p>Morici expects hurricane Sandy to actually help the economy in the long run. \"Initially, we will have GDP losses of about $30bn in the fourth quarter, but over the long term, the added stimulus from reconstruction will positively affect GDP by about $10bn,\" he told the Guardian. \"We will get back all the GDP lost and gain some $10bn.\"</p> <p>Another economist, Jim O'Sullivan of IHS Global Insight, also noted that hurricanes may be \"highly disruptive and even devastating to many families and businesses\" but rarely impact the national economy. O'Sullivan noted that effects of hurricanes are minor, causing a \"fairly insignificant impact on the now near-$16tn GDP.\"</p> <p>\"Even Hurricane Katrina, which caused an estimated $110bn in damages and devastated New Orleans in 2005, had a relatively modest impact on national GDP,\" O'Sullivan said. \"Extreme weather typically holds down economic activity initially, but can boost spending and output afterward \u2026 In some cases, spending is even boosted modestly beforehand. Grocery stores were certainly packed in New York City on Sunday.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Consumers in the UK took on \u00a31.7bn of debt in September, including the biggest surge in unsecured borrowing in more than four-and-a-half years.</p> <p>The boost to lending on credit cards, overdrafts and personal loans, which totalled almost three times the average of the previous six months, was welcomed by some analysts as a sign that consumers are rebuilding their battered confidence on a stable unemployment rate and fall in inflation.</p> <p>This optimistic view was offset by concerns from others that a run of below-average wage rises has forced low and middle income households to increasingly rely on debt in the runup to Christmas.</p> <p>Wage rises running below the rate of inflation and a switch in emphasis across commercial and industrial employers to part-time working have pushed down household incomes and increased the pressure to apply for short-term loans, some economists said.</p> <p>Figures from the Bank of England showed that individuals took on \u00a30.9bn of borrowing during September \u2013 a marked change from the summer when borrowing remained static in June and July and net repayments totalled \u00a3163m in August.</p> <p>When \u00a30.3bn of spending on credit cards is added in, new unsecured borrowing amounted to \u00a31.2bn \u2013 the sharpest rise since February 2008. The figures follow positive retail sales data for the month, which showed a 0.6% increase in volumes, and news that the UK came out of recession in the third quarter of 2012.</p> <p>A \u00a30.5bn rise in mortgage lending boosted the figures.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, warned against reading too much into one month's data, but said it could be an early sign that consumers were becoming more confident about spending.</p> <p>\"The marked rise in consumer credit in September is potentially notable as consumers' appetite for taking on new borrowing has been limited for some considerable time, while there has also been an ongoing strong desire of many consumers to reduce their debt,\" he said.</p> <p>\"If consumers are becoming more prepared to spend \u2013 helped by recent healthy employment growth, lower overall inflation and an edging up in earnings growth from the lows seen earlier in 2012 \u2013 then there is a real chance the economy can continue to grow following the third-quarter rebound in GDP.\"</p> <p>But researchers Capital Economics argued the figures revealed the weak state of consumption and should ring alarm bells.</p> <p>\"The prominence of growth in consumer credit suggests that it may reflect households seeking to maintain spending in the face of continued declines in real earnings. So September's numbers may be more indicative of the economy's weakness than any resurgence in its strength,\" said UK economist Martin Beck.</p> <p>\"With continued weak earnings growth and a likely rise in unemployment, we still expect overall spending to grow by just 0.5% next year,\" he said.</p> <p>There was an increase in the number of mortgages approved in September to 94,385 from 90,023 in August. The number of loan approvals for house purchases reached 50,024, higher than the previous six-month average of 48,832, though still roughly half the long-run average of 90,000 to 95,000.</p> <p>The number of approvals for remortgaging also increased, totalling 28,343 compared to the previous six-month average of 27,664. A price war on mortgages for borrowers with 40% to put down as a deposit, combined with an increase in the standard variable rate at Santander, may have prompted borrowers to move their loans to a new rate.</p> <p>Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme launched in August may also have boosted numbers.</p> <p>\"The uptick in lending seen in September is caused by a number of factors: increased loan availability, better rates as a result of the funding for lending scheme, and increased confidence among buyers. Some more realistic pricing from vendors keen to shift stock that has been hanging around for a while is also helping,\" he said.</p> <p>Beck said funding for lending, which provides high street lenders with cheaper finance directly from the central bank, was likely to be making an impact but rates on new mortgages remain 0.27 percentage points above their level a year ago, while mortgage approvals are still about 15% below their level at the beginning of the year.</p>",

The area is low-lying and susceptible to the surge expected to impact New York later today or on Tuesday.</p> <p>Early on Monday morning, with Sandy still hundreds of miles away, it was easy to see why this area is so vulnerable. At the 8.31am high tide the Battery Park promenade - a popular tourist spot with its views of the Statue of Liberty and Governor's Island - was underwater.</p> <p>Rolling waves washed straight over the promenade wall, and by high tide water about 4 inches deep flooded the entire walkway. Not hugely dramatic just yet, but perhaps an ominous sign or what could be on store later.</p> <p>The walkway - normally packed with people jogging and cycling - was almost entirely deserted, save for a few journalists and the odd intrigued passerby.</p> <p>Mark Gluck, a professor at Rutgers University, cycles along Battery Park every morning, and wasn't about to let Sandy stop him.</p> <p>\"A bit of drizzle, a bit of wind, it's a perfectly fine day to go cycling,\" Gluck said, as water threatened to lap at his bicycle tyres. Gluck said he planned to cycle to the Upper West Side later today for lunch.

  "<p>The government was warned three years ago that the rampant disease killing Denmark's ash trees was likely to spread to Britain and devastate UK woodland but failed to act, it has emerged.</p> <p>Emails exchanged between Britain's garden industry body, the <a href=\"http://www.the-hta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Horticultural Trades Association</a>, and senior civil servants in the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra), show that the government knew about \"ash dieback\" and was asked to impose an import ban on all ash trees from Europe, but did not believe a ban was \"appropriate\".</p> <p>On Monday, the government banned imports of sh trees, with the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, saying it was warranted by a \"very serious disease that demands action to stop its spread.\" The ban comes after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/24/ash-dieback-disease-east-anglia\" title=\"\">discovery last week of trees in the wild infected by the fungus behind ash dieback</a>, <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>.</p> <p>HTA director of business development, Tim Briercliffe, said: \"Our tree and hedge group did a study tour to Denmark in 2009, touring nurseries. We spotted the disease in ash trees and we were aware that it was spreading in Denmark. It was quite clear to us we would be importing that disease if we carried on and did nothing. So we wrote to Defra asking for an import ban specifically on ash trees from Europe.</p> <p>Defra replied saying that because the disease was already endemic [in the EU] it was likely to come to the UK. They felt that controls were not appropriate.\"</p> <p>The HTA declined to make public the full correspondence with the government's Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) but said in a statement: \"The view from the plant health authorities was that the disease was already present and widespread all over Europe, including Great Britain. Countries could only take quarantine action in respect of a pest or disease which is either absent from their territory and would cause damage if introduced, or is present and under official control. On that basis, no quarantine measures were deemed appropriate.\"</p> <p>Under EU food and health rules, government could have made Britain a \"protected zone\" and stopped any ash trees being imported. But Defra's decision not to further check whether the Danish pathogen was the same as the one thought to be present in Britain suggests it either did not take the HTA experts seriously or felt that the disease would not cause serious damage.</p> <p>\"It is hugely disappointing that Defra have not acted more quickly on this issue as we first raised it with them in 2009 where the disease was seen first hand. Our advice was to ban imports then. We are looking for Defra to provide compensation for growers that have suffered as a result of this\", said Briercliffe.</p> <p>The environment minister David Heath on Monday told the Commons that 100,000 trees at 1,000 sites had now been burned to prevent the disease spreading and that the ban imposed on the movement of trees would be effective. \"We acted straight away once the disease had been identified [in March]. We are taking all the measures possible. There has been no delay. The voluntary moratorium on imports since March has worked very well.\"</p> <p>But he denied that the HTA had warned Defra specifically about the disease in 2009. \"That is not correct\", he told Caroline Lucas MP in response to a question about the origins of the disease in Britain. But he added: \"Everyone took their eye off the ball in not recognising the threat to the Danish forests.\"</p> <p>Heath said that 8,000 routine inspections of ash trees last year had not identified ash dieback and only identified 61 cases of any disease.</p> <p>Landowners, tree nurseries and environment groups today said that the ban could be too late and was not comprehensive.</p> <p>\"While we welcome the government's ban on imports, it is not enough in itself. The EU is currently developing new international legislation on invasive non-native species and this is a major opportunity to prevent future problems. The big lesson here is that sometimes, strong environmental regulation is needed to protect all our interests,\" said Martin Harper, RSPB's director of conservation.</p> <p>Country Land and Business Association president, Harry Cotterell, said: \"The ban does not appear to cover imports of ash firewood and woodchip. Moving firewood from infected areas within the UK has been banned, so we would like to know why this has not been included under the import ban.\"</p> <p>Nurseries said they face major financial losses. \"We will not now be able to sell thousands of ash trees, even though they are all grown from British seed,\" said Irene Gwillam, director of <a href=\"http://www.heathwood.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Heathwood Nurseries</a> in north Shropshire. \"Around 10% of my stock is ash. People will now be frightened to plant it.\"</p> <p>A Forestry Commission spokesman said: \"The scientific evidence available from mainland Europe in 2009 indicated that an organism called <em>Hymenoscyphus albidus</em> was the sexual stage of <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, and that it was responsible for this new form of ash dieback. It was thought at the time that this previously benign organism had become damaging for some reason, perhaps environmental change. Because this organism was widespread in Great Britain, we could not legislate to keep it out by restricting imports of ash plants.</p> <p>\"However, new evidence was published in 2011 that the telemorphic/sexual phase of C. fraxinea is in fact a previously undescribed organism, which the scientists named <em>Hymenoscyphus pseudo-albidus</em>. This organism was not known in Great Britain at the time, so we began the procedures required to pass legislation to restrict ash imports to protect GB from this organism.</p> <p>\"We did not tell the HTA in 2009 that the disease was already widespread in Great Britain; we told them the the organism which believed to be the cause of the disease was widespread in Great Britain, hence we could not legislate.\"</p>",
  "<p>Creative opportunity has an intrinsic and tangible value. Today's Britain survives and prospers by the talent of its people \u2013 it evolves through an investment in human capital that allows people to innovate, create and think anew. We develop, we come together, we see things differently and understand where others come from. This of course has benefits individually, economically, in our communities and will make us a better nation.</p> <p>Research conducted by George Land and Beth Jarman has shown that children are instinctively creative but over time lose the ability to think laterally. Much of the responsibility for this degradation of creativity lies with our education system, which decreases our crucial ability to think differently.</p> <p>Human imagination cannot be nurtured into adulthood if we encourage our children to abandon their ingenuity. We also fail to properly support creativity outside our schools, in places like colleges, universities and workplaces. This needs to change.</p> <p>Schools must build core knowledge and skills, but they must also step up personalised learning, and encourage collaborative problem solving, creativity and risk-taking. We must not abandon progress and restore an exam system from the 1950s, one that rewards the regurgitation of facts rather than creativity. We must also integrate our schools, businesses and communities in order to allow creativity in learning and unlock potential.</p> <p>We must ensure that a range of cultural stimuli are accessible to all. As Steve Jobs believed: \"Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it; they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesise new things.\" The government should maximise access to cultural stimuli \u2013 the previous Labour government's doubling of funding for the arts delivered free access to our museums and galleries.</p> <p>The Olympic Games, secured also thanks to a Labour government, reinforced Britain's global role as a force for creativity. We have seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/jul/30/olympics-richard-long-cycling-art\" title=\"\">Richard Long's Road Art</a>, Thomas Heatherwick's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/aug/06/london-2012-art-design-support-policy?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Olympic cauldron</a> and even Mr Bean playing the piano. This has reminded a worldwide audience that Britain has imagination, skill, ingenuity, creative thinking and has reinforced our own unique sense of identity and humour.</p> <p>In order to maximise this potential for the cultural sector, we need to invest in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/jul/27/research-development-fund-arts-culture?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">research and development</a>, and at the same time strengthen intellectual property law so that people do not steal the fruits of our mind. Innovation leads to groundbreaking and resourceful approaches to problems, and can be applied to any discipline or career. Innovation is rooted in our nation's psyche \u2013 from our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/oct/10/animation-future-studio-production-models?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Oscar-winning animation</a> to the Zephyr unmanned aircraft, which was conceived through collaboration between British individuals, businesses and academic institutions.</p> <p>Creativity is never just the preserve of government. We need to support designers, architects, curators, artists and scientists by listening to them. The fruits of creativity exist all around us, from the shy child growing in confidence after being part of a school orchestra or choir, to world-leading technology created through design and science. But we need active government \u2013 and politicians that understand how creativity can flourish \u2013 to allow our people every opportunity to create, innovate and inspire.</p> <p><em>Dan Jarvis MP is shadow culture minister \u2013 follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanJarvisMP\" title=\"\"><em>@DanJarvisMP</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Imagine a solid sheet of frozen water 3km across and 100m thick. Imagine it floating quietly in dark ocean waters, somewhere between Canada and Greenland. Imagine the desolation of the Arctic environment around it, getting harsher as winter approaches. The only sound comes from water lapping against the ice, and a lone seal swimming nearby. Imagine this forbidding, serene, massive place. But it really exists. This iceberg is at 69.2N, 65.6W right now, floating in peace as we all go about our busy, bustling lives filled with people and cars and telephones and decisions. It's one of the Petermann ice islands, and three months ago I&#xa0;was there, helping to study and film it for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00tvcnx\" title=\"\">BBC2's&#xa0;Operation Iceberg</a>.</p> <p>Back in the summer, things were different. This iceberg was a dynamic battleground, floodlit by 24-hour daylight. Once an iceberg is released from its parent glacier, its time is very limited. The ice is fighting a losing battle along its edges, as warm ocean water eats into it and then mini-bergs break off the weakened front. These break-up events were sudden, loud and violent. We had&#xa0;come to spectate on this oceanic siege, and to&#xa0;learn its rules. Our home was a small research ship, minuscule in comparison to the impregnable ice fortress.</p> <p>The ice edge towered over us, vertical, angular and utterly spectacular. We steamed around the berg until we found lower cliffs, and suddenly the&#xa0;icescape behind was revealed. It looked like a mini version of the South Downs, carved into ice. Gentle mounds were separated by valleys, and these led down to waterfalls of meltwater cascading into the ocean. The iceberg made its&#xa0;own fog, so we could only see a little way&#xa0;into the centre. We sailed round it, living&#xa0;life just on the wrong side of the edge,&#xa0;and peering hopefully over the top of&#xa0;the cliffs like a dog eyeing up a loaded dinner table.</p> <p>Curious polar bears peered back. We&#xa0;had&#xa0;thought we would be lucky to see one or two, but the iceberg turned out to have a healthy population of these huge carnivores. The summer is a lean time for them, as they wait for the sea ice to come back so that they can hunt. So they were snoozing away, not at all bothered that their&#xa0;chosen holiday home was moving, tilting, melting, breaking up and giving a&#xa0;TV&#xa0;production team and some scientists severe logistical headaches.</p> <p>That's how I remember the iceberg, and that's&#xa0;the side of it you'll see if you watch the programmes. But since then things have changed. We left a GPS tracker as a passenger, so we know that the iceberg has travelled 60&#xa0;miles, and is now about 30 miles south of where&#xa0;it&#xa0;was in August. It has done a few pirouettes, and only 65% of it is left. The battle has taken its&#xa0;toll. The iceberg only gets seven hours and 40&#xa0;minutes of daylight now, and soon the darkness will swallow it up completely. Since the&#xa0;supply of energy from the sun is so weak, the&#xa0;siege is over for this year. A winter respite is&#xa0;beginning.</p> <p>Sea ice is advancing towards the berg from the&#xa0;north. This is the other type of ice at the poles, formed when the sea surface itself freezes. It's fascinating stuff, because the salt is mostly squeezed out as it freezes, so sea ice is almost fresh. It starts as fragile platelets, and thickens as&#xa0;the water temperature drops. In an average year (out of the last 30 years), the sea ice would already have reached our iceberg. But this year, there was less summer sea ice in the Arctic than&#xa0;any other year on record, so it is taking longer for the great freeze to reach 69N. The sea ice is still crawling south, and when it touches the&#xa0;cliffs I saw, it will connect our iceberg to all the other ice in the Arctic. The iceberg will be frozen in place. Darkness and silence will rule. The bears will be able to walk out on to the sea ice&#xa0;and hunt again.</p> <p>In the middle of one of my typical frantic&#xa0;workdays, I enjoy imagining where&#xa0;\"our\" iceberg is now. I have a giant&#xa0;map of the world on my office wall, and it reminds me that the whole planet is&#xa0;accessible to a drop of water. After all, every ocean is connected to all other oceans. This iceberg is just ocean that has been in cold storage for a few thousand years. It is two years since it broke off from its parent glacier, and now we know it will last at least one more year as solid ice. But it will lose the battle in the end. Energy from the sun will free the water molecules and one day the last piece of solid ice will melt to a water drop.</p> <p>That drop could end up almost anywhere \u2013 as mist in a Costa Rican cloud forest, as a cup of tea&#xa0;in China, inside an Olympic athlete or in a puddle in Dorset. The coffee you're drinking as you read this could have been part of an iceberg once. And now it's going to become part of you. Isn't that fantastic?</p>",
  "<p>Scotland Yard is to examine allegations that a child sexual abuse ring was connected to a Downing Street aide.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, said on Monday the claims would be treated seriously.</p> <p>Last week the Labour MP Tom Watson used parliamentary privilege to make the allegations. It is understood they relate to a previous prime ministerial aide and not to anyone who has recently served in Downing Street.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe said a senior officer would look at the claims and that police were in contact with Watson to see if he could provide detectives with more details.</p> <p>He said they would ask the Labour MP this week \"what his sources are and if they are prepared to talk to us\" as the police assess the strength of the allegations.</p> <p>Last week Watson told MPs that a police file relating to Peter Righton, who was convicted in 1992 of importing child abuse images from the Netherlands, needed to be re-examined.</p> <p>\"The evidence file used to convict Peter Righton, if it still exists, contains clear intelligence of a widespread paedophile ring,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/24/mp-inquiry-paedophile-link-parliament\" title=\"\">Watson said during prime minister's questions</a>. \"One of its members boasts of his links to a senior aide of a former prime minister, who says he could smuggle indecent images of children from abroad.</p> <p>\"The leads were not followed up, but if the files still exist, I want to ensure that the Metropolitan police secure the evidence, re-examine it and investigate clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to parliament and No 10.\"</p> <p>Watson gave <a href=\"http://www.tom-watson.co.uk/2012/10/a-little-more-background-on-todays-pmqs\" title=\"\">more detail on his blog</a>. He said he had been contacted by a former child protection specialist who was concerned that not all of the leads the police had when investigating Righton were pursued. \"The contact, who has seen the letters, claimed that one paedophile in particular was of great concern. He said that the paedophile, who worked with children, boasted of a key aide to a former PM who could help get hold of indecent images of children,\" Watson wrote.</p> <p>The allegations come amid concern over the scale of abuse allegedly perpetrated by the radio and television presenter Jimmy Savile.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe said the police and other institutions had missed the opportunity to collate allegations against Saville. \"Organisations including the police have had individual allegations that have not been put together to actually show that this person may well have shown a pattern of behaviour that's been pretty awful,\" he said.</p> <p>He added that the allegations against Savile dated to the 1960s and spanned more than half a century. \"You might have thought that people would at least have talked about it and intervened,\" he said. \"It does look as if from time to time people have been concerned, they've made the start to intervene, but probably then they've relied a little bit too much on his reputation and his word that he did nothing.</p> <p>\"If you accept all the public accounts of the activity, then it's possibly spanned 50 years, which is a huge amount of time.\"</p> <p>The Met's Operation Yewtree <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/28/jimmy-savile-police-investigation-grew?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">is investigating claims from 300 potential victims dating back decades</a>. It became a full criminal investigation when detectives determined there could be people still alive who were allegedly involved in some of the abuse.</p> <p>On Sunday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/oct/28/gary-glitter-arrest-jimmy-savile\" title=\"\">the former pop star Gary Glitter, whose real is name Paul Gadd, became the first person to be arrested</a> as part of the operation.

  "<p>In some senses our job is similar to that of a journalist investigating and holding Guardian News and Media (GNM) to account for its actions and words. For sustainability reporting, this role is often referred to as providing assurance. We are acting as a trusted third party to reassure GNM and its stakeholders that the sustainability report is balanced and the claims it contains can be substantiated. </p> <p>We undertake our work using a set of widely recognised guidelines and requirements known as the AA1000 Assurance Standard (2008). This lays out commonly agreed expectations for how we should go about our assurance work, and it integrates with a sister standard, AA1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard, that sets out how GNM should prepare the report. The core expectations from GNM are contained in three principles that we check against:</p> <p><strong>Inclusivity</strong>: engaging with stakeholders and involving them meaningfully in GNM's sustainability approach</p> <p><strong>Materiality</strong>: identifying the most important issues to GNM and its stakeholders</p> <p><strong>Responsiveness</strong>: taking action on the most important issues and communicating those actions.</p> <p>In essence, this means checking that the right issues are covered in the report and that GNM is doing something about each of these issues. </p> <p>We also check that the information in the report is right \u2013 so we check the data and claims made about achievements and performance. If GNM says \u2013 'we are the world leader' \u2013 we want to see evidence to support this.</p> <p>We could spend our entire time checking absolutely everything and very thoroughly. In reality this would take a huge amount of resources, so we use the AA1000 Assurance Standard (2008) to guide us on how much checking to do. Our work is designed to achieve a 'moderate' level of assurance against the principles and performance information (mainly data) - this is known as 'Type 2' assurance. A moderate level means we don't check everything; we take a sampling approach, focusing on the most important issues and using our professional judgment to decide where to focus our efforts. It means that we can't say with certainty that everything is correct, although the risk that we would miss a significant error is relatively low. </p> <p>This year we checked a range of claims throughout the report. We also checked the most important performance data in the Operations, People and Targets sections of the report. </p> <p>This work involved interviews with senior management of the organisation, including board directors, at Kings Place. We independently researched what issues might be important to GNM and its stakeholders. We reviewed the report, and, having identified the claims and selected data reported, reviewed evidence to support these. We did not review the preparation of financial information reported for GNM as part of the Guardian Media Group's Annual Report.</p> <p>Web pages within our assurance scope are indicated by the 'Assured by Two Tomorrows' logo.&#xa0;In addition we may comment on individual pages posted to the sustainability website during the year.&#xa0; Where data and claims within these additional articles have been checked they include our logo and a comment.</p> <p>Responsibilities of the directors of GNM and of the assurance providers<br>The directors of GNM have sole responsibility for the preparation of the report. We were not involved in the preparation of any part of the report. Our statement represents our independent opinion and is intended to inform all of GNM stakeholders including management. We adopt a balanced approach towards all GNM stakeholders.</p> <p>Our team included Jason Perks, Mark Line, Dick Dalley, Elvin Ozensoy and Judith Murphy, selected to provide the breadth and depth of expertise needed to cover the issues. It is important that we are independent. We have advised GNM in the past on its approach to responsible paper sourcing. This role moved primarily to one of assuring the sourcing data three years ago \u2013 which we view as fully compatible with our overall assurance role. </p> <p>We confirm that we have no other work with GNM and have no relationships with significant stakeholders that might compromise our independence. We also follow our code of conduct for assurance. Details of our team's experience can be viewed on our website www.twotomorrows.com.</p> <h2>Our conclusion and observations using AA1000AS</h2> <p>Based on the work we did we have not found any evidence to suggest that the report does not properly describe GNM's adherence to the principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness. Our statements in each section of the report website provide a number of observations and recommendations. In addition some specific observations on each principle are given below:<br>Inclusivity</p> <p>GNM's Open Journalism approach clearly places stakeholders at the heart of its editorial content and commercial strategy, which we see as a leading example of inclusivity. </p> <p>We are pleased to see results from the Readers survey. It will be helpful to hear how the results of the Readers survey, showing differences between online and paper readers views, are considered as GNM continues its journey to Digital First.</p> <p>It is a positive development that an employee survey was undertaken during summer 2012 \u2013 the first since 2009. Understanding employee opinions and concerns is even more important during periods of major change so it's heartening that GNM is now committed to ongoing six monthly surveys. We look forward to the results being published once they are available. </p> <h2>Materiality</h2> <p>The report covers the majority of issues a media organisation would be expected to include.<br>This year GNM continued to strongly align the commercial strategy with editorial's open journalism approach. With this, ensuring clear rules are implemented around differentiating the editorial and commercial content becomes more material to GNM and we're pleased to see this is addressed through the revisions to the editorial Code of Conduct.<br>Given the increasing importance of freelancer writers to GNM it would be useful for the report to describe more on how this group of stakeholders are being included in the Living Our Values strategy.</p> <h2>Responsiveness</h2> <p>The report describes GNM's actions in each area of the business, focussing on the most material issues. </p> <p>GNM's coverage of key news stories that align to sustainability values continues to be a key highlight this year, as well as the way in which the coverage was developed through collaboration with stakeholders.</p> <p>Good progress was made on achieving the retained sustainability targets and we are pleased to see the number of targets has reduced to a more appropriate number to actively manage for the 2012/13 year. We recommend these action plans, and the director's objectives, move towards more quantifiable targets in future that reflect the 2015 strategy and planned KPIs.</p> <p>Last year we stated that 'The business strategy would benefit from more overtly showing how GNM is responding to sustainability questions within its digital first strategy'. The commercial sections have explained further how the Open strategy links to sustainability. There remains a need to continue to develop and explain the link between the business strategy and the sustainability strategy.</p> <h2>Performance Information</h2> <p>We checked performance claims from all report sections and data from respective sections outlined as above and where errors were identified these have been corrected. Based on the work undertaken to check the data and other performance information we have not found any evidence that GNM's performance is not properly reported.</p> <p>We used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Quality of Information Principles as Criteria for evaluating performance information.</p> <p>GNM has made further progress towards the goal of reporting comprehensive data that reflect the significant environmental impacts of the business. We have previously highlighted the lack of data about the impacts of digital publication \u2013 an area that many media organisations struggle to address and quantify. So it is particularly pleasing to see the SYMPACT project start to bear fruit with the publication of an estimated carbon footprint for the guardian.co.uk web-site. This is a difficult area to tackle and GNM deserves credit for generating some tangible numbers, albeit estimates at this stage. </p> <p>Ultimately, the goal should be to understand and quantify digital impacts, at least to the same level as GNM currently achieves for its paper publications, and then to set meaningful improvement targets. There is still a long way to go to get to this point and GNM should maintain its drive for digital sustainability, reflecting the direction that the business is taking.</p> <p>Last year, we commented on the lack of print site waste management data and so it is good to see some reported this year. At present it is not possible to give a comprehensive breakdown by waste category for each site, which would improve the clarity of reporting for next year.</p> <p>Collecting data is not an end in itself, but a means of measuring performance. Once again GNM is able to demonstrate performance improvements in energy use, water consumption and waste recycling in the areas where there is direct management control. This is a reflection of the continuing efforts of staff at the editorial offices and print sites to implement improvement initiatives day-to-day. </p> <p>Jason Perks<br>Sustainability Services Director<br>Two Tomorrows (Europe) Limited<br>London<br>October 2012</p> <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Two Tomorrows (Europe) Limited is part of DNV, a global provider of services for managing risk, helping customers to safely and responsibly improve their business performance. www.twotomorrows.com</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398529997\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/icons/2012/10/25/1351186691690/LoV_assurance_logo-001.jpg\" alt=\"LoV_assurance_logo\" width=\"460\" height=\"98\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LoV_assurance_logo Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

Economists at the World Bank estimate that the benefits of reform <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:23126181~pagePK:34370~piPK:42770~theSitePK:4607,00.html\" title=\"\">would add at least $20bn (\u00a312.45bn)</a> annually to the global economy.</p> <p>Many major retailers have sustainable seafood programmes and frequently pledge that by a certain date some or all of their seafood cases will be filled with products that are certified sustainable. But will they achieve this goal? A fish buyer for one of the world's largest retailers simply told me: \"It's not going to happen.\"</p> <p>Fisheries that have been certified over the last 10 years are primarily those fisheries that were already best managed before. The next wave of fishery improvement to feed demand in rich countries is not keeping up, and as more and more consumers demand sustainable products, the gap between supply and demand will grow.</p> <p>The hopeful news is that, with the right interventions, ocean and fishery health can rebound.</p> <p>The Prince of Wales' <a href=\"http://www.pcfisu.org/\" title=\"\">International Sustainability Unit</a> recently commissioned a set of <a href=\"http://pcfisu.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/TPC1224-Princes-Charities-case-studies-report_WEB-02.02.pdf\" title=\"\">50 global case studies</a> and among the lessons is one clear message: we know what to do in order to manage our ocean resources wisely, and good management pays. World Bank economists estimate an average 11% return on investment from fishery improvement.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.sustainablefoodlab.org/50in10\" title=\"\">50in10 collaboration </a>brings industry, finance, philanthropic, public sector and NGO partners into the design process to achieve the goal of 50% sustainable fish and fisheries in 10 years.</p> <p>Fishery management innovation has a strong track record. Fishing quotas, no-fish zones, fish stock assessments, vessel and catch tracking devices and many other building blocks of fishery management have been tested and piloted around the world. The 50in10 challenge is to build the political and organisational will to take these innovations to scale.</p> <p>Organisational collaboration is crucial. Retail and public catering businesses have a stake in a secure and growing supply of seafood. Development agencies have a stake in the financial and social resilience of coastal communities on every continent. Conservation organisations hire experts and local organisers to promote ecological health. Fishery improvement is bankable if more and higher quality seafood is harvested by a fishing industry operating at capacity.</p> <p>In spite of the virtuous feedback, most of the world's fisheries are still characterised by too many people in too many boats chasing too few fish. Only a structural reform of the economics of fishing can shift the incentives from a tragedy of the commons to co-operation, motivated by a shared economic stake in the health of the resource base.</p> <p>Co-operation and collaboration are not easy or natural, however. Not only fishermen but also the most public-spirited NGOs compete with one another.</p> <p>The third domain of innovation, therefore, is individual leadership. Fishers and regulators, buyers and conservationists can learn to see the world through one another's eyes and achieve results together that they can't achieve by acting independently.</p> <p>Next week from 5 November, a 'design workshop' for the 50in10 collaboration will gather people from about 30 organisations around the world.</p> <p>One representative recently said: \"I've been in this industry for a long time, both with business and NGOs. I believe it shouldn't be that difficult to get to 50% sustainable supply in 10 years, or have 50% of marine resources be sustainable. We can probably turn them around fairly quickly with a concerted effort from all parties involved.\"</p> <p>On how it might work, another representative suggested: \"Collaboration works when you have a group of people who trust each other. That's the most important point. Then comes expertise. Then comes having the ability to actually make a difference with a specific project.\"</p> <p>Yet another said: \"This is the biggest opportunity in the global conservation effort I've seen in my career to boost economic development and food security while preserving the natural resources on which we depend.\"</p> <p><em>Hal Hamilton is founder and co-director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.sustainablefoodlab.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Sustainable Food Lab </em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"More from Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

The streets are packed with traffic as people unwind from a hard week's work. The police are hard at work too.</p> <p>They pull over a huge SUV, driving at speed up a major road. As the car comes to a stop, the driver almost mounts the kerb. He staggers as he steps out of the car, his face ruddy from the beer he's been drinking. For Mexico City's <em>alcohol\u00edmetro</em> police, Friday nights keep their breathalysers busy.</p> <p>\"Sadly, people don't know how to be responsible drivers\", <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/oct/05/drink-driving-mexico-road-safety-video\" title=\"\">says police officer Diana Gonzales</a> (video). \"They know they have consumed alcohol. But despite the fact we've been doing this for nine years here in Mexico City, people still aren't used to handing their car over to someone else who hasn't drunk alcohol.\"</p> <p>Although it rarely makes the headlines, more Mexicans have been killed on the roads than have died in the country's violent drug wars. Since 2006, an average of 16,700 people have been killed every year in road traffic accidents. The statistic places Mexico in the top 10 most dangerous countries in the world for road traffic deaths; it has the second highest death rates in Latin America, behind Argentina.</p> <p>So why, in a country with a relatively developed road network and a raft of road safety legislation measures in place, are so many people dying? Drink driving is a major factor, says Roy Rojas, the national co-ordinator for road safety for the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/roadsafety/decade_of_action/en/\" title=\"\">World Health Organisation</a> in Mexico. He says there is no social shame in getting caught over the limit while driving. According to the roadside police working their breathalysers, prosecutions for drink driving remain rare, so drivers continue to drink and drive with impunity.</p> <p>An even bigger risk on the roads is that only half the country's states have any kind of driving test system. Public transport workers aside, licences are therefore granted without any proof people can drive.</p> <p>Nor can Mexico fall back on the excuse that it lacks resources. \"Mexico City has the most pedestrian footbridges in the world,\" says Rojas. \"However, they are also the least used. Around half of all road deaths are pedestrians.\"</p> <p>Neither does Mexico lack road safety legislation. There are ample laws in place at federal, state and municipal levels that prohibit, for instance, the use of mobile phones while driving and failure to use seatbelts. People simply ignore the rules, which are rarely enforced by police and law enforcement agencies.</p> <p>All of this is compounded by the migration of people from rural areas who are unaccustomed to driving in densely populated cities where the movement of traffic is faster and more furious. According to Rojas, there is no link between literacy levels and driving skill; if anything, better-educated people tend to be more aggressive drivers, he says.</p> <p>But it's not all bad news. Mexico has experienced an improvement in road safety in the past two years, with the issue moving up the public policy agenda. \"There is now a trend towards vigilance. This is no longer a silent epidemic \u2013 now it's more out in the open,\" says Rojas.</p> <p>Despite its bad road safety record, deaths are stabilising year on year rather than rising, in part because federal and state authorities are increasingly working together to tackle the problem.</p> <p>Schemes such as Mexico City's <em>alcohol\u00edmetro</em> are also playing a part. The programme is viewed as pioneering by many other Mexican states. It is slowly seeding the idea that driving drunk is a crime and that there are repercussions for those who drink and then get behind the wheel. According to official figures from Mexico City's public security secretary, the presence of the <em>alcohol\u00edmetro</em> has reduced drink-driving accidents by 30% since it was launched in 2003.</p> <p>Gonzales, the police officer on the Friday night breathalyser beat, says drink driving has gone down since she started working the <em>alcohol\u00edmetro</em> three years ago. \"It's not the majority of people [who are over the limit] like before,\" she says.</p> <p>Still, Gonzales has her work cut out. In Mexico, cutting dangerous driving on the roads remains a battle that costs the country thousands of lives each year.</p>",
  "<p>With the lines between paid, earned, and owned media becoming blurred, it's crucial for marketers to find more cost-effective and coherent means of engaging with consumers.</p> <p>As a result, content marketing has quickly become a key part of any organisation's marketing mix, and, according to recent research, is being used by <a href=\"http://www.contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/B2B_Content_Marketing_2012.pdf\" title=\"\">nine out of 10 marketers</a>. So what exactly is it, and what is the opportunity for strengthening your media strategy?</p> <h2>The new marketing ecosystem</h2> <p>Marketers traditionally think of media strategy in terms of three distinct channels: paid, owned, and earned media. But the lines between these are becoming less defined as earned media becomes increasingly important: that is, media that can't be bought or controlled by a company itself, generated independently by consumers and third parties \u2013 anything from social media to word-of-mouth. And the value of earned media will continue to rise with consumers increasingly looking to non-traditional media outlets for content, seeking out what they're interested in, rather than passively receiving whatever comes their way from media companies.</p> <p>Content marketing is proving its capacity to generate earned media, build brands and increase social interactions by giving customers the highly engaging content they crave.</p> <h2>What is the content marketing opportunity with video?</h2> <p>Video plays a key role in content marketing through its ability to attract and sustain consumers'</p> <p>attention. It lends itself to social sharing and is an unmatched medium for telling stories, conveying information and triggering an emotional response. Coupled with the power of social media, marketers can use video to more closely integrate their strategies for paid, owned and earned media to increase impact and ROI:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Reach: generating awareness and attention.</strong> According to <a href=\"http://blogs.forrester.com/interactive_marketing/2009/01/the-easiest-way.html\" title=\"\">Forrester Research</a>, videos are 53 times more likely than text pages to appear on the first page of search results. Maximise on this potential with a metadata strategy focusing on the keywords most relevant to the community you're targeting for SEO and website traffic. Social media provides a powerful multiplier effect in terms of reach. YouTube, for example, attracts 157 million unique viewers per month.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Acquisition: promoting product education.</strong> One of the guiding principles of content marketing is that consumers value relevant, engaging content that addresses their needs and interests. As a result, brands are launching their own online video portals to provide deep product information, demonstrations, how-to advice, personalised content and special offers.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Engagement: drawing people closer to your brand.</strong> Compelling video not only attracts visitors to a website, it helps keep them there. Vivid storytelling and deep information focus viewers' attention and entice them to watch additional videos. As their time on-site grows, they remain within the branded environment and available for further messaging and offers.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Retention and loyalty.</strong> Post-sale content and video-based support help keep your customer relationships active and valuable. Integrated into your social media presence, online video gives customers another reason to \"like\" your brand, as they regularly receive useful information in their feed. What's more, the popularity, \"virality\", and emotional impact of online video makes it highly effective for turning customers into loyal fans and brand advocates.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Conversion: turning prospects into customers.</strong> Product videos and demos give a rich, intuitive sense of a product that a web page or data sheet can't match, giving customers more confidence about their purchasing decision and lowering the number of abandoned shopping carts. In-player calls to action, interactive offers, and buy-now buttons help capitalise immediately and seamlessly on purchase intent while it's still fresh in the customer's mind.</p> <p>A compelling example of the power of video in content marketing is UK retailer Marks &amp; Spencer, which has implemented \"shoppable video\" to its sites featuring in-player calls-to-action for access to further product videos and information, as well as for reaching the corresponding e-commerce page. M&amp;S videos also retain this functionality when shared on Facebook \u2013 a perfect example of how earned media can be converted into a viral e-commerce outlet. As a direct result of this content marketing strategy, M&amp;S has enjoyed sales increases on some products by as much as 90%. This is proof positive of how marketers are achieving proven results and ultimately growing their business with content marketing by providing authentic and engaging content.</p> <p>Changes in both the digital landscape and consumer behaviour have created powerful new opportunities to gain and sustain consumer attention through the right content marketing strategies. By leveraging social media and online video across the full range of connected devices, marketers can make paid, owned and earned media strategies more closely integrated and effective at every stage of the customer lifecycle.</p> <p><em>Robert Raiola is EMEA senior marketing director at Brightcove.</em></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, s</strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>ign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian Media Network.

  "<p>The British public are being asked to use their phones to help save the country's 80 million ash trees from a devastating disease that has already affected millions of trees on the continent and has led to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/26/ash-dieback-imports-banned\" title=\"\">a ban on imports coming into force today</a>.</p> <p>Ash dieback, caused by the fungus <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/24/ash-dieback-disease-east-anglia\" title=\"\">was last week found in the UK for the first time</a> outside of plantations and nurseries in East Anglia, raising fears of a repeat of Dutch elm disease which killed 25 million mature elms in the 1970s and 80s.</p> <p>In an attempt to map and help prevent the spread of the disease across the country, a team of developers and academics worked through the weekend to create an app that smartphone owners can use to report suspected cases of infection.</p> <p>Infected ash trees are recognisable by lesions on their bark, dieback of leaves at the tree's crown, and leaves turning brown \u2013 though experts say the arrival of autumn makes the latter harder to accurately spot.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://ashtag.org/\" title=\"\">AshTag</a> app for IOS and Android devices allows users to submit photos and locations of sightings to a team who will refer them on to the Forestry Commission, which is leading efforts to stop the disease's spread with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).</p> <p>The app follows in the footsteps of similar citizen-science crowdsourcing apps for wildlife, such as <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pooter!/id426349821?mt=8\" title=\"\">Pooter!</a> for mapping the distribution of bees, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/20/smartphone-endangered-cicada-detector\" title=\"\">an imminent app for discovering whether a species of cicada in the New Forest</a> have gone extinct or not. But its creators stressed what was unusual was the speed and urgency with which it had been created.</p> <p>\"Time is really of the essence, and we're hoping that Apple will support us in rushing any updates through the App store,\" said Toby Hammond, one of the team behind the app at the Adapt Low Carbon Group at the University of East Anglia. \"As a child growing up in Norfolk I was well aware of the devastation wreaked by the Dutch elm disease. We hope that thousands of people, from school groups to dog walkers, will use the app help to spot and report any sightings of the ash dieback so the disease can be contained.\"</p> <p>He added that he hoped the technology involved would help avoid the Forestry Commission being \"overwhelmed\" by false reports of just \"brown leaves.\"</p> <p>Ren\u00e9 Olivieri, chair of the Wildlife Trusts, which look after dozens of nature reserves around the country, has joined with the Woodland Trust in calling on the government to convene an emergency summit to discuss halting the spread of ash dieback, and other tree diseases.</p> <p>A Woodland Trust spokeswoman said it was still not clear whether last week's incident of the fungus in the wild had come from imports or carried over from the continent by the wind. \"We feel they're isolated cases. The sites are in East Anglia and near the coast, so the disease could have come in on the wind or even migrating birds across the North Sea. But we don't know yet.\"</p> <p>Defra's chief scientist, Prof Ian Boyd, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/28/ash-dieback-fungus-change-countryside?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">said of ash dieback at the weekend</a> : \"Ecologically it is going to change the countryside very significantly. Parallels have been made with Dutch elm disease of the 1970s. This is not good news for the countryside.\"</p> <p>The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121025/debtext/121025-0001.htm#12102523000344\" title=\"\">said last Thursday</a> that the government would ban imports from Monday, and visited a wood in Staffordshire to officially announce the ban, which the gardening trade body, conservationists and others have been demanding for months.</p> <p>Announcing the ban today, he said: \"This is a very serious disease that demands action to stop its spread. I have ordered both an import ban and movement restrictions on trees from infected areas. This comes into force immediately.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 8 November. The main text said that 90% of trees in Denmark had been \"wiped out\". This is incorrect and has been changed to \"affected\". </p>",
  "<p>Getting to know the intricacies of a new university has its challenges \u2013 doing it for two at the same time, when they are almost exactly antipodian to each other, seems foolhardy. Yet in July I was offered my dream position, that of joint academic vice-president of two great universities, <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">the University of Warwick</a> in the UK and <a href=\"http://www.monash.edu.au/\" title=\"\">Monash University</a> in Australia. The role is to lead their cross-border, indeed world-spanning, <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/about/partnerships/monash/\" title=\"\">Monash-Warwick Alliance</a>. It is both an exciting challenge and an enormous opportunity.</p> <p>To paraphrase a memorable and possibly apocryphal George W-ism, \"The world is getting more global\", and that is as true for higher education and research as it is for any industry. And yet there has been little or no globalisation in how we organize ourselves; no global entity runs viable universities in multiple countries and no truly transnational offering for students and academics exists. Yes, there are outposts of universities in China, South East Asia and the Middle East. Does this in itself create a truly global university?</p> <p>As we see it, Warwick and Monash are doing much more. We seek to be a globally integrated university alliance; not a loose affiliation of some dozen or more universities, but a tight, yet broad, partnership between two proud universities who will co-develop courses, co-invest in technologies and attract the best researchers who want access to the best facilities \u2013 and the best students too.</p> <p>Both universities are embedded within their home countries but together they now offer a connected experience to students wherever they come from in the world. Those students will be able to do a course made up of components from either institution, experiencing learning from Europe and/or the Asia-Pacific, and become globally aware and culturally adept graduates. We hope also to appeal to researchers of laboratories running simultaneously on either side of the world, to PhD students from both continents, and to support and research funding sources in more than one system.</p> <p>Why and how? The why is simple. Our websites state it clearly: \"A key aim of the alliance is to help meet the increasing student, industry and government demand for universities to produce graduates with a global education, and to undertake research that addresses world-relevant and strategically important problems.\"</p> <p>We know (and governments understand) that global challenges will not be solved by parochial thinking or small groups using the approaches they have always used. It will require bigger collaborations, transnational partnerships and a degree of inter-disciplinarity that has proved so difficult to foster within single institutions. To have even a chance to do that we need the best globally aware academics and students, those who feel Beijing, New York or Singapore are as likely to offer an answer \u2013 or the right person to work with \u2013 as the UK or Australia. These people know that time-zone and distance barriers merely mean Skype rather than coffee together.</p> <p>Why Warwick and Monash? Both are aggressively ambitious children of the 1960s, the baby boomers of higher education. Both have risen quickly in their home markets and seek a way to keep that rate of growth going and challenge historical elites. That will not happen by incremental growth; it requires disruptive innovative thinking. Industry and philanthropists, government and the populace all expect us to work together. We aim to make the system encourage and support this, rather than block it.</p> <p>We enjoy breaking down barriers. Why not find a way for the two HR systems to work together to find the best employment solution for the 30 planned senior professorial posts? They have already done it for my own post \u2013 and there are more to come. How will the universities provide for governance and academic leadership below the level of the two vice-chancellors and presidents? That is my role, and I wouldn't have taken it on if I hadn't seen the commitment of dedicated staff in both universities already taking to Skype, Facetime, instant messaging, Jabber and DropBox as if they were teenagers.</p> <p>Lastly I am asked: how will the alliance get students involved? And how will joint teaching work? These may be the ultimate examples of challenges that turn out to be opportunities. Both student bodies are hungry to create ways to serve their members better and more creatively, and students themselves are already finding solutions such as launching <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/warwick-monash_global_undergraduate\" title=\"\">the joint undergraduate research journal, Reinvention</a>.</p> <p>Markers of success are already coming in. Funders are backing the idea with hard cash: \u00a3500,000 from the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under its <a href=\"http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/calls/2012/Pages/globalengagementsinresearch.aspx\" title=\"\">Building Global Engagements programme</a> to build connections in the physical sciences; \u00a366,000 from the Australian government to support student mobility; and \u00a3200,000 from the Australian Research Council grant to build collaborations in engineering.

  "<p>In recent weeks a slew of stories has hit the news about the soaring price of food, petrol and household energy \u2013 and the financial pressure this is putting on cash-strapped households. But as politicians scrabble around for the best short-term fix, a fundamental cause underpinning much of these economic woes is often overlooked. Under the bonnet, there's something big going on: we're damaging the planet and draining its resources, and it's starting to cost us big time.</p> <p>With growing confidence scientists <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/10/food-price-rise-uk-crop-harvest\" title=\"\">are linking climate change to the increasingly freakish weather around the globe</a> which is causing food prices to rise. Earlier this month the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/10/food-prices-rise-wettest-summer\" title=\"\">National Farmers' Union predicted</a> more price rises when it revealed that wet weather had cut UK wheat yields by 15%.</p> <p>Natural resources are not infinite and with developing economies growing fast, we're beginning to discover that there are not enough to go round. You only have to look at your energy bills to see the predictable effect this all has. According to energy regulator Ofgem, our gas and electricity bills have sharply risen principally because of the rocketing price of fossil fuels, driven by international demand. In 2011 the price of natural gas was the biggest cause of increases in domestic energy bills, which were somewhere in the region of \u00a3200.</p> <p>And it's the same story with oil prices: up, up, up, with all that entails when you fill your car at the pump. All of this hits the poorest hardest, with more than 5m households now in fuel poverty, and \"transport poverty\" \u2013 where people cannot afford to travel and so struggle to find work or access services - a stark and growing problem.</p> <p>But faced with all the evidence, no one on the political scene is showing the kind of leadership required. They prefer to squabble about short-term sticking-plaster policies, like the perennial scrap about a few pence on or off fuel duty. David Cameron <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/18/cameron-energy-department-explain-tariff\" title=\"\">recently got into lots of bother on the issue of unfair energy tariffs</a> which, while not a trivial nut to crack, is a sideshow to the real economics of bill rises.</p> <p>The biggest problem is the chancellor, who doesn't seem to understand that in the long term you simply can't have a healthy economy without a healthy environment. By pitting the two against each other, he ignores not just the CBI \u2013 which says green and growth must go together \u2013 but cold, hard, economic reality. In claiming, contrary to the evidence, that \"gas is cheap\", George Osborne has become a modern day King Cnut, attempting to turn back the tide of evidence on the rising price of gas by flat out denying it \u2013 and, indeed, pushing to keep the economy hooked on the stuff. This is especially galling from a man who reportedly accuses environmental advocates of acting like the Taliban. If anything it's Osborne, with his reckless dash for gas, who wants to keep us in the dark ages.</p> <p>The writing has been on the wall for years \u2013 indeed some enlightened parts of the business community have even helped write it. It's more than a decade since <a href=\"http://www.abi.org.uk/Media/Releases/2000/10/ABI_publishes_research_on_potential_risks_of_inland_flooding.aspx\" title=\"\">the Association of British Insurers warned</a> of the impact of more frequent and more severe flooding as a result of climate change.</p> <p>In 2006 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk\" title=\"\">the review into the economics of climate change by former World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern</a> convinced Tony Blair of the sound economic case for action. This was hinged on the central argument that it will be cheaper to prevent climate change than to deal with its costs and impacts, which also fall disproportionately on the least well-off. We're now seeing the very beginnings of what Lord Stern was getting at.</p> <p>A broad church of organisations, all with a stake in wishing to avoid economic mayhem and keen to see a green-powered economic recovery, now gets that green is working: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/18/protest-george-osborne-green-economy\" title=\"\">manufacturers, unions, businesses, consumer groups, faith groups, and poverty campaigners</a>.

  "<p>If there's one thing that the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/29/san-francisco-giants-win-world-series\">San Francisco Giants' four-game sweep of the Detroit Tigers in the 2012 World Series</a> proves, it's that you should never, ever listen to baseball writers (with the possible exception of this sentence). The Tigers were the heavy favorites going into Game 1 of the World Series and very few writers were predicting that the Giants could put away a team with arguably the best hitter and probably the best pitcher in baseball, in four games, including back-to-back shutouts. Outcomes like this October's just highlight that the only true thing in sports is that ancient aphorism, \"that's why they play the games\".</p> <p>For instance, look at the prediction<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/24/world-series-tigers-giants-everything-you-need-to-know\"> that some hack named Hunter Felt made in some rag called the Guardian</a>. In his blogpost, Felt predicts that the Tigers will win the World Series in six games. In retrospect, his reasoning seems laughable. He begins by analyzing the starting pitching and claiming that the Tigers have the clear edge because they have reigning MVP/Cy Young winner Justin Verlander \"available for at least two games of this series\"... assuming the Tigers would stay alive long enough to see a Game 5. In addition, Felt mocks the first World Series game's matchup and cites it as the main reason San Francisco's starting rotation can't compare: \"Advantage: Tigers. Justin Verlander starts Game 1 for the Tigers. Barry Zito and his magic pixie dust start for the Giants\".</p> <p>Apparently Zito's pixie dust is some high-quality stuff. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/25/detroit-tigers-san-francisco-giants-world-series-game-1-live\">Game 1 of the World Series ended up being a lop-sided affair</a>, but in the opposite way from how most expected. Zito, the once Cy Young winner who has fallen on Dickensian hard times of late, went 5 1/3 scoreless innings to pick up the win. Verlander, thanks partly to giving up home runs to the Giants' Pablo Sandoval in two straight plate appearances, ended up taking the loss by pitching his worst game in the playoffs, giving up five runs in four innings of work. The hard-throwing Verlander found himself shown up by a guy whose repertoire might have been improved stuff-wise with an eephus pitch and a knuckleball. Somewhere, Bill \"Spaceman\" Lee was watching Zito with a smile, plotting a comeback.</p> <p>This doofus Felt continues by comparing the Giants offense with that of the Tigers and finding it lacking, going out of his way to praise Prince Fielder: \"Advantage: Tigers. By quite a bit, honestly.\" Fielder went on to play the Alex Rodriguez role in the World Series, his struggles at the plate being a key reason why the Tigers could not score in either <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/26/detroit-tigers-san-francisco-giants-world-series-game-2-live\">Game 2</a> or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2012/oct/28/san-francisco-giants-detroit-tigers-world-series-live-game-3\">Game 3</a>. Meanwhile, the Giants' Sandoval, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/25/pablo-sandoval-world-series-three-home-runs\">who hit a World Series record-tying three home runs in the first game,</a> is dismissed with a mild joke comparing his weight to Miguel Cabrera's and a reiteration of his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwVR-LiCQxw\">Jack Black cartoon-inspired</a> nickname. There are certainly no comparisons to Reggie Jackson or Albert Pujols there.</p> <p>To give Past Hunter his due, he does give the Giants an edge as far as their defense and bullpen go, although he seems to underestimate the impact they would have on the series. The Giants had Santiago Casilla and Sergio Romo in their bullpen in a series where every game but the first was close, while the Tigers had Phil Coke and then Jim Leyland's desperate, tobacco-ravaged prayer-croaks to the Baseball Gods. The Tigers had to stick defensive and cultural liability Delmon Young in the outfield while the Giants had Gregor Blanco making <a href=\"http://www.footbasket.com/2012/10/25/gregor-blanco-gets-amazing-diving-catches-in-game-1/\">highlight-reel catches</a>.</p> <p>Maybe no one could have predicted that Verlander and Fielder would be liabilities for Detroit but since when do relief pitching and defense not play major roles in a seven-game series? In fact, the bullpens were the difference in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/28/san-francisco-giants-detroit-tigers-world-series-game-4-live\">in the decisive Game 4</a> when Coke, who replaced Jose Valverde as closer in the middle of the postseason after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/detroit-tigers-new-york-yankees-alcs-game-1-live\">Valverde pulled a Valverde one too many times</a>, allowed a run-scoring single to Marco Scutaro with two outs in the top of the 10th. After Coke allowed the winning run to score, Giants closer Romo came out in the bottom of the 10th and froze Triple Crown winner Cabrera for a called strike three for the last out of the 2012 MLB season. </p> <p>Also, in Old Me's defense, he \u2013 or I, or whoever, this conceit is starting to get confusing \u2013 wasn't alone in his poor predictions. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8544168/espn-expert-predictions\">A list of 28 ESPN experts' World Series predictions</a> shows that only five selected the Giants as World Series champions, and none of them predicted they would win in less than six games (it should be noted that <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5954600/grantlands-jonah-keri-picks-the-giants-in-seven-espns-jonah-keri-likes-the-tigers-in-five\">Grantland's Jonah Keri hedged his bets</a>). Some of the comments are almost sitcom-obvious in their dramatic irony. Matthew Berry's reason for picking the Tigers? \"I don't trust the Giants rotation. I do trust the Tigers offense.\" Richard Durrett adds: \"I'll stick with Justin Verlander, Miguel Cabrera, Prince Fielder.\" Even, Sports Illustrated's Joe Lemire's thoughtful, numbers-based analysis led him to <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/joe_lemire/10/23/world-series-preview-tigers-giants/index.html\"> pick Tigers in six</a>. It seemed to make sense at the time.</p> <p>Maybe the Detroit Tigers were the superior team in the grander scheme of things, but that simply didn't matter in the end. The Tigers weren't the better team in the series, the San Francisco Giants were \u2013 \"by quite a bit, honestly\" \u2013 and that's all that mattered. Pit Zito against Verlander 100 games in a row and Verlander wins 93 or 94 times. This just happened to be one of the universes where one of the six or seven other games happened. </p> <p>Maybe there's a world where Miguel Cabrera crushes Giants closer Sergio Romo's last pitch of the game for a home run, the Tigers win Game 4 and Detroit stays alive and stages an epic comeback. Maybe there's a world where the Tigers offense hits with runners in scoring position in Games 2 or 3 rather than hitting into double-plays. Maybe past me and others were right and that in the sum total of all the possibilities, \"Tigers in Six\" was the most common outcome but that ended up meaning nothing. </p> <p>In reality, the San Francisco Giants outplayed the Detroit Tigers in every facet of the game and rightfully swept them. That's the beautiful part of baseball: the probable eventually gives way to the actual. I miss it already.</p>",
  "<p>This week (31 October to 2 November) David Cameron will host the first in-depth meeting of the UN High Level Panel in London \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/24/un-panel-development-goals-ambitious-timetable?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">a group of the great and the good who will map out</a> what might replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) post 2015.</p> <p>Quite rightly, the team have identified jobs and growth as one of the key areas they want to look into. Finding ways to ensure that this growth becomes truly inclusive, and empowers poor and marginalised people to demand their fair share, is something we at Care International are particularly engaged in and why we want to explore the role that business can play in development.</p> <p><strong>Not on the agenda</strong></p> <p>Back in 2000 when the original set of targets were drawn up, the role that business could play in lifting people out of poverty didn't feature. This time around all are agreed it should, but working out how is not proving easy.</p> <p>Harvard Business School estimates that out of the 82,000 multinational companies out there, only 3,000 or so are exploring inclusive models. And while some industry leaders are emerging (Unilever's chief executive, Paul Polman, is a member of the UN Panel), globally, this approach is still small fry.</p> <p>For those of us that believe in the potential that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive_business\" title=\"\">inclusive business models have to offer</a> to development, the MDG moment seems an opportunity not to be missed. Given the economic mess we're all in today, we clearly don't need just another nudge \u2013 we need a complete rethink.</p> <p>But what could any new agreement actually urge business to do? And is it time to wield the carrot or the stick to urge more companies \u2013 large and small to adopt inclusive ways of working?</p> <p>Sticks have been the more commonly adopted tactic over recent years. A plethora of standards currently exist to try and hold companies to account but these have nearly all been voluntary, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/07/development-community-beware-corporates-bearing-gifts\" title=\"\">resemble feeble twigs rather</a> than menacing threats. They include the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oecd.org%2Fdepartment%2F0%2C2688%2Cen_2649_34889_1_1_1_1_1%2C00.html&amp;ei=PleOUL3ZO8y1hAeJ14CACQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQdAKvQbJECOmBeAyignLRTtuQBA\" title=\"\">OECD guidelines on multinational companies</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.voluntaryprinciples.org%2Ffiles%2Fvoluntary_principles_english.pdf&amp;ei=9laOUL6hMIuyhAfti4GoBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFofw_8Ucy9AbF8C7cZsnQTK8NJQA\" title=\"\">voluntary principles on security and human rights</a>, the extractive industry transparency initiative, the <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/lang--en/index.htm\" title=\"\">International Labour Organisation's standards on labour rights</a> and the UN Global Compact \u2013 to name a few.</p> <p>While some of these have led to increased reporting and dialogue, most would argue that they need to be mandatory if they are to have any teeth (and that they need to be all brought under one roof).</p> <p>Professor John Ruggie, the UN special representative on business and human rights between 2005-11, spent years trying to navigate this conundrum. Knowing that early attempts to make mandatory standards didn't fly, he came out with a set of principles that clearly articulated the roles and responsibilities of the state and companies, under international human rights law. Essentially, it's up to the state to regulate its private sector.</p> <p>The MDGs could request companies to report on their activities and the positive impact they are having, rather than simply listing how their CSR projects have contributed to various MDGs, as some do now.</p> <p><strong>Building a model for inclusive business</strong></p> <p>So what about the carrots? Should states consider how to incentivise companies to adopt inclusive models? Could the MDGs urge all states to create enabling environments for those companies that commit to making a positive impact? This could even include tax breaks. Or, could the standard bearers that are out there put their weight behind developing the <a href=\"http://www.ftse.com/Indices/FTSE4Good_Index_Series/index.jsp\" title=\"\">FTSE4Good</a>, where companies competed against each other to be the best inclusive business?</p> <p>Much of the success on inclusive business has happened when companies themselves have realised the economic, reputational and sustainable benefits. Polman says business \"will have to see itself as part of society, not separate from it. And it will have to recognise that the needs of citizens and communities carry the same weight as the demands of shareholders.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the MDGs should focus on putting in place building blocks that will enable more partnerships and social enterprises to flourish. Could the existing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/aug/05/millennium-development-goal-global-partnership\" title=\"\">goal eight on developing partnerships</a> (which has always been a damp squib), be turned into a national compact \u2013 a body of governments, business and civil society representatives that monitor progress and co-create new approaches to tackling development in their countries?</p> <p>We need to know where financial inclusion fit into all of this. Financial inclusion was also absent from the first set of MDGs. It may seem like the buzz phrase of the moment, but whether you are a poor producer, consumer, or worker, access to savings and credit are vital for stabilising household expenditure. Yet 2.5 billion people remain without access to a bank account and are therefore excluded from modern economic life as we know it.</p> <p><strong>Building the evidence of success</strong></p> <p>Clearly more thinking needs to happen, but undoubtedly the role of business must be on the agenda. In the meantime Care continues to believe that we have a responsibility to find ways of maximizing the positive impact the private sector has on poverty. We will continue to pilot the successful models we have developed with business and build the evidence base for what has worked.</p> <p>For example, we are currently discussing how we can take our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/markets-empower-women-not-repress\" title=\"\">rural sales enterprise in Bangladesh</a> to scale at a national and international level and we recently extended our partnership with Barclays and Plan to equip a further 330,000 disadvantaged young people (in addition to the 490,000 already reached) to foster savings and increase inclusion in the formal financial system among the world's poorest people.</p> <p><em>Alice Hutchinson is head of advocacy at </em><a href=\"http://www.careinternational.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Care International UK</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Dear Hilary and Caroline,</p> <p>I am writing to ask why you failed to ban imports of ash seedlings and saplings from continental Europe into the United Kingdom, when it has been clear for several years that the species was widely infected on the Continent with ash dieback (<em>Chalara fraxinea</em>).</p> <p>You are both said \u2013 by people who worked with you and others who know you well \u2013 to have taken your brief as secretaries of state for the environment seriously. Yet it now emerges that there were repeated warnings from experts about the spread and gravity of the disease, and that European ecologists \u2013 as well as British foresters and conservationists \u2013 were begging the UK government to take all necessary measures to prevent the fungus from arriving here, so that there would at least be one uninfected redoubt.</p> <p>Am I wrong in thinking that you ignored their warnings? If so, could you show me what action you took to prevent the disease from arriving here?</p> <p>Owen Paterson, the current secretary of state, is being held responsible for the problem. But by the time he took charge of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), it was too late. All he could do was to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/oct/25/ash-dieback-cameron\" title=\"\">shut the stable door after the horse had bolted</a>. I believe that politicians will not take the long-term consequences of their decisions seriously unless they are held to account for them. Political short-termism is one of the natural world\u2019s greatest threats.</p> <p>So, though neither of you are now in government, I think you both have some explaining to do: quite a lot of explaining, in fact. If <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/28/ash-dieback-fungus-change-countryside\" title=\"\">ash dieback is now spreading across Britain</a> as a result of your combined inaction, you carry responsibility for causing one of the greatest environmental crises ever to have struck this country: a profound loss that will be felt by everyone who loves the natural world.</p> <p>I would be grateful if you could tell me what happened - or what didn\u2019t. Why did you fail to ban imports of live ash trees and to take other measures necessary to prevent the arrival of the disease? Was it an obsession with free trade at any cost? Was it a desire not to be seen to be \u201canti-business\u201d by regulating corporate activity, however strong the case for so doing? Was it the lack of political incentives, as very few people outside government were aware of the danger, which meant that the political cost of inaction was low?</p> <p>Why did you fail to alert parliament and the public to the danger? I have checked the parliamentary record, and found that not a word has been said there, in any forum, about the disease before 11 October 2012. There is <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/pb13784-tree-health-progress-report.pdf\" title=\"\">a single mention of the pathogen before October 2012 on the Defra website</a>. A progress report on plant biosecurity published in July 2012 notes that, at an unspecified date, but presumably during the previous winter,</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cFera [the Food and Environment Research Agency] made a significant interception of <em>Chalara faxinea</em> [sic] on ash plants imported from the Netherlands and followed this up with FC [Forestry Commission] providing assistance in the form of disease recognition.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, Caroline, your department was aware that infected seedlings were arriving in this country and that officials did not possess the expertise required to spot them. Yet you still allowed imports to continue. What were you thinking? Where were the urgent warnings, the urgent action required to defend this country from a pressing threat?</p> <p>Those of us who are now dreading the likely outcome of the disease, and wondering how, in the information age, we could have been kept in the dark about it by the department you ran, would dearly like some answers. I undertake to publish them as soon as they are received.</p> <p>Thank you.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,</p> <p>George Monbiot</p> <h2>On Thursday 15 November 2012, Caroline Spelman wrote:</h2> <p>Dear Mr Monbiot,</p> <p>It is clear from the Hansard of yesterday\u2019s debate that neither Hilary Benn nor I were shown the letter from the HTA to the Forestry Commission of 2009. The reason ash was not banned from import was that the scientists thought the fungus was endemic. This was a disastrous case of misdiagnosis. It is not that the budget for tree health was cut. The reverse is true. I allocated extra money on top of its budget which was protected in the spending review.</p> <p>Other diseases were prioritised by the Forestry Commission on the basis of scientific advice and a Tree Health and Biosecurity Action Plan was launched in 2011 with \u00a38m of extra funds. As soon as the first case was confirmed an unprecedented search for more cases was undertaken resulting in 100,000 ash trees being felled and a voluntary ban on imports pending consultation on a formal ban not that ask tress are imported in the summer. So there was no delay, no complacency once the disease was found to be here.</p> <p>You have done me a disservice to imply motives such as the quest for free trade which is at odds with the fact I published the Tree Health and Biodiversity Action Plan in 2011 with additional funds of which you make no mention. Hilary and I certainly did take the environment seriously and essentially received the same advice on ash dieback. Once that advice changed I acted upon it and Owen has taken this work forward bringing in a formal ban and speeding up the measures in my action plan.</p> <p>Please see the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121112/debtext/121112-0002.htm#12111213000001\">Hansard report of yesterday\u2019s debate</a> where you will see I called for reform of the EU plant health regime.</p> <p>Caroline</p>",
  "<p>In ancient China, the arrival of a new dynasty was accompanied by \"the rectification of names\", a ceremony in which the sloppiness and erosion of meaning that had taken place under the previous dynasty were cleared up and language and its subjects correlated again. It was like a debt jubilee, only for meaning rather than money.</p> <p>This was part of what made <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/11/17/081117fa_fact_lizza\" title=\"\">Barack Obama's first presidential campaign</a> so electrifying: he seemed like a man who spoke our language and called many if not all things by their true names. Whatever caused that season of clarity, once elected, Obama promptly sank into the stale, muffled, parallel-universe language wielded by most politicians, and has remained there ever since. Meanwhile, the far right has got as far as it has by mislabelling just about everything in our world \u2013 a phenomenon which went supernova in this year of \"legitimate rape\", \"the apology tour\" and \"job creators\". Meanwhile, their fantasy version of economics keeps getting more fantastic. (Maybe there should be a rectification of numbers, too.)</p> <p>Let's rectify some names ourselves. We often speak as though the source of so many of our problems is complex and even mysterious. I'm not sure it is. You can blame it all on greed: the refusal to do anything about climate change, the attempts by the .01% to destroy our democracy, the constant robbing of the poor, the resultant starving children, the war against most of what is beautiful on this Earth.</p> <p>Calling lies \"lies\" and theft \"theft\" and violence \"violence\", loudly, clearly and consistently, until truth becomes more than a bump in the road, is a powerful aspect of political activism. Much of the work around human rights begins with accurately and aggressively reframing the status quo as an outrage, whether it's misogyny or racism or poisoning the environment. What protects an outrage are disguises, circumlocutions, and euphemisms \u2013 \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" for torture, \"collateral damage\" for killing civilians, \"the war on terror\" for the war against you and me and our Bill of Rights.</p> <p>Change the language and you've begun to change the reality or at least to open the status quo to question. Here is Confucius on the rectification of names:</p> <blockquote> \"If language is not correct, then what is said is not what is meant; if what is said is not what is meant, then what must be done remains undone; if this remains undone, morals and art will deteriorate; if justice goes astray, the people will stand about in helpless confusion. Hence there must be no arbitrariness in what is said. This matters above everything.\" </blockquote> <p>So let's start calling manifestations of greed by their true name. By greed, I mean the attempt of those who have plenty to get more, not the attempts of the rest of us to survive or lead a decent life. Look at the Waltons of Wal-Mart fame: the four main heirs are among the dozen richest people on the planet, each holding about $24bn (\u00a315bn). Their wealth is equivalent to that of the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/31/bernie-s/sanders-says-walmart-heirs-own-more-wealth-bottom-/\" title=\"\">bottom 40%</a> of Americans. The corporation Sam Walton founded now employs 2.2 million workers, two-thirds of them in the US, and the great majority are poorly paid people who feel intimidated and are often underemployed, and routinely depend on government benefits to survive. You could call that Walton Family welfare \u2013 a taxpayers' subsidy to their system. Strikes <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/10/10/walmart_workers_in_12_states_stage\" title=\"\">launched against Wal-Mart</a> this summer and autumn protested working conditions of astonishing barbarity \u2013 alleged abuses include warehouses that reach 48C (120F), a woman eight months pregnant <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/13/walmart-warehouse-workers-pilgrimage-photos_n_1881306.html?1347649325\" title=\"\">forced to work</a> at a brutal pace, commonplace exposure to pollutants, and the intimidation of those who attempted to organise or unionise.</p> <p>You would think that $24,000,000,000 apiece would be enough, but the Walton family sits atop a machine which appears intent upon brutalising tens of millions of people \u2013 the suppliers of Wal-Mart notorious for their abysmal working conditions, as well as the employees of the stores \u2013 only to add to piles of wealth already obscenely vast. Of course, what we call corporations are, in fact, perpetual motion machines, set up to endlessly extract wealth (and leave slagheaps of poverty behind) no matter what.</p> <p>They are generally organised in such a way that the brutality that leads to wealth extraction is committed by subcontractors at a distance or described in euphemisms, so that the stockholders, board members, and senior executives never really have to know what's being done in their names. And yet it is their job to know \u2013 just as it is each of our jobs to know what systems feed us and exploit or defend us, and the job of writers, historians, and journalists to rectify the names for all these things.</p> <p>The most terrifying passage in whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg's gripping book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0142003425/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20\" title=\"\">Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers</a> is not about his time in Vietnam, or his life as a fugitive after he released the Pentagon Papers. It's about a 1969 dinnertime conversation with a co-worker in a swanky house in Pacific Palisades, California. It took place right after Ellsberg and five of his colleagues had written a letter to the New York Times arguing for immediate withdrawal from the unwinnable, brutal war in Vietnam, and Ellsberg's host said, \"If I were willing to give up all this ... if I were willing to renege on ... my commitment to send my son to Groton ... I would have signed the letter.\"</p> <p>In other words, his unnamed co-worker had weighed trying to prevent the violent deaths of hundreds of thousands of people against the upper-middle-class perk of having his kid in a fancy prep school, and chosen the latter. The man who opted for Groton was, at least, someone who worked for what he had and who could imagine having painfully less. This is not true of the ultra-rich shaping the future of our planet.</p> <p>They could send tens of thousands to Groton, buy more Renoirs and ranches, and still not exploit the poor or destroy the environment, but they're as insatiable as they are ruthless. They are often celebrated in their aesthetic side-effects: imposing mansions, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer\" title=\"\">cultural patronage</a>, jewels, yachts. But in many, maybe most, cases they got rich through something a lot uglier, and that ugliness is still ongoing. Rectifying the names would mean revealing the ugliness of the sources of their fortunes and the grotesque scale on which they contrive to amass them, rather than the gaudiness of the trinkets they buy with them. It would mean seeing and naming the destruction that is the corollary of most of this wealth creation.</p> <p>Where this matters most is climate change. Why have we done almost nothing over the past 25 years about what was then a terrifying threat and is now a present catastrophe? Because it was bad for quarterly returns and fossil-fuel portfolios. When posterity indicts our era, this will be the feeble answer for why we did so little \u2013 that the rich and powerful with ties to the carbon-emitting industries have done everything in their power to prevent action on, or even recognition of, the problem. In this country in particular, they spent a fortune sowing doubt about the science of climate change and punishing politicians who brought the subject up. In this way have we gone through four \"debates\" and nearly a full election cycle with climate change unmentioned and unmentionable.</p> <p>These three decades of refusing to respond have wasted crucial time. It's as though you were prevented from putting out a fire until it was raging: now the tundra is thawing and Greenland's ice shield <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/greenland-melt.html\" title=\"\">is melting</a> and nearly every natural system is disrupted, from the acidifying oceans to the erratic seasons to droughts, floods, heat waves, and wildfires, and the failure of crops. We can still respond, but the climate is changed; the damage we all spoke of, only a few years ago, as being in the future is here, now.</p> <p>You can look at the chief executive officers of the oil corporations \u2013 Chevron's John Watson, for example, <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2012/04/13/chevron-boss-john-watson-made-25m-2011.html\" title=\"\">who received almost $25 million</a> ($1.57 million in salary and the rest in \"compensation\") in 2011 \u2013 or their major shareholders. They can want for nothing. They're so rich they could quit the game at any moment. When it comes to climate change, some of the wealthiest people in the world have weighed the fate of the Earth and every living thing on it for untold generations to come, the seasons and the harvests, this whole exquisite planet we evolved on, and they have come down on the side of more profit for themselves, the least needy people the world has ever seen.</p> <p>Take those billionaire energy tycoons Charles and David Koch, who are all over American politics these days. They are spending <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/03/koch-brothers-100-million-obama_n_1250828.html\" title=\"\">tens of millions of dollars</a> to defeat Obama, partly because he offends their conservative sensibilities, but also because he is less likely to be a completely devoted servant of their profit margins. He might, if we shout loud enough, rectify a few names. Under pressure, he might even listen to the public or environmental groups, while Romney poses no such problem (and under a Romney administration they will probably make more back in tax cuts than they are gambling on his election).</p> <p>Two years ago, the Koch brothers <a href=\"http://grist.org/article/koch-brothers-jump-into-prop-23-fight/\" title=\"\">spent $1m</a> on California's Proposition 23, an initiative written and put on the ballot by out-of-state oil companies to overturn our 2006 Global Warming Solutions Act. It lost by a landslide, but the Koch brothers have also invested a small fortune in spreading climate-change denial and sponsoring the Tea Party (which they can count on to oppose climate change regulation as big government or interference with free enterprise). This year they're backing a California initiative to silence unions. They want nothing to stand in the way of corporate power and the exploitation of fossil fuels. Think of it as another kind of war, and consider the early casualties.</p> <p>As the Irish Times <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2012/0620/1224318256659.html\" title=\"\">put it in an editorial</a> this summer:</p> <blockquote> \"Across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, hundreds of millions are struggling to adapt to their changing climate. In the last three years, we have seen 10 million people displaced by floods in Pakistan, 13 million face hunger in east Africa, and over 10 million in the Sahel region of Africa face starvation. Even those figures only scrape the surface. According to the Global Humanitarian Forum, headed up by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, climate change is responsible for 300,000 deaths a year and affects 300 million people annually. By 2030, the annual death toll related to climate change is expected to rise to 500,000 and the economic cost to rocket to $600 billion.\" </blockquote> <p>This coming year may see a dramatic increase in hunger due to rising food prices from crop failures, including this summer's in the US midwest after a scorching drought in which the Mississippi river <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/07/16/520241/low-water-levels-on-the-mississippi-river-a-major-threat-to-commerce-this-is-absolutely-not-normal/\" title=\"\">nearly ran dry</a> and crops withered.</p> <p>We need to talk about climate change as a war against nature, against the poor (especially the poor of Africa), and against the rest of us. There are casualties, there are deaths, and there is destruction, and it's all mounting. Rectify the name, call it war. While we're at it, take back the term \"pro-life\" to talk about those who are trying to save the lives of all the creatures suffering from the collapse of the complex systems on which plant and animal as well as human lives depend. The other side: \"pro-death\".</p> <p>The complex array of effects from climate change and their global distribution, as well as their scale and the science behind them makes it harder to talk about than almost anything else on Earth, but we should talk about it all the more because of that. And yes, the rest of us should do more, but what is the great obstacle those who have already tried to do so much invariably come up against? The oil corporations, the coal companies, the energy industry, its staggering <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/10/24/1064231/three-ways-big-oil-spends-its-profits-to-defend-oil-subsidies-and-defeat-clean-energy/\" title=\"\">financial clout</a>, its swarms of <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/08/01/579101/jurassic-park-romneys-bush-era-energy-team-is-dominated-by-fossil-fuel-insiders-and-its-lobbyists/\" title=\"\">lobbyists</a>, and the politicians in its clutches. Those who benefit most from the status quo, I learned in studying disasters, are always the least willing to change.</p> <p>I'm a Californian so I faced the current version of American greed early. Proposition 13, the initiative that froze property taxes and made it nearly impossible to raise taxes in our state, went into effect in 1978, two years before California's former governor Ronald Reagan won the presidency, in part by catering to greed. Prop 13, as it came to be known, went into effect when California was still an affluent state with the best educational system in the world, including some of the top universities around, nearly free to in-staters all the way through graduate school. Tax cuts have trashed the state and <a href=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175600/andy_kroll_back_to_$chool\" title=\"\">that education system</a>, and they are now doing the same to our country. The public sphere is to society what the biosphere is to life on earth: the space we live in together, and the attacks on them have parallels.</p> <p>What are taxes? They are that portion of your income that you contribute to the common good. Most of us are unhappy with how they're allocated \u2013 though few outside the left talk about the fact that more than half of federal <a href=\"http://nationalpriorities.org/en/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/\" title=\"\">discretionary expenditures</a> go to our <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/defense-spending-broken-down-with-infographic-2012-6\" title=\"\">gargantuan military</a>, more money than is spent on the <a href=\"http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/milex_15/the-15-countries-with-the-highest-military-expenditure-in-2011-table/view\" title=\"\">next 14 militaries combined</a>. Ever since Reagan, the right has complained unceasingly about fantasy expenditures \u2013 from that president's <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/23/politics/weflare-queen/index.html\" title=\"\">\"welfare queens\"</a> to Mitt Romney's attack on Big Bird and PBS (which consumes <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2012/10/04/romney-promises-to-cut-taxpayer-funding-for-pbs-but-says-he-still-loves-big-bird/\" title=\"\">.001%</a> of federal expenditures).</p> <p>As part of its religion of greed, the right invented a series of myths about where those taxes went, how paying them was the ultimate form of oppression, and what boons tax cuts were to bring us. They then delivered the biggest tax cuts of all to those who already had a superfluity of money and weren't going to pump the extra they got back into the economy. What they really were saying was that they wanted to hang onto every nickel, no matter how the public sphere was devastated, and that they really served the ultra-rich, over and over again, not the suckers who voted them into office.</p> <p>Despite decades of cutting to the bone, they continue to promote tax cuts as if they had yet to happen. Their constant refrain is that we are too poor to feed the poor or educate the young or heal the sick, but the poverty isn't monetary: it's moral and emotional. Let's rectify some more language: even at this moment, the United States remains the richest nation the world has ever seen, and California \u2013 with the richest agricultural regions on the planet and a colossal high-tech boom still ongoing in Silicon Valley \u2013 is loaded, too. Whatever its problems, the US is still swimming in abundance, even if that abundance is divided up ever more unequally.</p> <p>Really, there's more than enough to feed every child well, to treat every sick person, to educate everyone well without saddling them with hideous debt, to support the arts, to protect the environment \u2013 to produce, in short, a glorious society. The obstacle is greed. We could still make the sorts of changes climate change requires of us and become a very different nation without overwhelming pain. We would then lead somewhat different lives \u2013 richer, not poorer, for most of us (in meaning, community, power, and hope). Because this culture of greed impoverishes all of us, it is, to call it by its true name, destruction.</p> <p>One of the great accomplishments of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy-wall-street\" title=\"\">Occupy Wall Street</a> was this rectification of names. Those who came together under that rubric named the greed, inequality, and injustice in our system; they made the brutality of debt and the subjugation of the debtors visible; they called out Wall Street's crimes; they labelled the wealthiest among us the \"1%\", those who have made a profession out of pumping great sums of our wealth upwards (quite a different kind of tax). It was a label that made instant sense across much of the political spectrum. It was a good beginning. But there's so much more to do.</p> <p>Naming is only part of the work, but it's a crucial first step. A doctor initially diagnoses, then treats; an activist or citizen must begin by describing what is wrong before acting. To do that well is to call things by their true names. Merely calling out these names is a beam of light powerful enough to send the destroyers it shines upon scurrying for cover like roaches. After that, you still need to name your vision, your plan, your hope, your dream of something better.</p> <p>Names matter; language matters; truth matters. In this era when the mainstream media serve obfuscation and evasion more than anything else (except distraction), alternative media, social media, demonstrations in the streets, and conversations between friends are the refuges of truth, the places where we can begin to rectify the names. So start talking.</p>",
  "<p>I have been re-reading <a href=\"http://shakespeare.mit.edu/macbeth/full.html\" title=\"\">Macbeth</a> (my daughter is studying the play as a set text), marvelling at its economy, plotting and intensity. I won't be the first person to say that it feels like a play written in a few weeks.</p> <p>Shakespeare always seems to speak to one's latest preoccupations. For me, <a href=\"http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T23.html\" title=\"\">the Porter's speech, in act two, scene three</a> \u2013 where a minor character delivers a comic soliloquy with little direct relation to the unfolding tragedy \u2013 makes an apt commentary on the place of ephemera in our literature.</p> <p>Shakespeare's England is remote enough, but there are parallels with our own time. For one thing, just as we sometimes seem to be drowning in the printed word, so Elizabethan and Jacobean society witnessed an explosion of ephemeral publications: broadsheets, squibs, pamphlets, flyers and folios. Most of these are now forgotten as (presumably) most blogs, tweets and texts also will be.</p> <p>But every now and again \u2013 and the Porter's speech is an example \u2013 you can see Shakespeare exploiting mundane local references for dramatic effect. It's as if he has laid aside his Holinshed or Plutarch and picked up a contemporary tabloid.</p> <p>So, in Macbeth, a highly topical play, we find the Porter riffing on the keeping of Hell Gate and checking the souls of the damned. He opens by referring to \"a farmer, that hang'd himself on the expectation of plenty\" (clearly an allusion to market conditions) and then, more famously, to \"an equivocator\". This is almost certainly a reference to <a href=\"http://www.gunpowder-plot.org/garnet.asp\" title=\"\">the Jesuit traitor Father Henry Garnet</a>, who had been cruelly executed in the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot.</p> <p>Next, there's a jibe against \"English tailors\" cheating their customers. According to my Arden edition, this is a very old joke. Presumably, it would raise a laugh in the Pit, which is where the Porter was directing his speech; a moment of light relief after the horrors of the murder scene.</p> <p>Shakespeare seems to understand that he has pulled off a theatrical coup here. Famously, he concludes the speech with \"I pray you: remember the Porter\".</p> <p>As a scene, it punctuates the drama in the aftermath of Duncan's murder. As a text, it hints at the subcurrent of popular culture that flows beneath our greatest literature.</p> <p>The world wide web is still so new that poetry, fiction, and drama of all genres are adjusting to the dynamic interplay of high and low culture. That, for me, is one lesson suggested by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/fifty-shades-of-grey\" title=\"\">the Fifty Shades of Gray phenomenon</a>. Those books are still global bestsellers. Who will read, still less remember, them 10 years from now?</p>",
  "<p>On Friday night it started snowing. Very slowly at first, just a few flakes descending in the bitter Nottingham air. But then the sky began to fill with these little dots of ice and the revellers wandering along Beastmarket Hill pulled their hands into their shirt sleeves as they searched for taxis. Amid the modest flurry, I passed the main tent of the GameCity festival, occupying its usual place in the city's old square. Even at this hour, light was emanating from within, the promise of one more day of fun before the show ended on Saturday evening. But I was overcome with disappointment because I knew I wouldn't be going in again until next year. I buttoned up my coat and trudged off, dejected. </p> <p><a href=\"http://festival.gamecity.org/\">GameCity</a> is brilliant. Directed by Iain Simons and organised by a small but committed team (with the help of Nottingham Trent University and the city council), it seeks to provide an inclusive and exciting series of talks and events at venues all over the city. Throughout it all, indie developers, students and academics are able to exhibit their latest titles in the central tent, which is open and welcoming to all, from toddlers to pensioners. </p> <p>At this year's festival, you could see Phil Fish, the creator of Fez, giving a talk in which he imagined it was 2027. He provided a complex timeline leading to the release of Fez Forever, his first game's much delayed sequel \u2013 the timeline included a world war, a global electromagnetic blackout and the merger of Apple and Google into Agooglple. The talk was funny, self-depricating and at times biting (apparently the Xbox 360 version of Fez won't be patched successfully until 2024), and it was unlike any talk I'd seen in games before. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Ed Key gave a playthrough of his atmospheric retro-tinged exploration game <a href=\"http://www.visitproteus.com/\">Proteus</a>, accompanied by a live score \u2013 the audience was enraptured. We saw Irish coder <a href=\"http://distractionware.com/blog/\">Terry Cavanagh</a> challenging Edge journalist Jason Killingsworth to a blistering game of hardcore puzzler Super Hexagon. We saw the hugely likeable developer Mike Bithell asking a succession of industry legends how he could improve his own game, <a href=\"http://www.thomaswasalone.com/\">Thomas Was Alone</a>. Martin Hollis, co-creator of GoldenEye, told him it was fine as it is. Bithell looked as though he wanted time to stop and replay that moment forever.</p> <p>And on it went. We met <a href=\"http://minecraftedu.com/\">Minecraft Edu</a>, the small team of educators helping to promote the massively successful building game as a valuable classroom resource. We met the team from Media Molecule, the creators of LittleBigPlanet, who turned up to make paper models of their forthcoming title Tearaway. We got the radio show <a href=\"http://www.onelifeleft.com/\">One Life Left</a> doing their video game karaoke, encouraging audience members to sing new versions of pop hits modified to have gaming themes. Steve Owen of GamesPress managed to transform Ironic by Alannis Morrisette into a stinging indictment of unimaginative games writing (sample lyric: \"'It's like Heavy Rain on LCD, buy this game if it's your cup of tea'\").</p> <p>By way of contrast to that performance, Friday night saw an event named Reads Like a Seven, in which a bunch of journalists read out a series of their own articles \u2013 a sort of poetry slam, but with games. I had my reservations about the format, but it was an amazing night, with wonderful performances from Leigh Alexander, Ste Curran, Kieron Gillen, Simon Parkin and Cara Ellison. Oh, I also read out <a href=\"http://www.hookshotinc.com/confessions-of-a-middle-aged-games-writer/\">something</a> - it was\u2026 difficult.</p> <p>'Inspirational' is one word that kept cropping up during chats with other attendees. There is nothing about GameCity that smacks of the usual nonsense; no booth babes or bombastic trailers belting out on mega-watt sound systems, no superstar developers hyping franchise reboots or next generation graphics engines. Just lots of people who love games, or love discovering them, enjoying a sense of community, the brotherhood of a shared and meaningful passion. </p> <p>In the main tent, the heart of GameCity, the magic of gaming was apparent at every turn. The parents trying out touch-based shooters with their teenagers; the octogenarian couple helping each other to use an Xbox 360 controller; the kids interacting with Proteus by bouncing on a trampoline. I saw Lewie Proctor of <a href=\"http://savygamer.co.uk/\">Savygamer</a> playing the astonishing physical climbing game <a href=\"http://www.foddy.net/2011/03/girp/\">Girp</a>, with his dad; I'm glad I stumbled upon this heartwarming scene before the reading event on Friday night or I probably would have burst out crying.</p> <p>What GameCity7 said to me is that games are about so much more than this ridiculous month in which all the Triple AAA heavy-hitters flood onto the shop shelves at once. They spread out wider and further, they embrace companionship and community, laughter and sharing and creativity. They are life \u2013 just as much as music, books and movies are. These are the thoughts that kept me warm last Friday night as the snow fell on Nottingham town centre and the GameCity tent receded into the distance, into the past.</p>",
  "<h2>What is it? </h2> <p>The <em>Chalara fraxinea</em> fungus causes leaf loss and the dying back of the crown in ash trees, and often leads to the death of the tree. Older trees can survive initial infection but eventually tend to succumb. It has affected between 60% and 90% of ash trees in some areas of Denmark, where it was discovered in 2003, and is becoming widespread throughout central Europe. Ash trees were first reported to be hit in 1992 in Poland, but the disease was only began to understood in the mid 2000s and it was only diagnosed as a new organism in 2011.</p> <h2>When it was discovered in Britain? </h2> <p>The first case was confirmed on an ash tree imported from the Netherlands to a nursery in Buckinghamshire in February 2012. Since then infected nursery plants or recently planted samplings have also been found in Yorkshire, Surrey, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Leicester, Durham and Glasgow.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y1GpufLkBto?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y1GpufLkBto\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>What about more mature woodlands?</h2> <p>There have been 10 confirmed cases in established woodlands and hedgerows in East Anglia in the last two weeks. There are a further 12 suspected cases awaiting lab results in East Anglia and Kent.</p> <h2>What are the symptoms? </h2> <p>Dark patches on green leaves spread to twigs and branches creating brown patches and splits on twigs and branches. Wilting leaves above the cankerous area.</p> <h2>How serious is the threat?</h2> <p>Potentially very serious. The fungus has been compared to Dutch elm disease that devastated Britain's population of elm trees in the 1970s. Ash trees are the dominant species in around 5% of Britain's woods, at 129,000 hectares.</p> <h2>What are the knock-on effects?</h2> <p>A significant loss of ash trees could hit 60 of Britain's rarest insects which live in ash trees. Lichens and mosses, which grow on its bark, would also be hit. Ash trees and hedges an integral part of the British landscape - the National Trust warned that the spread of the disease would be \"horrific\".</p> <h2>How has it spread to Britain?</h2> <p>The first cases in Britain were found in infected samplings imported from Europe. But the cases in established woods were all in the south-east of Britain, suggesting it may also be spreading on the wind.</p> <h2>What is being done to tackle the disease?</h2> <p>Around 100 staff from the Forestry Commission and Food and Environment Research Agency have been redeployed to focus on the crisis. More than 100,000 trees and saplings have been burned. A task force headed by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs's (Defra) chief scientific adviser, Prof Ian Boyd, has been set up. The import and movement ash trees has been banned from Monday. Ash can still be imported as timber and firewood, though the Forestry Commission said such wood \"pose[s] a very low risk of disease transmission.\"</p> <h2>What happens next?</h2> <p>The government will need to decide whether it tries to contain the disease or attempt to eradicate it altogether - an option that is likely to cost tens of millions of pounds.</p> <h2>Was the government slow to react?</h2> <p>Yes, according to the opposition. The shadow environment secretary, Mary Creagh , said: \"It is a very severe pathogen. The economic, environmental and biodiversity risk it brings with it our huge. Defra's handling of the spread of this disease has been woefully inadequate.\" Last year trade unions in the Forestry Commission warned that its ability to tackle tree diseases would be hit by 25% cuts to the agency.</p>",
  "<p>The liveblog was a revelation for us at the Guardian. The sports desk had been doing them for years, experimenting with different styles, methods and tone. And then about three years ago the news desk started using them to great effect.</p> <p>I think it was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/mattwells\" title=\"\">Matt Wells</a>, our US blogs and networks editor, who suggested that perhaps the liveblog was <em>the</em> network-native format for news. I think that's nearly right, though it's less the format of a liveblog than the activity powering the page that demonstrates where news editing is going.</p> <p>It's about orchestrating the streams of data flowing across the internet into a compelling use in one form or another. One way to render that data is the liveblog. Other ways include a map with placemarks, an RSS feed, a stream of tweets and Storify.</p> <p>I'm not talking about big data for news. There is certainly a substantial challenge in big data investigations and intelligent data visualizations around giving meaning to complex statistics and databases. But this is different.</p> <p>I'm talking about telling stories by playing DJ to the beat of human observation.</p> <p>We're working on one such experiment with a location-tagging tool we call <a href=\"http://feedwax.com/\" title=\"\">FeedWax</a>. It creates location-aware streams of data by looking across various media sources including Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Google News, Daylife, etc.</p> <p>The idea with FeedWax is to unify various types of data through shared contexts, beginning with location. These sources may only have a keyword to join them up or perhaps nothing at all, but when you add location they may turn out to share important meaning and relevance. The context of space and time is natural connective tissue, particularly when the words people use to describe something may vary.</p> <p>We've been conducting experiments in orchestrated stream-based and map-based storytelling on n0tice for a while now. When you start crafting the inputs with tools such as FeedWax, you have what feels like a more frictionless mechanism for shaping the flood of data from Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, etc into something interesting.</p> <p>For example, when the space shuttle Endeavour flew its last flight and subsequently labored through the streets of LA there was no shortage of coverage from on-the-ground citizen reporters. I'd bet not one of them considered themselves a citizen reporter. They were just trying to get a photo of this awesome sight and share it, perhaps getting some acknowledgement in the process.</p> <p>You can see the stream of images and tweets <a href=\"http://n0tice.com/search?q=endeavor+OR+endeavour\" title=\"\">here</a>, or plotted on a map <a href=\"http://goo.gl/maps/osh8T\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p> <p>Interestingly, the location of the photos gives you a very clear picture of the flight path. This is crowdmapping without requiring that anyone do anything they wouldn't already do.

  "<p>Penguin's chief executive has ruled out accepting a counterbid from Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which owns rival publisher HarperCollins, saying that its venture with Bertelsmann's Random House is a done deal.</p> <p>Murdoch is understood to have made a \"very general approach\" to Pearson when the deal with Bertelsmann was already close to being signed.</p> <p>However, Pearson is understood to have believed an offer from News Corporation to buy Penguin outright would not have been financially viable.</p> <p>John Makinson, who will take the role of executive chairman of the board of the new Penguin Random House, dismissed the chances of News Corp derailing the deal by making a cash offer for Penguin.</p> <p>\"There isn't any sort of break clause [with Bertelsmann],\" he said. \"It is a signed transaction.\" The Penguin chief said that the board of Pearson had \"exhaustively examined\" all options for the business before settling on the Bertelsmann deal.</p> <p>He did not directly deny the question of whether this process included having previously held talks with News Corp or HarperCollins. \"I'm not talking too much about that,\" he said. \"I don't think we should talk about that, that should be something you ask Pearson.\"</p> <p>About two-thirds of Penguin's business is in the US, meaning any deal with News Corp would have triggered huge capital gains tax liabilities.</p> <p>This means that Murdoch, or any bidder looking to buy Penguin outright, would have had to have paid an extremely price to make it worthwhile for Pearson \u2013 significantly over \u00a31bn.</p> <p>It is not now possible for Murdoch to derail the Bertelsmann deal with a blockbuster offer to shareholders, as the joint venture plan does not require approval by Pearson investors.</p> <p>The deal does not qualify as a class one transaction according to UK listing authority rules on tests relating to market capitalisation and profits.</p> <p>Makinson dismissed concerns that creating a global book powerhouse \u2013 Penguin Random House will have combined revenues of \u00a32.4bn \u2013 will threaten the independent publishers and vibrancy in the book market.</p> <p>\"There will be a high degree of separation and autonomy and continuity in the [existing] editorial structures of the two companies,\" he said. \"From the perspective of a reader, author or agent there won't be very much change in the day-to-day operations of the companies.\"</p> <p>He also said the strategy behind the deal was not to take an axe to the editorial side of the business, but that there could be savings to be had in the back office.</p> <p>\"This is not consolidation being driven by financial cost arithmetic,\" he said. \"In the back end sure, a lot of savings can be achieved in procurement and technology investment.\"</p> <p>He said that the deal was driven by a need to successfully transform the Penguin and Random House businesses to a world of ebooks, and maintain strength in the face of ever-strengthening online players such as Amazon.</p> <p>\"We are all worried as the world moves to a more digital structure for content and distribution, that publishing could diminish, fewer books be published and fewer risks taken,\" he said. \"We hope to be able to offer more to readers and authors. This [deal] will give us resources, capacity and confidence to publish a broad array [of content] and to take risks, that is what good publishing is about.\"</p> <p>Makinson said he expected to spend more time in New York, where he says he believes the headquarters of the new venture will be based, as well as London.</p> <p>Random House's Markus Dohle has been appointed a chairman and chief executive of the new venture, with Bertelsmann holding five board seats, Pearson four.</p> <p>Makinson said that the decision to strike a deal with Bertelsmann \u2013 talks started five months ago \u2013 was undertaken with the unanimous backing of the Pearson board.</p> <p>\"It has been a very thorough process,\" he said. \"The board of Pearson examined [every option] exhaustively. There was a great deal of analysis of all options available to Penguin. We looked at selling, merging, buying, running it differently within Pearson. We concluded this was the best option for Pearson's shareholders and the publishing industry.\"</p> <p>Makinson dismissed the view of some analysts that Penguin Random House is likely to run into regulatory issues. \"I don't think our combined market share will trigger the need for disposals \u2013 30% is an important number,\" he said, referring to the acceptable market share bar set by Universal Music's takeover of EMI.</p> <p>\"We don't expect to be north of 30%,\" he added. \"In the round we expect to meet the regulatory criteria.\" He said that in a few \"small discrete markets\" there may be a need to \"have a discussion\". However, his legal advice indicates no need for significant disposals in major markets, he added.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>The BBC is expected to conclude a deal this week that will avert the threat of Test Match Special being silenced, or at least grounded, for England's forthcoming series in India.</p> <p>The Corporation has been standing alongside Sky in a dispute with the Indian cricket authorities who are demanding extra money to cover the costs of broadcasting facilities on top of the rights agreements that have already been negotiated with Star TV.</p> <p>But unlike Sky, which has already made arrangements for its commentary team to cover the four Tests from their London studio, the BBC has been backed into a corner. It has stressed the importance of its commentators being able to convey the atmosphere from the ground, to emphasise the difference between its TMS offering and the coverage provided by sites such as TestMatchSofa.com, where the commentary is provided from television pictures along the same lines of Sky's Soccer Saturday programme.</p> <p>That would seem to leave it in a weak bargaining position with the Board for Control of Cricket in India, and must raise questions about the value of an agreement for radio rights which does not guarantee commentators entry to the grounds.</p> <p>The BCCI is reported to be demanding around \u00a350,000 from the BBC to cover radio production costs at the four Tests in Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Nagpur and Kolkata \u2013 whereas Sky has been asked for 10 times that figure to install a studio with the necessary facilities for presenting matches from each of the grounds.</p> <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board has been involved in the background but are anxious to maintain a low-key stance, partly because in this instance the BCCI seems to be receiving unfair criticism.</p> <p>It is not signed any rights deals or contracts with Sky or the BBC, having sold global media rights to Indian cricket to Star TV, and are now acting as a production house. In the past, the TV channel that has owned the rights has also tended to control production, so such disputes have rarely arisen.</p> <p>The BBC has not commented on the details of its agreement with Star, and will only say that negotiations with the BCCI are continuing. That is also the official position with Sky, although with little more than a fortnight until the start of the series it seems increasingly likely that its commentators will be staying at home \u2013 which could cause an additional problem for The Times newspaper, whose cricket correspondent Mike Atherton is also a member of the Sky team.</p>",
  "<p>So, are the <a href=\"http://www.nodashforgas.org.uk/\">\"No dash for gas\"</a> protesters perched atop the cooling towers of the new West Burton gas-fired power station in Nottinghamshire right? They argue:</p> <blockquote> <p>The new 'dash for gas' will leave us dependent on a highly polluting and increasingly expensive fossil fuel for decades to come. It would make even our modest carbon reduction targets impossible to hit, and cause household energy bills to soar even further.</p> </blockquote> <p>The answer is mostly yes, for reasons I'll explain below. So why is the new dash for gas now sprinting out of the starting blocks? For two reasons, one justified and one not. The first is that some new gas will be needed in the UK, as ageing and dirty nuclear and coal power plants are phased out. The second is that the chancellor George Osborne has been captured by a small but influential group of fracking fanatics who have convinced him that shale gas will bring a game-changing bonanza of cheap gas. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/28/shale-gas-fracking-uk-carbon-energy\">It won't</a>.</p> <p>But let's start with the basics and the most independent source we have, the government's official advisers, the <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\">Committee on Climate Change</a>. They are charged with setting out the lowest cost, lowest risk path to meeting the nation's legally binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Their \"Plan A\" allows for 10GW of new gas-fired electricity generation, about 10 new power stations. For the energy policy geeks out there, that leads to a carbon intensity of about 50g of CO2 being emitted per kWh of electricity in 2030.</p> <p>But, if the renewable energy or nuclear power envisaged in Plan A does not materialise in a big way, then says the UK will need a Plan B: 20GW of new gas power and about 100g of CO2 per kWh in 2030. That doesn't mean the nation will have given up on its carbon targets, says the CCC, but the balance of cost and risk is better for Plan A.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/28/gas-fired-power-stations-uk\">20GW goal is what ministers are now pursuing</a>, so according the CCC they have chosen a more risky and more expensive path. </p> <p>How so? First, no-one outside the shale gas lobby thinks fracking will deliver cheap, plentiful gas for the UK and so make a big dash for gas sensible. \"Look at European gas price projections ... they all agree on the direction \u2013 up. European shale will help, but not on a US scale.\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/28/shale-gas-fracking-uk-carbon-energy\">says the CBI's boss John Cridland</a>. He later added: \"An over reliance on new gas would leave us exposed to global price and supply fluctuations and jeopardise our carbon targets.\" </p> <p>It's worth contrasting that with Osborne's comment, when he shoehorned himself into the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/17/dash-for-gas-proposals-campaigners\">dash for gas announcement</a> made by energy secretary Ed Davey in March. \"Gas is a reliable, affordable source of energy,\" said the chancellor. Very few agree with him, not least people facing soaring gas and electricity bills, mainly due to rising gas prices over the last few years.</p> <p>Another risk comes from the duty to meet carbon targets. The 20 big new power stations will apparently have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/17/dash-for-gas-proposals-campaigners\">licences to operate to 2045</a> without cutting their carbon emissions. I can't see how that tallies with cutting emissions by the amount needed, but let's say it somehow can be made to do so. That means we'll need carbon capture and storage technology operating at full scale, yet that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/may/09/carbon-capture-storage-climate-change\">seems as far off as ever</a> thereby creating another risk.</p> <p>A final risk was set out recently by a <a href=\"http://www.e3g.org/about/news-articles/press-release-dash-for-gas-risks-high-costs-for-industry-and-consumers/\">report commissioned by consultants E3G</a>, which found that a gas-heavy electricity system in the UK created a much greater risk of soaring energy prices than a renewables-based system.</p> <p>So, what one might call a \"stroll for gas\" is needed - roughly 10 new plants - and even a dash for gas does not necessarily blow the UK's carbon budgets, according to the CCC. But the dash increases the risk of both higher price rises than already predicted and the risk of busting those budgets. Unless you don't believe climate change is a threat, or you do believe in the UK shale gas fantasy, the dash for gas looks dumb.</p> <p>Osborne appears to be winning the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/17/energy-policy-coalition-green-agenda\">energy policy battle</a>, which is expected to come to a head next week with the publication of the energy bill. He \"has different facts\", according to a senior source, taking advice from only a very small circle. If he really cares about the economy, he should get out more.</p>",

Penguin's owner Pearson will retain 47%, with John Makinson, currently chairman and chief executive of Penguin, stepping up as chairman of the joint venture, which will be called Penguin Random House.</p> <p>Pearson also revealed in an interim management statement on Monday that Penguin revenues shrank 2% in the first nine months of 2012, despite a 35% year-on-year boost in ebook sales in the third quarter.</p> <p>The company's education operation, which accounts for about 75% of Pearson's business, also reported declining revenues. Pearson's share price was down slightly, by 0.8% or 10p, to \u00a312.21 at 11am on Monday.</p> <p>Key titles for Penguin include Jamie Oliver's 15 Minute Meals and Ken Follett's Winter of the World.</p> <p>The revenue decline is an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/27/penguin-profits-slump-ebook-revenue-up-33percent?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">improvement on Penguin's performance in the first half of the year</a>, when sales slumped by 4% year on year, due in part to the success of EL James's Fifty Shades of Grey, which is published by Random House-owned Vintage Books.</p> <p>Pearson confirmed its full year financial guidance to investors of adjusted earnings per share to be about 84.9p, however, Monday's update revealed that performance across its businesses was mixed.</p> <p>Overall, Pearson reported flat underlying revenues in the first nine months, as operating profit fell 5% year on year</p> <p>The company said operating profits were down due to the loss of income from FTSE International. Pearson sold its 50% stake in the index last year.</p> <p>\"We have confidently reiterated our guidance because many of our businesses are going strong in this complicated trading environment,\" said Dame Majorie Scardino, outgoing chief executive of Pearson. \"But the dynamics of the markets we're in could make that achievement more about resilience than flamboyance.\"</p> <p>The Pearson-owned Financial Times grew underlying revenues by 7% in the first nine months of the year.</p> <p>FT Group, which publishes the FT and houses the company's 50% stake in the Economist, said that digital subscriptions to the FT grew 17% year on year in the first nine months to 313,000.</p> <p>The FT Group as a whole grew underlying revenues by 7% year on year for the period, although Pearson noted that advertising \"remains weak and short-term\".</p> <p>Pearson's flagship education businesses, which account for 75% of group revenues, slowed.</p> <p>North American education revenue fell 3% year on year on an underlying basis, professional education dived 12% and international education grew 6%.</p> <p>All three education divisions slowed compared to the revenue performance reported in the first six months of the year.</p> <p>\"The fourth quarter is always a key selling season in education and consumer publishing,\" said Pearson. \"We expect market conditions to remain tough, but we believe we can sustain our solid third-quarter trading momentum.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>The Junior Isa is a year old on Thursday \u2013 but the celebrations look like being low-key. They were launched on 1 November last year as a tax-free way of saving or investing for a child, but 12 months on all the evidence is that awareness of the new accounts and take-up are both low.</p> <p>More than half (56%) of parents with children under 18 haven't even heard of them, according to recent research from kids' savings specialist Family Investments. And official government data shows only 71,000 accounts were taken out in the first five months.</p> <p>But at the same time, mums, dads and grandparents clearly want to save, and are aware that with the cost of university rocketing and the huge sums required to get on the property ladder, it's more vital than ever to start planning.</p> <p>The survey found that 92% of parents thought it important to put some money aside for their offspring.</p> <p>While the tax benefits of Junior Isas are arguably pretty minimal for most, they do make investing for a child much simpler. Anyone can contribute \u2013 allowing parents, grandparents, relatives and friends to pay into a single plan.</p> <p>However, because they have no control over the way in which the child can use their Isa money when they reach 18, some will want to go for a different type of account or investment. There is, of course, nothing stopping you from opening a traditional children's savings account.</p> <p>First, some basic facts: They are long-term, tax-free and any UK child under 18 can have one as long as they don't have a child trust fund. Broadly, this means those born before 1 September 2002 or after 2 January 2011 are eligible. Both cash and stocks and shares Junior Isas are available, and your child can have one or both. They are offered by banks, building societies, fund management companies, stockbrokers and so on, and parents, family and friends can contribute up to \u00a33,600 per tax year. The account is owned by the child, and the money locked in until he or she turns 18, though they can manage their account from age 16.</p> <p>One of the first decisions people must make is whether to go for a cash account, or one where much, or all, of the money is invested in shares. If you are jumpy about \"gambling\" your child's cash on the stock market, about 30 banks and building societies offer cash Junior Isas.</p> <p>Most people aren't aware of this, but the <strong>Halifax </strong>offers an impressive 6% interest on its Junior Cash Isa, provided mum or dad (or whoever the \"adult registered contact\" is) holds a Halifax cash Isa with at least \u00a31 in it. Others paying a decent(ish) rate include:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Nationwide's</strong> Smart Junior Isa \u2013 3.25% variable until 31 January 2014. After this, the rate reverts to 2.1%. Nationwide is thought to be the biggest provider of cash Junior Isas, with 66,000 opened since last November.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Coventry </strong>building society's Junior Cash Isa - 3.25%.</p> <p>\u2022 The <strong>Furness and Mansfield</strong> building societies have cash Junior Isas paying 3.05% with <strong>Market Harborough</strong> building society paying the same on balances of \u00a33,000-plus.</p> <p>Of course, many experts argue that the stock market is where you need to be when it comes to investing over a long period (up to 18 years), because it's argued that shares almost always produce a better return than savings accounts. James Bateman, head of manager selection at Fidelity, says: \"Because it is so long-term, many investors should consider higher-risk funds \u2013 and, in particular, generally equities over fixed income since historically, over long periods, the former have substantially outperformed the latter.\"</p> <p>Several investment firms offer Junior Isa products specifically aimed at parents, such as <strong>Witan's </strong><a href=\"http://www.jumpsavings.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Jump</strong></a> scheme, but you don't need to be restricted to those. If you are happy to make your own decisions, you can access hundreds, or even thousands, of funds via a \"fund platform\" such as Hargreaves Lansdown's Vantage service, Fidelity FundsNetwork or JP Morgan WealthManager+. The Guardian has a service called <a href=\"http://www.guardianinvesting.co.uk/\">Guardian Investing</a>, provided by Skipton Financial Services.</p> <p>Danny Cox at Hargreaves Lansdown reckons that those investing for more than five years, and who are happy with some risk \"can't go far wrong with an equity income fund\" such as Invesco Perpetual High Income. If you were going to \"spice it up\" and were looking at a longer term \u2013 perhaps more like 10 years \u2013 he suggests an emerging markets fund such as First State Global Emerging Markets Leaders.</p> <p>The top 10 most popular Hargreaves Lansdown Junior Isa fund choices are:</p> <p>\u2022 Invesco Perpetual High Income<br>\u2022 First State Global Emerging Markets Leaders<br>\u2022 Invesco Perpetual Income<br>\u2022 Newton Asian Income<br>\u2022 Lindsell Train Global Equity<br>\u2022 Aberdeen Emerging Markets<br>\u2022 HL Multi-Manager Income &amp; Growth Trust<br>\u2022 Aberdeen Asia Pacific<br>\u2022 Marlborough Special Situations<br>\u2022 Newton Emerging Income</p> <p>When buying a stocks and shares Junior Isa, watch out for high management charges. There are funds out there with low charges, such as Fidelity MoneyBuilder UK Index, a tracker fund, where the annual management fee is just 0.1%</p> <p>You can also do it yourself by using a discount broker such as <a href=\"http://www.cavendishonline.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cavendish Online</a>, which no longer charges an admin fee but, instead, takes a very small part of the AMC \u2013 in most cases 0.05% of the fund value.</p>",

The figures follow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/18/back-school-britain-retail-sales?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"Back to school Britain boosts retail sales\">positive retail sales data for the month</a>, which showed a 0.6% increase in volumes, and news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/uk-emerges-from-double-dip-recession-george-osborne?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"UK emerges from double-dip recession\">the UK came out of recession in the third quarter of 2012</a>.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, warned against reading too much into one month's data, but said this could be an early sign that consumers were becoming more confident about spending.</p> <p>\"The marked rise in consumer credit in September is potentially notable as consumers' appetite for taking on new borrowing has been limited for some considerable time, while there has also been an ongoing strong desire of many consumers to reduce their debt,\" he said.</p> <p>\"If consumers are becoming more prepared to spend \u2013 helped by recent healthy employment growth, lower overall inflation and an edging up in earnings growth from the lows seen earlier in 2012 \u2013 then there is a real chance the economy can continue to grow following the third-quarter rebound in GDP.\"</p> <p>The Bank's figures showed lending secured on dwellings rose by \u00a30.5bn, in line with the previous six-month average.</p> <p>There was an increase in the number of mortgages approved in September to 94,385 from 90,023 in August. The number of loan approvals for house purchase reached 50,024, higher than the previous six-month average of 48,832.</p> <p>The number of approvals for remortgaging also increased, totalling 28,343 compared to the previous six-month average of 27,664. A price war on mortgages for borrowers with 40% to put down as a deposit, combined with an increase in the standard variable rate at Santander, may have prompted borrowers to move their loan to a new rate.</p> <p>Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said the Funding for Lending scheme launched at the start of August may also have boosted numbers.</p> <p>\"The uptick in lending seen in September is caused by a number of factors: increased loan availability, better rates as a result of the Funding for Lending scheme, and increased confidence among buyers. Some more realistic pricing from vendors keen to shift stock that has been hanging around for a while is also helping,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The end of the double-dip recession illustrates that the economy is very much on the right track, which is crucial for consumer confidence, and should have a further positive impact on the housing and mortgage markets.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last year, when I co-wrote <a href=\"http://roughguide.to/communityenergy/\">a little book on community energy</a>, it still felt like a niche topic. There was exciting stuff going on around the country but unless you happened to be involved in local green group or living somewhere such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/06/free-book-guide-community-energy\">Settle</a> then you probably wouldn't have heard about it. Even if you had, there wouldn't necessarily have be an easy way for you to invest. In the past couple of months, though, a host of new websites and projects have appeared, suggesting that community energy is quickly going mainstream.</p> <p>First out of the stalls, in August, was <a href=\"https://www.abundancegeneration.com/\">Abundance</a> \u2013 a new site enabling individuals to invest savings in community energy projects around the UK. It is still early days for the company, with just a handful of projects listed, but the proposition is attractive, with investments in windfarms giving a payback equivalent to an annual return of 5\u20139%. August also saw a <a href=\"http://www.triodos.co.uk/en/personal/investments/renewables/overview/\">new public share issue for energy investments from Triodos Bank</a>, which has achieve an 8.5% return in the last year. Hot on their heals was <a href=\"http://www.microgenius.org.uk/\">MicroGenius</a>, another matchmaker enabling small-scale investors to buy shares in local energy projects around the country.</p> <p>Then, earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.solarschools.org.uk/\">Solar Schools</a> began its national rollout. Run by <a href=\"http://1010uk.org/\">10:10</a>, the scheme offers a website and toolkit to enable schools to fund a solar roof by raising micro-donations from the local community. The main aim in this case isn't maximising the number of kilowatts installed but finding a way to give huge numbers of parents, friends, family members and neighbours a positive first experience with low-carbon energy, at the same time as kick-starting a broader environment effort in the schools and their communities \u2013 something that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/apr/30/schools-solar-power-climate-change-community\">worked brilliantly in the pilot scheme</a>. (Full disclosure: <a href=\"http://minormass.com/2011/09/solar-schools/\">I developed this project in its early days</a>.)</p> <p>But community-owned energy isn't only about the small-scale. Also bubbling up are projects such as <a href=\"http://www.trillionfund.com/\">Trillion Fund</a>, which expects to launch soon and plans to create \"new source of funding for renewable energy projects worldwide\". Its name hints at its level of ambition. Then there's Oxford-based <a href=\"http://www.energybank.eu/\">EnergyBank</a>, brainchild of Tim Helweg-Larsen, who has been working away behind the scenes for a couple of years on a project that could eventually drive huge sources of cash into offshore wind \u2013 the vast but largely untapped energy resource that Helweg-Larsen mapped out in the <a href=\"http://www.offshorevaluation.org/\">Offshore Valuation Report</a>. His vision is a world in which large-scale energy installations such as offshore windfarms are \"owned by the people and businesses that use them\".</p> <p>None of this, in itself, is going to solve climate change. But community energy definitely has a role to play. For example, in the case of onshore wind, it can help build local support for planning applications \u2013 which will be crucial if the technology is ever going to gain a real foothold in the UK. A new poll underlined that point this week. As Damian Carrington wrote on Tuesday:</p> <blockquote> <p>The poll showed 49% of people would support a wind turbine being erected within two miles of their home, with 22% against. But if the project were community-owned, support rose to 68% and opposition plummeted to 7%. In Germany, where 65% of its huge renewable energy capacity is community-owned, opposition is much rarer than in UK where community ownership is less than 10%.</p> </blockquote> <p>Solar projects tend to be smaller scale and the technology is more expensive per unit of energy generated. But there's plenty of anecdotal and academic evidence to suggest that adding solar to buildings \u2013 whether homes or community buildings \u2013 can have remarkable effects in terms of <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421507000651\">reducing energy demand</a> and increasing engagement with energy and climate issues more broadly.</p> <p>The government, in principle, supports all this. The energy and climate secretary, Ed Davey, says community projects are \"vital to our vision of the development of energy in the UK\" and his department plans to publish a community energy strategy next year. In the meantime, though, the <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/energybill2012/energybill2012.aspx\">Electricity Market Reform</a> (EMR) is working its way through parliament and some people in the community energy field are concerned that the changes will hobble the thriving community energy scene.</p> <p>Under the EMR, small-scale green energy projects \u2013 those below 5MW \u2013 qualify for subsidies via the feed-in tariff (Fit), which offers a fixed payment for each unit of low-carbon energy created. But larger projects are funded through a complicated new arrangement called <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/energybill2012/energybill2012.aspx\">Contracts For Difference</a> (CFD). This system was designed with giant energy projects and big corporates in mind and, as a result, it's hugely offputting for smaller community organisations. Rebecca Willis, an energy consultant working with Co-operatives UK, says the CFDs are \"fiendishly complicated and uncertain\". She points out that \"with a Fit you know what you're going to get. With a CFD it depends on the strike price and the average price on the market.\" This makes it much less attractive to small-scale investors.</p> <p>Even if some community groups are able to navigate the CFD process, they will also face a lower return than the larger energy companies would get for the same project. That's because smaller players usually need to distribute their energy via a power purchasing agreement with one of the \"big six\" energy companies rather than selling it directly into the wholesale market. As a result, Willis says, \"the same wind turbine will get 20\u201330% less if it's owned by a community than if it's owned by E.ON.\"</p> <p>For these two reasons, community energy projects will be faced with what Willis describes as \"a perverse incentive to do stuff under 5MW\". That not only seems unfair and unambitious. It also means a whole tier of potential energy projects may not get off the ground because while community projects are effectively being capped at 5MW, big commercial investors \"won't get out of bed for less than 25MW\", Willis says.</p> <p>If the government is serious about community energy's potential, it should tweak the EMR rules to accommodate larger-scale community projects as well as finding ways to encourage and support smaller-scale ones. None of this is incompatible with enabling giant-scale energy projects too \u2013 including nuclear and CCS as well as renewables. It just means giving community energy a fair chance to break out beyond the microscale.</p>",

  "<p>Reducing public expenditure to deal with the financial deficit means innovation - and innovative budgeting - is now more necessary than ever before for public services.</p> <p>Prioritising services means making difficult decisions, noted the CBI and the Institute of Public Policy Research, in the summer. \"These are not unmanageable pressures, still less justification for abandoning a commitment to excellent public services.

  "<p>Forests are feeling the squeeze. Overall forest loss ran at 5.2m hectares per year between 2000-2010, driven principally by increasing consumer demand for food, fuel and fibre from a global population soaring upwards of 7 billion.</p> <p>People are the ultimate losers; half a billion indigenous people and 1.3 billion others whose livelihoods are attuned to and dependent on forests, are losing more, and more quickly than others. But of course all of us indirectly and ultimately depend on forests; to sequester carbon and slow climate change, to maintain water and soil cycles on which food, fuel and fibre production depends, and to preserve biodiversity to allow options for adaptation in an uncertain future.</p> <p>Some immediately, and all of us ultimately, may pay a heavy price unless we can create an investment opportunity that delivers food, fuel and fibre without sacrificing them. Justice demands that this opportunity should also prosper indigenous and other forest dependant peoples. This requires a better investment model.</p> <p>Investing in Locally Controlled Forestry (ILCF) has emerged over the last three years <a href=\"http://environment.yale.edu/tfd/uploads/TFDReview_ILCF_FINAL_LO-RES.pdf\" title=\"\">as a strong candidate for this better investment model</a>. Dialogues in nine countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America were convened by The Forest Dialogue (TFD) and funded by the Growing Forest Partnership (GFP) initiative and the government of Sweden (where <a href=\"http://environment.yale.edu/tfd/uploads/TFD_ILCF_Sweden_Background.pdf\" title=\"\">100 years of ILCF has already taken place</a>. More than 400 people pooled their expertise.</p> <p>Those looking at what was working, and what was not, included not only investors and forest experts, but also representatives of forest rights-holder organisations such as the Global Alliance for Community Forestry, the International Alliance of Indigenous and Tribal People's of the Tropical Forests and the International Family Forest Alliance \u2013 k<a href=\"http://www.g3forest.org/index.cfm\" title=\"\">nown collectively as the G3</a>.</p> <p>The G3 define locally controlled forestry (LCF) as: \"The local right for forest owner families and communities to make decisions on commercial forest management and land use, with secure tenure rights, freedom of association and access to markets and technology.\"</p> <p>Locally controlled forestry is big news. Forests under some form of local control make up 25% of the world's forests and provide US$75-US$100bn (\u00a347bn-\u00a362bn) a year in goods and services and there are grounds for hoping this will grow. Strong evidence over the last 60 years documents <a href=\"http://www.growingforestpartnerships.org/sites/growingforestpartnerships.org/files/gfp_GFP_locallycontrolledforestry.pdf\" title=\"\">how LCF often outperforms alternatives such as concessions in economic terms</a> and protected areas in environmental terms.</p> <p>Investing in locally controlled forestry (ILCF) is a paradigm shift \u2013 away from capital seeking forest resources and needing labour \u2013 towards local rights-holders managing forest resources and seeking capital. It recognises the need to distinguish and blend two types of investment:</p> <p>\u2022 Asset investment (conventional investment in which the nominal value of underlying capital is expected to increase or at least not fall) and;</p> <p>\u2022 Enabling investment (in which capital is foregone to build the self-sufficiency and attractiveness of the business in question).</p> <p><strong>Clever ways to encourage investors</strong></p> <p>Asset investors shy from investing in local controlled forestry for four main reasons: insecure local commercial forest rights (on which to base a deal); lack of business capacity (to seal the deal); lack of commercial organisation (to make scale worth the costs of due diligence); and a lack of brokers (to match those between whom a deal might be struck).</p> <p>A clever mix of four types of enabling investment is needed to pave the way for asset investment and packaging up enabling and asset investment cleverly can boost asset investor's confidence.</p> <p>A field visit to the shea butter forests of Burkina Faso is one of many examples, including another in Ethiopia, where four types of enabling investment were used. The Union of Women Producers of Shea Products of Sissili and Ziro was established in 2001 (it became the Nununa Federation in 2011) and processes nuts into shea butter for a range of products like soaps and creams.</p> <p>Enabling investment to negotiate more secure commercial forest rights for shea currently comes from NGO supporters of small forest enterprises such as <a href=\"http://www.treeaid.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Tree Aid</a>. But in the interim, Nununa members have circumscribed 3,345 hectares of shea-tree protection areas managed by their members. Enabling investment in business capacity development has come from the cosmetics company L'Occitane, which agreed a commercial deal to buy Shea from 600 women subject to certain quality specifications that then attracted technical partners for development such as the Centre for Study and International Co-operation and the Dutch Interchurch Organisation for Development.</p> <p>Enabling investment to achieve investible scale also came from SNV and Nununa itself. Nununa started as a union among 18 district-wide groups, but now comprises 4,596 members, a growth of 156% in comparison with 2,985 members in 2009. Technical support to achieve fairtrade certification in 2006 and organic certification in 2007 further strengthened the track record.</p> <p>Finally, enabling investment to broker a commercial deal came from SNV whose support to develop a new business model included an investment proposal for the construction of a small factory for the industrial processing of shea butter. A fully mechanised and more efficient production facility was installed with loan finance from the Agridius Foundation.</p> <p>Production costs per kilo of butter decreased by a half from 1.68 \u20ac/kg to 0.86 \u20ac/kg (\u00a31.4/kg to 0.69/kg) and production volumes doubled. More than 4,000 members have achieved a 95% increase in income from shea production for less work and more status.</p> <p>Investors are getting acceptable returns. Stronger roles and incentives for local women to control, sustainably manage and even enrich the shea forests have been put in place.</p> <p>Scaling-up can be seen to happen organically across very different forest contexts once this clever packaging of enabling and asset investment is understood and applied \u2013 as numerous cases in the <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/investment-guide-triple-win-locally-controlled-forestry\" title=\"\">guide to investing in locally controlled forestry</a> that was launched at <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/forestry/cofo/en/\" title=\"\">COFO21</a> attest. <a href=\"http://www.growingforestpartnerships.org/forest-farm-facility-mission-and-focus\" title=\"\">A new Forest and Farm Facility</a> hosted by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation was also launched at Committee on Forestry on 28 September precisely to start to inject the right sort of enabling investments into locally controlled forestry.</p> <p><em>Duncan Macqueen is team leader for forests at the </em><a href=\"http://www.iied.org/\" title=\"\"><em>International Institute for Environment and Development</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

They said jets targeted Harat al-Shwam, a residential neighbourhood a few kilometres east of the capital which President Bashar al-Assad's forces had tried to storm, encountering stiff resistance. Sham News Network, an activist group, said jets also raided farmland adjacent to the northern Damascus neighbourhood of Barzeh and the city of Deir al-Zor in eastern Syria.&#xa0;The ceasefire has been marred by air raids and fighting and, on Sunday, veteran opposition campaigner <a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o0qANYo1n4A\">Fawaz Tello told Reuters it was \u201cpractically over\u201d</a>. Syrian authorities blame \"terrorists\" for breaking the truce and the opposition says a ceasefire is impossible while Assad moves tanks and uses artillery and jets against populated areas.</p> <p>\u2022<strong> <a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/news-296477-turkey-strikes-syria-after-mortar-bomb-hits-hatay.html\">Turkey has fired on Syrian forces close to its border after a mortar bomb struck the southern Turkish district of </a><a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/news-296477-turkey-strikes-syria-after-mortar-bomb-hits-hatay.html\">Hatay Province, Today's Zaman reported</a></strong>. The bomb landed after clashes between Syrian regime forces and opposition fighters escalated in the Syrian town of Harim, it said. The state-run Anatolia news agency reported that the Turkish army responded immediately with artillery fire. Tensions between the neighbours increased earlier this month after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/03/turkey-syrian-mortar-bomb\">five Turkish civilians were killed by a mortar bomb fired from Syrian territory. </a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2012/10/29/Iraq-finds-no-arms-in-Syria-bound-Iran-jet/UPI-97561351492200/\"><strong>Iraq has searched an Iranian plane bound for Syria to check that it was not carrying weapons</strong>.</a> It was the second such forced landing this month. No weapons were found on the previous occasion either. The head of the Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority said the plane was released after they found only humanitarian aid on board. Iraq banned a North Korean plane from using its airspace on 20 September over suspicions it was carrying weapons to Syria.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>UN-Arab League peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi will visit China this week, the foreign ministry said</strong>. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said (via Reuters):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have consistently expressed our appreciation and support for Special Representative Brahimi and have proactively proposed that relevant parties in Syria respond to Brahimi's proposals for a ceasefire in Syria during the Eid al-Adha holiday period.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>When David Cameron made his keynote speech to the UN in September, he recognised property rights as one of the building blocks that take a country from poverty to prosperity. But for the vast majority of the world's poor, property rights or secure tenure are currently inaccessible.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.unhabitat.org/\" title=\"\">UN-Habitat</a>, only 30% of land in developing countries is regulated by some form of land registration system, and consequently 5 million people worldwide suffer forced evictions every year. With rapid urbanisation and slum development, where conventional tenure systems exist they simply cannot keep up.</p> <p>For many of the world's poorest communities \u2013 and particularly for women and indigenous groups within those communities \u2013 full titling to prove ownership of land is expensive and unattainable. Some governments have little experience of formulating and implementing land tenure policies.</p> <p>Demand for better access to land and for protection against eviction is increasing, yet large-scale, conventional individual land titling programmes are no longer appropriate. Although existing customary and religious land tenure systems are sometimes more accessible to local communities, they also have the tendency to discriminate against women and marginalised groups.</p> <p>The question is this: how can low income and vulnerable people access secure tenure? The answer requires inclusive, proactive and legal institutions and political structures \u2013 and the will.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.habitatforhumanity.org.uk\" title=\"\">Habitat for Humanity</a> is one of the 50 partners in UN-Habitat's <a href=\"http://www.gltn.net/\" title=\"\">global land tools network</a>, which is developing new approaches to ownership based on a continuum of land rights. Where previously residents would have only two options \u2013 undocumented, unrecognised informal land occupation or expensive, formal individual land titles \u2013 the network is trialling an approach that gives residents protection from eviction and is locally sensitive.</p> <p>The network is piloting a <a href=\"http://www.gltn.net/index.php/projects/social-tenure-domain-model\" title=\"\">social tenure domain model in Uganda</a>. It is using a survey, GPS system and a database to gather and analyse information, mapping community structures and facilities, family information, supporting documents and photos, and producing reports of the community and their land tenure situation.</p> <p>Part of the process is to build the capacity of the community in Uganda to input and update this system. The occupants are given a \"certificate of residency\" in recognition of their history within the space which gives them an address to access other services. Though it does not grant full land ownership, the certificate can be used to start a conversation with authorities on local planning and secure land tenure.</p> <p>Habitat for Humanity will be trialling the social tenure domain model in Bolivia and Brazil, where families have struggled for more than 20 years to access secure land tenure. The approach also have applications in countries such as Tajikistan where cultural constraints currently inhibit women's access to land tenure for housing. A system that recognises women's occupation in homes could start a process which then protects their tenancy.</p> <p>With land values rising, changing demographics, increasing inequalities and a growth in women-headed households, the traditional individual land titling system cannot deliver security of tenure to enough people within an acceptable time frame. The answer, I think, lies in changing the long unequal and unfair road of insecurity with new attitudes and policies to access secure tenure.</p> <p><em>Lisa Stead is assistant programme manager at </em><a href=\"http://www.habitatforhumanity.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>Habitat for Humanity</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis, best practice and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>",

Photograph: Theo Schneider/Demotix/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Theo Schneider/  Theo Schneider/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Good morning, and welcome to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/series/eurozone-crisis-live\">our rolling coverage of the eurozone debt crisis</a>, and other key events in the world economy.</p> <p>First up: <strong>Mario Draghi</strong> has given a rather fascinating interview to <strong><em>Der Spiege</em></strong>l in which the European Central Bank president defended his recent actions.</p> <p>Draghi told the German newspaper that eurozone states must accept the loss of some sovereignty in order to preserve the single currency. He denied that his massive liquidity schemes and promise of unlimited bond purchases would fuel inflation.</p> <p>Draghi also rejected claims that the European Central Bank has violated its mandate, and argued that German savers should be pleased, not alarmed \u2013 taxpayers might even make a profit on the ECB's bond purchases.</p> <p>A full transcript of the interview was <a href=\"http://www.ecb.int/press/key/date/2012/html/sp121029.en.html\">uploaded to the ECB's website this morning</a>. It begins with Spiegel inquiring whether the ex-Goldmanite has any savings (!) before giving Draghi a vigorous grilling.</p> <p>Here are some highlights.</p> <p>On sovereignty:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has proposed giving the EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs a direct say in national budgets. What do you think of that proposal?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> I am fully in favour of it. Governments would be wise to seriously consider it. I firmly believe that, in order to restore confidence in the euro area, countries need to transfer part of their sovereignty to the European level.</p> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> But it is precisely that that many governments are unwilling to do. Why are they so against it?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> A lot of governments have yet to realise that they lost their national sovereignty a long time ago. Because, in the past, they have allowed their debt to pile up, they now need the goodwill of the financial markets. That sounds like a paradox, but it is nonetheless true: it is only once the euro area countries are willing to share sovereignty at the European level that they will gain sovereignty.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on German fears:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> In Germany, people have several reservations about your crisis policies. Were you surprised to receive so much criticism?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> I had the opportunity of a very deep and wide-ranging exchange of views with members of the Bundestag last Wednesday. My impression was that I was able to explain a number of issues, in particular how the measures comply with our mandate to safeguard our independence and to ensure price stability in the medium term.</p> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> This fear stems from historical experience. Germans have learnt that, if central banks flood the markets with money, this always leads to inflation.</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> We have to take these fears very seriously. But the correlation is not so simple. In some cases, such as in the Weimar Republic, printing money caused inflation. But in other cases, proactive central bank action did not.</p> </blockquote> <p>Draghi is clearly keen to assuage German concerns \u2013 last Wednesday he spent two hours at the Bundestag answering MPs questions. <em>Preparing the ground before Angela Merkel seeks parliamentary approval for new support for Greece, Spain and/or Cyprus, perhaps....</em></p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p></p> <h2>Monday</h2> <h2>The Hospital That Stopped Caring \u2013 Panorama<br>8.30pm, BBC1</h2> <p>A Panorama report following up one of its more worthwhile investigations of recent times: the exposure of mistreatment of patients at the Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol. The hospital is now closed, with 11 of its staff facing sentencing as we go to press, but as this sequel shows, the trauma suffered by their victims goes on. Continuing the public health theme, over on Channel 4, Dispatches asks whether the outsourcing of NHS services to the private sector is going to do anybody but the contractors any good. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>50 Years Of Bond Cars: A Top <br>Gear Special<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Yet more 007-related programming as Richard Hammond discovers the stories behind Bond cars, which happily turn out to be more about actual people. From director Guy Hamilton's revenge on traffic wardens (the revolving numberplates in Dr No), to London bus driver Maurice Patchett (who stunt-doubled for Roger Moore in Live And Let Die), and the story of how the Lotus Esprit became a Bond car, this is a an enjoyable hour, helped by Hammond's enthusiasm for the material. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>999: What's Your Emergency?<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Blackpool's emergency services know all about alcohol and its consequences: with the town's reputation as a stag- and hen-party hub, the drunken behaviour at chucking-out time is really something to behold. \"A mixture between a zoo and Jeremy Kyle's waiting room,\" says one officer. But booze has more serious effects than idiots getting into fights: Blackpool is blighted by deprivation and associated alcohol abuse, and it's the prime cause of call-outs for all three emergency services, as is all too grimly illustrated here. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>Wizards vs Aliens<br>5.15pm, CBBC</h2> <p>New offering from Russell T Davies, centred around the partnership of Tom, the most popular boy in school with a talent for magic, with nerdy alien enthusiast Benny. Despite a sense that a bunch of wizards have taken the wrong portkey and wandered into the world of Doctor Who, there is potential in this opening episode, in which Tom must battle against an invasion of magic-stealing aliens to save the wizarding world. Older viewers will appreciate a peppering of witty references to the show's magical precedents, particularly the presence of a certain \"chamber\" in the downstairs toilet. <em>Indigo Axford</em></p> <h2>How the Devil Got His Horns: <br>A Diabolical Tale<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Why does Satan look like he does? It's a question tackled by Alastair Sooke as he considers depictions of Old Nick in the centuries leading up to the Renaissance, an exploration that takes in Giotto and Dante, among others. The Devil, we learn, was once seen rather as a bureaucrat. In times of trouble, though, he gradually came to be represented as a monstrous figure, with physical characteristics borrowed from Egyptian deity Bes. But such representations couldn't survive people empathising with the notion of the Devil as a tragic fallen angel. <em>JW</em></p> <h2>Don't Sit In The Front Row<br>9pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Jack Dee hosts a new panel show in which three comics mine four pre-selected members of the audience for joke-worthy material. After round one, they ditch the punter with the least comic potential and keep going until one audience member is the \"winner\". Although it's not clear why. Heavy reliance on members of the public recounting anecdotes slows things, and even with editing, there's too much dead air between laughs. You want someone to release a caffeinated monkey into the studio just to liven things up a bit. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <h2>Autumnwatch<br>8pm, BBC2</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398561115\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/25/1351181745460/Autumnwatch-010.jpg\" alt=\"Autumnwatch\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michaela Strachan and Chris Packham in Autumnwatch. Photograph: Emilie Sandy/BBC</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emilie Sandy/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's like The Only Way Is Essex of the animal world as the ever-chirpy Chris Packham, Michaela Strachan and Martin Hughes-Games show off nature at its seasonal best. They're based in the Scottish Highlands for four nights of live shows where anything \u2013 or indeed nothing \u2013 could happen. The beautiful location is ideal to showcase red squirrels scavenging, beavers getting ready for winter and a possible glimpse of the reclusive pine marten. Plus Packham gives a rundown on the wildlife winners and losers after the wettest summer for 100 years. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Operation Iceberg<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>\"If you think icebergs are nothing more than floating chunks of ice, prepare to think again.\" The narration for this two-parter on the life cycle of icebergs is ridiculously macho \u2013 obviously the BBC have spent a lot of money and effort getting their team to the Arctic, so they're not going to let anyone forget how important and dangerous the venture is. But there is a lot to learn and wonder at: little is really known about icebergs, so the scientists and specialists, fronted by that man Packham again, are breaking new ground with their research, while the photography is suitably dramatic. Concludes Thursday. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Jewish Mum Of The Year<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>They've had to organise a barmitzvah, hone their matchmaking skills, and rustle up a coach trip for 22 Jewish OAPs. In the final challenge, the two remaining Mums must lay on a Friday-night dinner of chicken soup for a party of 16, including David Baddiel and \u2013 no pressure \u2013 Jay Rayner. However, as the winner will become resident agony aunt with Jewish News, they must also prove their chutzpah on a radio phone-in. <em>Mazel tov</em> to them both. <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>Last Resort<br>8pm, Sky1</h2> <p>\"Just crazy enough,\" says one crew member to submarine captain Chaplin (Andre Braugher) after he has announced to the world that he's taking his nuclear sub, complete with crew and 18 Trident missiles, to a remote Pacific island and won't give them back 'til somebody gives him some answers. To questions like, why did a US ship apparently try to sink them? Just crazy enough also perfectly describes this pilot episode of the new US drama. A bonkers premise supported largely by Braugher's immense and capable shoulders \u2013 he's an acting exocet. <em>JNR</em></p> <h2>Horror Europa With Mark Gatiss<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>In this excellent sequel to 2010's History Of Horror, Mark Gatiss lifts the coffin lid on those nations outside the Hollywood system and the British gothic tradition \u2013 suggesting that Europe's turbulent 20th century impacted on continental horror in fascinating ways; from the tormented expressionism of Germany's Dr Caligari to France's guilt-ridden Les Diaboliques. There's plenty of room for lesser-known curios too, such as Spain's Living Dead At The Manchester Morgue \u2013 plus a chat with Italian giallo maestro Dario Argento, director of gob-smacking, \"hyper-violent fairytale\" Suspiria. <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>American Horror Story: Asylum<br>10pm, FX</h2> <p>What is scary? This show still isn't sure, but it's going to have a damn good time finding out. After the anything-goes attitude of season one, the second outing is more focused, with the action confined to a spooky institution for the criminally insane. It's run by Jessica Lange, returning in a different role. Oh, and we're now in the 1960s. So far, it's more confusing than scary, but it's impressive how quickly they establish this new environment and fill it with great actors including James Cromwell and Sarah Paulson. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <h2>Brazil With Michael Palin<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>\"I was born to swing from hooks,\" says Michael Palin. Not to worry, the eternally jolly traveller has simply come late in life to the joys of hammocks. As Palin explores Amazonia, one of these hammocks is slung up in a vast communal home shared by the Yanomami people, who manage to maintain a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the 21st century. Elsewhere, Palin makes friends with pink river dolphins, sees the remains of Henry's Ford's efforts to guarantee rubber supplies for his company and grooves to tecno brega. <em>JW</em></p> <h2>How Safe Are Britain's Roads?<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>In this two-part series, Justin Rowlatt and Anita Rani look at why the number of people harmed in traffic accidents is rising. After years of declining road casualties, the number of deaths is up \u2013 there were more injuries last year than make up the population of Northampton. Anita joins a police motorway patrol, while Justin takes his beaten-up people carrier to a test track to see how it compares with the latest technology. They also meet a Paralympian who says he wouldn't be in a wheelchair if he'd worn a seatbelt. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Frankenstein: A Modern Myth<br>11.10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>An insightful dissection of Mary Shelley's pioneering science fiction, pulling in references from 60s counterculture to Mel Brooks and Danny Boyle (whose stage production starred Benedict Cumberbatch). Her eloping with the married poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, who would become her husband, and holing up with Byron in the Swiss commune where her novel was spawned, was scandalous in its day. Born of such controversy, Frankenstein continues to resonate, we learn, in its examination of otherness and fear of technology. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Unsafe Sex In The City<br>9pm, BBC3</h2> <p>BBC3's behind-the-scenes look at a Manchester sexual health clinic is hopefully making for an effective public-information film \u2013 once you get beyond the ewww factor, the serious consequences of unprotected sex are clearly apparent. This week, a 20-year-old porn actor gets some bad news from the STI clinic, a woman in her 30s is afraid of being left infertile after contracting chlamydia as a teenager, and housemates Martin and Marissa argue over who is responsible for an outbreak of scabies. If it sounds gross, it's meant to \u2013 the message is if you can't be safe, keep it zipped. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Extreme Couponing: Holiday Hauls<br>9pm, Discovery Real Time</h2> <p>It's Boxing Day, and a dramatic voiceover follows a group of American bargain-lovers who are so obsessed with low prices they'll stop at nothing to raid the sales. \"If I'm five minutes late to the store, my whole game plan is off,\" says Joel, a teenager who should have better things to do. Faatima ropes in her long-suffering husband Brian, a sad man who shrugs: \"I'm a carrying tool.\" Meanwhile, Missy is so determined to fill her gift stockroom with a year's worth of presents for any occasion, she spends Christmas Day snipping coupons. All a bit weird. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>Getting On<br>10pm, BBC4</h2> <p>There's indecipherable streamlining going on at St Jude's, as the staff get \"cascade training\" \u2013 laden with meaningless buzzwords \u2013 from Damaris on saving energy and the new colour-coded (but not quite colour-coded enough) bags for the unspeakable waste that exudes from the wards. It's just what Den needs now that hypochondriac patient Mrs Dethick is back, and her pregnancy is beginning to weigh heavy. Meanwhile, Hilary is pinballing about the ward turning lights off. As ever, Jo Brand, Ricky Grover and Joanna Scanlan are pitch-perfect. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <h2>Young Apprentice<br>8pm, BBC1</h2> <p>No one wants to be a train driver any more. Or a nurse. Kids would rather be synergising bleeding-edge strategic deliverables or something. This week another 12 youngsters \u2013 some of whom will have swallowed a marketing dictionary and will spend the next couple of months guffing out the results \u2013 ship out to Baron Sugar's Brentwood HQ in the hopes of winning \u00a325,000 to kickstart their own business. There's a trainee accountant, a fashion designer, and an events promoter all set for Grumpole of the Bailey's intensive school of tasks; they'd do well to remember that, unlike the adult version, the nice kids always win. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Hunted<br>9pm, BBC1</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398561116\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/25/1351182753109/Hunted-010.jpg\" alt=\"Hunted\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hunted, BBC1. Photograph: Giles Keyte/BBC/Kudos</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Keyte/BBC/Kudos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As modern as it appears, with its thin laptops and cloned tracking devices, the appeal of Hunted is equally thanks to some old-school cold-war devices. Hypodermic needles, hidden rooms, clandestine meetings: were it not for all the mobile phone calls, this could be taking place in 1974. Even if the Russian doll nature of private espionage agent Sam Hunter's identity and fate remains a mystery, tonight's episode offers an excellent explanation of what \"Hourglass\" might be, and more of the show's customarily great set pieces. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>The Human Mannequin<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Teenager Louise Wedderburn has a rare genetic condition known as FOP, which is slowly causing her muscle to turn into bone. Nevertheless, as this documentary shows, she's determined to make a career in one of the most image-conscious professions of all \u2013 fashion \u2013 and sets off to London for an internship at Elle. \"I don't want to be one of those people that let their illness get them down,\" she asserts. It's hugely touching and inspiring stuff. AJC</p> <h2>Family Guns<br>8pm, National Geographic</h2> <p>Hard to see what exactly is Geographic about this new series about a father-and-son firm of small-arms traders \u2013 cannon, rifles, flamethrowers, they've got the lot \u2013 who are always bickering in a staged way to camera because the old man can't bear to sell the choicest items in the inventory. It's essentially an excuse for sequences in which guys get to shoot off demonstration rounds of bullets, grinning with ejaculatory delirium as they do so. For boys and small men only. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>The Year The Town Hall Shrank<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>A timely three-part series filmed over a year in Stoke-on-Trent, charting the reactions of local politicians and voters alike as spending cuts begin to bite. This opening episode begins in December 2010 with the reactions of councillors as they absorb a \u00a336m shortfall in council finances caused by an 8.1% cut in government funding. Stoke's council is arguably bloated \u2013 it's the city's biggest employer \u2013 but this is likely to prove little consolation to those who depend, one way or another, on its services. An absorbing study of politics at its most mundane, and most important. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Scandal<br>9pm, More4</h2> <p>A cross between The Good Wife and Boston Legal, Scandal takes political/legal dilemmas and punches them up with snappy dialogue. You join us in the offices of Olivia Pope, whose legal firm specialises in making problems go away, and in tonight's episode, the problem turns out to be Washington DC's most high-end madam, keen to protect her client list in the face of an indictment. There's lots of fun as the coded \"menu\" of services is explained to members of the team, but when one client turns out to be the president's nominee for attorney general, this proves to be an assignment with implications that go all the way to the top. <em>JR</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Friday</h2> <h2>Jonathan And Charlotte<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>The commercial success guaranteed by triumph on TV talent quests might well be one of the more baffling phenomena of our epoch but it shows few signs of slowing. Essex teenagers Jonathan &amp; Charlotte, despite being beaten into second place on Britain's Got Talent this year by a dancing dog, have managed to become reasonably \u2013 if fleetingly \u2013 famous for their classical crossover warblings. This hagiography recaps their story so far, with frequent reminders that they have an album out. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Derren Brown: Apocalypse<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Some Hollywood concepts are so bad that no director could reasonably expect their audience to succumb to suspension of disbelief, yet Darren Brown aims to breakdance where Michael Bay fears to tread in this, the concluding half of a two-part special. Last week introduced us to the stooge who'll find themselves believing they're one of a smattering of survivors from a meteor slamming into Earth; this closing part sees them bumble around a post-apocalyptic Blighty strewn with the undead. What ever happens, fingers crossed they don't just think \"when in Rome\" and tuck into the nearest noggin. <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <h2>The Mentalist<br>9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>A new season, a new opportunity for this show to stretch out its long-standing case of the Red John serial killer. At least the team have caught Lorelei, Red John's accomplice, so we can surely expect a little headway. Yet the show is still torn between its long story arc and the more mundane case-of-the-week stuff, which tends to get in the way a bit. Taking up a chunk of time this week is a head-scratcher involving the murder of a hotel employee, which sees the CBI team grudgingly pair up with the FBI. <em>PO'N</em></p> <h2>Lang Lang: Live At The Roundhouse<br>7.30pm, BBC4</h2> <p>He's got a little Liszt. Actually, he's gotta whole lotta Listz: nine solo piano pieces from the Hungarian composer, including La Campanella and Un Sospiro, effortlessly performed by Chinese wunderkind Lang Lang at Camden Town's renowned Roundhouse as part of last year's iTunes festival. It's followed by Lang Lang: The Art Of Being A Virtuoso, a behind-the-scenes doc following the seemingly 12-fingered young prodigy through China, the US and Europe, as he discusses which composers caught his ear in his formative years. Guessing that'll be Listz, then. <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>Modern Family<br>8pm, Sky1</h2> <p>Claire's big plans for Halloween, her favourite of all the holidays, are stymied by the neighbours after one of her previous spook-taculars proved a little too shocking for the more faint-hearted local residents. Phil declares an open house, which may test Claire's promise not to scare. Meanwhile, Jay and Manny have to deal with true horror as they face a hot- and cold-running Gloria whose pregnancy hormones are running wild. A reminder of what a shame it is that British shows don't do Halloween specials. <em>PO'N</em></p> <h2>Taste Off<br>9pm, Discovery Real Time</h2> <p>Frisky London chef Aaron Craze holds his fists aloft in a gesture reminiscent of a gooning 90s TV presenter and challenges locals to a taste off. It's a bold move that sees the ex-Fifteen employee learn from chefs around the world and then add his own twist on their dishes. Although he doesn't always win the challenge, and looks suitably gutted when he fails, Craze has every reason to be cocky as he gives Mexican food an Italian twist by making tortilla into tortellini. Also on the menu: blue corn quesadilla, alcoholic cactus juice and taco with coriander foam. <em>HV</em></p>",

  "<p>Amid warnings that land deals are undermining food security, the head of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has compared \"land grabs\" in Africa to the \"wild west\", saying a \"sheriff\" is needed to restore the rule of law.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva, the FAO's director general, conceded it was not possible to stop large investors buying land, but said deals in poor countries needed to be brought under control.</p> <p>\"I don't see that it's possible to stop it. They are private investors,\" said Graziano da Silva in a telephone interview. \"We do not have the tools and instruments to stop big companies buying land. Land acquisitions are a reality. We can't wish them away, but we have to find a proper way of limiting them. It appears to be like the wild west and we need a sheriff and law in place.\"</p> <p>Large land deals have accelerated since the surge in food prices in 2007-08, prompting companies and sovereign wealth funds to take steps to guarantee food supplies. But, four to five years on, in Africa only 10-15% of land is actually being developed, claimed Graziano da Silva. Some of these investments have involved the loss of jobs, as labour intensive farming is replaced by mechanised farming or some degree of loss of tenure rights.</p> <p>Oxfam said the <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/grow/pressroom/pressrelease/2012-10-04/land-sold-last-decade-could-grow-enough-food-feed-billion-people\" title=\"\">global land rush is out of control</a> and urged the World Bank to freeze its investments in large-scale land acquisitions to send a strong signal to global investors to stop.</p> <p>Graziano da Silva, who was in charge of Brazil's widely praised \"zero hunger\" programme, expressed his frustration at the slow pace of creating a global governance structure to deal with land grabs, food security and similar problems. In 2008, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/issues/food/taskforce/\" title=\"\">created a high-level task force on food security</a> on which Graziano Da Silva serves as vice-chairman.</p> <p>In May, the committee on world food security (CFS), a UN-led group that includes governments, business and civil society, laid the groundwork for a governance structure for food by endorsing <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/\" title=\"\">voluntary guidelines on the responsible governance of tenure of land, fisheries and forests</a>.</p> <p>Tenure has important implications for development, as it is difficult for poor and vulnerable people to overcome hunger and poverty when they have limited and insecure rights to land and other natural resources. But the guidelines took years to negotiate and lack an effective enforcement mechanism because they are voluntary. The CFS is an unwieldy group but has the virtue of inclusivity.</p> <p>\"It took two years to discuss the voluntary guidelines and now we face another two years of negotiations on the principles for responsible agricultural investments,\" said Graziano da Silva. \"We need to speed up the decison-making process without losing the inclusivity model.\"</p> <p>The FAO director general said he is doing his best to bring about more co-ordination among the different institutions concerned with food security and suggests the FAO act like an executive arm of the CFS, trying to implement its decisions.</p> <p>Others share his frustrations. Olivier De Schutter, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, acknowledges the importance of the CFS voluntary guidelines, but points out the lack of an effective enforcement mechanism. He argues <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/mar/02/african-governments-land-deals\" title=\"\">that governments in sub-Sahran Africa or south-east Asia with poor governance, or tainted by corruption, will continue to seek to attract investors at all costs</a>.</p> <p>\"The international community should accept it has a role in monitoring whether the rights of land users, as stipulated in the guidelines, are effectively respected,\" De Schutter told the Guardian. \"Since there is no 'sheriff' at global level to achieve this, at the very least, the home states of investors should exercise due diligence in ensuring that private investors over which they can exercise control fully respect the rights of land users. Export credit agencies, for example, should make their support conditional upon full compliance with the guidelines, and in the future, the rights of investors under investment treaties should be made conditional upon the investors acting in accordance with the guidelines.\"</p> <p>For Graziano da Silva, the key is the implementation of the voluntary guidelines at country level; he is encouraged by growing public interest and awareness of the issue. He points to Uruguay as an example of a government prepared to stand up to international land investors \u2013 \"perhaps the best sheriff\" on land deals.</p> <p>\"They have very good laws on land acquisitions,\" he said, but acknowledged that most countries where land grabbing takes place have little consultation with farmer organisations or have weak or repressive governments.</p> <p>As for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/23/talk-point-farming-crossroads-future-agriculture\" title=\"\">the perennial debate</a> on the respective merits of large- and small-scale farming, the FAO boss said Africa had room for both, adding that Brazil had managed it.</p> <p>\"In some areas of Africa \u2013 Mozambique and South Africa \u2013 there is scope for large farms, but this approach is only valid for some grains, where the entire cycle is mechanical,\" he said. \"But this is not suitable for fruits, vegetables or many other local products. Cassava has nothing to do with mechanised agriculture and efficiency does not mean big scale. It's the way you combine crops, the use of water you have available. In Africa today, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2012/oct/12/seed-diversity-food-security-in-pictures\" title=\"\">efficiency means better seeds</a> rather than big tractors. The two models have been there forever in agriculture. Sometimes big-scale will provide exports, but local markets are based on small-scale agriculture.\"</p>",
  "<p>Agreements between government agencies and a growing battalion of not-for-profit service provider partners will be ever more crucial in a future of cost-conscious, diverse service provision. Saying what you mean and meaning what you say in commercial agreements has always been vital and since 1998 the<a href=\"http://www.compactvoice.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> Compact</a> \u2013 the memorandum of understanding between Government and voluntary sector \u2013 promotes that process. Compliance with the Compact will be even more important in the future than it is today.</p> <p>When Ken Stowe, Paul Boateng and I sounded the fanfares at the Compact's launch, Full Cost Recovery in contracts was not even mentioned. Within five years pressure from charities made its inclusion inevitable. Then the new government undertook its own Compact review in 2010.</p> <p>The absence of 'big society' from current headlines does not mean that transfer of risk away from the centre is no longer happening. With cash cuts and changes in local authority personnel rampant, in an increasingly competitive service delivery environment, the Compact is one of the few defences the third sector has - yet confidence is regularly undermined by consultation timetables which make a mockery of Compact guidelines.</p> <p>Local authorities are bearing the brunt of spending cuts, the speed of which is making their staff and organisers of service-delivering charities dizzy. Relationships between commissioning officers and service providers, built up over years, shatter as Council personnel lose their jobs. Nationwide, the cuts have had unpredictable, non-strategic impacts allowing Government to say 'it was up to councils to decide their priorities'.</p> <p>Yet this is a dip from which services will bounce back as the economy stabilises. We will see a change in the balance of devolved power as the fruits of localism take root. Cash going into the third sector by then is likely to be at a similar level to five or six years ago, though things will look very different.</p> <p>In future local authorities will be the principal co-ordinators of service provision. Their role will be to ensure standards, value for money and equity (especially for those in most need and the most isolated) and to 'carry the can'. They will be the principal commissioners of services but will often be providers only where there is a lack of suitable quality or capacity available from elsewhere. Service delivery will be increasingly focused on the needs of individual users and localities, a 'retail' approach rather than 'wholesale'. Service-providing partners will be from all sectors with increasing contributions from consortia of smaller charities, private / third sector partnerships, social enterprises and mutuals, especially in-house employee mutuals. Organisations who mentor or increase the capacity of charities and voluntary organisations will be needed and will flourish.</p> <p>The 2010 Compact was compact indeed compared to its predecessor; memoranda of agreement between future councils and charities will be longer. Service level agreements will take on contractual status, KPIs will move to centre stage and innovative ways will emerge to relieve charities of the high risk endemic in Payment By Results contracts. Commissioning guidelines, such as those developed by<a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/\" title=\"\"> DWP</a>, will need to be revisited - any assessment which suggests that the current Work Programme is either fair to charities or sustainable clearly fails.</p> <p>From next year the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/3/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Social Value Act</a> will ensure that those local authorities who wish to be explicit about the public benefit of their contracts will be able to pursue best practice; while those who do not want to can merely note the possibility.</p> <p>One lesson we must learn is that any contract is only as good as its weakest clause. A council which is not committed to justice, equity and community capacity building will not tie itself tightly enough to the spirit of that contract; a private sector operator which prioritises base values external to those of a partnership to which they are supposed to be committed will avoid such ties like the plague. A private/third sector Compact is ever more necessary.</p> <p>It will be a cost-cutting, nit picking, book-driven environment for a while. There will be failures. Regulation will be imperfect. Whether we like it or not we are in a state of transition and the public service ethos of the future will be different to that of the past. Only by keeping our nerve, choosing our partners carefully and making Compacts and other agreements truly address the needs of service beneficiaries will we ensure that the future ethos of public service is better than the sometimes grey one of the past.</p> <p><em>Tom Levitt is a writer and consultant on third sector issues.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Overseas governments have intensified their interest in the tax affairs of foreign nationals based in the UK as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/07/tax-evasion-global-action\" title=\"\">the global crackdown on tax evasion</a> picks up pace.</p> <p>The number of requests for information about taxpayers received by the UK government from overseas tax authorities rose by 18% in the last year, according to law firm Pinsent Masons. Such requests are used to see whether rich individuals are making honest statements to domestic tax authorities about their global assets.</p> <p>HMRC received the most requests for information from Norway, followed by France and Spain.</p> <p>Phil Berwick, director at Pinsent Masons, said: \"The jump in requests shows there are very few places to hide for wealthy individuals who may be trying to avoid tax by moving their assets around the globe. International borders are increasingly meaningless for tax authorities' pursuit of outstanding taxes.</p> <p>\"London attracts ultra-high net worth individuals from a huge range of countries, and the expertise of London in wealth management makes it a stable 'haven' for individuals looking to protect their assets from political or economic instability overseas.\"</p> <p>Tax evasion has become harder to pull off in recent years with international bilateral partnerships. Legislation designed to fight terrorism and money-laundering has also made it easier for countries to share information.</p>",
  "<p>They started making them in the town in the 1880s, when they were said to have been enjoyed by Queen Victoria, and have been enjoyed by racegoers ever since.</p> <p>But now Newmarket sausages <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/food/protected-names/\" title=\"\">have become the 50th British food product</a> to earn European recognition for their quality, history and links with the local area.</p> <p>After a lengthy consultation, the Suffolk-based banger will carry a badge declaring its protected geographical indication (PGI) status.</p> <p>The bid, first launched 10 years ago, has been protracted because one local producer did not want to divulge the recipe.</p> <p>The PGI is one of three European designations used to protect local foods, which include Gorgonzola, Parmesan-Reggiano cheese, Parma ham and Champagne. The latest announcement means that the sausage now joins these, and other British products such as Cornish clotted cream, Melton Mowbray pork pies, Whitstable oysters and Arbroath smokies on the list.</p> <p>Food and farming minister David Heath said: \"Not only are PGIs important for keeping traditional foods and recipes alive, they also make a significant contribution to the local and national economy. The recipe for the Newmarket sausage is unchanged since the days of Queen Victoria and the original recipe has been passed down the generations. This is yet another example of the quality of British foods and we can be justly proud of the position of our produce in the international market.\"</p> <p>The UK Protected Food Names Association estimates that recognised products are worth around \u00a31bn every year in sales and other benefits.</p> <p>Melton Mowbray pork pies and Stilton cheese for example, close neighbours in the Leicestershire area, bring in an estimated \u00a3100m in sales and tourism.</p> <p>Matthew O'Callaghan, chairman of the UK Protected Food Names Association said: \"Having had some part to play in this application, I am delighted that it has gained approval. It shows what producers can achieve once they agree to work together to protect their food heritage.\"</p> <p>The new agreement specifies that Newmarket sausages must be made in or close to the Suffolk town and contain a minimum of 70% pork and 3% seasoning, which includes white pepper, black pepper, thyme, parsley and nutmeg.</p> <p>Chris Sheen, chairman of the Newmarket Sausage Association and managing director of Newmarket sausage producer Musk's, commented: \"This is something that has been in the pipeline for some time. It will help protect the reputation of regional foods, promote rural and agricultural activity within the Newmarket area and it recognises the status and longevity of the product.\"</p> <p>Grant Powter, managing director of local producer Powters, said: \"I am delighted that this regional food product has now gained the protection it deserves by virtue of the reputation and quality which have been traditionally attributed to the making of sausages in Newmarket for more than 150 years.\"</p> <p>Under the EU's protected food name scheme, which came into force in 1993, food or drink registered at European level will get legal protection against imitation throughout the union.</p> <p>But not all British bangers have enjoyed such success. An application to give the Lincolnshire sausage special protection was turned down by the government earlier this year because there were already \"too many variations\" across the UK.</p> <p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found there was no enduring link between the product and the county, stating that they had been made elsewhere for more than 20 years. An appeal failed last month.</p>",
  "<p>The United Nations is to announce ambitious plans to eliminate child labour by 2020 after research revealed high growth in developing nations will not substantially reduce the number of children working worldwide.</p> <p>Warning that \"current trends are \u2026 of great concern\" the UN says there will still be about 190 million child labourers in eight years' time \u2013 a drop of just 25 million on today's figures. Even worse is that in the poorest parts of the world, the UN says, the numbers will rise: child labourers in sub-Saharan Africa will jump by around 15 million over the next decade, reaching 65 million by 2020.</p> <p>A UN report \u2013 to be launched on Monday morning by the UN's special envoy on education, the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown \u2013 warns that unless the issue is tackled, the internationally agreed millennium development goal that all children should complete primary school by 2015 will not be achieved. Child labour, the UN says, \"exacerbates the risk of being out of school. In India, non-attendance rates for child labourers are twice the level for children not involved in child labour.\"</p> <p>The research says the \"sheer scale of child labour is not widely recognised\". About 60 million under-17-year-olds are involved in global agriculture. Mining, it says, is a \"magnet\" for child labour, with children as young as six digging shafts and scuttling around mounds of rock with little more than a hammer and chisel. Around half of the workforce in Afghanistan's brick kilns is aged under 14. In Ethiopia almost 60% of children work.</p> <p>Multinational companies also come under fire. The report points out that in China, underage labour recruited by networks of agents from poor rural areas \"has been found in factories supplying companies such as Apple, Samsung and Google\".</p> <p>It also chides industry for failing in the past to keep its side of the bargain in tackling the problem. US chocolate companies, the UN notes, had promised to educate all children in areas where it grew cocoa in west Africa \u2013 a commitment that would cost the industry $75m or 0.1% of annual sales. Instead it spent about $20m over eight years and reached just 4% of children in cocoa-growing communities in Ivory Coast and 30% in Ghana.</p> <p>The UN says that the first step would be to make education compulsory for all children \u2013 and perhaps go as far as paying families to send their children to school, an approach that has worked in Brazil. This would mean that by 2015 an extra $13bn in funding would be needed.</p> <p>Many children are forced to combine education and employment, and are consequently more likely to drop out, to complete fewer years in school and to achieve lower test scores. The UN warns that child labourers suffer a 17% achievement gap with non-working children in language and maths.</p> <p>Despite a host of international treaties and domestic laws prohibiting child labour in poorer nations, authorities rarely have the will \u2013 or the money \u2013 to enforce them.</p> <p>Brown told the Guardian that child labour was the \"new slavery\" for our age. \"Efforts to combat child labour are failing in the face of inertia, indifference and an indefensible willingness on the part of too many governments, international agencies and aid donors to turn a blind eye,\" he writes in the foreword to the report.</p> <p>The UN's roadmap takes its inspiration from how Victorian Britain first came to terms with \u2013 and then eradicated \u2013 child labour in the 19th century. The country began by offering education to child workers in the 1830s, then banned children from working in hazardous conditions a decade later. By the 1880s Britain was imposing heavy fines on industries for employing children.</p> <p>The report's author, Kevin Watkins, a former UN official who now works at the respected Washington-based thinktank the Brookings Institution, said: \"The conditions of millions of child labourers would shock even the most hardened Victorian social reformers. National governments and international agencies are failing these kids, and reneging on their commitments.\"</p>",
  "<p>Coal is enjoying a renaissance, with the highest consumption of the fuel since the late 1960s. The unexpected development threatens to put climate change targets out of reach \u2013 and much of the reason is the rise of a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/may/29/gas-rebranded-green-energy-eu\" title=\"\">supposedly \"green\" fuel, natural gas</a>.</p> <p>The<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/natural-gas-fracking-fires-protest\" title=\"\"> controversial use of shale gas in the US</a>, where it now makes up a quarter of electricity generation, has brought down carbon emissions there \u2013 but the greenhouse gases have simply been exported elsewhere, meaning no net gain for the planet, research by the Guardian and other sources has found.</p> <p>As gas power has replaced coal in the US, the excess coal has pushed down prices on world markets, sparking a bonanza for the high-carbon fuel. Last year, coal had its best year in more than four decades, according to the World Coal Association.</p> <p>Its global share of primary energy consumption rose from about 25%, where it has been for years, to 30% \u2013 the highest level since 1969, long before governments made any efforts to tackle climate change.</p> <p>Green campaigners are concerned by the findings. Guy Shrubsole, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \"This shows that if we want to avoid devastating climate change, we have to leave the fossil fuels in the ground, and go instead for clean energy sources.\" And Vinuta Gopal from Greenpeace said: \" Coal is the fuel of the past not the future.\"</p> <p>In the UK, between the second quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2012, coal consumption rose by nearly a quarter. Europe overall has burned more coal in the past year than any time since it pledged steep emissions cuts, and China and India have also been burning more. Cheap coal, caused by weakening demand in the US where power stations have switched fuels to use gas, has been the biggest factor.</p> <p>The role of shale gas in this bonanza has been overlooked by supporters of the controversial fuel. In the US, which has pioneered the technology of fracking \u2013 whereby rocks are blasted apart under huge pressure to release natural gas \u2013 the resulting gas has been championed as a green fuel because it emits half the carbon of coal when burned.</p> <p>Fracking has cut the US's greenhouse gas emissions to their lowest level since 1992, as power stations across the country have switched to gas from coal. That switch may even enable the US to meet its international climate change target of cutting emissions by 17% compared with 2005 levels, as agreed at the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009.</p> <p>But if the use of gas in the US is bringing down emissions there, the opposite is the case elsewhere. Cheap coal has flooded Europe, driving up consumption.</p> <p>A report from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, at the University of Manchester, published on Monday, found carbon dioxide emissions from domestic energy in the US fell by 8.6% from 2005, the equivalent of 1.4% per year. But more than half of the power sector emissions were displaced overseas by the trade in coal.</p> <p>John Broderick, lead author on the Tyndall Centre report, said predictions of a golden age of gas created by fracking technology were misplaced. He warned: \"We must seriously consider whether a so-called golden age would be little more than a gilded cage, locking us into a high-carbon future.\"</p> <p>Chris Shearlock, sustainable development manager at the Co-operative, which commissioned the Tyndall Centre report, said: \"The proponents of shale gas have always claimed that it is a lower carbon alternative to coal. However, this is only true if the coal it displaces remains in the ground and isn't just burnt elsewhere. Without a cap on global carbon emissions, shale gas is burnt in addition to other fossil fuels, increasing total emissions.\"</p> <p>Another reason for the resurgence of coal in Europe has been the failure of the European Union's main climate change mechanism, the, to stop the rise in coal use. The price of carbon permits is extraordinarily low under the scheme, which was intended to penalise the burning of high-carbon fuels, forcing companies to use modern technologies and become more efficient. Low permit prices take away that incentive.</p> <p>Paul Newman, managing director of ICAP Energy, a London brokerage, said: \"With prices at 18-month lows, everyone feels a bit more inclined to use coal at the moment. [The low permit price] is encouraging people to shoulder shrug, and say \"We'll just go ahead and use coal\". That is the signal that the emissions market is giving off.\"</p> <p>Coal is the highest carbon emitter of the major fossil fuels, and had been in long-term decline until last year, as governments around the world put in place goals to cut emissions and stave off the worst effects of global warming. Its return to favour \u2013 in Europe, in particular, which has some of the world's strongest regulations on greenhouse gases \u2013 could spell the end for any hopes of avoiding dangerous climate change. Scientists say emissions must peak within the next five years if the worst effects of global warming are to be avoided.</p> <p>Consumption of coal has risen by 8.4% in developing countries, according to the International Energy Agency. Newman said: \"Coal is the commodity of choice for those who want exposure to the electrification of the developing world.\"</p> <p>Milton Catelin, chief executive of the World Coal Association, said coal use was likely to continue to increase, and could help to lift people out of poverty. He said the way to tackle climate change was to capture the carbon dioxide from power stations and store it permanently underground. But he pointed out that carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology was receiving less investment than other low-carbon technologies \u2013 the Global Subsidies Initiative has found that nuclear and renewable energy projects (excluding hydro-electricity) receive $45bn (\u00a328bn) and $27bn in subsidies respectively each year. In comparison, since 2005, only $12.2bn had been made available in total to fund CCS demonstration. \"That is serious underfunding,\" Catelin said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398497511\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/10/28/1351446355698/US-coal-export-destinatio-004.png\" alt=\"US coal export destinations\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Destinations of US coal Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>"
