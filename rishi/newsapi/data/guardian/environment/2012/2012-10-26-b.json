  "<p>Ken Clarke, the minister without portfolio, has warned his government colleagues over their \"reckless\" and \"threatening\" statements about Britain's relations with the European Union.</p> <p>He said he did not understand the theory expounded by some of his colleagues that Britain's economic difficulties were caused by the EU.</p> <p>David Cameron has said he will seek a \"fresh settlement\" of Britain's relations with the EU after the election and the education secretary, Michael Gove, is reported to have said that the UK should use the threat of possible withdrawal as a weapon in negotiations.</p> <p>\"To start threatening, throwing into the air our relationship with the outside world, with the global economy, would I think be very reckless,\" Clarke told the Daily Telegraph. \"I frequently say that to several of my colleagues: there seems little point in opening up the debate at the moment about our membership of the European Union.\"</p> <p>Despite the problems in the eurozone, Britain's economic difficulties were caused by \"the folly of bankers, the uselessness of regulators and the weakness of government\", Clarke said. \"The idea that somehow the present problems are caused by Britain's membership of the European Union is a theory that I can't quite follow.\"</p> <p>Although better-than-expected growth of 1% in the third quarter of 2012 was announced earlier this week, Clarke said it was too early to be certain the economy is bouncing back. He said married couples should not expect the tax relief proposed by the Conservatives in their 2010 manifesto which promised a transferable tax allowance that could be worth \u00a3150 a year to couples where one spouse stays at home.</p> <p>Clarke, a former chancellor, said there was \"a long hard road\" ahead and that the tax allowance was not a government commitment.</p> <p>\"It would be absolute folly to turn around and say it will all be fine by Christmas,\" he said. \"Anybody who says we are absolutely certain we are bouncing back to strong growth is being very optimistic.</p> <p>\"We never committed ourselves to married couples' tax by the end of the parliament. I'm married, I'm not counting on it. I don't remember anyone promising that kind of thing.\"</p>",
  "<p>I'm an accidental landlady and it's giving me a headache. Of all the aspects of being Dad's power of attorney, property management is perhaps the one that makes me feel most out of my depth. I know, I know \u2013 it's not hard. I just need to be organised. But for some reason, I seem to have a mental block.</p> <p>In part it's because I've been spoilt thus far. A letting agent in Penzance deals with his property there. A family friend, she has held my hand through repeated floods, disputes about noise and extensive renovations; insulating me from the realities.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the London flat he owns has been rented by my younger sister, who dealt with any problems herself as they arose. But she decided to move back to Cornwall recently, and since then the questions have piled up.</p> <p>Should I go with the cut-throat lettings agent who will get the most rent but charge a staggering commission?</p> <p>Or should I advertise it on Facebook and put friends of friends in there at a lower rate, in the hope they won't ring me up every five minutes?</p> <p>Then there's the boiler safety check to organise, the energy certificate, the paint job, getting keys to new tenants, the contract, whether I need to provide more furniture, the mould from an old damp problem \u2026</p> <p>And don't get me started on the tenancy deposit protection scheme. The mere mention of it makes me feel queasy.</p> <p>Instead of being decisive, I've been approaching the whole thing as if shuffling towards an unpinned grenade.</p> <p>Partly, it's because I don't want to make a silly mistake; but there's something else too. I feel at one remove from the responsibility. As if owning it properly will mean that I've conceded that Dad can't do it himself. That he will never be able to do such things ever again.</p> <p>There's a chunk of me that still feels like the child in this scenario. Even though I'm aware my father struggles to feed himself, I'm still hoping he might sweep in and take charge. Make everything OK.</p> <p>It's a fantasy. Even fighting fit, Dad wasn't especially organised about such affairs, and his knowledge of the London rental market was far worse than mine.</p> <p>He bought the flat as an investment when he retired, on my advice, and only visited it a handful of times. It's on an Islington side street, as resolutely urban an environment as you can imagine. A world away from the vista he was used to: fields, country lanes, the ticker tape of cobalt sea on the horizon.</p> <p>I don't think he liked it especially, couldn't imagine why anyone would ever want to live in such a place. Indeed, he would probably have sought my opinion on the best route to take in letting it.</p> <p>I long, nonetheless, to ask for his advice, to defer to the familial hierarchy that's been routed so unexpectedly. Luckily, other family members have stepped in to help. Seeing me flailing and being vague, I think they realised they had to. The sister who vacated it has found some acquaintances interested in a six-month let. My mother rang around to find a plumber who could do the boiler safety certificate. She has also rounded up the keys and is ringing around handymen.</p> <p>Their help has spurred me into action. I've just downloaded an online tenancy agreement and set a time to get it signed. Just don't ask me about the deposit protection scheme. I'm working up to&#xa0;that.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Follow Rebecca on Twitter, </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rebeccahelenley\" title=\"\"><em>@rebeccahelenley</em></a></p>",
  "<p>It should be party time for the Germans with growth better than the rest of the EU and unemployment at its lowest level since 1991. But the mood is definitely subdued. Conversation is not about what they should do with their money, but where is it? Economists consider it as the model for Europe, but if you look beyond the record export figures and company profits, you see a very different picture.</p> <p>Germany might be getting richer, but the average German is getting poorer. According to a recent study by the University of Duisburg-Essen's Institute for Work, Skills and Training, those earning less than \u20ac9.15 (\u00a37.40) per hour actually increased by 2.3 million to 8 million between 1995 and 2010. Of the total workforce, 23% of employees make less than \u20ac9.15 per hour and the gross monthly salary for 800,000 is less than \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3808).</p> <p>\"While conditions for employees working directly in the export economy are generally good, those in the domestic economy, particularly the service sector, are often badly paid and have poor job security and that trend is growing. Women and young people are particularly badly affected,\" says Claus Matecki, federal executive board member at the Confederation of German Trade Unions (Der Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund, DGB).</p> <p>Germany was once famous for its social market economy (Soziale Marktwirtschaft), a policy that ensured workers, industry and the state existed in a highly-productive symbiosis. But since the mid-1990s, that has eroded. Privatisation, deregulation, labour reforms and the growth of temporary employment and outsourcing have all undermined the position of employees, particularly in unskilled jobs. \"The challenges of the future are to increase protection for those on short-term contracts and to get a minimum wage of \u20ac8.50 per hour,\" says Matecki.</p> <p>Incredibly, Germany still has no mandatory minimum wage. According to the DGB, based on legally-employed workers, there are now 1.4 million receiving less than \u20ac4 (\u00a33.23) per hour, 1&#xa0;million are on short-term contracts and 7 million are so-called mini-jobbers, earning \u20ac400 per month \u00a3323) and 70% of them have no other job. Taking those numbers into consideration, Germany's impressive employment figure loses a lot of its shine. \"Many workers in unskilled jobs are working at subsistence level and have to receive state subsidies to survive. In effect, the employers are using the state to pay their employees,\" Matecki points out.</p> <p>Many sectors have, nevertheless, agreed on a minimum wage system. For example, skilled workers in the construction industry earn \u20ac13.40 per hour, while the unskilled earn \u20ac11.05. Trainers in vocational education earn \u20ac12.60 an hour; cleaners only \u20ac8.82.&#xa0;However, if a company is not a member of a trade association, then it is not&#xa0;obliged to pay the going rate.</p> <p>Temporary workers get a particularly bad deal. Many take a temporary contract in the hope that it will lead to full-term employment, but it rarely does. Instead, the contract is renewed, not only reducing the wage bill but also avoiding costly severance terms.</p> <p>The argument that paying a minimum wage will reduce employment and competitiveness is one that business likes to revert to, but it contradicts the evidence, says Gerhard Bosch, professor of employment and economic sociology at Duisburg-Essen University: \"In many branches there are minimum wage agreements and comprehensive independent research has shown that does not lead to job losses. In fact, you can argue that good wages create employment.\"</p> <p>The fact that 50% of the population has no forms of savings or assets shows that low pay is not just a problem restricted to the unskilled sector, either. Children, too, are suffering. In Unicef's latest report on child poverty in rich countries, Germany is ranked 15 in terms of child deprivation, behind the UK (nine) and Spain (12).</p> <p>Although its labour reforms might be hurting, some economists say the medicine is necessary. \"We were the sick man of Europe six years ago,\" points out Dr Joachim Scheide, head of the forecasting centre at The Kiel Institute for the World Economy. \"Our reforms have made it easier for people to find work. While pay and employment terms may not be as generous, at least people are working \u2013 most countries envy us for that.\"</p> <p>But the laissez-faire wage policy is now worrying many Germans like Andreas M, 62, a former technical sales manager at electronics and electrical engineering giant Siemens, now retired. \"I got a very favourable early retirement package, but I'm the last of a generation. But where are we today? Many are getting laid off now with very little compensation and being replaced by contract workers.</p> <p>\"The remaining permanent staff don't have the same severance terms and their wages are relatively much lower. To keep competitive in a global economy, we all understand that means more pressure and less pay, but there's a feeling that companies are now exploiting the labour market and it's getting way out of hand. There's no question we need a minimum wage.\"</p> <h2> External forces</h2> <p>In the retail industry, most of the major stores pay their permanent staff fair rates, but many are now outsourcing services such as shelf-filling, warehousing and cashier work with some of the major chains relying on external suppliers for up to 40% of their workforce.</p> <p>According to the DGB, permanent staff at Aldi, with two years job experience, earn about \u20ac2,200 a month (\u00a31,778). That's \u20ac1,400 (\u00a31,131) net after paying health insurance, pension contributions and unemployment protection \u2013 the tax rate can vary considerably depending on family status. Holiday is normally 30 days and redundancy terms fair.</p> <p>But those working for suppliers and performing the same tasks are employed as temporary workers and earn about \u20ac6.50 per hour (\u00a35.25), often on a mini-job basis. They are not entitled to employee pension or sickness contributions, have no holiday pay and can be fired and re-hired by the same employer up to four times in three years. Julia H, a single-mother with two children who works about 30 hours a week, relies on income support for food. \"Germany desperately needs a minimum wage. It's vital for the economy and society.\"</p> <p>In Britain, Aldi pays \u00a36.90 an hour (\u00a37.90 in the London area) with four weeks holiday. That's around \u00a31,196 a month gross for a 40 hour week \u2013 significantly lower than permanent staff in Germany but above typical rates for temporary workers. Tesco pays around \u00a36.40 an hour in most of the UK, but \u00a38.15 in London.</p>",
  "<p>Designing a garden for people who are unable to walk, move or, in some cases, breathe unaided takes some thinking about. Patients at the <a href=\"http://www.spinalinjurycentre.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Duke of Cornwall Spinal Treatment Centre</a> in Salisbury used to face months confined indoors during their recovery, undergoing physiotherapy and repetitive exercises. But a&#xa0;newly-opened garden carved from a blank patch of grass by garden designer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/may/22/chelsea-flower-show-cleve-west-winner\" title=\"\">Cleve West</a> provides an outdoor space for patients that transcends their physical impairment and provides a respite for family and friends.</p> <p>The garden was the brainchild of teenager Horatio Chapple, who volunteered at the centre. His research showed patients asking for a beautiful escape, away from the clinical environment, to spend time with family and friends. Horatio never saw his vision materialise: he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/06/polar-bear-survivors-norway-hospital\" title=\"\">killed by a polar bear</a> in 2011, aged 17, while on an adventure holiday on a remote island in the Arctic Circle. The garden, which cost \u00a3300,000, was created in Horatio's memory through charitable donations and fundraising by his parents and friends.</p> <p>There are curved borders filled with textured, cheerful planting. Seats are surrounded by a froth of <a href=\"http://search.thompson-morgan.com/seeds/Erigeron%20Daisies\" title=\"\">erigeron daisies</a>, scented herbs and stands of <a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1993\" title=\"\"><em>Verbena bonariensis</em></a>, full of butterflies. Multi-stem birch trees form tall, fluid pillars. A water feature runs the length of a metal arch that will one day soon be covered in trained apple trees and trailing wisteria. \"It is about creating a&#xa0;positive mental space,\" West says. \"The view is brought into the garden and the repetition of the lines echoes the landscape beyond. The apples have significance, too, as they were a favourite of Horatio's.\"</p> <p>Central to the design are three representations of spines. At the far side is a long, flowing stone wall in the shape of a healthy spine; its sweeping curves are topped with smooth stones, so it doubles as a&#xa0;seat. To reach it, one crosses the garden via a path that cuts through two other undulating but incomplete \"spines\". Their construction is similar to the healthy one, but uncapped and surrounded by foliage, they are rougher. In a&#xa0;situation where patients and their families have to come to terms with what has happened, the journey to healing is a powerful metaphor.</p> <p>West, who has won best in show at the Chelsea Flower Show for two years running, went to great lengths to understand how patients would experience the garden, by being wheeled around the space in a&#xa0;wheelchair and flat on his back on a hospital bed. The wide, smooth paths made of resin-bonded gravel provide a bump-free passage for patients. David Joliffe arrived at the unit after a paragliding accident. \"I&#xa0;went outside for the garden opening \u2013 it was the first time in 14&#xa0;weeks. It was wonderful, feeling the wind on my face, despite being&#xa0;still&#xa0;in bed,\" he says.</p> <p>Intended as an antidote to institution, the design is anything but utilitarian; while there are areas that can be used for therapy, the smooth curves and soft planting would grace any garden. It caters for&#xa0;all tastes, with raised beds and a&#xa0;potting area that would not look out of place in an urban garden, while rough walls and relaxed planting invoke something closer to&#xa0;a country wilderness.</p> <p>Mike Payne, a 32-year-old electronic engineer, arrives in the greenhouse under his own steam. On a night out last summer, he fell from a bridge, breaking every rib, puncturing a lung and damaging his&#xa0;back so badly that he will never&#xa0;walk again. But he seems extraordinarily cheerful. \"I came out&#xa0;last night and it is just so quiet,\" he says. \"I'm looking forward to reading my book here \u2013 before, I&#xa0;would sit in the doorway nearest the car park. But when you have been stuck inside on bed rest for six&#xa0;weeks and can't even look out of&#xa0;the&#xa0;window, and then you can go&#xa0;anywhere outside\u2026 it was the best thing ever!\"</p> <p>The garden offers sensory stimulation and invites interaction \u2013 downy leaves of lambs' ears (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/885.shtml\" title=\"\"><em>Stachys byzantina</em></a>) and feathery fennel beg to be touched; dense, solid blocks of box anchor the waving grasses in a&#xa0;pleasing contrast of form and colour. Scented herbs, veg and alpine strawberries in raised beds demand to be tasted. There is the sound of moving water, wind in the trees and insects feasting on the nectar-rich planting.</p> <p>Ian Nixon has been at the hospital for four months. \"Mental stimulation makes a world of difference,\" he says. \"I have only been out twice, and this place will make a big difference because it's so&#xa0;accessible. I just like being outdoors. It is a freedom that you take for granted when you are able-bodied, but in hospital all you can do is look out of the window.\"</p> <p>SENSORY PLANTS</p> <p><strong>Touch </strong>Common fennel (<a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=801\" title=\"\"><em>Foeniculum vulgare</em></a>); lambs' ears (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/885.shtml\" title=\"\"><em>Stachys byzantina</em></a>); giant feather grass (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/889.shtml\" title=\"\"><em>Stipa gigantea</em></a>); <a href=\"http://www.gardensillustrated.com/article/plants/nurserymans-favourites-%E2%80%93-august\" title=\"\"><em>Sedum spectabile</em> 'Jos\u00e9 Aubergine'</a>; stars of Persia (<a href=\"http://www.finegardening.com/plantguide/allium-christophii-albopilosum-stars-of-persia.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Allium christophii</em></a>).</p> <p><strong>Sight</strong> <a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=736\" title=\"\"><em>Eryngium giganteum</em> 'Silver Ghost'</a>; buckler fern (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/12817.shtml\" title=\"\"><em>Dryopteris erythrosora</em></a>); box (<a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/advicesearch/profile.aspx?pid=88\" title=\"\">buxus</a>); coneflower (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/11444.shtml\" title=\"\"><em>Rudbeckia occidentalis</em> 'Green Wizard'</a>); black birch (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plant_finder/plant_pages/11363.shtml\" title=\"\"><em>Betula nigra</em></a>); ornamental onion (<a href=\"http://www.shootgardening.co.uk/plant/allium-schubertii\" title=\"\"><em>Allium schubertii</em></a>).</p> <p><strong>Scent</strong> Thyme (<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dnnya/7272759938/\" title=\"\"><em>Thymus vulgaris </em>'Compactus'</a>); sweet box (<a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1784\" title=\"\"><em>Sarcococca confusa</em></a><em>)</em>; oregano (<a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1352\" title=\"\"><em>Origanum laevigatum</em> 'Herrenhausen'</a>); rosemary (<a href=\"http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Rosmarinus-officinalis.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Rosmarinus officinalis</em></a>).</p> <p><strong>Taste</strong> Alpine strawberry (<a href=\"http://www.gardenersworld.com/blogs/grow-and-eat/alpine-strawberries/2974.html\" title=\"\"><em>Fragaria vesca</em></a>); apples <a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=5782\" title=\"\">'Rosemary Russet'</a> and <a href=\"http://www.orangepippin.com/apples/laxtons-superb\" title=\"\">'Laxton's Superb'</a>; vegetables including pak choi and 'Lollo Rosso'&#xa0;lettuce.</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> For more information, visit the <a href=\"http://ssit.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Southern Spinal Injuries Trust</a>.</p>",

Lunch was a tasting of new dishes: new terrine, autumn tart and sambonade \u2013 a goat's cheese cheesecake with elderflower and a&#xa0;secret centre.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Stayed and had dinner with a&#xa0;couple of friends \u2013 obviously had a&#xa0;meat fruit. We're serving around 1,000 of them a week now!</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>None at home because I&#xa0;was running late, but I had tea and breakfast canap\u00e9s at the launch of a&#xa0;new <a href=\"http://www.visionexpress.com/news/0042//\" title=\"\">Vision Express</a> shop on Oxford Street \u2013 loads of bites, so breakfast in stages.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Vision Express sushi before cutting the ribbon for the official store opening. I met another great spectacle-wearing geek, <a href=\"http://gadgetshow.channel5.com/profiles/Jason_Bradbury\" title=\"\">Jason Bradbury</a>, there from The Gadget Show, so had a lot to talk about.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Roast chicken at a friend's \u2013 it's the biggest joy when someone asks you to their home and cooks for you, but my mates always joke that it's such a stress. I think it's the other way round when they come to mine \u2013 it's not as if I can just cook up a steak. People are expecting to eat the cutlery at the very least.</p> <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>A quick tea and pastry on the way&#xa0;to the lab \u2013 more Earl Grey.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Tasting two new dishes for the Duck. Nowhere near finished, but one will end up on the menu for Christmas as a kind of \"partridge in a pear tree\" \u2013 partridge cooked in butter at a low temperature to relax the meat, served on the breastbone with brandy butter, and chestnut and pine and mandarin (basically all the aromas and flavours we associate with Christmas). We're also looking at the leathering process from the 1800s for a turbot dish \u2013 tanning agents in early 1800s Britain were sumac, oak and mimosa bark, so we use all three. The drainage from the tanneries heated up the land, and we grew pineapples and melons on it, so we serve the fish with savoury melon and purple carrot. Oh, and frankincense and crystalised sea veg \u2013 we make our own leather from the fish skin, which you don't eat, but which will be part of the cutlery for the texture and smell. Easy, really, to balance all that?!</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Working late in Bray after tasting, so had a beer and some of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/28/staff-meals-worlds-best-restaurants\" title=\"\">head chef Jonny Lake's</a> nachos with the boys after service.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Heston's Fantastical Food starts on 6 November at 9pm on Channel 4.</p> <p></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/nigellalawson\" title=\"\"><strong>Nigella Lawson</strong></a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398955393\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351246121301/Nigella-Lawson-009.jpg\" alt=\"Nigella Lawson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigella Lawson.

Straight after breakfast, made batch of coffee ice-cream and chocolate nougat cookies to take to curry favour with various radio and TV interviews that I have lined up for day.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>I am not good when I miss meals; being hungry makes me both murderous and suicidal. So didn't feel good that I didn't manage to get back for lunch until about 4.30pm and had to leave house for the next thingy at 5pm, so all I had time for was some rye toast with hummus and coriander on top, and a far too small portion at that.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>Roast chicken \u2013 I have all the bits with cartilage and skin, by choice, while pretending to make great sacrifices so that the children can eat the white meat \u2013 on escarole (my favourite lettuce) dressed just with Maldon, <a href=\"http://www.farrington-oils.co.uk/products/mellow-yellow/\" title=\"\">Mellow Yellow cold-pressed rapeseed oil</a>, lemon and lots of English mustard.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Made an egg and bacon sandwich for one of the children, but then ran too late to have breakfast myself. Not a good start to the day, made worse by the fact that I was going to a photographic shoot, which always makes me nervy.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Made up for lack of breakfast by eating huge amounts of rotisserie chicken, char-grilled corn and crinkly chips from <a href=\"http://www.chickenshop.com/\" title=\"\">Chicken Shop</a> in Kentish Town. Don't blame them for the poor display: I had a takeaway and didn't present the food (such was my quaking hunger) to its best advantage. From this point onwards, my life started looking up.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>By special request, made risi e bisi, a Venetian recipe (think a soupy pea risotto) that's a favourite in my home. I am always grateful when this is what I'm asked to cook, because it's quick and easy, and as comforting for the cook as the eater.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398955394\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351101106395/Food-diaries-Nigella-008.jpg\" alt=\"Food diaries Nigella\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigella Lawson: 'I am not good when I miss meals; being hungry makes me both murderous and\u00a0suicidal.'

I feel a real traitor to&#xa0;my country choosing Vegemite over Marmite, but there it is.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Since this is a day of interviews, and the meagre toast with Vegemite is wearing off to the point of panic, I order a steak and chips. True, there are only four chips on the plate (though I must tell you they were much bigger and hunkier than they look), but they've been generous with the b\u00e9arnaise sauce, and I also have a tube of <a href=\"http://www.colmans.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Colman's</a> in&#xa0;my bag, so I manage to get through the afternoon.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>By request, again, I make another of my children's favourites \u2013 penne with ham, peas and cream.</p> <p><strong>Thursday </strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast</strong> The usual rye toast and egg \u2013 and an awful lot of tea. In fact, I can never actually eat breakfast before I've had my two mugs of tea.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Have a meeting at home over lunch, so roast a butterflied leg of lamb, along with a tin of sliced pink fir apple potatoes, yellow courgettes, cherry tomatoes, leeks and black olives. There is no particular design to this vegetable mixture: I was just giving my fridge a bit of a going through, and bunged everything that needed to be used up into a roasting tin.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>Although I complied with children's wishes, making them burgers (not homemade, I must own up, but <a href=\"http://www.waitrose.com/shop/ProductView-10317-10001-134075-Heston+from+Waitrose+2+Ultimate+Beef+Burgers\" title=\"\">Heston's from Waitrose</a>) with plastic cheese, potatoes cut somewhere between wedges and chips, roasted with garlic cloves and pancetta cubes, and a rather 1970s-looking salad, I needed the simple salve of an avocado, eaten with nothing more than a spritz of lemon and a snowy throw of salt.</p> <p>I did succumb to some <a href=\"http://www.boojabooja.com/chocolate_truffles.asp\" title=\"\">Booja-Booja champagne truffles</a> later, but I never feel bad about that.</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Smoked salmon, coarsely ground white pepper, lemon juice and lots of dill \u2013 for me, the best way to eat it. I am very fussy about the smoked salmon, though; it must be London-cure, which is so lusciously mild that it's more like eating wafer-thin sashimi than anything else. I&#xa0;get mine, as my grandmother did before me, from <a href=\"http://www.panzers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Panzer's in St John's Wood</a>, despite the schlepp.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>A frantic day, and much as I&#xa0;like having proper meals and not grabbed snacks, lunch today is a&#xa0;toasted sandwich. Still, it's a very good toastie, buttery-crisp on the outside, lined with ham as thin and tender and pink as a kitten's tongue, and gooey with jarlsberg.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>Going to see Michael McIntyre at the O2, so supper has to be a picnic on the way there. I&#xa0;have an old picnic box I bought on eBay, and make a few batches of rice noodle and prawn salad, with beansprouts, sugar snaps and a lot of ginger, chilli and soy to go inside it. Friends we're going with a supply of champagne and, given that I can get drunk on one glass, I am reeling by the time I get home. Fantastic night, though, topped off by a buttered, toasted bagel on my return, followed by crisps and chocolate.</p> <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Get up too late for breakfast, but manage a good lunch-after-the-night-before (and pre-opening snoop) at <a href=\"http://www.colbertchelsea.com/\" title=\"\">Colbert</a> of fried eggs with black pudding and cr\u00eapes with lemon and sugar.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>I live very near <a href=\"http://www.thechelseafishmonger.com/\" title=\"\">the Chelsea Fishmonger</a> and generally throw myself at Rex, the fishmonger, and get myself comfortingly overstocked for the weekend. Tonight's supper is part of this catch: halibut, juicily roasted and plonked on top of some treviso leaves, with broccoli cooked with garlic oil, anchovies, chilli and dry white vermouth. This is what I use whenever I want white wine taste, but without having to open a bottle. I know it sounds odd, but unless we're having friends over, it never occurs to me to open a&#xa0;bottle of wine.</p> <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Up too late for breakfast, but I do manage a supersized cappuccino in bed with the papers.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Tuna tartare with capers, lemon zest, spring onions and rocket: this takes about three minutes to make and is a virtuous reward for the lazy and greedy.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>Ever since the children have been teenagers, the ritual of Sunday lunch has been shunted on to Sunday supper. Tonight, we're having pork belly slices \u2013 think melting meat and triumphant, bronze crackling \u2013 with soy and cumin gravy, mashed potato and broccoli. I've been experimenting with some mini versions of my cappuccino pavlova and have some bases left, as well as some coffee ice-cream from Monday, so do a housekeeping job of getting rid of the two together (that's my excuse), anointed with a sticky, gleaming drizzle of Golden Syrup which, along with Maldon and Colman's, constitute the holy trinity of&#xa0;Great British Foodstuffs.</p> <p>\u2022 Nigella Lawson's new book, Nigellissima: Instant Italian Inspiration, is published by Chatto &amp; Windus at \u00a326.

When not working, I'll cheerfully eat the same things over and over. I was on holiday for much of the week, so I'm amazed there's no Indian or a Thai: I&#xa0;usually pine for them after monoculturalist Italy. No&#xa0;apologies for the datterini surfeit \u2013 I'd happily live on them. And toast.</p> <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Tomatoes with chilli: I&#xa0;can't get enough of the local datterini tomatoes of joy.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Risotto at <a href=\"http://www.trattoriadacarmelo.com/\" title=\"\">Trattoria Carmello</a> \u2013 I&#xa0;practically live in this restaurant in Marina di Ragusa whenever I'm in Sicily. Simple but wonderful.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Satro in Scicli \u2013 new and still finding its feet. Toast, anchovy, sliver of lemon \u2013 tangy! Maccheroni with swordfish. The inevitable almondy, custardy cakes to finish.</p> <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>More datterini.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Tuna and green peppers \u2013 usually hate green peppers, but these almost melted down into the tuna.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Lobster paella \u2013 bizarre to be&#xa0;eating paella in Sicily, but that's what our hosts cooked for us.</p> <p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Berocca and banana (and one or two datterini) \u2013 healthy!</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>A horrid little salad with tinned corn in a Modica cafe \u2013 you can get bad food in Italy.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Anchovy toasts. Bread with red tuna and its roe.

I meant not to eat because I knew what was coming later\u2026</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong><a href=\"http://www.bubbledogs.co.uk/amp\" title=\"\">Kitchen Table</a> on Charlotte Street, for a review \u2013 though you'll have to wait until 10 November to read it. <em>Fourteen</em> courses. Several highlights, chief among them a giddily brilliant liquoricey pear cake.</p> <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Tea and a Crunchie \u2013 not proud of this: I'm calling it elevenses.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong><a href=\"http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/restaurants/garufin-info-278713.html\" title=\"\">Garufin</a> in Holborn. Pulled pork, chorizo, beans, squash \u2013 earthy and wonderful. Quail cooked in an escabeche \u2013 the presentation made me hoot.

Lunch is a big variable \u2013 weekdays, if I'm writing, I'll just grab a bowl of soup or knock up a salad, but more often than not I'll be recipe testing or out tasting for the businesses I&#xa0;consult for, so don't want a proper lunch. Suppers, too, have no real pattern \u2013 I'm generally out no more than twice a week, and at home it's usually based around what's about to go off in the fridge.</p> <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Bacon and pineapple butties \u2013 must be a Saturday!</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Friends over. Stunning bit of plaice, and probably the last time I&#xa0;do peas and lettuce this year \u2013 definitely a sunshine dish. And an emergency pud \u2013 vanilla sponge stolen from a friend with a quick plum compote and pistachios.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>My sister and her kids came round for supper, so we had the first big beefy braise of the winter.</p> <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Some days I have eggs, others muesli.

Ended up making canap\u00e9s a bit pissed: hummus and mung beans, potatoes and pesto... Basically any leftovers I had in the fridge.</p> <p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Had the plaice bones from Saturday in the fridge, so put on a&#xa0;fish stock while eating my muesli.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>A cheese straw Parthenon set the tone on the first day of cooking for the new book. Didn't have a&#xa0;sit-down lunch because of that: shared a PPP \u2013 potato pesto pizza \u2013 with the girls for lunch, then more baking with raspberry jam tarts. Had a&#xa0;proper madeleine moment when I ate one later \u2013 hadn't had a&#xa0;jam tart for years and I&#xa0;came over a bit emotional.

  "<p>One of the functions of fiction is to serve as a kind of tourism, either showing us places, situations and people that we might not otherwise reach or scrolling through snapshots of events or sensations that we remember. Crime stories rarely serve the latter purpose \u2013 most admirers of homicide novels will, thankfully, never become or even know a murder victim \u2013 but are a perfect illustration of the former.</p> <p>Throughout its history, crime literature has operated as a sort of imaginative travel agency, taking customers across borders and introducing them to unknown cultures. The story commonly considered the birth of the whodunit \u2013 <a href=\"http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/eapoe/bl-eapoe-murders.htm\" title=\"\">Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841)</a> \u2013 was written by an American and set in Paris. Since then, the genre has regularly been a ticket for a Grand Tour.</p> <p>Agatha Christie, an enthusiastic globe-trotter through her wealth and marriage to an archaeologist, sent <a href=\"http://www.poirot.us/poirot.php\" title=\"\">Hercule Poirot </a>on the Orient Express, Nile cruises and aeroplane journeys, depicting trips that the majority of her audience was unlikely ever to experience for real. Later in the 20th century, readers, listeners and viewers of detective tales learned about France from <a href=\"http://www.trussel.com/f_maig.htm\" title=\"\">Simenon's Maigret </a>and the Netherlands through <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/jul/22/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Nicolas Freeling's Commissaris Van der Valk</a>, who achieved the rare double of topping both the TV ratings lists (in the ITV series starring Barry Foster) and the pop charts, with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_ZSaxF63Gs\" title=\"\">Simon Park Orchestra's recording of the theme tune, \"Eye Level\"</a>.</p> <p>And, these days, Britons have a greater understanding of Scandinavian culture than ever before: not from exports such as Abba, Bjorn Borg, Volvo or Ikea, but through what was \u2013 at least until the recent apothesois of sado-masochistic soft porn \u2013 the biggest publishing phenomenon of the 21st century: the super-selling mystery stories of writers from Sweden (Stieg Larsson, Henning Mankell) and Norway (Jo Nesb\u00f8).</p> <p>Retracing these journeys, I have made a 15-part series for BBC Radio 4, <em>Foreign Bodies</em>, which uses celebrated fictional detectives \u2013 from Christie's Poirot to <a href=\"http://www.jonesbo.co.uk/meetharryhole.asp\" title=\"\">Nesb\u00f8's Harry Hole</a> \u2013 to explore the history of modern Europe. Cop novels are a useful tool for such a survey because the police procedural turns on detail. Novelists working in crime-free narratives have no need (and often no wish) to specify a character's job, clothes, income or family background. But because observation and evidence are crucial to the investigation of a crime \u2013 the motive for which will often rest on who someone was or what they possessed or desired \u2013 crime writers routinely provide a mass of social detail: menus, train timetables, fashion labels, shops, newspaper stories. As a result, good crime novels become a case-file of their times. The introduction of the welfare system and unemployment benefit, for example, can be traced through the comments of posh employers in Christie's mysteries. And reporters preparing to cover the impending referendum on Scottish independence would be well advised to read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/jun/06/rebus-back-reveals-ian-rankin\" title=\"\">Ian Rankin's DCI Rebus</a> books, which systematically depict the country's re-examination of its identity over the last 25 years, with one book \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/crime/9780752883632/set-in-darkness\" title=\"\"><em>Set in Darkness </em>(2000)</a> \u2013 even involving the discovery of a corpse in the foundations of the Scottish parliament building.</p> <p>In the same way, future historians considering why Sweden holds the improbable distinction of being the only western democracy to have both its prime minister and foreign minister assassinated in modern times \u2013 or why a racist gunman killed 77 people in Norway in 2011 \u2013 will find clues to the forces behind those events in crime novels written at least a decade earlier.</p> <p>Crime fiction is a magnifying glass that frequently reveals the fingerprints of history before they become visible to politicans or journalists. And \u2013 as in a forensic investigation \u2013 separate pieces of evidence can begin to reveal patterns.</p> <p>On <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/crimewatch/\" title=\"\"><em>Crimewatch UK</em></a>, during the update section just after the news in which the detectives discuss calls that have come in from the public, lead investigators will often comment, with a note of satisfaction, that \"certain names have come up several times already\". Weight of recognition, cross-referencing of mentions, is frequently a crucial clue in detection. And, in a more benevolent sense, it was striking how, while following the trail of crime novels written from before the second world war to the present day, the same names \u2013 of influential authors and characters \u2013 kept cropping up.</p> <p>As keen readers in the field might guess, the undisputed godfathers of the genre remain Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) and Sherlock Holmes, who lived in print from 1887 to 1923, although he carries on immortally in all entertainment forms. So long and so strong is the shadow of Holmes that anyone subsequently creating a detective in any culture has had to make a deliberate gesture of homage or avoidance to the resident of 221B Baker Street.</p> <p>For example, it is my strong suspicion that the reason Hercule Poirot (print-dates 1920-75) is Belgian is that, if Christie (1890-1976) had made him English, the detective's characteristics \u2013 intuitive, aloof, fastidious about couture and cuisine \u2013 would have made him too transparently a Holmes clone. The most dramatised detective after Holmes and Poirot, Commissaire Jules Maigret (1931-72), is again distanced from the template by his Parisian location, but he too has certain Holmesian aspects (hyper-intelligence, a pipe) that feel like deliberate nods from his creator, the officially Belgian but temperamentally French Georges Simenon (1903-89).</p> <p>With remarkable consistency across generations and nations, Holmes is the genre's homepage. The tendency of fictional detectives to be more cerebral and sensitive than their real-life counterparts \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/nov/04/pd-james-life-in-writing\" title=\"\">PD James'</a>s Adam Dalgliesh writes poetry, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15239392\" title=\"\">Ruth Rendell's Reg Wexford</a> was a probably rare Guardian-reading liberal in the 1960s force \u2013 follows Conan Doyle's model of the reflective detective, as does the latest top British cop:<a href=\"http://www.peterjames.com/books\" title=\"\"> Peter James's thoughtful, haunted DCI Roy Grace</a>.</p> <p>The Czechoslovakian writer Josef \u0160kvoreck\u00fd (1924-2012) created, in Inspector Boruvka of the Prague Homicide Bureau, a policeman profoundly indebted to Holmes in both hyper-intelligent rationalisation of crimes and near-clinical melancholy. And the newest super-sleuth in publishing \u2013 Nesb\u00f8's Norwegian private eye, Harry Hole \u2013 also allusively combines addiction with an almost supernatural ability to see into the minds of criminals.</p> <p>So pervasive is the post-Holmes type that only significant distinctions of background or gender can avoid the influence. Rankin's impulsive, earthy, working-class Scottish DCI Rebus seems deliberately to depart from the looming English examples. And <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/interview--dci-jane-tennison-yes-that-was-me-prime-suspect-was-far-more-than-mere-tv-for-jackie-malton-on-whose-rebellious-career-helen-mirrens-detective-was-based-1491767.html\" title=\"\">Lynda La Plante's DCI Jane Tennison</a>, who solved seven murder cases on television between 1991 and 2006, was almost as revolutionary as Sherlock in offering an alternative female model, which has been continued and extended in print by writers including Val McDermid and Denise Mina. However, because Conan Doyle is to some extent an invisible author \u2013 most of the Holmes stories employ the voice of Dr Watson and take the form of his report on the case \u2013 he is not the author with most influence on prose tone and structure. In that respect, my inquiries revealed, the biggest influence in European crime fiction is Simenon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398921185\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/10/25/1351182813735/Inspector-Montalbano-008.jpg\" alt=\"Inspector Montalbano\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Camilleri's Inspector Montalbano (played by Luca Zingaretti in the TV series) questions what it means to be a good policeman.

In Berlin, one of the leading German crime-writers, Jakob Arjouni, also kept a complete Simenon close to his desk. PD James cites Simenon as a master as well, confirming a literary afterlife that perhaps validates the view of Andr\u00e9 Gide that the Belgian writer should have won the Nobel prize for literature.</p> <p>This strong sense of tradition and succession in crime fiction was underlined by the almost universal tendency of leading crime novelists to acknowledge predecessors as inspirations. For example, Mankell admitted that his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jul/23/wallander-cant-get-enough\" title=\"\">Kurt Wallander</a> \u2013 a melancholy Swedish policeman whose cases expose changes in Scandinavian society \u2013 could never have existed without the example of Martin Beck, a depressive, historically sensitive cop who featured in the novels of a married couple of former journalists, Maj Sj\u00f6wall and Per Wahl\u00f6\u00f6, whose 10 Beck books published between 1965 and 1975 are being dramatised by Radio 4 as part of this exploration of European crime fiction. Nesb\u00f8 argues that Beck is the source of the now dominant wave of Scandinavian crime stories: a Nordic Holmes.</p> <p>In describing the main remit of my inquiry as postwar crime fiction, I meant the second world war. And the conflict of 1939-45 has an understandably large presence in books written from the differing perspectives of Britain, France, Holland, Germany and Italy. More surprising, though, was the dawning realisation that even books set beyond the reach of that period seemed to have a significant relation with some other military standoff, as if postwar wounds were a natural driving force of the murder novel.</p> <p>The Vietnam war stalks the Martin Beck sequence: his creators met at a protest march against US involvement in south-east Asia. There are long echoes of that radicalising issue in Nesb\u00f8's novels as well. Meanwhile, through his books about the best man in the Prague Homicide Bureau, \u0160kvoreck\u00fd animates two key eastern European experiences of the cold war: occupation and exile. <em>The Mournful Demeanour of Lieutenant Boruvka</em>, written in 1966 in Prague under censorship from the Russian-backed puppet government, can only express dissidence through code and nudges. But, after the author gained asylum in Canada following the Soviet invasion of 1968, <em>The End of Lieutenant Boruvka</em> (1975) and <em>The Return of Lieutenant Boruvka</em> (1980) provide a compelling account of the moral horror and bureaucratic comedy of life under communism.</p> <p>In a similar way, <a href=\"http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/jakob-arjouni/\" title=\"\">Arjouni's</a> character of Kemal Kayankaya \u2013 a private eye born in Germany to a Turkish immigrant family \u2013 explores the consequences for Europe of the collapse of the Soviet empire, the wars in the former Yugoslavia and the reunification of Germany. From <em>Happy Birthday, Turk!</em> (1980) to <em>Brother Kemal</em> (to be published in English in 2013), in which Kayankaya is hired to protect a writer who has offended Islamist groups, Arjouni uses crimes to explore issues \u2013 of immigration, nationalism and religious sensitivity \u2013 that dominate contemporary European politics.</p> <p>In the work of Spain's foremost author in the form \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/oct/21/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries1\" title=\"\">Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n</a> (1939-2003) \u2013 the conflict that underlies the writing is the Spanish civil war, or, at least, the dictatorship of General Franco that followed and the subsequent transition to a constitutional monarchy, with King Juan Carlos I as a rare example of a monarch as a post-revolutionary figure. Montalb\u00e1n (after whom Camilleri's Inspector Montalbano is named in homage) employs his Barcelona private eye, Pepe Carvalho, to interrogate this complex political situation. Montalb\u00e1n's work is an exemplar of how crime novels can be used to analyse shifts in society: <em>An Olympic Death</em>, published just after the 1992 Barcelona games, makes fascinating reading in a London also struggling with the cost and legacy of hosting the event.</p> <p>Inevitably, though, it is scar tissue from the great global battles of the 20th century that runs through European crime fiction. Both Maigret and Poirot are war veterans: David Suchet laments that the limp from the Belgian's wound is the only characteristic he has failed to incorporate in his ITV portrayal. In the Van der Valk stories, on both page and screen, it was common for the solution to lie in whether victims or suspects had been collaborators or resistance fighters during the Nazi occupation of Holland.</p> <p>And, even though Nesb\u00f8 was not born until 1960, his books fascinatingly illuminate a specifically Scandinavian experience of the second world war. This is partly because of the writer's own personal legacy \u2013 his mother was in the resistance, while his father was among the Norwegians who fought with the Germans \u2013 but also because Norway has a literal inheritance from the period. As Scandinavians embodied the physical ideal of Nazi eugenicists, citizens were enlisted, during the occupation, in a breeding programme involving German officers, whose descendants remain in the population today. This dark history is threaded through the Harry Hole novels, particularly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/crime/9780099546764/the-devils-star\" title=\"\"><em>The Devil's Star</em></a> (2005). In retrospect, we can see that the books also chart the rise of modern Norwegian neo-Nazism, a psychopathic disciple of which, Anders Behring Breivik, murdered 77 people in Oslo and on Ut\u00f8ya island last year. While journalism explored these tensions after the event, Scandinavian crime fiction \u2013 as the genre often does \u2013 sensed the undercurrents before the massacre happened.</p> <p>Admittedly, there is one large and frustrating gap in the form's record of the causes and consequences of the second world war. Bernhard Schlink, who wrote a number of detective novels in the 1980s before becoming better known for literary fiction such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780297859321/the-reader\" title=\"\"><em>The Reader</em></a>, acknowledges that for decades German authors were reluctant to engage with their nation's past. My suspicion is that mystery stories were a particular victim of this self-censorship because the classic structure of the murder puzzle \u2013 in which the guilt of the past is exposed and secrets are revealed - was always likely to lead, in Germany, to the villains of the Hitler era. The continuing sensitivity of the subject was shown this year when Ferdinand von Schirach \u2013 whose grandfather was head of the Hitler Youth \u2013 achieved a bestseller but also triggered controversy with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/21/thrillers-roundup-reviews\" title=\"\"><em>The Collini Case</em></a>, a legal thriller that deals with the continuing taboo of the infiltration of the postwar German political and judicial systems by former Nazis.</p> <p>Because of the belated and apprehensive literary response to the war in the defeated aggressor, the greatest German-language crime stories of the 20th century were written by a non-German. <a href=\"http://www.portwashington.com/moveweb/Guidewrite/durrenmatt.html\" title=\"\">Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt</a> (1921-90) was a Swiss polymath who worked as a playwright (<em>The Visit</em>, <em>The Physicists</em>), artist and essayist, but also wrote brilliant cop novels that explore the postwar guilt of Germany and Switzerland, whose official stance of political neutrality D\u00fcrrenmatt regarded as a lie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398921186\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/10/25/1351183056513/The-Pledge-008.jpg\" alt=\"The Pledge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Nicholson as the compromised cop in <em>The Pledge</em>.

It is in the work of D\u00fcrrenmatt that the crime story most fulfils its potential as an instrument for moral exploration. In <em>The Pledge</em> (1958), provocatively subtitled \"Requiem for the Detective Novel\", a retired homicide detective shockingly uses a young girl as bait in the hope of catching a sex-killer who has eluded him. In an Americanised but still properly disturbing version, <em>The Pledge</em> was impresssively filmed by Sean Penn in 2001, with Jack Nicholson as the compromised cop.</p> <p>During months of interviews, one comment affected my thinking about the genre more than any other. The Spanish writer <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-summer-of-dead-toys-by-antonio-hill-7858672.html\" title=\"\">Antonio Hill </a>\u2013 who has just started a Barcelona-based series with <em>The Summer of Dead Toys</em> \u2013 told me that, on a recent trip to Mexico, his hosts had expressed astonishment at his profession. \"Why the hell,\" they asked, \"would you want to write books about policemen?\" Mexicans could not envisage a cop as a hero.</p> <p>The implication of this anecdote \u2013 that crime fiction depends on readers' respect for the investigator \u2013 poses a challenge to mainstream British crime fiction, in which there is an overwhelming assumption that justice will ultimately be done. With very rare exceptions \u2013 in one of PD James's novels, Dalgliesh is forced to accept that the real villain has evaded blame \u2013 the crime is correctly and satisfyingly solved. And yet, from the Birmingham Six to Hillsborough, via recent allegations of police complicity with tabloid journalists and earlier failures to investigate the paedophilia of Jimmy Savile, there are frequent worrying suggestions that the British police have been less reliably straight than their counterparts in fiction.</p> <p>Mexicans sceptical about this kind of literature, though, should note Italian crime fiction, which pointedly accommodates ambiguity about the possibility of resolution and the role of the investigator. Leonardo Sciascia (1921-89), identified as a past master by contemporary authors almost as often as Simenon, openly showed an Italian society in which the power of the Mafia is so great that the judicial system judges it unwise to identify the true culprits. In <em>Equal Danger</em> (1971), Inspector Rogas, a rural 'tec looking into murders in the legal profession, soon realises that his police and political bosses do not want him to uncover the truth. That novel, and <em>The Day of the Owl</em> (1961), were landmark books in making Cosa Nostra a legitimate subject for fiction.</p> <p>Andrea Camilleri \u2013 who, like Sciascia, comes from the Mafia heartland of Sicily \u2013 has continued his predecessor's project of dramatising the overlap between the political and gangster establishments. Inspector Montalbano directly addresses, in anguished inner monologue, the question of what it means to be a good policeman in a culture where it can be unwelcome \u2013 or even dangerous \u2013 to crack a case. The fine British writer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/apr/04/culture.obituaries\" title=\"\">Michael Dibdin </a>(1947-2007), in his 11 books about the Venetian-born Inspector Zen, borrowed from Sciascia a very non-English scepticism about the good faith of police operations.</p> <p>The pressure to ignore the real perpetrator, or to pin the crime on a false suspect, is even greater for characters who serve as police officers in a police state. The Russian writer Boris Akunin addresses this dilemma \u2013 albeit through the distancing device of historical parallel \u2013 in his series about a 19th-century police officer, Erast Fandorin. But it was \u0160kvoreck\u00fd who, from his North American exile, most eloquently expressed the dilemma of the investigator encouraged to turn a blind eye. Inspector Boruvka's problem in Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia, he wrote, was that \"the whole country was a crime scene\" in which mass murders were regularly carried out by the government. From his reading of Conan Doyle and others, \u0160kvoreck\u00fd understood that the classic homicide puzzle depends on violent death being an exceptional event. That is why the English genre \u2013 from Christie to James and Rendell \u2013 has often involved bodies being stumbled on in rural communities, guaranteeing a dissonance between order and disorder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398921187\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/10/25/1351183485871/Shadow-Dancer-008.jpg\" alt=\"Shadow Dancer\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Bradby's <em>Shadow Dancer</em> with (left to right) Domhnall Gleeson, Andrea Riseborough and Brid Brennan.

Only now, after years of ceasefire and peace process, is Northern Irish crime fiction flourishing through such writers as <a href=\"http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article/3473/stuart-neville-from-armagh-to-la\" title=\"\">Stuart Neville</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9440801/Tom-Bradby-how-I-brought-Shadow-Dancer-to-the-screen.html\" title=\"\">Tom Bradby</a>. Jason Webster points out that Spain's equivalent of the IRA, the Basque separatist terrorists ETA, who agreed a ceasefire only very recently, has yet to make a significant appearance in Spanish crime fiction. The cop novel seems to require chaos recollected from relative stability.</p> <p>It's notable, though, that even in settings where a redemptive ending is unlikely, the central investigator is invariably on the side of right. However pressured or frightened Boruvka, Rogas, Montalbano or Zen may be, they at least attempt to do the right thing. Even at its most sophisticated, the genre seems to reflect a belief that order will be restored.</p> <p>Among Sherlock Holmes's many profound influences on the genre is his status as a dire warning to authors of the risks of killing off a sleuth beloved by the public. Conan Doyle's medically unrealistic and narratively ridiculous resurrection of Holmes after killing him at the Reichenbach Falls has become a cautionary tale for crime novelists in much the way that makers of popular television are haunted by two notorious series-weakening links that also, curiously, involved water: Bobby Ewing coming out of the shower alive a year after dying in <em>Dallas</em> (his wife had dreamed his death!) and the Fonz raising his surfboard over a killer fish in <em>Happy Days</em>, leading to \"jumping the shark\" becoming the expression for a show that jettisons credibility.</p> <p>True to his cussed literary sensitivity, Nicolas Freeling believed that he could jump the Reichenbach Falls. In <em>A Long Silence</em> (1972), Van der Valk goes for an evening stroll on a rainy Dutch street and is killed in a hit-and-run related to the case he is working on. A shocking passage even when read in the knowledge of its outcome, it is one of Freeling's best pieces of writing (the critic Grey Gowrie describes Freeling as one of the finest writers of atmospheric weather) but it had a calamitous effect on his career. His readership, like the crazed fan in Stephen King's <em>Misery</em>, rebelled and refused to warm to his replacement franchise: a series featuring a French investigator, Henri Castang. In an emergency manoeuvre, Freeling was persuaded to turn to his dead detective's widow, Arlette, as a central character in a new Van der Valk series, but the audience would not be appeased.</p> <p>Conan Doyle and Freeling have the effect of a siren blaring in the head of any crime writer who, bored with a hero, considers sending them to Switzerland either literally (the Reichenbach Falls) or metaphorically, now that Zurich is code for euthanasia. Although, strangely enough, it is a Swiss detective who dies most decisively and irretrievably: almost the first thing we learn about Inspector Barlach of the Bern Police is that he has terminal cancer, which is why there are only two books about him. Killing a cerebral investigator in a Swiss canton may be another of D\u00fcrrenmatt's dark jokes.</p> <p>In the modern publishing world, with marketing managers craving a new title in a bestselling series every Christmas for as many years as possible, authors have to make a formal decision about the longevity of their cops. PD James told me that she could not bear to kill off Dalgliesh, because it would feel like writing her own death, although she declared the end of the series with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/crime/9780571242443/the-private-patient\" title=\"\"><em>The Private Patient</em></a> (2006). That same year, Rankin retired DCI John Rebus, but has brought him back to investigate a cold case (in line with realistic police procedure) in this autumn's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/crime/9781409144717/standing-in-another-mans-grave\" title=\"\"><em>Standing in Another Man's Grave</em></a>, having admitted to missing him. Mankell gave Wallander Alzheimer's disease in a book published three years ago, which means the detective could theoretically return but not practically, thereby reducing Mankell's risk of suffering the misery of having his ankles broken by a furious enthusiast holding him hostage in a snowy cabin. Camilleri told me that a final Montalbano novel was written out of sequence and locked in a safe at his publishers (as Christie did with the Poirot coda, <em>Curtain</em>). Miming a waterfall with his hands, he joked that he has made it impossible for his detective to be resurrected.</p> <p>At the Crime Writing Festival in Harrogate this year, Jo Nesb\u00f8, currently the world's bestselling crime writer, admitted that he knows exactly how many Harry Hole novels there will be. The front row, containing staff from his publisher, leaned forward nervously, but Nesb\u00f8 refused to disclose the number. A keen crime-reader I know believes that it will be 10: the number of career cases investigated by the godfather of Scandinavian detective fiction, Martin Beck, and the number of books to which Stieg Larsson intended his Millennium sequence to stretch until his early death confined Lisbeth Salander to a trilogy.</p> <p>Another Stockholm phenomenon \u2013 the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel prize for literature \u2013 ignored Gide's suggestion that the honour should go to Simenon. And such is the continuing snobbery against the genre that the Belgian's employment of crime fiction may have been held against him, as it may also have hobbled D\u00fcrrenmatt and \u0160kvoreck\u00fd, equally worthy candidates for the range of their writing. But, though sniffed at by literary history, crime writing, from Christie to Nesb\u00f8, has an enviable record of capturing the history of our times.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Foreign Bodies</em> runs on weekdays until 2 November at 1.45pm on BBC Radio 4. <em>The Martin Beck Killings</em> begins on 27 October at 2.30pm on BBC Radio 4.</p>",

The Sunday Times's <strong>Dominic Sandbrook</strong> adopted a rather less subjective approach, calling the author's chronicle of the last eight years of Nelson's life \"a sequel of colossal length, global sweep and great psychological acuity \u2026 At times his book, almost staggering under the weight of detail, is slow going.

  "<p>Last winter Europe was basking in its best snow season since social networks began. My friends' timelines were abuzz with updates and images chronicling the ridiculous amount of snow falling in the Alps. All of which would have been fine if I wasn't heading to the usually snowsure state of Colorado for 10 days, where it was having its \"worst\" winter for a decade.</p> <p>It hadn't snowed for two weeks and nothing was forecast for the duration of my stay. Landing under a starry sky in Durango \u2013 after a short internal hop from Denver \u2013 my planned powder quest was looking like a non-starter. I resolved to keep Wi-Fi off until my return home. Yet, even though not a flake fell, two mornings later I was carving turns in soft, untracked snow under a blazing sun and blue sky without a soul in sight.</p> <p>The San Juan mountains are a rugged range in the Rockies of south-western Colorado. Its resorts, unlike those that cluster around Denver, boast uncluttered slopes, minimal lift queues and far fewer British visitors. The region is famous for having the highest concentration of fourteeners (14,000ft peaks) in North America. It's popular with skiers and snowboarders seeking fresh snow and many of them are prepared to forgo the ski lifts and hike, ski tour or splitboard to access the finest untouched powder.</p> <p>Along Route 550, the road between Durango and Silverton, local powder-hounds pick the lines they fancy riding as they drive along the interstate, and their parked cars cluster around favourite starting points. The former 19th-century mining hub of Durango, still atmospherically soundtracked by a steam locomotive (now operated just for tourists to Silverton and back), is a friendly, outdoorsy town, which champions local produce, brews its own beer and boasts canyon vistas straight out of a western. In fact, many westerns have been filmed here and the Rochester Hotel (<a href=\"http://rochesterhotel.com/\" title=\"\">rochesterhotel.com</a>) in town pays tribute to them with themed rooms and marquee light-framed posters in the hallways.</p> <p>I spent my first day at nearby Durango Mountain Resort. It's a fun venue with striking views and though it wasn't particularly taxing terrain, it was a good place to get my legs back and my lungs used to the altitude \u2013 the town sits at 1,988m, with the resort summit at 3,299m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398412964\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/10/26/1351254705840/The-former-mining-town-of-001.jpg\" alt=\"The former mining town of Silverton with San Juan Range of the Rockies in the background.\" width=\"460\" height=\"305\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The former mining town of Silverton with San Juan Range of the Rockies in the background. Photograph: Robert Francis/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Francis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To reach the best snow, I hired a guide \u2013 Josh from Kling Mountain Guides \u2013 who took me to a hire shop to pick up a splitboard for me to try, so we could hike to the powder stashes along the highway.</p> <p>\"So where are we off to,\" I asked. Josh pointed to a map of frequent avalanche paths in the region. \"Oh right,\" I said, \"So we'll avoid them?\"</p> <p>\"No,\" he said. \"That's where we'll find the best snow.\"</p> <p>Our target was McMillan Peak, a relatively straightforward climb with a rise of 550m from the car, at 3,352m, to the peak, at 3,902m. I was surprised to go from feeling like a waddling duck to a cross-country skier in a relatively short time as we nestled our fat \"skis\" into some ski touring tracks, which gently took us through a pine forest, past a couple of old mining huts, and then up steeper sections where I experienced the cool Spiderman-stick of my skins.</p> <p>At the summit a 360-degree panorama of snow-capped peaks spread before us, and while I caught my breath and took on some carbs, Josh pointed out gnarly couloirs he skied with friends on his days off. Our own descent was sublime. The snow might have been old but it was deep and dry in a way you rarely experience in Europe, though I struggled a little with the extra weight of the splitboard. By mid-afternoon, following a couple of short hikes, I wanted nothing more than to lie like a starfish in the snow and kip.</p> <p>The next day I let a snowcat do the uphill work for me. San Juan Snowcat Skiing operates off the back of Durango Mountain Resort, and claims to be the largest snowcat operation in Colorado, with a 60-square-mile playground at its disposal.</p> <p>I joined a group of eight to tackle a wind-shaped moonscape called Graysill Mountain. We accessed its 3,505m summit by taking chair one at Durango, followed by a smooth seven-mile drive in a van with snow-tyres and then a two-mile snowcat trip to the top. We managed 10&#xa0;drops throughout the day, with slight tweaks on that original route, sometimes carving through crusty snow, sometimes flying through nose-deep powder, straight-lining between the trees, and looking out for the occasional comedy wipeout. They call such falls a \"yard sale\" over here, which made sense once I'd watched a guy painstakingly retrieve two skis, a pair of goggles and a helmet camera dotted around the landscape slope above him. While you'd definitely have needed some off-piste experience for Durango, especially for the deeper sections, the terrain was rarely intimidatingly steep.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398412965\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/10/26/1351254798891/Snowboarding-on-Silverton-001.jpg\" alt=\"Snowboarding on Silverton Mountain\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snowboarding on Silverton Mountain Photograph: Jon Paciaroni/Getty Images/Flickr</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Paciaroni/Getty Images/Flickr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My next stop, Silverton Mountain, is an hour's drive down the highway; so you need a hire car out here. It's an expert-only resort, where all runs are at least 35 degrees (30 degrees is considered steep in most ski resorts), are un-groomed, and start with a hike from a solitary two-man chair up to 3,700m, which has no safety bar, and swings like a pendulum in the wind, up to 3,700m. In February, the avalanche risk is so high only skiers with a guide are allowed on the mountain. For the rest of the season you can go it alone, but I joined a guided group anyway, hired an avalanche transceiver, probe and shovel, and signed a waiver reminding me: \"You could die here today.\"</p> <p>Silverton Mountain was created by husband-and-wife team, Jen and Aaron Brill, in 2002. The pair actually bought the land and the lift themselves, , inspired by the community-owned club ski fields they'd seen in New Zealand, taking advantage of its perma-sunken price \u2013 the last mine having closed in the region in 1991 \u2013 and the fact that no one was able to build on it as it was on an avalanche path.</p> <p>It normally snows 10 metres a year in Silverton, and yet it rarely attracts more than 80 skiers or snowboarders a day, so the chances of untracked powder are high. The lack of nearby airports or feasible sites to build one means this is unlikely to change. The resort is only open Thursday to Sunday and from the bravado-heavy chat that takes place in the beer tent/ticket office it's clearly trading well on its \"extreme\" tag. Professional snowboarder <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_White\" title=\"\">Shaun White</a> had his own secret halfpipe built nearby to train for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, lending more kudos to the area.</p> <p>Though I would have rather have tackled its bowls and chutes with fresher snow and fresher legs, Silverton still had some great snow stashes and is without doubt one of the most hardcore places I've ever snowboarded. After a fantastic day, we drove back from the lift station to the one-horse town of Silverton, and the Teller House Hotel, which was built in 1896, and still oozes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age\" title=\"\">Gilded-Age</a> charm, with its lace curtains, wood panelling and portraits. Walking down Main Street among the brightly coloured shopfronts, swinging saloon doors and clockhouse, the town's gold and silver mining history felt like it happened just days ago.</p> <p>From Silverton a two-hour drive of dramatic bends, sheer drops, frozen waterfalls and a high mountain pass brought us to American celeb's favourite, Telluride. Here we found fantastic hike-to inbounds terrain, many reached in 1\u00bd hour's walk from a lift. Palmyra Peak, at just over 4,000m, and one and half hour's hike from the lift, was the standout, if your knocking knees can get past the super steep couloir at the start.</p> <p>Another two hours on from Telluride is Monarch; a very different resort. Small, low-key and affordable, it has a retro, family feel, and one of the oldest ski runs in Colorado \u2013 the Gunbarrel which opened in 1939. The tight tree skiing, natural hits and drops, and minimal queues, even on a powder day made for a fun stay. There are also 130 acres of steep, expert-only backcountry terrain in the Mirkwood Basin, which you can either hike to or reach on a snowcat.</p> <p>Hotels can be found nearer the resort but we stayed in the old railway town of Salida, a 20-minute drive away, and enjoyed the red-brick buildings, thrift shops and real ale-touting gastro bars downtown. From there we completed our loop with a three-and-a-half-hour drive to Denver, where, of course, fat flakes of snow were just starting to fall.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Visit Colorado (<a href=\"http://www.colorado.com/\" title=\"\">colorado.com</a>) provided accommodation at the Rochester Hotel (<a href=\"http://rochesterhotel.com/\" title=\"\">rochesterhotel.com</a>) and Teller House Hotel (<a href=\"http://www.tellerhouse.com/\" title=\"\">tellerhouse.com</a>), guiding through Kling Mountain Guides (<a href=\"http://klingmountainguides.com/\" title=\"\">klingmountainguides.com</a>), San Juan Snowcat Skiing (<a href=\"http://sanjuanski.com/\" title=\"\">sanjuanski.com</a>) and Silverton Mountain (<a href=\"http://silvertonmountain.com/page/home\" title=\"\">silvertonmountain.com</a>), and a return flight with British Airways from Heathrow to Denver (<a href=\"http://www.britishairways.com/travel/globalgateway.jsp/global/public/en_\" title=\"\">ba.com</a>), and United Airlines from Denver to Durango (<a href=\"https://www.united.com/web/en-US/default.aspx?SID=13CF4F7F7D584188B0DF6E88954B3314\" title=\"\">united.com</a>).

  "<p>Jonjo Shelvey commenced his second longest walk against Manchester United last month with a grievance and a sense of shame. Sent off under a global spotlight in a harsh defeat and Liverpool's first home game since the Hillsborough Independent Panel had revealed the truth, he had ended the first with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/23/liverpool-manchester-united-match-report\" title=\"\">furious tirade at Sir Alex Ferguson</a>. \"That walk felt like a mile,\" he says.</p> <p>The next trek was from players' lounge to car park after the game. A figure appeared before him in the narrow Anfield corridor. Ferguson. \"It was a bit&#xa0; \u2026\" Shelvey does not complete the sentence. He grimaces, raises his shoulders and laughs at the awkwardness of the encounter instead. As with Jonny Evans earlier, this was a challenge he could not pull out of.</p> <p>\"I'd seen him [Ferguson] in the fourth official's ear after I made the tackle so as I was walking off I said: 'It's your fault I got sent off.' I knew I was in the wrong and then afterwards, as I was walking down the tunnel with my mate and his girlfriend, Ferguson was walking towards me. I just pulled him and apologised for what I had done.</p> <p>\"I said I was wrong and frustrated, I'm a young boy and emotions had got the better of me. But I told him I wouldn't have pulled out of the tackle if it was there. He said it was fine, that it takes a man to apologise, it was an emotional game and there are no hard feelings.\"</p> <p>The initial instinct to berate Ferguson, the apology for it and the defence of the tackle on Evans that prompted the red card say a lot about the 20-year-old. Single-mindedness has been a feature of his rise from Romford to Liverpool regular under Brendan Rodgers and now, courtesy of a substitute's appearance against San&#xa0;Marino, England international. It was there in his decision to leave Arsenal as a nine-year-old, when he walked out of his boyhood favourites, West Ham United, and rejected a move to Chelsea in favour of first-team football with Charlton Athletic. It will be there in his approach to Sunday's Merseyside derby at Everton.</p> <p>\"My dad brought me up to respect people but if you have your opinion and feel you're in the right, not to be afraid to say it,\" he explains. \"I think that counts in all aspects of life. You have to fear no one \u2013 except for our manager here. Stevie [Gerrard] and Carra [Jamie Carragher] have that attitude as well.</p> <p>\"They are born with it. It is about wanting to be a winner and a lot of games can be won on who wants it the most. I still stand by my decision that I wasn't going to pull out of that tackle. If I had pulled out I would have hurt myself and the fans would have gone mental.\"</p> <p>Shelvey cost Liverpool \u00a31.7m from Charlton in 2010, his arrival coming days before the departure of Rafael Ben\u00edtez as manager and following a journey his Irish-traveller grandfather must have appreciated. \"I was at Arsenal but I didn't like the manager of the under-10s at the time so I went to West Ham where my brother played.</p> <p>\"My dad was a coach at West Ham and thought my brother was being treated unfairly so he pulled him away from it. He said he would support me if I wanted to stay at West Ham, it was my decision, but I stuck with my brother and left.</p> <p>\"I had a year out playing local football before I went to Charlton at 12. West Ham was the&#xa0;club I supported so it was a hard decision to leave. Glenn Roeder was manager and he tried to make me stay but I couldn't. I've been brought up to be very family-oriented. I showed loyalty to my&#xa0;brother.\"</p> <p>One afternoon at The Valley, Shelvey looked up at the directors' box and spotted Kenny Dalglish sat among the suits. His career choices and his talent had paid off. \"Rafa was Liverpool manager but Kenny had a big part in signing me,\" the midfielder says. \"Chelsea had been in and&#xa0;said if I joined I'd go into their development squad. I was enjoying my time at Charlton, I was playing first-team football with a good set of lads and, to me, it would have been a step backwards to join Chelsea even though they are a big&#xa0;club.</p> <p>\"From day one at Liverpool I have been involved in the first team. I remember coming up here the first time with my mum, my dad and my sister. We went to the training ground to meet Rafa. He took us into his office and started talking to my mum about Stoke and how they play the long ball. Mum was like: 'I don't really care about Stoke.' But it showed just how much Rafa loves football.\"</p> <p>Including Ben\u00edtez, though he would never play for him, Shelvey is on his fourth Liverpool manager in less than three years, a&#xa0;period that has also included a fruitful loan spell with Ian Holloway at &#xa0;Blackpool.</p> <p>\"Ian Holloway was first class and gave you the belief that you would always be playing, which is very important as a young lad,\" he says. \"We even had to wash our own kit. Well, my girlfriend did it.\"</p> <p>Roy Hodgson gave Shelvey his debut for Liverpool, and for England, and Dalglish increasingly exposed the midfielder to the demands and pressures of the first team. But he has truly impressed under Rodgers, making far greater impact in front of goal, in possession and in the tackle.</p> <p>\"Brendan has put his trust in me and I want to keep repaying him,\" he says. \"It has been a rollercoaster this season because of the sending-off against United but there have been more positives than negatives. I am enjoying life.</p> <p>\"It is magnificent to say I've played for England but I'm sure it helped me that Roy was manager at Liverpool before. He knew what I could do. But the whole setup made me feel very welcome. I was nervous going in there on the Monday morning. I didn't know what to expect and thought no one would talk to me. I'd gone very quickly from playing in a park with my mates to sitting next to Wayne Rooney at dinner. It was a bit weird.</p> <p>\"Danny Welbeck pulled me when I arrived and said: 'Leave my manager alone.' That broke the ice.\"</p>",
  "<p>China has lashed out at a US newspaper report that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html?_r=1\" title=\"\">premier Wen Jiabao's family has amassed vast wealth</a> worth at least $2.7bn (\u00a31.68bn), censoring the New York Times website and questioning the paper's motivations.</p> <p>The story said Wen, widely seen as the humane face of China's top leadership, was not directly linked to the holdings. But the association with such a fortune was in stark contrast to the man-of-the-people image he has cultivated.</p> <p>A foreign ministry spokesman said the report \"blackens China's name and has ulterior motives\". Censors blocked the paper's Chinese language website, at least partially obstructed access to its main site, and banned microblog searches for New York Times in English and Chinese.</p> <p>\"China manages the internet in accordance with laws and rules,\" spokesman Hong Lei told reporters when asked why the sites were inaccessible.</p> <p>The detailed account, based on company and regulatory filings, said several of Wen's relatives had become extremely wealthy since his ascent to the top leadership, controlling assets whose total worth is more than the GDP of Burundi. In many cases their holdings were obscured by layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, colleagues or business partners.</p> <p>The report is damaging not only to Wen, but also to the Communist party. It has faced months of unwelcome scrutiny while preparing for a once-in-a-decade leadership transition \u2013 mostly thanks to the scandal surrounding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/bo-xilai-trial-neil-heywood-murder\" title=\"\">disgraced leader Bo Xilai</a> and his wife Gu Kailai's conviction for murdering a British businessman. On Friday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/bo-xilai-expelled-chinese-parliament\" title=\"\">Bo was expelled from the country's legislature</a>, as expected, paving the way for his prosecution. He has been accused of corruption and abuse of power.</p> <p>There has been a spate of revelations about wealth amassed by people around other senior figures. <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-29/xi-jinping-millionaire-relations-reveal-fortunes-of-elite.html\" title=\"\">Authorities blocked the Bloomberg website</a> earlier this year after it exposed the multi-million dollar assets held by the extended family of Xi Jinping, heir-apparent to the presidency. It has also reported that Bo's relatives accumulated at least $136m in assets.</p> <p>The top leaders \"are like paranoid, flying eagles,\" said Edward Friedman, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"If you are looking up they look like the most powerful creatures in the world. But what they see is what a long fall it would be. I think in their consciousness it is very much about all the things that could go wrong.\"</p> <p>He added that, at least among politically-conscious people in urban areas of China, there seemed to have been a tremendous shift in mood since 2008, with patriotic pride and suspicion about the west giving way to a growing sense that the regime does not care about them.</p> <p>Steve Tsang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Nottingham, said of the US report: \"It's the kind of story where the leadership is united.\"Wen is implicated, Bo down \u2026 Who's next? Part of the arrangement is that someone leaving power is still protected after he leaves office, so that the system will continue.\"</p> <p>Given the bad blood known to exist between Wen and Bo, many anticipate supporters of the latter will seize on the report with glee. Others wonder if it may reduce Wen's future influence. Although he is due to retire as premier, former leaders still play a significant role in the party's decision-making.</p> <p>Many people \u2013 particularly among the elite \u2013 had been aware of rumours about Wen's relatives. But the scale of the reported assets is striking and the timing highly sensitive.</p> <p>While one <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo\" title=\"\">Sina Weibo</a> user described the report as a shock, another wrote: \"Looking at the numbers, I think it is still conservative.\"</p> <p>Both remarks were swiftly deleted, as were other references to the New York Times story. A BBC News report on the piece was also blocked in Beijing. Censorship means many in China will remain unaware of the US account.</p> <p>Wen has repeatedly urged China's leaders to ensure their families and associates do not abuse government influence, and pushed for officials to disclose the assets of their immediate families. Declarations are not public and the New York Times said four-fifths of the assets it found were held by relatives not covered by party rules, including his mother and various in-laws.</p> <p>A former government colleague of Wen, speaking anonymously, told the New York Times: \"In the senior leadership, there's no family that doesn't have these problems \u2026 His enemies are intentionally trying to smear him by letting this leak out.\"</p> <p>A US diplomatic cable obtained by Wikileaks, dating from 2007, quoted an executive in Shanghai as saying: \"Wen is disgusted with his family's activities, but is either unable or unwilling to curtail them.\"</p> <p>In March, the premier made an emotional defence of his tenure during his annual press conference, saying history would have the final say and stressing that he had never pursued personal gain.</p> <p>Substantial holdings in the name of Wen's mother and other relatives were held via an investment vehicle run by a wealthy businesswoman close to Wen's wife, Zhang Beili. Duan Weihong told the New York Times the investments were her own. She sought a low profile so had asked relatives to find others to hold the shares on her behalf. They had \"by accident\" chosen the premier's relatives.</p> <p>Zhang Beili, who is rarely seen with her husband, works in the diamond trade. Their son Winston Wen runs New Horizon Capital, one of China's biggest private equity funds.</p> <p>His wife Yang Xiaomeng told the New York Times: \"Everything that has been written about him has been wrong. He's really not doing that much business any more.\"</p> <p>The Times said members of Wen's family declined to comment or did not respond.</p> <p>Separately, the Brookings Institution said the brother of the man expected to replace Wen \u2013 vice premier Li Keqiang \u2013 should be moved from his senior post at China's state-owned tobacco monopoly. Li oversees public health as part of his duties.</p> <p>His younger brother, Li Keming, is deputy director of the tobacco body and Cheng Li, author of the Brookings report, suggested his role might have set back attempts to curb tobacco use in China.</p>",
  "<p>When children are imperiled we have two usual responses: those opposing twins, minimisation and hysteria. This week we saw hysteria, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/23/jimmy-savile-witch-hunt-paranoia\" title=\"\">in the Jimmy Savile case</a>; even the BBC wobbled in the tide of anger, too late to save a single child. Now the hysteria calms, we await the minimisation over child poverty. Balance has fled.</p> <p>This week Iain Duncan Smith, who deports himself with the grave charity of Jane Eyre's Mr Brocklehurst doing harm to do good, suggested <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/25/iain-duncan-smith-benefit-cuts\" title=\"\">limiting child benefit to the first two children</a> if the parents are unemployed. If you work, his idea goes, you are helped; if you don't, you are punished, even as hundreds chase every job. To support this dull demonisation of poverty, he conjured the usual monsters, so voters might forget he is actually attacking them. Out came the nightmare visions of millions of feckless parents having children out of spite, which entirely ignores the truth that the poor, when in work, work harder than anyone, for fewer rewards.</p> <p>This government has always struggled to define the enemy, as it holds hands with tax exiles and billionaires. Better to blame newborn babies and their \u00a313.40 a week. Oh, those selfish children \u2013 more, you say? You want more? They are the taxpayers of the future, but that is too far off to matter.</p> <p>The details, of course, are vague. I&#xa0;would be surprised if a woman pregnant with triplets was encouraged to abort the third, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/jeremy-hunt-12-week-abortion-limit\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt and his 12-week fantasies</a> sitting primly at the Department of Health. Will a woman who is employed when she conceives keep her benefits if she is fired before she gives birth? Full-time jobs are rare and shrinking \u2013 where will they draw the line? Almost all new jobs are part-time and insecure \u2013 what will happen? Does it even matter? Children, like criminals, don't vote.</p> <p>This is part of the swift descent into poverty for many children wretched enough to live in coalition-land; for them, the view from the window is not the <a href=\"http://www.inthenightgarden.co.uk/en/default.asp\" title=\"\">Night Garden</a>. Tories attack the way we measure poverty, because it muddies the waters, and in the confusion their policies are considered \"fair\". Sixty&#xa0;per cent or less of median income is the internationally accepted figure for living in poverty and there was a decade of progress from 1997, which took poverty to the lowest rates in 25 years. The \"patchwork\" of Labour measures that Duncan Smith derides, many of which have gone or are under threat \u2013 Sure Start, the education maintenance allowance, free books, welfare to work \u2013 were complex, but they worked, taking 1.1&#xa0;million children out of poverty, and preventing 1 million from falling into it. We missed the 2020 target of eradication, but we would, had the trajectory continued, have made it by 2027, the not-too-distant lands.</p> <p>Then came the coalition. The pre-power rhetoric was characteristically seductive and entirely untrue. \"We can make British poverty history and we will make British poverty history,\" <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2007/10/David_Cameron_Making_British_Poverty_History.aspx\" title=\"\">said David Cameron in 2007</a>. \"It falls to us, the modern Conservative party, to fight for the poorest,\" <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/News/Speeches/2009/10/David_Cameron_Putting_Britain_back_on_her_feet.aspx\" title=\"\">he said in 2009</a>.</p> <p>It&#xa0;was, of course, nonsense; the \u00a320bn of welfare cuts by 2014 will, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, throw 80,000 children back into poverty each year, or 300,000 over the lifetime of the parliament. The Department for Work and Pensions puts the number of children <a href=\"http://www.cpag.org.uk/child-poverty-facts-and-figures\" title=\"\">currently in poverty at 27%</a>, or 3.6 million children, two thirds of them living in working families; by 2020 it will be 4.2 million. Will there be blanket coverage of the coming miseries? I doubt it. The government has successfully framed the debate: it won't affect you; only them \u2013 and they deserve it.</p> <p>The fact that fewer than 5% of those on jobseeker's allowance and income support have more than three children, and more than 65% have no children at all, will not be mentioned in the coming&#xa0;fight. Civil servants and <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/research/special-advisers\" title=\"\">spads</a> will look for unrepresentative case studies to sell the policy to the middle \u2013 divide and rule.</p> <p>Expect photos of 11-children families in state-funded mansions to grace the pages of the Daily Mail; they will be told to grin for the cameras. Addicts \u2013 only 4% of the poor \u2013 will be mentioned, as if everyone having a third child sucks down crack all day, and laughs. Osborne's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/15/benefit-cap-london-poor-families\" title=\"\">beloved cap of \u00a326,000 in benefits</a> for one family is equally misleading \u2013 only 1% of families get that much \u2013 but they will be found, and photographed, to undermine the ideal of welfare state. This is government by tabloid; if poverty and cuts to social services create terrible incidents, expect the rightwing press to flail at the cognitive dissonance, like a man stabbing his own face.</p> <p>Nor will the fact that cuts shrink the economy, and make poverty a vicious circle, be mentioned. The IMF global outlook reported this month that for every pound that is cut, GDP will contract by up to \u00a31.70. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation says the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cpag.org.uk%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2FBad%2520Friday.pdf&amp;ei=L9WKUMKDLMXRhAefjYHoAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNE-jSEJOsIs_9Rd9M0ZO7-114nvUA\" title=\"\">annual cost to the UK's GDP of child poverty is \u00a325bn</a>, while only \u00a3200m will be saved by limiting child benefit to two children.

  "<p>Amanda Todd, a teenager who lived in the Vancouver area, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/11/amanda-todd-suicide-bullying_n_1959909.html\">died</a> earlier this month by her own hand. Shortly before she killed herself, she made a YouTube video describing the bullying she had suffered both in school and after school that had driven her to abuse drugs and alcohol, and self-harm \u2013and which would, ultimately, result in her suicide. She described boys tormenting her, and girls beating her so severely that, when they were done, she simply lay in a ditch until her father found her.</p> <p>What caused the bullying that pursued her so viciously? </p> <p>In seventh grade, Todd had logged onto a webcam site where <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/10/amanda-todd-michael-brutsch-and-free-speech-online.html\">she met</a> a 30-year-old man who cajoled her into showing him her breasts. When she sought to withdraw from the man's persistent attentions, he contacted her via Facebook. He threatened to send the topless photos of her to \"everyone\" if she did not \"put on a show\".</p> <p>Unfortunately for Todd, it was no empty threat: the man had obtained her personal data, including where she lived and went to school, and made good on his word. When she changed schools to avoid the people who had seen the uncensored photo, he made it his profile picture on Facebook.</p> <p>The media, as well as the girl's school, have stressed the issue of bullying in this story, but they must also address adult male cyberstalking and the influence of porn on teenage social interaction. The last two issues are often considered too \"difficult\" to address in the mainstream, even though their influences are very much ingrained in the mainstream.</p> <p>In fact, Todd's case is not an isolated one. At <a href=\"http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765583658/As-many-as-20-of-teens-have-sexted.html?pg=all\">least two American girls</a> have reportedly committed suicide after their former boyfriends, following a break-up, forwarded nude photos of them.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barbara-greenberg/sexting_b_1603160.html\">study</a> in the peer-reviewed journal Archives of Sexual Behavior found that almost 18% of high school students \u2013 boys and girls, some as young as 14 \u2013 acknowledged sending \"explicit\" images of themselves on cellphones to other students. Previous studies had just asked about \"provocative\" images, which are not illegal (nude images of minors are). In the survey group of 600 private high school students from the US south-west, 30% of girls reported having received an \"explicit\" image, while 50% of boys did. (The difference between the numbers of self-reported senders and receivers had to do with forwarding, according to the researchers.)</p> <p>Most students left a question that sought to ascertain their awareness of the illegality of this kind of sexting blank. In other words, the students did not understand that what they were doing was illegal.</p> <p>How has the influence of pornography created such an ungated torrent of sexually explicit images that invades lives like Todd's? And why, in a consumer culture in which you can buy anything, is it so difficult to place real filters against such intrusions?</p> <p>As a free-speech advocate, I believe that adults should have access to any material they want. As a parent, and a community member, I think people should be able to protect their homes from imagery \u2013 much of it violent \u2013 that is, I feel, a form of child abuse when adult society inflicts it upon children. Porn is one such example of imagery that has come to be a powerfully negative influence on youth culture. </p> <p>The ownership of the porn industry is, oddly, cloaked in mystery (though we know that Goldman Sachs <a href=\"http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/31/the-secret-owners-behind-a-prostitution-website/\">recently</a> got out of the lucrative prostitution listings business). It is also hard to establish the actual money involved: estimates for the value of the porn industry range from <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=585537n&amp;tag=contentMain;contentBody\">$10bn</a> a year to <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2010-03-02-porn02_ST_N.htm \">$13bn</a> (for the US market alone). Neither of these figures is as striking as the 2009 United Nations estimate of the value of the porn industry worldwide: $100bn, with child porn accounting for $20bn. </p> <p>Why is ownership and revenue data in this huge industry so opaque? Authors Melinda Tankard Reist and Abigail Bray of Big Porn Inc: Exposing the Harms of the Global Pornography Industry argue that \"porn money\" has bought up research departments in universities, and contributed to governmental lobbying efforts. If true, that would certainly help to explain the absence of any practical controls that would keep the industry freely available in a strongly filtered adults-only space. </p> <p>This free market inundation of explicit imagery is certainly affecting teens. Guidance counselors in Manhattan schools, as well as schools in the US midwest, have expressed their concerns with me that online images, \"sexting\" and homemade erotic videos are all increasingly used to torment and isolate kids \u2013 especially by \"slut-shaming\" girls and young women.</p> <p>Caught in an impossible double bind, teenaged girls are encouraged by the ubiquity of porn's influence to post suggestive, racy pictures of themselves on their Facebook pages or via other social media, and even engage \u2013 as Amanda Todd did \u2013 in more direct, self-revealing behavior online that is then captured forever. In a vacuum of any responsible adult conversation about privacy, dealing with porn imagery and chat rooms, or appropriate sexual behavior, these girls are left to the mercy of an industry setting the bar for their interactions. That then becomes the behavioral norm for both sexes in youth culture.</p> <p>The outcome? This dangerous proliferation of teenagers using technology to paint scarlet letters on girls that are practically impossible to delete from cyberspace. How many Amanda Todds will there be before we act on this problem?</p>",
  "<p>It is one of the world's largest hedge funds, with $121bn under management, but its name is virtually unknown in financial circles. Braeburn Capital is not operated from the top floor of a Manhattan skyscraper or a plush Mayfair townhouse. It is located in a quiet suburb of Nevada's capital, Reno, and it belongs to Apple.</p> <p>In a nondescript building opposite an abandoned restaurant, a small number of advisers have been charged with investing the cash pile Apple has amassed thanks to the seemingly insatiable global appetite for its consumer electronics.</p> <p>That pile has grown from $9bn when Braeburn was established in 2006 to more than $120bn (\u00a375bn), according to Apple's financial results on Thursday. That is a shade less than the $130bn Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in America and probably the world, has under management.</p> <p>Much of Apple's money is trapped overseas, sheltered from the US taxman, who would demand a 35% cut were the money to be repatriated. But it can be invested at home. Apple's financial reports show it holds $21bn of US government debt \u2013 a vast sum for a single private investor. Foreign governments like investing in US securities, but Apple owns more than the $19bn held by Malaysia, and just $4bn less than Spain.</p> <p>Apple's largest investment category is corporate securities. It has $44.5bn in company shares, more than the entire $39bn managed by Man Group, the UK's largest hedge fund. It is also a big holder of other nations' debt, with $7bn invested in sovereign securities abroad.</p> <p>Little is known about which companies Apple invests in. It occasionally owns stakes large enough to be declared: Apple was a founding investor in British chip designer ARM, but has sold out, and owns 9% of Hertfordshire-based Imagination Technologies, which designs video and audio chips.</p> <p>Braeburn does not file a record with the American stock market regulator, or the Investment Adviser Public Disclosure register; it is not an independent adviser but a division of a private company.</p> <p>It is free to hold any assets \u2013 for all anyone knows they could be short positions on the shares of its major rivals such as Samsung and Google, or the sub-prime mortgages of American homeowners, lumped together and traded on the financial markets. Indeed, it declares ownership of nearly $9bn of mortgage and asset-backed securities, according to filings.</p> <p>The decision to locate Braeburn in Nevada rather than Apple's home state of California makes sense because Nevada does not collect corporation tax or capital gains tax. California, by contrast, has a corporate tax rate of 8.84%, a rate of contribution to the public coffers that has not been enough to prevent a school funding crisis in a state that houses some of the world's most valuable companies. Managing its money from Nevada also allows Apple to lower its tax bills in other states. Florida, New Jersey and New Mexico discount taxes when a company's financial management is in another jurisdiction.</p> <p>In 2006, Apple listed only cash and short term investments in its filings, but Braeburn's managers are expected to take the long view. Apple now holds nearly $90bn of its money in \"long-term marketable securities\".</p> <p>According to analysis by the New York Times, since founding Braeburn, Apple has earned more than $2.5bn in interest and dividend income on its cash reserves and investments around the globe.</p> <p>Apple declined to comment on Braeburn's activities, but in the year its investment arm was established, an Apple spokesman explained that it would function as a regional treasury office, on a par with existing offices at its Cupertino headquarters, in Singapore and in Cork, Ireland.</p> <p>The Nevada Annual Report, a register of companies located in the state, lists three Braeburn officers: Apple attorney Gene Levoff, Michael Shapiro and Gary Wipfler, who as Apple's treasurer is the person officially responsible for the management of the technology titan's billions.</p> <p>Various Braeburn employees have filled in pared down profiles on LinkedIn, the corporate networking site, including Steve Johnson, who claims to be chief investment officer, and Rhys Gray, a chartered financial accountant previously employed by investment management firm Payden &amp; Rygel.</p> <p>Ted Mulvaney describes himself as a portfolio manager at Braeburn, and is also linked to Magrathea Financial Services, a Reno based investment firm named after a Hitch-Hiker's guide to the Galaxy planet, known as one of the wealthiest in the universe due to its extraordinary trade \u2013 building customised planets to order.</p> <p>Braeburn's team may be modest, but its scope is galactic.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/new-york-times-china-wen-jiabao\">New York Times' unraveling of the holdings of the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, and his family</a> may be its most direct challenge to a sitting government since its publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971. Arguably, its forensic accounting, will be even much more damaging and potentially transformational to the Chinese government than its seminal revelations about the roots of the war in Vietnam were to the Nixon government. </p> <p>As with the Pentagon Papers, the Times now faces the concerted wrath of the government it has challenged. The Nixon administration took the Times to the US supreme court, in a move that threatened to criminalize the company. The Chinese government has cordoned off the Times' digital reach into China and, effectively, declared it persona non grata in one of the world's most significant markets.</p> <p>In other words, it's a great day.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html?_r=1&amp;hp\">The Times' story, by David Barboza</a>, is the type of journalism that not only catches the powerful in flagrante delicto, but that revivifies the paper's reason for being. This has not been a kind few years for the Times, with its management, its journalism, and its <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/01/new-york-times-arthur-sulzberger\">prospects, under constant and more often than not unflattering scrutiny</a>. But a story like this is something of an instant brand turnaround.</p> <p>The New York Times took on China and, in the first round, won. This being China, the Times will, surely, be engaged in a constant battle going forward \u2013 even, perhaps, a confrontation that defines the sides in some new international press battle. That will, no doubt, be to its short term economic disadvantage. But that is good news for the Times, too. </p> <p>Newspapers, beleaguered everywhere by changing distribution and advertising models, can only prove their real worth by showing their unique power. The New York Times just meaningfully altered the future of China. Even if the Chinese can prevent anyone in China from reading the Times story \u2013 which they cannot \u2013 the rest of the world, from here on in, understands China in a different context.

  "<p>Regulations covering building standards, including fire safety and wheelchair access, could be torn up in a government plan to cut costs for the construction industry and boost the economy.</p> <p>Ministers have ordered a wide-ranging review covering all aspects of building regulations, also including standards on energy efficiency. The review, which controversially includes the option of giving the building industry more scope for self-regulation, is the latest in a series of government initiatives intended to stimulate activity in the economy and drive job creation through investment in homebuilding.</p> <p>Its aim is to prune regulations \"significantly\". Last month, the government announced a year-long free-for-all in house extensions, allowing homeowners to build up to eight metres into their gardens without planning permission.</p> <p>Despite encouraging figures this week showing that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/25/gdp-recession-growth-politics-live-blog\" title=\"\">UK economy came out of recession at the end of the summer</a>, the construction sector is still in the doldrums, contracting by 2.5% in the third quarter of the year. The coalition knows it needs much stronger recovery to win voters' support and housebuilding is seen as a key area for creating relatively quick investment and jobs.</p> <p>Ministers have also been under intense pressure to deal with a housing crisis that has seen the building of new homes falling to the lowest level since the 1920s, causing rocketing rents and a generation potentially priced out of the market.</p> <p>Among the specific themes under examination are energy, water, security, accessibility, and even the amount of space available in new homes.</p> <p>The review has prompted fears of a bonfire of standards \u2013 including crucial structural issues, fire and security, and government pledges to cut carbon emissions and water use, improve local communities and help elderly and disabled people live independently.</p> <p>\"What they are saying is everything is up for debate,\" said Paul King, chief executive of one of the review group members, the <a href=\"http://www.ukgbc.org/\" title=\"\">UK Green Building Council</a>. \"These things [regulations] stop people from building houses that fall down on people or burn down, so it's pretty important.\"</p> <p>In the terms of reference, seen by the Guardian, the Department for Communities and Local Government says that the housing standards review should be \"rationalising the entire framework of building regulations and national and local housing standards\", with the overall goal to \"significantly\" cut back on the number of regulations.</p> <p>As part of the review, a special four-man \"challenge panel\" will have \"free rein, unconstrained\" to suggest ways of cutting regulations that would \"deliver demonstrable deregulation to make homebuilding easier\".It adds that the panel \"will not be constrained by previous or existing policy\". The review has been launched just weeks after the Department of Energy and Climate Change introduced its flagship <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/01/green-deal-energy-efficiency\" title=\"\">\"Green Deal\" policy aimed at retrofitting 14m UK homes</a> to make them more energy-efficient.</p> <p>One organisation involved in the review said it had support from the top of the government, including David Cameron, George Osborne, and the Cabinet Office minister and general enforcer Oliver Letwin. The group, which held its first meeting on Tuesday, is expected to report to ministers by the spring.The DCLG told the Guardian the review would only apply to home building standards, though as the building code applies to all buildings this raises the possibility of two sets of standards replacing one.</p> <p>\"The government is determined to support developers and councils to get on with the job of building the high-quality new homes the country needs,\" said a department spokesman. \"The current system of overlapping different standards is complex and confusing to local residents and developers. This will make way for a simpler set of housing standards that ensure buildings are still made to exacting standards.\"</p> <p>The Home Builders Federation, a member of the review group, welcomed the initiative, citing a host of regulations, often voluntary ones that local authorities can choose to insist on (or not), which it believes are outdated or too expensive.</p> <p>Among these are the code for sustainable homes, which suggests new homes should have a room to use as an office so more people can work from home and avoid commuting; and the lifetime homes regulations, which specify doors and bathrooms must be wide enough for wheelchairs and a piece of wall and floor can be easily removed to make space for a hoist or lift, all so that future owners who are elderly or disabled can adapt their homes more easily. Others include security regulations that specify the minimum width of a walkway next to a home and that every new home should have a burglar alarm fitted.</p> <p>\"Hopefully from the current process we will get a standardised set of sensible, viable standards so that everybody knows what they are working to,\" said Steve Turner, the federation's head of communications.</p> <p>In a serious blow to the government's approach, however, at least two large construction firms expressed doubts about the importance of regulation as a barrier to building, insisting that making it easier for small developers and homebuyers to borrow money, the reform of planning and freeing up more publicly owned land were more important, and even warned that a rush to lower standards could slow down new building.</p> <p>Stephen Stone, chief executive of Crest Nicholson, one of the country's biggest housebuilders, said building regulations were relatively unimportant as a barrier to new homebuilding, and a rush to lower standards would make it harder for companies to persuade local communities to release land that was desperately needed to build on. \"If you are going to engage with local communities you want to be doing so when you know you can produce well-designed, well-built homes that are built within a regulatory framework,\" he said.</p> <p>\"None of us want to go back to poor design, poor building standards and low energy efficiency. It might be good for reducing costs but this industry needs to be taking a view that a house needs to [last] 100 years \u2013 therefore why shouldn't society demand very high standards?\"</p> <p>While some have warned that any review of regulations could create a hiatus while developers wait to see the new rules before committing to new projects, Stone said the government could not rely on any boost to homebuilding before the next general election, due in 2015. \"Having an impact is probably three or four years away,\" he said.</p> <p>Hilary Benn, shadow communities and local government secretary, said: \"No one is opposed to sensible rationalisation but building regulations exist for a reason. What we mustn't lose is proper building standards and requirements to build much more sustainable homes in future that use less water and energy, given our climate is changing and we need to significantly reduce our use of carbon.\"</p>",
  "<p>Of the two big political transitions ahead of us next month, it is clear which will receive most attention and be the easiest to read. The US presidential election, in spite of some uncertainties about Mr Romney's real position on many issues, is a straightforward and dramatic electoral contest. It will be comprehensively covered everywhere, and its outcome exhaustively analysed. The replacement of China's leadership at the 18th party congress, a couple of days after the American vote, is, by contrast, already foreordained. It looks like Chinese business as usual, and will be an almost entirely opaque process, as unclear in its implications after it is over as it is before it has begun. Yet it is arguably the more important of the two.</p> <p>This is not because China is a bigger power than America, which it is not, and which it may never become. It is because China's accumulated problems are so numerous and its need for reform and renewal so evident that the course its leaders set in the next five years could be more critical for the world than the choices a single American president will make in the four years at his disposal. Ever since it became possible to talk about Chinese politics in something like western terms, outsiders have hoped for reforms that will take the country in the direction of the rule of law and democracy, and reduce its dependence on a combination of nationalism and consumerism as a source of legitimacy. So have many, although it is unclear how many, Chinese. These expectations have usually been disappointed, because both the party and the people in China are frightened of too much change \u2013 the party because it worries that it will lose its grip, and ordinary people because of the memory of the chaos and cruelty of earlier times. However angry they are about official corruption and mismanagement, they fear any lurch into the unknown.</p> <p>Corruption is a key to many aspects of the Chinese situation. As the distinguished British sinologist Roderick MacFarquhar recently argued, high-level Chinese corruption is not just theft. Together with the export of assets abroad, and the despatch of sons and daughters to foreign schools and universities, it suggests that the party brass lacks <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/opinion/in-china-fear-at-the-top.html\" title=\"\">confidence in the future</a>. Mao and the other earlier leaders had won the war against the nationalists, created a pervasive and effective party apparatus, and spread an ideology which was widely accepted. All of this is now in the distant past, to the point that, as MacFarquhar writes: \"Globalising one's assets\u2026 makes sense as a hedge against risk.\" The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">revelations</a> in the New York Times this week about the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, will undoubtedly find their way past the state's information filters, and their impact will be the more severe because he has been a relatively popular leader. The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/bo-xilai-expelled-chinese-parliament\" title=\"\"> expulsion </a>of the disgraced Bo Xilai from the party and, yesterday, from parliament, for, among other offences, corruption, is hardly likely to convince a sceptical populace that China's leaders are ready to clean up their act.</p> <p>But that is what a new leadership must do, if it is to transform a society \"unstable at the grass roots, dejected in the middle strata, and out of control at the top\", which is how some Chinese scholars apparently described their country at a recent <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21565132-china%E2%80%99s-communist-party-preparing-its-ten-yearly-change-leadership-new-team\" title=\"\">conference</a> near Shanghai. Similarly, Deng Yuwen, a senior editor at one of the party's journals, has argued that the achievements of the last decade of growth may be outweighed by its failures, especially the <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/america-the-gutted/china-middle-class-economic-growth-wealth-disparity\" title=\"\">\"failure to nurture and grow a middle class\".</a> The most serious failure of all, as the Chinese writer <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2100133,00.html\" title=\"\">Yu Hua</a> has said, is the erosion of political belief and meaning to the point where, as he suggests, the phrase \"the people\" has become \"nothing more than a shell company, utilised by different eras to position different products in the marketplace\". Put that way, there is indeed a long way to go in China.</p>",
  "<p>Education is crucial to the future of the US, both as a gateway to the middle class and to secure a competitive edge in the global talent pool. Both Democrats and Republicans are concerned that rising tuition is putting college out of reach for too many people \u2013 potentially blighting the country's future prosperity as higher education expands rapidly around the world. Both parties are concerned by international comparisons that show the academic performance of US high school students is relatively mediocre. But when it comes to solving these problems, there are marked differences between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.</p> <p>In schools, the president has pushed for increased accountability for teachers, by tying teacher evaluations to students' results in standardized tests. He has promoted charter schools, which are state-funded but independently run, giving parents an alternative to traditional public schools.</p> <p>Romney supports both these goals, but is also keen to provide federal cash for school vouchers that would educate children in private or religious schools at public expense.</p> <p>In higher education, the Republicans want to narrow the focus of the Pell Grant programme, which supports the poorest students. Romney also wants to loosen regulations on for-profit colleges, relying on competition to keep tuition costs down.</p> <p>Obama has raised the maximum Pell Grant award for the next academic year, and campaigned to persuade Congress to keep interest rates down on federal loans. He wants to curb the cost of tuition by using federal money to reward colleges that keep tuition affordable.</p> <p>In a three-part series, we explore the changing face of schools and universities in the US. The series looks at K12 education in New Orleans, where a a majority of schools are now charters and a voucher scheme allows tax dollars to follow children into private education. It examines school reforms begun in Florida, which have now inspired change across the country. And as states slash spending on higher education, it looks at the threats facing the public university system.</p>",
  "<p>The teacher's command of his class is total. \"Which one is the whole number?\" he asks crisply. \"Is it seven over three, or is it four?\"</p> <p>He zeroes in on a child who gives the right answer, then the next task: \"Seven over three divided by four over one? Hands, please \u2013 I'm looking for straight arms.\"</p> <p>The classes at Sci Academy, a charter school in New Orleans, feel like an assembly line; with each task stripped down to component parts, and the teacher orchestrating a brisk interaction that draws in students' bodies as well as their minds. They click fingers as a substitute for applause, or to show understanding, and sit poised to attention as the teacher moves around the room.</p> <p>New Orleans is a city that has been failed by government in the past, most tragically when Katrina struck. But one consequence of that disaster has been a root-and-branch transformation of its education system. </p> <p>The reforms had begun before Katrina, but the pace was accelerated after the disaster. It is now the only US city where a majority of public school pupils \u2013 around eight in ten \u2013 attend charter schools, which are non-unionised and enjoy a rare degree of operational independence from government.</p> <p>This academic year brings further change; under reforms brought in by Republican governor Bobby Jindal, poorer students attending poorly performing state schools can apply for vouchers to cover their fees at a private or religious school. Nearly 5,000 students in Louisiana have taken up the voucher programme, making it one of the most popular such initiatives nationally. Similar experiments are underway in several other states including Indiana and Ohio.</p> <p>The creation of a fully-fledged market in education is endorsed by Mitt Romney. If elected, the Republican candidate would provide $25bn in federal money to back school voucher systems.</p> <p>In education, as in health, vouchers are a dividing line between the parties. President Obama has embraced charter schools and increased accountability for teachers, but stops short of letting public money follow children to private schools.</p> <p>The pale blue corridors of Sci Academy, housed in a cluster of prefabricated blocks in New Orleans East, are lined with inspirational mottoes: \"Chase perfection, catch excellence,\" reads one. Another declares: \"We're never done, we're never finished\".</p> <p>The words are directed at students, but could apply just as well to the teachers, who are evaluated on each lesson. Staff here are regularly observed and receive constant feedback on their performance. Closer scrutiny of teachers \u2013 particularly the linking of evaluation to standardised test results \u2013 has been controversial nationally; it was one of the issues at stake in the Chicago teachers' strike.</p> <p>The goal in New Orleans is to reverse years of educational decline. Before Katrina, state schools here had become starkly segregated on race and class lines as white and middle class families removed their children.</p> <p>By 2004 one in three New Orleans students was at a private or religious school, compared with a national average of 11%. In high school exit exams that year, 96% of the city's public school students were below basic proficiency in English.</p> <p>In the years since Katrina, student performance in tests has improved, and fewer students now go to failing schools. Students have achieved a higher average score in the ACT test, which measures readiness for college.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.coweninstitute.com/\">A study by the Cowen Institute</a> at Tulane University notes the improvement, but is cautious about the reasons why. Many claims have been put forward \"but few have been proven by the available data,\" it says.</p> <p>John White, Louisiana's state superintendent of education, argues that decentralisation has freed schools to act in children's best interests. Charter schools, state-funded but independently run by non-profit groups, are now the norm in New Orleans. In the past school year, 78% of public school students were enrolled in charters. The proportion will rise this year. Such schools enjoy great flexibility in managing their time and allocating resources.</p> <p>White said: \"A lot of this is about ensuring that parents don't leave. It's really not the state that is the best vehicle for keeping parents in our schools, it's the schools, and how do you do that? You create a policy environment where choice is the norm, where schools have the freedom to improve and retain parents. We have a choice and competition model, where schools are competing for the interest of parents.\"</p> <p>In the New Orleans school market, where parents are purchasers and schools tout for custom, the state's role is increasingly to act as a regulator rather than a provider of services.</p> <p>In an attempt to ensure that schools don't game the system, a unified system of enrolment has been introduced for the whole city, with places at oversubscribed schools decided by lottery rather than how close the family lives. Schools must abide by the same rules on exclusions. A network of school buses provides transport, enabling families to choose a school distant from their home.</p> <p>Parents are motivated by a range of inducements, not just a school's academic achievement. Ava Lee, director of the Samuel J Green charter school, says some are attracted to the extended school day, in which children are offered a range of sporting and cultural activities from flag football to African dance. Others appreciate the school's healthy eating ethos; it has an \"edible schoolyard\" growing aubergines, kale, chillies and strawberries. Learning how to cook and eat healthily is on the curriculum here.</p> <p>Lee said: \"Schools receive a report card now, parents are savvy \u2013 they research online and see how a school is performing. It's no longer the neighbourhood school; it's really parent choice.\"</p> <p>The most controversial aspect of the Louisiana reforms is the extension of school choice outside the public system. A pilot voucher programme has existed in New Orleans since 2008, but has been expanded statewide under measures signed into law by Governor Jindal in April. Unlike the pilot, the new programme is open to children from kindergarten to 12th grade. Places at private schools are assigned by lottery and the state voucher covers tuition fees.</p> <h2>The new programme</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427478\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/26/1351259438636/Sci-Academy-in-New-Orlean-010.jpg\" alt=\"Sci Academy in New Orleans\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sci Academy in New Orleans. Photograph: Julie Dermansky for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Dermansky/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>Jack Loup, founder of the Coalition for Louisiana Public Education, argues that there is no evidence to support the view that private schools are better.</p> <p>\"They [private schools] have never taken any tests. I went to a parochial [church] school. I certainly have nothing against them. But they don't take any tests to prove they are doing better than other schools. All they have done is throw it out there, saying parents know what's best for their child \u2013 parents have no idea how well the school is teaching their child.\"</p> <p>The initiative has meant a significant boost to the enrolment of schools like the Life of Christ Christian Academy, a non-denominational religious school in New Orleans. The school, a neat brick cube in a neighbourhood of pastel-coloured shotgun houses, is now \"75% vouchers\", according to its principal and owner Cheryl Leufroy Frilot.</p> <p>She acknowledged that the religious setting is uncomfortable for some, but said her small class sizes and relaxed teaching style are attractive to many parents. The annual cost of tuition is around $6,000 for this academic year.</p> <p>Frilot said: \"It's a free place \u2013 they can come and be who they are. Its not robotic, not military-oriented.\"</p> <p>Many parents are drawn to the moral values she instils, Frilot said, as well as valuing her \"no-nonsense\" reputation. \"What they say is: if your child's having problems, take them to Miss Frilot.\"</p> <p>Religious education here takes the form of a Bible studies class rather than comparative faith, but science is never censored, Frilot said. \"We teach evolution, we teach reproduction. I'm not saying [religion] is the only way.\"</p> <p>Private schools that accept the vouchers must enter those students for the same standardised tests taken by public schools. If they fail to reach the bar set for state schools, they face removal from the programme.</p> <p>In Louisiana, the state sets clear limits on the marketplace. In the end, accountability to its testing regime trumps choice: the government will close a chronically underperforming public school even if parents continue to choose it.</p> <p>Neerav Kingsland, chief strategy officer of the not-for-profit group New Schools for New Orleans, likens it to licensing restaurants.</p> <p>\"If a restaurant is violating health codes, even if people want to go there, we're going to close the restaurant. If some schools are performing so bad on tests, even if parents want to got there it's a civic duty to close that option.\"</p> <p>Granting schools greater autonomy is regarded as vital to the health of the system. Freeing schools from central control \u2013 chiefly by setting up charters \u2013 has been a hallmark of education reform in the US, embraced by the leaders of both parties.</p> <p>With this freedom comes the latitude to tailor a bespoke approach to complex problems, White said.</p> <p>\"We have a school in the ninth ward where the principal has decided that he's going to serve breakfast, lunch and dinner to each child. He and I worked together in New York; we were joking about what would happen if we tried to do that in the New York City system.</p> <p>\"Not only would the teacher union say it was a violation of contract, but the food service would say: 'We don't do dinner'. Security would say: 'Yes, but we have to pay for the per diem', the electricity company would say: 'No, we shut school buildings down at this hour.' My point is that when you run systems on a basis where you have these monolithic contracts, they almost by their nature ignore the complexities of schools.\"</p> <p>In common with conservative education reforms across the US, New Orleans schools have come under increased competitive pressure while facing tight spending settlements.</p> <p>In particular, the Recovery School District \u2013 a group of underperforming Louisiana schools which have been taken over by the state government \u2013 is making \"significant cuts\" in expenditure, according to the Cowen Institute.</p> <p>Loup, of the Coalition for Louisiana Public Education, said: \"The money the state provides to our school system has not been increased in four years. That increase is what allows the school system to handle the increasing costs that we receive every year, for retirement, for healthcare, for the gas that goes on the bus. That's the biggest thing that's holding our school system back.</p> <p>\"Every time you take that money away, it's taking away programmes that help those who need it the most. It means the schools are not going to do well, they'll have lower scores, it makes us look like we're not doing our job.\"</p> <p>Even before Katrina, the quality of infrastructure in New Orleans was poor. Its roads, built on swampy ground and poorly maintained, are often bumpy and potholed. The officials behind its school reforms say one of their concerns is to deal with a gap the government can fix; the supply of skilled workers.</p> <p>Raising standards in schools means more jobs in sectors like oil and gas, a mainstay of the state's economy, can be filled by local people. Patrick Dobard, superintendent of the Recovery school district, said: \"As a state we have a number of chemical plants and what we're finding is that requirements in plant operators have changed dramatically over the last ten or 15 years, where you really need a couple of years of community college or two years of four-year college to perform at the level they need to have for workers, so there's a dire need in the industry to have higher performing workers.</p> <p>\"That's why we're trying to ensure we have strong technical education in our schools.\"</p> <p>The public school system in New Orleans remains skewed by race and income compared with the city it serves. In the academic year 2011-12, 90% of students in New Orleans public schools were African American and 85% were on free or reduced lunches, an indicator of poverty. The US census says 60% of the city population is black and 24% are classified as poor.</p> <h2>The US census says</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427479\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/26/1351268827268/Clark-Prep-charter-school-008.jpg\" alt=\"Clark Prep charter school in New Orleans\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clark Prep: formerly a 'school of last resort'. Photograph: Julie Dermansky for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Dermansky/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>Meanwhile, those at the forefront of change are often white, prompting accusations that this is a reform imposed by outsiders. Since the charter school programme was accelerated in the wake of Katrina, the profile of school staff has changed; it has become whiter and younger. White, the state superintendent, acknowledges the change \u2013 around half of school leaders are now white, he says. He said: \"Its not far from the demographic of the city itself which has also changed. It's over a third white.\"</p> <p>The concentration of African American children in New Orleans schools dates back to desegregation; white flight created entirely black schools in the inner city, and largely white ones in the suburbs. Joseph S Clark prepatory school \u2013 better known as Clark Prep \u2013 was, before desegregation, a highly performing black school.</p> <p>But when it was taken over by charter operator FirstLine Schools, it had become a \"school of last resort,\" according to co-principal Alex Hochron.</p> <p>He said: \"The year before FirstLine took over in 2010, Clark was the lowest-performing high school in the whole of Louisiana. When we walked in here, spray-painted up one of the banisters was the word 'graveyard'. [We said] did someone do this because we're taking over the school? The response was: that's been up there for months.</p> <p>\"There was very little authority. There were fires being set in the bathrooms. I'm not saying the adults weren't working, but there wasn't a sense of consistency and support.\"</p> <p>The change in two years is evident to the students, who come up unprompted to tell outsiders of their pride in the school. One student, Henrietta London, said: \"This school used to be a mess; children were learning nothing. My mum sent me here because they're rebuilding the school and changing the culture.\"</p> <p>The school ran a poster campaign this year aimed at recruiting new parents. One poster showed faces from the class of 2012, highlighting how many had been accepted into college. Another featured a star student in his basketball gear, asking: \"What will be your legacy?\"</p> <p>Jay Altman, chief executive of FirstLine Schools, dismisses the idea that the competition for students discourages schools from sharing knowledge.</p> <p>\"Even though hospitals in this country are competing with each other and patients have relative choice, medicine has some of the best knowledge sharing in the world,\" he pointed out. \"Those of us who are trying to close the [education] achievement gap nationally, we share practices all the time.\"</p> <p>The future in Louisiana is one in which the competitive pressures will only get more intense. The state estimates that 380,000 schoolchildren, out of 700,000 statewide, are eligible for the voucher scheme. Charter schools, introduced in many other cities as competition to traditional public schools, are themselves facing the prospect of pupils being poached.</p> <p>The language of the marketplace pervades the conversation about schools here. When the architects of school reform in Louisiana speak about the public school system, it is reminiscent of a private equity firm casting a hawkish eye over a mediocre business they have just bought.</p> <p>White is uncompromising about the virtues of choice, even if that means weak schools being driven to the wall. \"I think competition is always to some degree destabilising to those who can't compete,\" he said. \"I have no problem with a school that is failing parents and kids being essentially destabilised because parents aren't choosing it.\"'</p>",
  "<p>China is the world's biggest market but for western media firms trying to expand it can be a bruising experience, with even the biggest names such as Rupert Murdoch and Google having come a cropper.</p> <p>So it was perhaps inevitable when the New York Times (NYT) decided to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/28/new-york-times-launches-chinese-website\" title=\"\">launch a Chinese language website in June</a> that it would at some point fall foul of the censors. But it did so in spectacular fashion on Friday when the government blocked access to the site, accusing it of trying to \"smear\" the country's name. Its crime was to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/new-york-times-china-wen-jiabao\" title=\"\">publish an article</a> claiming that the family of the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, had accumulated massive wealth \u2013 a handsome $2.7bn (\u00a31.67bn) \u2013 during his time in power.</p> <p>China swiftly blocked access to the paper's websites and censored searches for the NYT as well as the names of Wen's children and wife on China's main Twitter-like microblogging service, Weibo.</p> <p>A foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said the paper \"smears China's name and has ulterior motives\".</p> <p>The media group responded by saying it would \"ask the Chinese authorities to ensure that our readers in China can continue to enjoy New York Times journalism\".</p> <p>The NYT hired 30 staff for its Chinese website, most of whom are working as translators and editors, and publishes about 30 articles a day on national, foreign and arts topics, in addition to editorials. Two thirds of the content is translated from the paper and a third is written by Chinese editors and local freelance journalists.</p> <p>The US paper was unlikely to follow Google's initial approach when it launched in 2006 and censor its content but diplomacy would be needed to re-establish its service, said William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the Oxford Internet Institute.</p> <p>\"It will be impossible for China to stop people seeing this story even by censoring the site because there will be so much re-posting of the story from elsewhere. So I don't think censorship can be totally effective.

  "<p>There's something about Santi Cazorla. He has a strange effect on people. Mention him and there it is: the wide eyes, the enthusiasm, the enjoyment, the sense of discovery, the fun. From Ruud van Nistelrooy escaping the sun at M\u00e1laga's training ground and offering a judgment of unsolicited simplicity, to Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez citing him as the embodiment of a footballing manifesto that has conquered all, there is something about him that brings out the fan in footballers. And in football managers.</p> <p>\"What a player Santi is,\" said Van Nistelrooy puffing out his cheeks early last season, just weeks after becoming his team-mate for the first time. Xavi, signalling his chest, said: \"Have you seen Santi Cazorla? You think I'm small? He's up to here on me and he's brilliant.\" Neither man was asked to talk about Cazorla; both men, team-mates of his, chose to. As for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, he called on every kid in the country to watch Cazorla play. And it was not just what he said that stood out as the way he said it. The look on his face.</p> <p>Every time Arsenal's manager has mentioned Cazorla since he signed from M\u00e1laga for \u20ac15m (\u00a312m) there has been a childlike quality to his response. A giggling guilt: how did we get him? And for that price? A price that M\u00e1laga's coach, Manuel Pellegrini, this week called \"an unthinkable gift\". M\u00e1laga's financial crisis provides part of the answer; the passivity of other clubs, though, remains a mystery because, however much Cazorla is touted as an unknown revelation, he is nothing of the sort.</p> <p>The surprise is not that he is playing well \u2013 former team-mates say that they never had any doubts \u2013 but that, at 27, it has taken this long for him to be universally recognised. So far this season he has created more chances from open play than anyone else in England. It is not new: last season he created 82 goalscoring chances; only behind Lionel Messi, Mesut Ozil and Jes\u00fas Navas. The year before that, Opta put together a statistics-driven perfect XI of La Liga players: Cazorla and Juan Mata were the only non-Madrid or Barcelona players in it.</p> <p>\"When we signed him last summer, he symbolised us crossing from a good team to a great one. He is a player who plays and makes others play, supremely gifted. An artist,\" says the former M\u00e1laga sporting director Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez, whose job it was, fleetingly, to lead the first big money project in the country.</p> <p>Fifty caps for Spain \u2013 <em>this Spain</em> \u2013 say much, and Cazorla played a key role in winning Euro 2008, but he missed the 2010 World Cup through injury. The inevitable question runs: if he is so good, why did Madrid or Barcelona never sign him? The short answer is: they are Real Madrid and Barcelona. And Madrid tried. Twice.</p> <p>In 2008 Cazorla was caught by TV cameras talking on the phone to Iker Casillas about his imminent move to Madrid, but Villarreal moved to block the transfer. And this week Pellegrini, his coach at first Villarreal and then M\u00e1laga, told Gazetta dello Sport that he had tried to sign him for Madrid the following season.</p> <p>\"He has the talent to play for either of those two but when the situation arose, Villarreal made an effort to keep him and he wanted to show his gratitude to them after all they had done,\" explains Carlos Marchena, a team-mate with Villarreal and Spain.</p> <p>\"I could never understand why Madrid or Barcelona never signed him,\" says Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral, his coach at Recreativo de Huelva. \"It is hard to explain and it also makes me a bit sad. I think it's a real pity for the Spanish league.\"</p> <p>Those who knew Cazorla knew. \"Anyone who has played with him knew that everyone in England would fall in love with him,\" Marchena says. Joan Capdevila, Cazorla's room mate at Villarreal, adds: \"He does things you've never seen. You want to know how good Santi is? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ack6SJG5ThM&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">Type 'Cazorla, Seitaridis' into YouTube</a>.\"</p> <p>The video is almost six years old, from the time that Cazorla spent at Recreativo de Huelva aged 21 to 22, a single-season hiatus in his seven years at Villarreal. In it, he flicks the ball from one foot to the other and through the legs of the Greek defender. It happens so fast you have to watch it again to appreciate the skill. And the problem, Capdevila says, is that few even watched it the first time: \"If he had done that in the Champions League it would have gone round the world.\"</p> <p>The technique is natural. Watch the Spanish national team do piggy-in-the-middle drills and you can see it. The ball whizzes round so fast, so precisely, that even very good players, world champions, can be made to look average. Cazorla is emphatically not one of them. Sit close and the speed can be dizzying. Cazorla barely flinches. Pass, pass, pass, right foot, left. \"I played with him for five years and I still don't know if he is right footed or left footed, even from corners and free-kicks: it's insane,\" Capdevila says.</p> <p>Marcos L\u00f3pez is a coach in Oviedo who remembers being struck by an eight-year-old playing five-a-side <em>futbol sala</em> for a team called Covadonga. A team of kids from the neighbourhood, they were in the same division as clubs with long histories like Astur, Sporting Gijon, Real Oviedo and Estadio, where Juan Mata would later play. Still they won their group. \"By the end of the season they could easily have scored 300 and conceded 20,\" L\u00f3pez says. \"Santi was very, very small but he was dynamic, could dribble and controlled games. He left everyone open mouthed.\"</p> <p>Real Oviedo picked him up. Among his coaches was Luis S\u00e1nchez. \"Santi stood out immediately, not least because he was tiny,\" he says. \"These days everyone plays on Astroturf but back then all the pitches were muddy and he looked so small. But although there were inevitable question marks I never feared that size was going to be a problem. He could already kick a ball wonderfully with both feet, technically he was miles better than everyone else: he was prodigious. He could go past you on either side, and he was the top scorer by miles. He was dynamic, different. His talent is innate. And besides, he got stronger: he looks little now, but he is tough.\"</p> <p>From Oviedo, Cazorla joined Villarreal at 15. But it was the year at Recreativo that made him. \"You could see even then that he had all the qualities to be world class,\" says Javi Guerrero, who played with Cazorla there. \"He was absolutely clear about where he wanted to go and we knew he would get there. He was two footed, even taking corners from both sides and both feet, swinging in or swinging out. I remember being impressed by that but what was most striking was how daring he was for a player so young.\"</p> <p>The word Guerrero uses is <em>desparpajo.</em> It's a word many employ to describe Cazorla, one that could almost be translated as cheek. And watching the video Capdevila recommends, it is easy to see why. Yet there is also something eminently sensible and calm about his game. <em>Listo</em>, smart, is another recurring word. He controls the pace, the fluidity. In fact, Marcos Senna sees him as a potential long-term replacement for Xavi in the Spain team.</p> <p>Recreativo's manager Marcelino says: \"I had first seen him as a kid playing in Asturias but I'd lost track of him. When Recre signed him, we quickly realised that he was special. He was extremely clever.\" \"He reads the game so well,\" says Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez. \"His movement with and without the ball is exceptional and his always takes the right decision. He improves those around him, playing for them not just himself.\"</p> <p>\"Santi is always available: he never, ever hides,\" says Capdevila. \"He is a real leader. Not in the sense of shouting at people: he is not aggressive, he doesn't confront the referee, but he is a winner. He's extremely stubborn and very determined. Even off the pitch: even when we play cards or on the PlayStation, he always wants to win.\" Capdevila talks from experience: Cazorla jokes that the \"one time\" Capdevila beat him, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/11/santi-cazorla-small-talk-interview\" title=\"\">he took a photo of the screen as proof to show his team-mates </a>.</p> <p>\"I have watched him closely on the pitch for a long time and one of the things I don't think people see is that capacity to suffer, to read the game and know how to adapt: when to be practical, when to be expansive,\" Marchena says. \"He is also always there for you, in all games, injured or not. His commitment, for someone so talented, is extremely unusual. For weaker players, sure. But not for someone like him.\"</p> <p>\"Players who think they have got it all tend to stagnate but Santi was never like that,\" Marcelino says. \"He was straightforward, noble, very mature, humble. You didn't have to tell him much but when you did he listened and took it all on board. One of his greatest virtues was that he loves football. He watched every game, he was humble, he listened, and he wanted to win. He was a <em>f\u00fatbolista futbolero.\"</em></p> <p>Guerrero explains that description: \"He watched every game, read everything he could. He really lived the game.\" Friends recall him as a 10-year-old playing his own games before heading off to watch his brother play, a football always at his feet. \"With Santi it was football, football, football,\" Luis S\u00e1nchez says. \"He has changed a bit though. Back then he hardly talked. I still see him occasionally and now he is a joker.\"</p> <p>Cazorla's smile is part of his charm. \"He tells the worst jokes ever,\" says Capdevila and Capdevila knows a thing about telling rubbish jokes. \"His are worse \u2013 and he doesn't even know how to tell them properly. I laughed every single day with him.\" Marchena says: \"He is a great team-mate, good in the dressing room: he never has a bad word for anyone, he is always smiling, always willing to help you out.\" To put that in sporting director terms, M\u00e1laga's Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez says: \"He creates an environment conducive to success.\" The text message response from one player responding to a request to talk about Cazorla sums it up: \"For Santi, anything.\"</p> <p>When Cazorla left Villarreal, Senna said he felt like the team had cut off a finger. They had qualified for the Champions League in his last season; in their first without him, they went down. Senna explains: \"When Santi left, it left a huge hole. Both on the pitch and off it. If he had been there I am sure we would not have gone down. He is a player who never loses the ball. He's so complete: he knows when to pause, when to accelerate; he imposed a style and dynamism on the team. He interprets the game so well. And without him, we lost our identity, our way of playing.\"</p> <p>Marchena agrees: \"His departure was one of the main reasons that we struggled.\"</p> <p>While Villarreal went down, Cazorla's new club, M\u00e1laga qualified for the Champions League for the first time in their history. And, when financial crisis hit, he left them too. Wenger was ready to take advantage. The perfect player, perfectly suited to his new environment.</p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez says: \"The other thing to take into account is that his style is perfect for Arsenal. He suits a team that wants to have the ball; he facilitates that approach.\" Senna says: \"If it had been any other club, I am sure his adaptation would have taken longer but Arsenal play his way, similar to Spanish teams, so I am not remotely surprised that he has been so successful.\"</p> <p>Wenger's definition sums it up: it is not just about creativity but about control. \"He opens defences with the quality of his passing and he gives us a technical security that allows us to escape when we are under pressure. He can make us stronger and more efficient,\" Wenger says. There is, Capdevila says, just one problem: the language. \"I want to see his first interview in English. Now, that is going to be a video worth watching.\"</p>",

Now Malala Yousafzai, the 15-year-old who was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/09/taliban-pakistan-shoot-girl-malala-yousafzai\" title=\"\">shot in the head by the Taliban</a> for daring to want to go to school, could provide a turning point in Pakistan's history, according to her father.</p> <p>Ziauddin Yousafzai, speaking after arriving in Britain to visit Malala with his wife and two sons, said his daughter would not be beaten by the Taliban but would \"rise again\".</p> <p>Clearly moved by the support his family and daughter have received, he said the attack, in which Malala was shot by a Pakistan Taliban gunman while making her way home on a school bus, had united his nation in approbation.</p> <p>\"When she fell, Pakistan stood and the world rose,\" Yousafzai told a press conference in Birmingham, where his daughter is being treated after being flown to the UK from Pakistan. \"This is a turning point. In Pakistan, for the first time, all political parties, Urdus, Christians, Sikhs, all religions prayed for my daughter.\" He added: \"She is not just my daughter, she is everybody's daughter.\"</p> <p>He <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/26/malala-yousafzai-father-video\" title=\"\">thanked all those who supported her cause of \"peace and education\" (video)</a> and condemned the violence that had been inflicted upon her.</p> <p>\"An attacker, who could be called the agent of Satan, he attacked,\" he said. \"But after that I found angels on my side, everywhere, all around me, until this time and this place&#xa0;[\u2026] I'm thankful to all the people all over the world. They condemned the attack and prayed for my daughter.\"</p> <p>Malala had gained global influence and respect since starting a blog documenting her desire to get an education in her home city of Mingora in the Swat Valley. She wrote compellingly for the BBC about the daily struggles of getting an education in a region where the Taliban has occasionally banned girls from attending school. Gradually she became a more public figure, promoting education for girls in interviews and advising local authorities on education.</p> <p>But her own schooling was violently interrupted on 9 October: she was shot at point blank range and two other girls were injured in the attack which the Taliban said was punishment for \"promoting secularism\".</p> <p>The bullet hit her just above the back of her left eye and came within inches of killing her. But as her father put it: \"When she fell, the person who attacked her wanted to kill her&#xa0;\u2026 She fell temporarily, she will rise again, she will stand again. She can stand now.\"</p> <p>Immediately after the attack surgeons in Pakistan battled to save the teenager's life, performing an emergency operation to remove a bullet lodged in her neck. But with the threat of further retribution hanging over the family, the decision was taken to airlift Malala to Britain, where it was hoped she could recover in peace.</p> <p>Her father spoke of the joy of seeing his daughter alive again when they were reunited this week at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham.</p> <p>The reunion was particularly emotional, he explained, because the family had started to mentally prepare themselves for her funeral. \"A time came&#xa0;\u2026 when, God forbid, I told my brother that you should make preparations for her funeral,\" he said. \"To be very short, I can say that she got the right treatment, at the right place, at the right time.\" He added: \"I love her. Last night when we met her there were tears in our eyes out of happiness. For some time we all cried a bit.\"</p> <p>Yousafzai paid special tribute to Dr David Rosser, who is treating Malala, and thanked him for keeping the lines of communication between the UK and Pakistan open since Malala was transferred.</p> <p>Rosser said Malala was continuing to make good progress and was now able to eat, talk and walk with only a little help. He added that her short and long-term memory seemed to be fine. \"We're very much in a phase of her care that is about her recovery, both physical and psychological,\" he said. \"She's very tired but she managed a big smile for her mum and dad and her brothers.\"</p> <p>Since the attack Malala has been nominated for the International Children's peace prize by Desmond Tutu and has won Pakistan's first National Youth peace prize. Despite promises from the Taliban to kill Malala if she goes back to Pakistan, Yousafzai insisted the family would return home: Malala has already started preparing for her exams.</p>",
  "<p>So many stories of employers pressuring their workers to vote for Romney have come out that you might think workplace intimidation was invented just for this election.</p> <p>Romney certainly hasn't done much to dispel this perception. In a conference call to the National Federation of Independent Business, the GOP candidate was <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/10/romney-told-employers-tell-employees-whom-vote/58076/\">recorded encouraging business owners</a> to:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[M]ake it very clear to your employees what you believe is in the best interest of your enterprise and therefore their job and their future in the upcoming elections.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A number of Romney backers took it upon themselves to spell out more clearly to their workers what \"the best interest for their job\" really means. David Siegel, CEO of Florida's Westgate Resorts, <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5950189/the-ceo-who-built-himself-americas-largest-house-just-threatened-to-fire-his-employees-if-obamas-elected\">emailed</a> his employees that a second term for Obama would likely give him \"no choice but to reduce the size of this company\". Republican donor-activists Charles and David Koch were no less subtle when they sent 45,000 employees of their Georgia Pacific paper company a list of whom to vote for, warning that workers \"<a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/14017/koch_industries_sends_45000_employees_pro_romney_mailing\">may suffer the consequences</a>\" if Obama is re-elected.</p> <p>Florida-based ASG Software CEO Arthur Allen informed his employees that he was contemplating a merger that would eliminate \"<a href=\"http://tv.msnbc.com/2012/10/14/exclusive-ceo-suggests-employees-jobs-may-be-at-stake-if-romney-doesnt-win/\">60% of the salaries</a>\" of the company \u2013 should Romney lose. In Ohio, coal mine owner Robert Murray <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/108140/coal-miners-donor-mitt-romney-benefactor\">left employees in no doubt that they were expected to attend a Romney rally</a> \u2013 off the clock and without pay. In Cuba, at least they pay workers for show demonstrations.</p> <p>Democrats are apoplectic. But as Romney assured those who have the power to hire and fire thousands of people, there is \"nothing illegal about you talking to your employees about what you believe is best for the business\". He's right. Heavy-handed? Yes. An abuse of authority? Probably. Against the law? Not likely.</p> <p>News outlets, on the other hand, are merely confused.</p> <p>\"Can your boss really tell you who to vote for?\" <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/can-your-boss-threaten-to-fire-you-if-you-dont-vote-for-romney/263709/\">asked</a> the Atlantic incredulously, before concluding the answer is \"probably yes\". Should this be a surprise? Seeing that your boss can legally tell you to do nearly anything else, down to what you may wear, when you may eat and how often you may go to the bathroom (and, if he wishes, demand samples when you do), the question comes across as a little na\u00efve. So, too, is the <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/elections/campaign-trail/you-can-get-fired-talking-politics-work\">corollary</a> \"Can you be fired for expressing political views at work?\" Again, the answer is probably yes, which should only be a shock to anyone who has never held a job in an American private-sector workplace.</p> <p>In truth, as an \"at-will\" (that is, non-union) employee, you can be fired for much less. In Arizona, you can be fired for <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/ariz-birth-control-bill-lets-employers-fire-women-pill-based-religious-views-425530\">using birth control</a>. If you live in any one of 29 states, you can be fired for <a href=\"http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/5-people-who-were-fired-for-being-gay-and-the-29-states-where-that-is-still-legal/\">being gay</a>. You can be fired for <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/expresident/really-weird-reasons-for-getting-fired\">being a fan of the Green Bay Packers</a> if your boss roots for the Bears.</p> <p>Lest you think employer authority ends when you clock out, only four states \u2013 California, Colorado, New York and North Dakota \u2013 protect workers from being fired for legal activity <em>outside of work</em>. For the rest, workers can and <a href=\"http://crookedtimber.org/2012/07/01/let-it-bleed-libertarianism-and-the-workplace/\">have been fired for anything</a> from smoking to cross-dressing, all in the privacy of their homes. The growing practice of employers demanding job applicants to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2122404/House-kills-plan-block-employers-demanding-Facebook-passwords-job-applicants.html\">hand over their Facebook passwords</a> underscores the blurring of the work-life divide in this information age.</p> <p>But free speech and voting rights are supposed to be more sacrosanct than the integrity of your Facebook account, so one would expect there to be greater political safeguards at work than there actually are. This is not to say they don't exist. Federal law makes it illegal to \"intimidate, threaten or coerce\" anyone against voting as they wish. But as Siegel, Allen and the Koch brothers have shown, the distinction between possible coercion or intimidation and \"worker education\" is rather fuzzy in the eyes of the law.</p> <p>Rather, the federal government largely punted questions of employee free speech to states, a legacy of federalism that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws\">hasn't had the best track record</a> when it comes to voting rights. In a state-by-state breakdown, UCLA law professor <a href=\"http://www.trolp.org/main_pgs/issues/v16n2/Volokh.pdf\">Eugene Volokh</a> finds such laws vary widely. About half of Americans live in states that provide some worker protection for political speech or from pressure to vote a certain way, such as threat of job loss. Florida is not one of them. Ohio bars employers from forcing workers to sign a petition, but not from <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/08/ohio-miners-required-attend-romney-rally\">standing in front of cameras</a> next to a \"Coal Country Stands With Mitt\" banner.</p> <p>Of course, what's on the books is one matter; enforcement is another. Even if you are lucky enough to live in New Mexico and have a signed letter saying you were fired for your Obama tote bag, it typically takes litigation to get your job back. And many people don't have the time or money to go through a court battle, even if the law is on their side.</p> <p>If anything is happening on the legal end, things are getting worse. The 2010 US supreme court Citizens United case greatly expanded the parameters of what is considered \"employer free speech\". Most famously, the decision lifted restrictions on corporate campaign spending and gave rise to Super Pacs. But the broader implications are unclear. If Citizens United gives companies free rein to mobilize their resources politically as they wish, one former FEC official <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/58_32/Workplace-Intimidation-Becomes-Murky-Post-Citizens-United-Era-218456-1.html\">suggests</a> that employees could be considered resources which companies may mobilize.</p> <p>This is why the recent political turn of employee intimidation isn't an anomaly. It's an election year manifestation \u2013 aided by the supreme court \u2013 of fundamental power imbalances that exist in most workplaces. Brooklyn College political scientist Corey Robin sees a historical pattern: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"During the McCarthy years, the state outsourced the most significant forms of coercion and repression to the workplace. Fewer than 200 people went to jail for their political beliefs, but two out of every five American workers was investigated or subject to surveillance. </p> <p>\"Today, we're seeing a similar process of outsourcing.

We have that in Anglo American in a big way,\" she said.</p> <p>When she became chief executive in March 2007, Carroll was the first non-South African, the first woman and the first outsider to take the reins at the company. She will stay on until a successor is found, which could take up to nine months.</p> <p>Potential successors include Alex Vanselow, the Brazilian former chief financial officer of BHP Billiton and Aaron Regent, the former boss of Barrick Gold. Anglo's chairman, Sir John Parker, said the company would conduct a global search but \"could not afford\" Mick Davis, who is planning to leave Xstrata.</p> <p>Carroll's communication skills had been questioned by shareholders who were also concerned about the miner's share performance and Anglo's exposure to South Africa, where a series of mining disputes have hit output.</p> <p>One of Anglo's largest shareholders, South Africa's Public Investment Corporation, said the company had missed opportunities in Africa and criticised Carroll's \"poor decision making\". It called for a swift replacement.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/05/anglo-american-sacks-south-african-miners?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Anglo American Platinum, a subsidiary and the world's biggest platinum producer, sacked 12,000 South African workers</a> in early October after three weeks of strikes. The company is also faced with cost overruns at the Minas-Rio iron ore project in Brazila and a legal battle with Codelco, Chile's state-owned miner.</p> <p>Dismissing suggestions that Carroll had been forced out by shareholders, Parker said her decision to leave was her own as she started her seventh year in a \"very gruelling and demanding role\".</p> <p>Cailey Barker, an analyst at Numis, said: \"Given the challenges and pressures to the business it may not come as a surprise to some, but we believe overall she has done a good job of transforming the company since taking the helm in 2007.\"</p> <p>Despite drastic cost cuts that resulted in 26,000 job losses to streamline a sprawling consortium, analysts at Macquarie calculated Anglo had lost a third of its value since Carroll took the helm, while its peers are worth at least the same as in 2007.</p> <p>Carroll took home more than \u00a32m in salary and bonuses in 2011, plus a payout of \u00a3445,000 from share-based bonus plans that vested during the year.

  "<p>The notional \"end of history\" proclaimed by Francis Fukuyama in 1989 was easily debunked, but not so easily broken with. As early as 1993, <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/misha-glenny\" title=\"\">Misha Glenny </a>titled a book on post-Soviet nationalism <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/politics/9780140172867/the-rebirth-of-history-eastern-europe-in-the-age-of-democracy\" title=\"\"><em>The Rebirth of History</em></a>, as if all that was left of the concept was religious and ethnic grievance. History as a force for futurity, the history that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/seumasmilne\" title=\"\">Seumas Milne</a> favourite Fidel Castro once claimed would absolve him, has taken far longer to return. <em>The Revenge of History</em>, an anthology of Guardian columns and articles from 1997 to 2012, optimistically argues that the last decade has seen its resurgence. Yet it shares its title with an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/politics/9780745608488/the-revenge-of-history-marxism-and-the-east-european-revolutions\" title=\"\">Alex Callinicos book</a> of 1991, which was hardly followed by years of leftwing advance. Will Milne's predictions turn out to be more accurate?</p> <p>Although Milne's sympathies are more often with the Labour left than with anarchists or Trotskyists, it's not hard to see why he infuriates many on the centre and right. The political tradition he comes from could broadly be described as communist, albeit in the softly-softly Cuban or Italian sense \u2013 and he evidently sees no reason to reject entirely everything about that heritage. As a Comment editor at the Guardian he earned much bile and some appreciation from opponents (such as hard-right Tory MEP <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-hannan\" title=\"\">Daniel Hannan</a>, who magnanimously called him a \"sincere, eloquent and uncomplicated Marxist\"). But outside of the inflammatory, instantly forgotten controversies of the political press, Milne is probably best known for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/politics/9781844675081/the-enemy-within-thatchers-secret-war-against-the-miners\" title=\"\"><em>The Enemy Within</em></a>, a 1994 expos\u00e9 of MI5's covert campaign against the National Union of Mineworkers. The collusions it revealed between Thatcher, the secret services, the police and the tabloids meant that its readers wouldn't have been at all surprised by the recent revelations over phone-hacking and Hillsborough. The scope of this belated next book moves from one strike to the entirety of post-9/11 world history, with chapters on liberal interventionism and the war on terror, the rise of neoliberalism and its 2008 bankruptcy, the prospects of \"21st-century socialism\" and the contemporary Arab revolt.</p> <p>Accordingly, there's little room for <em>The Enemy Within</em>'s thriller-like construction in <em>The Revenge of History</em>. It is a collection of columns, with minimal editing; their force and immediacy in small doses produces a numbing effect if read consecutively. Not only is there repetition between the columns themselves, the new editorial interventions \u2013 a Preface and italicised introductory paragraphs to each section \u2013 are themselves repetitious, with cut-and-pasted sentences from the Preface returning verbatim later in the book to introduce each chapter. Milne's style, so poised through <em>The Enemy Within</em>, is here crammed into tight word counts, and shows rather too much fondness for \"clarion calls\", \"siren songs\", and other expressions only ever used by political commentators. Perhaps this format is dictated by the book's persistent, if entirely forgiveable undercurrent of \"I told you so!\"</p> <p>Milne has a knack for making arguments which when published are excoriated as unforgivable, and which then gradually become guiltily commonsensical. Never obviously bothered by tact, Milne could publish a column a couple of days after 9/11 bemoaning that those in the US asking why the attacks occurred \"still don't get it\". Similarly unpopular and similarly vindicated were his articles insisting that resistance in Iraq and Afghanistan would be ferocious, that PFI would be ruinously expensive and inefficient, that the \"end to boom and bust\" was illusory, and that the riots of 2011 were largely a rational, political act. But politically, \"winning arguments\" is not enough, and Milne knows it.</p> <p>Another argumentative approach which appears to infuriate is an insistence on seeing current events in a global and historical perspective, or \"whataboutery\", as it's known. He likes to ask why authoritarian regimes in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are supported by western governments and those in Zimbabwe and Cuba are not, to ask why Stalin is culpable for the famine of 1933 and Churchill not for that of 1943, to ask why Leopold II's victims are forgotten and Mao's commemorated. All political traditions, he insists, have blood on their hands, and liberalism is certainly no exception.</p> <p>Milne's opinions are more complex than caricature might imply. The earliest piece here, a 1997 post-election profile of New Labour, shows him willing to settle for at least a tolerably reforming government \u2013 and given his partial optimism, it is unusual in this collection for not being vindicated by events. It does, however, boast the revelation that in 1997, Blair was privately comparing himself with De Gaulle \u2013 as only the great war hero could withdraw French troops from Algeria, only his Labour government would be able to truly dismantle the benefits system. The strong line taken here on Israel goes alongside a dismissal of the notion of an \"Israel lobby\" that supposedly bends US policy to its will. Milne's somewhat vague, ambiguous view of the Soviet Union means at least that he is one of the rare western journalists to have dared to point out how anti-communism in contemporary Europe often spills over into direct rehabilitation of domestic fascists and even, in Latvia and Lithuania, Holocaust perpetrators. Although slandered by the usual internet suspects as an \"antisemite\", he's been one of the few to expose this polite, Council of Europe-sanctioned form of Holocaust revisionism.</p> <p>The real interest of the book, as its title implies, is in the prospects it holds for a revitalised left. He sees hope both in workers' strikes in China and in its mixed economy; in the nationalisations of the Latin American \"pink tide\" and in Occupy Wall Street; in a \"multipolar world\" where the US can no longer act with impunity. Eventually, however, he argues that a movement against neoliberalism will produce its own political form, one which we won't anticipate. Its policies will be an \"ideologically driven improvisation\" rather than a predetermined blueprint. It will, he insists, emerge \"sooner or later\". We can only hope history bears that out.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Hatherley's <em>A New Kind of Bleak</em> is published by Verso.</p>",

It took place as the ceasefire called to mark the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha was already faltering in parts of the country, with regime forces and rebel groups blaming each other for the violations.</p> <p>Car bombs have been increasingly used by rebel groups, including the Islamist Jabhat al-Nusraf organisation, which has some ideological links to the global jihad movement. However, such groups have largely targeted security bases.</p> <p>This bomb hit Daff al-Shouk square, where families were celebrating Eid, on the southern outskirts of the capital. No group had claimed responsibility for the blast by nightfall.</p> <p>Earlier, the truce brokered by the UN-Arab League peace envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, had done little to stem the violence in parts of Syria, including parts of Damascus and ravaged districts of Aleppo.</p> <p>The Local Co-ordination Committees, which monitor violence daily, reported 110 breaches of the truce and around 48 deaths, a toll that is sharply down on any other day in recent months. Other areas of the country, such as the cities of Homs and Hama, were quieter than in recent months. Activists there reported that families had taken to the streets of some neighbourhoods to celebrate one of the holiest occasions in the Islamic calendar.</p> <p>In Aleppo, the centre of violence since rebels stormed the city in mid-July, gains made by opposition fighters in three districts on Thursday were partially clawed back by the army. Rebels had moved into the districts, reporting little resistance from a Kurdish militia in one of the areas and Syrian troops in two others. Little ground had previously changed hands in Aleppo despite more than two months of fighting. Syrian forces retain control of much of the west of the city and strategic points on the outskirts, such as the airport. However, they remain unable to secure the east of the city, despite near constant aerial bombardment of rebels in some districts.</p> <p>On Thursday Turkey denied a Human Rights Watch claim that it was preventing thousands of Syrian refugees from crossing into its territory. Turkey is hosting about 103,000 Syrian refugees and says it expects thousands more as winter closes in. Refugee groups claim some of those fleeing have been unable to cross from Syria since late August. Lebanon and Jordan are sheltering similar numbers to Turkey. All three states say they are under-prepared for an expected influx in the last weeks of autumn.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch senior refugee researcher Gerry Simpson said: \" General assurances [from Turkey] alone will not open borders. Thousands of desperate Syrians remain stuck inside Syria on the Turkish and Iraqi borders amidst mounting insecurity and with winter fast approaching.</p> <p>\"Human Rights Watch calls on the UN refugee agency to report publicly on which border crossings are closed and how many Syrians are stuck inside Syria as a result.\"</p>",
  "<p>This week brought more bad news for hockey fans in a very bad news autumn. Thursday marked the deadline imposed by the NHL after which a full-length, 82-game season would not be possible. That deadline also meant the NHL withdrew its latest offer to the NHL Players' Association. Now, the league and the players remain at an impasse, and there are questions surrounding both how long a potential season might be, and whether fans will be denied experiencing the Winter Classic because of a protracted season. That is, if there is any NHL season at all. On Friday the season was postponed until 30 November - at the earliest.</p> <h2>The deals</h2> <p>About a week ago, the NHL put forward another deal to the NHLPA, a number of whose members are already off in Europe, playing away from increasingly frustrated North American eyes. It was the first time a proposal had been introduced since mid-September, and this time for some reason, the NHL decided to make it public. Anyway, it went something like this (broadly speaking): </p> <p>Taking after some of the other major leagues out there (and yes, the NHL still considers itself in that group), there would be a 50-50 split of hockey-related revenue (HRR) for each of the six years of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. It's worth remembering that at the end of the last deal, the players' cut of HRR was 57%, so that's a fairly considerable drop, and not one that the players were ultimately willing to accept \u2013 at the moment. </p> <p>The league also offered that players only have a maximum contract length of five years, bringing it down from, well, the basically unlimited number of years a player can sign for now. The NHL also proposed to make entry-level deals shorter, and it also stipulated that free agency would only happen after age 28, or after the player had been in the league for eight years. </p> <p>During a press conference, league commissioner <a href=\"http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=643558\">Gary Bettman said the offer was put forward to try to ward off the loss of a full 82-game season, and that he believed it to be fair</a>.</p> <p>In response, the NHLPA gave the league three different proposals. In one, the players offered to take a raise in the first three years of a new deal, and then from then on have their wages frozen until their share of HRR was at 50%. The second offer was a variation on that, stipulating that the players would get 24.7% of new revenues every year as their share of HRR fell every year until it hit 50%.</p> <p>The third offer from the NHLPA is a little more complicated. <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/the-nhlpas-three-counter-proposals/article4622583/\">Here's how the Globe and Mail explained it</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Players propose here that 13 per cent of revenues would not count toward the players' share or the salary cap and are instead used to pay existing contracts. The remaining 87 per cent is then distributed among players as part of a 50-50 sharing of that remaining revenue. The NHLPA indicated this option would involve both sides receiving a 50-per-cent share by Year 5 but that was disputed by the league in a press release.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Anyway, it seems the real problem was that the NHLPA wanted the league to still honour all the contracts the teams had already signed. Bettman said \"none of the three variations of player share that they gave us even began to approach [a] 50-50 [revenue split],\" <a href=\"http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=407649\">he told the Canadian Press</a>. \"It's clear we're not speaking the same language.\"</p> <p>So here we are. Something major will have to happen to get these sides to agree, and that major happening will likely have to center on the 50-50 split. Likely, the league will have to give in a bit and allow for a gradual climb-down, rather than slashing away at the HRR split as it stands now. But how long will that take? And how long will the players be willing to hold out? Is it really about wanting to play? </p> <p>Finally, what of the Winter Classic? There's probably still a bit of time to save it, but if the league starts cutting the season in huge swaths, things like the Winter Classic and the All Star Game will be ever more in jeopardy (the All Star Game already is, really) to fit in a compacted schedule. That would be a shame, but at this point most fans would likely rather just see hockey again than worry too much about something like the Winter Classic. After all, there always next year. Theoretically.</p> <h2>The politics of it</h2> <p>In a weird little twist to this story, on Wednesday night, Jay Leno asked Barack Obama about the dispute on the Tonight Show. A \"Mike\" from Los Angeles asked whether Obama could \"pull some strings to end the NHL lockout\". The president responded:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do have a comment on this. Every time these things happen, I just want to remind the owners and the players: you guys make money because you got a whole bunch of fans out there, who are working really hard, they buy tickets, they're watching on TV \u2013 y'all should be able to figure this out. Get this done.</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dG0TzlA1oGA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dG0TzlA1oGA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Meanwhile, the team over at <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5951872/inside-a-secret-nhl-focus-group-how-a-top-gop-strategist-is-helping-hockey-owners-craft-their-lockout-propaganda\">Deadspin got their hands on documents</a> distributed at a focus group arranged by the NHL to test its messaging strategy, apparently settling on \"shared sacrifice\" as the winner. Behind it all? A Republican strategist. </p> <blockquote> <p>As the lockout claimed its first actual games, the NHL hurriedly turned to the experts on shaping public debate: Luntz Global, the multinational market research firm that proudly proclaims, \"It's not what you say, it's what they hear.\" CEO and founder Frank Luntz is one of the Republican Party's chief strategists, and he appears regularly on CBS and Fox News as an analyst. [...]</p> <p>The league is eager to portray individual players as not in step with the union, claiming that the majority of them don't believe or don't buy into the rhetoric used by Donald Fehr and NHLPA leaders, and that they just want to play hockey. \"The players are not the enemy,\" the NHL may very well tell you. \"The union is the problem.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Deadspin has the entire package the focus group members were handed, along with an account of how the focus group worked. Luntz responded to the story on Twitter, saying it was an \"attempt to discredit NHL efforts to reach agreement w/ players on new CBA\".</p> <h2><a href=\"http://leafsbeefs.com/\">Leafs Beefs</a> explains it all.

The <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/nhl-islanders-to-move-to-brooklyn-s-barclays-arena-ny-post-says.html\">Islanders ownership had been threatening to move the team for a while, and had the 2015 season marked off already, given the lease at the Nassau Coliseum was set to expire</a>.</p> <p>It seems to me the move is a double-edged sword. The relocation might be a shot in the arm to an organization that's been floundering of late, and might be yet another feather in Brooklyn's cap as it tries to (seemingly \u2013 from this vantage point, anyway) separate itself from simply being a part of \"New York\" and define itself as a city again. All of which is cool, and could make for a really interesting new chapter in the life of this team. </p> <p>But, then there are the questions of legacy. The Islanders have been at home on Long Island - and at the Coliseum - since 1972, and in that time brought home four Stanley Cups, so moving them will be tough for the locals who would have to travel an extra 45km or so to see the team play in Brooklyn. And no matter where the Islanders play, is there still room for this team in the New York area? Can both the Rangers and Islanders (and let's not forget the Devils) be successful in this market? Is there enough revenue possible? </p> <p>Having the Islanders closer to Manhattan might help rekindle that rivalry \u2013 especially since it'll now be one that's even more about a battle between boroughs, too. And could the size limitations on the Barclays Center help? The arena only has a 14,500 capacity for hockey games, putting it below even the Winnipeg Jets home rink, the MTS Centre, which sits at just 15,000. </p> <p>Oh, and as for the name and logo? They're staying, apparently.</p>",

Campaign groups believe the extreme weather of 2011 and 2012 \u2013 with hurricanes, heat waves, floods, droughts , wildfires in the US and the epic melting in the Arctic \u2013 are behind a sharp rise in the number of Americans who believe in global warming over the last two years.</p> <p>Some 70% of Americans believe in climate change, according to a <a href=\"http://environment.yale.edu/climate/files/Climate-Beliefs-September-2012.pdf\">Yale survey last month</a>, up 13% from 2010.</p> <p>As Sandy barrels in, climate messaging firms and campaign groups are putting out primers on the connections between climate change and extreme weather, and the rising costs over the last few years of dealing with monster storms.</p> <p>The challenge of course is whether either Obama or Romney will care to make that link on the campaign trail.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The question, Suzanne writes, is how much climate change might be to blame for storms like Sandy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Climate change certainly makes strong storms even stronger. There is ample evidence that global warming is responsible for the increasing intensity of Atlantic hurricanes and a longer hurricane season \u2013 but no single storm can be attributed to global warming.</p> <p>Five of the top north Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded occurred in the last eight years, including Katrina, Rita, and Ivan.</p> <p>Hurricanes are now producing greater storm surges, heavier rain and more flooding than in the past as evidenced by Irene last year, which caused widespread flooding in the north-east, and Debby last June, which produced up to 2ft of rain in some locations in Florida.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change has led to warmer oceans and a warmer environment and more moisture for these storms which makes them more intense than they otherwise would be,\u201d said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado.</p> <p>The warmer atmosphere and sea surface temperatures provide extra fuel for those storms. That extra boost, combined with heavy and prolonged rain, stronger storm surges and coastal erosion in places, mean severe storms can pack a punch even relatively far inland. \u201cWhat it really does is that it gives rise to a greater risk of flooding,\u201d Trenberth said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-26T19:42:19.579Z\">at 8.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508ade8bb5793e5495b45138\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-26T19:03:40.106Z\">8.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mayor Michael Bloomberg</strong> has just held a news conference about how New York City is preparing for Sandy. </p>  <p>Bloomberg said Sandy is expected sometime Monday.

Sandy is currently just north of Grand Abaco Island in the Bahamas off the coast of Florida. The storm is moving slowly, about 6mph.

Second, it appears to be moving toward heavily populated areas. Third, its impact could be compounded by a potential intersection with a storm predicted to be moving out of the interior US toward the Atlantic coast early next week.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The last major storm to threaten the northeast coast was Hurricane Irene, which made landfall in Brooklyn, New York on 28 August 2011 and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irene#cite_note-tcr-0\">caused</a> an estimated $15.8bn in damage,</strong> making it one of the costliest storms in history.</p> <p>The National Weather Service and other forecasters are watching Sandy closely.

  "<p>A Congolese gynaecologist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/14/doctor-mukwege-congo-war-rapes\" title=\"\">known for his work with victims of sexual violence</a> has told how a quick-thinking friend saved him from assassination and paid with his own life.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.panzihospital.org/about/dr-denis_mukwege\" title=\"\">Denis Mukwege</a>, who has won numerous awards and been nominated for the Nobel peace prize, narrowly escaped death when five gunmen in civilian clothes attacked his home in Bukavu, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, on Thursday night.</p> <p>\"I thought they would kill me,\" he told the Guardian. \"These people got into my home and my two daughters were there. They told them to sit down and not use the phone. They sat with them in the dining room and waited until they heard my car drive up.\"</p> <p>One of the assailants opened the gate and forced Mukwege out of his vehicle. \"I was at one side of the car and the man was at the other side,\" Mukwege continued. \"He came to me and tried to shoot me but Jeff [a man employed at Mukwege's home] was behind him and called out. The man turned around and shot him two times.\"</p> <p>Out of instinct Mukwege threw himself to the ground. \"He turned back to shoot me but I was already down. He jumped in the car and left quickly.\"</p> <p>The gunmen are believed to have swiftly abandoned Mukwege's car before hijacking another vehicle. Their identity and location are unknown.</p> <p>Mukwege, 57, is relieved that his family are unscathed but mourning the death of the man he always knew simply as Jeff, a trusted friend and employee who was the same age as him. \"The man worked with me a long time,\" he said, his voice cracking with emotion. \"It's a terrible loss for me and all my family.\"</p> <p>The motive for the assassination attempt is a mystery. \"Why? I don't know. They didn't ask me for money or anything.\"</p> <p>Mukwege is the founder and medical director of the <a href=\"http://www.panzihospital.org\" title=\"\">Panzi hospital</a> in Bukavu, where he and his staff have helped treat <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/09/city-of-joy-congo-women-rape\" title=\"\">more than 30,000 survivors of sexual violence</a> \u2013 often gang rapes \u2013 by armed groups, including women in need of specialised gynaecological care. He has been described as \"<a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/where-repairing-rape-damage-is-an-expertise/article661687/?page=all\" title=\"\">likely the world's leading expert on repairing injuries of rape</a>.\"</p> <p>Mukwege also travels regularly to speak about the plight of these victims and he addressed the UN general assembly in September.</p> <p>His work has earned numerous international awards including the UN Human Rights Prize, King Baudouin Africa Development Prize, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7828027.stm\" title=\"\">African of the Year</a>, Olof Palme Prize and Clinton Global Citizen Award, while the Carter Foundation has named him a \"citizen of the world\".</p> <p>Word of the murder attempt caused anger and revulsion around the world. Activist and playwright Eve Ensler, founder of the V-Day global movement to end violence against women, who first travelled to Congo at Mukwege's invitation in 2007, said: \"One of the great men of the world was almost murdered tonight. We cannot let this continue, we must create an environment where it is safe for Dr Mukwege and all the people of Congo to live and thrive.\"</p> <p>There was speculation of a political motive for the attack. Describing Mukwege as \"one of my heroes\", <a href=\"http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/25/an-attack-on-one-of-my-heroes-dr-denis-mukwege\" title=\"\">New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof blogged</a>: \"Dr Mukwege presumably was targeted because of a strong speech he gave at the United Nations last month, denouncing mass rape in Congo and the impunity for it. President [Joseph] Kabila has long been angry at Dr Mukwege, and the UN speech can't have helped. Meanwhile, Dr Mukwege has also offended Rwanda with his denunciations of Rwanda's role in the slaughter and rape in eastern Congo.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.genderjustice.org.za\" title=\"\">Sonke Gender Justice Network</a>, a non-government organisation working for equality in Africa, said: \"We fear for the safety of Dr Mukwege and worry that this attempt on his life was directly linked to his advocacy work. It closely follows a speech he gave at the UN last month in which he denounced the country's 16 years of violent conflict and called for 'urgent action to arrest those responsible for these crimes against humanity and to bring them to justice.'</p> <p>\"We call on the DRC [Congolese] government to immediately ensure his safety. We also call on each of our own governments and the African Union to monitor the situation and to ensure Dr Mukwege's safety.\"</p>",
  "<p>Chip designer <strong>Arm</strong> ended a busy week on a downbeat note.</p> <p>The Cambridge-based company, which supplies Apple, Samsung and Microsoft, reported better than expected results on Tuesday thanks to booming smartphone royalties. It was also boosted by the launch later in the week of Apple's iPad mini and the unveiling of Microsoft's Windows 8, where the company has begun encroaching on Intel territory. But disappointing results from Apple after the market closed on Thursday took the shine off, and Arm's shares fell 8.5p to 656.5p. But they are still 65p up on the week. Credit Suisse issued a neutral rating on the company, but raised its target price from 538p to 645p. It said:</p> <blockquote> We conclude that markets are currently expecting an approximate 15%-20% upgrade to industry volume estimates for smartphones and tablets, Arm's key end markets. Further upside therefore requires an even greater upgrade to industry units or Arm holding higher market share than 95% smartphones, 85% tablets and 15% notebooks by 2016. <br> [Our] neutral rating is predicated on the conclusion that the majority of good news\u2014increasing royalties from uptake of newer processor technologies and graphics, retaining majority market share in smartphones and tablets, and gaining share in notebooks\u2014is already known and factored into forecasts. </blockquote> <p>As for Apple, its shares fell more than 1% in early trading. Analysts at Killik said:</p> <blockquote> Although the miss of consensus numbers was disappointing (although management guidance was beaten), a large part of it is understandable. Rumours surrounding the release of the iPhone 5 clearly impacted sales of other iPhones during the quarter and then supply issues have constrained the iPhone 5 sales in the quarter. The rumours of the iPad mini have also impacted sales of iPad in the quarter as consumers waited to see the relative attractiveness. <br> Following these results, we would expect consensus to come down by around 5%-10%. Reducing consensus by 10% and adjusting for Apple's large cash holding, it is currently trading on 10 times calendar 2013 earnings per share. We continue to view this as an extremely attractive valuation for the world's leading consumer electronics company in the lead up to its best quarter ever. We remain buyers and would use any price weakness to add to positions. </blockquote> <p>Apple was just one of a raft of US companies revealing disappointing results in recent days, ranging from Amazon to Caterpillar. That helped the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> lose 90 points over the week, although better than expected US GDP figures gave some comfort for the world's biggest economy, ahead of the presidential elections. So the leading index managed to edge up 1.66 points yesterday to 5806.71.</p> <p>Miners turned in a mixed performance with <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> down 21.5p at 714.5p but <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rising 10.5p to 3110.5p. But <strong>Anglo American</strong> was the star performer, adding 76p to 1933.5p on news of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/26/anglo-american-cynthia-carroll-step-down\" title=\"\">the proposed departure of under pressure chief executive Cynthia Carroll</a>.</p> <p><strong>African Barrick Gold</strong> dropped 16.5p to 465p after reporting a 72% drop in three month profits to $29m and downgrading its 2012 production forecast. Majority owner Barrick Gold of Canada is currently in talks to sell its 74% stake in the mining group to China National Gold Group Corporation.</p> <p>Insurers weakened on worries about the outlook in a low interest environment and amid falling markets. <strong>Prudential</strong> lost 16p to 837p, <strong>Aviva</strong> 3.1p to 330.1p and <strong>Standard Life</strong> 4.2p to 284p. But Andy Hughes at Exane BNP Paribas said the market had underestimated Standard Life's earnings potential, and added that the insurer could contemplate an \u00a3800m cash return to shareholders.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Pearson</strong> put on 9p to \u00a312.21 after it confirmed on Thursday it was considering a merger of its Penguin business with Bertelsmann's publishing arm Random House. Analyst Steve Liechti at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> We view this as a possible net positive but not game changer - while we see some earnings per share upside via near-term merger/cost synergies in a pressured top line business, this does not imply cash returns to shareholders or re-investment in long-term growth Education assets. If a move precedes exit of FT Group too, this would be good news. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Trinity Mirror</strong> fell 9.75p to 51.25p yesterday on worries about its involvement in phone hacking after legal claims were filed against the Daily Mirror on behalf of, among others, former England football manager Sven-Goran Eriksson.</p> <p><strong>Weir</strong> rose 29p to \u00a317.17 as Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the pumps group from \u00a314.40 to \u00a316.70 but kept its underweight rating:</p> <blockquote> Expectations look much more realistic now, although certain capital expenditure headwinds remain. Weir's risk-reward is improved, but not yet attractive. </blockquote> <p>Its shares have been buoyed recently by speculation of a possible takeover by the likes of US giant General Electric.</p> <p>Hedge fund group<strong> Man</strong> added 1.8p to 81.85p on hopes of action to boost its flagging performance. Odey Asset Management, founded by fund manager Crispin Odey, announced on Thursday it had raised its stake in Man from 1.25% to 5.15%.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Hibu</strong>, the oddly named owner of Yellow Pages which was formerly known as Yell, fell 8% to 0.33p after Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its credit rating on the struggling business from CCC+ to CC with a negative outlook. On Thursday the debt-laden company said it was suspending payments to its lenders pending completion of its restructuring, and warned its shares could be worthless. One bright spark was news that the Office of Fair Trading had recommended that the Competition Commission should consider relaxing a number of restrictions on the company which were introduced in 2007 when it was a major power in the market.</p>",
  "<p>The World Bank has <a href=\"http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings\" title=\"\">produced its 2013 list of the best places in the world to start and run a business</a>, ranking the UK in 7th place, below the US in 3rd and Singapore, which retained the number one spot. Germany could only manage 20th place and France secured a lowly berth at number 34 out of 183 countries ranked this week.</p> <p>There is a reasonable expectation that western countries will appear in the top 50 of a list that values a country that can offer speedy property registration and access to electricity. The rankings also reward countries that can boast a legal system which enforces contracts fairly and protects creditors when a company goes bust.</p> <p>Putting in place these basic building blocks should be meat and drink to developed nations, though persuading the local electricity supplier to plug new customers into the grid often seems difficult in all parts of the world.</p> <p>Yet there are many countries in or near the top 50 of the World Bank's rankings that have proved hugely controversial.</p> <p>Georgia, the former Soviet satellite state, has jumped into 9th place from 112th in 2005 after a decade-long struggle with corruption that the World Bank and anti-corruption agency <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Transparency International</a> claim is succeeding, but which many experts say still leaves many corrupt practices in place.</p> <p>More broadly, critics argue the World Bank rankings promote a neo-liberal agenda of privatisations, welfare cuts, limited employment rights and low wages to please and entice foreign multinationals.</p> <p>The anti-poverty charity <a href=\"http://www.careinternational.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Care International</a> says incomes and living standards remain low across most of the south Caucasus despite consistently high GDP growth. In a recent report on Georgia and Armenia, which has climbed the rankings above France to the number 32 spot, the charity said poverty is \"pervasive\".</p> <p>Peter Bakvis of the International Trade Union Confederation, says Georgia was rewarded for embarking on \"massive deregulation and the elimination of worker health and safety rules\".</p> <p>Georgia's GDP grew by 7.1% last year and is projected to grow by 4.5% this year, yet the official unemployment rate remains at 15%. Likewise Kazakhstan, which ranks at 49, has 47% of its population subsisting on low incomes according to a United Nations report and is high on most experts' list of corrupt countries.</p> <p>African trade unions make the same complaint. Some have seen their countries grow by 5% or more each year for a decade and leap up the Doing Business rankings while millions of their citizens suffer extreme poverty and workers cannot find a job that pays a decent wage.</p> <p>At a debate organised by the Bretton Woods project and supported by aid charity Cafod <a href=\"http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-571378\" title=\"\">during the World Bank's annual meeting in Tokyo earlier this month</a>, Augusto L\u00f3pez-Claros, director of global indicators and analysis at the Washington-based agency, was clear his mission is to fight poverty. He maintained that the business rankings showed which nations were stable economies and the ones tht provide a sound platform for wealth creation.</p> <p>Geoffrey Chongo of the Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection in Zambia is a long term critic of the rankings. He says most people in Zambia, which is one of the world's largest copper producers, have remained in poverty despite soaring national income growth and annual rises up the rankings.</p> <p>He argues the central African nation has proved unwilling or unable to generate taxes from mining companies, leaving ministers no option but to tax workers more heavily. Starved of domestic capital, the government was forced recently to borrow $750m (\u00a3465m) from the international markets in the form of a bond to generate much needed funds for investment.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez-Claros argued issuing a bond was a great achievement and revealed a high level of confidence in Zambia. But Chongo said Zambia's attraction was the 16% effective tax rate on corporations, while workers paid 25% on their incomes.</p> <p>Zambia earned a paltry $50m from mining royalty revenues in 2009 despite the industry generating \u00a35bn in sales. Corporation tax from other areas and PAYE brought the total to $500m, according to the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative. But at 10%, the tax rate was considered a failure by all but the Banda government, which scrapped a windfall tax that had previously gone some way to making up the tax gap.</p> <p>Similarly, Zambia was ranked 8th in the \"getting access to credit indicator\" in 2011, \"yet small businesses still cite access to credit as their biggest challenge with more than 90% of SMEs saying they lack access to credit with interest rates above 25%,\" says Chongo.</p> <p>He believes the Zambian government has been obsessed with getting a top 50 ranking and was prepared to starve SME development in favour of multinationals to get it. He can expect more of the same after a 10 place drop in the 2013 list to 94th as other nations worked harder to meet the criteria.</p> <p>Bin Han, one of China's senior representatives at the World Bank, says the rankings are fundamentally flawed.</p> <p>\"The Chinese conclusion is straightforward: the report has used a wrong methodology, failed to reflect facts in individual countries, and misled readers. The questionable quality of the report has ruined the Bank's reputation,\" he said at the debate.</p> <p>The new boss at the World Bank, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/jim-yong-kim\" title=\"\">Jim Yong&#xa0;Kim</a>, has pledged to review the rankings. Maybe he needs to scrap them in favour of individual country reports. It seems not only invidious but also farcical to say that Rwanda boasts a better infrastructure for business than Italy.</p>",
  "<p>\"Grandpa Wen,\" China's state media call him. Or \"The Premier of the People\". To many ordinary Chinese, China's 70-year-old premier Wen Jiabao is a series of endearing images \u2013 a grey-haired, bespectacled man playing basketball with primary school children, or bowing deeply to the families of natural disaster victims.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\" title=\"\">report in Friday's New York Times</a> gave Wen's populist image a makeover. The paper found Wen's family has accumulated more than $2.7 billion (\u00a31.68bn) in assets, much of it from investments in companies that were directly influenced by Wen's position.</p> <p>Analysts say Wen's role as the Chinese Communist party's friendliest face \u2013 a counterpoint to the stodgy, unsmiling bureaucrats that fill its ranks \u2013 has made the disclosure of his family's wealth a deep embarrassment to the leadership.</p> <p>\"Someone like Wen is a very good focal point for the party's overall narrative \u2013 that it's the only vehicle that can maintain the prosperity that the Chinese people have achieved over the last 15 or 20 years,\" said Rana Mitter, an expert on Chinese politics at Oxford University.</p> <p>Wen has made much of his humble origins \u2013 that he grew up in poverty in Tianjin city before getting a postgraduate geology degree in Beijing. His mother, a teacher, raised him amid the turmoil of the Sino-Japanese war. \"The untold suffering in the days of old China left an indelible imprint on my tender mind,\" he told the National People's Congress in 2003.</p> <p>In his 42-year political career, Wen has gained the reputation of an intellectual. He regularly opens speeches with lines from ancient Chinese poets and scholars, expounding on the virtues of perseverance and commitment to duty. While visiting President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda in 2006, he <a href=\"http://www.chinese-embassy.org.za/eng/zxxx/t280214.htm\" title=\"\">improvised a poem</a>: \"Fifty years of journey sharing weal and woe / Brings Chinese and African hearts closer and ever so,\" he said, according to the website of China's embassy in South Africa.</p> <p>He has long been an ambiguous figure for China-watchers. Some say he could be a crusader for reform; others call him a figurehead. He has expressed support for anti-corruption legislation in speeches around the world. He visited Sichuan after a 2008 earthquake thought to have killed 90,000 people and has met migrant workers during labour unrest.</p> <p>When a high speed train crash in the coastal city Wenzhou in June 2011 became a focal point for popular discontent with the speed of China's development, Wen was quickly on the scene. \"I believe related departments will seriously learn a lesson from this incident,\" he said at a press conference after inspecting the crash site. \"If there is any corruption exposed in the investigation, we will handle it according to the law, and the consequences will be severe.\"</p> <p>Yet if Wen has enacted any real political reform, none of it is obvious. After his visit to the earthquake zone, the government harshly cracked down on activists demanding a list of the dead. His goal of improving migrant worker rights has gone largely unrealised. Corruption in China is still endemic, the country's wealth gap yawning, its thuggish state security apparatus stronger than ever.</p> <p>Analysts usually maintain one of two views on Wen, according to Mitter. \"One is that he's been genuinely trying to push for reform within the party, but has been isolated and not been allowed to succeed because of vested interests,\" he said. \"The other is that this is essentially a piece of self-aggrandizement by Wen.\"</p> <p>Analysts debate the importance of a photograph showing Wen standing alongside former premier Zhao Ziyang while visiting Tiananmen Square student protestors in 1989. While some say that Wen's proximity to Zhao \u2013 a staunch reformer who was placed under house arrest after the protests \u2013 shows his sympathy for the students' cause, others say it betrays nothing but a strong survival instinct, an impressive ability to further his career despite a dangerous political association.</p> <p>Wen has scored at least one big victory in his time as premier: he is widely considered instrumental in sacking the Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai \u2013 a charismatic leader with a flair for Mao-era grandiosity \u2013 triggering the party's most dramatic political upheaval in decades.</p> <p>\"The new problems that have cropped up in China's society will not be fundamentally resolved, and such historical tragedies as the Cultural Revolution may happen again,\" he told a political meeting in March, hours before Bo was stripped of his post.</p>",

  "<p>I'm knee-deep in water as I look up to see the sun filter through the tree canopy. Monkeys dance along branches and the colours of the rainforest are so vivid they take my breath away. We reach the other side, soaking and tired, pull ourselves up onto the bank and navigate our way through the dense undergrowth.</p> <p>I hear a noise behind me, look to my shoulder and see a dark red stain developing. Confused, I look around, and am greeted by the smiling face of ranger Abass Kaina. He points to the floor, where a large insect lies, now in two parts.</p> <p>\"Mr Gareth, I save your life! That is most poisonous insect in all of forest, one bite and you would be dead. Welcome to Sierra Leone.\"</p> <p>I'm on patrol with the forest rangers of Gola rainforest national park. I'm spending two days with them, gathering data and hopefully preventing poaching as well as illegal mining and subsistence farming within the park. My aim is to get to know the rangers and experience a day in their life. I want to know what challenges they face as well as what gives them the most satisfaction at the end of each day.</p> <p>The rangers are friendly from the offset, but I have the feeling they are discussing me, the \"Puimoi\" (white man), in their local language of Mende. I sense something's up. It later becomes obvious, they're testing me. The rangers begin frequently changing the pace, starting slow and sprinting off, testing to see if I can keep up.</p> <p>We walk down cleared paths at speed, occasionally veering off into the dense jungle. I can feel their eyes on me at all times, putting me through my paces, as I juggle cameras with branches and clamber over submerged logs. Will this \"Puimoi\" become a liability?</p> <p>Thankfully we make it to the camp together, get a fire started and take off our wet clothes. The rangers noticeably relax towards me by the end of the patrol and are talking much more freely now. They don't hold back when I ask them about the challenges they face, everything from wearing out their footwear on the tough terrain to GPS receivers breaking when they're on patrol.</p> <p>I ask how their communities view their roles as rangers. They tell me that some of the local people don't always understand the rangers' role and how they protect the forest for the benefit of the communities. This won't change overnight, but what I've seen elsewhere on my trip gives me confidence that the community development projects and education work that the RSPB and its partners supports are changing attitudes.</p> <p>The wider reality is these men are viewed by many conservationists as the \"hands-on heroes\". Some of the people they catch undertaking illegal activities are armed and while the team are passionate about saving the rainforest, they would never go into a situation that was unsafe. Their training, coupled with a genuine pride in the forest, ensures that poachers, miners and illegal farmers are stopped and handed over to the authorities.</p> <p>By the end of the patrol we are firm friends, and they turn the tables and ask me questions about my life in the UK. They give me the Mende name of \"Kenei Buakei\" \u2013 which they assure me isn't derogatory \u2013 and we swap email addresses and promise to stay in touch.</p> <p>I hope their communities come to accept and appreciate the critical work they do here. It's tragic that they don't always get the respect they deserve for safeguarding the forest that so many other local people have told me is vital for their lives.</p> <p>We say our goodbyes. \"Mr Gareth, very nice job. We are all impressed.\" I tell them it's nothing compared to the jobs they do in incredibly difficult circumstances. Their cheeks burn with embarrassment and pride, and with that they silently melt back into the jungle.</p> <p>\u2022 Gareth was in Sierra Leone reporting on Tesco and the RSPB's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/feb/23/tesco-rspb-rainforests\" title=\"\">Together For Trees partnership</a>.

  "<p>Cycling's global governing body has ruled&#xa0;the seven consecutive Tour de France races won by Lance Armstrong should remain forever without a champion as a warning from history, as the disgraced Texan confirmed he would not appeal against the decision to strip him of his&#xa0;titles.</p> <p>Armstrong has not responded to the United States Anti-Doping Agency's accusation that he led \"the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen\", but his Texas-based lawyer Tim Herman told the Guardian on Friday that the 41-year-old would not appeal against the International Cycling Union's ratification of Usada's verdict this week.</p> <p>The UCI management committee also called on Armstrong and others who have been caught doping to return their prize money, set up an independent commission to look into its own role in the affair and suspended its legal action against the journalist Paul Kimmage while that investigation is carried out.</p> <p>Despite the UCI announcing on Monday that it would ratify Usada's damning verdict that Armstrong was a \"serial cheat\", its president, Pat McQuaid, came in for further criticism after questioning<strong> </strong>aspects of the report in a series of supporting documents later released online.</p> <p>The decisions taken by the UCI's management committee in Geneva will be seen as an attempt to regain the initiative but could backfire on McQuaid and the honorary president, Hein Verbruggen, if the independent commission finds that they did not do enough to tackle doping.</p> <p>Faced with the reality that 20 of the 21 top-three finishers between 1999 and 2005 were implicated in doping, the UCI ruled that Armstrong's victories would not be awarded to any other rider, nor other placings upgraded. Instead, the Tour de France will enter the year of its hundredth staging with a roll call of 92 winners.</p> <p>\"The UCI management committee acknowledged that a cloud of suspicion would remain hanging over this dark period \u2013 but that while this might appear harsh for those who rode clean, they would understand there was little honour to be gained in reallocating places,\" it said in a statement.</p> <p>While it \"called on Armstrong and other affected riders to return the prize money they had received\", the UCI did not say what action if any it would take to recover it. Armstrong is already facing potential legal action from SCA Promotions over the \u00a36.9m bonus it was forced to pay in 2005 after Armstrong insisted in a tribunal that he had never used performance-enhancing drugs.</p> <p>The independent commission will look into the UCI's role in the Armstrong affair, including claims \u2013 which it denies \u2013 that it hushed up a suspicious test result in return for donations totalling $125,000, as well as finding ways to \"ensure that persons caught for doping were no longer able to take part in the sport, including as part of an entourage\".</p> <p>A rule brought in by the UCI in June last year already bars anyone convicted of doping after that date from working as an official or coach. But the commission, the make-up and remit of which will be announced in the week of 5 November, will be tasked with looking into the practicalities of a more wide-ranging ban.</p> <p>The commission, to be appointed by an \"independent sports body\", will deliver its report no later than 1 June.</p> <p>McQuaid again tried to draw a distinction between the depth of the problem before and after he took over as president in 2005, despite the Usada report claiming there was evidence that Armstrong continued doping following his comeback in 2009.</p> <p>\"As I said on Monday, UCI is determined to turn around this painful episode in the history of our sport,\" he said. \"We will take whatever actions are deemed necessary by the independent commission and we will put cycling back on track.</p> <p>\"Today, cycling is a completely different sport from what it was in the period 1998 to 2005. Riders are now subject to the most innovative and effective anti-doping procedures and regulations in sport. Nevertheless, we have listened to the world's reaction to the Lance Armstrong affair and have taken these additional decisive steps in response to the grave concerns raised.\"</p> <p>On Monday McQuaid insisted the defamation case against Kimmage, who accused the UCI of taking a six-figure donation from Armstrong to turn a blind eye to doping suspicions, would go ahead.

About 50% of customers pay by credit card which means we receive the funds within three days, about 25% are issued with pro-forma invoices where we require payment before delivery and the remaining quarter are invoiced on 30 day terms. We pay our suppliers on 30-45 day terms which should ensure strong cashflow.</p> <p>We can have a squeeze when global corporations put us on 60-90 day payment terms meaning we are obliged to pay suppliers before receiving customer payment.

  "<p>Unless you work with it on a daily basis, big data is relatively unknown, both as a term and a concept. Even among industry experts its definition is the subject of intense debate. To some the key characteristic is a database's volume, to others it is its complexity, or even the speed at which data is gathered and analysed.</p> <p>To you and I, big data is probably best understood as the enormous datasets held by corporations, governments and other large organisations whose activities affect millions of people. Big data is used to determine your recommended friends on Facebook, suggested purchases on Amazon and the point at which your mobile phone network offers you a freebie to keep you on side.</p> <p>Some of these datasets, such as details of every one of a retailer's sales, will have a consistent format, with others stored as unstructured text. While it can be easy to dismiss big data as overly corporate, irrelevant outside the business world, it is becoming increasingly clear that it can be - and is being - a force for good in the wider world.</p> <p>Below are some examples.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Fraud detection</strong></h2> <p>Tax fraud is a growing concern for governments looking to cut their deficits, and big data is being used to increase the efficiency of fraud detection processes. Where privacy law allows, government departments can now cross-reference tax databases with other information such as vehicle registrations and overseas travel data to find individuals whose spending patterns and tax contributions do not add up. While a suspicious result is not direct evidence of fraud and cannot be used to incriminate an individual, it can help officials better target their auditing and other checks and procedures.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Healthcare and medicine</strong></h2> <p>The mapping of the human genome is widely regarded as one of the most significant advances in the history of medical research. The ability to map a person's genetic profile now allows doctors and scientists to predict a patient's susceptibility to certain diseases and other adverse conditions, and the major reductions in the time and cost of carrying out the procedure would not have been possible without big data.</p> <p>Improvements in the speed and functionality of data collection, storage and analysis tools have lowered the cost of sequencing from almost \u00a32bn to around \u00a32,000 today, and cut the time it takes from over a decade to a week. While more incremental gains would have taken place at any rate, such major strides have only been made achievable by the cloud computing services offered by - among others - Microsoft, Amazon and <a href=\"http://www.teradata.com/\">Teradata</a>.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Humanitarian efforts</strong></h2> <p>The United Nations launched <a href=\"http://www.unglobalpulse.org/\">UN Global Pulse</a> in 2009 with the primary aim of using best practices in the big data industry to enable the organisation to make faster and better informed responses to humanitarian crises. A project using social media analysis to <a href=\"http://www.unglobalpulse.org/discoveringtrendsinbigdata-CHguestpost\">track public concerns in Indonesia and the US</a> has already showed the value such methods hold for crisis response and social science research as a whole.</p> <p>There are a number of other organisations working towards similar goals, including <a href=\"http://datakind.org/\">DataKind</a>, whose founder Jake Porway led a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/oct/03/datakind-london-data-dive\">'DataDive' earlier this year in London</a>, where data scientists collaborated with charities to offer analysis-driven solutions to recurring problems.</p> <p>US organisation <a href=\"http://www.awhere.com/en-us\">aWhere</a> is carrying out similar work, and in one of flagship projects uses data from satellite imagery to <a href=\"http://www.awhere.com/en-us/mosquito-abatement\">find and map pools of stagnant water</a> in developing nations that could become breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitos.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Privacy</strong></h2> <p>These datasets often contain detailed and potentially revealing information about us, giving rise to concerns over the implication for privacy, and this an issue taken seriously by firms working with big data.</p> <p>US firm Teradata, for example, impresses upon its data scientists that simply obeying privacy laws is not enough - they should take Google's 'don't be evil' motto one step further, using their work to make a positive change.</p> <p>This ideology was yesterday given substance when leading British data scientist Duncan Ross launched the <a href=\"http://www.causes.com/actions/1694321\">'Doing good with analytics' pledge.</a> Signatories commit to taking account of the potential wider impacts of their analysis and to using their skills to help those who could benefit the most.</p> <p><em>Full disclosure: I spent the last four days in Washington DC attending the Teradata Partners' Conference at the expense of Teradata Europe, Middle East and Asia.</em></p> <h2>NEW!

In addition to this, a subscription includes access to the new 'Eyewitness Series' collections, which present a single standout picture each day during major world events.

  "<p>The New York Times <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/26/wen-jiabao-wealth-new-york-times\">has been blocked in China</a> for reporting that premier Wen Jiabao's family have controlled assets of at least $2.7bn (\u00a31.67bn). The report is particular embarrassing for Wen because he has made a point of stressing his modest background.</p> <p>The issue of politicians' financial worth is almost as sensitive in the US and UK, as voters in those countries continue to suffer from the economic crisis. In the US presidential race, Barack Obama has attempted to paint his opponent, Mitt Romney, as out of touch with mainstream American life partly because of the vast wealth the Republican accumulated during his business career. The president told Romney during one of the presidential debates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHnzTKVWc_s\">I don't look at my pension.

  "<p>Healthy corals that lie deep below the ocean's surface may be the key to regenerating parts of Australia's badly damaged Great Barrier Reef, according to an underwater survey being carried out off the coast of northern Queensland.</p> <p>Using remote operated vehicles (ROVs) and deep-sea diving techniques, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/26/google-maps-virtual-diving-reef\" title=\"\">Catlin Seaview Survey</a> has found healthy coral habitats at depths of 30-120 metres, right underneath badly damaged areas of the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>\"Some of the shallow areas of the reefs we've been diving on have been completely devastated by cyclones, but as soon as we dive to depths of 40m and below, the areas are almost completely untouched,\" said Pim Bongaerts of the University of Queensland's global change institute, who is leading the deep reef survey.</p> <p>Until now, very little has been known about the deep reefs and knowledge has been largely limited to depths of 30m, which is accessible by scuba diving. For the first time, the survey's findings suggest deeper waters may provide a form of refuge for corals.</p> <p>\"One of the most striking things we've seen is the abundance of coral on the deep reef, even at 70 or 80m. We have also already seen a few species in the deep areas that also exist in the shallow water,\" said Bongaerts.</p> <p>This may suggest that the upper and lower corals are part of the same population and have moved between deep and shallow waters, which could be an important part of regenerating the damaged upper reef.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/01/great-barrier-reef-coral-cover\" title=\"\">a report by the Australian Institute of Marine Science</a> showed that coral cover in the shallow part of the Great Barrier Reef has dropped by more than half over the past 27 years, with 48% of the damage caused by storms.</p> <p>Using the ROV vehicles to film and collect samples from the deep reef on this scale is \"simply unprecedented\" in Australian waters, according to Carden Wallace, principal scientist at the Museum of Tropical Queensland, who has been examining the survey's samples.</p> <p>\"Up until now, we've only had a very small number of specimens from deep reefs, mostly dredged samples, totalling about 20. Already the survey has collected more than 10,000 deep coral specimens (from below 40m),\" she said.</p> <p>The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef ecosystem in the world, stretching 2,000km along the Queensland coast.</p>",

  "<p>Burma has taken another step towards reintegration into the global economy with the announcement by the <a href=\"http://www.adb.org/countries/myanmar/main\" title=\"\">Asian Development Bank</a> (ADB) of a strategy that sets the stage for a resumption of full operations in a country cut off from western funds for decades.</p> <p>The bank has not provided direct assistance to Burma since 1988, but has maintained contact with the government through the country's participation in the Greater Mekong sub-region programme, a regional economic integration initiative. The ADB is the first multilateral development bank to approve an interim country partnership strategy for Burma.</p> <p>\"ADB will work with the government to create jobs and lay the foundation for long-term economic growth that benefits the country as a whole,\" said Stephen Groff, ADB's vice-president for east Asia, south-east Asia and the Pacific. \"This strategy will guide our re-engagement with Myanmar [Burma] to make sure the country is set on a path of sustainable and inclusive growth.\"</p> <p>Burma has undertaken democratic reforms under President Thein Sein, including byelections held this year for parliament, in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/aung-san-suu-kyi\" title=\"\">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>, the Nobel laureate and pro-democracy leader, won a seat. A second wave of reforms was announced in June.</p> <p>The democratic opening has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/27/us-eases-burma-sanctions-clinton-sein\" title=\"\">prompted the US and other countries to lift sanctions against Rangoon</a>. Last week, Thein Sein said Burma's foreign investment law could be ready soon. However, western companies are still wary because of legal uncertainty over foreign investment laws, which are governed by a decades-old code.</p> <p>Burma, the largest country in mainland south-east Asia, sits on considerable natural riches, including arable land, forests, minerals, natural gas, fresh water and marine resources. The economy is dominated by agriculture and farm-related activities, which account for 36% of GDP and 60-70% of employment.</p> <p>Despite some progress on poverty reduction, primary education and gender equality, Burma remains one of the world's poorest countries, with a per-capita GDP of $857 (\u00a3536). It is ranked 149 out of 187 countries in the UN human development index.</p> <p>Burma's economic outlook is positive, however. The ADB notes that the country has been bolstered by strong export earnings from commodities and increased foreign investment, and forecasts that Burma's GDP growth will accelerate from about 5.5% this year to 6.3% in 2013 and 6.5% in 2014. In the near term, the ADB will roll out grants aimed at helping government ministries to better plan and implement development projects, manage reforms and improve data gathering.</p> <p>A central aim of the ADB's strategy is to narrow the income gap between urban and rural areas, and to close the development gap with Burma's neighbours. To boost growth, the ADB will work with the government to identify key infrastructure investments, particularly in transport and energy. The bank will collaborate with communities on infrastructure and other projects to improve livelihoods in rural areas \u2013 including ethnic minority areas \u2013 where the majority of people live.</p> <p>However, full resumption of ADB operations is contingent on the full settlement of Burma's $520.5m arrears with the bank. Japan has agreed to provide bridge loans to Burma through its Bank of International Co-operation so that the country's arrears to both the ADB and the World Bank can be cleared. This is expected to be done by January, paving the way for multilateral lending for Rangoon. In August, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19077440\" title=\"\">the World Bank said it was considering restarting aid to Burma</a>, adding that it was preparing up to $85m in grants.</p> <p>The UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Burma, Tom\u00e1s Ojea Quintana, has emphasised that human rights should lie at the heart of the country's reform. <a href=\"http://undocs.org/A/67/333\" title=\"\">He acknowledged in a report the dramatic economic development Burma will experience over the coming years</a> (pdf), but highlighted concerns about land and housing rights, including \"land grabbing\". He also made recommendations on private companies and foreign investment to help ensure a sustainable form of development that is not exploitative.</p> <p>\"Human rights considerations need to shape the process of economic growth, legislative reform and institutional change, while also guiding responses to ongoing serious human rights situations, including in Rakhine and Kachin states,\" he said.

On Friday, Downing Street said such contingency planning was something that was done as a matter of routine.</p> <p>They have pointed US officials to legal advice drafted by the attorney general's office and which has been circulated to Downing Street, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>It states that providing assistance to forces that could be involved in a pre-emptive strike would be a clear breach of international law on the basis that Iran, which has consistently denied it has plans to develop a nuclear weapon, does not currently represent \"a clear and present threat\".</p> <p>\"The UK would be in breach of international law if it facilitated what amounted to a pre-emptive strike on Iran,\" said a senior Whitehall source. \"It is explicit. The government has been using this to push back against the Americans.\"</p> <p>Sources said the US had yet to make a formal request, and that they did not believe an acceleration towards conflict was imminent or more likely. The discussions so far had been to scope out the British position, they said.</p> <p>\"But I think the US has been surprised that ministers have been reluctant to provide assurances about this kind of upfront assistance,\" said one source. \"They'd expect resistance from senior Liberal Democrats, but it's Tories as well. That has come as a bit of a surprise.\"</p> <p>The situation reflects the lack of appetite within Whitehall for the UK to be drawn into any conflict, though the Royal Navy has a large presence in the Gulf in case the ongoing diplomatic efforts fail.</p> <p>The Guardian has been told that a British military delegation with a strong navy contingent flew to US Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Florida, this summer to run through a range of contingency plans with US planners.</p> <p>The UK, however, has assumed that it would only become involved once a conflict had already begun, and has been reluctant to commit overt support to Washington in the buildup to any military action.</p> <p>\"It is quite likely that if the Israelis decided to attack Iran, or the Americans felt they had to do it for the Israelis or in support of them, the UK would not be told beforehand,\" said the source. \"In some respects, the UK government would prefer it that way.\"</p> <p>British and US diplomats insisted that the two countries regarded a diplomatic solution as the priority, but this depends on the White House being able to restrain Israel, which is nervous that Iran's underground uranium enrichment plant will soon make its nuclear programme immune to any outside attempts to stop it.</p> <p>Israel has a less developed strike capability and its window for action against Iran will close much more quickly than that of the US, explained another official. \"The key to holding back Israel is Israeli confidence that the US will deal with Iran when the moment is right.\"</p> <p>With diplomatic efforts stalled by the US presidential election campaign, a new push to resolve the crisis will begin in late November or December.</p> <p>Six global powers will spearhead a drive that is likely to involve an offer to lift some of the sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy in return for Tehran limiting its stockpile of enriched uranium.</p> <p>The countries involved are the US, the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China. Iran will be represented by its chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili.</p>",

We focus on people from three perspectives: consumers, clients and our staff.</p> <p>1. Consumers<br>We spend more time talking to consumers than any other media agency. All our communications is built on genuine consumer insight, so to fully experience how the changing media landscape informs lives, attitudes and behaviours. This is exemplified through one of our pioneering research initiatives called \"Real World Streets\u2122\", which goes beyond simply reporting what consumers say, to understanding what they actually do. Because often, what people say and what they do, are two different things.</p> <p>2. Clients<br>We focus on clients from four different angles \u2013 by driving accountability forward, by offering the best value in the market by ensuring the highest possible standards of media implementation, and by future proofing our clients' businesses so they are the first to exploit the new opportunities of emerging media.</p> <p>3. Our staff<br>We employ the best people in the industry. To attract them, develop them and keep them, we strive to give our staff a fresh and inspiring environment. We make this real through tangible initiatives that empower our staff to reach their potential and to move our business and our clients' businesses forward.

  "<p>A few years ago, on one of my visits to China, I was invited to speak to a group in Shanghai called <a href=\"http://www.vision2050.cn/\" title=\"\">Women in Sustainability Action</a> (Wisa). The organisation was set up by a former academic colleague, Jacylyn Shi, as a global network of professional women working in sustainability.</p> <p>This got me thinking about the relationship between women and sustainability \u2013 and especially how this dynamic is playing out in China.</p> <p>According to professor Kellie McElhaney, founder of the Centre for Responsible Business at University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business, companies that empower women are more likely to be companies that act sustainably.</p> <p><a href=\"http://responsiblebusiness.haas.berkeley.edu/Women_Create_Sustainable_Value_FINAL_10_2012.pdf\" title=\"\">A research paper written by McElhaney and Sanaz Mobasseri</a> found that businesses with more women on their board of directors are more likely to: manage and improve their energy efficiency; measure and reduce their carbon emissions; reduce their packaging impacts; invest in renewable power; improve access to healthcare in developing countries; have strong partnerships with local communities; offer products with nutritional or health benefits; proactively manage human capital development; offer transparent financial products; have anti-corruption policies and programmes; have a high level of disclosure and transparency; and avoid controversies such as accounting fraud, price fixing, criminal behaviour among top executives, controversial customer practices and insider trading.<strong> </strong></p> <p>But why is this? It's a topic for hot debate and there are probably as many opinions as there are commentators. Do men have inherently unsustainable ways of acting in the world? Does testosterone fuel the exploitation of our planet and its people? Are women our best hope for creating a sustainable future?</p> <p>Elle Carberry, co-founder and managing director&#xa0;of the <a href=\"http://www.china-greentech.com/\" title=\"\">China Greentech Initiative</a> believes that women may be drawn to sustainability because of its social angle. \"From all my 20 years in business, I have met more women in this area than in others [areas of business],\" she says. \"Be it in China or the United States.\"</p> <p>She adds: \"It does strike me that women come to this with a view about society and business.</p> <p>In China, women also appear to be playing an increasingly important role in sustainability and for one Chinese woman in particular, this \"view about society and business\" turned her into the wealthiest self-made woman in the world. Zhang Yin, also known by her Cantonese name Cheung Yan, is the founder and director of Nine Dragons Paper, a recycling company that buys scrap paper from the US, imports it into China, and turns it mainly into cardboard for use in boxes to export Chinese goods.</p> <p>In 2006, she topped the list of the richest people in China and by 2010 her $4.6bn (\u00a32.9bn) fortune placed her ahead of the likes of Oprah Winfrey and JK Rowling. She has said that she built her entire business empire on some simple advice that she received in Hong Kong in 1985: \"Waste paper is like a forest \u2013 paper recycles itself, generation after generation.\"</p> <p>Peggy Liu, co-founder of the Joint US-China Collaboration on Clean Energy (Juccce), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/peggy-lui-building-chinese-dream?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">is working to create a China Dream concept to divert China</a> away from a mass consumerist path and is targeting high-level officials to spread her message and give foreign companies and experts access to China's decision makers.</p> <p>Carberry believes that \"the markets associated with China going green might be some of the biggest markets ever.\" She approached the head of General Electric (GE) in China in 2008 and asked if he would support a knowledge sharing platform and network to help accelerate the scaling of clean technology.</p> <p>\"He jumped at the idea immediately,\" she recalls. \"And when I asked him why he was so keen, he said, 'in China the opportunity is too big, the problem is too urgent and China is too complex. We can't do it alone. &#xa0;We all \u2013 GE, Dow, Bayer and others \u2013 see a piece of it, but none of us see how the whole thing comes together'\". &#xa0;And so the China Greentech Initiative was born.</p> <p>Today, the platform pulls together information on cleantech, checks and analyses that data and brings together a network of interested companies, policy makers and organisations to identify opportunities.&#xa0;It certainly seems to be working. According to the 2012 Ernst &amp; Young ranking of country attractiveness for renewable energy investments, China leads the world, ahead of the US and Germany.</p> <p>Yin and Carberry are just two of many such pioneering women taking on sustainable business in China. Others, to name but a few, include Jin JiaMan, director of the Global Environmental Institute, Chen Zhili, chair of the China Women's Federation, Li Chun Mei, founder and general manager of Wealth Environment Engineering Co, and Anne Myong, chief operating officer of Walmart, who realised the lack of leadership on CSR and is now devising a clearer strategy.</p> <p>However, Kaying Lau, country director for the <a href=\"https://www.globalreporting.org/information/news-and-press-center/Pages/Moving-East-The-uptake-of-sustainability-reporting-in-China.aspx\" title=\"\">Global Reporting Initiative in China</a>, says despite these role models, millions of women are still under-represented. But with more high-profile role models, the hope is that more will be empowered to join the sustainability revolution.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Sustainable mobility cannot be achieved without building a framework in which mobility, and the automotive industry in particular, can develop its own solutions without being isolated in an innovation process that doesn't work.</p> <p>My definition of sustainability is development that does not consume resources but uses and reuses them, ideally endlessly. The word conjures up a vision of the future which is not compromised by an unsustainable present. But the term often fails to offer suggestions on how to avoid or how to measure the sustainability of different choices we make now.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-loop_lifecycle_management\" title=\"\">closed loop management</a> of resources highlights a route towards sustainability, and allows us to measure the grade of sustainability from different choices, based on whether or not we are able to avoid the consumption of resources. It also allows us to rate the choices and the kind of resource consumption we want.</p> <p>There are five pillars for sustainability in the mobility sector, which is closely linked to the energy sector. These are:</p> <p>\u2022 Renewability of energy resources.</p> <p>\u2022 Efficiency in energy conversion, distribution, use.</p> <p>\u2022 Lowering of environmental impact.</p> <p>\u2022 Increasing of energy accessibility.</p> <p>\u2022 Tailor making of energy systems on local social-economic-environmental conditions.</p> <p>If all of these five conditions are satisfied, then energy and mobility choices can be defined as sustainable.</p> <p><strong>An era of energy vectors</strong></p> <p>The necessity of using renewable resources opens up <a href=\"http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/ourportfolio/themes/energy/subthemes/Pages/sustainable.aspx\" title=\"\">a key role for energy vectors,</a> energy carriers that are renewable and can be used to replace current fossil energy carriers, for example oil with hydrogen.</p> <p>A new energy era \u2013 the one that will follow the current 'fossil fuels period' \u2013 cannot be based on a single energy source. If energy-using technologies are standardised, this will need to accommodate a number of different energy vectors from different sources that they can be used without emissions by the end user. Two excellent energy vectors that allow this system to be put in place are electricity and hydrogen.</p> <p><strong>Beyond smart grids: the intelligent energy system</strong></p> <p>Our towns and regions are becoming more and more 'intelligent', and the same is going to happen for energy and mobility systems.</p> <p>Smart electricity distribution grids are already being developed, but they are not the final solution. To effectively use the vectors in the energy and mobility system, a larger and more complete intelligent energy system is needed, where local production and storage of renewable energy through the appropriate energy vector (for example, electricity and hydrogen in a Toyota Prius) can be managed by the overall energy and mobility system in order to ensure that the five pillars of energy sustainability are being followed.</p> <p>Something very interesting is also happening thanks to the diffusion of smartphones. Apps \u2013 small, simple, easy-to-use codes that can be downloaded at a very low cost by a very large number of users \u2013 are changing the how we do things. Energy and mobility can take advantage from the increasing use of smartphones and growing connectivity. The connected environment can accelerate the spread of the 'right energy in the right place' and of the 'right mobility at the right moment' ideas.</p> <p>A clear vision of sustainability, together with a transparent use of resources, vectors and related environmental impacts, can drive us to the best solution: sustainable mobility based on renewable resources and intrinsically useful to the economic development of any region.</p> <p><em>Fabio Orecchini is co-ordinator of the energy and mobility systems section of CIRPS - the Inter-university Research Centre for Sustainable Development at the University of Rome</em></p> <p><em>Fabio will be part of the panel for a debate on the future of mobility on 14 November. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/future-sustainable-transport-solving-global-gridlock?INTCMP=SRCH\">Guardian Sustainable Business will be live streaming the discussion</a>.

  "<p>Details of World Bank-financed contracts will be available online as part of a global initiative to fight corruption and get governments to disclose their deals with private companies.</p> <p>Sanjay Pradhan, vice-president of the World Bank Institute \u2013 the capacity development branch of the World Bank \u2013 said the organisation would \"walk the talk\", ensuring its own contracts are disclosed while helping countries open their books. \"We need to be credible partners to do this,\" he said.</p> <p>The move will embolden the nascent <a href=\"http://www.open-contracting.org/\" title=\"\">Open contracting initiative</a>, a global campaign to increase disclosure and participation in public contracting. Estimates suggest governments around the world spend $9.5tn (\u00a35.8tn) a year contracting private companies to provide goods and services, but these deals are often shrouded in secrecy. In some developing countries, procurement can account for up to 70% of public spending.</p> <p>Under the initiative, details and copies of contracts funded by public money will be online in a bid to reduce corruption and increase value for money.</p> <p>\"Corruption, opaque contracting processes and poor oversight of contract implementation are undermining results and citizens are paying the price in terms of schools not being built, environmental damage, bridges not fixed to standard and hospitals unable to offer necessary medicines,\" says the campaign, arguing that \"creating a level playing field with transparent and fair contracting processes \u2026 benefits all of society \u2013 government, private sector and citizens.\"</p> <p>Pradhan said the effort, which is backed by the World Bank Institute and the German government, fits into the bank's anti-corruption work and its broader \"open development\" agenda, both of which have support from the very top of the bank.</p> <p>\"It's inherent in our DNA that we cannot tolerate corruption, we cannot tolerate any kind of blemish to the reputation of the bank on the fiduciary side,\" said Pradhan. \"It's a natural evolution for the World Bank and the bank needs to play a leadership role in this area.\"</p> <p>The bank finances public contracts worth up to $13bn each year. It already publishes some information for its major contracts but would release further details under the Open contracting initiative, which aims for the disclosure of all relevant documents, from pre-award activities through to the awarding of contracts and the implementation of projects.</p> <p>Pradhan said the bank would also disclose contracts for its central, corporate procurement and that the International Finance Corporation, the bank's private-sector lending arm, is phasing in new requirements to disclose contracts for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2012/oct/25/niger-resources-nigerien-people-video\" title=\"\">extractive industries projects</a> (video).</p> <p>The initiative builds on recent efforts by some governments to increase transparency around contracts. Georgia, for example, publishes all information around public contracts, including correspondence around original bids and details of payments from the state treasury. This month the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jeToCRcnTTPxwvZw8mReCM1HMTgA?docId=CNG.c36ac90c578becd9b22b3b70fe27a38e.731\" title=\"\">Afghan government disclosed</a> hundreds of mining contracts online.</p> <p>Yama Torabi, from <a href=\"http://www.iwaweb.org/\" title=\"\">Integrity Watch Afghanistan</a>, an NGO that monitors reconstruction projects in the country, welcomed the move. \"This is the first time we can see how our natural resources have been contracted to private companies. We can now look at whether this was done in the national interest, for the benefit of the people,\" he said.</p> <p>Torabi, who was in Johannesburg this week for the first Open contracting global meeting, said it will take years to roll out the initiative, which must find a way to include information about sub-contracts. \"We really need to see who's getting the money at the end of the chain,\" he said. He added that a lack of literacy skills, reliable electricity and internet access will in some areas limit the initiative's promise to strengthen public monitoring of contracts.</p> <p>One of the biggest challenges in achieving full disclosure of contracts will be the resistance of companies that claim such moves violate commercial confidentiality. Peter Eigen, founder of <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Transparency International</a>, said that although companies have the right to secrecy when contracting with each other, \"different rules have to apply\" when a government is party to a contract. Eigen added that confidentiality clauses are often overprotective and \"sloppily written\", and must be subject to scrutiny.</p> <p>Increased transparency alone is unlikely to satisfy critics of the World Bank, who say the lender's procurement rules favour big companies from industrialised and emerging economies. \"A lack of transparency in tendering, tendering in large lots, and restrictive eligibility criteria make it difficult for small and medium enterprises from developing countries to compete against large multinationals,\" <a href=\"http://eurodad.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/WB_procurement_review_final1.pdf\" title=\"\">said a group of civil society organisations</a> (pdf) last month.</p> <p>This year, the bank launched <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/PROJECTS/PROCUREMENT/0,,contentMDK:23147564~pagePK:84271~piPK:84287~theSitePK:84266~isCURL:Y,00.html\" title=\"\">a separate review of its procurement policies</a>, which is expected to lead to new rules in 2014.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Claire Provost spoke at the first global meeting on open contracting in Johannesburg this week.

  "<p>When talking to diplomats, policymakers and journalists from around the EU, by far the most common question I get is: \"What do you think the Tories will do on Europe?\"</p> <p>That question may soon have to be revised. It may not be the Tories, but the Labour party that will decide Britain's place in Europe \u2013 possibly even pushing it out altogether.</p> <p>Much can happen before 2015, but there is a possibility that the Tories could suffer defeat at the polls at the next elections. Then Brussels' biggest fear \u2013 a sweeping Tory-led renegotiation of the UK's EU membership terms \u2013 will not materialise, at least not any time soon. Instead, either as part of a Lib-Lab pact or majority government, the ball will be in Labour's court. So what will Labour do?</p> <p>In its 2015 election manifesto, the Conservative party could well promise renegotiation followed by a referendum on the result. It's far from set in stone, but increasingly likely. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/01/conservatives-europe-referendum-cameron-eu\" title=\"\">Tory scepticism on Europe</a> as an issue may not allow David Cameron to get away with less. Labour effectively has two choices in how to respond:</p> <h2>Option one: <br></h2> <p><strong>Gamble on Europe not being an electoral issue.</strong> The thinking is that the EU always ranks low on the list of voters' concerns. National elections are never fought over Brussels. This is only partially true. Europe is a low priority if presented as a single issue \u2013 but the fact is, it's not. To varying degrees, it permeates other issues such as the economy, general trust in politicians and, most importantly, immigration (which consistently ranks high) \u2013 something that is likely to be established by the current government's \"<a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/global-issues/european-union/balance-of-competences-review/\" title=\"\">balance of competences</a>\" review. Labour could try ducking the question in a campaign, but if the Tory party manages to successfully tap into the public's growing hostility towards the EU status quo \u2013 and with the eurozone's demands for greater integration unlikely to go away \u2013 it could really hurt Labour.</p> <h2>Option two:</h2> <p><strong>Promise a referendum of their own and so neutralise the Tories' pledge.</strong> The Labour party is unlikely to promise a public vote on a renegotiated EU deal \u2013 in large parts, they have already rubbished the idea \u2013 so it will have to be a straight in/out vote. The plan would be to call a referendum shortly after the elections, campaign for a yes, win the vote and move on to other business.</p> <p>This would be a massive gamble. The experiences of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in France and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20019669\" title=\"\">Mariano Rajoy in Spain</a> show that political honeymoons are rare in today's EU politics. And heaven knows what Europe and the British economy will look like in 2015/2016, with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/eurozone-crisis-live\" title=\"\">Greek bailout package</a> set to expire, for example. If the referendum coincides with, say, a major new drive for more EU integration, with fresh demands put on the UK; and with a large number of Tories campaigning to leave (more likely in opposition), the British public may be pushed over the edge. It would then be Labour that unintentionally pulls the UK out of Europe.</p> <p>There may be some options in between, such as promising a referendum on forthcoming treaty changes \u2013 or pledges to pursue some milder reforms \u2013 but that will not sound overly convincing. And even leaving aside the referendum issue, Europe could hit Labour like a steam train: in a few years' time, the free-standing \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Fiscal_Compact\" title=\"\">fiscal treaty</a>\" is meant to be incorporated into the EU treaties. Will Labour nod that through, given that it effectively codifies the Bundesbank-style austerity, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/ed-balls-austerity-has-failed-in-europe--we-must-all-now-go-for-growth-7858045.html\" title=\"\">much criticised by Ed Balls</a> and co? Will it veto Germany's plans for a fiscal discipline commissioner, if they materialise? How will it relate to the evolving eurozone banking union and potential accompanying treaty changes? Will it tear up the coalition's EU \"<a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/international/eu-referendum-lock\" title=\"\">referendum lock</a>\"? The more the eurozone agrees to do in common, the harder it will be for the UK to stand still. In fact, the eurozone crisis means that the status quo is no longer an option for Britain.</p> <p>The problem is that, fundamentally \u2013 and much like the Tory leadership itself \u2013 it does not yet appear that Labour knows what it wants for the UK in the multi-tier Europe that is developing. The previous Labour administration's policy of simply sitting in the \"euro waiting room\" and hoping the public would come along for the ride is no longer credible. However, the wing of the party that said it always opposed euro membership has yet to articulate what its alternative plan is.</p> <p>There are a lot of good and clever people on Labour's front benches. So far, it has suited Labour to treat Europe as a coalition pi\u00f1ata. Not for much longer. Labour now has the chance to develop a coherent and positive European vision and a plan of its own \u2013 designed around a flexible model for EU co-operation, in which Brussels does less in the UK, but does it better. Bank on the status quo or Tory splits, and both the party \u2013 and Europe \u2013 may be in for some unexpected surprises.</p>",

  "<h2>It is vital to me that my children grow up with a respect for their environment</h2> <p>I have chosen not to send my eldest child to school full time here in France because I want him to play outside more as his little brother does. We live near a river and a beautiful wild park where there is a playground. A boat takes you from one side of the river to the other where children run free yet can be seen for miles. On the way to school they stop to pick up acorns which they \"cook\" in their \"kitchen\" at home. My eldest is four and yet sticks are still his favourite toy. If they watch television (rarely) it is often David Attenborough. When it rains they go out to splash or fish in puddles in rain suits. </p> <p>We have no play things in our garden, only a hand made sand pit where they make cakes and play with diggers. They have an interest in our flowers and a great appreciation of the weather as a result of having few \"outdoor toys\". I feel a pressure to have these things but I resist. When they want to play it is a perfect excuse to go to the park and see the goats, the allotments, the river, nature and LIFE. </p> <p>It is vital to me that they grow up with a respect for their environment and when they are bored I find it healthy because it feeds their imagination. As a child we made rose perfume and sold it on the roadside. They cannot do that here but I am growing many sorts of flowers so they can pick some and make their own games with them. The other day they spent 20 minutes watching a snail!</p> <p>\u2013 Anon</p> <h2>Living in the city doesn't mean that our children don't have lots of play opportunities</h2> <p>We have a five- and a seven-year-old. We encourage them both to play outside and as they get older we are gradually allowing them to be more independent. We want to keep our children safe but we are aware that it's easy to overprotect them if we let our fears take over. </p> <p>Our five-year-old has recently started playing football on the pavement outside our house with his friends and we're delighted that he has stopped asking to watch TV when he gets in from school and is getting lots of exercise. </p> <p>We live in inner-city Hackney and only have a small garden, but we have great parks nearby where we spend a lot of time and the council has recently announced a year-long trial of <a href=\"http://playingout.net/\">Playing Out</a> events when residents can apply to have the road closed on a regular basis so that children can play out. It's got lots of support from local residents and is a great way to make full use of our streets and promote a sense of community. </p> <p>We also go camping two or three times every summer so that our children get the chance to build dens, climb trees, get filthy and generally play with friends without constant adult supervision. Just because we live in the city doesn't mean that our children don't have lots of play opportunities!</p> <p>\u2013 Vanessa </p> <h2>A lack of playmates doesn't help</h2> <p>It is so important for children to have freedom just to be. They are so used to instant results and being entertained that hey lose the ability to just splash in a puddle, dangle upside down or slide down a muddy bank. </p> <p>Even though we live in a rural area surrounded by countryside, it is hard to get them to go out and play. For us it is the lack of playmates to go out with due to a very small population equating to not very many children. Most of the surrounding open space is farmland, not necessarily accessible for free play, with a lot of open water that is often in flood. The most successful outings are ones with friends in tow! Time constraints also limit play with long journeys to school or for any out-of-school recreation or essential activity.</p> <p>\u2013 Kirsten</p> <h2>What's missing is the independence I enjoyed growing up</h2> <p>We're really lucky to live in a part of London with woods and heath very close by, and my wife, five-year-old son and I do spend hours in/on both, when the weather permits.</p> <p>I think what's still missing - and I don't know if it can be put back - is the independence I enjoyed, growing up. We had less appealing playgrounds than my son has, but we were more free to go off and explore them on our own, learning valuable life lessons on the way. I simply wouldn't dream of letting him go off for hours on his own - not even when he's much older.</p> <p>\u2013 Matt Baylis </p> <h2>They learn so much more from doing things outdoors </h2> <p>When my first son was a baby, I read some advice on bringing up boys that stuck in my head: like dogs, they need to be fed &amp; watered often, and exercised outside every day! </p> <p>I now have three sons, aged 4, 2 and 5 months, and I still make sure they get to walk (or run, or scoot, or dangle in the sling) outside every day. We are lucky - we live next to a huge park where they can climb trees, pick blackberries, eat picnics, build snowmen, make 'mud soup', collect leaves, launch rockets, hunt for squirrels, play chase and a million other games they invent. Often we jump in the car to explore new play parks, walk in the woods, or go pond dipping, dam building or kite flying. </p> <p>As preschoolers, they learn so much more from doing things outdoors than they would ever absorb from a game or book.</p> <p>It makes us all feel good, it's free, and from a tired parent point of view, it's much easier than keeping them entertained indoors. Not that they don't watch TV and DVDs - they watch quite a bit. But as long as they've had at least a couple of hours running off their energy outside each day, I don't stress about downtime on the sofa. </p> <p>\u2013 Isabel Thomas</p> <h2>Outdoor areas are greatly underused in many schools</h2> <p>I believe outdoor play is essential for children (and adults) of all ages. I set up an informal outdoor playgroup in my area to find other families who want to meet up weekly and explore, have fun and discover wilder, natural outdoor places. My three-year-old loves these sessions and I think my three-month does too (or at least he usually sleeps really well during them). </p> <p>The children gain so much from playing and exploring the woods, fields or wherever we happen to be with each other. As there are different ages and abilities, they often encourage and support each other to try more things and be more creative than they would if alone or just with parents. </p> <p>My three-year-old's nursery also has a great attitude to outdoor play and encourages the children to be outside for large chunks of the day, even in poor weather. We are currently looking at schools and a key question of all the schools for me is, 'How much outdoor play and outdoor learning does the school do?'. The outdoor area is a greatly underused resource in many schools, which is a great shame.</p> <p>\u2013 Philippa Mitchell</p>",

  "<p>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi owner Publicis Groupe has reported worse than expected third-quarter results, as an \"abrupt halt\" in client advertising spend saw global revenues go into reverse in September.</p> <p>It is the second warning in as many days of a slowdown in the advertising and marketing industry, after Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/25/wpp-slashes-growth-forecast-soft-olympics?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">dramatically cut its full-year forecast</a> and warned of tough times ahead.</p> <p>Publicis Groupe, one of the world's largest marketing services groups, reported revenue growth of 2% for the third quarter to \u20ac1.63bn, only half the rate that investors and analysts had expected, with the listed group's shares falling almost 4% in early trading.</p> <p>The group cited Europe as the issue with third quarter revenues falling 3.6%.</p> <p>Southern European revenues slumped by 8.7% in the third quarter. The UK market fell 0.8% while, France and Germany declined 2.2% and 1.8% respectively.</p> <p>The biggest concern was September, which Publicis Groupe had expected to grow by 6.6%, which fell by 1.6%.</p> <p>\"September saw a downturn as sharp as it was unexpected,\" said the Publicis Groupe chief executive, Maurice L\u00e9vy.</p> <p>\"The slowdown in the global economy \u2013 with a particularly sharp downturn in European economies \u2013 brought advertising investment to an abrupt halt.\"</p> <p>He added: \"This was a summer of contrasts: the upward trend continued through July and August, then September brought a sudden downturn in the economies of Europe. While southern Europe has seen a steady decline in advertising markets, starting in September, northern Europe suffered downturns as severe as they were sudden.\"</p> <p>He said that advertisers were taking a \"wait and see\" attitude and cancelled or postponed ad campaigns. Publicis Groupe's home market of France has suffered the most, he added.</p> <p>Levy hinted at job cuts to come if the malaise in the mature ad markets of Europe in particular continues.</p> <p>\"In the light of current global economic growth forecasts, and the marked slowdown in the mature economies, the group is paying closer attention than ever to its cost structure and adjusting rapidly to the situation over the quarters ahead,\" he said.</p> <p>Outside of Europe, Publicis Groupe fared much better.</p> <p>North America grew by 3.2%, although the company admitted that September revenue growth fell below expectations.</p> <p>A grouping of nine countries including Brazil, Russia, India and China grew at 8.5%. The rest of the world grew by 3.6%.</p> <p>\"The areas of concern are clearly identified and limited both geographically and by sector and in no way undermine the potential of Publicis Groupe,\" said L\u00e9vy.</p> <p>UK revenue went against the trend, rising by 4.7%.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Apple has disappointed Wall Street for the second quarter in a row after results released on Thursday showed iPad sales had grown less than expected.</p> <p>The quarterly results beat the company's own forecasts with net profits up 24% to $8.2bn (\u00a35bn) and revenues up 27% to $36bn \u2013 giving profits of $8.67 a share.</p> <p>But Wall Street analysts, used to years of Apple overshooting its estimates, had forecast profits at $8.75 per share, prompting the stock to drop below $600 in after hours trading from its official $609 close.</p> <p>Sales of iPhones grew faster than forecast, by 58%, to 26.9m \u2013 with the quarter including one week when its new iPhone 5 was on sale \u2013 but the 26% growth in the iPad line to 14m units was lower than anticipated.</p> <p>With signs of consumer demand reviving in the UK and US, analysts hope Apple's next quarter will benefit from a revamped iPad, its iPhone 5, which chief executive Tim Cook called \"the largest product ramp-up in Apple's history\" and its new iPad mini announced this week.</p> <p>Others fear the global slowdown hitting the eurozone and Asia will hold it back. Cook told analysts that China provided about 15% of revenues over the past four quarters.</p> <p>Apple is forecasting revenues for the current quarter of $52bn \u2013 against analyst forecasts of $55bn. A year ago its revenues were a record $46.3bn, suggesting that it expects revenue to grow 12.2%.</p> <p>Sales of iPads were noticeably below analyst forecasts of 15.3m \u2013 though some thought that the slowdown could have been due to the growing number of reports during the summer of the expected launch of the iPad mini. Cook said it is \"clear that customers delay new tablet purchases due to rumours of new products\".</p> <p>Analysts had expected sales of iPhones at 25m to 26m.</p> <p>Cook expressed optimism for the present quarter. \"We're very proud to end a fantastic fiscal year with record September quarter results,\" he said. \"We're entering this holiday season with the best iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod products ever, and we remain very confident in our new product pipeline.\" The iPhone 5 had been widely expected ahead of its launch, and preorders began two weeks before the close of the quarter \u2014 and sales began the week before its end.</p> <p>Apple's iPad mini is expected to cash in on the apparent demand driven by Amazon and Google for smaller tablets with seven-inch screens. But finance chief Peter Oppenheimer said in a conference call that the \"mini\" has \"substantially lower\" profit margins than Apple's overall margins.</p> <p>Sales of iPods, the product launched 11 years ago this week and which drove Apple's second phase of growth after it nearly fell into bankruptcy in the 1990s, fell by 25% year-on-year to 4.9m. Sales of Macintosh laptop and desktop computers grew very slightly by 0.6% to 4.9m \u2013 against a backdrop of falling PC sales worldwide.</p> <p>Oppenheimer revealed that $83bn of Apple's $121bn in cash is held outside the US. Repatriating it would trigger a huge tax bill, which the company has so far avoided.</p> <p>Meanwhile, before the results announcement, stock in the music streaming service Pandora was hit by a Bloomberg report claiming that Apple will launch an ad-supported internet radio service in the new year.</p>",
  "<p>China's foreign ministry has accused the New York Times of smearing the country by reporting that the premier Wen Jiabao's extended family has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\" title=\"\">controlled assets worth at least $2.7bn</a> (\u00a31.67bn).</p> <p>A spokesman, Hong Lei, said the report \"blackens China's name and has ulterior motives\". Authorities have also blocked the news organisation's main and Chinese-language websites and banned searches for \"New York Times\" in English and Chinese on microblogs.</p> <p>\"China manages the internet in accordance with laws and rules,\" Hong told reporters at a daily briefing when asked why the sites were inaccessible.</p> <p>The New York Times reported that several of Wen's close relatives had become extremely wealthy since his ascent to leadership. But in many cases their holdings were obscured by layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, colleagues or business partners, it said, in a detailed and lengthy account based on an extensive review of company and regulatory filings.</p> <p>A single investment held on paper by Wen's 90-year-old mother Yang Zhiyun \u2013 a retired schoolteacher \u2013 was worth $120m five years ago, the New York Times said. It added it was unclear if Yang was aware of the holdings in her name.</p> <p>The report is embarrassing not only for Wen himself \u2013 who comes from a modest background and is widely seen as the sympathetic, populist face of the government \u2013 but for the party. It is the latest in a string of unwelcome revelations about the vast wealth amassed by those around senior leaders.</p> <p>Authorities blocked the Bloomberg website earlier this year after it exposed the multimillion-dollar assets held by the extended family of Xi Jinping, heir-apparent to the presidency. The news agency has also reported that relatives of the disgraced politician Bo Xilai accumulated at least $136m in assets.</p> <p>Many people \u2013 particularly among the elite \u2013 had been aware of rumours about Wen's relatives, but the full detail of the report and the scale of their assets is striking. The timing is also sensitive, given that the once-a-decade leadership transition is weeks away.</p> <p>But the blocking of the websites and censorship on Chinese microblogs means that many may remain unaware of the New York Times report.</p> <p>Several users commented on the article on the Sina Weibo service, but the remarks were quickly deleted. A BBC news report was blacked out in Beijing as it referred to the article.</p> <p>Wen has repeatedly stressed the need to curb corruption, urging leaders to ensure their families and associates do not abuse government influence, and pushed for officials to disclose the assets of their immediate families.</p> <p>Such declarations are not made public and the Times said four-fifths of the assets they found were held by relatives such as his mother, younger brother and various in-laws \u2013 none of whom would be covered by the party rules.</p> <p>A former government colleague of Wen's, who spoke anonymously, told the Times: \"In the senior leadership, there's no family that doesn't have these problems \u2026 His enemies are intentionally trying to smear him by letting this leak out.\"</p> <p>A US diplomatic cable obtained by WikiLeaks, dating from 2007, quoted an executive in Shanghai as saying: \"Wen is disgusted with his family's activities, but is either unable or unwilling to curtail them.\"</p> <p>In March, the prime minister made a point of telling reporters at his annual press conference that he had \"never pursued personal gain\", adding that while he had faced criticism, \"history will have the final say\".</p> <p>Wen's mother's shares, and those of other relatives, were held via an investment vehicle, Taihong, run by Duan Weihong, a wealthy businesswoman close to Wen's wife. Weihong told the Times that the investments were actually her own but she had sought a low profile so asked relatives to find other people to hold the shares on her behalf; they had by \"accident\" and without her knowledge chosen the prime minister's relatives.</p> <p>Wen's wife, Zhang Beili, who is rarely seen with her husband, works in the diamond trade. Their son Winston Wen runs New Horizon Capital, now one of China's biggest private equity funds.</p> <p>His wife Yang Xiaomeng told the Times: \"Everything that has been written about him has been wrong.</p> <p>\"He's really not doing that much business any more.\"</p> <p>The Times said members of Wen's family had declined to comment or did not respond.</p> <p>Separately, the Brookings Institution said the brother of the man expected to replace Wen Jiabao \u2013 Li Keqiang, already vice-premier \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-25/china-leader-s-job-at-odds-with-tobacco-ties-brookings-says-1-.html\" title=\"\">should be moved from his post as a senior official at China's state-owned tobacco monopoly</a>. Li oversees public health as part of his duties.</p> <p>His younger brother Li Keming is deputy director of the tobacco body and Cheng Li, author of the Brookings report, suggested his role might have set back attempts to curb tobacco use in China.</p>",

According to <a href=\"http://www.networkrail.co.uk/about/performance/\" title=\"\">Network Rail's statistics</a> 87.8% of East Coast services in the year to 13 October 2012 were described as \"punctual\" \u2013 that is arriving at their destination within 10 minutes of the scheduled time.</p> <p><strong>Seating</strong> The majority of carriages on the train were standard class, with each containing a small number of table seats with the rest in airline style.</p> <p><strong>Staff </strong>The on-board staff were polite and friendly, with frequent announcements about the facilities offered.</p> <p><strong>Facilities </strong>This East Coast service contained a full on-board cafe and trolley service. Items included coffee (\u00a32.20), tea (\u00a31.85), a bacon butty (\u00a33.55) and chocolate bars (80p), with a minimum card spend of \u00a35. Wi-Fi is available on board all services, free to passengers travelling in first class but costing \u00a34.95 an hour or \u00a39.95 for 24-hours in standard class, although the latter are given 15 minutes of free internet access.</p> <p>The train was generally well kept, with on-board toilets in a clean and tidy condition.</p> <p><strong>Rating</strong> 7/10.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.grandcentralrail.com/\" title=\"Grand Central website\">Grand Central</a></h2> <p><strong>Background </strong>Grand Central is one of a handful of open-access operators running rail services in the UK. It was given approval to operate services <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/mar/24/transportintheuk.travelnews?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"Small-scale train operator given green signal on east coast\">between London and the north-east in 2006</a>, with its first trains running by the end of 2007. Founded by former British Rail area manager Ian Yeowart in 2000, Grand Central was sold to transport giant Arriva in November 2011.</p> <p><strong>Services </strong>Grand Central runs four daily services in each direction between London King's Cross and Sunderland, via Hartlepool and York. A fifth daily service is due to be added in December 2012. The firm also operates three services in either direction between London and Bradford, via Doncaster and Wakefield.</p> <p><strong>Ease of booking </strong>The Grand Central website contained plenty of information about its services and destinations, no booking fees were charged and first-class postage was offered free of charge.</p> <p><strong>Price </strong>York to London King's Cross: anytime single \u00a375; anytime return \u00a3120; off-peak single \u00a350; off-peak return \u00a385.</p> <p><strong>Was it on time? </strong>The service tested between York and King's Cross departed on time and arrived in the capital a minute ahead of schedule. Unfortunately, Grand Central punctuality statistics are not published by National Rail.</p> <p><strong>Seating </strong>The service had one first-class coach with the rest of the train taken up with standard class carriages. The standard coaches had a good mix of airline style and table seats, all with ample leg room.</p> <p><strong>Facilities </strong>The on-board cafe had a good range with competitive prices. Tea and coffee (\u00a31.50), a bacon butty (\u00a33) and chocolate bars (80p) were on offer, as well as playing cards and travel games. Passengers wishing to pay by card had a minimum spend of \u00a36. Wi-Fi is offered to all customers free of charge, while the on-board toilet facilities were more than adequate.</p> <p><strong>Staff </strong>The on-board crew were well-mannered, especially when confronted with a troublesome customer in the carriage. The on-board announcements, however, were perhaps too frequent for most people's tastes.</p> <p><strong>Rating</strong> 9/10.</p> <p><strong>Adam's verdict</strong> One of the few sections of UK railway to have more than one operator in direct competition, the York to London stretch is served by two competent providers in East Coast and Grand Central. East Coast is a considerably bigger firm and Grand Central was not able compete on the number of services offered, although it has already announced plans to add more in the near future.</p> <p>Walk-up prices were considerably cheaper on Grand Central, with anytime return tickets nearly \u00a3130 cheaper than its rival. However, both firms offer a wide range of cheaper advance tickets.</p> <p>The carriages on the Grand Central train were far roomier than those on East Coast, with more table seats available and considerably more leg room. Grand Central also offered free Wi-Fi and the prices of on-board snacks were far cheaper.</p> <p>Despite running fewer services, the lower prices mean Grand Central is worth waiting for.</p> <h2>Last week</h2> <p>We pitted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/19/itunes-blinkbox-which-better\" title=\"iTunes or blinkbox  which is better?\">iTunes against blinkbox</a> in the battle of the film downloads.

  "<p>Retired people should <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20044862\">work for their pensions</a>, says Lord Bichard. The fact that pensioners already have worked for their pension, by definition, doesn\u2019t detain him. Pensioners are a \u201cnegative burden\u201d on the state, who need to be \u201cincentivised\u201d into doing jobs that young people could do for a wage.</p> <p>The interesting thing about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/lord-michael-bichard\">Bichard</a> is that he isn\u2019t some rabid Tory. He is a cross-bench peer, a technocratic former senior civil servant who worked closely with the last Labour government. His suggestion was raised in the context of discussions between politicians, bureaucrats and Bank of England experts on the state\u2019s response to demographic change.</p> <p>And while his specific idea may have been off-centre, they point to a consensus among policy-making elites. In general, the consensus is that British capitalism will find its way out of crisis and restore global competitiveness by squeezing more work out of the labour force. In terms of pensions, the consensus is that people will have to work longer, for less.</p> <p>Part of the rationale for this consensus is that the \u201cold age dependency ratio\u201d is going to change dramatically, with a growing elderly population relative to the working-age population. By 2051, just under a quarter of the population will be over 65.</p> <p>According to a simplistic inference, pensions would therefore have to be paid for by raising taxes on the working population. However, labour migration counteracts this tendency, meaning that the \u201ceconomic support ratio\u201d, the ratio of the working population to the dependent population, will either remain static or any fall will be compensated for by increased productivity. The demographic rationale is therefore a red herring.</p> <p>The real issue is how the growing pensions system will be managed. The orthodoxy among civil servants and politicians alike is that salvation lies with \u201cthrift\u201d and private sector provision. This means relying on a costly complex of financial entities to provide coverage, while grinding down public pensions. This explains the Tories\u2019 introduction of the workplace pensions scheme. The result will be inequality and greater poverty in old age.</p> <p>Bichard admits that forcing pensioners to work will be hard to sell to the public. But then, as he puts it, \u201cso was tuition fees\u201d. There is a lesson in governance here. Senior civil servants and technocrats formulate many of the policies or underlying policy goals that governments try to gain public support for. Formally neutral as far as the party system is concerned, they are the permanent administration of the country.</p> <p>All three main parties agree on the broad lines of pensions policy. The differences between them are to do with the circumstances in which they govern, and their social base. The last government had a terrific fight with public sector workers to compel them to work until the age of 67, as part of an initial step towards raising the state pension age. As a result of the economic crisis, however, the Tories and Liberals have been able to press ahead with the policy.</p> <p>Ironically, though, the Tories have some of the greatest difficulties in winning support for such policies. Older voters still form a disproportionately large part of their electorate. This is why, despite raising the pension age, they also pledged a modest increase in the state pension. A party of ruthless cutters they may be, but they still have to keep an eye on their base. And this necessitates a degree of manoeuvring that obscures the underlying consensus.</p> <p>Take the recent coalition debacle over pensions. In July, the Tories sent out a stalking horse named Nick Boles to suggest that <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tories-plan-to-axe-pensioners-benefits-7924940.html\">old-age benefits such as winter fuel payments should be cut</a>. The Lib Dems backed him, urging the government to start looking at cuts in the next parliament. With monumental chutzpah, after it became clear that this wouldn\u2019t wash, the Tories then turned round last month and said they were opposed to heartless Lib Dem schemes to cut benefits for older people, with Iain Duncan Smith calling it a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/liberaldemocrats/9567254/We-will-fight-Nick-Cleggs-granny-wealth-tax-say-Tories.html\">granny wealth tax</a>\u201d. This ironically left the Tories defending universal benefits in this case, with the Liberals attacking them from the right.</p> <p>It is understandable that technocrats insulated from electoral pressures find it easier to articulate these ideas. But why can the Liberals be more open about this agenda than the killer-instinct Etonians? Partly it will be because, unlike students, elderly voters never formed a core part of the Liberal vote. But they now seem to be responsive to different pressures anyway. Having governed without winning an election, they have embarked on an elite strategy based on influence-mongering, proving their credentials through experience in government, positioning themselves for future coalitions, rather than building a sustainable democratic base.</p> <p>We should pay attention to the likes of Bichard because the grey men in suits can often be more honest about what they want to do with us than the elected politicians. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 March 2016. An earlier version referred to his \u201cspecific proposals\u201d that old people should work. Lord Bichard has asked us to clarify that he was being \u201dironic\u201d at the committee and denies that he was supporting the idea.<br></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/csr-mohin-guide-hugging-trees-critique\" title=\"\">In Adrian Henriques' critique of my book</a>, Changing Business from the Inside Out: A Treehugger's Guide to Working in Corporations, his main complaint is not about the value of my advice but the effectiveness of CSR itself.</p> <p>Henrique's primary argument is: can CSR ever be enough? He writes: \"That of course depends on how you define it. But Mohin seems to confine CSR to an exercise in navigational tactics: doing the best you can within the confines of a business case. CSR is not in the game of setting fundamental direction or strategy. Yet it is from questioning the viability of business models and strategy that real change derives. As a middle management discipline alone, CSR will essentially be reactive to external pressures and while doing the best it can, it will not challenge the systemic issues that are at the root of unsustainability\"</p> <p>Henriques misses the mark by asking whether CSR is enough. Of course it is not enough. Government, NGOs, trade unions, consumers, investors, the general public and consumers all have a role and responsibility for people and our planet. The right question to ask is \"would we be better off with or without CSR?\"</p> <p>CSR has caught our attention lately because it's a \"man bites dog\" story. We don't expect corporations to be responsible. We expect them to act in their own self-interest, which as history has shown, can come at the expense of the public's interests. But as corporations have grown in scope and scale, can we afford a world without CSR?</p> <p>With the scale of many corporations today, the short answer is no. Several companies <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-11/top-1-000-companies-wield-power-reserved-for-nations.html\" title=\"\">now have revenues in excess of the GNP of nations</a>. For example, If Walmart was a nation it would rank 22nd in GNP. During the US debt crisis in 2011, Apple had more cash than the US government. And since most of the largest companies operate globally, today's mega corporations have the ability, and I would argue the responsibility, to influence social and environmental conditions across the planet.</p> <p>I explore the impact of globalisation on CSR in my book. This trend is the primary reason that CSR is so crucial now. Multinational companies operate in countries around the world and have an even larger reach when you consider their supply chains. Conventional wisdom is that companies will seek the most lenient or lax social and environmental conditions. While it's undeniable that multinational companies source from low wage countries, it's not the case that these operations always despoil the environment and abuse workers. With good CSR practices, the presence of global industry can improve rather than worsen conditions.</p> <p>Due to the advent of CSR, multinational firms are now engaged in what has been termed private governance. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_governance\" title=\"\">Wikipedia's definition</a> of private governance is \"when non-governmental entities, including private organisations \u2026 make rules and/or standards which have a binding effect on the 'quality of life and opportunities of the larger public.' Simply put, private \u2013 not public \u2013 entities are making public policy.\"</p> <p>A clear example of this phenomenon is the <a href=\"http://eicc.info/eicc_code.shtml\" title=\"\">Electronic Industry Code of Conduct</a>. This document outlines standards for environment, health, safety, labour, human rights, ethics and management systems. Drawn from international standards, this code has been endorsed and enforced by more than 70 companies in the electronics industry.</p> <p>By adopting this code and requiring conformity by suppliers, these companies have made a commitment to proliferate social and environmental responsibility everywhere they do business. In doing so, they have taken on the traditional role of government by imposing these standards even in jurisdictions where they are lacking. In essence, this trend in private governance means that rather than repeating the ills of the industrial revolution in the developing world, CSR is lifting social and environmental conditions in places where these standards have yet to take root.</p> <p>Obviously, government and NGOs are also essential in our quest for sustainability. Without their oversight, some business will cut corners for short-term gains. It is equally obvious, that CSR middle managers alone cannot do the job without having support from top executives across the company. But standing on the sidelines and shouting that business is bad will not get the job done. If we accept the reality of large global businesses and seize on the rising trend toward responsibility, CSR practitioners can harness the power of business to make a massive difference.</p> <p>The reason I wrote the book was to do just that. While there are libraries full of books that cover the trend toward CSR, very few books provide a practical roadmap for working in the field. After working for many years in this area, I felt compelled to share what I have learned to enable the next generation of business leaders to continue to improve responsible business practices across the planet.</p> <p><em>Tim Mohin is the author of </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Business-Inside-Out-Tree-Huggers/dp/1609946405/ref=la_B008AC8V8S_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346018859&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><em>Changing Business from the Inside Out: A Treehugger's Guide to Working in Corporations </em></a><em>published by Greenleaf and Berrett Koehler.

  "<p>When it emerged two months ago that, despite a lengthy consultation period, most social landlords were yet to make formal plans over how to manage the government's green deal programme I was surprised. The opportunity to invest in retrofit and save tenants money when so many are facing fuel poverty <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/editors-blog/2012/aug/31/green-deal-social-housing-providers-indecision?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">seemed too good to miss</a>. So why the reluctance?</p> <p>After I shared my concerns on this blog, housing providers contacted me to explain why they were still holding back. Even a month before launch, it just didn't stack up financially or strategically for them \u2013 even with a <a href=\"http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/eco/government-offers-%C2%A3125m-of-green-deal-cashback/6524284.article\" title=\"\">\u00a3125m \"cashback\" pot</a> to encourage landlords to get involved.</p> <p>The early lack of clarity on how the scheme would eventually be funded and a general low level of interest among tenants and the wider community meant most social housing providers adopted a \"wait and see\" approach .</p> <p>They waited, but with little to see because when the deal finally arrived on 1 October it came with more of a whimper than a bang as the government chose a \"soft launch\" for the project. And no wonder. Eighty properties will need to be retrofitted every hour for the next 20 years to meet government targets while the construction industry is facing bigger structural problems. </p> <p>Although the economy is finally out of recession, the sector actually <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/eurozone-crisis-live-britain-emerges-from-recession\">shrank by 2.5% over the last quarter</a>. Could this soft launch be the sound of a policy being swept under the carpet?</p> <p>Nevertheless, the case for social landlords to use the deal to invest in their communities still seemed compelling. As Phyllis Boardman, director of Green Deal Nationwide, put it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Social landlords] reach into the very core of a community and understand mixed tenure and cohesiveness better than any other sector. With extensive and successful resident engagement models and an ability to cross-cut tenures \u2013 large scale retrofit programmes should surely be attractive.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now there is new research to back up that hunch. A <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2012/10/High-Rise-Hope.aspx\" title=\"\">study carried out by academics</a> at the London School of Economics, together with Rockwool, found that residents who experienced a large-scale retrofit programme in a high-rise development were positive about the impact that it had on their homes and communities. Upgrade work made them feel positive about their estate and safe living there. Despite two years of continuous construction work, a minority said the noise, dust and other disruption had inconvenienced them.</p> <p>However, the study also found that most residents thought retrofitting was simply a matter of improving the appearance of the estate, and did not understand that it had underlying benefits in improving energy efficiency and saving residents money on fuel bills. Only a third said their homes would be warmer or have fewer damp problems as a result.</p> <p>For the full value of those works to be realised, the researchers found that residents would have to \"buy into\" the changes and alter their behaviour around energy use and sustainability \u2013 a great opportunity to engage with and educate residents.</p> <p>The report concluded that retrofitting schemes have wider benefits for building relationship with residents and communities, according to co-author Anne Power:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are social reasons for doing these works There is a strong and well-documented link between taking care of places and creating a sense of community and belonging ... the urgency to reduce carbon emissions and save energy is creating new approaches to old problems, at a time when neighbourhood renewal programmes are in decline.</p> </blockquote> <p>So politics and funding policy aside, retrofitting has a clear value for social landlords \u2013 especially those able to harness the benefits of doing major work in high-rise blocks or over large estates. Whether or not the green deal itself stacks up for housing is not the only consideration. Can landlords afford not to retrofit, even if they choose go it alone?</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice </strong></p>",
  "<p>What is it really like to be responsible for corporate responsibility in a large company? Tim Mohin's book, <a href=\"http://www.greenleaf-publishing.com/productdetail.kmod?productid=3590\" title=\"\">Changing Business from the Inside Out: A Treehugger's guide to working in Corporations</a>, answers this question very well indeed.</p> <p>Addressed in the main to the aspiring CSR manager, it tells the story of how you will be \"responsible for a wide range of corporate behaviours and programs for which you have almost no control.\"</p> <p>If that doesn't put you off, then you will find that the majority of the book provides wise advice on how to negotiate the corporate whirlpools of business cases, committees and presentations and do the best you can for CSR. Assuming it is possible to reconcile making money and a passion for the state of the world, this book provides a manual for how to steer the corporate supertanker away from the rocks of unsustainability. It covers a range of issues, including reporting, supply chains and the environment. And it vividly conveys the rich experience that Mohin undoubtedly has.</p> <p>The guiding premise is that all this is better done from within. However important campaigning NGOs might be, for Mohin they pale in comparison to, say, leveraging a multinational corporation's buying power to improve conditions in its supply chain.</p> <p>But is that premise right? Mohin divides those companies active in CSR into two: those who have had an epiphany (they just get it) and the 2x4's (where a 2x4 is a piece of wood). The \"2x4 company\" has been whacked over the head, suffering a reputation crash, perhaps. Yet someone must be on the other end of each of those 2x4's; for every whack, there is an NGO or a journalist wielding the stick that has brought the issue to the attention of the world.</p> <p>Few companies start to think about their supply chain without attention from civil society. It is a moot point whether the NGO or the company in the end \"does more good\" or is more important. But I do recall a CSR manager in an oil company telling me that what he most needed was another NGO campaign to frighten his board \u2013 then he could really get things done. In the end both manager and campaigner are each absolutely necessary.</p> <p>Just as the efforts of a CSR manager need to be put in the context of civil society, the measures of CSR success \u2013 awards, peer comparisons and performance trends \u2013 need to be put in the context of actual sustainability. The question must always be asked: what if everyone did this (say produce 80% fewer tonnes of CO2e)? Would we then have a sustainable world? And would it make a difference if all companies gained the latest CSR award? Or are we in that wonderland where all that matters is that everyone must have a prize?</p> <p>Likewise, the company as a whole needs to be put in the context of its stakeholders. Of course stakeholders of every stripe figure prominently throughout the book. But the emphasis within CSR is on what your stakeholders can do for you: \"At its essence, stakeholder engagement is really about getting input on your program goals, progress and plans,\" Mohin writes.</p> <p>Again in Mohin's approach to materiality, a balance is to be struck between the importance of an issue to 'stakeholders' and the importance to the company. Yet 'the company' here really means a few powerful stakeholders, particularly shareholders and senior management. In this classic CSR materiality analysis 'the company' is given equal weight to all other stakeholders put together. Perhaps you should ask not what your stakeholder can do for you, but what you can do for your stakeholders.</p> <p>So my main criticism of this book is not so much about the extent to which it provides valid advice for those engaged with CSR \u2013 it does \u2013 but more about the nature and effectiveness of CSR itself, which this book does not question. Can CSR ever be enough? That of course depends on how you define it. But Mohin seems to confine CSR to an exercise in navigational tactics: doing the best you can within the confines of a business case.</p> <p>CSR is not in the game of setting fundamental direction or strategy. Yet it is from questioning the viability of business models and strategy that real change derives. As a middle management discipline alone, CSR will essentially be reactive to external pressures and while doing the best it can, it will not challenge the systemic issues that are at the root of unsustainability.</p> <p><em>Adrian Henriques is professor of accountability and CSR at Middlesex University and author of </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Corporate-Impact-Measuring-Managing-Footprint/dp/1844076539\" title=\"\"><em>Corporate Impact: Measuring and Managing Your Social Footprint</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/mohin-response-question-csr-henriques\" title=\"\"><em>You can read Tim Mohin's response to Henriques' article here</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Local government is facing a perfect storm: an economy in need of a boost; austerity, with reduced funding for public services and the councils that provide them; new reforms from government which cry out for local leadership.</p> <p>When I was leader of the Conservative Party, I initiated the James Review which identified \u00a335bn in savings across the public sector. It was controversial and some of the figures were hotly disputed by my political opponents. The siren claim of the time was that it was simply not possible to make such savings and improve services at the same time. More for less could not be done. How very old fashioned that sounds today.</p> <p>It's not simply a question of cost pressures for local authorities. Localism is already re-shaping the dynamic of many of the public services councils deliver. Personal budgets in social services are changing the relationship between citizens and councils. The new 'right to challenge' will further open up many of the services and functions of the traditional local authority. Councils will more and more commission services and hold those delivering them to account on behalf of their residents.</p> <p>This perfect storm offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for local government. I would argue that local government now lives in an opportunity society, some may call it a permissive society.</p> <p>One in which councils must define their role by action, not by right. In defining a new local leadership, I would argue it has two strands: economic, and civic, national imperatives at a local level. Of all of these, economic leadership is now the most critical.</p> <p>Councils need to become local drivers for growth and jobs. They have a pivotal role to play in promoting place and creating an environment conducive to business. Who should know the companies on their doorsteps best? Who controls planning? Who has the scale to stimulate new investment and growth? Who is best placed to join up locally? Local authorities.</p> <p>Civic leadership is closely linked to this. I define it as standing up for the interests of your residents. It's not just issuing a press release here or a newspaper story there, it's a complete cultural change. You will know you are doing it when your residents look to you as a matter of course and your services are changing to reflect new demands while, as councils, you are increasingly commissioning these services and not delivering them yourselves.</p> <p>In short: how do you change your role in the public eye from apologist if things go wrong in a service you deliver, to community champion \u2014 acting on behalf of your residents \u2014 to ensure that somebody else is delivering them right.</p> <p>The beauty is that the challenges in achieving this for council X may not be the challenges for council Y, and nor should they be.</p> <p>The Economist last month wrote of \"political petri dishes\" and the flourishing of \"bottom-up localism\". It looked to Barnet's 'Easycouncil' and the Tri-boroughs at one end of the political spectrum and Islington's \"fairness commission\" and Lambeth's co-operative council model at the other. Kent, Essex and East Sussex among others demonstrate further work to do things differently, rising to the challenge of localism in an era of austerity: where Wandsworth's pioneering privatisation helped transform the national economy of the 1980s, today we have an \"accidental revolution\" in local government.</p> <p>The joy of it is that you don't have to be told or wait for permission. Local government has entered a new and exciting phase and you are the leaders who can redefine local democracy and local leadership by what you do.</p> <p>The culture of government has changed. Leaders should no longer wait for national approval to take local action; no longer ask for sweeping new powers when the power to do almost anything through the power of competence rests in your own hands; no longer seek meetings with ministers if only to tell them your problems when all they really want is to get out of the way of your solutions.</p> <p>This year, the Olympics and Paralympics inspired a new generation of athletes. By your leadership at a local level \u2013 by reinvigorating the role of the local councillor and by exciting the leaders of tomorrow \u2013 you too can inspire a generation.</p> <p>The wave of the perfect storm has formed and it is up to you to ride it. The national economic situation undoubtedly provides a challenging backdrop, but it also presents a major opportunity for local government. Fortune, I hope, will favour the brave.</p> <p><em>Lord Howard is the former leader of the Conservative party and former home secretary.

  "<p>A year ago this coming Monday James (Jimmy) Wilson Vincent Savile <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/oct/29/jimmy-savile-dies-aged-84http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/oct/29/jimmy-savile-dies-aged-84\">died aged 84</a>. In life, over a period spanning decades, the Leeds-born and bred celebrity is now accused of committing a massive con-exercise on the public.</p> <p>Support for numerous charities and good causes, including the Leeds General Infirmary in his home city, led many to consider him eccentric, but with a good heart. Such was the respect people had for him that he was given what amounted to a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/nov/08/jimmy-savile-coffin-public-display\">lying in state </a>at the Queen's Hotel in Leeds, with 5,000 mourners passing his coffin before his burial on a Scarborough hilltop.</p> <p>A year on, that legacy has turned into one of trauma and destruction. As police investigate the sickening possibility that he led a double life, involved in repeated child abuse, Scotland Yard has said that<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/25/jimmy-savile-sexual-assault-complaints-alive\"> it is investigating</a> around 300 potential cases. Across the country, men and women have come forward to tell heart-wrenching stories of times when on public property, including that of the BBC and the National Health Service, Savile allegedly abused some of the most vulnerable children in society in the knowledge that that same society was unlikely to believe their word against his. </p> <p>At the time of his death, the <em>Guardian</em>'s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/oct/29/sir-jimmy-savile\">obituary noted:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Many considered that there was something strange about Savile. His enthusiasm for spending quite so much time in the hospital environment had a touch of the macabre about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>This comment goes to the heart of the case: that while rumour and speculation existed, Savile had done enough to ensure that those who had their concerns did not feel they had sufficient evidence to make public accusations of the kind that, with hindsight, they should have made. </p> <p>Coupled with the scarring of lives, the affair risks a loss of public trust in that cherished institution, the BBC. So loved that we know it as Auntie, it now faces questions over the future of its new director general, George Entwistle, and the chair of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten. The issue has spread to the <em>New York Times</em> and <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/ny-times-public-editor-calls-incoming-ceo-thompson-060009630--finance.html\">the role of Mark Thompson</a>, appointed as the paper's chief executive just last month, who was the BBC's director general at the time of the issue of whether Newsnight should or should not have televised its investigation into Savile. </p> <p>The Culture Secretary, Maria Miller, has <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/64170/letter_from_culture_secretary_maria_miller_to_bbc_trust_chair_lord_patten.html\">raised \"real concerns\" </a>about the loss of \"public trust and confidence in the BBC\" and this leads to the wider point. The Corporation is not the first public institution in current and recent times to lose the confidence of the public that it is there to serve. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2012-10-22a.719.0&amp;s=speaker:11814\">debate over Hillsborough</a> in the House of Commons on Monday reminded many of the difficult questions being asked of senior serving police officers, leading to<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/24/norman-bettison-resigns-hillsborough-west-yorkshire\"> the resignation this week </a>of Sir Norman Bettison as chief constable of West Yorkshire. The Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, found himself apologising in the same debate for the errors identified in the Hillsborough report in the way that another cherished institution, the National Health Service, responded to the disaster.</p> <p>Add to that the sapping of confidence in the banking system following a meltdown which had its roots in the 1980s culture of making a fast buck; an MPs' expenses scandal which developed over many years as politicians of all parties were encouraged to increase their expenses so that their wages could be kept down to avoid public opprobrium; and the loss of a substantial amount of public trust and confidence in the press, as the Leveson Inquiry has unearthed all sorts of skeletons in closets. Is the sum of these a perfect storm?</p> <p>Our politicians, elected to govern; our media, called upon to tell truth to power; our police, in place uphold the law; and our banks, in which many had trusted to protect their savings, have one by one found themselves undermined by events many years in the making.</p> <p>As a child born in the mid-1980s I have no recollection of much of those origins; but what does seem increasingly clear is that there was a culture, something within a number of our public services, that seemed to accept police colluding to denigrate fans crushed to death at a football match; to ignore the likely consequences of celebrities using their sex appeal with children; and to think that getting stinking rich by risking everything was OK. </p> <p>Once we truly get to the heart of both Hillsborough and Savile, and justice in those individual cases is done, a much bigger argument therefore awaits us. What was it with society then? How could so many of our public and financial institutions have failed in the way that they did? And most importantly, have we changed sufficiently to make it impossible for such events to occur again?</p> <p>As a nation and as a society we must learn the lessons so that those fundamental pillars of democracy \u2013 Parliament, the press, the police and financial institutions - can once again be held in the esteem that should be theirs. </p> <p><em><em><strong>Ed Jacobs</strong> is a political consultant at the&#xa0;Leeds based&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.publicaffairsco.com/\">Public Affairs Company</a>&#xa0;and devolution correspondent for the centre-left political and policy blog,&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.leftfootforward.org/\">Left Foot Forward</a>. </em></em></p>",
  "<p>Chinese authorities have blocked the Chinese website of the New York Times and most access to the main website after it revealed that the extended family of premier <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html \">Wen Jiabao has controlled assets worth at least $2.7bn</a> (\u00a31.67bn). </p> <p>Several of Wen's close relatives have become extremely wealthy since his ascent to the top leadership, the news organisation said. But in many cases their holdings were obscured by layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, colleagues or business partners.</p> <p>A single investment held on paper by Wen's 90-year-old mother Yang Zhiyun - a retired schoolteacher - was worth $120m five years ago, the Times said. It added it was unclear if Yang was aware of the holdings in her name.</p> <p>The report is embarrassing not only for Wen himself - who comes from a modest background and is widely seen as the sympathetic, populist face of the government - but for the party. It is the latest in a string of unwelcome revelations about the vast wealth amassed by those around senior leaders.</p> <p>Authorities blocked the Bloomberg website earlier this year after it exposed the multi-million dollar <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/29/china-bloomberg-xi-jinping \">assets held by the extended family of Xi Jinping</a>, heir-apparent to the presidency. The news agency has also reported that relatives of disgraced politician Bo Xilai accumulated at least $136m in assets.</p> <p>Many people - particularly among the elite - had been aware of rumours about relatives of Wen. But the full detail of the report and the scale of their assets is striking. The timing is also sensitive, given that the once-a-decade leadership transition is weeks away. </p> <p>But the blocking of the websites and censorship on Chinese microblogs means that many may remain unaware of the Times account.</p> <p>Several users commented on the report on the Sina Weibo service, but the remarks were quickly deleted. A BBC news report was blacked out in Beijing as it referred to the article.</p> <p>Wen has repeatedly stressed the need to curb corruption, urging leaders to ensure their families and associates do not abuse government influence, and pushed for officials to disclose the assets of their immediate families. </p> <p>Such declarations are not made public and the Times said four-fifths of the assets they found were held by relatives such as his mother, younger brother and various in-laws - none of whom would be covered by the party rules.</p> <p>A former government colleague of Wen's, who spoke anonymously, told the Times: \"In the senior leadership, there's no family that doesn't have these problems...His enemies are intentionally trying to smear him by letting this leak out.\"</p> <p>A US diplomatic cable obtained by Wikileaks, dating from 2007, quoted an executive in Shanghai as saying: \"Wen is disgusted with his family's activities, but is either unable or unwilling to curtail them.\" </p> <p>In March, the prime minister made a point of telling reporters at his annual press conference that he had \"never pursued personal gain\", adding that while he had faced criticism, \"history will have the final say\". </p> <p>Wen's mother's shares, and those of other relatives, were held via an investment vehicle, Taihong, run by a wealthy businesswoman close to Wen's wife. Duan Weihong told the Times that the investments were actually her own but she had sought a low profile so asked relatives to find other people to hold the shares on her behalf; they had by \"accident\" and without her knowledge chosen the prime minister's relatives. </p> <p>Wen's wife Zhang Beili, who is rarely seen with her husband, works in the diamond trade. Their son Winston Wen runs New Horizon Capital, now one of China's biggest private equity funds. </p> <p>His wife Yang Xiaomeng told the Times: \"Everything that has been written about him has been wrong.</p> <p>\"He's really not doing that much business anymore.\"</p> <p>The Times said the Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the investments, the prime minister or his relatives.
