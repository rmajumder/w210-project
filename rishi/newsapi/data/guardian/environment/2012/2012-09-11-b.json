  "<p>George Monbiot presents persuasive arguments that our diets can cause Alzheimer's disease (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/10/alzheimers-junk-food-catastrophic-effect\" title=\"\">This could be junk food's most catastrophic impact</a>, 11 September). Diet plays a role, but the picture is more complicated than he suggests.</p> <p>The causes of Alzheimer's are complex and still being unravelled. Its incidence is increasing as people live longer, including in countries with healthier diets than the UK. This tells us there are many things to take into account. While diet can affect the risk of developing this disease, other factors including genes, environment and life events are important too.</p> <p>Alzheimer's Research UK has a diverse \u00a318.5m research programme, including studies into the links between diet, diabetes and Alzheimer's. We still need significant and sustained investment in research, by charities and government.<br><strong>Simon Ridley</strong><br><em>Alzheimer's Research UK</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008George Monbiot rightly demonstrates concern around obesity levels and the impact this could have on the development of chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's. UK food and drink manufacturers are keen to do their part to improve public health and have shown leadership in this debate, demonstrating that voluntary action really can deliver in many key areas such as nutrition labelling, reformulation and innovation.</p> <p>But Mr Monbiot's claim that evidence suggests obesity is driven by similar forms of addiction to drugs and alcohol is unfounded. A <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v13/n4/full/nrn3212.html\" title=\"\">comprehensive review this year by scientists at Cambridge, published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience</a>, concluded there was an absence of good evidence to support an addiction model for overeating and consequent obesity.</p> <p>Complex problems like obesity require a wide range of interventions and the involvement of many interested parties to drive real changes in behaviour. Shared responsibility is the founding principle of the Department of Health's Responsibility Deal. Through the deal, UK food and drink manufacturers are working in partnership with government, NGOs and others to tackle the complex causes of obesity and poor public health. The Responsibility Deal is an important part of the UK food manufacturing industry's commitment to achieving responsible and sustainable economic growth. <br><strong>Barbara Gallani</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.fdf.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Food&#xa0;and Drink Federation</em></a></p> <p>\u2022\u2008When it comes to alternatives to nudging, Lord Krebs is stuck in the old policy rut, where a government's only options are education, regulation and taxation (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/05/lord-krebs-government-nudge-tactics\" title=\"\">Coalition nudge tactics 'not society's panacea'</a>, 6 September). Other options exist to tackle the obesity epidemic. First, it is possible to reformulate popular foods, gradually reducing their fat, sugar and calorie content. Second, it is possible to make them cheaper than standard alternatives. After the pasty tax fiasco, the lesson is clear: instead of taxing \"bad\" foods, make \"good\" foods cost less.</p> <p>At present, healthier options often cost more because companies charge a \"health premium\". They reason that the nutritionally aware, usually affluent, will pay more for foods they think will do them good. This is nutritional extortion. Cutting excessive margins would give consumers an economic incentive to choose healthier options. \"Corporate social responsibility\" for food companies should now be defined as: make the healthy choice the cheaper choice.</p> <p>For 30 years, British governments of both colours have been exhorting people to make \"informed healthy choices\". That educational strategy has failed. We keep getting fatter and fatter. It is time to get out of the rut, to do something different. Krebs is right that nudging will never suffice. Nutrition policy for the future requires a combination of product reformulation and incentive pricing.<br><strong>Jack Winkler</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008The growing evidence that academies have patchy nutrition standards is shameful (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/10/junk-food-academy-schools-claims\" title=\"\">Academies bring banned junk food back to school meals</a>, 10 September). Cynics might say this provides a natural experiment: let's see which schools perform better \u2013 junk versus better food. But this is an experiment the British have been running for a century or more. I am a fan of Jamie Oliver's actions since 2005, but the struggle to improve nutrition standards began in 1980 when the Thatcher government abolished them. Far from fighting over health standards, school meals now ought to be aspiring to full dietary sustainability, linking health, environment, social values and economy. That's the 21st-century challenge.<br><strong>Tim Lang</strong><br><em>Professor of food policy, City University</em></p>",
  "<p>Whenever you are promised the \"time of your life\", one of two things can happen. First, and most likely, it will fail to fulfil your expectations and leave you a bit disappointed. Alternatively, you could actually have the best time of your life and then be forced to live out your remaining years trying and failing to replicate that happiness until you are an old man dribbling incoherently about his youth to a nurse as she tries to spoon cold porridge into your toothless fizzog.</p> <p>Freshers' week is one of the former occasions: I can confidently predict that all incoming undergraduates will go on to have better times. Nevertheless, this week tens of thousands of supple-livered youngsters will arrive at university halls expecting seven days of parties, alcohol and sex, while overlooking the inevitable collateral damage of encountering idiots, exhaustion and the unwanted advances of beery-breathed perverts. In an attempt to temper expectations, here is a tiny selection of the worst things I faced in freshers' week and, in my senior honours wisdom, my advice to combat them.</p> <h2><strong>Introductions</strong></h2> <p><strong>The problem </strong>Introducing yourself in freshers' week can quickly become a dull affair. After a few hours, you will have heard the questions \"what do you study?\" and \"where are you from?\" so many times that you will no longer be able to differentiate them from your own constant internal screaming.</p> <p><strong>The solution</strong> You'll meet hundreds of people during the week, most of whom you'll either not see or actively hide from until graduation. Relax, find the most tolerable people and remember that it is better to remain silent and be thought dull than to discuss the intricate details of your gap year and remove all doubt.</p> <h2><strong>Drinking games</strong></h2> <p><strong>The problem</strong> If you're anything like me, your stomach has roughly the same capacity as a mouse's shoe. As such, you cannot down any significant volume of liquid and, one evening, this may cause a group of men in rugby shirts to incorporate your name into a withering chant.</p> <p><strong>The solution</strong> Take the stance that competitive drinking games are a pathetic method of alpha-male posturing, which only the worst kind of person could possibly be impressed by. You'd still secretly prefer to be good at them, obviously, but this allows you to conceal that desire with an impressive display of disdainful superiority.</p> <h2><strong>Freshers' flu</strong></h2> <p><strong>The problem</strong> Having to live in halls with a group of teenagers staying away from home for the first time is more of a cruel test of your stamina than an acceptable living environment. You will quickly succumb to illness due to a combination of filth, international germs and eating nothing but crisps.</p> <p><strong>The solution</strong> Stock up on multivitamins and don't let the spectre of braying public-school boys persuade you to go out when you don't want to. Additionally, in the first few weeks of term, don't leave the flat without antibacterial hand-gel. Or, depending on how much you don't want to become ill, you can follow my top freshers' week tip: never touch anyone.</p> <h2><strong>Sex</strong></h2> <p><strong>The problem </strong>You will become drunk and touch someone.</p> <p><strong>The solution</strong> Few people meet their soulmate in freshers' week, so have as much or as little sex as your conscience and alcohol-induced impotence allows. But do remember that the more one-night stands you have, the higher the percentage of the student populus who will avoid eye-contact with you for the next three years.</p> <h2><strong>Money</strong></h2> <p><strong>The problem </strong>You come to the end of freshers' week and, after spending all your money on blue WKD and giant hats, which seemed funny at the time, you are penniless. You ask your parents for some money, but they have spent their life savings on your tuition fees.</p> <p><strong>The solution</strong> Overthrow the government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396021495\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/5/22/1337679637344/Guardian-students-sign-up-001.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian students sign up banner\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian students sign up banner</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>Further details have emerged of how the constituency office of the new Conservative chairman Grant Shapps altered his Wikipedia biography to remove references to embarrassing political gaffes, the marketing website he founded and his personal fortune.</p> <p>Using a series of anonymous accounts which can be traced to the Tory chairman's computers, references were deleted about his role in a 2007 byelection in west London where <a href=\"http://www.bloggerheads.com/archives/2007/07/grant_shapps/\" title=\"\">he impersonated Liberal Democrats online</a> in an attempt to discredit his rivals \u2013 but forgot that he had logged on as himself.</p> <p>The campaign was notable as Shapps was then a vice-chair of the Tory party responsible for campaigning. The Tory candidate came third when many felt he was favourite to win. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grant_Shapps&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=216008108\">However, the episode was airbrushed away on the online encyclopaedia.</a></p> <p>In another series of changes after the 2010 election, Shapps's entry removed references to the company HowToCorp, which the Guardian has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/07/google-blacklists-websites-grant-shapps-family?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">exposed for breaching Google's code of conduct</a>, and to his online pseudonym Michael Green \u2013 with a comment posted that this mention of his \"alter ego\" was linked to a diary item that was an \"unreliable source\".</p> <p>Gone too were links to sites which revealed the Welwyn Hatfield MP paid back \u00a33.79 during the expenses scandal, replaced by glowing references to a Daily Telegraph piece describing him as an \"expenses saint\".</p> <p>The revelations come after it emerged that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/08/grants-shapps-altered-wikipedia-entry?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Shapps had changed his entry</a> in the online encyclopedia to correct the number of O-levels he obtained. He had also inserted testimony to his \"influential\" work on homelessness.</p> <p>Shapps, who took over as Tory party chairman last week, also erased a Wikipedia paragraph referring to donations to his office while he was shadow housing minister. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2200536/Top-Tory-airbrushed-Wikipedia-page-new-chairman-deleted-political-gaffes-altered-exam-details.html#ixzz26BPuwlcI\" title=\"\">He told the Daily Mail</a>: \"These days when I see stuff that's blatantly wrong on my Wiki page, I just shrug my shoulders. If people want to claim I'm a Jehovah's Witness, agnostic or crashed a car into a school wall \u2013 all real edits I'd previously changed \u2013 then I just leave them to it.\"</p> <p>The changes have not gone unnoticed. In May 2010, there appears a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Hackneymarsh\" title=\"\">bizarre spat with another Wiki contributor, Widefox,</a> over claims that Shapps was a member of the Freemasons. A spokesman for Shapps said he was not a member of the group.</p> <p>Wikipedia says contributors seeking to amend entries should submit a request for an edit rather than <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest\" title=\"\">editing directly</a>. Its code of practice says that \"editing Wikipedia with a conflict of interest is strongly discouraged\".</p> <p>Contributors to Wikipedia, which is run by volunteers, have noticed that Shapps appears to be editing his own entries. One administrator named <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:217.155.38.72\" title=\"\">Earle warns Shapps says that if he continues</a> to \"create a conflict of interest situation, administrative sanctions may result\".</p> <p>A volunteer media contact for Wikipedia said he could not comment on this case but \"in general, if someone is really pushing it, they might end up blocked from editing\".</p> <p>Sources close to Shapps emphasised that the four usernames \u2013 217.155.38.72, 90.196.154.2, Historyset and Hackneymarsh \u2013 could only be linked to \"computers in the constituency office of the Tory chairman\".</p> <p>A Conservative party spokesman said: \"Contributors to Wikipedia are encouraged to remove immediately any contentious material about a living person that is unsourced or poorly sourced.</p> <p>\"Individuals are also free to monitor the information that is available about them online \u2013 particularly when this information is purposefully vandalised by others.</p> <p>\"This is absolutely not in breach of Wikipedia rules \u2013 and it is completely false to suggest that Wikipedia have contacted Grant in this regard.\"</p> <p>Labour MP Steve McCabe MP told the Guardian that the Tory chairman \"seems to have more imaginary personalities than Walter Mitty\".</p> <p>\"This latest imbroglio is reducing the current Tory Party Chairman to a farcical figure.

  "<p>US politicians came under renewed pressure to resolve a dispute over $1.2tn worth of spending cuts and tax increases after the ratings agency Moody's said it would probably cut its AAA rating if negotiations fail before a 1 January deadline.</p> <p>As the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, warned that the global economy was burdened by the US's huge debts, Moody's ratcheted up the pressure on Congress to prevent the \"fiscal cliff\" from sending the economy into a nosedive next year.</p> <p>A failure to strike a deal by the new year will allow time-limited tax breaks and spending commitments first implemented by former president George W Bush to lapse. Barack Obama has already extended the tax breaks but has refused to back them in the run-up to the presidential election.</p> <p>Democrats argue that the package includes huge concessions to the wealthiest 1% and that they have widened the income and wealth gap during the recovery from the financial crisis. But Republicans have refused to make concessions that would maintain the tax breaks for middle-income families while excluding the richest groups.</p> <p>John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said he was not confident Congress could reach a budget deal and avoid the downgrading. He said the Senate needed to act and President Obama needed to show \"leadership\". Any real negotiations are not expected until after the November presidential elections.</p> <p>A year ago, Moody's cut its outlook on US debt to \"negative,\" which acts as a warning that it might downgrade the rating after partisan wrangling over raising the government borrowing limit almost triggered a default.</p> <p>Rival agency Standard &amp; Poor's took the drastic step of stripping the government of its AAA rating on its bonds around the same time. Fitch Ratings issued a warning of potential downgrade.</p> <p>In its report on Tuesday Moody's noted that the government will probably reach the debt limit again by the end of the year, which means another round of negotiations in Congress on raising the limit if the government is to keep paying its bills.</p> <p>\"Under these circumstances, the government's rating would likely be placed under review after the debt limit is reached, but several weeks before the exhaustion of the Treasury's resources,\" the Moody's analyst Steven A Hess said in his report.</p> <p>Despite the rating cut last year from S&amp;P and the warnings from Moody's and Fitch, the government has been able to continue borrowing at very low rates.</p> <p>Investors see the US as a haven from economic turmoil in Europe and uncertainty in other parts of the world.</p>",
  "<p>Bill Clinton, less than a week after his triumphant appearance in front of the Democratic national convention, began a tour of battleground states across the US in a bid to help Barack Obama win re-election to the White House.</p> <p>In response to a request from Obama for help, Clinton promised to campaign alongside the president as well as on his own.</p> <p>The former president was scheduled to follow up appearances in Florida on Tuesday and Wednesday with trips to Iowa, Ohio, Nevada, New Hampshire and Wisconsin. He has also promised to help with fundraising. </p> <p>Obama's request for help contrasts with Al Gore in 2000 who famously rejected Clinton's help, wanting to win on his own, and lost.<br> Republican strategists last week praised Clinton after an old-fashioned barnstorming speech to the convention, with one saying the former president had won the election for Obama. </p> <p>Republican challenger Mitt Romney said in an interview on Sunday that Clinton had \"elevated\" the Democratic convention and mischievously contrasted Obama's performance unfavourably with the former president.<br>Clinton was due to speak in Miami before heading for another speech in Orlando today. </p> <p>He is capable of firing up parts of the Democratic base that have proved resistant to Obama, particularly white, working-class males.</p> <p>He made some appearances in the 2008 campaign to help boost Obama, but he failed to work his magic campaigning for Democratic candidates in the 2010 mid-term Congressional elections in which the Democrats were trounced.<br> Clinton's intervention comes as polls show Obama appears to have gained more from the party conventions than Romney. After months in which the two have been neck-and-neck, Obama opened up a six-point lead among registered voters in an ABC/Washington Post poll published Monday, putting him on 50% to Romney's 44%. That lead had to be tempered by the findings among likely voters, which showed the two tied.</p> <p>A CNN/ORC International poll the previous day also suggested Obama secured a bounce from the Democratic convention, putting him at 52% compared to 46% for Romney.</p> <p>Clinton was involved in bad-tempered exchanges during the 2008 fractious fight for the party's presidential nomination between Hillary Clinton and Obama. The former president was scathing about Obama during the primaries and caucuses, leaving a bad feeling between the Obama and Clinton camps that have lingered until now.</p> <p>Obama and Clinton chatted backstage together during the convention, and the former president agreed to do more campaign events.</p> <p>Relations between the Clinton and Obama camps have improved in part because Hillary Clinton has proven to be a loyal secretary of state, with no leaks or hints of criticism of the White House coming from her office in almost four years.</p> <p>She is due to stand down soon after the election, saying she is exhausted. She is planning to write her memoirs of her time the state department but not about her acrimonious battles with Obama for the Democratic nomination.</p> <p>She has emerged as favourite to be the Democratic nominee for the White House in 2016. It might be easier for her to follow an Obama presidency, given economic predictions that recovery should be well underway by then, than Romney seeking a second term, getting credit for any economic improvements. </p> <p>Apart from his new campaign commitments, Clinton will host his annual conference for his foundation, Global Initiative, which gives millions of dollars to the developing world.</p> <p>Both Obama and Romney are to speak at the conference in New York later this month.</p> <p>An Obama fundraising dinner is planned for London next week hosted by, among others, Vogue editor Anna Wintour and actress Gwyneth Paltrow, according to the US-based Sunlight Foundation which tracks campaign funding. </p> <p>The foundation said the 19 September dinner, at Mark's Club in Mayfair, is seeking contributions of between $15,000 and $40,000 to attend.</p>",
  "<p>American influence on the world stage is being sapped by widespread distrust of US intentions, not just in the Middle East and south Asia but also among traditional European allies, according to a survey of global opinions.</p> <p>Suspicion of America outweighed faith in its good intentions by large margins in the Arab world and Pakistan, and even its heavyweight European ally Germany was more sceptical than trusting, a YouGov survey found. British and French opinion was more positive but still deeply divided.</p> <p>Negative Arab and Pakistani perceptions of America as overweening and untrustworthy clearly pose a daunting foreign policy challenge for the Obama administration. The fact that 78% of Pakistanis questioned by YouGov said they did not trust America to act responsibly underlines Washington's serious lack of soft power in the region as it attempts to extricate itself from Afghanistan.</p> <p>Attitudes towards the US in the Arab world were nearly as negative. Those respondents in the Middle East and north Africa who said they trusted America were outnumbered by more than two to one by those who said they did not, and 39% said they did not trust America at all.</p> <p>The results suggest that Arab antipathy arising from the Iraq invasion and US support for Israel has not been softened by Obama's military withdrawal from Iraq, US support for the Arab spring and the relatively low-profile US role in the Libyan and Syrian conflicts.</p> <p>Perhaps just as worrying for Washington is the lukewarm support among western European allies. More Germans questioned in the YouGov survey voiced misgivings than trust in the US. Perhaps surprisingly, in view of past wariness, French opinion was somewhat warmer: just over half of the French poll respondents trusted America, against 40% who did not.</p> <p>The so-called special relationship between the US and Britain emerged from the survey as distinctly lopsided. There was widespread American affection for its close ally, but the sentiment was only partly requited, reflecting deep British ambivalence about America's powerful role in world affairs.</p> <p>Two-thirds of Americans questioned by YouGov said they trusted Britain to act responsibly, with 15% dissenting. The leading traits Americans attributed to the UK were a respect for human rights and \"a sensible voice in the world\". More Americans than Britons thought the UK was \"a force for good\" on the world stage.</p> <p>British perceptions seem to reflect the resentment of a junior partner in the relationship. Far more Britons than Americans saw the UK as a nation in decline, arguably showing a persistent deficit in national confidence even after the Olympics.</p> <p>When asked to select a word they associated with America, a striking 40% of the British respondents chose \"bullying\", a greater proportion than in any other country or region covered by the survey. Only 12% thought the US was defined by its respect for human rights. Half of British respondents said they trusted America, and 41% said they did not.</p> <p>There was a plurality in all the countries surveyed that foreign military intervention in Syria would make the situation there worse or have no impact. Opposition to such a move was most pronounced in Pakistan, and it was also prevalent in the Middle East and north Africa, where 40% of respondents said intervention would make matters worse, compared with 33% who said it would make things better. Six per cent said it would make no difference.</p> <p>Among western countries, opposition to armed intervention was most entrenched in Britain, where the balance was 37% in favour and 21% against, with 12% saying it would have no impact. In the US, those for and against were more or less even (20% and 22%), but outnumbered by the 47% who said they simply did not know.</p> <h2>Sex, work and morality</h2> <p>French attitudes towards women who prioritise their careers over starting a family are a touch kinder than those in the Middle East, but a touch harsher than those in Pakistan, according to the polling.</p> <p>Britons defended it as \"a morally acceptable choice\" by a 72%-6% margin, and Germans and Americans were also emphatic, but France was far more evenly divided: 30% deemed it acceptable to postpone parenthood in these circumstances, as against 27% who thought the reverse.</p> <p>In Pakistan, by contrast, the support was by a more decisive 42%-27% margin.&#xa0;Only in the Middle East and north Africa did the suggestion run into more opposition than in France, with respondents rejecting it by a margin of 49% to 22%.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the survey on questions of gender and sexual morality, opinion breaks down in more predictable ways, with liberalism prevailing in irreligious Europe, conservatism exerting more of a grip in the Muslim world, and the partially devout US occupying an intermediate position. On contraception, pornography and gay marriage the same pattern is found, as indeed it is on abortion, where France was by far the most pro-choice.</p> <p>In one other respect, France was an outlier. A minority of the French said it was always wrong for a married man (49%) or indeed woman (44%) to have an affair, whereas the majority everywhere else that YouGov surveyed said it was always immoral.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396011717\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/11/1347382845154/YouGov-polls-001.png\" alt=\"YouGov polls\" width=\"460\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">YouGov polls Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Democracy v economy</h2> <p>The case for democracy is coming perilously close to being lost around the world, the poll reveals. In Pakistan and to a lesser extent across the Middle East and north Africa, respondents told YouGov that they thought a strong economy was more important than a system of government based on democracy. In Pakistan, the prioritising of growth over democracy was emphatic, by 71% to 22%. In a cross-border Middle Eastern sample of the online population \u2013 including Egypt, Tunisia and Libya \u2013 economic strength trumped democratic governance by 44% to 41%.</p> <p>Perhaps more surprising is the nonchalant attitude towards democracy shown in some of the states that have enjoyed it for longest. Both France and the US were split down the middle on whether the economy or democracy should come first, with a 41%-41% divide in both nations. Britain's enthusiasm for its democracy was a little more emphatic: it was seen as the priority by 46%, against 38% who would put the economy first.&#xa0;</p> <p>Only Germany was resolute in prioritising the political system. By 52% to 35%, German voters told YouGov that democracy had to come first.</p> <p>\u2022 YouGov questioned 12,693 adults across the US, Britain, Europe, the Middle East and north Africa, Pakistan and China between 10-25 August 2012. Data was weighted to be nationally representative of adult populations in Britain, US, France, Germany and the US; elsewhere it was representative of the online population.</p>",
  "<p>The brief period in which go-go Burberry was worth more than dowdy Marks &amp; Spencer is over, at least for a while. Burberry's stock market fans have learned an uncomfortable fact: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/11/burberry-warns-profits-sales-luxury-fashion\" title=\"\">the rich aren't buying expensive frocks, coats and handbags like they used to</a>. Same-store sales have been falling in recent weeks. Cue a 21% plunge in the share price.</p> <p>The fan club was warned but didn't listen. In her July update, chief executive Angela Ahrendts made all the usual boasts about strong \"brand momentum\" but also included the dreadful phrase \"a more challenging external environment.\" That should have caused the highl rated shares to stall. Instead, they climbed 15% higher over the course of the next month. Bizarre. Investors, it seems, are slow to let go of the happy notion that wealthy Chinese consumers are God's gift to European luxury goods retailers.</p> <p>As it happens, Burberry thinks the weakness in its sales extends well beyond China - the rest of Asia, Europe and the Americas are all affected. If anything, that's more alarming for immediate prospects since global trends are harder to buck than regional ones.</p> <p>If a proper storm now follows, there is a limit to how far Burberry can protect itself. Staff have been to told to curb their international travel and rein in publicity jollies (the poor dears). But the heavy corporate expenditure is on stores and it's too late now to cancel plans to expand space by 13% this year, including the addition of big new shops in London's Regent Street, Chicago and Hong Kong.</p> <p>But perhaps Ahrendts wouldn't wish to anyway. She's shifted sales from the fiddly wholesale channel to flagship retail shops, and the formula is clearly right for the long term. But it means there is little alternative but to ride out the storm. The company thinks it can still hit the low end of City forecasts for pre-tax profits of \u00a3407m this year (up from \u00a3376m a year ago). But it's the following two years, when the City is still expecting steady 10% profts increases, that now look a serious struggle. We're seen this plot before: when the luxury market turns, it tends to turn sharply.</p>",
  "<p>Reputations can take a lifetime to build \u2013 and an instant to pull down. That much has often been said, but it has never seemed truer than in the current age, where an unfortunate Twitpic can find its way around the world seconds after being snapped.</p> <p>The great global slump only redoubles the difficulties of hanging on to any sort of a positive reputation. Whether in business, politics or diplomacy, cuts are the currency of the hour, and they don't settle any bills in the popularity stakes.</p> <p>This year, <a href=\"http://www.yougov.polis.cam.ac.uk/?p=3396\" title=\"\">the Guardian has joined YouGov for its annual conference</a> at Cambridge University on \"reputation in the age of protest\" and the great challenges that confront any nation, organisation or political party that would like to be liked. It will examine exclusive polling that uncovers evidence the old certainties of western hegemony, the forward march of big business and the grip of political centrism are all in question.</p> <p>Blue-collar western workers worry about the China effect, while their white-collar counterparts may be fretting about India. An expanding, global middle class is newly assertive about better services and access to opportunity; farmers in developing economies insist there can be no more opening up of markets until western crops stop being subsidised. NGOs and students who ring alarm bells about the wealth gap in the west may be surprised to find that, in matters of globalisation at least, they share the cause with the European right, whose chief bogeyman is the multiculturalism bequeathed by open borders.</p> <p>If the elite in the west is going to overcome all of this, then it will have to secure some serious \"soft power\". Special YouGov polling undertaken in several countries at once \u2013 across Europe, the Middle East, China and Pakistan \u2013 allows us to gauge the progress being made in the global popularity stakes.</p> <p>Things are looking OK for Britain \u2013 which, though plagued by characteristic self-doubt about being in decline, emerges as a serious soft-power player, admired in fields from education to human rights, despite evidence of residual mistrust in the Muslim world.</p> <p>The United States, however, is in a rather different position. It is everywhere deemed the world's principal power \u2013 save for in France, where voters already give that title by a 37%-34% edge to China \u2013 but it is also true that it is everywhere expected to surrender this status soon. By crushing margins of 25 percentage points or more, respondents in Germany, Britain, Pakistan, the Middle East and North Africa all expect China to become the leading power within just 20 years. Only in the United States, and then only by a 32%-30% margin, do the public expect their own country to remain top of the pile.</p> <p>This poses an obvious challenge: if you are seen to be in decline, then you cannot expect others to follow you purely out of pragmatism. The United States might therefore do well to take care of other aspects of its reputation. Elements remain strong \u2013 in most of our countries, for example, the US remains seen as a great place to send a child for an education. But there are other areas that might once have been strengths, where the American image is becoming tarnished \u2013 such as respect for human rights: only 12% of Britons, 24% of Middle Easterners, 9% of Pakistanis, 10% of Germans and 13% of the French said this was a quality they associated with the US. Roughly equal numbers of people in the Middle East described the US and China as \"undemocratic\" (22% and 23% respectively), and significantly more described the US (33%) as \"corrupt\" than China (12%).</p> <p>Reputation is, of course, in the eye of the beholder \u2013 very much an amalgam of rational and emotional thinking \u2013 but great powers whose greatest days might just be behind them ignore it at their peril.</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> The <a href=\"http://www.yougov.polis.cam.ac.uk/?p=3396\" title=\"\">YouGov-Cambridge conference</a> takes place at Magdalene College, Cambridge University, this week. The Guardian is the media partner for the conference, and is reporting on various elements of the opinion polling presented over the course of this week.</p>",
  "<p>Germany's supreme court has long enjoyed a reputation that it is good for surprises. But its eight judges will never have felt their capacity for creating so much drama as in the run-up to a ruling they are due to deliver on Wednesday, and which could decide the future of the euro and even influence the world economy.</p> <p>The court in Karlsruhe is expected to announce whether Germany's participation in a permanent European bailout fund is in line with the country's constitution, a decision that has Angela Merkel's government on tenterhooks.</p> <p>If the court rules in favour of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the fiscal pact on countries' budget limits, then debt-ridden countries like Spain and Greece will be able to be kept afloat as part of Europe's blueprint for tackling debt contagion in the eurozone.</p> <p>If the court rules against the plan, Europe may find itself in turmoil, with markets likely to react with panic to a decision that would have the potential to topple the single currency.</p> <p>A late legal challenge by a conservative member of the German parliament was rejected by the court on Tuesday, ensuring that the judges would stick to their original plan to deliver their long-awaited verdict on the bailout.</p> <p>But most analysts agree that the judges, not wishing to go down in history as the court that brought down the German government, and the euro and plunged the world economy into gloom, are likely vote in favour of the bailout mechanism.</p> <p>\"I don't think the court will strike down the ESM, because it wouldn't like to be seen to be killing off the euro. Just as the German government doesn't have the courage to do that, neither does the court. If it ruled that the government had adopted a wrong decision, it would cause a huge crisis of legitimacy in Germany,\" said Gunnar Beck, an EU law expert at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. \"Never in the 60-year history of the court has there been an example of the court killing an essential piece of government policy.\"</p> <p>What he and other analysts believe, though, is that the court will choose a \"middle way\" \u2013 allowing the ESM to go ahead but not without insisting on tight limits and conditions that would affect the Bundestag's decision-making procedures on future aid and further European integration.</p> <p>The court's decision not to accept the last-minute appeal by the eurosceptic MP Peter Gauweiler made a positive ruling more likely, analysts said. Gauweiler, who has plenty of allies within the government, had argued that Germany should not agree to the ESM until the European Central Bank reversed its bond-buying plan announced last week, which critics say will stoke inflation and offers no incentive for debt-ridden countries to reform. Gauweiler might still refile his challenge following the rejection.</p> <p>The case was brought by 37,000 petitioners, including academics, ordinary Germans, and members of Merkel's own party. Their main concern is that their taxes are being used to prop up parts of Europe they view as irresponsibly profligate.</p> <p>All eyes are on the constitutional court president, Andreas Vossk\u00fchle, who will deliver the historical verdict at 10am local time on Wednesday. Vossk\u00fchle, a quietly spoken 48-year-old lover of abstract art who eschews the limelight, is believed to support the growing concern in Germany that too much power is being ceded to Brussels. He once said the citizens of Germany \"shouldn't one morning wake up and find out that the people they elected have nothing to decide anymore\".</p> <h2>Sch\u00e4uble chastises US borrowing</h2> <p>Not content with taking a hard line with fellow eurozone countries that get too far into debt, Germany's finance minister turned his fire on America's borrowing habit.</p> <p>In a Bundestag speech to open a debate on the 2013 budget, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said worries about US debt were a burden for the global economy and questioned how the US would deal with high levels of government debt after the November presidential election \u2013 hitting back at Washington's criticism of Europe for failing to get a grip on its own debt crisis.</p> <p>In private, German officials often express concern about US debt levels and the inability of politicians there to reach a consensus on how to reduce it, but Sch\u00e4uble's public remarks underscore the extent of the worries in Germany.</p> <p>\"Ahead of the election in the US there is great uncertainty about the course American politics will take in dealing with government debts, which are much too high,\" Sch\u00e4uble said.</p> <p>\"We need to remind ourselves of that sometimes and the global economy knows that and is burdened by it.\"</p> <p>The issue has become a central theme of the US election campaign with Republican candidate Mitt Romney accusing President Barack Obama of fiscal mismanagement.</p>",
  "<p>Ron Taylor, who has died aged 78, was a great observer and defender of sharks. He began his career earning a living as a spearfisher, and later filmed some of the most exciting sequences for Steven Spielberg's 1975 film Jaws, but then spent the rest of his life educating people about the animals he regarded as \"fascinating marine creatures\". \"There are over 360 different shark species in the world's oceans,\" he noted in an interview in 2007, \"yet only a few of those are potentially dangerous. Each one has its own characteristics. Sharks have evolved to fulfil a different niche in the marine environment.\"</p> <p>Sharks existed before the dinosaurs, and prospered for millions of years, yet during their lifetime Taylor and his wife, Valerie \u2013 an equally passionate advocate \u2013 saw them come under threat. Many are killed for their teeth, their fins \u2013 more than 70m each year go to make shark fin soup \u2013 or simply for sport. In their illuminating book, Great Shark Writings (2000, first published in 1978 as Great Shark Stories), Valerie noted that there had been, by the 1970s, only five recorded deaths caused by great white sharks in Australian waters. But there have been as many again in the past year alone. It is a situation that Ron certainly looked upon wryly, not least because of his own role in the story.</p> <p>He was born in Sydney, son of a professional photographer, and his first interest was in photography. He did not begin his career as a diver until 1952. In the late 1950s he met Valerie, another keen diver, and a talented marine artist. They married in 1963, and honeymooned at the Australian Spearfishing Championships. Ron was already filming underwater: in 1962 he made his first successful film, Shark Hunters, with scenes of grey nurse sharks being speared. Later he would persuade his wife that they were incredibly placid creatures. Increasingly aware of the damage that hunting was doing, he turned to cameras rather than spears, supplying dramatic footage for Australian television.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395995813\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347380418161/Valerie-and-Ron-Taylor-008.jpg\" alt=\"Valerie and Ron Taylor\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ron and Valerie Taylor in a scene from the film Blue Water, White Death, 1971. Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having formed their own company, the Taylors' first commercial film was a documentary, Blue Water, White Death (1971), with revealing scenes of oceanic white tip sharks. It was the first time anyone had been outside an underwater cage among feeding sharks. The scenes Ron shot \u2013 \"Ron just kept his finger on the button and span in circles,\" said Valerie \u2013 are more eerie than frightening. The beautifully hydrodynamic animals spiral inquisitively \u2013 for all that the Taylors have recourse to poking them with sticks to persuade them to keep their distance. Then, in a cloud of blood, they begin to feed on the carcass of a sperm whale, taking chunks out of its blubber.</p> <p>Ron later recalled: \"I was not put off by the fact that there were sharks swimming around me. I've only had very minor bites by sharks; none of them has actually tried to bite any lumps out; just a quick bite and the sharks let go.\"</p> <p>He observed that sharks could tell the difference between a human and a fish \"because when a shark bites a human, the shark usually lets the person go\". And he added that in most cases of fatal attack, the victim died from blood loss, rather than from being eaten: \"The truth is that most sharks ignore people \u2013 they are neither friends nor enemies.\"</p> <p>However, he did note that the great white shark investigated everything by biting. And in 1972, Valerie watched, horrified, as Ron slipped on an oily deck and into a group of sharks which they had been feeding on half a horse. He was pulled out of the water just in time, as a grey shape with \"a big black eye\" swam underneath.</p> <p>It was such scenes that drew the attention of Spielberg, whose producers sent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/feb/14/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Peter Benchley</a>'s book, Jaws, to Ron, asking him to supply suitable footage for the film. Ron replied that a 26ft specimen, as described by Benchley, was out of the question. In order to create the illusion of bigger animals, Ron made half-size cages in which a small diver, the former jockey Carl Rizzo, a \"gentle little man\", would face the beasts. However, during the filming, in the aptly named Dangerous Reef off Port Lincoln, South Australia, things went wrong.</p> <p>In a sequence vividly described in Valerie's diary, one great white managed to tear the deck, winch and cage from one of the boats, the Skippy. Two others trapped Ron in his cage, circling around it for 20 minutes. The experience left Rizzo \"frozen with shock\". But Ron had continued filming throughout. It was such real-life drama that gave the charge to the final feature film.</p> <p>In the wake of the immense publicity surrounded its release, in 1976 the Taylors agreed to take four Americans out on an expedition to see sharks on Dangerous Reef. It was their first such \"tourist\" trip. As Juliet Eilperin describes in her book Demon Fish (2011), the passengers paid $4,000 each for the pleasure: \"It's miraculous that everyone emerged unscathed from the adventure.\" As the Americans got into the water, in a cage, the sharks began to ram the cage. \"Everyone yelled and cheered,\" wrote Valerie. Unfortunately, the ensuing press coverage had the effect of drawing hunters to the reef, where they killed at least 12 sharks. Further trips were cancelled.</p> <p>For later film ventures such as the TV series Inner Space, narrated by William Shatner, the Taylors designed a mesh suit of stainless steel, although Ron found it constricting and gave it to Valerie to wear. During filming of Operation Shark Bite (1979), it saved her arm when a shark decided to chew on it \u2013 although to lure the animals she had stuffed pilchards down her suit and \"squished\" them to \"let some of the juice out\". The story was on the cover of National Geographic magazine in 1981.</p> <p>Ron also worked on Orca (1977) and Return to the Blue Lagoon (1991), as well as episodes of the children's TV series Skippy and Flipper. But the Taylors' efforts towards conservation gathered pace in the 1980s. They lobbied the Australian government to protect the Coral Sea Islands off Queensland, and their films about the wreck of the Yongala, one of the world's top diving sites, and the Great Barrier Reef proved invaluable in promoting their message.</p> <p>The Taylors were highly regarded by the international conservation community. Ken Collins, who supervises the shark-tagging programme at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, called the pair \"the gods of the shark world\". In 2003, Ron was appointed a member of the Order of Australia.</p> <p>Valerie survives him.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Ronald Josiah Taylor, marine conservationist and wildlife film-maker, born 8 March 1934; died 9 September 2012</p>",

  "<p>The role of of jihadist groups is attracting increasing scrutiny in media coverage and analysis of the Syrian uprising \u2014 giving the experts who thrived in the years after 9/11 a new lease of life. Most prominent amongst these outfits is the mysterious Jabhat al-Nusra (The front for the protection of the people of the Levant), which has claimed responsibility for suicide bombings in Damascus and Aleppo. It appears sympathetic to, if not formally affilated with, al-Qaida, though Ayman al-Zawahiri, the AQ leader, issued a rallying cry to jihadists in Syria in February this year. It publishes regular <a href=\"http://jihadology.net/2012/09/05/eight-new-statements-from-jabhat-al-nu?rah/\">statements</a> describiing its operations and mourning its martyrs. Its language is unashamedly sectarian. Organisational affiliations are often unclear, but veteran fighters have brought deadly operational experience from Iraq, as Ghaith Abdul Ahad reported vividly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/30/al-qaida-rebels-battle-syria\">here</a>. Western intelligence officials admit that they are concerned but still know little about al-Nusra and like-minded Sunni groups.</p> <p>Now a new <a href=\"http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/press-releases/quilliam-releases-concept-paper-the-jihadist-network-in-the-syrian-revolution/)\">study</a> by an unusually well-placed expert predicts that their role will become more important. Noman Benotman is at the Quilliam Foundation in London, where he is a sort of poacher-turned-gamekeeper. Benotman was a founder member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), which was formed in the mid-1990's to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi and fought with the Mujahideen in Afghanistan. Benotman knew Osama bin Laden but he other LIFG members such as Abdel-Hakim Belhadj denied being part of al-Qaida and its global struggle. Many also fought in Iraq. Under the auspices of the reformist Saif al-Islam al-Gaddafi, LIFG members participated in official de-radicalisation programmes, renounced violence and were freed from prison. Belhadj's former deputy in Tripoli, the Libyan-Irish Mahdi al-Harati, is now in Syria leading the <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/08/09/the_syrian_rebels_libyan_weapon\">Liwa al-Ummah</a> brigade.</p> <p>\"The increasing evidence of jihadist activism in Syria in recent months indicates that the uprising is moving towards a new and more radical phase,\" Benotman writes. Proportion and precision are important in the light of Syrian government propganda, which emphasises the jihadi character of the \"armed terrorist groups\" \u2014 language it started using in the first months of the uprising when the protests were still largely peaceful. Assad supporters at home and abroad tend to highlight the role of jihadi and Salafi groups, sometimes claiming that they are working with Nato \u2014 as the Libyan rebels indeed did last year. Financial support is said to come from Saudi Arabia and Qatar and elsewhere in the Gulf, though the lines are blurred between governments, religious foundations and individual donors.</p> <p>The presence of these groups, formed into a loose network, is now unquestionable. \"The overwhelming majority of fighters in the network are Syrian, with the number of foreign fighters varying between 1200-1500 members,\" Benotman says. He adds: \"In most conflicts of which they are a part, jihadist groups represent a small percentage of combatants \u2013 this holds true in the Syrian case, where they represent less than 10% of all fighters. For these groups, militant uprising is seen as an opportunity to exercise their influence in Syria; particularly as the peaceful revolutions of the Arab Spring rendered their role irrelevant in the nations' fight for freedom.\"</p>",
  "<p>There are many unanswered questions from the first episode of Being: Liverpool, the fly-on-the-wall documentary with the unnecessary colon. Why are old men sat up close as Jamie Carragher and others dissolve into hysterics while having to attend a \"relaxation and meditation\" class? Why does Brendan Rodgers have a self-portrait on his wall at home? But, most pertinently, why?</p> <p>As a free advert for The Storrsdale pub in Mossley Hill, it's right up there. As an insight into the work, organisation, sacrifice and demands required at a major English football club, it has its moments. There is something strangely absorbing about watching the Leivas, Lucas and his wife Ariana, treating fellow South Americans Luis Su\u00e1rez, Sebasti\u00e1n Coates and their families to a game of monopoly, or seeing Rodgers's unease as he reveals his 16-year-old daughter Mischa is in a relationship with the son of his assistant at Swansea and now Liverpool, Colin Pascoe. \"We don't think about it much,\" the Liverpool manager says. \"It just happened for some reason.\" Theo Pascoe, the son, has modelled for Hollister.</p> <p>Fox Sports enjoyed several months of enviable access at Liverpool, detailing the end of Kenny Dalglish's reign to the early days of Rodgers, and have produced a slick documentary on the evidence of episode one. It showcases the best of the city's architecture and doesn't shy away from its worst, some of which, in the abandoned streets around Anfield, Liverpool's decades-long delay over a new stadium is responsible for. Perhaps it was expecting too much for a similar warts-and-all treatment of the club. Hard Knocks, the HBO series into an NFL team, this is not.</p> <p>From a purely football perspective, there is plenty of emotive Liverpool imagery but not enough examples of Rodgers and his players at work. The manager's training ground instructions to the young right-back Jon Flanagan \u2013 \"Stay behind the ball. You're not the one bombing on for fun, Cafu\" \u2013 are a rare example. Hopefully this will come as the series advances into the season.</p> <p>But then, as becomes clear, this is not really about the inner-workings of a football club, but everything to do with promoting Liverpool in a glossy, Hello! magazine style to a global (particularly American) audience. And so we get a good nose around the extravagant homes of Rodgers and Steven Gerrard, the Liverpool captain being described by the narrator Clive Owen as the winner of \"two FA Cup titles\" \u2013 what about the rest? \u2013 introductions to their families and Gerrard discussing the \"due diligence\" process of securing a first date with his future wife.</p> <p>Plenty of toe-curling results from Being: Liverpool and, football being football, the documentary makes Rodgers, the chairman, Tom Werner, and principal owner, John W Henry, hostage to fortune at a time when they could all do without it.</p> <p>We get this from Rodgers on Andy Carroll, subsequently loaned to West Ham United for a \u00a31m fee with no guaranteed transfer at the end of the season; \"It's going to take something incredible for him to leave the football club. I think people have looked at it and think maybe he can't play in this style in which I would want to play, but I think that's a little bit unfair.\"</p> <p>Explaining the sacking of Dalglish, Henry claims: \"When we first talked with Kenny about coming in, he understood and we understood that at some point there was going to be a time where he was going to step aside when we found the right person for the long term. And he said to me in the first conversation we had that he would be ready for that.\" As Henry says, \"in the first conversation we had\", that is, when Dalglish was asked to replace Roy Hodgson on a caretaker basis and not when he was subsequently awarded a three-year contract as permanent manager.</p> <p>Television's need for the catchy sound-bite puts Rodgers in dangerous David Brent territory on occasion. The episode's title \"The Silver Shovel\" is taken from the manager's description of his upbringing in Carnlough. \"Player plus environment equals behaviour\" is another line from a manager who, away from the cameras, has consistently spoken in clear, refreshingly realistic terms about the task confronting himself and Liverpool. He needed a few extra million to sign Clint Dempsey to help that cause, not this.</p> <p>For the Hello!-reading Liverpool fan, this will be a treat. For those struggling with Henry's \"vision\" for Liverpool, who question why the club have promoted the documentary on the eve of the release of the Hillsborough papers (Fox's scheduling demands), it is another reason to go to The Storrsdale.</p> <p><em>Being: Liverpool begins on Fox on 16 September and will be shown in Britain on Channel 5 from 21 September</em></p>",

  "<h2>Frances O'Grady: 'The worry is we've heard this before'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395994826\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/25/1343230313175/FrancesOGrady.jpg\" alt=\"Frances O'Grady\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Brendan Barber's keynote speech to the TUC said that policymakers should learn the economic lessons of the Olympics: government can pick winners, invest and plan for growth. So <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2012/Sep/cable-outlines-vision-for-future-british-industry\" title=\"\">today's speech</a> from the business secretary, Vince Cable, is certainly welcome. Unlike some members of the coalition he understands that, to generate growth and drive up living standards, there is a lot more that government can do than simply getting out of the way.</p> <p>Cable is right that Britain needs a modern industrial policy, something neglected by governments in Britain for much of the last 30 years. His comments on supporting key sectors and reforming procurement rules are steps in the right direction. By setting a strategic direction and using its power as the biggest actor in the economy to support British business, the state can help to shape the direction of the economy.</p> <p>But the worry is that we've heard this before. The business secretary is right to be looking at the case for a British business bank, but his proposals lack detail and may just amount to a rebranding of some existing programmes. The government has been talking about a growth plan for two years; it's time they got on with it. We need to build a new economy, one that is balanced, sustainable and works for ordinary people. Achieving that will mean an active role for government.</p> <p>And while Vince Cable may be moving in the right direction, business does not simply face credit problems. It needs confident public and private customers, and that's up to the chancellor.</p> <p>\u2022 Frances O'Grady is the TUC's general secretary elect</p> <h2>Aditya Chakrabortty: 'Today's speech is full of holes'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395994827\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/6/8/1307529997306/Aditya-Chakrabortty.jpg\" alt=\"Aditya\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For most of the past three decades, the merest suggestion of the need for a British industrial strategy would get you rubbished by politicians of all main parties. The result has been to leave Britain occupying a disastrous niche: we are the only major economy not to have an industrial strategy; the only G8 country not to have a national investment institution (yes, that includes the US) and now virtually the only advanced economy not to have a serious regional development policy.It's against that background that we should read today's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/11/vince-cable-laissez-faire-work?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">speech by Vince Cable</a>. As I've been asked to keep it brief, I'll make three brief points.</p> <p>1. It's big. Here you have a cabinet minister who just a few years ago wanted to scrap the DTI, now in charge of its successor department \u2013 and taking his first steps towards establishing an industrial strategy. This is a major advance \u2013 especially in the context of a Conservative-led coalition that has spent most of the past couple of years thinking that the way to encourage businesses was to blah on about \"attitude\" and the need to cut red tape.</p> <p>2. It's not big enough. Today's speech is full of holes; the government admits as much. How much money might any of this cost \u2014 and where will it come from? Which sectors do the coalition think are worth developing and why? Cable is very weak here, using catch-alls like \"advanced manufacturing and \"knowledge-intensive services\". And, the biggest question of all, what is an industrial policy for? I would say that one of the highest priorities of any such strategy ought to be creating good new jobs, but Cable's speech made scant reference to employment.</p> <p>3. Other nations are thinking bigger. Spain has picked out key sectors to develop to rebuild itself after the housing crash. Japan has done that \u2014 and been thinking about how to direct monetary policy to these new industries. One of the things that helped the SNP take Holyrood at the last elections was its rhetoric about how to reorient the North Sea oil industry towards developing green energy. But from Westminster, we have an interesting speech delivered over lunch that highlights some intriguing new policy directions \u2013 and possible lines of conflict within the coalition. It's nowhere near enough.</p> <p>Look, I don't know want to knock today's announcement: it's sunny out, and I respect Vince Cable and his team. Besides, a serious consideration of the need for an industrial strategy is to be encouraged. But all this timid step shows is the vastness of the ground Britain has to make up.</p> <p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is the Guardian's economics leader writer</p> <h2>John Cridland: 'We need a renewed emphasis on specific sectors'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395994828\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/10/3/1317635739600/John-Cridland-003.jpg\" alt=\"John Cridland\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">  Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vince Cable says he's planning a government-backed bank to increase lending to businesses. When it comes to business lending at affordable rates, the Government has already launched myriad financial initiatives, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/aug/01/funding-for-lending-scheme-scepticism\" title=\"\">Funding for Lending</a>. For smaller firms, these have been hard to penetrate, which is why the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) recommends a \"one-stop shop\" to make the whole process easier.</p> <p>I'm not convinced we need a state business bank on the high street, but the Government can add to what banks do. There is a critical need for an aggregation platform which bundles loans and allows medium-sized firms to raise money in the bond market.</p> <p>A successful industrial strategy needs to build on what the UK is good at, with a renewed emphasis on specific sectors like automotive, aerospace and creative industries.</p> <p>Despite our size, the UK is a world leader in many sectors and if we are to secure significant growth in the decades to come, the government must give them the science, the skills and the infrastructure to stay ahead of international rivals.</p> <p>Politicians of all persuasions need a laser-like focus on the importance of a stable and nurturing policy environment. A coalition of the willing around new world-beating technologies could achieve a step change in our industrial future.</p> <p>\u2022 John Cridland is the director general of the CBI</p>",

  "<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want to find some books with a convincing and positive secondary school setting for my son who is just changing schools this year. Are any books that make secondary school look fun!</p> </blockquote> <p>I don't think I can give you a lot of good news on this! Sadly, although primary schools such as Gene Kemp's Cricklepit Combined School, which features in her award-winning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780571230945/the-turbulent-term-of-tyke-tiler\">The Turbulent Term of Tyke Tiler</a> and subsequent titles, are often shown as good places run by sympathetic teachers, secondary school are rarely portrayed with the same warmth. Except, of course, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2012/apr/16/jk-rowling-pottermore-harry-potter\">Hogwarts</a>. </p> <p>But even there, if you reconstruct the darkside in terms of contemporary tough children from \"bad\" homes, it shows that even for schoolboy wizards there is more to life there than feasting and flying, while bullying \u2013 which most children changing schools fear above all \u2013 is even more dangerous given the curses that the gifted and talented of Hogwarts can pull off. </p> <p>From the classics, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780199537303/tom-browns-schooldays\">Tom Brown's Schooldays</a> through Phil Redmond's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/phil-redmond\">Grange Hill, </a>better-known through TV, life in secondary school in both the US and the UK is largely described as a fight for survival. Of course, there are alternative views especially set in the up-beat boarding school series of the 1930s and onwards but they were always a kind of fantasy and the school is really only a make-believe environment in which the children can develop their friendships, rivalries and the rest without parents around. </p> <p>Robert Cormier knocked any ideas of schools being places of safety on the head in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/robert-cormier\">The Chocolate War</a>, an outstanding book of the 1970s in which a group of boys, backed by a corrupt teacher, run a protection racket through which they crush the good, new boy hero. </p> <p>Cormier believed that children should be told the truth but many objected to the portrayal and his books were banned by several US libraries on the grounds that their message would damage the young. It was very much of its time in being no holds barred about the difficulties of adolescence and the level of destruction to which teenagers might go. </p> <p>Cormier was just one among several writing in the same vein and despite the objections to The Chocolate War it was a fashion that prevailed. The school story didn't bounce back partly because in the UK education was radically altered by the setting up of comprehensive schools. Authors who hadn't attend schools like that didn't have enough knowledge to write about them while polarised views about private and state education became an issue and any reference to school immediately raised questions of elitism and class. </p> <p>Thirty years on, although there are lots of books with powerful and arresting school settings, everyday good experiences of children at their local schools are depressingly missing from fiction right now. Despite many children enjoying school, schools are all too often dismissed by their narrator as \"just the local comp\" and the character often yearns to be at a better school. </p> <p>Stereotypes about chaotic lessons abound as does the \"uncool\" image nailed to children who want to work. American high schools are faring better \u2013 especially for older teens who don't mind a bit of paranormal alongside their education. Werewolves and vampires often hang out in surprisingly regular schools. But then, as with the magical problems of Hogwarts, the risk of unexpected still remains!</p> <p>Bad news stories are more marketable than good news one and maybe it will always been fashionable to paint school in a bad light but, despite my very great respect for The Chocolate War, it would be nice to see the fashion change.</p> <p><strong>If you know of any other good news stories about schools, let us know at <a href=\"mailto:childrens.books@theguardian.com\">childrens.books@theguardian.com</a></strong></p> <h2>Your suggestions</h2> <p><strong>Rachel</strong><br>Many of Anne Fine's books deal with school - in one way or another. Flour Babies is an example of this. And K M Peyton's Pennington's Seventeenth Summer describes the full range of school.</p>",
  "<h2>THE RETURN OF NORMALITY, IF NOT THE PREMIER LEAGUE QUITE YET</h2> <p>There were amazing scenes on the streets of London yesterday, as the nation paid its respects to everyone involved in the Olympic and Paralympic Games. It was a spectacular carnival celebrating a month during which Great Britain excelled at disciplines such as the Heptathlon, the Road Race C4-5, the 5,000 Metres, the Discus F51/52/53, the Lightweight Double Sculls, the Passive Aggressive Jingoistic Smug Reacharound, the Watching Sport Every Four Years And Spotting Something Achingly Obvious Then Telling People Who Watch Sport All The Time The Achingly Obvious Thing They've Just Spotted In A Confident Manner Bordering On Outright Braying Which Clearly Suggests They Consider People Who Watch Sport All The Time To Have Severe Cognitive Difficulties, and the Dressage.</p> <p>But that's all over now, and Britain can go back to concentrating on the pastimes we're normally interested in. Stuff like tennis, internet trolling and football. Andy Murray winning the US Open last night covers the first two bases, while this evening there are some World Cup qualifiers to further ease us back to normality. The big match, need we tell you, is Scotland versus Macedonia. Now, you can tell the mood Craig Levein is in by the length of his beard, which he squeezes in and out like Play-Doh hair. A full, wild fungus means he's up for a rammy. Severe stubble suggests he's up for a rammy. Somewhere in between and guess what?</p> <p>That's right, and apparently it's \"nonsense\" that Scotland's qualification is in the balance after the draw against Serbia last weekend, a match which saw Levein once again controversially name an XI without a striker by selecting Kenny Miller. \"Come the end of the tournament, the point against Serbia might be the one that makes all the difference,\" he growled, without going on to mention the two dropped that might make an even bigger difference, two points that were on offer to anyone brave enough to give Jordan Rhodes more than 0.00035876 seconds of game time.</p> <p>Serbia are meanwhile back home in Novi Sad, where they face Wales, whose biggest worry is ostensibly the fitness of Joe Allen, but actually should be Chris Coleman's slightly less than proactive managerial masterplan. \"We're going to score and we're going to win, sooner or later that's going to happen,\" he yawned, swinging his feet up on the desk. \"People say you're only as good as your worst game. Nonsense, that doesn't make sense. You're as good as your best game, because that's the level you've shown. Somehow.\" Glad that's sorted out, then.</p> <p>Norn Iron 1-0 fans are likely to be in much less of a panic than their Welsh brethren, as their lads are only playing tiny Luxembourg, who are... hold on, they're 23 places higher than the Iron in the Fifa rankings! When did that happen? Oh. Oh dear. Moving swiftly on, then, and finally there's England, who will face Ukraine with the cast that starred in Moldova minus virus victim Theo Walcott, and who we mention only briefly in a pathetically transparent ploy to annoy grown adults who should know better but nevertheless get jolly het up about such things.</p> <p>And finally, in this weekend's Global Champions Tour showjumping, Nick Skelton and Michael Whitaker are hoping to make up ground on Australian rider Edwina Tops-Alexander who has been leading the event since April, when she ... hey, where have all the Watching Sport Every Four Years People gone?</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\" title=\"\"><em>Follow England 2-0 Ukraine with Scott Murray's minute-by-minute report and all the other matches we can't be bothered incorrectly predicting the scores of for precious little comic effect with John Ashdown's clockwatch from 7pm</em></a></p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"There's a bit of a media spotlight on me so if we go down, I'm going to take a lot of s**t.

  "<p>When Sir Peter Bazalgette, the man who brought Big Brother to the UK, was appointed chairman of Arts Council England, the level of opprobrium from some quarters was entirely predictable. \"It is very worrying that someone who has dumbed down, trivialised and sexualised mass TV viewing with Big Brother has been put in charge of British culture,\" Labour MP Denis MacShane told Bazalgette's most relentless critic, the Daily Mail.</p> <p>It was the Mail's Quentin Letts, Bazalgette's tormentor-in-chief, who named him one of the \"10 worst Britons\", and dubbed him a \"brutal populist\" and \"buttery schmoozer\" who \"throws champagne parties at his \u00a310m house\" in Notting Hill. Bazalgette \u2013 or \"Baz\" as he is known to friends and colleagues \u2013 does indeed throw a memorable summer party in the gardens of his west London home. \"It is probably the best group of media people you will get to meet, very eclectic but powerful,\" says venture capitalist Luke Johnson, chairman of Channel 4 when Bazalgette, 59, was one of its non-executive directors.</p> <p>Where else could you meet Mark Thompson, outgoing director general of the BBC, and celebrity chef Ainsley Harriott, star of one of Bazalgette's earlier TV hits, over the canapes?</p> <p>\"He's a sort of renaissance man because not only has he been a great programme-maker and entrepreneur,\" adds Johnson. \"He's written books, and he writes a food column for the FT. He's a fabulous networker, he's great company and \u2013 let's face it \u2013 he's ambitious.\"</p> <p>In a 30-year television career, Bazalgette's list of credits extend beyond Big Brother. He was also responsible for the rise of programmes such as Ready Steady Cook, Changing Rooms and Ground Force which became global hits in the 1990s and would help make Bazalgette his fortune. The chattering classes looked down on those too. \"He believed if something was popular then it was probably good,\" says Tim Hincks, president of Endemol Group, producer of Big Brother, who worked with Bazalgette for many years. \"He enjoys controversy, he certainly likes a debate.\"</p> <p>Knighted for services to television earlier this year, he will succeed Dame Liz Forgan \u2013 who also chairs the Scott Trust, owner of the Guardian \u2013 as chair of Arts Council England in February next year. He takes over at a critical time. The patron of 690 arts bodies across England and with \u00a31.4bn to disburse, along with \u00a3850m from the National Lottery, has already suffered a near 30% cut in grants and faces the prospect of further cuts in 2015. The council is also in the process of slashing the amount of money it spends on its own administration from 11% of its total budget to 3.5%. \"It's a very nervous time internally,\" says one insider.</p> <p>Bazalgette is familiar with the challenges of funding the arts. He is a long-time board member and deputy chairman of the English National Opera, and was appointed its chairman in June. He has also served as a non-executive director at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), giving him a glimpse, when it comes to the next round of funding negotiations, over both sides of the fence.</p> <p>\"It is going to be another really tough spending round, and he needs to find the right arguments to convince the government that quite a small amount of spending on arts and culture brings phenomenally great rewards,\" says Tony Hall, chief executive of the Royal Opera House. \"We have to demonstrate that we are doing absolutely everything we can to bring money into the arts, but we still need support, especially outside of London. Having someone of Peter's background making those arguments will be really powerful.\"</p> <p>The great-great grandson of Sir Joseph Bazalgette, who built London's Victorian sewer system, Bazalgette was born in London in 1953 and went to Dulwich College in south-east London, where his contemporaries included Financial Times editor Lionel Barber, and then to Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he become president of Cambridge Union. His university friend John Makinson, chairman of Penguin and the National Theatre, remembers him as a \"superstar of the union. His trademark qualities are that he manages to be both irreverent and self-deprecating on the one hand, and yet serious and thoughtful on the other, all features that were well in evidence in his Cambridge days\".</p> <p>He is variously described as \"fantastic fun and thoroughly approachable, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye\", but with an occasional tendency to nod off in meetings. Linked to various of the big broadcasting jobs over the last decade, he came closest in 2002 when he was in the running to be chief executive of Channel 4, only to pull out at the last minute. Channel 4's Johnson discussed the same role with him two years later.</p> <p>\"I think he took the view that it was too much grief,\" remembers Johnson. \"He had the entrepreneurial bug and was more interested in pursuing a range of different things.\"</p> <p>Johnson also has a warning: \"He may find chairing the Arts Council constraining. I am sure he is up to the task but he won't necessarily find it what he has been used to in recent times.\"</p> <p>Sir Nicholas Kenyon, managing director of the Barbican Centre and, like Bazalgette, a member of the ENO board, describes him as \"absolutely the right man for what is a very difficult job\".</p> <p>\"The fact that Baz has been on the board of the DCMS will ensure there is continuity of thinking. The challenge will be how far he is prepared to criticise and distance himself from it; he does not want to be seen as an agent of the DCMS as chairman of the Arts Council.\"</p> <p>Kenyon is quick to praise the marketing and digital nous that Bazalgette brought to ENO, and the new Arts Council chief is understood to be particularly keen on highlighting the commercial and cultural payback from state sponsorship of the arts. Both Stephen Daldry, head of the Olympics ceremonies, and Danny Boyle, who directed the acclaimed opening spectacular to the London Games, had their breaks in state-subsidised theatre (Daldry at the Sheffield Crucible, Boyle at the Royal Court Theatre).</p> <p>Former ENO board member Janis Susskind, who stepped down in July, describes him as \"thoughtful and energetic\". She says: \"It is better that he has seen from the inside what the challenges are in a major arts organisation rather than being some abstract theorist coming in from the outside.\"</p> <p>Emerging from university with a third in law \u2013 possibly as a result of spending too much time writing the student newspaper gossip column \u2013 Bazalgette has joked that he had no option but to pursue a career in the media. He joined the BBC as a news trainee and was spotted by Esther Rantzen, who hired him to work as a researcher on That's Life. Bazalgette later said that he learned all he knew \"at Esther's knee&#xa0;\u2026 it's all about informing and entertaining\". He went on to produce BBC2's Food and Drink and set up his own company, Bazal, in 1987, which was sold to Dutch company Endemol three years later. He rose to become its creative director in 1998, stepping down from the company nearly a decade later.</p> <p>Although he did not create Big Brother, he was closely involved in its UK incarnation which debuted on Channel 4 in 2000. It has been sullied by a string of controversies, including racism rows and an episode of on-screen violence which prompted viewers to call the police, but the first series was genuinely groundbreaking, not least for its use of streamed video on the internet. Axed by Channel 4, it has since been picked up by Channel 5.</p> <p>Estimates of a seven-figure salary at Endemol are said to be over-inflated, but he did enjoy a bonus payout worth several million pounds during his time with the company, and enjoyed a further windfall when it was sold to Telef\u00f3nica in 2000. He is certainly not doing his new job, which pays \u00a340,000 for a two-day week, for the money.</p> <p>Married with two children, he has earned enough to have two holiday homes, one in Tuscany and one on the south Devon coast, and his official Debrett's biography lists \"gluttony\" among his recreations. He is also a cricket fanatic \u2013 a colleague once said that he only hired him because he needed a wicketkeeper for his team.</p> <p>Bazalgette consistently refuses to be drawn on his politics. The most anyone has got out of him was that he has voted for different parties. He was briefly involved with a Conservative party commission on reviving popular interest in the democratic process, but stepped down when it became too high-profile.\"He is interested in the political process and how government works, rather than having political ambitions in any obvious way,\" says Makinson. \"He has very strong views on the BBC and Channel 4, and is interested in those organisations which sit on the boundary of private and public sector. He is very comfortable patrolling those boundaries. That's where [the Arts Council role] sits and I think he will be very good at it.\" Bazalgette was also on the advisory board of The Space, a digital joint venture between the BBC and the Arts Council that played host to new arts projects as well as archive material such as John Peel's record collection.</p> <p>It had echoes of an idea Bazalgette floated four years ago for a new platform to showcase content from arts institutions, museums and galleries, if not the way it is funded \u2013 which, he suggested, could include the sale of Radios 1 and 2.</p> <p>Roly Keating, the BBC's former director of archive content, and now chief executive of the British Library, who was closely involved in setting up The Space, says: \"I was a huge fan of Liz Forgan. But if Liz is to leave, then in Baz they have found someone very different but of equal calibre and charisma.</p> <p>\"What Baz has is a zest for life and people and restless curiosity that made him a very good TV producer. Behind that sometimes sardonic facade is a very sharp brain at work.\"</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> 22 May 1953</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 59</p> <p><strong>Career:</strong> A TV producer and entrepreneur credited with helping to invent reality TV, Bazalgette created television shows including Ready Steady Cook, Changing Rooms and became creative director of Endemol, the company behind Big Brother and Deal or No Deal</p> <p><strong>High point:</strong> Launching Big Brother in the UK in 2000, after which he was routinely held responsible for everything that was good or bad about TV entertainment. The first series, a genuinely ground-breaking experiment, changed the face of television</p> <p><strong>Low point:</strong> See above. If the first series of Big Brother broke the mould, later series would be beset by scandal with a succession of race rows, on-screen fights, accusations of exploitation and no end of sexual shennanigans</p> <p><strong>What he says:</strong> \"It is much more difficult making popular TV. It is very absorbing and challenging. I genuinely hope I am a no-brow person.\"</p> <p><strong>What they say:</strong> \"[He has] done more to debase television over the past decade than anyone else.\" (Victor Lewis-Smith, 2003)</p> <p>ends</p>",
  "<p>The Social Value Act, which is expected to be adopted in early 2013, will ask councils to consider how services they deliver or commission will improve the wellbeing of their residents and the impact they have on the economic and social environment.</p> <p>The act will force councils to think more broadly about commissioning and how to measure and understand what happens as a result of a service, rather than simply what it sets out to achieve. Councils may have to consider the amount of apprentices each contract will provide, for example, as well as how residents will respond.</p> <p>Although debate continues about how to quantify social value, those <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/aug/06/social-impact-bonds-councils-financial-freedom\" title=\"\">authorities who are looking to use social impact bonds</a> are beginning to do just that, and the more the idea catches on, the more consistent measuring is likely to become.</p> <p>Making ethical decisions about the way services are run will mean more engagement and accountability for local people, so how will authorities manage this?

That's comedy. Speak ill of the dead? That's a problem, as the Comedy Central TV channel found out this week. <a href=\"http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2012/09/06/16095/comedy_central_in_michael_clarke_duncan_gaffe\" title=\"Comedy Central in Michael Clarke Duncan gaffe\">As Chortle reports</a>, two days after the death of Green Mile star Michael Clarke Duncan, an announcer introduced an episode of the sitcom Two and a Half Men (in which Duncan starred) by saying that his career never \"took off\". Cue Twitter outrage, as viewers rallied to defend the late star's reputation and deplore the station's insensitivity. \"The announcer's comments about Michael Clarke Duncan after the two &amp; a half men episode were disgusting &amp; disrespectful,\" etc etc.</p> <p>Comedy Central sought to douse the flames by revealing that the announcement had been recorded before the actor's death. \"Sorry about that,\" the channel tweeted, \"it was an oversight on our part. We'll have it sorted pronto.\" Marketing director Bill Griffin later commented: 'We are very sorry for the insensitive comment \u2026 [It] was pre-recorded in advance of Mr Duncan's untimely death but should not have been said at all. We have taken immediate action to prevent this from happening in the future.\" What that action might be was not specified.</p> <h2>Over to you \u2013 my pick of the week's reader comments</h2> <p>On Monday I wrote about an experience I had on the Edinburgh fringe, sitting watching bad standup <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/10/comedy-gigs-stag-hen-dos\" title=\"Stag and hen dos are a comedian's worst nightmare\">among a hen-night audience</a>. To <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/10/comedy-gigs-stag-hen-dos?commentpage=1#comment-18179864\" title=\"\">MattGreenComedy</a> , this sounded as if comics were \"damned if they do, damned if they don't\":</p> <blockquote> To get [stag and hen dos] laughing is hard work \u2013 and usually requires \"pandering\". It's a difficult and admirable skill, but would get you hammered by many critics. On the other hand, if you stick to your guns, have a clear artistic vision, try to do something a little bit different, or that requires a bit more attention, then sometimes you will come up against an audience that is not in the mood for that and there will be a clash. And then the critic might attack you for not playing to the audience. You can begin to feel that you can't win. <br> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/10/comedy-gigs-stag-hen-dos?commentpage=1#comment-18180805\" title=\"\">BigbadD</a> saw it differently:</p> <blockquote> If you fail to make people laugh and piss them off so much they leave, you've failed on that occasion. Whether you're excorcising [sic] your inner demons, firing quips off quickly, scandalising your audience with near the knuckle rape jokes or simply ambling along amusingly, you being there on the stage means you are there to entertain. </blockquote> <p>Ad libbing may be incredibly difficult, but the best are able to do it and gauge an audience early on, manipulating their own act appropriately.</p> <p>Steven Fielding's blog on The Thick of It (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/thick-of-it-safe-comedy\" title=\"Why The Thick of It is safe comedy\">see above</a>), which argued that Armando Iannucci's sitcom merely \"reinforces the popular view that our political class is appalling and suggests that we can do nothing about it but laugh at them. How reassuring that is,\" raised hackles below the line, with<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18164332\" title=\"\"> AllyF</a> speaking for many when he wrote</p> <blockquote> I don't want to be reassured, thank you very much. I want my contempt and anger to be stoked and justified, and I want to take some semblance of comfort in laughter, and I make absolutely no apologies for that. </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/thick-of-it-safe-comedy?commentpage=1#comment-18164608\" title=\"\">TerribleLyricist</a> was one of several commenters who had some sympathy with Fielding's position:</p> <blockquote> This does play to the neoliberals' favour. The right are always banging on about how government is bad, the market is the answer, and how small government, or even no government in some areas, is what we want. When the population is (understandably) jaded and cynical, and abandons politics, this only helps the right </blockquote> <p>A view endorsed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/thick-of-it-safe-comedy?commentpage=1#comment-18164550\" title=\"\">retrorik</a>:</p> <blockquote> In some weird way, as [with] Spitting Image in the 80s, these satires merely give credibility to this political system. Funny at times, yes; but appealing to the already cynical will not serve any purpose save for 'entertainment'. Armando Iannucci, (just like other 'Ben Elton's' of comedy) is already an establishment figure. </blockquote> <p>So what we need is a political comedy written by an anti-Establishment figure. If only Frank Sidebottom were still available, I feel sure he'd be the man for the job.</p>",

Listen here<br></a><br>Liverpudlian quartet Wave Machines released their debut album Wave If You're Really There in 2009 to favourable reviews and then did what most bands do: go on tour, play some festivals and carry on making music. Shortly after the album came out, however, one of its songs, Keep the Lights On, was picked by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR6rjWomtjo\">Volkswagen</a> for their latest global advertising campaign and up-and-coming singer Joyce then transformed it into a juddering R&amp;B belter (the <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/joycejoycejoyce/sets/joyce-keep-the-lights-on/\">Clams Casino remix</a> is also very good). All this means there's slightly more pressure on the band's as yet untitled follow-up, which is being trailed by new single Ill Fit, premiered here. Produced by Lexxx (Gwilym Gold, Wild Beasts), the glitchy, Prince-esque Ill Fit was, according to the band's frontman Tim Bruzon, influenced by \"the fuzzy moment right before you make a decision to do something right or wrong, justifiable or unjustifiable,\" and it does indeed seem infused with a strange kind of tension, sexual or otherwise.<br><br>\u2022 Ill Fit is released on 22 October via Neapolitan/Pias.</p>",
  "<p>The extraordinary saga of a huge regeneration scheme - the <a href=\"http://www.myearlscourt.com/\">Earls Court project</a> - backed by two prestige Conservative councils which would see the Earls Court exhibition centre and 760 nearby homes demolished to make way for a high-rise, high-cost \"new urban quarter\" on 77 acres of prime inner west London real estate continues to astonish and amaze.</p> <p>Earlier this month the cabinet of Hammersmith and Fulham council, which David Cameron has described as his favourite and communities secretary Eric Pickles as \"the apple of my eye,\" voted to sell the land on which two neighbouring housing estates \u2013 the West Kensington and the Gibbs Green \u2013 stand to a subsidiary of property developer Capco for \u00a3105m, condemning the flats and houses there to demolition. <br> This is despite the council's own <a href=\"http://democracy.lbhf.gov.uk/documents/s18032/Appendix%205%20-%20Initial%20statistical%20analysis%20of%20feedback%20from%20consultation.pdf\">assessment of the outcome of its consultation of the estates' residents (pdf)</a> showing that respondents <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/22/london-council-tenants-earls-court\">opposed to losing their flats and houses</a> outnumber those favouring it, perhaps persuaded by the council's pledge to provide replacement homes nearby, by a margin of more than three to one. </p> <p>On Wednesday Hammersmith and Fulham's planning committee looks certain to approve the latest versions of the two main planning applications for the scheme, but will do so in the knowledge that a dossier documenting alleged possible misconduct in public office, a criminal offence, and a possible breach of the Housing Act 1996 has been handed to the police. </p> <p>The dossier claims that some residents have been promised priority allocation to new homes to be built in the development area in return for their support for the Earls Court scheme, and quotes from what it says are of accounts by around 20 residents of such offers being made. However, in internal correspondence senior council officers have strongly denied that any so-called \"VIP list\" of residents has been compiled \u2013 the council's press office has reiterated this - or that any improper behaviour has occurred.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"http://www.aeo.org.uk/\">Association of Event Organisers</a> is arguing passionately that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/aug/01/boris-johnson-olympic-ealrs-court-demolition\">the loss of the famous exhibition centre</a>, which hosted the volleyball competition during the Olympics, would damage both the local economy and London's as a whole. This seems to have cut little ice as yet with either Hammersmith and Fulham or its Tory neighbour Royal Kensington and Chelsea, in which the eastern side of the development area lies and which includes the older of the two Earls Court centre buildings. </p> <p>Strong objections to the project have also been expressed by a panel of urban design experts invited by the two boroughs to comment on the scheme, whose masterplan was drawn up by Sir Terry Farrell. The panel's final report (available via <a href=\"http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/planningandconservation/planningapplications/earlscourtapplication.aspx\">here</a>) says that it \"remains to be convinced that the Applicants proposals are an acceptable scale and desirable form of development for this strategically important London site.\" It urges the various planning authorities involved to \"resist pressure to approve the current applications in their present form.\" </p> <p>This seems highly unlikely to occur. The Earls Court project has been pursued with passion by Hammersmith and Fulham in the teeth of all and any opposition. While it admits that \"a majority\" of West Kensington and Gibbs Green estate residents who took part in the council's consultation are opposed to its plans, it seems reluctant to recognise the size of that majority, preferring to say that \"a large number\" did not take part. </p> <p>However, an unusually large number for this type of exercise did: 805 responses from 515 of the 760 households. The two estates' anti-demolition campaign claims that council officers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/jun/19/greenhalgh-hammersm-fulham-earls-court-consultation\">omitted or miscategorised</a> a significant number of responses, and that the true ratio of objectors to supporters was actually in the region of four to one.</p> <p>The council seems keener on the responses from residents in the surrounding area, which it says showed support for the scheme by a ratio of more than four to one. However, the response rate in this case was a tiny 2% - just 448 replies to the 29,240 consultation packs distributed. </p> <p>This is an odd position for a council whose slogan is \"putting residents first\" to end up in. It pledges that, \"all homes on the estates would be replaced within the [full] redevelopment area,\" and be offered to the existing residents (I'll be examining the detail of this offer another time). It also claims that the land sale agreement will \"pave the way,\" for the Earls Court project as a whole to eventually provide \"more than \u00a31 billion worth of community benefits in the local area,\" creating 9,500 permanent new jobs and a total of 8,000 new homes. </p> <p>Council leader Nick Botterill asserts that the residents of the estates would be \"the major beneficiaries of this investment,\" though we might wonder if they would gain more than Capco, which puts the potential value of the Earls Court project at \u00a38 billion. Residents first or property developers first?</p> <p>The entire saga brings the dilemmas and paradoxes of localism into fascinating focus. The council's case that the Earls Court locality's interest would be served by going ahead with the entire scheme inherently entails going against the wishes of a large number of local people, many of them elderly, and their interest as they define it in not having their present homes knocked down.</p> <p>It isn't only Tory Hammersmith and Fulham where this type of argument is going on. Something similar on a smaller scale is rumbling on at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jun/13/london-2012-legacy-battle-newham\">the edge of the Olympic Park</a> in Labour Newham. But there is a particular trust problem with Hammersmith and Fulham. </p> <p>Most of the 760 homes on the two estates are rented at social rent levels from the council or housing associations and it hasn't gone unnoticed that Botterill's predecessor Stephen Greenhalgh, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/07/stephen-greenhalgh-interview\">told the Guardian in February</a> that the Earls Court scheme represents \"the best deal in the history of redevelopment in London,\" co-authored a <a href=\"http://www.localis.org.uk/article/82/Principles-for-Social-Housing-Reform.htm\">pamphlet for the local government think tank Localis</a>, which advocated selling off all such housing (except for a tiny number of very dependent people) in order to release the value of the land they stood on and end what was characterised as a socially harmful cycle of dependency. </p> <p>This expression of a fundamental philosophical \u2013 indeed, moral - dislike for social housing is held by critics of Greenhalgh and his regime to be the true motivating factor behind his inclusion of the estates in the Earls Court project, along with a covert desire to make the political complexion of the area bluer by bringing more wealthy people into it \u2013 a charge that Greenhalgh and the council have always strongly denied.</p> <p>After Botterill and his cabinet approved the land sale to Capco, the anti-demolition campaigners vowed that <a href=\"http://westkengibbsgreen.wordpress.com/2012/09/04/we-shall-never-surrender/\">it will never surrender</a>. It is already <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/jun/21/nick-botterill-earls-court-project-legal-challenge\">taking legal action</a> through the High Court, claiming that the council has failed to follow proper procedures, and argues that the conduct of David Cameron's favourite council <a href=\"http://westkengibbsgreen.wordpress.com/2012/08/23/prime-minister-faces-final-big-society-test-will-he-let-his-favourite-council-bulldoze-our-community/\">flies directly in the face of his Big Society idea</a>, which envisages local people taking responsibility for their own lives \u2013 the campaigners want to own and run the estates themselves.</p> <p>There is one other prominent Conservative politician who could stop the Earls Court project in its tracks \u2013 Boris Johnson. As London's mayor he has powers to block, demand amendments to or even determine for himself large developments in the capital. He has already exercised this power in relation to the Earls Court project. Last December, Greater London Authority planning officers rejected Capco's initial applications for the main part of the scheme after Hammersmith and Fulham had approved them because they were deemed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/davehillblog/2011/dec/09/regeneration-housing\">at odds with 44 policies</a> in the mayor's London Plan \u2013 the capital's master planning document - including under-provision of affordable housing. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://democracy.lbhf.gov.uk/documents/s22021/PAC%20report%2004_9_12%20FINAL2.pdf\">officer report (pdf)</a> provided the council's planning committee in advance of Wednesday's meeting argues in some detail that the revised applications conform to the London Plan's requirements. Time will tell if the GLA's officers agree, but it would be quite a surprise if Johnson doesn't give the project a green light in the end. He has recently appointed Greenhalgh, its prime evangelist, head of his new office for policing and crime. When Johnson was questioned about the scheme by the London Assembly in 2010 he described Greenhalgh as \"the great man.\" And as his <a href=\"http://snipelondon.com/scoop/boris-gives-95000-job-to-former-evening-standard-editor\">recent appointment</a> of former Boris-loving Evening Standard editor Veronica Wadley as an advisor underlines, Mayor Jolly Goodfun knows how to look after his chums.</p>",
  "<p>The idea of a patron saint of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/04/sock-puppetry-publish-be-damned?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">sock-puppetry</a> is more than a little incoherent (perhaps <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardino_of_Siena\" title=\"\">St Bernardino of Siena</a> pretending to be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_de_Sales\" title=\"\">St Francis de Sales</a>?), but if the practice did want at least an honoured ancestor, then I'd propose some form of monument to Esdras Barnivelt. Esdras Barnivelt was writing in the period when reviewing, publicity and the widespread discussion of literature in broadsheets, newspapers and magazines was just emerging. <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">He wrote a pamphlet called A Key To The Lock</a>, subtitled \"a Treatise proving, beyond all Contradiction, the dangerous Tendency of a late Poem entitled The Rape of the Lock to Government and Religion\", claiming that Pope's witty mock-heroic was actually a coded allegory about the Barrier Treaty. The joke is, of course, that Esdras Barnivelt was actually <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/alexander-pope\" title=\"\">Alexander Pope</a> himself.</p> <p>Pope was both fascinated and appalled by the climate of literary flyting; Joseph Guerinot's magisterial bibliography, <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Pamphlet_Attacks_on_Alexander_Pope_1711.html?id=RlcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">Pamphlet Attacks on Alexander Pope, 1711-1744</a>, runs to 360 pages, and includes work such as Tom O'Bedlam's Dunciad: Or Pope, Alexander, the Pig, Pope Alexander's Supremacy and Infallibility Examin'd and A Pop Upon Pope. This 18th century version of trolling often depicted Pope as a hunchbacked monkey wearing a papal tiara, his name reduced to A.P.E. Pope thrived on the contentions almost as a defence against their often vicious depictions of his disabilities. Rather than sit serenely above the fray, Pope revelled in it, critiquing his own works and attacking his enemies with even more poetic bile.</p> <p>He wasn't the only author, pre-Amazon, to indulge in such practices. The Quarterly Review for January 1817 carried <a href=\"http://digital.nls.uk/jma/gallery/title.cfm?id=13\" title=\"\">a long (anonymous) review</a> of the recently published (and anonymous) Tales of My Landlord. The book is now better known as The Black Dwarf and The Tale of Old Mortality by Sir Walter Scott; the review in the Quarterly was by Scott as well. Scott's chief objective in reviewing his own work, apart from keeping up the mystification around who the \"Author of Waverley\" actually was, was to counter a review in the Christian Instructor by the Rev Thomas M'Crie. M'Crie, a biographer of John Knox and Andrew Melville, took exception to Scott's depiction of the Covenanters, and his sympathetic portrayal of Claverhouse. Scott used the Quarterly to present historical evidence for his stance; but he also wrote perceptively about his own books \u2013 and not particularly positively. \"Probability and perspicuity of narrative are sacrificed with the utmost indifference to the desire of producing effect\", he writes, adding \"the author errs chiefly from carelessness\" and suffers from \"flimsiness and incoherent texture\". Warming to his theme he continues \"in addition to the loose and incoherent style of the narration another leading fault in these novels is the total want of interest which the reader attaches to the character of the hero\". They are all a \"very amiable and very insipid sort of young men\". One wonders how many people got the joke, especially when Scott writes: \"Few can wish his success more sincerely than we do, and yet without more attention on his part, we have great doubts of its continuance.\"</p> <p>For a while in the 1980s, few books were published without an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/anthony-burgess\" title=\"\">Anthony Burgess</a> review quote on the paperback. In an interview with Charles Bunting in 1973, Burgess said of the reviews of his own books: \"It often happens that they're reviewed by Catholic priests, or Jesuit scholars, or something, which is not quite what I want, or they're reviewed by agnostics or atheists which, again, is not quite what I want. I suppose the idea is they want you to review one's own books, and I did this on one occasion. I got fired from the newspaper for it, but I did try it.\" The paper in question was the Yorkshire Post for which he reviewed, among others, Updike, Nabokov, Brooke-Rose and Lessing. But his infraction was to review, on 16 May 1963, Inside Mr Enderby, the first of his brilliant quartet about a failed poet, which he published under the pseudonym Joseph Kell. Burgess claimed he thought it was practical joke on the part of the literary editor. \"This is\", he wrote \"in many ways, a dirty book\u2026 it may well make some people sick, and those of my readers with tender stomachs are advised to let it alone. It turns sex, religion, the State into a series of laughing stocks. The book itself is a laughing stock.\" The review of Inside Mr Enderby was part of a round-up of eight titles: Burgess was far more enthusiastic about Malamud's The Natural and BS Johnson's Travelling People (which he compared to Ulysses) than his own book. That said, his self-review is not wholly selfless: in 1963 the cachet of being a \"dirty book\" like Lolita or Lady Chatterley's Lover was pretty high.</p> <p>What is strikingly different about Pope, Scott and Burgess and the business of self-reviewing compared to the antics of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/03/rj-ellory-secret-amazon-reviews?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">RJ Ellory</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jul/16/orlando-figes-fake-amazon-reviews?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Orlando Figes</a> is the charming self-deprecation, the wry knowingness of the older authors. What really irks about the modern sock-puppeteers is how graceless and gauche their self-praise is.</p>",

  "<h2><strong>1 Working with Ivan Lendl</strong></h2> <p>It is too simplistic to suggest that the arrival of Ivan Lendl at the turn of the year changed Andy Murray from a serial runner-up into <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/11/andy-murray-us-open-novak-djokovic\" title=\"\">a grand slam champion</a> but the player has acknowledged what Lendl has brought to the table. Having lost his first four grand slam finals before winning eight, Lendl knows what Murray has been feeling in the buildup to big moments and has helped him to relax and believe in his game. Having someone such as him back you and your ability to win the sport's biggest titles has added to Murray's inner belief and he has helped the Scot to commit to go for his shots and never have any regrets. In the big moments against Novak Djokovic, especially after the fourth set, Murray stepped closer to the baseline again and was aggressive while always being in control. That was pure Lendl.</p> <h2><strong>2 Winning Olympic gold</strong></h2> <p>There is nothing like winning a big one to give you the taste for more. Lendl told Murray the pressure was off in New York because he had already won a \"major\", <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/blog/2012/jul/08/andy-murray-roger-federer-wimbledon\" title=\"\">driven on by the near miss at Wimbledon</a> a few weeks beforehand and by a patriotic and at times raucous crowd. Victories over Djokovic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/03/andy-murray-olympic-gold-medal-chance\" title=\"\">in the Olympic semi-final</a> and then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/05/andy-murray-olympic-gold-great-britain\" title=\"\">revenge over Federer</a> in the final for that Wimbledon loss were stunning performances and convinced Murray that he really did belong in the same breath as those two and Rafael Nadal. Perhaps more importantly, it may even have shown the top three that Murray would no longer be crushed by doubt and was now a true champion. As Lendl said, if that was worth one or two points in a match, perhaps a point in that dramatic first-set tie-break on Monday, then it was all worth it.</p> <h2><strong>3 Pushing Djokovic so close in Australia</strong></h2> <p>In the immediate aftermath of Monday's win, Lendl mentioned how crucial Murray's performance <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jan/27/novak-djokovic-andy-murray-australian-open\" title=\"\">in the semi-final of the Australian Open</a> in January had been to his progress. The way the Scot matched Djokovic for almost five hours, physically and mentally, gave him huge belief that the next time they went toe to toe over five sets in the heat of the battle, he would be able to live with the Serb. When the pair met in the final of the Australian Open in 2011, Murray froze; this time, he knew that despite a long hard summer he had enough in the tank to stay with Djokovic, even when the inevitable fightback began. Having first played each other in an under-12 event in France there are no secrets between the two friends, but after Melbourne Murray knew that, despite the disappointment, he was right there. Djokovic would have known it too.</p> <h2><strong>4 That bit of luck</strong></h2> <p>Unlike Federer, Nadal and Djokovic himself, all of whom played \"lesser\" players in their first grand slam final, Murray's four previous attempts had been thwarted by proven champions (Federer three times and Djokovic once). This time, with no Nadal to worry about and placed in Federer's half, he benefited from not having the mental stress of trying to beat the Swiss after he lost to Tomas Berdych in the quarters. Berdych could not handle the wind against Murray in the semis and then the extra day of rest he had had countered the fact that he had spent five hours more on court than Djokovic going into the final. It is hard to say whether that helped in the deciding set of the final on Monday because Djokovic is a phenomenal athlete. But it can't have hurt. Murray deserved that bit of luck and he took advantage.</p> <h2><strong>5 The New York crowd and those Wimbledon tears </strong></h2> <p>New Yorkers have always liked Murray; they enjoy the variety he has and they appreciate the mental anguish he sometimes goes through on court. He has been a crowd favourite ever since he won the junior title in New York in 2004 but his speech at Wimbledon after losing to Federer in the final this summer turned an already favourable crowd into true believers. Sitting with some New York fans for the last set of Monday's final, they both mentioned how Murray's speech, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/jul/08/andy-murray-wimbledon-crowd-2012\" title=\"\">when he was fighting back the tears</a>, made him more human and easier to root for and when Djokovic began to fight back they were desperate for Murray to find a second wind. Murray responded, got them involved again and found the energy and the nerve to come through in that tense final set. When Djokovic took an injury time-out at 5-2 down in the decider, they were livid. When Murray won, they were ecstatic.</p>",

(The researchers also measured melatonin suppression after an hour of iPad use but found no statistically significant change).</p> <p>The study, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2012.07.008\" title=\"\">published recently</a> in the journal Applied Ergonomics, <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/08/30/sleeping-tablets-smartphones/\" title=\"\">has</a> <a href=\"http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-09-05/news/33623435_1_ipads-and-other-tablets-kindle-or-nook-melatonin\" title=\"\">received</a> a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2194806/Using-mobile-phones-tablets-bed-affecting-sleep-warn-scientists.html\" title=\"\">lot of</a> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9533249/Using-iPads-before-bed-can-lead-to-a-poor-nights-sleep.html\" title=\"\">attention</a> and has already led <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9508190/For-sleeps-sake-have-a-screen-break-before-bed.html\" title=\"\">commentators to plead for</a> a self-imposed break on computer use at night.</p> <p>However, Russell Foster, a professor of circadian neuroscience at the University of Oxford, is not convinced.</p> <p>For a start, he said, melatonin levels were not a good way to predict how much sleep someone will get.</p> <p>\"The relationship between melatonin and sleep is completely flawed,\" he said. \"Melatonin is not a sleep hormone \u2013 what it does is provide a biological representation of the dark. There is no empirical evidence that suggests that lower levels of melatonin will have a direct effect on the sleep axis.</p> <p>\"If you take melatonin, it can speed up the shifting effect of light on the clock and, in some people, has a slight sleep-inductive effect. Making the jump from the biology of what we know of melatonin to the effect it's having on sleep is completely flawed.\"</p> <p>The levels of light needed to suppress melatonin are an order of magnitude different from the amount of light needed to shift a person's body clock. In Figueiro's study, the participants experienced light exposure levels that ranged from 5 to 50 lux. Foster said a person would need around 500 to 1,000 lux to shift their circadian clocks.</p> <p>He said the issue at stake was an important one, namely the potential adverse effects of light and use of computer and television screens on sleep, the body's circadian system and brain alertness.</p> <p>\"Does this paper give us any empirical evidence of the effects of light on the clock? No it doesn't,\" he said. \"Extrapolating from these data into a more global effect can't be done.\"</p> <p>Foster advised people not to get unduly concerned as a result of Figueiro's research. \"On the basis of these data, we cannot say anything empirical about sleep; I wouldn't worry. The bigger issue of the impact of light, particularly before you go to bed, is serious \u2013 there may well be effects of light on alertness.\"</p> <p>One final thing that very few of the news reports on the research have mentioned: the study was funded by <a href=\"http://www.sharplabs.com/\" title=\"\">Sharp Laboratories of America</a>, the research organisation run by Sharp Corporation, the electronics company that makes TVs, PCs and tablets. They produced their own tablet in 2010 but subsequently dropped it and launched a new one in March, the catchily titled RW-T110.</p>",

  "<p>Andy Murray did not only extend Britain's post-Olympics euphoria by one more day when he clinched his first grand slam title in the small hours of Tuesday morning. Overnight, he saw his commercial earnings potentially triple as he catapulted himself into an elite sports sponsorship league occupied by stars such as David Beckham and Lewis Hamilton, experts say.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/11/andy-murray-us-open-novak-djokovic\" title=\"\">His heart-thumping victory over Novak Djokovic</a> at the US Open makes him the first British male grand slam champion for 76 years and, according to branding match-makers, that makes him a target for global sponsors itching for association with his sporting prowess.</p> <p>\"Off court, he could triple his earnings on the back of this, it is that significant,\" says Nigel Currie, director of Brand Rapport, whose clients include Jaguar and Vodafone. \"Golf and tennis are two of the richest and two of the most global sports, so when you reach the top in this sports, the possibilities are boundless,\" he said.</p> <p>The tennis ace's earnings are currently estimated at about \u00a37m or \u00a38m a year, but this could reach \u00a320 to \u00a325m within a year if he is carefully managed.</p> <p>Currie believes companies such as Gillette, which has sponsored Beckham, Tiger Woods and Thierry Henry, make a bee-line for people such as Murray because their global recognition delivers eyeballs in every corner of the world.</p> <p>\"I think it will be the big global brands, like the ones we have seen in the Olympics \u2013 the Samsungs, the Visas, the McDonald's and Coca-Colas that go for it,\" Currie says.</p> <p>Murray's sponsors currently include Adidas, Royal Bank of Scotland, the watch company Rado and Head, but in the elite league he can expect to have deals where he can just \"put his name to a portfolio of three or four partners who require very little input from the sports star\", Currie says.</p> <p>Those that know him however say he will not be getting a makeover or be \"buffed up\" in the manner of Beckham, who went from being a meek domestic footballing star to a global sex symbol, doing his bit for Calvin Klein underwear, among others.</p> <p>Murray is already in pole position to cash in on his new-found global stardom as he is represented by Simon Fuller, the svengali behind Beckham, his wife, Victoria, Lewis Hamilton and many others. A spokesman for Fuller's XIX Entertainment agency said: \"There's huge potential for Andy going forward. From the moment he won the Olympics gold, he began to impress and show the global audience what he is capable of. This is just the beginning.\"</p> <p>Could the timing of Murray's triumph be an issue? After all, he is joining a very crowded field for sports hero of the year, with a conveyor belt of stars delivered by the Olympics and Paralympics including Mo Farah, David Weir, Jessica Ennis and Bradley Wiggins.</p> <p>\"The fact that it's a crowded market isn't an issue. Bradley Wiggins has gone global but people like Jessica Ennis will remain UK properties and have minimum appeal in the global market,\" Currie says.</p> <p>And judging by Twitter on Monday night, Murray's already got an A-list following with celebrities including Russell Crowe, Sir Matthew Pinsent and Kevin Spacey in raptures about his performance.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/russellcrowe\" title=\"\">As Crowe tweeted</a>: \"Andy Murray on a roll. You champion.\"</p> <p>Those that know him say that Murray would \"run a mile\" from corporate sponsor days and that money isn't what motivates him.</p> <p>RBS has been a sponsor for the last 10 years but uses the association to promote Set4Sport, a community training initiative created by his tennis coach mother, Judy and based on the balance and agility games she taught Andy and Jamie as they were growing up.</p> <p>\"Both Andy and Jamie are great ambassadors.\" said a spokesman for RBS. \"It's amazing to think that what started out as child's play in Dunblane some 20 years ago, formed the foundations for last night's victory.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Violence begets violence</strong></p> <p>In the numb days between the Twin Towers attack and the US-led retaliation on Afghanistan, it felt like we hung in balance.

The article says \"\u2026 for some within this scene, strength is measured as the ability and willingness to engage in violent action against 'enemies'...\" The same deluded perception drove the US-led response to the Twin Towers attack and continues to drive much of western foreign policy today.</p> <p>The piece concludes that to guard against violent extremists, \"we must first start taking violence from the far right more seriously.\" Wrong.

Despite our good intentions and righteous views on the state of the world we continue to over-consume and thus prop up greedy empires.</p> <p>New Zealand also is busily engaged in legislating policies that promote the transfer of wealth to the \"haves\", largely ignoring climate issues, and cutting taxes and spending so that essential programmes are being reduced or eliminated.</p> <p>How can we oppose this apart from by using our vote? Many of us already know what needs to be done in our socially, environmentally, financially threatened societies, but we have to do more than argue the case, we have to walk the talk.</p> <p>And that is what I am doing (admittedly I have the luxury of living now a semi-retired, single and child-free life). I have renounced my car, computer, my landline phone, though kept my cellphone and (free) television.</p> <p>My lifestyle is minimalist. I eat carefully, I conserve resources, I walk or take public transport. I use the public library \u2013 an excellent communal resource in most centres \u2013 for computer use and internet access, and I borrow their DVDs, CDs and books. I help others (especially family) whatever way I can and nurture friendships. And I smile a lot.</p> <p>I want to be living proof that we can have a good enough life in our over-developed societies even if going without many \"essentials\"; we are nevertheless still very much better off materially than half the world.

Indeed, video advertising is appearing everywhere with ever-larger screens bombarding us with attractive deals.</p> <p>So I wonder about the \"German energy balancing act\" (31 August). Is it a choice between nuclear, fossil and renewables? That's definitely a hard one. But when we insist on using that precious energy (wherever it comes from) to power advertisements for the latest deodorants in our toilets, I really do groan with despair.</p> <p>Friends of mine spent many weekends demonstrating at the power stations pictured in your article. They held demos, built tree-houses and generally tried to raise awareness of madness of burning lignite (\"brown-coal\"), which is only marginally more efficient than burning peat. But they didn't get much coverage.</p> <p>I do support my friends' action at these power stations but often wonder whether it would make more sense to demonstrate in those places where we are burning energy to serve absolutely useless needs? For example, some of these hi-tech toilets and other public spaces where we are bombarded with intrusive advertising fed by electricity from the most damaging sources.<br><strong>Alan Mitcham </strong><br>Cologne, Germany</p> <p><strong>No going back for Arctic</strong></p> <p>When Arctic sea-ice levels finally hit the anticipated record low recently (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">31 August</a>), I felt a mixture of fear and panic. Trend lines on graphs of sea-ice extent show the Arctic could be ice-free as early as September 2015 and almost certainly by 2020. With more exposed ocean absorbing more radiation and less ice to reflect it, a positive feedback mechanism has been set in train.</p> <p>There are already reports of extensive methane releases from collapsing subsea permafrost on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. Methane is, of course, a potent greenhouse gas. Now a study published in the journal Nature reveals that a less studied form of permafrost, Yedoma, along the 7,000km coast of northern Siberia, is releasing 10 times more carbon into the Arctic Ocean than previously thought. Not only is the Yedoma permafrost thawing in the higher temperatures, it is also subject to enhanced wave and wind erosion brought on by the longer ice-free season, causing it to collapse and release even more methane.</p> <p>Regrettably, President Obama has now given permission to Shell to drill for oil off the northern Alaskan coast in protected habitat critical to the survival of polar bears. This, even before a vital oil-spill containment vessel received its certification. The decision puts wildlife in terrible danger as any oil spill will be almost impossible to clean up.</p> <p>As the Centre for Biological Diversity says: \"Once the Arctic is ruined, there's no going back. Unique animals like polar bears, yellow-billed loons, eiders, walruses, whales and ice seals that have evolved over millions of years to survive in this frozen wilderness \u2013 and nowhere else \u2013 will be condemned to extinction.\"<br><strong>Jenny Goldie </strong><br>Michelago, NSW, Australia</p> <p><strong>Ration NHS for the elderly</strong></p> <p>It is high time that NHS rationing was introduced (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/31/nhs-rationing-risking-lives-doctors-leader\" title=\"\">7 September</a>) but not in the way that the UK government is attempting \u2013 simply cutting the budget and leaving it to doctors to cut their costs without proper direction.

  "<p>Since the droughts and concurrent spike in fossil fuel prices of 2007-2008, the cost of food has risen dramatically across the world. Foreign governments and investors in turn reacted by kicking off a global rush to secure land for agriculture. The purchase or long-term lease of millions of hectares in Africa, Asia and Latin America will transform global farming while investors promise food security.</p> <p>The reality for many of the world's poor, however, is that few of them will benefit. The parties to these land deals often completed them in secret and overlooked the concerns of local residents and farmers who had lived off the land for generations. Between the global demand for biofuels and the pressure to feed an expected 9 billion people by 2050, this huge shift in land use must both feed and fuel a growing world, yet respect the rights of small landowners who, through no fault of their own, lacked proof that they held rights to use these lands.</p> <p>The opaque conditions under which these available or empty lands abruptly switched ownership displaced some of the world's poorest families, destroyed lives, and disrupted many communities' food security. The outcry resulting from these murky land deals, from <a href=\"http://www.ms.dk/sw139019.asp\" title=\"\">Angola</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/jun/01/china-land-deal-unease-argentina-agribusiness\" title=\"\">Argentina</a>, has sparked passionate activism from many NGOs who now provide a voice to the world's landless poor.</p> <p>To that end, the <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/\" title=\"\">United Nations</a> earlier this year approved the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security. Circumlocutory title aside, the guidelines offer a framework by which foreign investors can pursue deals and manage these lands in a way that both boosts agricultural capacity and maintains the rights and needs of local communities. Investors have awakened to the fact that securing the rights of local landowners is not only the morally correct stance, but a smart business decision in the long run.</p> <p>One organisation dedicated to the protection of small landowners is <a href=\"http://landesa.org/\" title=\"\">Landesa</a>, a Seattle-based NGO that has worked on land rights for 40 years. Darryl Vhugen, a senior attorney at Landesa, explained that work to bolster land rights should begin the moment such transactions are negotiated. With biofuels, standards such as those of the <a href=\"http://rsb.epfl.ch/\" title=\"\">Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels</a> (RSB) provide requirements that land deals must follow to guarantee local environmental and cultural sustainability. On farming issues, other multistakeholder initiatives including the World Economic Forum's <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/issues/agriculture-and-food-security\" title=\"\">New Vision for Agriculture</a> earned the buy-in of large food companies that have pledged to pursue responsible land investment and agriculture.</p> <p>Despite the global business community's increased focus on land rights, Vhugen said: \"at this point, the devil is in the implementation.\" No matter how attentive a multinational such as Unilever or Nestle is to land rights, several issues confront businesses that commit to responsible agriculture overseas.</p> <p>First, the legal infrastructure within the countries in which these land transactions have occurred is often weak. In addition, the implementation of a responsible land investment policy is a challenge because of the lack of effective governance. Therefore local capacity to carry out proper assessments is an uphill battle due to the lack of trained professionals who can monitor such land deals.</p> <p>Knowledge silos that emerge between businesses, government agencies and civil societies also create a barrier to the enforcement of effective land rights policies. Vhugen explained that in addition to those multisector silos, multidisciplinary silos also have a negative impact on local farmers' ability to hold onto their lands. The lack of communication and collaboration between water experts, human rights advocates, food security experts and sustainable agriculture specialists is that the most overriding problem, the right to fair and secure land title, falls on the wayside.</p> <p>The progressive and proactive companies, said Vhugen, are the ones that invest in both the land and people. According to Vhugen, large commercial farming alone will not feed the planet, so small farmers are also key to ensuring food security across the globe. An approach such as nucleus farming, in which large parcels are leased out while surrounding small farmers still till their land, will benefit investors, locals and the environment. Companies that manage large parcels of land could share innovative water and irrigation technologies with local farmers, which would then strengthen communities and boost the yields of small farms.</p> <p>Such a land use strategy is both smart business and wise land stewardship. In developing countries subjected to the global land rush, one factor behind exhausted soil and depleted water tables is insecure farmers' land rights. No farmer will commit to smarter irrigation practices, invest in expensive but lucrative fruit trees or commit to techniques such as agroforestry if they are unsure about their right to their families' land in a year's time. Therefore, if that family must move, the environmental problems simply become someone else's task.</p> <p>Many of these \"land grab\" deals are already completed and cannot be undone. But what investors can do is engage, not evict, the locals, and invest in their future. The results will be not only a more fair and humane policy, but prosperity for everyone who has a stake in these lands.</p> <p><em>Leon Kaye is founder and editor of </em><a href=\"http://greengopost.com/\" title=\"\"><em>GreenGoPost.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

Many of the protesters have previously been involved in similar environmental protests such as the Camp for Climate Action against Kingsnorth coal power station and the third runway at Heathrow.</p> <p>A Shell spokesman said: \"Shell recognises that certain organisations are opposed to our Arctic exploration programme and respect the right of individuals and organisations to engage in a free and frank exchange of views about our operations. We only ask that they do so with their safety and the safety of others, including Shell personnel and customers in mind.\"</p> <p>Shell also added: \"Shell has support from a multitude of stakeholders for our plans to execute a safe and environmentally responsible drilling programme in Alaska's Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Shell's distinguished offshore record in Alaska, including our prior drilling activities, validates that we are well positioned to work in the Arctic.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, this week ice scientists are expected to announce a record low for the Arctic sea ice minimum, following <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">unprecedented melting rates in the region this summer</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The Financial Services Authority has continued its post-Lehman Brothers crackdown on firms which fail to protect their clients' money by slapping a \u00a39.5m fine on fund management firm BlackRock.</p> <p>The fine, which would have been \u00a313.6m if the firm had not agreed to settle, is the latest attempt by the City regulator to prevent a rerun of the problems incurred when Lehman collapsed and where client money was not segregated from the firms' own money.</p> <p>The two are required to be kept separate to make it easier to hand money back to clients in the event that firms need to be wound up.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/static/pubs/final/blackrock.pdf\" title=\"\">FSA found</a> that the average daily balance of money market deposits at risk at BlackRock between 1 October 2006 and 31 March 2010 was over \u00a31.3bn.</p> <p>\"This is not the first time we have seen the impact on client money overlooked as part of a re-organisation. The fine imposed today should remind all firms of the critical importance we place on ensuring proper protection of client money at all times,\" said Tracey McDermott, FSA director of enforcement and financial crime.</p> <p>The fine is the second largest levied by the FSA for this offence following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/03/jp-morgan-fined-33m-by-fsa\" title=\"\">the \u00a333m fine JP Morgan paid after failing to protect clients for seven years</a>.</p> <p>The FSA admitted that BlackRock's misconduct was not deliberate and took place after \"organisation and systems changes\" following the acquisition of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers in September 2006.</p> <p>BlackRock had filed to obtain letters from banks with which it placed short-term deposits to ensure that client money was protected.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/21/barclays-sell-stake-blackrock\" title=\"\">Until May, Barclays held a 20% stake in BlackRock</a> as a result of the sale of its Barclays Global Investors division to the US-based firm in 2009.</p> <p>\"Identifying and protecting client money should be at the top of every firm's agenda. We have repeatedly emphasised to firms that their systems and controls for ensuring this is the case must be robust and well designed and updated as circumstances change,\" said McDermott.</p> <p>\"Despite being part of one of the largest asset managers in the world, BlackRock's systems were simply not adequate, and the basic step of notifying banks that the money was held on trust for clients was not done.\"</p> <p>BlackRock said it had reported the matter to the FSA after an internal review: \"As the FSA itself noted, the situation that led to this settlement was not deliberate and no clients suffered any losses as a result of the error. Still, we regret this instance where our UK procedures regarding money market deposits for a number of our clients were not consistent with applicable standards, and we are pleased to have fully resolved this matter with the FSA and that the matter is now closed.\"</p>",

That's right, people, if you lose your job and have to claim unemployment benefits, you'll inevitably get up the duff and smoke through your pregnancy. What is this? Kilroy?<br>I'm incredibly shocked that Iris thought this was fit not only to represent their agency to new employees, but in the trade press as well (because they've clearly sent it to Campaign themselves).

On the Institute for Government blog, Peter Thomas asks <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/4849/who-wants-to-be-a-senior-civil-servant/?source=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Publicsectorblogs+%28PublicSectorBlogs%29\" title=\"\">Who wants to be a senior civil servant</a>? Downsizing, a dwindling sense of personal achievement and continuous criticism from ministers, advisers and select committees may all be factors in recent departures of high profile senior civil servants, he suggests:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Downsizing at this scale and pace inevitably takes a toll on the capacity, energy and emotions of managers and senior leaders. The requirements of consultation, selection for redundancy, matching remaining staff to the remaining posts create a huge management burden on line managers. Overstretched HR functions are left with little capacity to do anything else. It is draining to run comprehensive downsizing programmes.<br>Civil Service managers and their much abused HR colleagues deserve credit for managing big reductions in staff \u2013 up to 30% in little more than 15 months. With the support of the better trade unions this has generally been done as fairly and humanely as you could expect given the pace of reductions.<br>Some who saw this phase through have already seized their voluntary redundancy or even resigned with a sense of relief and sometimes glee \u2013 depending on their age, their ability to get another job, or the respective sizes of their redundancy package, savings and pension.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the public leaders network Kevin Lloyd explains <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/11/civil-service-whitehall-voluntary-redundancy\" title=\"\">why he left the civil service</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't regret leaving. What I observe about further change in Whitehall suggests that much of it would not have been positive from my perspective. What, for instance, are the consequences of the well-publicised suggestion that ministers should have a say in annual appraisals and the emergence of ministers on departmental boards that will be considering a whole range of organisational arrangements?<br>It is probably not too fanciful to see the odd sign that being a civil servant, certainly at very senior levels, is now viewed by some less as a vocation and a career and more as a philanthropic gesture once the hard yards have been done in business or finance.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Lloyd will be on the panel for a public leaders discussion on Thursday about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/06/civil-service-talent-getting-out\" title=\"\">whether the civil service is failing its talent</a></p> <p>\u2022 Defining <strong>social enterprise</strong>. Following the news that computing specialist Salesforce.com has given up an effort to trademark the term \"social enterprise,\" David Floyd on his Beanbags and Bullsh!t blog admits he is <a href=\"http://beanbagsandbullsh1t.com/2012/09/09/may-salesforce-be-with-you/\" title=\"\">sceptical about the idea that we need a definition of social enterprise</a>. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Frankly, I couldn't care less if, at various points in the past, woolly definition of social enterprise has led to private sector businesses receiving some free business planning training or a free Business Link mouse-mat. It's more of an issue when there's important services and serious cash involved.<br>There's also the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012, which will come in force next year. While being a social enterprise is no guarantee of providing additional social value, and not being a social enterprise is no guarantee of not providing additional social value, it seems likely that the fact that an organisation is a social enterprise may be a factor in commissioners' considerations under the act.<br>The growth of the social investment market \u2013 however skeptical some of us might be about the way it's currently developing \u2013 is another good reason for 'a social enterprise' to be defined for tax purposes.<br>I think the time has come for clear, inclusive legal definition that enables organisations to register as 'a social enterprise' and be regulated accordingly. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>\u2022 An interesting piece on <strong>mental health and the internet</strong> by Vanessa Bartlett for Mind's blog. She offers <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/blog/7350_rules_of_engagement_mental_health_and_the_internet\" title=\"\">advice on dealing with sensitive subjects in an online environment</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I started my own blog Group Therapy in April 2010, after suffering intermittent bouts of depression across a period of years. Although I had reached a point where I was ready to start externalising some of my experiences, telling close family and friends how I was really feeling was still too daunting. So I told the internet instead.<br>Two years after starting my blog, I am completing a research qualification where I am considering the value of using online writing to help with mental health issues. During my studies, I have found plenty of evidence to suggest that confiding in a computer can be just as intimate as talking to a therapist.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>(thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpenceratUKCP\" title=\"\">Spencer Gasson</a> for the link)</p> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19548597\" title=\"\">UK schools 'most socially segregated'</a><br>\u2022 Children &amp; Young People Now: <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1074587/parental-alcohol-misuse-more-damaging-drugs-warns-childrens-commissioner\" title=\"\">Parental alcohol misuse 'more damaging than drugs', warns children's commissioner</a><br>\u2022 CivilSociety: <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/13346/boris_johnson_appoints_former_evening_standard_editor_as_volunteering_adviser\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson appoints former Evening Standard editor as volunteering adviser</a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/blogs/social-work-blog/2012/09/why-social-work-students-shoul.html\" title=\"\">Why social work students should read newspapers</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/how-cleggs-growth-fund-makes-jobs--at-200000-a-time-8122411.html\" title=\"\">How Clegg's growth fund makes jobs \u2013 at \u00a3200,000 a time</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/development/%E2%80%98radical-tax-reform%E2%80%99-needed-to-fix-housing-market/6523669.article\" title=\"\">'Radical tax reform' needed to fix housing market</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=106873\" title=\"\">LEPs need more private sector help to succeed</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/09/nhs-unions-must-be-creative-and-brave-to-keep-national-pay/\" title=\"\">NHS unions must be 'creative and brave' to keep national pay</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9534107/Check-your-sons-bedrooms-for-knives-says-father-of-boy-stabbed-at-Facebook-party.html\" title=\"\">Check your sons' bedrooms for knives, says father of boy stabbed at Facebook party</a><br>\u2022 Third Sector: <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/Fundraising/article/1149098/remember-charity-launches-plaques-recognise-projects-made-possible-legacy-giving/\" title=\"\">Remember A Charity launches plaques to recognise projects made possible by legacy giving</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian weekly section</h2> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>It's no real secret that much of the most exciting and innovative game design work is being done in the indie sector these days. While mainstream publishers stack their chips behind safe brands and long running licenses, smaller studios and lone coders are continuing to explore the wider, more surreal possibilities of the medium. </p> <p>The past month in particular has seen an astonishing range of indie releases across all formats and genres. Here are ten examples you should really check out before \u2013 or perhaps instead of \u2013 the Triple A Christmas hits to come.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.markoftheninja.com\">Mark of the Ninja</a> (Xbox Live Arcade)</strong></h2> <p>From the creators of the brilliantly deranged brawler, Shank, this stealth platformer is effectively every eighties Ninja flick rolled into one engrossing adventure. Players must traverse a series of environments, using firecrackers to distract enemies, crawling through vents, avoiding guard dogs and killing silently with throwing stars. The action is depicted via lovely cell-shaded visuals, the complex background designs bringing a real sense of depth to the single plain gameplay. If you thought Shadow Complex was the pinnacle of scrolling 2D gameplay on Xbox 360, you may need to think again.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.smudgedcat.com/gateways.htm\">Gateways</a> (PC, Xbox 360)</strong></h2> <p>If you loved Portal 2 and have already finished Kim Swift's ideological follow-up, Quantum Conundrum, this is the one for you. Gateways is a 2D platformer in which a mad scientist must escape his lab using a gateway gun that shoots traversable portals onto flat surfaces. Instead of simply cribbing Valve's masterful physics puzzler, however, developer Smudged Cat has added a range of different guns, including one that shrinks or enlarges the inventor as he passes through and another that allows him to time travel. It's mind bending stuff, wonderfully designed to inhabit one enormous level and a real treat for gamers seeking a well-crafted intellectual challenge. Available on PC via Steam or Desura, and on the Xbox Live Indie Games service.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://superhexagon.com/\">Super Hexagon</a> (iOS)</strong></h2> <p>Game writers are calling this the cruellest game ever made, but Terry Cavanagh's minimalist blipvert of a puzzler is also magical in its Zen-like purity. The set up is simple \u2013 you control an arrow as it rotates left and right, trying to find the small gaps in a series of incoming hexagons; if the walls of the shape touch you, you're dead. That's it. Sessions are frantic, chaotic and confusing, often lasting little more than a few seconds, but you'll be compelled to continue because this is effectively game design compulsion at its most cleanly distilled. The pulsating visuals and rousing chiptune soundtrack add to the almost hypnotic onslaught, and the global leader board will compel fanatics to continue through the rage barrier. This game made Guardian contributor Simon Parkin so angry, he <a href=\"http://www.hookshotinc.com/exposing-super-hexagon-creators-lies-investigative-journalism-special/\">wrote a fictional revenge drama</a> in response. Few games do that to people. </p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://hermitgames.com/qrthphyl.php\">Qrth-Phyl</a></strong> (PC, Xbox)</h2> <p>Indie coder Matt James wrote the conceptually wonderful Leave Home, a shooter about growing up and coming of age. Now he has re-invented the Nokia classic Snake (or if your influences go back further, Blockade) for a new age. In this mesmerising puzzler, available on PC and the Xbox Live Indie Games service, you control a sort of snake-like space craft as it gobbles energy balls on a series of hallucinogenic space platforms, growing larger with every meal. Hit a wall or your own tail and you lose a life, finish off enough dots and you open up a new realm. The visuals swap between 2D planes and 3D environs, and the levels are emergent, building themselves on the fly so the challenge is different every time. It's just so clever and so gorgeous to look at, and it is as challenging to play as the title is to pronounce. </p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.retroaffect.com/games/1/Snapshot/\">Snapshot</a> (PC)</strong></h2> <p>The latest masterwork from indie gaming prodigy <a href=\"http://kpulv.com/\">Kyle Pulver</a> is a neat puzzle platformer featuring a super cute robot whose camera can capture objects and then re-materialise them in other places. Need to reach a high platform? Take a snap of a crate and then stick your photo next to the ledge. Photos can also be manipulated or taken from different angles to solve specific puzzles, so prepare to dust down your lateral thinking powers. It sounds complex, but the interface is so seamless and the worlds so beautifully drawn, you quickly attune to the logic of the universe.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.thomaswasalone.com/\">Thomas Was Alone</a> (PC/Mac)</strong></h2> <p>A narrative adventure, told in 2D and with shapes instead of human characters. That's essentially the idea behind Mike Bithell's blocky odyssey following a collection of sentient sprites as they navigate the interior of a computer, forming friendships along the way. In a way, it's another platformer, but featuring a rather touching narration from Danny Wallace it somehow becomes a somewhat cinematic quest, touching and funny, and still functioning perfectly as an abstract puzzle. Not bad for an idea that Bithell originally developed and prototyped in just 24 hours. </p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://blendogames.com/thirtyflightsofloving/\">Thirty Flights of Loving</a> (PC)</strong></h2> <p>Big Triple A titles like Uncharted and Call of Duty aspire to cinema through their use of narrative sequences and epic visuals, but they rarely engage with the form and methodology of the medium. This surreal first-person heist game, which can be played and completed in barely 15 minutes, does amazingly clever things with editing and character perspective, grabbing players from the first moment to the fade out, despite the lack of dialogue and the expressionistic design. Play this game now because in years to come people may point back and say that's where video game story telling changed forever.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://closuregame.com\">Closure</a> (PC)</strong></h2> <p>Developed by a three-man team at Eyebrow Interactive, this creepy monochrome puzzler has you controlling a weird alien creature that must navigate a junk-strewn underworld using light beams as traversable pathways. Nothing in this environment exists while in dark, and plunging into the inky blackness means death, so everything from locating and manipulating objects, to reaching the end of each stage is governed by how you manipulate light. It's atmospheric and deliciously gothic, reminding some of Playdead's Limbo; and out there in the void, there is a strange story to uncover...</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.noogy.com/main.html\">Dust: An Elysian Tail</a> (Xbox Live Arcade)</strong></h2> <p>Released in mid-August to huge critical acclaim, Dust is an ambitious action RPG crafted by one coder, Dean Dodrill, who took over three years to complete it. Eponymous hero Dust must traverse a beautiful hand-drawn world, battling enemies and gaining XP. Hardly revolutionary stuff, of course, but the intricate yet accessible combat system and lavish environments really set this apart from conventional mainstream RPG hits. A true spiritual progeny of Castlevania and Metroid.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.weareminority.com/\">Papo and Yo</a> (PlayStation Network)</strong></h2> <p>Very few video games are autobiographical, and few attempt to deal with real-life tragedy or trauma. The beguiling adventure title Papo and Yo, however, handles both. It is effectively about creator Vander Caballero's childhood with an alcoholic and abusive father \u2013 except in the game, the father is a monster who must be controlled and tamed by the lead character so that he is no longer a danger to his friends. It is a game that's both emotionally fascinating and utterly compelling as a ludic experience. It is the anti-Call of Duty. At times it represents what everyone in the industry must aspire to if people are going to refer to games as an artform without others sniggering derisively.</p>",
  "<p>Eskimo is said \u2013 incorrectly \u2013 to have a dozen words for snow but cryologists have a vast lexicon of terms for different types of ice. Strangely, many are associated with food and cooking.</p> <p>According to the Mariners' Handbook, the bible of British Admiralty publications, the first new sea ice of the season is known as shuga ice which, depending on the temperature, salinity and snowfall, may coalesce to become frazil ice, grease ice or even slush ice.</p> <p>As temperatures drop, and the sea ice becomes older and takes on different shapes from the wind and the currents, it acquires a host of other names. Ice formed in the first season is called young, or first year ice, and includes rind ice and nilas ice \u2013 which looks like long thin glass sheets \u2013 as well as pancake ice and cake ice.</p> <p>Sea ice is either fast ice \u2013 which does not move around \u2013 or drift ice which does. But as we've seen this week, there's also brash ice, multi-year ice, heavily ridged ice and pack ice, open, close and very close ice, as well as grey, grounded, hostile, hummocked, rotten and consolidated ice. Not forgetting ice bergs and ice floes. Different ice forms may contain polynyas, sastrugi, rams and rimes and you can have bergy bits, finger-rafting, growlers, breccia and ice blinks. All have different properties, shapes, sizes and formations.</p> <p>It's specialised stuff. Sea ice experts might regularly say things like: \"Do you know there is a polynya in the Laptek sea?\" But permafrost folk who know land-based ice would not understand. Instead, one might respond: \"Do you mean a pingo?\"</p> <p>Cambridge sea ice scientist Nick Toberg adds two Russian terms which he says are not in the British vocabulary but are widely used. One is stamukha, sea ice that has run ashore, and the other is ropak, a vertical slab.</p> <p>So <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/sep/06/history-sea-greenpeace-arctic-sunrise\" title=\"\">here on the Arctic journey I embarked on last week aboard Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel</a>, you really do need a pilot who understands his ice to navigate. We have Arne Sorensen, a Dane who has spent 30 years captaining ice-breaking ships with the Australian Navy, Greenpeace and others way up north of Greenland.</p> <p>He's seen the northern polar ice rapidly change in the summer months.</p> <blockquote> \"The line marked on many maps as 'permanent ice' is really just a line of averages, as far as it normally recedes. In the past when it had receded to that line it was roughly half old ice and half first-year ice. Now, no more than one-third or a quarter, is old ice. I would say roughly half the ice by area and possibly 75% by volume has now gone.\" </blockquote> <p>When you travel through sea ice, he says, you first judge its thickness by seeing how much sticks out of the water, like with an iceberg when they say that 90% is below the water line. The higher it is out of the water, the thicker it is. And the older it is, the harder it usually is because the salts drain out and it compacts. But, he says, it's not necessarily old just because it's thick, and vice versa.</p> <blockquote> \"Then, he says you judge the colour. If its blueish, its probably older ice. Young ice is full of sharp angles. Older ice is more rounded because of the melt. Young ice can still be thick because of the pressure ridges which form where the ice is compressed together. Older ice is smoothed at the edges by the wind and the waves. <br> \"The further into the ice you go, the quieter it gets. We are looking for stable ice - old ice at least two metres thick [for the scientists and Greenpeace to work on].\" </blockquote> <p>It helps if the ice pilot knows his ship, too. Sorensen knows the Arctic Sunrise better than most. He has captained it many times and was partly responsible for Greenpeace buying it in 1997 and converting it from a sealing ship.</p> <p>He's confident of it in most ice conditions. \"It can break ice that is at least 50cm thick and keep going. It's best at making a path through substantial floes,\" he says.</p> <p>Which is just what we've been doing for the last 24 hours.</p>",
  "<p>Subliminal information can trigger the placebo effect and its opposite, the nocebo effect, researchers say.</p> <p>The finding suggests that patients with certain ailments may feel better or worse depending on subtle cues their brains pick up from the environment, but which they are not consciously aware of.</p> <p><a href=\"http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/profiles/profile/person/89071\" title=\"MGH: Karin Jensen\">Karin Jensen</a>, who led the study at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said the work had implications for how doctors interact with their patients and how healthcare is delivered.</p> <p>The placebo effect is the curious biological mechanism whereby patients' symptoms improve when they take fake medicines with no active ingredient, such as sugar pills or saline injections. It also boosts the effectiveness of genuine medicines.</p> <p>Though placebo is the better known effect, there is an opposite reaction, called the nocebo response, where people can feel worse after an intervention that should have no ill effects.</p> <p>While both are usually linked to a tangible intervention the patient is aware of, Jensen's team wondered whether subconscious cues might be enough to trigger the same effects.</p> <p>\"It's been a dominant theory in placebo research that in order to elicit these responses you should be pretty aware of the suggestion being made that you are going to get better. People weren't opposing the idea of unconscious processing, it just hadn't been investigated properly,\" she said.</p> <p>The scientists recruited 40 healthy volunteers for the study and hooked them up to a heating element that could inflict various levels of heat, and so pain, at the researchers' whim.</p> <p>In the training phase of the study, each volunteer watched a computer screen that flashed up two men's faces, one at a time, over and over again. For each volunteer, one face was accompanied by a severe heat shock, the other with a much lesser shock. Both men wore neutral expressions and the pictures appeared for 100 milliseconds.</p> <p>In the second part of the study, the device was set to deliver a moderate level of pain every time, halfway between the high and low pain of the training phase.</p> <p>The volunteers were then split into two groups. The first group saw faces flash up on the screen as before, along with a third neutral face, and were asked to rate their pain each time. The heat level was the same for everyone.</p> <p>As expected, the level of pain they experienced depended on which face they saw. The \"high pain\" face from training made them feel more pain (nocebo), while the \"low pain\" face made them report less pain (placebo). The neutral face elicited pain midway between the two.</p> <p>The reaction of the second group was more intriguing. They saw the same faces for only 12 milliseconds - too short a time for the brain to consciously process the information - before the images were scrambled and masked. But despite this, they showed the same placebo and nocebo response as the first group. The pain rose or fell depending on the face that appeared on screen, but without them knowing which face it was.</p> <p>\"The work shows that processes like placebo and nocebo happen without us being aware of the cues that trigger them,\" said Jensen. \"We get these responses due to associative learning. We don't need somebody standing there saying 'ok, now you will feel less pain'. It's being elicited naturally, and without us being aware, all the time.\"</p> <p>The study appears in <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1202056109\" title=\"PNAS: Nonconscious activation of placebo and nocebo  pain responses \">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cell.com/neuron/retrieve/pii/S0896627304007913\" title=\"Neuron: Individual Differences in Trait Anxiety Predict the Response of the Basolateral Amygdala to Unconsciously Processed Fearful Faces\">Previous work</a> has highlighted areas of the brain, particularly the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala\" title=\"\">amygdala</a>, that might be involved in such subconscious processing of information.</p> <p>\"The next step for us is to tease apart any possible clinical implications for this,\" Jensen said. \"We know from this study that it's happening, so for sure it's happening in a clinical context too. Awareness of these processes is very useful for the doctor-patient relationship, and the procedures around the delivery of healthcare.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.personalweb.unito.it/fabrizio.benedetti/sitolab/index.html\" title=\"Fabrizio Benedetti\">Fabrizio Benedetti</a>, who works on the placebo effect at Turin Medical School, said: \"In <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12764120\" title=\"Journal of Neuroscience: Conscious expectation and unconscious conditioning in analgesic, motor, and hormonal placebo/nocebo responses.\">2003</a> we showed totally unconscious placebo responses for hormone secretion, but with the present study we now know that an unconscious mechanism holds true for pain as well.</p> <p>\"This means that our behaviour and emotional experiences are often guided by stimuli out of our consciousness. Once again, the placebo response is emerging as an excellent model to understand how our brain works and how mental events interact with neural events.\"</p>",
  "<p>Well as you can see I am a lot shorter than people might expect. Television exaggerates people's heights so to give you some idea of my actual height take my measure against this podium here. This podium is one foot high, so that gives you an idea. Thank-you very much, Bafta, for your incredible kindness in not only inviting me to give this year's Television Lecture, but of laying on such a magnificent parade through central London leading up to it. I know how deeply the British public share our concerns about the digital future and the challenge of multi-platform delivery, which is why I'm sure they turned out in the large numbers they did this afternoon.</p> <p>Now, my predecessor in this spot, Peter Bennett-Jones, argued last year that the BBC needs to be split into two divisions, one factual, and one entertainment. Indeed, many in the crowd in Trafalgar Square were telling me the same today \u2026 and I'll be taking Peter's advice tonight, and speaking just about comedy and drama, since that's what I feel qualified to discuss. I also ought to point out that Peter is my agent so I suppose it's appropriate he gets a 10% share of my argument this evening.</p> <p>But I dedicate tonight's lecture 100% to him. He's been my mentor and model for nearly 20 years now, fighting to help me make the comedy I wanted to make under the creative conditions I needed to make it, and his generosity, idealism and idiosyncrasy for me represent totally what we are in UK Television when we are at our best. Especially the idiosyncrasy.</p> <p>This lecture has the rather aggressive title of 'Fight, Fight, Fight'. And to show I mean business, I also ought to warn you that I use the F-word three times this evening, and by that I mean 'Fuck'. And that was one of them.</p> <p>I had originally thought of calling tonight's talk 'Make Good Programmes' and the plan was to be introduced, come over to the lectern and say, 'Good evening. Make good programmes' and then sit down again. But that would only have led to an awkward silence, followed by everyone heading downstairs to a glass of rather sharp-tasting white wine and then, with a free evening ahead of them, no doubt heading over to a rival talk Brian Sewell is giving on Titian at The National Gallery.</p> <p>But 'Make Good Programmes' is all I've ever believed, it's all I've ever want to believe. Don't underestimate the intelligence of your audience. Make good programmes, and they will come.</p> <p>My only working principle, whenever we make something, is rather ruthlessly to concentrate on that rectangular screen on the monitor as I'm filming. What's happening in that screen? Is it clear what's going on? Is what's in that monitor the funniest, the best it can be? Is it telling the story? Is it believable what those people are saying? And I will always fight to make it so, even if that means starting afresh, rewriting the scene, dropping an extremely expensive prop, ignoring a magnificent but distracting view the location manager sold his wife to get access to.</p> <p>All of that, because that rectangle is all the viewer cares about too. Whatever device that rectangle is on may keep changing, away from the home and onto the tablet, but it's still those same four sides enclosing what you've made. It's an intimate connection between you and them. There may be a hundred people on set, we may measure our reach in terms of millions, but ultimately people watch in ones and twos, and with families and friends. TV is personal.</p> <p>It's personal for me. When I was growing up in Glasgow my father was self-employed, and had good times and bad times. In the good times, we lived in a nice house, but there were bad times. There was a particularly bad time when there were six of us in a two-bedroomed tenement flat in Glasgow. But even then, I remember television taking us out of ourselves. Us all gathered round and there being laughter, at Morecombe and Wise and The Generation Game and Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em. But also great illumination, with the likes of The World at War and Horizon and a fantastic series I remember dramatising Charles Darwin's voyage on the Beagle to the Galapagos Islands, where he began his intellectual journey that was to lead to the development of his theory on evolution.</p> <p>I personally felt grateful that British TV set itself apart from its international rivals in this way, not afraid to challenge, to stretch the mind and imagination. It stretched mine, it galvanised my creative ambitions, it gave me a standard to reach for, which is why I feel happy making television, and grateful and thankful that I'm making it in Britain.</p> <p>That's why I've called this talk 'Fight, Fight, Fight', because I want to encourage us to be more aggressive in promoting what makes British TV so good. And to be ambitious, arrogant even, in how we sell it to the world. Never to sell ourselves short. And I'll be talking about my American experiences in a moment. But commercially, I want us all, especially the BBC, with a brand recognition up there with Apple and Google, to go abroad and prostitute itself to blue-buggery if need be in how it sells and makes money from its content, so that money can come back to production in the UK.</p> <p>But more importantly, at home, I want us to be more vocal in fighting whatever attacks or restricts our creative ambition. The caution, the assault from politicians and press barons, the unnecessary constraints imposed by any executives who commission in their own image, according to their own agenda of tastes and priorities, instead of in creative engagement with the programme makers,</p> <p>I want to banish forever the memory of a seminar a few years back, where a roomful of some of the best comedy writers in the country were told by executives, 'here's some of the topics we're looking for in comedy \u2026 Builders, women \u2026. No doubt they were inundated with scripts about a building firm who wanted to build a woman. I want to argue that programme makers, the creative industry in television, is its hugest asset, and will be the true source of any profit to come, and needs to be treated with respect and support.</p> <p>Now, profit, the weasel word, profit. I'm not a naturally aggressive person, but one of the few times I've spoken out in public about television was after James Murdoch spoke up in favour of profit, and attacked the BBC for being far too good. I was frustrated that the BBC started apologetically looking at reining in some of its services, and apologising for having websites and digital channels and local radio. And at the time I said publicly I loved the BBC dearly but I was frustrated that, every time it was accused of a crime, even one it wasn't guilty of, it would immediately hand itself in to the nearest police station. I also said the BBC should get someone to tell James Murdoch to fuck off, but it looks like that happened at the most recent MacTaggart Lecture [which was given by James' sister Elisabeth Murdoch].</p> <p>Now, it would take someone with a sick and twisted sense of humour to revel in the subsequent emotional distress that has befallen James Murdoch since he made that argument, which is why Bafta has asked me to give this lecture.</p> <p>But I want to look at that provocative remark he used at the end of his MacTaggart Lecture, that 'the only reliable, durable guarantor of independence is profit,'. That sentence riled me. It got to me. Not just because my first instincts were telling me it was the opposite of everything I believed, but also because of a niggling, troubling little emergency flare that went off at the back of my mind that perhaps there might be something in it. That independence is key. That creative independence is what defines British television at its best, but if it's under attack, where is it to go if not into the arms of the moneymen?</p> <p>Well, we'll see.</p> <p>So let's, first, take a look at the world stage. British television was once the most admired, the most copied and influential in the world. I say 'once' because I think over the past five, maybe 10, years we've stopped thinking that. We've been surprised and gob smacked by how good American telly has become.</p> <p>Bringing cinema production values to the small screen and attracting cinema talent. America's best writers and directors have been enticed to the longer-form TV drama and as a consequence have given us the likes of The Wire, Damages, The Walking Dead, Six Feet Under, Homeland, and Game of Thrones. Some of these series have been called the greatest television ever made. Which is silly, because that's Breaking Bad. Or is it Family Guy?</p> <p>My epiphany was when watching an episode of Battlestar Gallactica, not the '80s mullet version, but the high concept reboot from a few years back, where some of the central cast \u2013 held in captivity by the Cylons \u2013 resorted to suicide bombing to overthrow them. For an American show deep in America's War on Terror, this was an astonishing piece of bravado from the programme makers, and it made me sit up and think about how gloriously daring we could be with television drama.</p> <p>But American TV wasn't always to that standard. In the 1970s and '80s, that time when perhaps America's political and cultural dominance was at its height, and when Britain's great doubts about its identity and role were at their most pronounced, in those times we at least consoled ourselves with one unarguable, self-evident fact; American TV was glittery crap and ours was really, really good. Yes, there were iconic shows from the US like Kojak and The Mary Tyler Moore Show, but these were just well made entertainments at the very tippy-topmost peak of a mound of dross.</p> <p>We rejoiced in the vulgarity of their LA sheen, we enjoyed being appalled by the sausage-factory productivity, with regular, yearly seasons of 22 episodes or even more, typified by a famous Simpson's episode where Homer raises money to fund a new, seventh episode of his favourite British TV show,</p> <p>And we jumped up in down with barely concealed patronising glee that even a costume soap from us like Upstairs, Downstairs could be repackaged in America as Masterpiece Theatre. And we laughed, oh how we laughed, at their repeated attempts to take top quality British sitcoms like Fawlty Towers and make a complete shredded turkey out of them.</p> <p>And then, with The Sopranos we started identifying the appearance of quality, edgy television. We identified it with HBO. We maybe saw it as a one-off. After all, HBO's slogan 'It's not TV , it's HBO' reinforced this notion that what we were watching was somehow an exception. But now as rivals Showtime and AMC and FX ape HBO's commitment to a different type of television, with the likes of Mad Men and Dexter, and as the big networks catch the bug with high-concept shows such as Lost and, dammit, The Office, I think in Britain TV has gone through something of an identity crisis.</p> <p>Why is this? Firstly, I think the increasing power and dominance of the commissioning executive (and by that I mean either genre commissioner or channel controller or scheduler \u2013 an executive who has some say in the commissioning of programmes) I think the increasing power and dominance they've had is partly to blame for this. Separating broadcasters from programme-makers gave those broadcasters a power that has grown and grown so that at times it becomes a form of diktat as to what the content should be.</p> <p>\"We want a animated sketch show about teenage car crash victims\"; \"We're looking for more dramas about superhero weathermen fighting permafrost\"; \" We're after a sassy late-night antiques show\"; \"We want a multi-ethnic quiz hosted by an Indian Amanda Burton.\"</p> <p>Too often, the commissioning executive became the chief creative officer behind any show, the one coming up with the title, insisting on the key cast, determining the format, imposing hard-line notes on the script, influencing the edit. Very often the producers and key creative talent became the suppliers, the contracted creative labour, used to bring the commissioner's project to completion.</p> <p>We were told we, the programme makers, were there to make headlines, grab ratings, pull in the viewers, or 'punch through the mix' as I remember one memo put it. The discovery that reality was popular and cheap let to a downturn in drama and comedy, and an upswing in that colossally twattish decade of programmes that described their entire contents in their title. Top Ten Celebrity Mingers, remember that? The Boy Who Can Burp His Own Kidneys. Help Me, My Sister's a Pope.</p> <p>Apologies if you've heard this before, but I just think it typifies what was going on. I worked for Talkback, which was a comedy company, but then became much more successful making reality shows, and it produced House Doctor \u2013 one of its hits. Someone working at Talkback had decided that they were going to leave, and it was a brainstorming session for spin-off ideas from House Doctor. People were chucking in Garden Doctor, people were saying: 'Garden Doctor, fantastic, people go into gardens, do them up, sell them, improve the house'. School Doctor: 'fantastic, people go into schools, they turn them round, whatever'. Body Doctor: 'fantastic, people go in and \u2026' at which point my friend, who was about to leave, stood up and said 'that's a fucking doctor'. Now, thankfully, the worst of those days are behind us but I do think we still expend too much of our energy trying to second-guess what the executives are after.</p> <p>In comedy, for example, the agenda kept changing with a set of circular twists and turns more dizzying than the ones that got our gymnasts a bronze at the Olympics. Commissioners and controllers saying there's too much single camera comedy on these days and they want some more studio audience sitcoms.</p> <p>And then along comes Gavin and Stacey, which proves the audience sitcom is dead so we don't need any more thanks. And then along comes Miranda and the appeal goes out once more audience sitcoms just like that. And then along comes The Inbetweeners.</p> <p>It seems to go in cycles of four years. And yet controllers and commissioners seems to come and go every two years, so the cycle gets disrupted by another cycle inside the bigger cycle, until no one knows what we're meant to be making and everyone is just sick.</p> <p>I honestly don't think that this was the commissioning executive's fault; it was more a symptom of the dysfunctional nature of the job. Pressure on that exec to get the commission right, to get the ratings and the awards and the conversational buzz, against all competition. And that inevitably pushes them into wanting final say on all aspects of the programme. The more they have their say, however, the less say there is from the creative team.</p> <p>On top of all this, because drama and comedy is so expensive to make, I think there grew up a tendency to think, we were lucky to be making it at all. It was a 'beggars can't be choosers mentality' that gave the broadcaster the upper hand in dishing out notes and casting suggestions and schedule deadlines. It made it easier to say no without too much explanation. 'Sorry, we've already got a show set in a county with cars in it.'</p> <p>That's the nature of the dysfunction: it diminishes the use of the greatest resource in British Television, the fund of creative talent of writers and performers and producers, who made the greatest television in the world. The more limitations and constrictions we impose on that talent, the more British television is diminished.</p> <p>If we operate under a culture of caution and compliance, our TV industry will not flow at full strength, at a time when it has to. I've been lucky enough to have had several chances of working with American broadcasters, and I've had contrasting experiences.</p> <p>There was a US Version of The Thick of It, which was piloted at ABC, and there I saw first-hand the network system. The notes from every executive, meetings with a roomful of vice-presidents laid out in crescent formation in swinging chairs. Every decision on casting, location, the look, even the colour of the ties, (although I was allowed to have final decision on that one), but every other decision needed approval and sign-off from above.</p> <p>Then flash forward three years and my experiences making Veep with HBO. There, the conversations were direct, focused. Most heartening, the whole experience was about forming a creative relationship, a dialogue, with the programme maker. Their first words to me were, 'we like what you do, why would we want to change it?' Yes, there were notes and talks, but these were always supportive suggestions. If there was ever a difference of opinion over a decision, word would always come back: 'it's your show. It's up to you,'.</p> <p>That's an extraordinary contrast, and it's tempting to conclude that the big networks just aren't the place to go to do the type of shows that we make here, the idiosyncratic personal stuff, the typically British stuff. But I think that's wrong. Good stuff is made by the networks and the mistake in the end was ours for thinking that, though we came up with the programme idea, we weren't best equipped to make it ourselves. We didn't big ourselves up enough in the process. In fact, as my experience with Veep has borne out, confidence in our own ability pays dividends. Veep, though shot in America, with an American cast, has an all-British team of writers, all-British directors, all-British post-production from start to finish \u2013 titles, music, editing. The cast even came to London to rehearse.</p> <p>It's a lesson I need to hold on to, it's one I've learnt. That we can make international television, but we need to make it our way because we have all the advantages of belonging to the best creative pool of talent in the world. The US comes to us for ideas because we have great ideas, but we are also the best equipped to make them.</p> <p>For me, Veep is a start, but it signals that it's possible, just possible, to enter not just a financial partnership with other countries, but a creative one as well. And we need to, because the market has become global, the potential audience, truly international.</p> <p>I want to break off ever so briefly to show you a clip, I was thinking \u2013 given that we're in the height of election fever over in the States \u2013 it would be good to see something funny about the American election and I scoured around various channels and networks and websites, and the thing that's made me laugh consistently is this clip, which is fairly self explanatory. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9L9A1IMTQo\" title=\"Spoof Mitt Romney YouTube clip\">So if we just watch this, and we'll talk about it afterwards</a>.</p> <p>There are three things I wanted to say about that clip, and I'll say them very quickly. I could actually do a whole lecture. Firstly, it was done on the internet, so nobody commissioned it, someone went and did it off their own bat. And that's an example of how the internet has given us creative tools to write, to create, to film, to test out ideas.</p> <p>It means that, whereas 20 years ago people were saying to me 'how do I start? How do I get into comedy?' and I would say to them 'well, you'll have to go along to a radio production, go to a writers' meeting of Weekending and see if you can write for that,' or 'have you got a script?'. Nowadays, people are giving me CDs and DVDs and web links, and the ability to create off your own bat means that actually there's now no excuse, if you want to become a member of the creative industry within television, there is now nothing stopping you in terms of going out and being able to enact your ideas. Now, obviously, some things take a little bit of money, and need a little bit of support and financial backing. But the ability to grab people, especially if what you make is good, I think is now greater. Secondly, that clip was made in the US, but I can access if here.</p> <p>The fact is that domestic audiences are becoming less and less attached to watching stuff made in their homeland, less and less attached to watching home-grown television. Are more ready to watch, no matter where it's made. For that reason British comedy is now far more popular in America than it's ever been, because people know where to access the stuff.</p> <p>They know where to find Inbetweeners and Peep Show. We just started, this week, The Thick of It has gone out in the UK, but it's now simultaneously going out on Hulu in America. We, in the UK, aren't too fazed by watching Nordic drama, we're not actually that fussed by where it's made, as long as it's good. And that's an interesting thing.</p> <p>Thirdly, I can watch that whenever I like. This removes the art of the scheduler, since scheduling becomes a personal gift to the viewer, who watches whatever they like. And I think, especially watching how the young view their television, or rather view content on YouTube on their laptop, on their phone, and have this expectation that they can access anything from anywhere in the world, and at any time they want it, I think that this inevitable revolution in viewing habits that people are frightened of is going to come upon us in the next three, four years.</p> <p>What that means, though, is that content is supreme. That the programme commissioner, the scheduler, the controller has less of a vital job and that the responsibility for coming up with good stuff is back with us. Across the world, the cry is up for content. People want good stuff, and they'll search anywhere to find it. Schedulers, networks are on the wane, and the makers of good stuff will be in the driving seat.</p> <p>And that's why it's great we belong to the best creative industry in the world, but also why it's essential that everyone, executives and producers, in British television prioritises good quality, challenging, imaginative programming because it's only by doing so will we play to our strengths and stand out from the competition.</p> <p>We are at our best not in committee, but when we're at our most idiosyncratic. The best British television is the vision of individual creative minds, responding to the values and events of the society around them. But it's not self-absorbed, it's genuinely part of the wider spirit of what's going on in a community, but a specific response to that spirit. It's a challenge, or a celebration of it, or a critique of it or an affirmation of it. Because it's individual, because it's personal, it communicates, it connects with the viewer. Commissioning executives are at their best when they give space and encouragement to these individual responses. When they fund, and nurture and guide Graham Linehan, Adam Curtis, Nira Park, John Lloyd, Steven Moffat, Charlie Brooker, Julia Davies, Iain Morris, Simon Cowell, Jon Plowman, Shane Meadows, Aardman Animation, and hundreds more like them, producers and writers, many of whom are not household names, but who have a consistent passion for striking ideas, all part of the collective and exceptional TV talent in the UK.</p> <p>I personally will always be grateful to Roly Keating when as Controller of BBC Four, he listened to my rather back-of-an-envelope description of what a fuzzy, semi-improvised, quickly shot, ensemble political comedy might be like and then gave me \u00a3200,000 and said, 'see what you can make with this,'. We made the first three episodes.</p> <p>And I think also something like the recent Star Gazing Live on BBC2, the astronomy show stretched nightly across a single week, was an example of great, creative commissioning, where time and space, literally, was entrusted to a group of individuals and experts, at a risk it could all fall flat, but given encouragement and profile \u2013 and in the garnering, great viewing figures and rewards.</p> <p>The best commissioners don't work over creative production, but alongside it. They don't stare down at what's on their desks, but look up and see what talent is there in the room and how it can be stretched and challenged and inspired to think about the best way to fill that rectangular screen in the corner. Look at the Olympic opening ceremony. There was the commission, 'let Britain show the rest of the world what it is now,' and it was entrusted to one man, Danny Boyle, to feel free to flesh it out. It was quirky, entertaining, and insightful. It didn't please everyone. My favourites exchange was from the Tory MP Aidan Burley who tweeted it was 'multi-cultural crap' and a reply from @paulsinha who tweeted back, 'if you think the ceremony is multi-cultural, wait till you see the sport,'.</p> <p>But I think we got some sense of the energy and passion that went into that ceremony: it was a clear creative vision, and so it connected. Just imagine what would have happened if that same brief, 'show the world what Britain now is,' was instead given to a committee. If there had been boxes to tick, content to pick off.</p> <p>Well, we don't need to imagine, because we all remember the Millennium Dome Exhibition. When the government, the chief commissioner, decided the thing was too important to be left to mere creatives. So it thought it could determine the content, which was why the section in The Body Zone on creativity was a brain on a stick telling Tommy Cooper jokes.</p> <p>Which mindless image brings me neatly onto the subject of politicians. Another reason British television has felt so disarmed, confused as to what it's for or where it should be going, is because of the consistent, cack-handed, interference from politicians, goaded by the press, and the rather supine and scared way the broadcasting executives have failed to fight back, too scared to face the rebuke of the press headlines.</p> <p>Governments, whether right or left, have become the commissioners in chief, nudging and cajoling the networks into their preferred business models without the slightest sensitivity or awareness of what the British public wants from its television service, or what the British TV industry is capable of.</p> <p>Now, it's all too easy to portray the average politician as a policy-wonk fed since the age of 14 on position papers on social policy and party outreach, professionally married to the job, ascetically weaned day and night on the company of his or her fellow party workers and political researchers, never seeing daylight, never watching telly, never having any cultural development outside whatever serves their policy purview.</p> <p>This would be all too easy a caricature. But it would also be accurate. Because that's what career politicians are like. By career politicians I mean those politicians who have worked the system well enough to gain office. They have no idea what the average member of the public culturally consumes because they are not average members of the public. They are specially bred adminadroids legislabating into an empty chamber and who experience everything through the matrix of their own political blueprint for Britain. Or, put simply, they don't watch much telly.</p> <p>The recent Leveson inquiry has thrown up many things, including the testimony of the late Jeremy Hunt. It's interesting to notice that although people criticise the fact that we now have a transport secretary who's scared of flying and an equalities minister who's against gays, nobody has picked up on the fact that a man a lot of people want to see dead is now health secretary.</p> <p>As we all remember, Jeremy Hunt was a firm supporter of the News Corp takeover of BskyB, writing a letter to the prime minister early in 2010, before he'd been decide to wave it through. In that letter of advice, in November 2010 , Hunt wrote: 'James Murdoch wants to repeat what his father did with the move to Wapping and create the world's first multi-platform media operator available from paper to web to TV to iPhone to iPad. The UK has the chance to lead the way on this as we did in the '80s with the Wapping move. If we block it our media sector will suffer for years'.</p> <p>No reference here to content, nothing about what this will mean for the British viewer, what form of programming it will unlock; what benefits it will bring to our viewing experience; how culturally it will have impact; what opportunities it will present to the creative industry. Nothing. Just a dry analysis of the cash nexus behind a digital strategy.</p> <p>It's a lack of imaginative engagement that, coming from someone who went on to become culture secretary, I find quite chilling. But it's typical I think of how the political class view us. We are there to be badgered if we don't conform to their message, if they feel we haven't represented their side of the story well enough, or we are there to be bullied if we stray from their economic overview of what a broadcasting industry should do. If they feel it's too downmarket; too upmarket; too expensive; not investing enough; too leftwing; too rightwing; too London-centric; spending too much money on outsourcing to the regions; not attracting key talent; spending too much on key talent. I say bullying because I do feel politicians, goaded by newspaper editors, have seen broadcasting, and particularly the BBC, as an easy target.</p> <p>But now is the time to fight back. There's a perfect alignment of the stars in favour of the creative forces behind television in the UK. It won't last, so now's the time to strike. The Leveson inquiry has highlighted public misgivings about how our politicians and the press operate, but also the events of the summer have given us a reminder of what the public actually values about British cultural life.</p> <p>In much the same way there was a pride at the celebration of the NHS in that opening ceremony, I think there's a growing recognition that the BBC, and indeed, the UK's wider commitment across channels to public service broadcasting, has given us the very best television available.</p> <p>The public will now never forgive anyone who meddles with British TV for political advantage or to further their own economic agenda. With a new director general there couldn't be a better time to reset the board, and signal that we're just not going to take that kind of interference any more. That we are proud, we relish our idiosyncrasy in television, that it defines our greatness, and that to diminish it is to sterilise our ambition. The facts now prove it.</p> <p>When ITV regions were sold off to the highest bidder, and we ended up with the likes of Carlton (for whom, incidentally David Cameron did the PR) then ITV suffered the consequences in declining viewers, and reputation. This it's now rebuilding, through a commitment once again, to quality drama and distinctive, idiosyncratic programmes.</p> <p>As Sky realises it's extended as far as it can, the number of subscriptions it can pick up through sport and movies, it's had to commit to finding a whole new type of subscriber, one who's looking for that quality, that high-end production values and scripted ambition that we used to associate with British TV, but which we now recognise in America.</p> <p>And so it's ploughing a fortune into new production, big new dramas and new comedy. It's establishing relationships with theatre companies, and opera groups and book festivals that others can only dream of. We should be willing this venture to succeed. For years we've been arguing that Sky makes all this money and it should use it to fund original content, so I think it's cheap and churlish point scoring to ignore them or want them to fail. But, the challenge now is for Sky to hold its nerve. Some shows won't rate, the money can't last forever. If it really wants to make its mark, it's now got to find the new talent, engage with the young writers, find the next comedians and actors and show it can take risks with them as well. The reward for us will be that there is a genuine hunger and competitive fight among broadcasters for the best new drama and comedy.</p> <p>If we can demonstrate that good programmes actually do mean good business, then we've arrived at a truly creative marketplace where there's a genuine fight for content, a fear that the best might be going elsewhere if you don't snap it up.</p> <p>That dramatically shifts the focus back to us, the programme makers, to come up with more, new, startling ideas, absolutely unmissable storylines and settings, the sharpest writing. The commissioners will have to put more work into establishing relationships with key talent, cajoling, encouraging them to feel confident that once again they've found a home for their work.</p> <p>This is the one profound impression I brought back from my work at HBO. That, actually, its business model is now inextricably bound up in its claims for originality and the close relationships it forms with programme makers. That it makes money from new subscriptions, and it can only increase its subscriptions if more and more people know they're paying to get something different from their usual fare. And that can only happen if HBO keeps coming up with programmes that are more daring, or funnier, or more distinctive than the competition.</p> <p>As a result, it makes a fortune, and can plug that back into production. It doesn't run commercials and actually isn't too bothered by individual ratings. Other networks are now copying them, like FX, Showtime and AMC. This way of making adventurous television is becoming the norm. It's why American TV at the moment is the place most creatives want to go. At HBO, I found a refreshing commitment to me, the programme maker, a culture of backing the creative.</p> <p>But here's the thing, what makes US television so good now, this commitment to us, is not new. For it's precisely what defined British television for decades. Our passion, our drive to make what felt different and adventurous, had been the hallmark of British television for 40 years. I like to think that, if it got lost recently, that was just a blip. That it hasn't been forgotten, and that once again the circumstances are slotting into place whereby it has to re-emerge and stay with us if we're to survive and then go on to re-take our position as the best TV makers in the world.</p> <p>And that blip, that period we've just come through, where programmes were filtered through charts and schedules and executive brain cells and imposed on a creative workforce, that is precisely the old-fashioned mechanics of the big American networks that HBO and company are fighting free of. Just as US TV was excelling by copying the values of British programme makers, so were British channels falling into the worse habits of committee-driven American network TV.</p> <p>I don't know what it's saying, but I wrote this speech on my iPad, which I bought when I was filming in America. So it must be on American settings, because every time I typed in BBC the autocorrect changed it to NBC.</p> <p>I genuinely believe that times are changing, that networks are waking up to the fact that viewers will leave them unless they can commission daring and original shows. That there is now genuine competition among them for the best talent, that the internet and the international viewing audience now mean programme makers can circumvent traditional channels and commissioners if they feel they're making no headway for them.</p> <p>I believe that we may be on the verge of a tantalising moment in television, where the more good programmes we make, the healthier the audiences and the revenue. It will represent a final and fitting twist to those words of James Murdoch. He said that 'the only reliable, durable guarantor of independence is profit.' Could it be that soon the only reliable, durable guarantee of profit is independence? Only we can prove whether that will be the case.</p> <p>It won't happen overnight. It does need investment, we should be more aggressive in selling our content overseas. The BBC should be more aggressive, all of television should, against the politicians and press barons who seek to tame it and rein it in. It's up to all of us to fight, fight to recapture first position with our ideas, but fight forcefully and loudly against all those who criticise what we do. We shouldn't be scared of offending, or portraying a multi-cultural nation, or pouring money into talent, or making shows that split opinion, that occasionally fail.</p> <p>We shouldn't be afraid of abandoning caution and market research, nor afraid to write and produce from the heart, out of passion. After all, what better way is there to connect with someone, than a fight?

  "<p>China was once known as the kingdom of bicycles, but these days the car is the image that best sums up the country's rapid economic development. The streets of Chinese cities which were once chock-a-block with graceful cyclists are now <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2010/aug/25/china-mega-jams-coal\" title=\"\">clogged with snarling traffic jams</a>. But the bike has not been completely relegated to the rubbish bin of China's history.</p> <p>On the drive into the centre of Shanghai from the airport, the long lines of traffic would make it easy to believe that most Shanghainese have abandoned their once beloved home-brand Flying Pigeon and Forever bikes for an Audi or a BMW. However, while a luxury car is undoubtedly the most desired symbol of wealth, the average salary last year in Shanghai was 52,655 RMB (\u00a35,226) leaving even a basic model out of reach for most residents, and millions still use pedal power to get around the city.</p> <p>Prior to moving to Shanghai, I was an avid cyclist and had romantic notions of pedalling shoulder to shoulder with hordes of cycling comrades and humming <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTy3WA0Pq8M\" title=\"\">Katie Melua's Nine Million Bicycles</a>. The reality is a lot more chaotic and certainly not for the faint-hearted.</p> <p>The car is king of the road in Shanghai and cyclists have been relegated to the bottom of the vehicular food chain, second only to pedestrians. While I've been assured traffic rules do exist in Shanghai, the only rule that I've been able to work out is that the bigger you are, the less you have to pay heed to these rules. Red lights are invisible to many bus and car drivers who sail straight through, ignoring the crowds of pedestrians trying to cross the road and honk at cyclists in the bike lanes to get out of their way.</p> <p>There are also motorbikes and electric bikes, called e-bikes, to contend with too. E-bikes, or silent killers as they have been nicknamed by a friend, make virtually no noise so unless you have your wits completely about you and eyes in the back of your head, you don't know when one may be about to crash into you or run you off the road.</p> <p>With its many bike lanes, Shanghai initially looked like a city that was relatively bike-friendly. However, the cars are now the priority of the city's road builders and cyclists are banned from many of the larger and busier roads. But undeterred, many cyclists simply take to the footpaths and hurtle down them paying no heed to pedestrians.</p> <p>I'm not alone in finding cycling in Shanghai daunting. Monica Chen moved to Shanghai three months ago from Changzhou in Jiangsu province and cycled at first but gave it up after two months. \"Cars are not scared of you, they don't care about the traffic lights. Those riding the electronic bikes too. Almost every day I see a traffic accident. It is also difficult to find a place to park a bike because it is easy for it to be stolen,\" she said.</p> <p>While cycling in Europe has become fashionable again, in Shanghai many of those who cycle do so because it is the only form of transport they can afford. The bike and the car are apt symbols of the widening gulf between rich and poor in China's cities. \"It's not that you like cycling, you have to, you have no other choice, you have no other transport,\" says Tony Pan who works as a cook. In Europe he says it might be easier for people to buy cars, but in China, especially in Shanghai \"it is even difficult to buy the licence plate, they are expensive\".</p> <p>Because it had started to rain heavily, Tony invited me into his apartment to continue our bike conversation. He has been cycling since he was a child in Shanghai and he says there are many more cars now \"because there are more and more rich guys here\".</p> <p>\"But the gap between the poor and the rich is still very big. The living environment is too different,\" he says gesturing around his tiny, cramped apartment with not enough room to stand up in.</p> <p>Despite the crazy traffic, the apparent lack of safety concerns and the eye-stinging pollution, I'm glad I took to the roads on two wheels rather than four. Nothing beats cycling for soaking up the atmosphere and the delicious smells from roadside dumpling vendors. And after a few weeks of getting used to the traffic, I discovered that the chaos is a functioning chaos.</p> <p>Just a few days ago I almost fulfilled my romantic notion of cycling in Shanghai as I trundled along a narrow tree-lined street in the former French concession. I smiled at my fellow cyclists, had the time to notice a little noodle shop I want to try and caught laughter coming from group of old men in pyjamas playing a streetside game of majong. And all of a sudden my reverie was broken by a loud beep as a car narrowly missed hitting my back tyre.</p> <p>\u2022 Jennifer Duggan is a freelance journalist based in Shanghai, who also contributes to the Irish Times, BBC World Service, and Irish Independent</p>",
  "<p>The UK has four of the top six universities in the latest edition of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/table/2012/sep/11/top-200-qs-world-university-rankings-2012\" title=\"\">QS World University Rankings</a>, but the <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/massachusetts-institute-technology-mit\" title=\"\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</a> has taken over from Cambridge in first place.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/university-cambridge\" title=\"\">Cambridge</a> has dropped to second place after two years heading the rankings, but remains ahead of <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/harvard-university\" title=\"\">Harvard</a>, the only other university to have led the table in its nine years of publication. The other UK universities in the top six are <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/ucl-university-college-london\" title=\"\">University College London</a>, <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/university-oxford\" title=\"\">Oxford</a> and <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/imperial-college-london\" title=\"\">Imperial College London</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest revelation in the rankings, however, concerns the increasingly international character of the leading universities. Despite consistent growth in the number of international students over the past decade, the new rankings show the top 100 universities raising recruitment by almost 10% in a single year.</p> <p>The figures suggest that students looking for an overseas education are becoming more choosy about where they go. And they confirm growing competition for international students \u2013 and reliance on their fees - in leading universities all over the world, not just in the traditional host countries.</p> <p>Even some universities in the top 100, like Cambridge, that have registered modest increases in overseas student numbers, have been overtaken on this measure. The top 500 universities in the QS rankings have added no fewer than 120,000 international students in the latest edition.</p> <p>The figures demonstrate why universities of all types were so concerned at the UK government's tightening of visa regulations, culminating in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/30/lmu-student-recruitment-teaching-learning\" title=\"\">the suspension of London Metropolitan University's licence to sponsor students from outside the EU</a>. University College London, which has overtaken Oxford to move into fourth place, has almost 10,000 international students.</p> <p>It is growth in international faculty that accounts for MIT's move to the top of the rankings for the first time, however. The university has overtaken both Cambridge and neighbouring Harvard to take first place, having led 11 of the 29 subject rankings published by QS in June.</p> <p>MIT is one of a number of universities specialising in science and technology to improve their positions this year. Nine of the top ten technological universities have moved further up the rankings, with the <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/kaist-korea-advanced-institute-science-technology\" title=\"\">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</a> enjoying the biggest rise in the top 100.</p> <p>Scores in the QS rankings comprise an equal balance of expert opinion and data on staffing levels, research citations and international students and faculty. More than 46,000 academics and 25,000 employers have contributed their views in the most extensive polling ever undertaken on global universities.</p> <p>American universities dominate the QS rankings, as they have every year since they were first published in 2004. US institutions occupy six of the top ten places, 13 of the top 20 and 31 of the top 100 \u2013 the same numbers as last year.</p> <p>Harvard, in third place, remains the favourite of both academics and employers. It also tops four of the five broad faculty rankings <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com\" title=\"\">published with the institutional ranking</a>.</p> <p>The UK is again the next most successful country, although it has lost one university from the top 20, one from the top 100 and one from the top 200. Its four universities in the top ten and 18 in the top 100 show a system continuing to punch well above its weight.</p> <p>The strong performance of UK universities will surprise some observers but, with research funding protected in cash terms and revenue from international students rising, the leading institutions have not experienced the level of cuts suffered by some of their competitors. Even the wealthy US Ivy League institutions have reined back spending as they tried to repair the damage done to their endowments during the recession.</p> <p>Academics and employers continue to rate UK universities highly and the leading institutions have begun to make significant progress on the key measure of research quality \u2013 the number of citations per academic. All but three of the top 20 UK universities achieved higher citation rates than last year, although they still have ground to make up on their American counterparts.</p> <p>The results will give little encouragement to those predicting a wave of UK student emigration to the universities of Continental Europe, where fees are much lower than in England. The nine leading French universities have all dropped down the ranking, while there are no German or Dutch universities in the top 50. <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/eth-zurich-swiss-federal-institute-technology\" title=\"\">ETH Zurich</a> is by far the highest-placed Continental university, at 13th.</p> <p>Canada has two universities in the top 20 for the first time, with <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/university-toronto\" title=\"\">Toronto</a> joining Montreal's <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/mcgill-university\" title=\"\">McGill University</a> among the elite. But Australia again has more universities in the top 100 than any country outside the US and UK.</p> <p>Asian universities continue to make progress up the rankings and to attract more international students, rather than simply being the favoured recruiting ground of Western institutions. <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/university-hong-kong\" title=\"\">Hong Kong University</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/national-university-singapore-nus\" title=\"\">National University of Singapore</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/university-tokyo\" title=\"\">University of Tokyo</a> all appear in the top 30.</p> <p>A record 72 countries are represented among the 700 universities that will feature in the full ranking. The six leading universities in the Middle East have all improved their positions and there has been a big increase in the number of Latin American universities ranked globally.</p> <p>Overall, the institutional ranking is more stable than it has ever been. There is only one new entrant to the top 20 and the average movement in the top 100 is 4.6 places, while in the top 200 the average is 9.1.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Can London handle another 300-cover steak restaurant? The Danish restaurant group <a href=\"http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Business/From-Copenhagen-to-Soho-London-set-to-host-largest-MASH-steak-restaurant-and-first-outside-Denmark?nocount\">Copenhagen Concepts</a> - which will open a branch of its steakhouse <a href=\"http://www.mashsteak.dk/\">MASH</a> in Soho this November - clearly thinks so. The company is convinced that the capital's current bloodlust, its almost insatiable desire for steak, is no flash in the grill pan.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.timhayward.com/home.html\">Tim Hayward</a> seems to agree. Writing in <a href=\"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/content/magazine/olive/\">Olive Magazine</a> recently, he identified the Steakationers (a group of moneyed, macho suits who, when they aren't studying <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780340826355\">Meat</a>, frequent Square Mile steak restaurants), as one of Britain's most significant new \"food tribes\". Not that it's solely City slickers who fill the tables at <a href=\"http://thehawksmoor.com/food/introduction\">Hawskmoor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/08/goodman-restaurant-london\">Goodman</a>. </p> <p>Nor is the phenomenon confined to London. In Belfast, you can eat steaks from the obligatory charcoal-fired <a href=\"http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/a201007271.html\">Josper</a> at <a href=\"http://www.belfastbargrill.co.uk/\">James Street South Bar &amp; Grill</a>. In Manchester, you could visit Malmaison's <a href=\"http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/07/12/2011/341502/Menuwatch-Smoak-bar-and-grill.htm\">Smoak</a>. Variations on the theme are also emerging, such as <a href=\"http://www.cattlegridrestaurant.com/\">Cattle Grid</a> (budget), <a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/lifestyle/restaurants/905423-the-bull-steak-expert-serves-some-of-the-finest-steak-in-london\">Bull Steak Expert</a> (Argentinian) and <a href=\"http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/09/06/2011/338669/Team-behind-Gaucho-launches-more-casual-high-street-restaurant.htm\">Cau</a> (budget and Argentinian). MASH, patronisingly, claims that one of its USPs is its female-friendly decor.</p> <p>This rebirth of steak as a popular gourmet product is one of the most remarkable episodes in recent restaurant history. Five years ago, foodists did not get excited about steak: the only people who ordered it were people who didn't really like food. It was a boring menu staple for risk-averse diners. It was what your dad liked, well-done, and preferably topped with a little rosette of garlic butter, as he had first eaten it at a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berni_Inn\">Berni Inn</a> decades ago.</p> <p><a href=\"http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/427906\">Beef</a> has also taken a pounding <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/08/food.unitednations\">in the media</a>. Beef, particularly that from <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/03/29/grass.grain.beef.cookinglight/index.html\">intensively-reared, grain-fed animals</a> is now <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7961240.stm\">considered</a> to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/nov/05/cereal-crop-farming-wheat-prices\">one of</a> the <a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/innovativefarming/policyresearch/sustainableanimalfeed\">least sustainable foods</a> that you <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/what-we-do/news/view-page/item842690/\">can eat</a>. It doesn't come cheap, either. At <a href=\"http://thehawksmoor.com/\">Hawksmoor</a>, where they use grass-fed British beef, a 10\u00bd oz (300g) steak with chips and a side starts at \u00a323. Head over to Mayfair, to <a href=\"http://www.45parklane.com/CUTat45ParkLane\">Cut</a> and a 10oz, 35 day aged New York sirloin will set you back <a href=\"http://www.45parklane.com/uploads/documents/Dinner.pdf\">\u00a338</a> (pdf), before fries or onion rings (crazily, \u00a37 each).</p> <p>Yet, even in the midst of this grisly recession, steak is back, back, back. Why? The quality has improved enormously: steak got a reputation for being bland and conservative at a time when, generally, we were being served rubbish steak. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2004/sep/05/foodanddrink.shopping1\">In these pages</a> just eight years ago Jay Rayner described a good steak as an, \"appallingly rare joy\", and sure, you can still eat <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2012/feb/17/hotel-review-indigo-liverpool\">bad steak</a>. But, more tellingly, I have recently eaten <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2011/dec/16/raithwaite-hall-yorkshire-hotel-review\">sensational steak</a> in the midst of otherwise mediocre meals.</p> <p>Even at home, armed with a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tastemakers/how-to-cook-the-perfect-steak\">solid-fuel grill</a> or a blisteringly hot ridged <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/15/how-to-cook-perfect-steak\">grill pan</a> any reasonably competent cook can produce great steaks. As Hawksmoor's Huw Gott <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/oct/18/live-chat-steak-masterclass\">told us last year</a>, buy properly aged, British, rare-breed beef, and most of the work has already been done for you. </p> <p>These days, from the silky, sinewy, highly-flavoursome <a href=\"http://bbq.about.com/od/steaks/a/aa112704a.htm\">flat steaks</a> (a flash-fried hanger or a piece of frilly, soy-marinated skirt), to a bone-in sirloin, edged with perfectly seared fat, steak offers all sorts of variety in different <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/may/19/perfect-steak-sirloin-rump-fillet\">cuts</a>, breeds, even mouthful by mouthful from one end of a steak to the other. Be it sweet, grassy, richly buttery, invigoratingly bloody, highly mineral, livery and gamy, tinged with a ripe and cheesy or long-hung farmyardy tang, steaks offer a full spectrum of interesting flavours. All of that wrapped up in one of life's primary savoury pleasure: a densely-charred exterior.</p> <p>Plus, this might be our last chance. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/aug/26/food-shortages-world-vegetarianism\">Fast forward 30 years</a> and - even if we haven't all <a href=\"http://viva.org.uk/\">embraced vegetarianism</a> - beef will probably be prohibitively expensive. The only people still eating it will be Cut's super-wealthy regulars.</p>",
  "<p>Olympic fever gripped the nation to such an extent that no one was betting on any other sports in August, according to online gambling exchange <strong>Betfair</strong>.</p> <p>So after a first quarter boosted by Euro 2012 - with revenues of \u00a37.8m from the tournament helping total sales climb 13% - the company's performance since the end of July has faltered. Second quarter gaming revenues so far have fallen 2%, it said. Finance director Stephen Morana said:</p> <blockquote> A slower start to the football season and reduced interest in other sports during the Olympics resulted in slower revenue growth in August. After a strong first quarter, this leaves year to date revenues in line with our expectations. <br> </blockquote> <p>The company's new chief executive Breon Corcoran joined at the start of August, but he faces a number of challengers. No sooner has he started than Betfair needs to find a new finance director, with Morana announcing his intention to step down once a successor is found.</p> <p>On the trading front, as well as the Olympic effect, the company has seen restrictions on the products it can offer in Spain and Cyprus, while new taxes have been introduced in Germany.</p> <p>After the update, Betfair's shares have dropped 18.5p to 729.5p. James Hollins at Investec repeated his sell recommendation, saying:</p> <blockquote> The shift from a technology-led (David Yu, ex-chief technology officer) to an operations-led chief executive (Breon Corcoran, ex-chief operating officer at Paddy Power) should drive superior levels of cost control and a closer match of ongoing expenses to the reality of Betfair's existing and potential global sports betting footprint. <br> Our aggressively bearish stance has been tempered by the senior management change and the emergence of some clarity on regulation (eg Italy and Spain). However, (1) ongoing legislative/tax risk (eg Germany, Greece and UK), (2) below sector average free cash flow generation, (3) sector premium multiples (25 times 2013 PE versus our gaming sector peers average at 14 times), and (4) a new discounted cash flow-based price target of 625p result in a maintained sell recommendation. </blockquote>",
  "<p><strong>Burberry</strong> has seemed to defy gravity for so long that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/11/burberry-warns-profits-sales-luxury-fashion\" title=\"\">an unexpected warning on profits</a> was bound to send it crashing to earth.</p> <p>The luxury goods group's shares have dropped 248p to \u00a311.27, an 18% decline which makes them by far the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. There had been a nagging concern that the sector could not buck the global downturn forever, and signs of a slowdown in key market China have added to these worries.</p> <p>In the event Burberry said like for like sales in the second quarter were unchanged year on year, with signs of a slowdown in recent weeks. It said it was taking action to manage costs and protect short term profitability. Analysts said it had frozen headcount and travel expenditure, cut marketing spend and deferred IT projects.</p> <p>The news has sent shockwaves throughout the European luxury sector, with <strong>LVMH</strong> down 4.2%, Cucci owner <strong>PPR </strong>4.1% lower and <strong>Richemont</strong>, the maker of Cartier jewellery, down 5%. Back in the UK handbag maker <strong>Mulberry</strong> is off 68p at \u00a312.90, a 5% decline.</p> <p>Analyst Kate Calvert at Seymour Pierce cut her recommendation, saying:</p> <blockquote> The trend Burberry is talking about may seem at odds with the rest of the sector news of late but we note that this is current news up until 8 September and would not be surprised if other luxury players are seeing similar trends. The recent de-rating of the shares has already started to anticipate a slowdown and this slowdown is nothing like the brick wall the sector impacted in 2008 when the financial crisis hit. Indeed, Burberry is in a much stronger position brand and infrastructure wise to react to a slowdown given recent system investment so is unlikely to have the same stock issues. <br> This news will obviously hit sentiment towards Burberry and the luxury sector and the shares are likely to underperform until there is better news on demand so we are cutting our recommendation to hold [from buy]. </blockquote> <p>Bethany Hocking at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> We understand market forecasts are for \u00a3407m-\u00a3455m. We had expected \u00a3440.6m, so for us this represents a downgrade of around 8%. <br> We have been fans of Burberry, and remain of the view that the strategy, luxury positioning and management team should lead to long-term sector outperformance. Today's statement does, however, imply a significant slowdown and Burberry is not immune from wider macro-economic turbulence. We place our forecasts, target price and recommendation under review. </blockquote> <p>Burberry's slump knocked 4 points off an already downbeat <strong>FTSE 100</strong>. The leading index is 20.11 points lower at 5773.09 ahead of the anticipated German court ruling on the European fiscal pact and bailout fund, due tomorrow, and the US Federal Reserve meeting on Thursday.</p> <p>With copper prices easing, investors took some profits from the recent rise in the mining sector. <strong>Anglo American</strong> is down 82p to 1919.5p, while <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> has fallen 49.5p to 953.5p after India's Goa state said it was temporarily suspending iron ore mining to check if operations there were legal. So Vedanta subsidiary Sesa Goa has stopped ore extraction, and will submit all relevant documents as soon as possible.</p>",
  "<p>With just hours to go before the Man Booker prize shortlist is unveiled this morning, Hilary Mantel's follow-up to Wolf Hall is the bookies' favourite to take a place amongst the final six novels.</p> <p>Mantel's Bring Up the Bodies, her continuation of the adventures of Henry VIII's scheming adviser Thomas Cromwell, is currently at 3/1 to win the Booker at William Hill, and 9/4 at Ladbrokes. Will Self, the other major name on an eclectic longlist which included four debut novelists, is second favourite for his stream-of-consciousness novel Umbrella at both bookmakers, given odds of winning the prize of 10/3 at William Hill and 11/4 at Ladbrokes.</p> <p>\"All of the momentum is with Mantel and punters are confident in her bid for the first ever repeat win. Wolf Hall was one of the best backed winners of all time and the odds suggest we're facing a repeat of 2009. However there's also a significant amount of interest in the high profile name on the list, Will Self,\" said Jessica Bridge at Ladbrokes.</p> <p>Graham Sharpe at William Hill agreed that Wolf Hall had been the heaviest backed Booker winner ever, but said that \"the hefty bets which poured in for Wolf Hall have not yet been replicated \u2013 maybe people think that being such a recent winner could work against her\". If Self was to take the Booker for the first time, it \"would be an expensive result\", admitted Sharpe, \"with many literary punters believing he is overdue the accolade of being a winner of this prize\".</p> <p>The Booker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/jul/27/booker-prize-bias-english\">was attacked by the Scottish authors Alan Bissett</a> and Irvine Welsh this year for being, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/19/irvine-welsh-edinburgh-books-festival\">in Welsh's words</a>, \"based on the conceit that upper-class Englishness is the cultural yardstick against which all literature must be measured\". Its winners, according to Welsh, have alternated \"between largely upper-middle-class English writers and citizens of the former colonies, presumably to stamp legitimacy on this 'global accolade'\".</p> <p>Ladbrokes believes the shortlist will be completed by two novelists from British authors \u2013 Alison Moore's debut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/24/the-lighthouse-alison-moore-review?INTCMP=SRCH\">The Lighthouse</a> and Deborah Levy's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781908276025/swimming-home\">Swimming Home</a> \u2013 along with the Malaysian author Tan Twan Eng's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/24/garden-evening-mists-tan-twan-eng-review\">The Garden of Evening Mists</a> and the Indian author Jeet Thayil's<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571275762/narcopolis\"> Narcopolis</a>. William Hill is also throwing Rachel Joyce's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780857520647/unlikely-pilgrimage-of-harold-fry\">The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry</a>, Nicola Barker's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780007476657/the-yips\">The Yips</a> and Michael Frayn's Skios into the mix.</p> <p>\"Personally, I really enjoyed Harold Fry and I think The Lighthouse shouldn't be under-estimated, but I expect the shrewd money to talk, and it is telling me Will Self will win this time round,\" said Sharpe.</p> <p>Whether this year's Booker judges will follow the money \u2013 or take note of Welsh and Bissett's criticisms \u2013 when they announce their shortlist at 11am this morning remains to be seen. Chair of judges Peter Stothard, editor of the Times Literary Supplement, has said that the panel is looking for novels which can take a second reading. \"A text has to reveal more, the more often you read it,\" he said on announcing the longlist. \"We were looking for books that you can make a sustained critical argument about, and when you read them again, you can make a different critical argument \u2013 not for books you can just say 'wow, I enjoyed it', or 'wow, that was terrible'.\"</p>",

The Olympics and Paralympics were wonderful not just because of the Team GB medal haul, but because \u2013 after decades of agonising over our national identity \u2013 they brought it into focus. We saw the forces of openness and tolerance reclaim the Union Jack. We showcased ourselves not as big and imperial and imposing, a nation constantly harking back to some bygone age.

These hearings are supposed to perform an investigatory function, allowing MPs to find out what happened and why, but this morning Glenys Stacey, the Ofqual chief regulator, splatted the committee with gobbledygook. I certainly found it hard to follow what she was saying and, although it's quite possible that I was being dim, I did get the impression that members of the committee did not have a forensic understanding of what she was saying either.&#xa0;</p> <p>But it was not entirely hopeless. You always learn something during these hearings and today was no exception. Here are the main points.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has admitted that it contacted two exam boards, Edexcel and WJEC, because it thought their English results were too high.</strong> Stacey said there was a particular problem with Edexcel.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Edexcel - the preliminary results were high. If the provisional results had been left to stand I think we were looking at 6% or 7% inflation and I suspect there would have been a different outcry had that been the outcome. They were certainly out of line with the other awarding body results.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said that Edexcel accepted Ofqual's demand for it to raise its grade boundaries. If Edexcel had refused, Ofqual could have forced it to comply she said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has said that it was surprised that schools had such high expectations for their GCSE English results this year.</strong> The point was made by Amanda Spielman, the Ofqual chair.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You might have thought that this year, in the first year of a completely different exam, schools would be a bit more cautious about their predictions and have brought them down a bit. I\u2019m not saying it is the schools\u2019 fault, I\u2019m saying school expectations were in a very different place. We would have expected in the face of a new specification to see schools being more cautious and what we actually saw was that school expectations for Cs went up by 2%.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has said that further education colleges were hit particularly hard by the decision to toughen grade boundaries in GCSE English.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual's chair has said that t<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/gcses-will-be-regraded-for-pupils-in-wales--but-ofqual-refuses-to-reassess-the-grades-in-england-8122408.html\">he Welsh government decided to regrade its English papers</a> for political reasons.</strong> It was embarrassing for them to accept poor results, Spielman said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has said that it is wiling to release details of all its correspondence and calls with the Department for Education, including Michael Gove and his advisers.</strong> There was no political interference in its decision to toughen grade boundaries, Stacey said.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:46:34.334Z\">at 12.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-504f1bd858f94f441baa7a3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:09:14.076Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Times Educational Supplement has now published in full<a href=\"http://www.tes.co.uk/tesassets/images/resources/Ofqual_Edexcel_Documents_2012.pdf\"> the leaked letters (pdf)</a> that formed the basis of <a href=\"http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6289695\">its story saying Ofqual ordered Edexcel to raise its grade boundaries.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-504f1addc0e312b4deaa4803\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:05:02.140Z\">12.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ofqual submitted written evidence to the education committee before this morning's hearing. I have not seen it yet, but the Press Association has filed a story based on what it says.

And for some schools the results are a far cry from their expectations.\" <br>The report says it is important to note that \"there has been no political interference\". <br>And it insists that the regulator played its \"proper role, regulating standards\". <br>\"Awarding in January and before was generous, but neither exam boards nor the regulators could have seen it at the time. <br>\"All the evidence at the time was that awarding decisions were if anything harsh.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-504f19d7c0e312b4deaa4802\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:00:41.034Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The hearing is over.

  "<p>Hay fever sufferers face longer pollen seasons and highly allergenic new strains from invasive plants, a new report on the health effects of climate change on the UK warned on Tuesday.</p> <p>Global warming will cause earlier flowering, possibly extending the hay fever season by six weeks, and enable new species to grow in the UK. Pollen is also getting more potent, packing more allergen into each grain.</p> <p>The report, from the <a href=\"http://www.hpa.org.uk/HPAwebHome/\" title=\"\">Health Protection Agency</a> (HPA), analyses a wide range of risks including killer heatwaves, increased flooding, greater food poisoning and new infectious diseases carried by mosquitoes.</p> <p>\"There is no doubt that climate change poses a wide range of challenges to public health in the UK,\" said David Heymann, chairman of the HPA.</p> <p>But the report also predicts a significant decrease in the number of deaths caused by cold winter weather. Furthermore, action to cut the carbon emissions driving climate change could have beneficial health effects, the report notes, by cutting the air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels, reducing meat consumption through <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/13/less-meat-prevent-climate-change\" title=\"\">low-carbon vegetarian diets</a> and increasing the exercise people take by encouraging cycling and walking over driving.</p> <p>One in five people currently suffers from hay fever, which is linked to potentially life-threatening asthma. An increase in streaming eyes, running nose and itching skin is a serious issue, said Roy Kennedy, professor of aerobiology and microbial science at the University of Worcester, who contributed to the HPA report. \"It is not trivial,\" he said, adding in the report: \"Hay fever and asthma significantly reduce quality of life and have a significant economic impact on society.\"</p> <p>Kennedy said the potency of the main pollen sources \u2013 grass and birch trees \u2013 is increasing, while warmer temperatures could cause pollen grains to burst more often, making the allergens they contain more available. Alien species could increase misery for existing sufferers or create new sufferers; Prof Kennedy noted the example of ragweed from America that is now established in Italy and produces highly allergenic pollen.</p> <p>The most direct effect of climate change on health is through increased heat and the report concludes that annual deaths from heat will increase sixfold by the 2080s, to 12,000 a year on average. Deaths from winter cold will fall by about 40%, the report states, to about 35,000.</p> <p>The HPA report also examined diseases spread by insects. It warned that exotic mosquitoes, which could spread dengue fever and chikungunya fever, are becoming established in mainland Europe and that the chances of the insects becoming established in the UK is increasing as the climate warms. The report also concludes that malaria transmission is projected to be possible across almost all of England by 2050, particularly in the east where the disease occurred in the 19th century. But the authors note that modern living standards will reduce the threat to humans of the disease.</p> <p>Some issues addressed by the report, such the impact of greater ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, are complex, according to the HPA's Jill Meara. There is likely to be a modest increase in UV radiation in the UK, increasing the risk of skin cancer, but reliably warmer weather might mean people spend more holidays in the UK, rather than in the more intense sun of the Mediterranean, thereby cutting their risk of melanoma. The report also notes: \"Gradually increasing solar UV radiation exposure will result in hyperplasia, or [skin] thickening as an adaptive mechanism.\"</p> <p>In addition, sunshine can also have direct benefits, in producing vitamin D, and indirectly in encouraging outdoor activity that can improve physical and mental health.</p> <p>Mental health effects were also highlighted in relation to the projected increase in flooding in the UK. \"Very few people die from being swept away during floods,\" Meara said. \"But there is a long tail of mental health problems for people who have lost their homes and all of their possessions.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/14/flood-defence-schemes-unbuilt?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">government has cut spending on flood defences</a> despite widespread agreement that flood risk is increasing.</p>",
  "<p>Poverty and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) \u2014 the four main ones being cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and diabetes \u2014 feed off each other in a vicious cycle. NCDs and their risk factors worsen poverty, while poverty contributes to rising rates of NCDs, posing a threat to sustainable development.</p> <p>Global trends in population, consumption, migration and urbanisation accelerate the NCD pandemic. Recent decades have seen the rise of \"megacities\", with 10 million or more inhabitants, and it is estimated that 7 billion people, equivalent to the population of the world today, will be living in cities by 2050.</p> <p>These megacities \u2014 with all the traffic, overcrowding and unsanitary conditions that accompany them \u2014 are the perfect <a href=\"http://www.worldheart.org/urbanization\" title=\"\">breeding ground for NCDs</a>. Limited access to healthy food, opportunities for physical activity and poor air quality increase the risks of cancer, chronic respiratory disease, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. As more people are drawn to urban areas, NCDs will only get worse.</p> <p>In 2000, world leaders drafting the millennium development goals (MDGs) addressed many of the great development challenges, but they made one serious mistake: they omitted any mention of NCDs, which together cause nearly two out of three deaths in the world (80% of those in developing countries).</p> <p>As the CEOs of the leading advocacy organisations fighting two of those NCDs, we believe this omission has resulted in a <a href=\"http://ncdalliance.org/sites/default/files/rfiles/The%20MDGs%20and%20NCDs_0.pdf\" title=\"\">double whammy to NCDs \u2013 no attention, no funding</a> \u2013 despite the fact that NCDs are overwhelmingly a poverty issue and related to all eight MDGs.</p> <p>\"What gets measured, gets done,\" says World Health Organisation director general Margaret Chan. But NCDs are not getting measured and therefore not \"getting done\".</p> <p>Human health contributes to, benefits from and measures our progress towards a sustainable future, and it is intuitive that sustainable development cannot be achieved without focusing on health. However, since NCDs account for so many global deaths, it is equally true that health cannot be achieved without focusing on NCDs.</p> <p>Fortunately, the world now has a golden opportunity to correct the 2000 oversight. With the MDGs due to expire in 2015, there is much discussion about a set of post-2015 \"sustainable development goals (SDGs)\". What should the SDGs look like? Increasingly, there is acceptance that they must include NCDs.</p> <p>Over the past two years, we have seen a breakthrough in political recognition of these diseases.</p> <p>The 2011 UN high-level meeting on NCDs unanimously passed a <a href=\"http://www.ncdalliance.org/sites/default/files/rfiles/UN%20HLM%20Political%20Declaration%20English.pdf\" title=\"\">political declaration </a>calling NCDs \"one of the major challenges for development in the 21st century\", and describing \"a vicious cycle whereby NCDs and their risk factors worsen poverty, while poverty contributes to rising rates of NCDs, posing a threat to public health and economic and social development\".</p> <p>In June 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.uncsd2012.org/futurewewant.html\" title=\"\">outcome document </a>of the Rio+20 conference on sustainable development acknowledged that \"the global burden and threat of NCDs constitutes one of the major challenges for sustainable development in the 21st century\".</p> <p>In its <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/Post_2015_UNTTreport.pdf\" title=\"\">June 2012 report</a>, the UN task team on the post-2015 development agenda recognised that the MDGs did not adequately address the increase in NCDs and identified them as a \"priority for social development and investments in people\".</p> <p>At last, the threat of NCDs to sustainable development has received significant political acknowledgement. But what's next? We need NCDs, and appropriate measurable targets, to be included in the next iteration of the MDGs. At the World Health Assembly in May, governments took the bold step of committing themselves to reducing preventable deaths from NCDs by 25% by 2025. That is a promising start, but more is needed.</p> <p>If we do nothing, all the progress we have made towards the MDGs will be wiped out: we will educate children, give them safe water and protect them from Aids and malaria, only to see them die from NCDs. Sustainable development will not happen unless we address NCDs. They need to be part of the post-2015 sustainability development goals. Only then can we build the future we want \u2013 a healthy future for people and the planet.</p>",

Fewer still are likely to realise that this is one of the rarest fungi in the world, a distinction that gives the blister a place on an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/11/100-most-endangered-species-planet\">unenviable list: the world's 100 most threatened species</a>.</p> <p>Equally unlikely to be noticed is the spoon-billed sandpiper, a small, dull-coloured bird that breeds in Russia and migrates to south-east Asia, targeted by hunters on the way.</p> <p>The pygmy three-toed sloth, no bigger than a newborn baby when fully grown, is found only on a single island, off the coast of Panama. The woolly spider monkey, from the Atlantic forest of Brazil, is under threat from the increasing fragmentation of its last remaining habitats.</p> <p>The list, published on Tuesday at the World Conservation Congress in South Korea, the quadrennial meeting of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), was compiled by 8,000 scientists, and is the first of its kind.</p> <p>The only obvious common characteristic of the animals on it is that all are clinging precariously to existence as a result of human actions such as destroying habitats, polluting, hunting and changing the climate. But the scientists who compiled the list had another criterion: they have highlighted species they fear will be allowed to die out without a murmur because they have no obvious benefits for human beings.</p> <p>The list is presented as a challenge, with the title: \"Priceless or worthless?\" Its compilers ask whether we care only for species that are iconic and \"charismatic\", such as tigers and pandas and those, such as the appetite-suppressing hoodia cactus of the Kalahari, that may yield benefits for medicine or other purposes. Or should we decide, they wonder, that even the apparently less-favoured species we are wiping out deserve to be preserved.</p> <p>For Jonathan Baillie, director of conservation at the Zoological Society of London, which compiled the list along with the International Union for Conservation of Nature, this dilemma reflects serious problems with the way conservation is funded today.</p> <p>He said: \"The donor community and conservation movement are increasingly leaning towards a 'what can nature do for us?' approach, where species and wild habitats are valued and prioritised according to these services they provided for people. This has made it increasingly difficult for conservationists to protect the most threatened species on the planet.\"</p> <p>In order to justify spending money on conservation efforts, scientists have felt under increasing pressure to argue for the human benefits that would accrue \u2013 for instance, calling for forests to be preserved because they can prevent landslides and naturally purify water for human consumption rather than because forests should be maintained for their own sake.</p> <p>In some cases, the potential for \"useful\" purposes for some species is contributing to their destruction. The wild yam of South Africa is supposed to have cancer-alleviating properties, according to traditional medicine, but the resulting hunt for the plant is threatening its very existence.</p> <p>In others, the commercialisation of nature is having a damaging effect \u2013 the Franklin's bumble bee, found in California and Oregon, is under threat because of diseases spread by commercially bred bumblebees. Attenborough's Pitcher Plant, named after the famous naturalist Sir David, lives only on Mount Victoria, in the Philippines, but is under threat from collectors because of its fame.</p> <p>Prof Baillie presents a stark choice: \"We have an important moral and ethical decision to make: do these species have a right to survive or do we have a right to drive them to extinction?\"</p> <p>Some of the creatures on the list are down to the last few individuals. For example, numbers of the saola \u2013 an antelope known as the Asian unicorn, so rarely is it sighted \u2013 have been whittled down to the last few tens in existence.</p> <p>Ellen Butcher, of the Zoological Society of London, explained: \"All of the species listed are unique and irreplaceable. If they vanish, no amount of money can bring them back. If we take immediate action we can give them a fighting chance for survival. But this requires society to support the moral and ethical position that all species have an inherent right to exist.\"</p> <p>It is possible that some future medical application may be found for the willow blister fungus, or other plants or even animals on the list. But the conservationists involved stressed that this should not be the decider on whether we make efforts to halt the decline of species that we are destroying.</p> <p>\"All species have a value to nature and thus, in turn to us humans,\" said Simon Stuart, chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission. \"Although the value of some species may not appear obvious at first, all species in fact contribute in their way to the healthy functioning of the planet.\"</p>"
