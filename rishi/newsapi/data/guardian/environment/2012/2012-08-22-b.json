  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.thedetail.tv\">Detail</a> has been given rare access to information stored on the Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) Firearms database in response to a Freedom of Information request.</p> <p>We have analysed detailed information provided on each of the 59,585 people living in Northern Ireland who currently hold firearms licences. In each case, we were given each gun owner's age, gender, the police district they live in, the number of weapons they own and the conditions of use on their licence.</p> <p>We found that almost 60,000 members of the public own over 146,000 firearms with the remaining 7,018 legally-held guns belonging to serving police and prison officers.</p> <p>The data provided relates to the content of the PSNI's firearms database as of March 1st, 2012. Individual owner details were not provided for the serving police and prison officers.</p> <p>We carried out our analysis as the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland is consulting on proposed changes to firearms licensing laws including increasing the cost of applying for a licence and reducing the legal age of gun ownership to 12. </p> <p>The lower age limit is now 16 and it currently costs the PSNI more to run the licensing scheme than they recover in fees.</p> <p>Our analysis of the detailed data provided by the PSNI includes the following key findings:<br></p> <ul> <li>Of the 59,585 licence holders we have detailed information on, 98% are male.</li> <li>The average age of Northern Ireland's gun owners is 53. The youngest is 17 and the oldest 103.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395091821\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345650430578/Gun-Graphic-age-001.jpg\" alt=\"Gun Graphic age\" width=\"460\" height=\"448\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gun Graphic age Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <li>A total of 2,924 licenses have 'Personal Protection Weapon' among the conditions of use.

These records did not have a local police station assigned to them on the PSNI's database.</p> <p>The issue of legally-held firearms recently hit the media headlines after Northern Ireland's Health Minister Edwin Poots fired two shots into the air from his legally held shotgun to warn off intruders at his home.</p> <p>The PSNI said it was investigating the incident after Mr Poots fired from an upstairs bedroom at his house near Lisburn in Co Antrim in June.</p> <p>Here's the list of district codes and details that will help you make sense of the <a href=\"#data\">data on gun ownership</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395091822\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345719522396/Districts-gun-graphic-001.jpg\" alt=\"Districts gun graphic\" width=\"460\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Districts gun graphic Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Please take a look at the data and tell us what you think of it and arms control in Northern Ireland in the comments.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"data\">Download the data</a></h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoEZjwuqFS2PdDRWMEt2b29obTJTc3hNWDNXRGlTbFE\">DATA: download the full spreadsheet</a></p> <h2>More data</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p> <h2>World government data</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world-government-data\">Search the world's government data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Development and aid data</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's global development data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a><br>\u2022 Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@guardian.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">Follow us on Twitter</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">Like us on Facebook</a></strong></p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong>Ministers are considering a new wave of publicly funded housebuilding to kick-start the ailing construction industry and ease the shortage of homes.</p> <p>The housing minister, Grant Shapps, indicated his support for recommendations in a new government-commissioned report into the housing shortage which also proposes relaxing planning regulations that require developers to include social housing and allowing private investors to build on public land at no initial cost. The moves are designed to encourage a new round of construction, with taxpayers reaping the benefits when the homes are sold.</p> <p>The report, commissioned by the government from the chairman of the 3i investment group, Sir Adrian Montague, and published on Thursday, will be taken even more seriously because of the urgent need for a boost to the economy to create jobs and confidence in the private sector.</p> <p>Montague estimates that housing demand is increasing each year at double the rate at which homes are being built. \"Sir Adrian Montague's findings offer both a blueprint for achieving this goal [more housebuilding], and for setting the standards of accommodation that people should expect,\" said Shapps. \"I will be considering his recommendations very carefully.\"</p> <p>The suggestion that councils could relax affordable home requirements in planning deals for developers \u2013 to make projects more affordable when banks are reluctant to lend money \u2013 will be controversial because of the impact on people on low incomes.</p> <p>Labour said the report failed to address rocketing rents in existing homes. The shadow housing minister, Jack Dromey, said: \"As rents hit a record high in July, the government should be acting to address this problem, not looking for ways to water down existing legislation, which could make the problem worse.\"</p> <p>Mike Jones, chairman of the Local Government Association's environment and housing boards, said: \"Any strategy to boost the number of new rental homes should not come at the expense of new affordable housing, and councils will in consultation with their residents always seek to ensure a suitable balance between the need for private rental property and new affordable homes.\"</p> <p>Montague's report says the number of families renting has mushroomed from 2 million in the 1980s to 3.8 million. It says more families are staying in rented accommodation for longer before they can afford to buy property.</p> <p>He recommends that local authorities make fewer demands in return for planning permission and review conditions attached to developments that already have planning permission but have stalled over cost concerns. In return, councils could impose other conditions on owners, for example that new homes have to be available to rent for 10-21 years.</p> <p>The report says the government and local authorities could donate land or even funding to reduce the initial outlay, and so the risk, for developers, in return for a share of the profits when schemes are sold, usually to big institutions such as pension funds which want a steady return for investors.</p> <p>Montague also suggests a taskforce to co-ordinate the government's initiatives. More controversially, he rejects a \"kitemark\" for standards in rented homes but suggests a voluntary code of conduct for accommodation, energy efficiency, repairs and management.</p> <p>Campbell Robb, chief executive of the housing and homelessness charity Shelter, said: \"While we welcome the report's recognition of the need for more and better quality homes for people to rent, it misses a trick in offering nothing for the millions of people already in the sector, paying sky-high rents and living under constant threat of eviction or further rent rises.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Sadness at the BBC and beyond as editors and former colleagues noted the passing of a news titan. In his time on the road, on TV and on radio, John Osman was regarded as one of the elite. East Africa correspondent in the era of Idi Amin, interrogator of Mountbatten over the partition of India. Washington correspondent at the time of Nixon, royal and diplomatic corr. There were many such trailblazers, wrote Jon Williams, BBC World news editor, highlighting the exploits of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2012/08/lawrence_of_asia.html\" title=\"\">Anthony Lawrence</a>, another legend, now 100 years old. \"Lawrence was one of the BBC's 'greatest generation' of foreign correspondents \u2013 a foreign legion that included legendary names such as Charles Wheeler, Erik de Mauny and John Osman. They built the BBC's reputation around the world, on crackly telephone lines and film flown back from distant shores. All have now passed. All but Tony Lawrence.\" Which was fine and certainly respectful. But it came as a shock indeed to close friends of Osman. Hang on a minute, they said, we're pretty sure he isn't dead. And so we did a few checks on their behalf. And they led us to Osman's home in West Sussex. He was not there, but neighbours attested that, barring hitherto undisclosed calamity, the legend lives on, confounding the BBC's account of his demise. Indeed Osman, 83, and his wife Virginia appear to be having the sort of retirement one reads about in the Saga ads. \"They are hardly ever here,\" said his next-door neighbour. \"They go skiing in&#xa0;the winter, sailing in Cyprus in the summer. They have a place in the south of France. At the moment, we think they&#xa0;are in their caravan, driving through Europe.\" A week after first being told of the error, the BBC on Tuesday acknowledged its mistake. \"We are glad that he is still with us and sad that he is not still at the BBC,\" a spokesman said. But Osman couldn't go back. He wouldn't. Too busy.</p> <p>\u2022 Yes, I certainly am busy, he told us when we caught up with him in Croatia. \"We have been away for nine and a half weeks. We have been to Arnhem, Strasbourg and then worked our way through Germany. I am pretty old, but I am delighted to confirm that I am not yet dead.\" He'll be back in September. Life's all go. He's certainly travelling fast enough to evade the grim reaper.</p> <p>\u2022 We might contrast Osman,&#xa0;as a figure of vim and vigour, with&#xa0;the Liberal Democrats, whose lifeblood seems to be draining: death by&#xa0;coalition. <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/death-by-coalition/\" title=\"\">According to an analysis in&#xa0;the latest Prospect magazine</a>, there are four issues the party must quickly address: ideology, policies, brand and leadership. Everything else, if&#xa0;there is anything else, has lesser priority. Still, they are where they are and, as coalition partners, retain the ability to enhance or&#xa0;blight the careers of those who please or vex them. <a href=\"http://ldv.org.uk/29873\" title=\"\">According to a survey</a> by&#xa0;the membership website Liberal Democrat Voice, the&#xa0;top five cabinet faces they like belong to messrs Clarke, Hague, Cable and Davey, though only two-thirds of them smile on Nick Clegg. The recipients of their rotten fruit \u2013 the bottom five \u2013 are Jeremy \"yessir, Mr Murdoch\" Hunt, Voldemort Lansley, Osborne, Gove and&#xa0;Warsi. But there are raspberries too for May and Pickles. The&#xa0;trouble with a bottom five is that only five fit comfortably within it.</p> <p>\u2022 Why are they so useless? Maybe&#xa0;it is because they listen to no one but themselves. Certainly they&#xa0;don't seem to be listening to the advice of civil servants. Prospect flags up the observation from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Riddell\" title=\"\">Peter Riddell</a>, eminence at the Institute of Government, who says permanent secretaries have been leaving their departments at six times the rate of cabinet ministers since May 2010. Some leave for better things. Some just leave, regardless. Those who leave Voldemort Lansley know he will exact his revenge.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, to Ipswich, where Nadia Cenci \u2013 the Tory councillor with a sixth sense <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/16/hugh-muir-diary-nick-herbert\" title=\"\">who just knew global warming was rubbish</a> and who foresaw the financial crash as well as a pending hurricane \u2013 has felt obliged to delete her posting about it all because&#xa0;of&#xa0;the braindead trollery.

  "<p>Even a high contained a low. Such has been the way of things during Steve Kean's troubled reign at Blackburn that victory was overshadowed both by those who were present and those who were not. While Colin Kazim-Richards condemned Hull to a defeat they deserved for their lack of ambition, Ewood Park hosted its lowest league crowd for almost 20 years. Just 13,562 paid to attend, the smallest gate since 1993, when rebuilding limited the capacity.</p> <p>\"I would imagine if we can get another couple of results then people who were a little bit slow to renew their season ticket will come back and see us,\" said an optimistic Kean. However, a half-full ground did include two of the owners; the brothers Venkatesh and Balaji Rao, who can now testify to the manager's enduring unpopularity. If the swathes of empty seats suggested that apathy has replaced dissent, the first chant of \"Kean out,\" albeit from a lone voice, sounded from the stands 17 minutes before kick-off.</p> <p>A louder chorus followed 50 seconds into Ewood Park's first Championship game since 2001 and regularly thereafter. It was amended to \"one-nil and we want Kean out\" after Kazim-Richards scored his second goal in as many games since joining on loan from Galatasaray.</p> <p>The Turkey international hooked in from close range after a succession of miscues and mistakes. Neither Nuno Gomes nor Marcus Olsson connected properly with shots before Joe Dudgeon slammed his attempted clearance into the Swede's chest. It rebounded to Kazim-Richards and Kean's eighth summer signing converted. The makeshift forward is camouflaging a gap in Blackburn's squad by leading the line.</p> <p>\"He thought he wasn't a natural goalscorer but I disagree,\" said Kean. The Scot's search for a striker, which has taken in attempts to borrow Manchester City's John Guidetti and Arsenal's Marouane Chamakh, continues and Rovers have had a third bid for Huddersfield's Jordan Rhodes rejected. Despite that, Gomes only merited a place on the bench, though his cameo contained hints of class.</p> <p>He may be required to start against Leicester on Saturday with Kazim-Richards' knee problem rendering him a doubt. He was ubiquitous. A shirtless goal celebration brought him the game's only caution, a sign of how bloodless it was. \"There wasn't a hive of chances,\" said the Hull manager, Steve Bruce. \"But I thought we had the better.\" Just one was clear-cut, however, and Paul Robinson denied City's \u00a32.5m striker Nick Proschwitz. A lack of goals is their potential problem, \"our Achilles heel,\" as Bruce termed it.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the continuing civil war threatens to destabilise Blackburn. \"I am sure by the time we get another couple of victories the fans will be happy,\" insisted Kean, but only one of the club's powerbrokers has high approval ratings now.</p> <p>Shebby Singh became a cult hero to Rovers fans for suggesting Kean would be sacked if Blackburn lost three successive games. It was surely a footballing first when a section of the crowd called for a global adviser to wave to them. Singh duly obliged, raising a cheer. Only at Ewood Park.</p>",
  "<p>David Brindle (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/20/paralympics-disabled-people-spending-cuts\" title=\"\">Disability movement at a crossroads as Paralympics arrives</a>, 21 August) underestimates the scale of the coalition's attacks on benefits and services for disabled people, and the damage they are causing to the lives of millions of people.</p> <p>The work capability assessment, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/23/gps-work-capability-assessment-scrapped?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">described by the British Medical Association as \"not fit for purpose\"</a>, was designed with the express purpose of removing thousands of people's entitlement to benefit. Reports suggest that many found fit for work after the assessments have subsequently died.</p> <p>These tests are being administered by Atos, a company whose handling of the assessments has been much criticised. It is a disgrace that such a company is sponsoring the Paralympics.</p> <p>The government, however, has responded to the controversy by<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/02/atos-disability-benefit-tests?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"> awarding a further \u00a3400m to Atos</a> to ensure that the number of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jan/18/disability-living-allowance-data\" title=\"\">disability living allowance (DLA) claimants is reduced by 20%</a> \u2013 even though its fraud rate, at 0.5%, is the lowest for any state benefit. Many low-paid workers who qualify for DLA, and who rely on it to survive, will be forced out of work.</p> <p>It is not true that there are no disabled activists these days. We in <a href=\"http://www.dpac.uk.net/\" title=\"\">Disabled People Against Cuts </a>are committed to direct action to stop the criminalising of disabled people as \"cheats\" and \"scroungers\" by the press and government alike. DPAC, and organisations such as Black Triangle, are grassroots organisations of disabled people formed to resist and reverse these attacks.</p> <p>This new disability movement sees itself as part of a wider struggle to resist austerity. We have therefore from the outset sought to unite with the many other non-disabled people organising against the cuts. <br><strong>Ellen Clifford, Rob Murthwaite, Andy Green, Roger Lewis</strong><br><em>National steering committee, Disabled People Against Cut</em>s</p> <p>\u2022\u2008I was one of those disabled leaders instrumental in ensuring people with learning difficulties were included in disability antidiscrimination legislation and had the right to direct payments to support independent living in the mid-90s. Twenty years on, disability discrimination has become much more subtle. Could there be a correlation between the lack of disabled people in work and participating on mainstream professional courses, and the increasing use of psychometric testing based on non- disabled people's norms and experiences? Such tests are used by all sorts of agencies to distribute scarce resources, jobs, housing, benefits and alike. <br><strong>Simone Aspis </strong><br><em>Changing Perspectives</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Arguably the disability movement began in the 1960s, not the 70s, with the establishment of the Disablement Income Group (DIG). Led by the redoubtable Megan du Boisson, it rapidly became a thorn in the side of the then ministry of social security (as an official I was on the receiving end). The pressure exerted by the DIG certainly bore fruit in the 1970s, as benefits for disabled people began to be reformed.<br><strong>Robin Wendt</strong><br><em>Chester</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008David Brindles' account reminded me of the scepticism facing the group that set up Peterborough Shopmobility 30 years ago. Although the new town development corporation was prepared to spend public money in supporting an innovation aimed at improving access for people with mobility problems, there was so little faith that it would be used that the office and store was tucked away on the 11th floor of a multistorey car park, where a discreet veil could be drawn around it when it failed. Now, with more than 350 such services operating in towns and cities across the UK, there is still no room for complacency because, although the idea is proven, the money doesn't flow as easily as in those early days and some schemes have closed due to financial difficulties.<br><strong>Les Bright</strong><br><em>Exeter, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008If, as Frances Hasler is quoted as saying, public transport is the acid test, she might not have taken great pleasure from seeing a wheelchair user abandoned at a bus stop in Hendon Lane, Finchley, a couple of weeks ago. The driver of the 143 bus was apologetic but two large buggies had taken up all the available space. Is it not time for the fold-up pushchair to make a comeback?<br><strong>Anne Hutton</strong><br><em>London </em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008We are looking forward to the Paralympics next week, but no mention has been made of this week's <a href=\"http://london2012.medway.gov.uk/majorsportingevents/britishtransplantgames2012.aspx\" title=\"\">British Transplant Games in Medway (23-26 August)</a>, which help to keep people fit who have had to have some kind of organ transplant.</p> <p>Last year's games in Belfast were a huge success and increased the number of donors joining the register, and if enough people did join the register there could be an end to the waiting&#xa0;lists. <br><strong>Judith and Treve Eddy</strong><br><em>Harlech, Gwynedd</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Philippa Perry's suggestion that \"special needs children\" should not be taught French, mathematics or geography (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/must-not-ignore-disabled-people-learn\" title=\"\">The person we'd like to be</a>, 21 August) made my heart sink. Disabled children continue to suffer from the tyranny of low expectations.</p> <p>My autistic nephew would like to go to a small \"special\" school, which would provide a good educational environment \u2013 but it does not teach geography, a subject in which he has a passionate interest. Thankfully, it does teach French \u2013 a subject in which he has a particular strength because his father is French. Of course, if mainstream schools catered to the full range of educational needs and diversity it would make it possible for all children to attend.</p> <p>As Ms Perry says, difference needs to be acknowledged. But this starts with listening to disabled people themselves, not trotting out third-hand stories about teachers who work with disabled people or relying on the fleeting experience of using a wheelchair while healing a broken leg. Could you allow disabled journalists, academics, psychoanalysts and pupils to speak for themselves?<br><strong>Caroline Gooding</strong><br><em>London</em></p>",
  "<p>A guiding figure behind Tony Blair's education reforms has warned Michael Gove against becoming too obsessed with exams and ignoring skills in favour of teaching children facts.</p> <p>A system that focuses on drilling children through exams risks stifling creativity, <a href=\"http://ippr.org/publication/55/9543/oceans-of-innovation-the-atlantic-the-pacific-global-leadership-and-the-future-of-education\">according to Sir Michael Barber</a>, head of the delivery unit under Tony Blair.</p> <p>Gove has spoken of his admiration for Singapore, where children are streamed into separate bands based on ability.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/22/lessons-education-singapore-gove?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">article for the Guardian</a>, Barber warned: \"At the very moment when Gove is looking east, the east is looking west.\"</p> <p>Leaders in Asian countries realise that their economies need to become more innovative and their schools more creative, Barber argued. \"It is one thing for an education system to produce well-educated deferential citizens; another to produce a generation of innovators. They see that mastery of the basics, while essential, is not enough. They understand too that while exams are important, the obsession with them among parents can be dangerous.\"</p> <p>About 658,000 16-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland received their GCSE results yesterday. Experts have suggested results may reach a plateau this year as exam boards come under increased pressure to curb grade inflation.</p> <p>In his article, Barber, who is now an adviser to education business Pearson, writes: \"The educational challenge for Pacific Asia is to encourage greater diversity and individuality by building on their undoubted high standards in the basics. For Michael Gove, it is to match Pacific Asia's standards in the basics \u2013 which really are basic \u2013 while also developing the capacity to innovate evident in the US.\"</p> <p>There is increasing concern that the system now is inadequate as it allows children to drop English and maths after 16.</p> <p>Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg has called for students to continue studying these core subjects after GCSE. He said: \"We need to go further on English and maths. We are examining this as part of the policy review, requiring some English and maths learning between the ages of 16 and 18.\"</p> <p>Labour has suggested creating a new post-16 qualification in maths that is short of a full A-level, in an attempt to encourage more students to study the subject.</p> <p>Twigg called for a strengthening of vocational education, saying Britain needed to learn from countries like Germany that \"have succeeded in giving practical subjects the kind of status they haven't had in this country\".</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesman said the government was transforming vocational education, citing the expansion of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/may/29/university-technical-colleges-new-schools\" title=\"\">University Technical Colleges</a>, the creation of studio schools and the funding of what he described as \"the biggest apprenticeships programme our country has ever seen\".</p> <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/6298\" title=\"\">called for </a>a \"radical rethink\" of GCSEs on Wednesday, saying that England is unusual in having a school leaving exam at age 16.</p> <p>\"Now that the vast majority stay on past 16 to do further qualifications, there must be some question over the role of a set of exams which may signal to some that leaving at 16 is expected, particularly in the context of government policy to raise the 'education participation age' to 18.\"</p> <p>GCSEs are also used to hold schools to account for their performance, the paper says, and is one of the measures used by universities when making offers to students.</p> <p>But it adds that other accountability measures could be used in league tables.</p> <p>\"It would also be odd to justify retaining GCSEs on the basis they are used for university admissions,\" the paper argues.</p> <p>\"Currently, the majority of children don't go to university and other reforms could improve the flow of information to admissions tutors, such as entrance exams or running the application process after A-level results have been published.\"</p> <p>It concludes: \"Perhaps an even more radical rethink of the role of GCSEs and the structure of the public examination system is called for if we are to ensure that these exams serve a valid purpose and young people are best served for the future.\"</p>",
  "<p>What do we know about pepper? Peps up your food. Makes you sneeze. Was once a&#xa0;greyish powder sprinkled from a pot. Tends, these days, to be wizened black berries crushed in a grinder. Costs not much for a small jar at the supermarket.</p> <p>So far, so exciting. But there is no stopping progress, and, as with olive oil, salt and other basics we once considered boring, pepper is going gourmet. This is not necessarily a bad thing because there is rather more to pepper than you might think.</p> <p>\"It's just the most amazing stuff,\" says Tom Alcott, one half of a company called <a href=\"http://www.peppermongers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Peppermongers</a> that, six months ago, started importing and selling four high-quality, very different varieties of&#xa0;peppercorn.</p> <p>\"Hold a peppercorn and you have world history in your hand,\" says Alcott. \"Ancient India, Rome, the voyages of discovery, the Raj. Our earliest trade routes. A spice so precious it once paid ransoms. This fabulous flavour in Asian, African, European cooking. And yet somehow it&#xa0;has become this bland, uniform, everyday commodity.\"</p> <p>Our oldest and most important spice \u2013 pepper still accounts for 20% of the world spice trade \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.kew.org/plant-cultures/plants/black_pepper_history.html\" title=\"\">has been valued for&#xa0;more than 3,000 years</a>. The plant is&#xa0;native to Kerala, south-west India (the Mahabharata epic, written in the fourth century BC, sings its praises), spreading later to Indonesia and other parts of southern Asia.</p> <p>A lucrative trade with the Roman empire, by sea across the Indian Ocean&#xa0;and then overland to the Mediterranean, was flourishing as early as the first century AD; Pliny writes of black pepper, complaining that there was \"no year in which India does not&#xa0;drain the Roman empire of 50m sesterces\". In AD408, when the Visigoths laid siege to Rome, the marauding hordes were persuaded to leave by mountains of gold, silver, silken tunics and richly painted hides \u2014 plus a ton-and-a-half of peppercorns.</p> <p>After Rome finally fell, Arab, Venetian and Genoese traders took over. In medieval Europe, peppercorns were valuable enough to be accepted for dowries and taxes (\"peppercorn rent\", nowadays a nominal sum, then meant the opposite). Pepper, perhaps, changed history: the world-shrinking sea route to India around Africa, even the broader European discovery and colonisation of the Americas, were in large part driven by the desire for a slice of the precious spice trade.</p> <p>And then, as the transport got easier and the supply multiplied, pepper gradually became just another commodity: inexpensive, and often of&#xa0;very poor quality.</p> <p>\"Whereas in fact,\" says Pete Gibbons, the other half of Peppermongers, \"there are many hundreds of varieties of pepper, each one with its own distinct aroma, flavour and pungency. And everything \u2013 from how it grows on the vine to the time it is harvested and how it is dried, graded and stored \u2013 can affect the quality of the peppercorns we eat.\"</p> <p>These days, Vietnam is the world's largest producer of black pepper; global output swings between 250,000 and 350,000 tonnes a year. Every pepper cultivar, bearing exotic names such as Lampong, Malabar, Sarawak or Wayanad, <a href=\"http://www.kew.org/plant-cultures/plants/black_pepper_production__trade.html\" title=\"\">can produce green, black and white peppercorns</a>. For black pepper, the berries are harvested by hand when fully grown, but still green, then dried mechanically or in the sun. The outer, fleshy layer darkens and shrinks, giving the peppercorns their characteristic wrinkled appearance.</p> <p>Green pepper is made from immature green fruits, which are dehydrated, pickled or bottled. White pepper is actually the inner seed of the berry alone, with the fleshy outer layer removed by soaking.</p> <p>Pepper's spicy heat comes from a compound called piperine, present in&#xa0;both the seed and the outer layer. But it is the outer layer and volatile essential oils that give each variety its distinct aroma and flavour; it follows that white pepper will give you the required burn, but nothing of the rest.</p> <p>That is a shame, because there is a&#xa0;lot to enjoy. Tasting Alcott and Gibbons's varieties fresh-ground on late summer strawberries, the differences are genuinely startling.</p> <p>Tellicherry Garbled Special Extra Bold, officially the highest-quality black pepper in the world, has a biting heat but a distinctive fresh, fruity, woody aroma. Peppercorns are classified as \"bold\", \"extra bold\" or \"special extra bold\", according to their&#xa0;colour, but also graded by size. Only 10% of the crop makes the TGSEB&#xa0;grade.</p> <p>A classic Indonesian pepper, Javanese Cubeb, is noticeably milder in&#xa0;pungency, with strong notes of pine and eucalyptus (Gibbons says the corns were once used as a breath-freshener and the Victorians smoked Cubeb cigarettes). Sichuan flower pepper isn't actually black pepper at all, but the aromatic flower of a bush related to the prickly ash. It exudes a&#xa0;powerful, numbing heat, with floral and citrus aromas.</p> <p>Perhaps the most striking is Indonesian Long Pepper, which the Observer food writer Nigel Slater <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/01/nigel-slater-strawberry-raspberry-recipes\" title=\"\">recently described as</a> \"the most beautiful spice of all\". It comes in long, catkin-like tails, with a strong, spicy but sweet and rounded flavour; it smells of freshly turned earth, nutmeg and cinnamon.</p> <p>In her highly readable book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pepper-Christine-McFadden/dp/1904573606/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345644891&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\">Pepper: The Spice that Changed the World</a>, Christine McFadden quotes the great chef Louis Diat, observing that \"no other spice can do so much for so many different types of food\".</p> <p>So as we pay ever-more attention to the provenance and quality of what we eat, it doesn't seem too excessive to start paying this most ancient of spices a bit more respect \u2013 by exploring its many varieties and, perhaps, demanding a little more than the usual jar of low-grade pepper at the supermarket.</p>",
  "<p>In horror movies, the scariest moments usually come from the monster you can't see. So the same goes for real life, or at least online life. Over the past few years, largely out of sight, governments have been clawing back freedoms on the internet, turning an invention that was designed to emancipate the individual into a tool for surveillance and control. In the next few months, this process is set to be enshrined internationally, amid plans to put cyberspace under the authority of a largely secretive and obscure UN agency.</p> <p>If this succeeds, this will be an important boost to states' plans to censor the web and to use it to monitor citizens. Virtually all governments are at it. Some are much worse than others. The introduction <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/11/russia-internet-censorship?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">last month of a law in Russia creating a blacklist of websites </a>that contain \"extremist\" content was merely the latest example of an alarming trend. Authoritarian states have long seen cyberspace as the ultimate threat to their source of power.</p> <p>They are given succour by self-styled democracies who seek to introduce legislation enhancing the rights of authorities and security agencies to snoop. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/14/online-snooping-home-office-cost?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">British government's current draft communications bill</a> would produce a system of blanket collection and retention of all online data. As the group Privacy International pointed out in its submission to parliament: \"The technology that will be used is only currently deployed in Kazakhstan, China and Iran \u2026 subjecting citizens to the near certainty of ongoing and unremitting interference in their private lives.\"</p> <p>All governments, whatever their hue, cite similar threats: terrorism and organised crime, child pornography and intellectual property are the ones most commonly used. Unsurprisingly these, and local variants, are used by dictatorships, who need merely to point to precedents set in the west to counter any criticism with the charge of hypocrisy.</p> <p>The internet, as originally envisaged, was borderless. In theory, anyone could \u2013 if they had access to the bandwidth \u2013 find out information anywhere and communicate with anyone. The demarcation between free expression and data and identify privacy on the one hand, and the state's right to security on the other, is continually debated and recalibrated, partly due to technological advances.</p> <p>One of the most vigorous places for debate has been the<a href=\"http://www.intgovforum.org/cms/\" title=\"\"> Internet Governance Forum</a>, which since its founding in 2005 has brought together governments, private sector firms large and small, academics and members of civil society. This year's meeting in November takes place incongruously and intriguingly in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, a country with a particularly poor record on free expression and suppression of dissent.</p> <p>What matters, as the lines are drawn, is transparency and inclusivity. If the internet is to be governed more cohesively, and on a less ad hoc basis than now, then it should not be left to governments alone. There has never been a central authority, and the internet has flourished in spite of (or perhaps because of) its decentralised governance model.</p> <p>The reverse is now in prospect. In December in Dubai, a body that has existed for 150 years but few outside narrow industry circles have heard of, is seeking to take control of the internet. The<a href=\"http://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\"> International Telecommunications Union</a> (ITU), a UN organisation that counts 193 countries as its members, aims to add the internet to its existing regulatory roles. Its strongest supporters include regimes such as China, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who submitted a proposal last September to the UN general assembly for an \"international code of conduct for information security\". Its goal is to establish government-led \"international norms and rules standardising the behaviour of countries concerning information and cyberspace\".</p> <p>These countries, and others of their ilk, have three main goals for the Dubai summit and beyond: an assertion of national sovereignty over cyber communication; a clampdown on anonymity and encryption; and a change in global governance. Not that many readers would know as much. Official preparations for the ITU are clouded in secrecy, as is the organisation's standard practice, but information has been coming out via <a href=\"http://wcitleaks.org/\" title=\"\">WCITleaks.org</a>, a website created by two techies to publish leaked documents for the meeting. The ITU describes itself as a \"multi-stakeholder\" organisation, but the claim is spurious. All the big decisions are taken in meetings in which only governments can take part.</p> <p>Lobbying (from all sides) has been taking place for months, but almost completely behind the scenes. Netizens have been shut out from this process.</p> <p>Other cultural and political messages are in play too. Some developing nations and emerging powers are galvanised by the prospect of prising jurisdiction away from the US. This is the most seductive part of their message. Since its inception, the internet has been dominated by the US, both government, corporations, civil society groups and users. This is changing fast. Access to high-speed internet via mobile will transform access to information in developing countries in coming years.</p> <p>The internationalisation of the internet is inevitable, and good. The question is not which countries are in charge, but where the power resides within countries. Control is always the first instinct of the state. The ITU summit in December marks just the start of the battle between those who wish to keep the internet (relatively) free and those who will do everything in their power to reverse the process.</p>",
  "<p>The teenagers anxiously opening their GCSE results on Thursday will be wondering whether they might be among the last to do so. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jun/21/michael-gove-gcses-teaching-union?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">The future of GCSEs is in doubt</a>, as we wait to see how the government moves forward with exam reform and who prevails in the coalition struggle over education policy.</p> <p>We know that the education secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a>, is impressed by Singapore's education system, and there is indeed much to admire. In Singapore, 15-year-olds are 10 months ahead of those in the UK in English. They are 20 months ahead in maths. South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Shanghai match Singapore's performance. So we most definitely have something to learn from Pacific Asia. The question is what?</p> <p>Eastern cultures have valued education for centuries: the belief is that&#xa0;diligence will be rewarded. The \"talent myth\" that is ubiquitous in Atlantic societies \u2013 that either you're smart or you're not \u2013 is roundly rejected. Parents \u2013 such as \"tiger mothers\" \u2013 prize and prioritise education.</p> <p><a href=\"http://ippr.org/publication/55/9543/oceans-of-innovation-the-atlantic-the-pacific-global-leadership-and-the-future-of-education\">Eastern governments do likewise</a>. South Korea pays teachers well, and recruits the best graduates into teaching. It pays for that by having much larger classes; whereas across the Pacific California chose a class size cap, which in effect limited teachers' pay. The former strategy worked; the latter didn't. When President Obama asked South Korea's President Lee about his biggest problem in education, he was told it was parental expectation. Nice problem to have.</p> <p>But at the very moment when Gove is looking east, the east is looking west. Leaders in Pacific Asia are realising that what worked in the last 50 years is not what will be required in the next 50. They have come to the conclusion that their economies need to become more innovative and their schools more creative. It is one thing for an education system to produce well-educated deferential citizens; another to produce a generation of innovators.</p> <p>They see that mastery of the basics, while essential, is not enough. When I talk about the future of the curriculum, including not just knowledge but also ability to lead by influencing those around you, I find a ready audience among leaders of Pacific Asian systems. People understand too that while exams are important, the obsession with them among parents can be dangerous.</p> <p>As the Chinese say, public exams are the batons that conduct the entire orchestra. If students are to develop well across the full range of this emerging curriculum, innovation in tests and exams will be essential. Hong Kong's new exam system began this year, after a decade of careful consultation with parents. The National Institute of Education in Singapore is a hub of innovation in assessment, while the OECD as a whole is looking to assess collaborative problem-solving from 2015 onwards. The best computer games may be a good pointer to the assessment revolution ahead.</p> <p>The educational challenge for Pacific Asia is to encourage greater diversity and individuality by building on its undoubted high standards in the basics. For Gove it is to match Pacific Asia's standards in the basics \u2013 which really are basic \u2013 while also developing the capacity to innovate that is evident in the US. As Arne Duncan, the US education secretary, told me: \"The US is still ahead in experimentation \u2026 we have many islands of excellence.\" However, the US struggles to apply to the system the lessons from those islands.</p> <p>In future, education systems will need to combine a high-quality, reliable system with the capacity to innovate at scale. Pacific Asian countries know this only too well and are beginning to move in the right direction. We don't yet know what Gove plans for the exam system. As he makes up his mind, it will be important for him to learn not just from where Singapore is, but also where it is heading.</p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below - Update II)</strong></p> <p>Earlier this week, British lawyer and legal correspondent for the New Statesman David Allen Green generated a fair amount of attention by <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2012/08/five-legal-myths-about-assange-extradition\">announcing that he would use his objective legal expertise</a> to bust what he called \"legal myths about the Assange extradition.\" These myths, he said, are being irresponsibly spread by Assange defenders and \"are like 'zombie facts' which stagger on even when shot down.\" </p> <p>In addition to his other credentials, Green \u2013 like virtually the entire British press \u2013 is a <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/human-rights/2012/06/desperation-julian-assange\">long-time and deeply devoted Assange-basher</a>, and his purported myth-busting was <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5936600/\">predictably regurgitated</a> by those who reflexively grasp onto anything that reflects poorly on western establishmentarians' public enemy No1. It's really worth examining what Green argued to understand the behavior in which Assange detractors engage to advance this collective vendetta, and also to see how frequently blatant ideological agendas masquerade as high-minded, objective legal expertise.</p> <p>But before getting to that, let us pause to reflect on a truly amazing and revealing fact, one that calls for formal study in several academic fields of discipline. Is it not remarkable that one of the very few individuals over the past decade to risk his welfare, liberty and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334341/WikiLeaks-Sarah-Palin-demands-Julian-Assange-hunted-like-Al-Qaeda-terrorist.html\">even</a><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/07/fox-news-bob-beckel-calls_n_793467.html\"> life</a> to meaningfully challenge the secrecy regime on which the American national security state (and those of its <a href=\"http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/03/un-torture-investigator-warns-uk-over.php\">obedient allies</a>) depends just so happens to have become \u2013 long before he sought asylum from Ecuador \u2013 the most intensely and personally despised figure among the American and British media class and the British \"liberal\" intelligentsia? </p> <p>In 2008 \u2013 two years before the release of the \"collateral murder\" video, the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, and the diplomatic cables \u2013 the Pentagon <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/us/18wiki.html\">prepared a secret report</a> which proclaimed WikiLeaks to be an enemy of the state and <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MnYI3_FRbbQ/S64J1rmc53I/AAAAAAAACWI/wiLUSVixG5U/s1600/pentagon2.png\">plotted ways to destroy</a> its credibility and reputation. But in a stroke of amazing luck, Pentagon operatives never needed to do any of that, because the establishment media in the US and Britain harbor at least as much intense personal loathing for the group's founder as the US government does, and eagerly took the lead in targeting him. Many people like to posit the US national security state and western media outlets as adversarial forces, but here \u2013 as is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/international/middleeast/26FTE_NOTE.html?pagewanted=all\">so often the case</a> \u2013 they have so harmoniously joined in common cause.</p> <p>Whatever else is true, establishment media outlets show unlimited personal animus toward the person who, as a panel of judges <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/02/julian-assange-martha-gelhorn-prize\">put it</a> when they awarded him the the 2011 Martha Gellhorn prize for journalism, \"has given the public more scoops than most journalists can imagine.\" Similarly, when the Australian version of the Pulitzers \u2013 the Walkley Foundation \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.walkleys.com/news/5131/\">awarded its highest distinction</a> (for \"Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism\") to WikiLeaks in 2011, it <a href=\"http://www.walkleys.com/2011winners#most-outstanding-contribution-to-journalism\">cited</a> the group's \"courageous and controversial commitment to the finest traditions of journalism: justice through transparency,\" and observed: \"So many eagerly took advantage of the secret cables to create <em>more scoops in a year than most journalists could imagine in a lifetime</em>.\"</p> <p>When it comes to the American media, I've <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/11/30/wikileaks_10/\">long noted</a> this revealing paradox. The person who (along with whomever is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/14/bradley-manning-deserves-a-medal\">the heroic leaker</a>) enabled \"more scoops in a year than most journalists could imagine in a lifetime\" \u2013 and who was quickly branded an enemy by the Pentagon and a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/19/joe-biden-wikileaks-assange-high-tech-terrorist_n_798838.html\">terrorist by high U.S. officials</a> \u2013 is the most hated figure among establishment journalists, even though they are ostensibly devoted to precisely these values of transparency and exposing serious government wrongdoing. (This transparency was imposed not only <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/12/24/wikileaks_23/\">on the US and its allies</a>, but also some of the <a href=\"http://ggdrafts.blogspot.com.br/2011/10/bill-keller-on-wikileaks-cables.html\">most oppressive regimes in the Arab world</a>). </p> <p>But the contempt is far more intense, and bizarrely personal, from the British press, much of which behaves with staggering levels of mutually-reinforcing vindictiveness and groupthink when it's time to scorn an outsider like Assange. On Tuesday, Guardian columnist Seumas Milne wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/21/why-us-is-out-to-get-assange\">a superb analysis</a> of British media coverage of Assange, and observed that \"the virulence of British media hostility towards the WikiLeaks founder is now unrelenting.\" Milne noted that to the British press, Assange \"is nothing but a 'monstrous narcissist', a bail-jumping 'sex pest' and an exhibitionist maniac\" \u2013 venom spewed at someone \"who has yet to be charged, let alone convicted, of anything.\"</p> <p>Indeed, the personalized nature of this contempt from self-styled sober journalists often borders on the creepy (when it's not wildly transgressing that border). Former New York Times' executive editor Bill Keller infamously quoted an email from a Times reporter <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/magazine/30Wikileaks-t.html?pagewanted=all\">claiming</a> that Assange wore \"filthy white socks that collapsed around his ankles\" and \"smelled as if he hadn't bathed in days.\" On the very same day WikiLeaks released over 400,000 classified documents showing genuinely horrific facts about massive civilian deaths in the Iraq war and US complicity in torture by Iraqi forces, the New York Times front-paged <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/24assange.html?hp\">an article</a> purporting to diagnose Assange with a variety of psychological afflictions and concealed, malicious motives, based on its own pop-psychology observations and those of Assange's enemies (\"erratic and imperious behavior\", \"a nearly delusional grandeur\", \"he is not in his right mind\", \"pursuing a vendetta against the United States\").</p> <p>A columnist for the Independent, Joan Smith, recently watched Assange's interview of Ecuadorean president Rafeal Correa and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/joan-smith/joan-smith-why-do-we-buy-julian-assanges-oneman-psychodrama-7869897.html\">offered up this wisdom</a>: \"He's put on weight, his face is puffy and he didn't bother to shave before his interview with Correa.\" And perhaps most psychologically twisted of all: a team of New York Times reporters and editors last week, in its lead article about Ecuador's decision to grant asylum, decided it would be appropriate to <a href=\"http://gregmitchellwriter.blogspot.com.br/2012/08/nyt-flushes-assange-charges.html\">include a quote</a> from one of Assange's most dedicated enemies claiming that when the WikiLeaks founder was a visitor in his apartment, he \"refused to flush the toilet during his entire stay\" (faced with a barrage of mockery and disgust over their reporting on Assange's alleged toilet habits, the NYT sheepishly deleted that passage without comment).</p> <p>It is difficult to think of anyone this side of Saddam Hussein who triggers this level of personalized, deeply ingrained hatred from establishment journalists. Few who spew this vitriol would dare speak with the type of personalized scorn toward, say, George Bush or Tony Blair \u2013 who actually launched an aggressive war that resulted in the deaths of at least 100,000 innocent people and kidnapped people from around the globe with no due process and sent them to be tortured. The reaction Assange inspires among establishment media figures is really sui generis.</p> <p>It is vital to note, as was just demonstrated, that this media contempt long pre-dates, and exists wholly independent of, the controversy surrounding the sex assault allegations in Sweden, and certainly long pre-dates his seeking of asylum from Ecuador. Indeed, given that he has not been convicted of anything, to assume Assange's guilt would be reprehensible \u2013 every bit as reprehensible as concluding that the allegations are a CIA ruse or that the complainants' allegations should be dismissed as frivolous or inherently untrustworthy. </p> <p>It would be genuinely nice to think that the same British government that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/13/pinochet.chile6\">refused to extradite</a> the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/victims-of-pinochets-police-prepare-to-reveal-details-of-rape-and-torture-1183793.html\">mass rapist</a> Augusto Pinochet has suddenly developed a devoted passion for ensuring that alleged sex assault offenders are brought to justice \u2013 just as it would be nice to believe that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/21/human-rights-critics-russia-ecuador\">sudden interest</a> in denouncing Ecuador's press freedom record was driven by some newly discovered and authentic concern in the west for civil liberties protections in South America. But as Milne put it last night with great understatement: \"such posturing looks increasingly specious.\" As he rhetorically asked:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Can anyone seriously believe the dispute would have gone global, or that the British government would have made its asinine threat to suspend the Ecuadorean embassy's diplomatic status and enter it by force, or that scores of police would have surrounded the building, swarming up and down the fire escape and guarding every window, if it was all about one man wanted for questioning over sex crime allegations in Stockholm?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Like those who suddenly discover the imperatives of feminism when it comes time to justify the war in Afghanistan, or those who become overnight advocates of gay rights when it comes time to demonize the regime in Tehran, or those who took a very recent interest in Ecuadorean press freedoms, these sex assault allegations -- as serious and deserving of legal resolution as they are -- are being cynically exploited as a political weapon by many who have long despised Assange for reasons entirely independent of this case.</p> <p>* * * * * </p> <p>There are several obvious reasons why Assange provokes such unhinged media contempt. The most obvious among them is competition: the resentment generated by watching someone outside their profession generate more critical scoops in a year than all other media outlets combined (see <a href=\"http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/001990.html\">this brilliant 2008 post</a>, in the context of the Clintons, about how professional and ego-based competition produces personal hatred like nothing else can).</p> <p>Other causes are more subtle though substantive. Many journalists (and liberals) like to wear the costume of outsider-insurgent, but are, at their core, devoted institutionalists, faithful believers in the goodness of their society's power centers, and thus resent those (like Assange) who actually and deliberately place themselves outside of it. By putting his own liberty and security at risk to oppose the world's most powerful factions, Assange has clearly demonstrated what happens to real adversarial dissidents and insurgents \u2013 they're persecuted, demonized, and threatened, not befriended by and invited to parties within the halls of imperial power \u2013 and he thus causes many journalists to stand revealed as posers, servants to power, and courtiers.</p> <p>Then there's the ideological cause. As one long-time British journalist told me this week when discussing the vitriol of the British press toward Assange: \"Nothing delights British former lefties more than an opportunity to defend power while pretending it is a brave stance in defence of a left liberal principle.\" That's the warped mindset that led to so many of these self-styled liberal journalists <a href=\"http://eustonmanifesto.org/the-euston-manifesto/\">to support the attack on Iraq</a> and other acts of Western aggression in the name of liberal values. And it's why nothing triggers their rage like fundamental critiques of, and especially meaningful opposition to, the institutions of power to which they are unfailingly loyal.</p> <p>* * * * * </p> <p>With that context established, let us return to David Allen Green. The attacks on those who have defended Assange's extradition and asylum arguments has depended on the disgusting slander that such advocates are indifferent to the allegations of sexual assault made against him or, worse, are \"rape apologists.\" </p> <p>The reality is exactly the opposite. I have spoken to countless Assange defenders over the last couple of years and not a single one \u2013 literally not one \u2013 is dismissive of the need for those allegations in Sweden to be taken seriously and to be legally and fairly resolved. Typifying this view is Milne's column last night, which in the midst of scorning the attacks on Assange, embraced \"the seriousness of the rape allegations made against Assange, for which he should clearly answer and, if charges are brought, stand trial.\" </p> <p>That is the view of every Assange defender with a platform that I know of, including me (one can certainly find anonymous internet commenters, or the occasional named one, making actual, horrific rape apologist claims, but one can find stray advocates saying anything; imputing those views to Assange defenders generally would be like claiming that all Assange critics want to see him illegally shot in the head or encaged for life because <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334341/WikiLeaks-Sarah-Palin-demands-Julian-Assange-hunted-like-Al-Qaeda-terrorist.html\">some prominent American</a> and <a href=\"http://www.peopleokwithmurderingassange.com/the_list.html\">other commentators</a> have <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRMV7zi4h_k\">called for this</a>).</p> <p>Not only Assange defenders, but also his own lawyers and the Ecuadorean government, have worked relentlessly to ensure that <em>he faces those allegations in Sweden</em>. They have merely sought to do so in a way that protects him from extradition to the US to face espionage charges for his journalism \u2013 a threat that could send him to prison for life (likely in a torturous super-max facility), and a threat only the wilfuly blind could deny is <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/29/AR2010112905973.html\">serious and real</a>. </p> <p>In their <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/opinion/wikileaks-and-the-global-future-of-free-speech.html?ref=opinion\">New York Times op-ed this week</a>, Michael Moore and Oliver Stone correctly argue that it is \"the British and Swedish governments that stand in the way of [the sex assault] investigation, not Mr Assange.\" That's because, they note, Assange has repeatedly offered to be questioned by Swedish authorities in London, or to travel <em>today</em> to Sweden to face those allegations if he could be assured that his doing so would not result in his extradition to the US to face espionage charges. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/21/rafael-correa-britain-julian-assange_n_1820515.html\">Time and again</a>, \"Correa said Ecuador never intended to stop Assange from facing justice in Sweden. 'What we've asked for is guarantees that he won't be extradited to a third country,' he said.\" Both <em>Britain and Sweden have steadfastly refused even to discuss any agreement that could safeguard both the rights of the complainants and Assange's rights not to be imprisoned for basic journalism.</em></p> <p>These facts \u2013 and they are facts \u2013 pose a lethal threat to the key false narrative that Assange and his defenders are motivated by a desire to evade his facing the sex assault allegations in Sweden. So these facts need to be impugned, and that's where David Allen Green and his \"myth-busting\" legal expertise comes into play.</p> <p>One myth Green purports to debunk is the notion that \"the Swedes should interview Assange in London.\" This cannot be, Green argues, because \"Assange is not wanted merely for questioning. He is wanted for arrest.\" He also echoes numerous other Assange critics by arguing that the \"he-has-not-yet-been-charged\" claim is a mere technical irrelevancy: the only reason this is true, he says, is because he must be in Sweden for that to happen.</p> <p>But back in early 2011, Assange critics were telling a much different story. Back then, they were arguing that Assange was wildly overstating the danger he faced from extradition to Sweden because the investigation there was at such a preliminary stage and he was merely wanted for questioning. Indeed, here's what the very same David Allen Green <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2011/02/assange-eaw-sexual-sweden\">wrote on 28 February 2011</a> when explaining the status of the investigation to his readers [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"This extradition order does not necessarily mean, of course, that he will be extradited, <em>still less that he will be charged</em>, tried, or convicted. Assange may win an appeal of the extradition order, or Sweden may decide either not to continue or to <em>interview him while he remains in England</em>. However, unless some such external event intervenes, Assange will be shortly extradited to Sweden <em>to be questioned</em> about an allegation of rape, two allegations of sexual molestation, and an allegation of unlawful coercion.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Back when it suited Green, he emphasized that Assange has not been charged with any crime, that there is far from any certainty that he would be, and that extradition to Sweden is merely for him \"to be questioned\" on these allegations: exactly the \"myths\" and \"zombie facts\" which he now purports to bust. Moreover, Swedish law professor Marten Schultz, who strongly supports Assange's extradition to Sweden, has <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/justice-for-sweden\">said the same</a> [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The UK supreme court's decision means <em>only that Assange will be transferred to Sweden for interrogation. </em>It does not mean that he will be tried, or <em>even charged</em>. It is entirely possible that he will be transferred to Sweden, questioned, and released if the Swedish authorities find that there are insufficient grounds for prosecution. It is impossible \u2013 as it should be \u2013 to predict how the case will unfold.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Clearly, as Green himself used to acknowledge, Assange at this point is wanted for questioning in this case, and has not been charged. Once he's questioned, he might be charged, or the case might be dropped. That is what has made the Swedes' steadfast refusal to question him in England so mystifying, of such concern to Assange, and is the real reason that the investigation has thus far been obstructed. Indeed, Swedish legal expert Ove Bring has <a href=\"https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=5235707\">made clear</a>, in the context of discussing Assange, that \"under Swedish law it is possible to interrogate people abroad,\" but that Sweden is refusing to do so simply for reasons of \"prestige\" (he added: \"If he goes to Sweden, is interrogated, then I expect the case would be dropped, as <em>the evidence is not enough to charge him with a crime</em>\").</p> <p>Then there's the very strange argument Green makes about why extradition to the US would be more easily accomplished if he's in Britain rather than Sweden. I've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/20/julian-assange-right-asylum\">previously set out</a> the reasons and supporting evidence showing the reverse is true and won't repeat those here, but let's look at what Green says to support his claim:</p> <blockquote> <p>One can add that there is no evidence whatsoever that the United Kingdom would not swiftly comply with any extradition request from the United States; quite the reverse. Ask Gary McKinnon, or Richard O'Dwyer, or the NatWest Three.</p> </blockquote> <p>The US has been seeking McKinnon's extradition from Britain for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/24/gary-mckinnon-extradition-review-hacker\">a full seven years and counting</a>; O'Dwyer also remains in England and is the subject of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/06/richard-odwyer-extradition-opposed-majority\">popular campaign to block his shipment to the U.S.</a>; the NatWest Three were able to<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5160094.stm\"> resist extradition to the US for four full years</a>. These cases disprove, rather than prove, that an extradition demand from the US would be \"swiftly complied with\" in Britain. In contrast to the secretive Swedish judicial system, there is substantial public debate along with transparent (and protracted) judicial proceedings in Britain over extradition.</p> <p>It is true, as Green notes, that the Swedish government cannot provide an iron-clad \"guarantee\" that Assange would not be extradited to the US. That's because it is Swedish courts, and not the government, that make the ultimate decision on extradition. But both the British and Swedish governments play an important role in any extradition proceeding: they take influential positions on whether extradition is legally warranted. Under Britain's extradition treaty, it must consent to the subsequent extradition of any individual it extradites (meaning its consent would be needed for Sweden to send Assange to the U.S.), while in Sweden, the government <a href=\"http://www.firmmagazine.com/features/1179/Assange_-_what%27s_going_on%3F.html\">must formally opine</a> on whether extradition should take place (some Swedes have<a href=\"http://ibnkafkasobiterdicta.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-julian-assange-circus-why-is-carl-bildt-lying/\"> made the case</a> that the government's position would be dispositive).</p> <p>At the very least, there is ample room for negotiation. Both the British and Swedish governments could \u2013 and should \u2013 take the position that to prosecute Assange under espionage statutes for acts of journalism would be political crimes that are not subject to their extradition treaties with the U.S. or are otherwise not cognizable extradition offenses. Rather than explore any of those possible grounds for agreement, both governments have simply refused to negotiate either with Assange's lawyers or the Ecuadorean government over any proposals to safeguard his rights. That refusal on the part of those governments \u2013 and not any desire to obstruct the investigation or evade facing those allegations \u2013 is what led the Ecuadoreans to conclude that asylum was necessary to protect Assange from political persecution.</p> <p>The complainants in Sweden have the absolute right to have their serious allegations against Assange investigated and legally resolved. But Assange has the equally compelling right under international law and treaties to be free of political persecution: which is exactly what prosecuting him (and perhaps imprisoning him for life) in the US for WikiLeaks' disclosures would be. </p> <p>It is vital that both sets of rights be safeguarded, not just one. The only just solution is one that protects both. Assange's lawyers and the Ecuadorians have repeatedly pursued arrangements to vindicate all substantial rights at stake so that he can travel to Sweden \u2013 today \u2013 to face those allegations while being protected against unjust extradition to the US. It is the refusal of the British and Swedish authorities even to consider any such proposals that have brought this situation to the unfortunate standstill it is in.</p> <p>It is incredibly telling that media attacks on Assange do not even pay lip service to, let alone evince any actual interest in, the profound threats to press freedom that would come if he were extradited to and tried in the United States. In lieu of being informed about any of this, readers and viewers are bombarded with disturbing, and often quite disturbed, rants driven by unrestrained personal contempt. That contempt not only drowns out every important value at stake in this case, but also any regard for the basic facts.</p> <p>* * * </p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: Numerous people objected that I too readily conceded the point that Swedish courts, rather than the Swedish government, are the ultimate decision-makers on extradition requests, and the Swedish government therefore cannot provide Assange with a guarantee that he will not be extradited to the U.S. <a href=\"http://ibnkafkasobiterdicta.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-julian-assange-circus-why-is-carl-bildt-lying/\">This article</a> by a lawyer -- who fervently believes that Assange should be extradited to Sweden -- makes the case very compellingly that the Swedish government most certainly can provide such a guarantee if it chose to [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>Extradition procedures are typically of a mixed nature, where courts and governments share the final decision \u2013 it is not unknown for <em>governments to reject an extradition request in spite of court verdict allowing it</em>. . . . </p> <p>Article 12 [of Sweden's extradition law] adds that the government may put conditions on its decision to accept an extradition request. <em>The deciding body is thus the government</em>, with an input by the Prosecutor general and a veto right given to the Supreme Court in case where the requested person doesn't accept to be extradited.</p> </blockquote> <p>The article goes on to cite the Swedish extradition law to outline two possible outcomes where the target of an extradition request challenges its validity: (1) the Swedish supreme court rules that extradition is not legally permissible, in which case the Swedish government is not free to extradite; (2) the Swedish supreme court rules that extradition is legally permissible, in which case the Swedish government is free to decide that it will not extradite for policy or other prudential reasons. In other words, the Swedish judiciary has the right to <em>block</em> an extradition request on legal grounds, but it lacks the power to<em> compel</em> extradition; if the courts approve of the legal basis, the Swedish government still retains the authority to decide if extradition should take place.</p> <p>As indicated, even if it were true that Swedish government was an unable to offer Assange a so-called \"iron-clad guarantee\" against extradition, there is still grounds to negotiate in order to have him travel to Sweden to face these allegations; given that the Swedish government clearly has, at the very least, a significant role to play in the process, its advanced position against Assange's extradition to the U.S. on the basis of WikiLeaks' journalistic disclosures would be significant. But there is at least a strong argument to make, if not an irrefutable one, that the Swedish government is able to offer precisely the guarantee that both Assange and Ecuadorean authorities have sought in order to enable him immediately to travel to Sweden to face the sex assault allegations against him. Independently, the British government is also clearly in a position to contribute to those assurances, given the need for its consent if extradition to the U.S. from Sweden is to take place. </p> <p>If one wants to find a culprit for why these sex assault allegations are not being resolved the way they should be, the refusal of these two governments even to negotiate to secure Assange's clear rights against unjust extradition is the place to begin.</p> <p>* * * </p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE II</em></strong>: For even more compelling evidence that the Swedish government is the final decision-maker in extradition matters and does indeed have the power to guarantee Assange that he would not be extradited to the U.S. based on his journalism, see the citations in Point 3 of <a href=\"http://pastehtml.com/view/c91yw7wjy.html\">this excellent reply to Green</a>.</p>",
  "<p>'The talented and hard-working have nothing to fear,\" says Dominic Raab, Conservative MP for Esher and Walton, with just the faintest hint of menace. It is an airless, lazy day in mid-August. The House of Commons cafe is half-deserted. But Raab, firm-jawed, slightly gaunt and a rising star of the Tory right, is spending the parliamentary recess in the traditional manner of ambitious politicians: using the Westminster news vacuum to attract attention to himself and his ideas.</p> <p>Wearing jeans, the 38-year-old backbencher is talking \u2013 warily \u2013 about transforming the British workplace. He thinks current employment law offers \"excessive protections\" to workers. \"People who are coasting \u2013 it should be easier to let them go, to give the unemployed a chance. It is a delicate balancing act, but it should be decided in favour of the latter.\"</p> <p>Last Friday, a leaked fragment from a book co-written by Raab and four other Conservative MPs, Britannia Unchained: Global Lessons for Growth and Prosperity, due to be published next month, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tackle-lazy-britain-fellow-tories-tell-david-cameron-8056787.html\" title=\"\">appeared in the London Evening Standard</a>. The passage, red meat for phone-ins and columnists ever since, argued less politely for an improvement in our national work ethic: \"The British are among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor. Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in football and pop music.\"</p> <p>Further detailed revelations about the book remain forbidden by a pre-publication embargo. But having read it, I can safely say that Britannia Unchained has a brevity, pace and scope that elevates it a little above the usual pre-party-conference polemics. \"Britain is at a crossroads which will define our place in the world for generations,\" begins one of its publisher's sales pitches. \"From our economy, to our education system, to social mobility and social justice, we must learn the rules of the 21st century, or we face an inevitable slide into mediocrity.\"</p> <p>When I speak to Raab again after the Evening Standard extract, he says it gave \"a skewed and inaccurate reflection of what is in the book\". Yet over the last year he and his co-authors, all of them members of a new Conservative parliamentary faction called the <a href=\"http://www.freeenterprise.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Free Enterprise Group</a>, have made little secret of the harsh medicine they believe Britain needs to take. Last year, for example, Raab wrote a <a href=\"http://www.cps.org.uk/publications/reports/q/ref-438/\" title=\"\">paper</a> for the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) \u2013 since the birth of Thatcherism one of the radical right's fiercest thinktanks \u2013 urging that \"the definition of fair dismissal should be widened ... to encompass inadequate performance ... [This] would help employers get the best from their staff.\" The paper also argued for exempting small businesses from paying the minimum wage for under-21s, the already <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/TheNationalMinimumWage/DG_10027201\" title=\"\">less-than-lavish hourly sum of between \u00a33.68 and \u00a34.98</a>.</p> <p>Raab has been an MP barely two years. Before winning a huge majority of 18,593 in one of the wealthiest seats in the country, he studied law at Oxford and Cambridge, practised in the City of London, and worked at the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office. He only joined the Conservative party in 2005, after the worst of its modern slump was over. Yet during our interview, it steadily becomes clearer that his confidence derives from more than this assured personal trajectory. There is also his belief that the radical right's time is coming. \"I'm a big Thatcher fan,\" he says, dropping his guard a little as the interview approaches its end. \"The coalition has done a lot of good incremental work, on the deficit and so on. Do I think we need a more decisive shift to build on what the coalition has done? The answer is a definite yes.\"</p> <p>It may come as a surprise to those who already consider the coalition a tough government, with its hairshirt rhetoric and seemingly endless spending cuts, but a growing number of Tory backbenchers, business figures, commentators and thinkers feel that the coalition \u2013 and by implication, other austerity governments across the west \u2013 is not nearly tough enough. Since 2011, as the British economy has slumped, this energetic but largely unnoticed political alliance, somewhere between a lobby group and a proper movement, has begun to show its strength.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395084848\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/22/1345651059976/Elizabeth-Truss-a-member--010.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Truss, a member of the Free Enterprise Group.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Truss, a member of the Free Enterprise Group. Photograph: Karen Robinson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since last autumn there has been the smouldering controversy about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/may/23/beecroft-proposals-coalition-support-criticism\" title=\"\">Beecroft Report</a>, a government-commissioned review of employment law by the powerful venture capitalist and Tory donor Adrian Beecroft. His recommendations, even more wide-ranging than Raab's \u2013 including the loosening of regulations covering the employment of children \u2013 have so far proved too contentious to be adopted by the increasingly fragile coalition. But they have become close to a sacred cause for the administration's proliferating critics in the rightwing press. Sometimes the demands for bolder government are frank: \"<a href=\"https://acs.thesundaytimes.co.uk/?gotoUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesundaytimes.co.uk%2Fsto%2Fbusiness%2FEconomy%2Farticle1036963.ece\" title=\"\">Come on Dave, be brave</a>,\" [paywall] urged the Sunday Times in May. \"A bonfire of regulation was promised, but few businesses report any relaxation in red tape.\" Sometimes the demands are more oblique: last month, a series of Daily Telegraph articles themed as <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/britain-unleashed-the-future-of/\" title=\"\">\"Britain Unleashed\"</a> mixed essays on the virtues of unfettered capitalism with admiring references to other countries \u2013 usually Asian \u2013 where supposedly more red-blooded free markets operate.</p> <p>In January, the chief executive of Britain's biggest insurer Prudential, Tidjane Thiam, told the annual gathering of the global elite at Davos that across Europe, \"the minimum wage is a machine to destroy jobs.\" Speaking at the South Bank Centre in London the following week, the far-sighted BBC economics journalist and author Paul Mason interpreted Thiam's remarks as a sign of an emerging \"more radical version of neoliberalism, where we're basically, finally, told: 'The race to the bottom, to be like China, is on, and we're all going to do it. So your wages will meet the Chinese somewhere, and so will your social conditions ... abolish minimum wages, abolish social protection.\" In the audience, which had gathered to hear Mason talk about the leftwing, street-politics response to the economic crisis, not a formidable new rightwing one as well, there were a few seconds of uncomfortable silence.</p> <p>\"The European economic and welfare model \u2013 I think it's over,\" says Mark Littlewood, director of the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), like the CPS a veteran British free-market thinktank reinvigorated by current possibilities. He favours cutting state spending in Britain by over a third, and leaving citizens with a \"basic safety net\". Yet he finds the coalition far too cautious. \"There has been an incredibly modest reduction in public spending. It's as if the coalition have arrived at the scene of a road accident: they've urgently applied a tourniquet to the bleeding patient, but that's it. There's no rehabilitation programme to make the patient leaner, meaner, fitter.\" In part, he blames Tory fears about their party becoming \"retoxified\": \"I've argued at the top levels of government, 'Scrap the minimum wage.' But then there's a sharp intake of breath. Anything that looks like a return to the Dickensian workhouse raises hackles. But I don't want people working in sweatshops at 5p an hour. You should sell abolishing the minimum wage in positive terms, as providing young people with a first step on the jobs ladder, as a 'jobs for all' scheme.\"</p> <p>Tim Montgomerie, editor of the influential Tory website <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">Conservative Home</a>, says the coalition has placed itself in the worst of both worlds, \"talking tough but not acting tough\". Also, until late 2008, well into the financial crisis, the Tories supported increases in public spending over deficit reduction; then they abruptly reversed their position. Montgomerie argues that this opportunistic radicalism is not respected by voters, hence the government's poor poll ratings. Like Littlewood and others, he favours a more authentically bold approach, a \"rescue plan for the country\" involving much deeper spending cuts, a loosening of the planning system and reduced employee protections.</p> <p>\"It's a pretty depressing time for the Conservative party,\" says Montgomerie, \"but the thing that gives me hope is the [parliamentary] class of 2010, and all the groups they've formed. Of those groups, the Free Enterprise Group is <em>the</em> group. They're quite spiky in their opinions, but well respected by the Conservative leadership. They are George Osborne's favourites. He has spoken to them. In some ways, it helps him to have them, so he can say, 'I'm not the [government's rightwing] outrider.'\" In June, a <a href=\"http://www.exacteditions.com/read/the-spectator/23-june-2012-31697/12/3/\" title=\"\">cover story</a> on the group in the Tory house magazine the Spectator announced, \"Not since the late 1970s has there been a group of Tories thinking so hard, with such freedom, about the future of their country.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395084849\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/22/1345651169409/Priti-Patel----a-potentia-010.jpg\" alt=\"Priti Patel \u2026  a potential party leader?\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Priti Patel \u2026  a potential party leader? Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Founded in October 2011, the group lists 38 supporting MPs on its website. The membership is youngish, more female and less white than the Conservative parliamentary party as a whole. It includes many of the new MPs currently identified by Tory-watchers as potential party leaders, including Raab, Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel and Elizabeth Truss. The fact that David Cameron leads a coalition rather than a Conservative administration has given the group a rare freedom to criticise government policy and suggest alternatives. Sometimes these are less fearsome than you might expect \u2013 Raab likes the French healthcare system; Truss admires the German economy \u2013 but often the foreign models cited are Asian, and the underlying message for Britons is relentless: raw capitalism is the only game in town, and you need to start working much harder. \"We can all <em>graft</em>,\" says Raab.</p> <p>The group do not expect this revolution to happen overnight. Last year, Raab and his co-authors published a predecessor to Britannia Unchained for a smaller publisher, titled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/After-Coalition-Kwasi-Kwarteng/dp/1849541582\" title=\"\">After the Coalition: A Conservative Agenda for Britain</a>. \"The last 30 years of public debate in Britain has been dominated by leftwing thinking,\" the introduction rather startlingly declared, as if the transformative 18 years of the Thatcher and Major governments had never happened. On the new radical right, there is sometimes a reluctance to compare the changes envisaged for Britain to Thatcherism: partly, you suspect, because the supposed need for these changes implies that her rightwing project, to a degree, failed; and partly because she was just so divisive. \"Raab and the Free Enterprise Group are a million miles away from Norman Tebbit in the way they present their arguments,\" says Littlewood.</p> <p>Yet he and the others may have to wait longer than the next general election before implementing their vision of what you could call \"austerity max\". A Tory majority in 2015 looks increasingly unlikely, let alone one big enough to sustain a truly iconoclastic government. And would ever more radical policies really revive the party's sagging popularity? Labour leftwingers were derided in the early 80s for making exactly that argument. History proved their critics at least partly right. Also, Montgomerie acknowledges, all the coalition's austerity rhetoric since 2010 means that \"Toughness is a harder sell now [for the Tory radicals]. The government has already played the 'tough' card.\"</p> <p>Public opinion has turned flintier in recent years on welfare spending. But such a mood swing often occurs at the end of Labour administrations and the beginning of Conservative ones, and often reverses, into distaste at an \"uncaring\" government, once the British right has been in power for a few years. The popular mandate for the coalition's broader spending cuts, if it ever truly existed, has already crumbled. And on tax and capitalism in general, public opinion is, if anything, moving leftwards, as tax cheats and feckless bankers solidify into popular demons. Littlewood admits, \"There isn't yet a readiness from the British public to say, 'We've got to go back to the [rightwing] drawing board.'\"</p> <p>In radical right circles, it is strikingly common to hear comparisons between Cameron's government and that of his Tory predecessor Edward Heath: narrowly elected in 1970, briefly tough before a chaos of U-turns, replaced in 1974 by an often equally beleaguered Labour administration \u2013 before the right's big moment finally arrived in 1979, with Thatcher's election. If history repeats, which it rarely does exactly, we should expect the Unchaining of Britannia to commence in 2019.</p> <p>In the meantime, after half a decade, already, of widespread pay freezes and anxiety, and with Labour under Ed Miliband quietly accepting that they will next hold power in hard times too \u2013 \"There is a new world out there,\" the much-tipped young Labour backbencher Stella Creasy recently told this paper, \"in the next [government] spending review absolutely everything should be on the table\" \u2013 the toughening-up of Britain is arguably well underway.</p> <p>Are we a nation of idlers? I'm not sure we were completely complacent even during the fat years of the 90s. Here is Tony Blair at the 1999 Labour conference: \"All around us the challenge of change ... technological revolution ... global finance and communications ... These forces ... wait for no one and no nation.\" Perhaps it is the fate of all old nations to be told to pull their socks up by politicians.</p>",
  "<p><sup>\"</sup>Don't be afraid to go too slowly,\" whispers a figure in a yellow poncho, treading deliberately by my side until I move at the correct speed. Ahead of me, under a vast sky, I can see eight other people, evenly spaced, pacing like slow-motion zombies across the fields.</p> <p>This strange universe is called <a href=\"http://www.nnfestival.org.uk/festival/outdoor/walking\" title=\"\">Walking</a>, and it has been created by the director and artist <a href=\"http://robertwilson.com/\" title=\"\">Robert Wilson</a>, in collaboration with the Dutch artists <a href=\"http://www.nnfestival.org.uk/walking/walking_generic/theun-mosk-and-boukje-schweigman\" title=\"\">Theun Mosk and Boukje Schweigman</a>. Part meditation, part immersive theatre, it is a three-hour walk in which participants are instructed to move slowly across a remote slice of Norfolk countryside, their encounters with a series of dramatic sound installations timed to the second by yellow-cloaked guides called \"angels\".</p> <p>Wilson has touched down fleetingly at a pub in Norfolk, en route from New York to Ireland, to talk about Walking \u2013 although I am not anticipating much of an explanation. Previous interviews note his tendency to avoid eye contact, and to sketch explanations on paper rather than verbalise them; he is given to gnomic paradoxes such as: \"You think, 'What is the wrong thing to do?' and then do that.\" Now 70, Wilson is perhaps best known for Einstein on the Beach, his five-hour, interval-free <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/apr/23/how-we-made-einstein-on-the-beach\" title=\"\">collaboration with composer Philip Glass</a> that made both men famous in 1976. His experimental pieces are notoriously uncompromising: Deafman Glance was a seven-hour, silent opera inspired by the deaf-mute child Wilson adopted in 1967 when he was 27.</p> <p>Dressed more like a banker than an artist, Wilson is tall and intimidating, and spends 20 minutes describing Walking with pencil on pad. But he is also surprisingly jolly and generous. The piece, he explains, was first created for a Dutch festival but has been reimagined for the north Norfolk coast. These fields, woods, water meadows and sand dunes perfectly match Wilson's desire to create an immersive experience undisturbed by the built environment \u2013 apart from his own constructions. \"I wanted nature, the landscape, to predominate,\" he says.</p> <p>Norfolk reminds Wilson of his own childhood in Waco, Texas: \"I always thought of the English landscape as being English gardens. Here, it's so beautiful to see nature in the raw,\" he says. Given the miserable-sounding upbringing he endured, it is surprising he acknowledges any creative debt to the state: the gay son of a father who viewed his sexuality as an illness to be cured, Wilson had a speech impediment and was incarcerated after a suicide attempt. But \"the landscape of Texas is in all my work,\" he says. \"It's that light, it's that sky.\"</p> <p>Slowness is another motif Wilson returns to, with Walking's snail's pace sternly enforced by the angels. \"You walk at a much slower pace than you normally would, so your perceptions are different. If we listen ...\" He pauses for a long 20 seconds, during which there is the sound of a child's wail and a clink of cutlery. \"That sequence of sounds will never happen again. Never. The only thing that's constant is change.\" In a woodland glade, walkers recuperate to ethereal choral music. This turns out to be a recording of crickets slowed down by Tom Waits, an approximation of what they might sound like if they lived as long as humans. \"What you hear is like human voices, or choirs from heaven,\" Wilson says.</p> <p>This is the latest of many collaborations with Waits. Wilson \u2013 a&#xa0;great polymath \u2013 has worked with everyone from Marina Abramovic to Allen Ginsberg, William S Burroughs to Lou Reed. Wilson met Samuel Beckett several times and although they never worked together, he is heading to <a href=\"http://festival.london2012.com/events/9000962123\" title=\"\">Enniskillen this week to perform Krapp's Last Tape</a>, which Beckett wrote for a 70-year-old man. He is also planning a production of Peter Pan with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/06/cocorosie-meltdown-review\" title=\"\">CocoRosie, the half-Cherokee folk singing sisters</a>. He adds: \"I want to work with Jay-Z. I went to see him the other day. But CocoRosie, they are great.\" The sisters recently stayed with him at the <a href=\"http://watermillcenter.org/about\" title=\"\">Watermill</a>, the arts centre he founded on Long Island 20 years ago, and which he considers home. What would he do with Jay-Z? \"Oh, I don't know,\" he says. This particular collaboration is definitely not up for discussion.</p> <p>Critics and participants will search for meaning in Walking, and in a moment of weakness Wilson likens it to a human being. The first installation, which requires walkers to stand in a circle around a bottomless conical shape with an amplified groan playing around them, is heavy, like feet; the walking part is the body; and the final installation, a futuristic mud cone, is the mysterious temple of the mind.</p> <p>Mostly, however, Wilson does not like his art to have explicit meanings. \"If I see a sunset, it doesn't have to tell me a story, it's something I experience, and that's what's most important here. Susan Sontag said to experience something is a way of thinking. We don't have to imply meaning. This piece is about experiencing.\"</p> <p>Britain and the US, he thinks, are too set on the idea of storytelling in theatre. \"I go to one Broadway show every year and they are all the same, whether it's Angels in America or Death of a Salesman. I started looking at my watch during Peter Pan. It's never, never, longer than 25 seconds that the audience doesn't <em>have</em> to react. 'Do you understand what I'm saying? Do you get it?' And after a while you don't get anything! It's OK to get lost!\" he hollers.</p> <p>The prophet not being recognised by his own is a recurring theme for Wilson, whose abstract works have been rapturously received in continental Europe, less so in the US. His father, he says, never understood him. \"Poor man. The first time he saw my work, he said, 'Son, not only is this sick, it's abnormal.'\" (Wilson adopts a thick Texan drawl.) When he lost $250,000 staging Einstein on the Beach at the Metropolitan opera in New York, his father told him, \"'I didn't think you were smart enough to be able to lose $250,000.' I said, 'Dad, it wasn't easy, it was a lot of work.'\"</p> <p>Since 1999, Wilson has premiered nine theatrical works in Berlin; his last commission in the US was 21 years ago. \"My tax dollar, which goes to <a href=\"http://www.nysca.org/\" title=\"\">New York State Council on the Arts</a>, is by and large only spent to fund people from the state of New York! And you want to be the cultural capital of the world?\" he says. \"New York is very provincial. They're very cut-off, they don't have an awareness of so much that is going on in the world.\"</p> <p>Wilson can rage like an artist who never got his due; but he can also laugh at his commercial failures. On the third night of his 12-hour performance piece The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin, which premiered in Copenhagen in 1973, the 128-strong cast realised that by 2am there was no one left in the audience. Even Wilson's idea of putting spare cast members into the empty seats couldn't prevent it from closing that same night. When his A&#xa0;Letter for Queen Victoria was shown on Broadway in 1975, a \"little blue-haired lady from New Jersey\" walked out after half an hour, telling the usher: \"Honey, I know it's a turkey, but what does it mean?\" When Wilson repeated the story to his sister, she said: \"I don't know how you get away with all of that.\" \"Well, sometimes you don't,\" he says, with the glee of a man who has got away with plenty.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/power-women/list/\" title=\"\">Forbes magazine's annual list of the 100 most powerful women on the planet</a> is long on politicians, philanthropists and entertainers, but short on influential Britons, with just the Queen and JK Rowling making this year's cut.</p> <p>Leading the list for the second year running is the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, followed by the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, and Melinda Gates, co-chair of the foundation that bears her name and that of her husband, Bill.</p> <p>The magazine \u2013 which refers to Merkel as the \"'Iron Lady' of Europe and the lead player in the eurozone economic drama that continues to threaten global markets\" \u2014 notes her embracing of the internet, green credentials and high public approval ratings in the run-up to next year's general election.</p> <p>Clinton, meanwhile is praised for her commitment to her job \u2013 \"this year alone she's travelled to 42 countries\" \u2013 her handling of the WikiLeaks cable crisis, and her uncompromising attitude.</p> <p>\"In November, [Clinton] urged Syrian President Bashar Assad to hand over his power and leave his country, and recently warned North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to chart a different course than his militant father,\" says Forbes. The magazine said supporters were still hopeful of Clinton making a presidential bid, despite her stated determination to move out of public life at the end of the year.</p> <p>Rousseff earns her place for her ambitious plans and programmes \"aimed at eradicating dire poverty and increasing access to education, medical care and sanitation services to those in need by 2014\". The politician, whose popularity stood at 77% two months ago, tells the magazine: \"What I want my legacy to be is this country to be increasing middle class, to be highly competitive and highly educated.\"</p> <p>Next up is Gates, who has used her money and influence to challenge the Vatican over its position on birth control.</p> <p>The first lady of the US comes in seventh place on the list, below Jill Abramson, executive editor of the New York Times, and Sonia Gandhi, the longest serving president of the Indian National Congress party.</p> <p>\"More popular than her husband in this important election year, Michelle Obama's positive approval ratings register at 66%,\" says Forbes. \"The first lady keeps a high profile with her mission to end childhood obesity, her commitment to military families and her stylish fashion picks.\"</p> <p>Hovering just outside the top 10 \u2013 whose remaining spots are claimed by Christine Lagarde of the IMF, the US homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, and Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook \u2013 is \"the Queen of Media\" Oprah Winfrey.</p> <p>She is far from the only cultural force to find Forbes recognition: Winfrey's friend Lady Gaga occupies 14th spot, a tribute to both her $52m earnings last year and her philanthropic work.</p> <p>Beyonce Knowles, \"actress, entrepreneur, musician\", is 18 places behind Gaga, but six places ahead of Jennifer L\u00f3pez and eight ahead of the Colombian singer-songwriter and philanthropist Shakira.</p> <p>The Queen is at No 26. \"She has been commemorating her 60th diamond Jubilee anniversary with parades, parties and by making peace throughout the realm,\" notes Forbes. \"In June she shook hands with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness during a visit to Northern Ireland that was seen as a symbol of significant easing of tensions in British-Irish relations. In lighter but similarly symbolic news the iconic clock tower of Britain's parliament building \u2013 widely, though incorrectly called Big Ben \u2013 was renamed in her honour this summer. It will be known as Elizabeth Tower.\"</p> <p>In the final quarter of the list, occupying 78th spot, is JK Rowling, soon to publish her \"first adult offering, a dark comedy titled The Casual Vacancy\". The billionaire author, says Forbes, shrewdly held onto the e-book rights of her Harry Potter novels, finally publishing them through the online Pottermore store this year.</p> <p>American-born Dame Marjorie Scardino, who runs Financial Times publisher Pearson, and who has British citizenship, is in the list at 86.</p> <p>Moira Forbes, president and publisher of ForbesWoman, said: \"These power women exert influence in very different ways and to very different ends, and all with very different impacts on the global community.</p> <p>\"So many of these women are in policy or political roles, and their influence ... is only growing so it's not surprising that someone like Merkel or Clinton would continue to be present on the list year to year.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's a warm summer's evening in Hanoi, and Nguyen Chu Hoa and her beau are zipping through the capital's tree-lined alleyways using Nguyen's favourite pair of wheels: an electric bicycle.</p> <p>\"Do I love my electric bike? Yes,\" exclaims the 21-year-old student. \"It is clean. It is fast. It is so easy.\"</p> <p>Long fashionable in China but slower to take off across south-east Asia, electric bike sales have recently surged in Vietnam, thanks in part to higher fuel prices. At Asama, a central Hanoi bike shop where posters of pretty Vietnamese girls on \"e-bikes\" adorn the walls, sales have risen fourfold in five years, says shop assistant Nguyen Cat Nhat.</p> <p>\"Our clients are mostly students \u2013 people who don't want to ride a bicycle or buy a car, or can't,\" he says. \"If we sell 10 electric bikes, five are for students, three are for older people, and two are for commuters. You have to be 18 to get a licence for a motorbike, so an electric bicycle is the easiest way for high-school students to get to and from class.\"</p> <p>And yet, the e-bike still has a long way to go to oust the motorbike as Vietnam's favoured form of two-wheeled transport. Research has shown that lack of government incentive, coupled with so-called \"image problems\" such as poor performance and low quality, have kept sales significantly lower than in China, which produced nearly 31m e-bikes last year and provides the bulk of e-bikes for sale in Vietnam.</p> <p>As a result, the e-bike often serves as a temporary stepping stone, admits Nguyen: \"Our clients usually replace it with a motorcycle when they get the money.\"</p> <p>It is proving tough to create a green cycle-conscious culture in Vietnam, says Barcelona native Guim Valls Teruel, founder of the <a href=\"www.thbc.vn\" title=\"\">Hanoi Bicycle Collective</a>, a cafe-cum-bike shop specialising in fixed-speed, vintage Peugeot and electric bicycles. \"When I opened the shop, the whole neighbourhood was looking at me like, 'What is this guy doing? No one buys bicycles anymore, they only buy motorbikes and cars,' \" says Teruel, who recently e-biked from China to Spain and opened the shop in Hanoi's fashionable West Lake this year. \"Here, people who ride bicycles are considered poor. It's a lower-class form of transport because as soon as anyone makes any money, they buy a motorbike. And if they make a little bit more, then they buy a car.\"</p> <p>It used to be said the bicycle determined not only the success of a household in Vietnam, but the nation as a whole. North Vietnamese and Viet Cong soldiers pedalled so many supplies along the Ho Chi Minh Trail that a New York Times journalist reportedly told a US Senate committee: \"I literally believe that without bikes, they'd have to get out of the war.\"</p> <p>Nearly 40 years on, Vietnam shines as an Asian tiger of global economic textbooks. Its thriving middle class, booming economy and steady industry have resulted in a purchasing power noted most simply by the 33m motorbikes swarming the streets, alleys and lanes. Hanoi recently ordered the cyclo, the iconic rickshaw, to operate only at certain times to limit traffic.</p> <p>Perhaps ironically, it is the millions of visitors to Vietnam every year who seem to be the keenest cyclists. \"The natural scenery of the nation is best seen by bicycle,\" says Ngo Trong Huy of Vietnam Bike Tours, a Saigon company catering mainly to foreigners. \"But we don't see many [Vietnamese] riding bicycles now. I think we will in the next decade, when each family has a car. Then I expect Vietnamese to become our primary clientele.\"</p> <p>Teruel says the only way to get Vietnamese once again interested in bicycles is to associate them with what matters most: continued economic development. \"One guy in Ho Chi Minh City actually told me, 'The problem with electric bicycles is you'll never get a girlfriend,' \" Teruel says. \"The electric bicycle costs [less or] about the same as a motorbike, but it needs to be associated with sports, status or speed.\"</p> <p>That most Vietnamese wedding portraits still snap the couple next to a bicycle shows how ingrained the bicycle is in the national culture. But today they may evoke a greater sense of nostalgia than the promise of use. As Nguyen Chu Hoa's boyfriend said: \"Hoa says she loves her electric bike, but all she wants is a motorbike like mine. She talks about it all the time.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Esmer Golluoglu is a pseudonym</em></p>",

  "<p>The Yugoslav/Serbian chess grandmaster Svetozar Gligoric, who has died aged 89, was a former world top 10 player, an eloquent writer and commentator, and a widely liked and admired personality who played a key role in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,2243089,00.html\" title=\"\">Bobby Fischer</a>'s matches with Boris Spassky.</p> <p>He was three times a world title candidate and led the Yugoslav team at the international chess Olympiad to five silver medals, behind the USSR, and to gold in 1950, when the Soviet Union did not compete. In 1958, when the 15-year-old Fischer came to Europe, Gligoric befriended him, and later recounted how Fischer had quizzed him about a critical opening position in the Sicilian Defence. Unsuspecting, Gligoric told all he knew. A few weeks later, they were paired in the final round of the interzonal tournament, reached the key position, and Fischer promptly unleashed a strong novelty. Gligoric managed to hold on for a draw, and both qualified for the candidates tournament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395040093\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345571619992/Gligoric-2-001.jpg\" alt=\"Gligoric 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gligoric v Joe Rosenstein, Chicago 1963. How did Gligoric (White, to play) win in style? Solution below. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gligoric's best moment as an author came at the 1972 match in Reykjavik between Fischer and Spassky, which sparked a global chess boom. His move-by-move paperback The Chess Match of the Century was published within a few days of Fischer becoming world champion, and sold close to half a million copies. He stayed friends with the American, and helped persuade him out of retirement for his 1992 rematch with Spassky.</p> <p>His other lifelong interest was music. Gligoric was one of the few Yugoslavs able to travel freely in the early 1950s, and he and the master Nikola Karaklajic, a disc jockey with Radio Belgrade, brought home records and popularised western culture and music.</p> <p>Gligoric was born in Belgrade. His family was poor, and both his parents died young, but he learnt chess at 11, making his own set from wine corks, and soon displayed exceptional talent. At 15, he was Belgrade champion. Then came the second world war, when he spent four years with Tito's partisans and became a captain.</p> <p>His career resumed in style when he won the Warsaw 1947 tournament ahead of two top USSR players, then blossomed with Olympiad gold at Dubrovnik 1950. In the 1950s, when Soviet chess domination was at its zenith, Gligoric was among a handful who posed a threat, particularly in individual games. He won seven times against Tigran Petrosian and five times against <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/mar/28/vasily-smyslov-obituary\" title=\"\">Vasily Smyslov</a> when these world champions were at their peaks, while at the 1958 Munich Olympiad, where he won the top board gold medal, the world champion Mikhail Botvinnik and Smyslov sat out the USSR v Yugoslavia match rather than play him.</p> <p>The question is why Gligoric did not get closer to the world championship than his shared fifth place with Fischer in the 1959 candidates tournament. One reason is that most great players improve fast in their early 20s, whereas Gligoric's career was slowed by the war. Critically, too, one of his few failures was in the 1948 interzonal which, given a four-year qualifying cycle, meant that he did not become a candidate until he was already 30 years old. And although he had a strong openings repertoire, it was a shade too predictable at the highest level, helping the Soviet grandmasters to prepare for him.</p> <p>Gligoric was fluent in several languages, spoke excellent English and played frequently in the UK. He won the annual Hastings Premier five times, but unlike Fischer he was no maximalist. His favourite opening weapons with Black were the combative King's Indian and Sicilian, so when he deviated from these it was often a pacific signal. The first time I played him at Hastings, he was already coasting to victory, selected an innocuous plan, and readily agreed a 16-move draw. But at our final meeting a decade later he wanted to win, whipped out the Sicilian and crushed me with an energetic attack.</p> <p>Though the Reykjavik paperback had by far the largest sale of Gligoric's books, his I Play Against Pieces was the most influential. Its title carried the message that chess should be a battle of logic and a struggle between ideas rather than a psychological and personal battle.</p> <p>He was a regular contributor to US magazines, where his lucid Game of the Month column acted as a masterclass tutorial in opening trends for keen amateurs. There are \"Gligoric systems\" in three major openings, but one of his few gripes was that a deep system he introduced in the King's Indian at a tournament in Argentina was not named after him but became the \"Mar del Plata variation\".</p> <p>Gligoric was respected throughout the chess world for his gentlemanly manner, grace and charm. In 1958 he was voted Yugoslavia's sportsman of the year, and in 1978 he only narrowly failed in a bid to become head of the world chess body Fide. He was chief arbiter of the marathon 1984-85 world title match between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov.</p> <p>When Fischer made his 1992 comeback for a rematch with Spassky, he insisted that Gligoric be present at the negotiations. The American was fearful he would be rusty, so asked his friend to play a secret 10-game training match, which Fischer won narrowly.</p> <p>After retiring from competitive chess, Gligoric took up music seriously in his 80s. Last year he released an album with 12 compositions in various genres including blues, jazz, ballads and rap, performed by an orchestra. He compared music to chess: \"Each note is a move and from these elements you create your own architecture with known rules.\"</p> <p>Gligoric's wife of 47 years, Danica, died in 1994.</p> <p>\u2022 Svetozar Gligoric, chess player, born 2 February 1923; died 14 August 2012</p> <p>Chess solution: Qxe7+!

There are patches of milky blue sky beyond the city skyline to the north, and the forecast is rain free. </p> <p>Middlesex have been out on the ground warming up since just after 9.30am but there has been no sign of Warwickshire. Either the 5.1 overs of play last night left them exceptionally confident \u2013 and Ian Westwood, who has 261 runs from his last four Championship innings, looked in rare touch \u2013 or they are in the indoor school facing the bowling machine. </p> <p>The visitors will be keen to see the ball swing this morning otherwise an even greater burden will fall on the shoulders of their 21-year-old left-arm spinner, Ravi Patel, the Loughborough student from Eastcote Cricket Club in the Middlesex County league who is making his Championship debut here. Should he have any tricks up his sleeve \u2013 a carrom ball, say \u2013 it will no doubt help that his club-mate, Adam Rossington, is behind the stumps.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>11.49am: Marcus Trescothick has gone on to his 50th first-class century here, thanks to a slight misfield by his opposite number Ed Joyce, the Sussex captain, <em>writes Paul Weaver</em>. </p> <p>It came off 167 balls, with 18 fours, and marked a welcome return to championship form after a diffident comeback \u2013 he had scored just 28 in three innings after being out for three months with an ankle injury. </p> <p>Top players, though, are rarely off form for long, and there has been some imperious driving from the former England opener. The Sussex players were less than effusive with their applause, but then they seemed convinced that Monty Panesar had snaffled him yesterday, when he had made 60. </p> <p>Somerset are 199 for three and could be on for a decent total here, and with the pitch turning that could be ominous for Sussex. </p> <p>On my way here I bumped into Scott Styris, the New Zealand all-rounder, in the hotel. He's not playing in this match but is joining up with his team-mates before the T20 finals on Saturday, a reminder that Sussex have other fish to fry. Somerset too.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>12.18pm: Durham added a further 19 runs this morning before losing their final wicket - Scott Borthwick pinned lbw by a full bunger from Chris Russell - to be dismissed for 234, a lead of 114, <em>writes Richard Gibson</em>. </p> <p>Number 11 Chris Rushworth gave it some long handle on the second morning, launching a delivery from Gareth Andrew over long-on and into the supporters gathered at the front of the County Durham Stand. Rushworth finished unbeaten on 24 but it has been his emergence with the ball in the second half of the season that has been pivotal in Durham winning three consecutive matches and mounting a challenge for Division One prize money. <br>Sunderland-raised Rushworth would be the north-east county's emerging player of the season, and those inclined to vote for the LV County Championship - Breakthrough Player of the Year Award can do so <a href=\"http://www.lv.com/aboutus/sponsorship/lv-county-championship/award-winning-performances/\">over here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>12.49pm: It is doubtful whether any aspirant coaches within the ECB system consult the hallowed MCC Coaching Manual these days, much less impose its occasionally dubious verities on their charges, for people now realize that technique, while based on certain sound principles (sound at the linguistic level, at least), is not about absolutes, <em>writes Scott Oliver</em>. </p> <p>Rather, it needs to be understood as a hand-to-hand combat of energies \u2013 always factoring in the continuous variation of pitch and overhead conditions \u2013 whereby the singular style and skill-set of each player presents for their direct adversary what philosophers like to call a \"problematic\", a puzzle.<br> This has been amply illustrated at Edgbaston this morning where the squat left-handed orthodoxy of Ian Westwood and the upright right-handed idiosyncrasies of Varun Chopra have had the upper hand, managing to 'solve' the distinct problems posed by the skiddy medium pace of Tim Murtagh and the tall, lively Toby Roland-Jones. Chopra's technique involves several moving parts. Standing tall at the crease, with a high, straight-armed backlift that is definitely Made in Essex (more Ronnie Irani than Graham Gooch, mind), his trigger movement takes his back foot well outside off stump, his front pad on the line of off, so that he often hides all three stumps, tempting the bowler to attack the castle yet the line of his shoulders remaining open enough for him to work the ball through mid on, mid-wicket without playing around his front leg. One would imagine that, when out of form, synchronisation might be an issue; without having looked from side-on, there are suggestions that the amount of movement means not only is he not always playing from a stable base, but that his weight distribution might occasionally be too far over his back foot, too much in the first part of his trigger movement. </p> <p>I would suggest that, as for all players who pick their bats up high, a sharp yorker first up might be worthwhile. Still, an England Lions appearance last week and approaching 750 Championship runs at over 40 suggest that his game is in reasonable order.<br> Westwood, meanwhile, is a figure of stillness and compaction. The problematic he poses for bowlers concerns his height and, consequently, their length. On the flipside, Roland-Jones' bounce from this firm surface has discomfited him on more than one occasion \u2013 a short ball being jabbed from the splice to the safety of a vacant leg gully region and a few balls of good length hitting him amidships. However, when his defence has enticed the bowler to search for a fuller length, he has been good enough to transfer his weight and drive crisply and powerfully in the arc from cover to mid on. It has been an intriguing battle. Warwickshire are 103 for 0 from 28 overs.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>1.08pm: Somerset have collapsed in the hour and a bit before lunch, as the ball has turned as terminally as a coffin screw, <em>writes Paul Weaver</em>. </p> <p>Jos Buttler, who I think had a mind to target the bowling of Monty Panesar, hit him high and straight \u2013 straight into the hands of Steve Magoffin at long-off, that is. </p> <p>That was 199 for four and it became 213 for five eight overs later, when Alex Barrow was caught at short-leg, also off Panesar. </p> <p>But the biggest wicket of all was taken by the Sussex part-time spinner, Chris Nash, who had Trescothick caught behind as the batsman attempted to take his bat away; 241 for six in the 80th and Tresco had made 123. </p> <p>Then Peter Trego was bowled by Panesar as he shaped to cut. The ball kept worryingly low, though. And in the last over before lunch Abdur Rehman was lbw to Nash. </p> <p>This could be a cracker of a match if yesterday's bad weather stays away. And if it stays fine there may not be much play on Friday.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>1.38pm: We have just witnessed the longest spell without a wicket in the match here at Chester-le-Street which means that Worcestershire, who took lunch on 64 without loss after 26 overs, are 50 runs behind hosts Durham, <em>writes Richard Gibson</em>. </p> <p>New-ball duo Graham Onions and Chris Rushworth, the dukes of hazard in the first innings, have been a pale imitation of their former selves despite the surface still being receptive to seam movement. Their next spells could be key to how this match unfolds. </p> <p>Australian Phil Hughes has punished anything loose in a continuation of his rich form across all three formats \u2013 he is top scorer in the Friends Life t20 with 402 runs and second in the Clydesdale Bank 40 with 498, statistics that suggest it is an anomaly that he is yet to feature for Australia outside of Test cricket - and his ability to hit the ball in strange areas could prove increasingly problematic if he gets 'in' again after lunch. The 23-year-old resumes on 46 with Worcestershire captain Daryl Mitchell 16 not out.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>2.48pm: Warwickshire have added 50 at a run-a-minute since lunch, during which time Westwood and Chopra have given the visitors a lesson in how to bat on this true surface in bringing up milestones in contrasting fashion, <em>writes Scott Oliver</em>. The latter reached his 50 from 113 balls with just four boundaries, two of which were fortunate, while the diminutive Moseley man (the suburb of Birmingham, not the inter-war fascist sympathiser) went to three figures from 148 balls with his seventeenth four. Five of these boundaries came from his first dozen balls after lunch, four courtesy of leg-stump half-volleys (three from Murtagh's first four balls to him) as whatever pep-talk Chris Rogers offered his troops evaporated faster than a puddle in the Pietermaritzburg sun. <br> Chopra has just slashed Berg to gully, however, where Robson held on to a sharp catch, but the example was not followed by Rogers who spilled a scoreless Porterfield in the following over, bowled by Crook. At 182 for 1 with 53 overs left in the day and a long Bears batting line-up, the visitors can ill afford such lapses.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>3.34pm: Having produced the best bowling figures of his career, Panesar is now getting ready to pad up. Well, not quite, but it won't be too long, <em>suspects Paul Weaver</em>. </p> <p>Somerset lost their last two wickets without addition after lunch, and Monty grabbed them both. He had the on-loan Sajid Mahmood, a potentially dangerous late-order hitter, caught at short-leg for a blob and then had Gary Keedy caught behind for another nothing. Somerset, 247 all out, will be disappointed after looking good for 300 plus. </p> <p>Sussex, the best one-day side in the country who still have hopes of pinching the championship as well \u2013 what would be their fourth title in ten seasons \u2013 made a bright start. </p> <p>They went off at a run a ball before Nash was caught at short midwicket, and was soon followed by opening partner Ed Joyce, who was caught behind.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>4.38pm: This match is evenly poised at tea on the second day, with Worcestershire effectively 68 for two in their second innings, <em>writes Richard Gibson at the Riverside</em>. Having begun 114 runs in arrears, Australian Phillip Hughes' second hundred in the County Championship this season has redressed the balance of power. The 23-year-old eventually nicked one, chasing a wide delivery from Ben Stokes, after contributing 104 in an opening stand of 148 with captain Daryl Mitchell, who succumbed four overs later with a tame steer to gully off the same bowler. </p> <p>Meanwhile, James Cameron, the man Hughes replaced for this match after missing last week's draw with Lancashire, has announced his retirement from first-class cricket at the age of 26 to pursue a career in financial services. The Zimbabwe-born player's one hundred for the county came in crucial circumstances - his 105 against Sussex in 2010 helping clinch promotion to the top-flight. The 2012 season has proved a struggle, however, with just 300 runs spanning his 11 Division One outings. </p> <p>\"It has been an extremely difficult decision, but after much discussion with both family and close friends, I feel that it is in my best long-term interests going forward.,\" Cameron said. \"I am sad to be leaving cricket and Worcester, as I have made many friends at the club, and we have achieved some very good things on the field over the last few years. I especially thank Steve Rhodes and Worcestershire for the opportunity that they have given me. It is a special club and I will always be very proud of my association with Worcestershire.\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>5.18pm: It's been a different game since Phillip Hughes was dismissed for 104, his second County Championship hundred of the season, <em>writes Richard Gibson</em>. Just as in the first innings, and indeed as they did in the corresponding fixture last season, Worcestershire have imploded, slipping from 148 without loss to 217 for seven. Hughes chased one to present wicketkeeper Phil Mustard with a straightforward chance, and several other injudicious strokes have accounted for his colleagues. </p> <p>The only absolved of blame thus far is Moeen Ali, who was brilliantly caught at short leg by Will Smith, from an inside edge, to double leg-spinner Scott Borthwick's wicket tally.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>5.20pm: Murray Goodwin once scored an unbeaten 344 for Sussex here, a county record, and it was only three years ago,<em> writes Paul Weaver</em>. </p> <p>Even last season he topped the side's championship averages with 1,372 runs at 52 a knock, a reminder that after Mushtaq Ahmed he was the team's most important player when they won three championship titles in five years. </p> <p>A few years ago there was no player you would rather have in your county batting line-up, unless it was Mark Ramprakash. </p> <p>Those days, sadly, appear to have gone as he prepares for his 40th birthday later this year. His 20 championship innings have brought him just 267 runs at 14.05. He has passed 20 just three times, with one, solitary fifty. </p> <p>He had made just 17 here yesterday before Marcus Trescothick took a juggling catch at slip off Abdur Rehman to send him on his way. </p> <p>Sussex were 68 for three then, and that became106 for four when Michael Yardy was lbw to Steve Kirby for a battling 18. The longer this match goes on the better Trescothick's century looks. It just might have been a match-winner, with Sussex still a distance behind Somerset's 247.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>5.34pm: Middlesex have done well to stay in the game at Edgbaston, <em>writes Scott Oliver</em>. This is due in no small part to a brace of wickets for the relatively innocuous 'phantom seamers' of Neil Dexter, who, after his century yesterday, is having a fine match.<br> First to fall was Ian Westwood, chipping to mid off having made 120, a second hundred in four Championship innings. His crestfallen reaction indicated not only that there are still plenty more runs in this pitch, but also that he may have pushed the door slightly ajar for the visitors. He was followed shortly after tea by Darren Maddy, slashing to gully for 16 to continue a pretty wretched run of form (his last score above 50 was on April 21). The new ball was taken as soon as it became available, 10 overs after tea, with Warwickshire at 265 for 4. It has already done its job, too, as the impressive Toby Roland-Jones nicked off both Ricky Clarke and Tim Ambrose, the former to a ball that got big on him as he tried to use his height to kill the bounce from an in-between length, the latter pushing forward in defence to another delivery that zipped off the pitch and seamed away slightly. Ian Blackwell then walked out for his maiden Warwickshire innings to a ripple of applause but has just become the third victim of Roland-Jones' spell, lbw to a ball that may have pitched a fraction outside leg. Keith Barker \u2013 no mug with the bat, if short of form \u2013 needs to dig in and help Jim Troughton, who has just gone to 50 from 106 balls (6 fours, 1 six), extend the lead to something meaningful. Having taken seven wickets for 114 runs since breaking the opening partnership at 175, Middlesex will hope to polish things off in the session's thirteen remaining overs.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>6.10pm: Slightly farcical scenes at Edgbaston where \u2013 with the almost clockwork timing of a tropical weather system \u2013 a rain cloud has, for the second day running, blown in over the back of the new stand and taken the players from the field, <em>writes Scott Oliver</em>.<br> Before it dropped its load, the umpires had conferred about the light and were promptly heckled by the members: \"Get on with it!\" They conferred for a second time, yet still they stayed on. Predictably, the next ball produced a wicket, Troughton edging Murtagh to second slip for an even 50, at which point there was a loud cry of rebuke for the umpires for having stopped out there. The skipper was not best pleased. The 10-minute downpour was trailed in from the south by glorious sunshine but the umpires have squelched out to the square and decided that that is that for the day. No members could be heard barracking them. Warwickshire are 283 for 8 and lead by just six runs.</p>",

  "<p>Though one should never feel sympathy for criminals, for at root, their trade is misery, it is easy to view <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/22/asil-nadir-guilty-six-theft-charges\" title=\"\">the fall of Asil Nadir and the end of his incredible story</a> with a pang of nostalgia. The people who plunder large corporations these days seem to be a charmless, hachet-faced lot. Asil Nadir always seemed a little different \u2013 and then there was the bizarre troupe of characters that gravitated towards him.</p> <p>Think first of all of those who lost money to help him live the high life, because there is no such thing as a victimless crime, and Nadir siphoned millions from institutions and blameless individuals to pay off his debts.</p> <p>But think then about the way it all played out. This was crime as soap opera.</p> <p>Think of Peter Dimond, the stick-thin, very English character, whose belief in Nadir was such that he <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/255831.stm\" title=\"\">willingly turned his life on its head by agreeing to fly the tycoon out of the country</a> to Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus \u2013 out of the reach of the British authorities \u2013 in 1993. He was jailed for two years in 1999. Luckily for him, that sentence was overturned when his lawyers established that \u2013 technically \u2013 Nadir was not on bail when he left the country. He spent many years in exile at one of Nadir's hotels. He never doubted his friend's integrity, he told reporters. Nadir just needed time to prepare his defence. Dimond was like a supporting character in a military drama starring Kenneth More.</p> <p>Think of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/nasir-aide-is-jailed-over-stolen--pounds-400000-1343535.html\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Forsyth</a>, the home counties grandmother with the fur and the jewels and the cut-glass accent. The former head of Nadir's personal management company, she was jailed for five years in 1996 for allegedly handling stolen money and spent 10 months in jail but overturned the verdict the following year. The cost of the case against her was estimated at \u00a31m. Warm, persuasive, with the mannerisms of a Conservative party chair from Surrey, she refused to entertain any suggestion of wrongdoing on Nadir's part. She even wrote a labour-of-love book on the crimes done to him: <a href=\"http://www.alibris.co.uk/search/books/isbn/9781856851138\" title=\"\">Who Killed Polly Peck?</a></p> <p>Think too of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/24/newsid_2519000/2519201.stm\" title=\"\">Michael Mates</a>, the former Tory Northern Ireland minister, <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/localgovernment/2012/05/michael-mates-seeks-nomination-for-hampshire-police-commissioner.html\" title=\"\">now a Tory candidate for crime commissioner in Hampshire</a>. He was highly respected but once Nadir fled Britain he suffered a blow from which his career never recovered. \"Don't let the buggers get you down\" was the message inscribed onto the back of a watch he sent to Nadir, a Tory donor to the tune of \u00a3500,000. Disclosure of that fact proved lethal, as did the leaking of a letter he sent to the attorney general complaining about how Nadir had been treated.</p> <p>And then of course there was the man himself, whose business and political connections in northern Cyprus allowed him to resume his life there with all the pomp of a returning prince. He owned hotels, factories, and a newspaper, and when he flew back there, he took the world's press with him. Good for him, good for the local economy. Most of the British journalists sent to find him ended up staying in his hotels like the Jasmine Court. Good for his employees; who brought into the courtyard a goat to be slaughtered and eaten to celebrate his homecoming. Good for Fleet Street. The Sun and the Star, seeing headlines at every turn, accosted the goat's owner with local currency and competed to buy it as a mascot for their readers.</p> <p>It was exhilarating for everyone, but it couldn't last. After four days being chased by the British journalists, Nadir \u2013 noting that the thrill had waned for them and for him \u2013 sought them out at the bar and bought them drinks.</p> <p>They would soon be gone; to be followed eventually by the politicians who made life on the island tolerable for him. His options for travel were limited, as were his abilities to trade and to obtain first-class medical treatment for heart and kidney ailments. He returned to Britain in 2010, having established that he would get bail and ebulliently citing his \"burning sense of injustice\". Those grievances will burn deeper now, a feeling that will be shared by all of the characters in the Nadir soap opera. Still, they have their memories.</p> <p>And they have their freedom, but not the leading player. He will spend long years in jail, and as he begins that new life he may reflect on a big miscalculation. Why did he return when he did? Well there was less political cover in northern Cyprus, and in a Turkey keen to recast itself as respecting enough of the international community to join the European Union.</p> <p>In Britain too, there was a political dimension. \"I'm hoping to get a fair trial, if this matter goes to trial, obviously,'' he said boarding the plane for London. ''That was not the case in the past.'' It was, he said, the \"right environment\" to challenge the charges levelled against him. A new government might not feel bound to follow the same hard line as governments before.</p> <p>But that was a mistake, proof perhaps that time away from Britain had dulled his perception. For whole the government changed, so too had the public's mood towards rich businessmen who live high on the hog on money derived from taxpayers and shareholders. Even the charming ones get a ducking.</p> <p>At the end of the day, his problem was not the government or the law officers. It was, in fact, a jury of our peers; weighing up the evidence and reflecting with their verdicts the mood of Britain 2012.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 August 2012. A production error meant that the original said, incorrectly, that Elizabeth Forsyth was awarded more than \u00a31m in damages when her conviction was overturned. In fact that was the estimated cost of the prosecution case brought against her; she did not receive compensation.</p>",

When the world's third largest private sector employer failed to come up with the goods, it prompted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/17/philip-hammond-light-privatisation-government?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">a long-overdue debate about outsourcing</a>. Defence secretary Philip Hammond noted that the private sector \u2013 in this case G4S \u2013 tried to do the job \"incredibly leanly with very little resilience\". That didn't work for defence or security. If you wanted safety, you needed high levels of back-up in case anything went wrong.</p> <p>Rival Carillion today came out fighting, saying major public sector customers in areas like defence and health had not been put off outsourcing workers by the G4S fiasco.</p> <p>The company, which maintains some UK railways, roads and military bases, said profits before tax shot up 68% in the first half. That includes the profits it has made from selling various PFI projects. Ignoring those, pre-tax profits ticked up 1% in the first half of this year, while revenues were down 12%. The company said stronger margins in its UK construction arm helped offset project delays in the Middle East. The joys of global diversification. The shares dipped 0.6% to 266p. G4S was 1.6% lower at 266p.</p> <p>Joe Brent at Liberum Capital was unimpressed by Carillion's first half and retained a sell recommendation on the stock. He said the company beat expectations in this half because margins in the UK construction business rose from 1.6% to 4.1%, but he is not sure the company can maintain those impressive levels.</p> <blockquote> Management argue that a 4%+ margin should be sustainable to 2014 given previous historical accounting, selective bidding (which also reduces bid costs) and cost reduction programmes. We would caution that it is totally out of kilter with the rest of the sector where 2% is a good margin. </blockquote> <p>Andy Brown at Panmure, on the other hand, retains his buy rating on the stock despite the results. He writes:</p> <blockquote> Unfortunately these are not great results from Carillion with a heavy construction services performance likely to raise questions over quality of earnings and a small increase in the [dividend per share]. That said full-year guidance has been maintained and the current valuation discounts a lot of bad news, trading on a price/earnings of 6x and dividend yield of 6.7%. </blockquote>",
  "<p>Barely two, possibly three, weeks to go before David Cameron's predicted reshuffle, the first such unforced exercise since the general election. Yet the Whitehall rumour mill is barely generating enough power to fuel a light bulb, apart from that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/20/kenneth-clarke-cabinet-post-reshuffle\" title=\"\">old chestnut about sacking Ken Clarke</a> and the newer ones about Mayor Boris sacking Dave or Dave sacking his chum, George.</p> <p>That's partly because reshuffles usually take place in July to give ex-ministers time away from Westminster to nurse their injured dignity and their successors time to find their way to the departmental loo without help and to start reading through the paperwork before MPs \u2013 including those who thought they should have been promoted \u2013 come back to torment them. In August there's not enough gossip to turn the mill wheel properly.</p> <p>In the British system reshuffles actually took place too frequently in July under both Tory and Labour governments. Ministers need time to get on top of their difficult issues and when they are, they are often moved too rapidly to do much good. Transport and trade (now BIS) are notoriously expendable cabinet posts; while lower down the pecking order, so Chris Mullin noted sorrowfully in his diaries, the Africa minister's post changed seven times under Tony Blair \u2013 and Blair was supposed to care about Africa.</p> <p>Now it's different in several ways. Reshuffles were once two-dimensional. A prime minister had a list of middle-aged white men, usually middle or upper middle-class chaps, and had to balance factions, personalities and ideology. Most of that still applies \u2013 though ideology is mostly at a discount nowadays \u2013 but it's at least four-dimensional. Cameron has the Lib Dems to consider \u2013 a very inhibiting fact \u2013 and he also has gender (women matter!) and possibly regions.</p> <p>There was no Eton quota 50 years ago either, let alone a posh-boy quota; there is now. So unfair when George Osborne's chums in the Bullingdon Club nicknamed him \"Oik\" because he only went to St Paul's, his local independent school in west London.</p> <p>So the inability to move the deckchairs very easily in a two-party, two-gender coalition has been an overall benefit. No, don't tell me about Cameron's urgent need to sack his chancellor. Those two really are \"all in this together\" and \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/21/economy-government-borrowing\" title=\"\">as Nick Watt and team report </a>\u2013 Osborne will be forced to modify Plan A this autumn under pressure from left, right and events. He will tweak it, but not abandon it. Cameron will stand by him.</p> <p>William Hague will therefore not get his job; he will stay \u2013 unhappily, I suspect \u2013 at the Foreign Office. You can't have much of a foreign policy if you don't have much money to spend: Clem Attlee's foreign secretary, the great Ernie Bevin, understood that when he asked the miners to dig more coal.</p> <p>Who else? It's a mug's game, really. The prime minister is on holiday and may even know by now roughly what he'd like to do, but not if he can do it: it was ever thus, as even Margaret Thatcher discovered when Minister A refused to move to Minister B's job or John Patten refused Northern Ireland. The rest of us can only gossip or tip X for Y's job, a notoriously counterproductive activity for MPs and reporters alike.</p> <p>\"The best I can do to help is attack you in print,\" is what I say to over-eager wannabes. Chris Grayling and Grant Shapps, two very eager mid-ranking ministers who are being tipped for promotion (again) would be wise to keep their heads down and stop cultivating hacks. \"The Great Mentioner\", as the US version is sometimes known in Washington, has ruined many a career.</p> <p>Will Ken Clarke finally be dropped over the side at 72? As a young barrister of very modest background \u2013 his dad was a watchmaker \u2013 the current justice secretary and lord chancellor was first elected in 1970 (at 29), became a government whip under Ted Heath two years later and has been (uniquely) in every Tory government for every day of their existence ever since. His only rival, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_George_Young,_6th_Baronet\" title=\"\">Sir George Young</a> (71), leader of the Commons, was briefly sacked by Thatcher for quasi-communism (he's a mildly liberal Etonian) before being brought back (also uniquely). The <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9484990/David-Camerons-reshuffle-headache-as-Ken-Clarke-digs-in.html\" title=\"\">Sunday Telegraph reported</a> Clarke as \"refusing\" to go, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/20/kenneth-clarke-cabinet-post-reshuffle\" title=\"\">the Guardian as \"fighting\" for his (and Young's) job</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19324097\" title=\"\">BBC reports </a>Clarke as languidly denying both while saying he wants to remain in post because he has an agenda to complete.</p> <p>Clarke's been round this course so often, it must be boring. In the rightwing's cooking pot, then rescued again at the last minute. Being confident enough and disinclined to piety to speak his mind, he gets into scrapes. His <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/may/18/david-cameron-urged-sack-kenneth-clarke-rape\" title=\"\">\"date rape\" remark</a> in 2011 has echoes of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/21/george-galloway-rape-comments-respect\" title=\"\">George Galloway's current furore</a>: you can see the distinction they're trying to make, that violent sexual assault by a burglar in the dead of night is quite a different experience. It's not an acceptable thing to say in the present social climate.</p> <h2>Jazz</h2> <p>But \"relaxed\" and \"fighting\" for his job can't be true? Of course they can. He wants to stay on but will find plenty to do \u2013 he has all that hinterland in jazz, bird-watching, cigars, cricket and books \u2013 if his time is up. Ditto George Young, though I suspect the other oldster around the coffin-shaped cabinet table, Vince Cable, a slightly less youthful 69, would be more upset to be sacked because he feels he represents a counterweight in government to the neo-liberal tendencies represented by so many younger colleagues, including Nicholas Clegg. For that reason alone I expect him to stay put.</p> <p>Interestingly all three oldies are on the leftish side of most Tory arguments. Does that reflect greater wisdom and experience ? Yes, says elderly me. No, reply the Desperate <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/author/danielhannan/\" title=\"Daniel Hannan: Telegraph blog\">Daniel Hannans </a>of this world, it's generational prejudice which is out of date. We'll see. How's the supply side economic recovery coming along, Dan?</p> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/government-and-opposition1/her-majestys-government/\" title=\"\">who exactly is in cabinet? </a>They are not household names or faces. Cheryl Gillan, the high-speed-train-bashing Welsh secretary, seems set to go, but that will barely be noticed even in Cardiff. Her likely successor, clever Maria Miller, grew up in Wales, but this may be a temporary post in transit upwards.</p> <p>Michael Gove? He'll stay put, he's the current star of the restless Tory pundits. Andrew Lansley? He's got to stay, he's the only one who understands his legislation. Jeremy Hunt? A tempting target after the Murdoch fiasco.</p> <p>Watching Hunt and Clarke give evidence on the same day to the Leveson inquiry I did the maths and realised that Ken has been an MP six times as long as Jezza. And boy, did it show. That's the real reason for keeping him in cabinet: it's the oldies who can say: \"Sorry, that won't work.\" But moving Hunt or sacking him will stir the hornet's nest too.</p> <p>I'd wager that Caroline Spelman (environment) is vulnerable, as is Lady Warsi (party chairman) except that she's a two-fer, both a woman and a Muslim one. Eric Pickles (communities and local government), anyone? No, he's more or less working-class and Yorkshire, every cabinet needs a sample. IDS? No, he cares even if he gets a lot wrong (like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/aug/21/councils-invest-food-banks-welfare-cuts\" title=\"\">food banks</a>). Andrew Mitchell (international development)? Would you notice? But he's a symbol of defanged Toryism and (I think) a Dave chum. Crafty Lord Strathclyde (Lords)? Good question, but it no longer matters, now they've junked Lords reform.</p> <p>Another thing. Since Osborne's in the doghouse his fingerprints can't be seen on this reshuffle, so his acolytes (Matt Hancock?) shouldn't waste too much time waiting by the phone. Even before Clegg offers his two pennies' worth, it's tricky, and cabinet government matters less than it did in an era of over-mighty quasi-presidential leadership. It should matter more, so a strong cabinet matters. Even Thatcher, who started so much of the rot, knew that and liked people who stood up to her (for a time, anyway).</p> <p>One last thought. Those Tory MPs elected in 2010 and especially 2005 are no longer the patient souls of yesterday: they want jobs and want them now; they have self-belief. If they see court favourites such as Hancock, Nick Boles or Claire Perry (unlucky enough to have a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2012/may/27/claire-perry-new-iron-lady\" title=\"\">recent Guardian profile</a>) getting a foot on the ministerial ladder they will be cross. The Cameroons have quite enough aggro on their party management plate without creating more.</p> <p>As for Boris Johnson, ex-MP Paul Goodman offers a witty account of the angel and devil wrestling for his soul <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/08/draft-urrrggghhh-aaaarrrggghhh-an-angel-an-devil-wrestle-for-boriss-soul.html\" title=\"\">here on the ConservativeHome website</a>.

  "<p>If you were to search for a torchbearer to represent the social enterprise movement, you would be hard put to find someone better than 27-year-old Jenny Dawson.</p> <p>The founder of chutney and jam company <a href=\"http://rubiesintherubble.com/\" title=\"\">Rubies in the Rubble</a> has that rare quality of integrating a sharp and ambitious business mind with a heart of gold.</p> <p>Dawson, who this week won the UK prize in a <a href=\"http://www.joinourcore.com/en/about\" title=\"\">European-wide social enterprise competition</a> run by ice-cream company Ben &amp; Jerry's, left her lucrative fund management job two years ago because she did not want to reach middle age and wonder why she had not concentrated on something she was passionate about.</p> <p>\"I had a realisation that if I was still there at 40, I would have lived a life for a wage rather than something I stood for and was proud of,\" she says.</p> <p>Her social enterprise is based on coming up with solutions to her twin concerns of food waste and finding employment opportunities for women who have fallen on hard times and need a helping hand to rebuild their lives.</p> <p>One of Dawson's innovations has been to recently open a commercial kitchen at the New Spitalfields fresh fruit and vegetable market in east London so that she can be on site to pick up high-quality produce that would otherwise go to landfill or compost because no buyers could be found. While she could take the produce for free, she feels it is important to pay a small price in order to build loyal relationships with the traders.</p> <p>Her ambition is to open similar kitchens at the two other wholesale fruit and vegetable markets in London as well as in cities such as Manchester, Bristol and Glasgow.</p> <p>She also hopes to diversify into soups and believes the model she is creating could be replicated in other countries.</p> <h2>Making the most of waste</h2> <p>The spark for creating the business came from reading about skip diving and freegans as well as reading the book Waste by Tristram Stuart, which exposed the scandal of 7.2 million tonnes of food and drink being thrown away every year in the UK, costing the country \u00a312bn.</p> <p>She followed this up early one morning by visiting New Covent Garden to see the problem with her own eyes.</p> <p>\"It was cold and dark but the market was bustling with really old-school traders and customers of every type from Chinese to Indians,\" she recalls. \"It felt like a real community with lots of laughter.</p> <p>\"Yet 100 metres away in the car park was an enormous tip and there was lots of produce that was still perfectly good. It felt a terrible shame that for example there were boxes of mange tout all the way from Kenya that were absolutely perfect but were not even making it into the shops.</p> <p>\"I realised it is a problem no one can be blamed for as it is down to an imbalance in supply and demand because it is unpredictable what people will want to buy on any given day.</p> <p>\"I was cycling home when the answer became obvious. The produce has to be preserved straight away. I was brought up on a farm in south-west Scotland and we were always making chutneys and jams.\"</p> <p>As she pondered on how she could turn this idea into a business, she recognised that she could integrate her other main passion in life; helping disadvantaged women.</p> <p>So far she has employed two people but hopes to scale this up once she secures major retail contracts. Ben &amp; Jerry's has offered to help her approach retailers such as Waitrose.</p> <p>\"After leaving the market that first day, I was also thinking about disadvantaged individuals in life and how sometimes they fall off the ladder and are then tainted by that history,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Inside we are all humans but depending on the jobs people have and clothes they wear, we judge who they are as people. Through employment, I want to help give people back their pride and self-belief.\"</p> <h2>A business head with charitable heart</h2> <p>Dawson had considered setting up her venture as a charity but feels NGOs have failed to find the solutions to society's problems and that socially responsible businesses have a greater chance of making a difference.</p> <p>\"Business has to be the new solution to social problems because by making a profit they can be sustainable, and by offering jobs they empower people,\" she says.</p> <p>\"I always believed you can run a company with a business head and a charity heart. I am ambitious and when I put my mind to something I want a result.</p> <p>\"I get excited by competition and having a product and seeing that succeed and if I am going to have a social and environmental impact, I need to sell a lot of jam and chutney.</p> <p>\"I want a business that thrives on many different levels, including ensuring that the people who work with me are getting a great experience and that as a team, we really enjoy its success.\"</p> <p>Dawson has followed in the footsteps of her father, who also quit a job in the City at an early age. He went on to set up a pig farm in Yorkshire before moving to near Castle Douglas where she grew up.</p> <p>She attended young naturalist camps run by her aunt and there were always debates about the environment around the kitchen table. Her love of food and dislike of waste came from the \"fantastic\" food and vegetable garden at home and the constant reminder to finish what was on her plate.</p> <p>\"My mother is known for her rhubarb chutney,\" says Dawson, \"and there was always something boiling away on the stove. She is also rather slapdash and was always changing the flavours depending on whatever was available at the time.\"</p> <p>Dawson's upbringing also instilled in her the attraction of a simple life and the fact that money does not buy happiness.</p> <p>\"Rubies in the Rubble has got to make a profit and I would like to be comfortable but when I was younger, I experienced a high-flying life, and it was not something I got any more happiness out of,\" she says.</p> <p>The chutneys and jams she sells at London's trendy Borough market are at a premium price and Dawson feels it is important that food waste is not something that is considered as second rate.</p> <p>\"At the moment, everything that addresses food waste in the UK is quite charity focused and it is associated with being a second-rate product,\" she says. \"I feel it is important for people to understand that much of this food is first class and there is no difference to what is being sold in the shops.\"</p> <p>While Dawson knows she can make only a tiny dent in the millions of tonnes of food that go to waste every year, she hopes her small contribution will support the growing movement of people who are seeking to address the problem.</p> <p>As a child, she was always aware how other families' fridges were often filled to bursting point and hopes that by purchasing her products and understanding the purpose behind them, consumers will start to move away from unnecessary consumption and put pressure on supermarkets to change their behaviour.</p> <p>While some people have voiced their concern that by using the word \"rubble\" in her brand name, she may put people off, Dawson is adamant to make a point.</p> <p>\"I want to make a statement that there are rubies in the rubble,\" she says. \"We are living in such a gluttonous society where we have so much we don't even need and throw away things well before the end of their natural life. We have become lazy as a result.\"</p> <p>The prize from Ben &amp; Jerry's, which will also be received by country winners in Denmark, Holland, Sweden and Ireland, is \u20ac10,000 plus six months' mentoring from the social enterprise network <a href=\"https://www.ashoka.org/\" title=\"\">Ashoka</a>. The social entrepreneurs' logos will also appear on a special tub of the company's ice cream next year.</p> <p>All of the competition's 14 short-listed candidates returned recently from a week in Uganda where they lived with farmers who supply Fairtrade organic vanilla to Ben &amp; Jerry's, as well as spending time with Ugandan counterparts who are seeking to start their own social businesses.</p> <h2>The challenges of social enterprise in developing countries</h2> <p>Dawson says she went through a huge learning curve, living in a mud hut, bathing communally from a bucket in the garden and not even being able to see the food on her plate because it was so dark.</p> <p>The great eye opener for her, however, was the extraordinary warmth of the local people and the fact that being able to sell at Fairtrade prices has transformed their lives.</p> <p>Dawson shared accommodation with a young Ugandan woman who hopes to set up her own enterprise, but lacks the knowledge and access to training to be able to succeed on her own.</p> <p>At the start of the week, she wanted to create jam out of avocados, which are freely available, but it soon became apparent that glass jars are not available and there is no custom of eating jam in the community.</p> <p>By the end of the week she had decided to focus on briquettes, which are equivalent to charcoal but are cheaper to produce as they are created from dried out waste farming products and help prevent deforestation.</p> <p>\"The difficulties of setting up a business in rural Uganda are immense,\" says Dawson. \"There is not the money or the skills to get projects off the ground. But this is where NGOs can make a difference by moving away from charity to supporting the creation of profitable businesses.</p> <p>\"I worked with Maureen in developing a business plan and she is going to email it once it is finished. If she is really committed, then I will do my best to help her to finance it. We became really close while I was out there.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Everyone knows there's a housing crisis, and that it's particularly acute in London. But when I started researching London's crisis hotspots I was soon astonished by the scale of the problem.</p> <p>In all but two of London's 33 boroughs at least 1 in 20 people are on council housing waiting lists, and across London as a whole more than 1 in 10 Londoners are on waiting lists.</p> <p>The seven boroughs with the most acute waiting lists (more than 15% of the population on waiting lists) include three of the six Olympic boroughs: Newham, Tower Hamlets, and Barking and Dagenham.</p> <p>In Newham \u2013 home to the Olympic stadium \u2013 the crisis is most acute with nearly 1 in 4 of its residents on the council's housing waiting list. The borough needs an Olympic legacy of affordable housing. If not we know they are looking at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/blog/2012/apr/24/why-newham-council-housing-fix\">deporting residents to Stoke-on-Trent</a>. </p> <p>Nationally there are just over 1.8 million households on waiting lists representing 4.5 million people. London accounts for 354,000 and 886,000 of those respective figures. While this is only slightly more than would be proportionate, the London crisis has the potential to get much worse.</p> <p>These stats paint a frightening picture:<br></p> <ul> <li>Average private rents in London are now \u00a31,038 per month (46% above the UK average), while the average London house price is \u00a3388,000 (72% higher than the UK average)</li> <li>The average rental price of a three-bedroom home in London is over \u00a320,000 per year. </li> </ul> <p>In the last ten years, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/aug/17/house-prices-rise-faster-wages?newsfeed=true\">house prices have risen 94% while wages only by 29%</a>.</p> <p>John McDonnell, <a href=\"http://leap-lrc.blogspot.com/\">LEAP</a> Chair and MP for Hayes and Harlington in West London, explains:</p> <blockquote> <p>These figures demonstrate the unprecedented scale of the housing crisis in our capital city. Unable to gain a council house families are equally unable to afford sky high rents. There is nowhere for them to turn to.</p> <p>As any London MP will tell you, at every constituency surgery you could just weep at the stories of people struggling to get by who just cannot afford London's inflated house prices and become victim to Rachmanite landlords</p> </blockquote> <p>And that's the point. Behind every one of these shocking statistics are thousands of families living in overcrowded and temporary \u2013 and often poor quality \u2013 accommodation. The impact on family life and the life opportunities of children are huge.</p> <p>London's housing crisis is the result of a generation or more of failed policies that need urgent redress. That redress requires multiple policy changes: building new council housing on a mass scale is long overdue \u2013 or else the '<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/apr/25/boris-johnson-kosovo-style-cleansing-poor\">Kosovo-style cleansing</a>' of the poor that Boris Johnson foresaw is unavoidable.</p> <p>In the short term there are only two solutions \u2013 wages and benefits must rise and rents must be capped. Instead though, the government is going in the opposite direction: cutting and capping benefits, while holding back minimum wage increases (just 1.8% in October and a freeze for workers aged under 21).</p> <p>Housing has become an investment opportunity for a few, while for many more it is a constant source of anxiety, insecurity and debt. What we have mapped is London at its most divided: we should not be at home to it.</p> <p>Below are the latest waiting list figures for London for you to explore. Both the 'households' and 'people' are compiled by the <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/\">National Housing Federation</a>, while the borough population data is from the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/index.html\">2011 census</a>. The '% on waiting list' column divides no. of people on council waiting lists by 2011 census population data.</p> <p>This borough by borough breakdown shows that in all but 2 of 33<br>London boroughs at least 1 in 20 of the borough's population are on a<br>council waiting list - while across London as a whole it is 1 in 10 (10.8% -<br>final row on table).</p> <p>Let us know what you think of the data and of the housing situation in London in the comments below.</p> <h2>Data summary</h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"data\">Download the data</a></h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoEZjwuqFS2PdEF2aHVwMkdfcmRIWFNGU2laaThmaUE\">DATA: download the full spreadsheet</a></p> <h2>More data</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p> <h2>World government data</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world-government-data\">Search the world's government data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Development and aid data</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's global development data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a><br>\u2022 Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@guardian.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">Follow us on Twitter</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">Like us on Facebook</a></strong></p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/17/nikola-tesla-museum-campaign-online\" title=\"\">campaign to build a museum</a> to the scientist, inventor and early pioneer of electricity Nikola Tesla has exceeded its fundraising target of $850,000 in just under a week.</p> <p><a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/blog/tesla_museum\" title=\"\">Matthew Inman of The Oatmeal website</a> set up the <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/teslamuseum?c=home\" title=\"\">campaign to raise money</a> to buy the site of Tesla's Wardenclyffe laboratory in Shoreham, New York. The fundraising target was exceeded on Wednesday morning, with around 21,000 people pledging more than $900,000 (\u00a3570,000) in total \u2013 and 39 days of the campaign still remaining.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.markmiodownik.net/Mark_Miodownik/Index-Page.html\" title=\"\">Mark Miodownik</a>, professor of materials and society at University College London, said that Tesla was one of the engineering unsung heroes of the 20th century. \"When you think of engineering of the 20th century, you think of things like going to the moon and the car and the aeroplane and the jet engine. Tesla is right up there with all of those things. He's one of the people who shaped the century because he was at the heart of electricity.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2012/aug/20/geek-mythology-nikola-tesla?CMP=twt_fd\" title=\"\">Tesla is best known for his work on alternating current</a> and his ideas were used in the development of radio communications, the electric motor and radar. Born in Serbia in 1856, he went to university in Graz, Austria, and began working for the inventor <a href=\"http://www.thomasedison.com/\" title=\"\">Thomas Edison</a> in 1884. The pair fell out, however, and each battled for years to convince the world that his way of generating electricity was better and more efficient than the other's.</p> <p>Edison advocated direct current (the kind produced by batteries and solar panels where electrons flow from negative to positive terminals), while Tesla was a fan of alternating current (where the direction of the current changes many times every second). Tesla won the \"current wars\" \u2013 alternating current now powers almost every home and building in the world \u2013 but Edison nonetheless became the richer man through his myriad other businesses.</p> <p>Tesla had bought the 200-acre Wardenclyffe site in 1901 and built a tower with the intention of providing wireless electricity across the world. But that ambition never came to pass and he died a poor man in 1943. The tower built at Wardenclyffe was demolished in 1917 and the site subsequently became a dumping ground for polluted water.</p> <p>The State of New York has agreed to match the funds raised by Inman's campaign, at least up to the initial $850,000, to reach the $1.6m asking price for the Wardenclyffe site.</p> <p>Inman started his campaign in response to a plea several weeks ago from the local <a href=\"http://www.teslasciencecenter.org/\" title=\"\">Tesla Science Centre at Wardenclyffe</a>, a nonprofit group that wants to build a museum and science centre to honour Tesla. Local developers had shown a keen interest in buying the Wardenclyffe site, with reports suggesting they wanted to build apartments or a retail complex.</p> <p>Tesla's name was adopted by the electric car company <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/\" title=\"\">Tesla Motors</a>, which produces the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/feb/03/tesla-roadster-sport-electric-car\" title=\"\">Tesla roadster</a> and is owned in part by eBay founder Elon Musk.</p> <p>\"As Newton said, it is important to build on the shoulders of giants. Tesla was a giant in what he achieved in his lifetime,\" said Mike Short, president of the <a href=\"http://www.theiet.org/\" title=\"\">Institution of Engineering and Technology</a> in the UK.</p> <p>\"Because Tesla had so many claims to his name he has not traditionally been singled out for fame. The Wardenclyffe site will hopefully go a long way to mark the man and his legacy for engineering solutions, and to inspire future engineering talent.\"</p> <p>Miodownik hoped that the public interest around Tesla might signal a wider interest in his work and the potential of engineering. \"It's a slight shiver that goes up my back, because I feel the tide is turning back again to avante-garde engineering as being part of popular culture, which it was in the 20th century and it reached its peak in the Moon landings, where engineering was part of being human - our ambitions were all embodied in engineering.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Since then, we have somehow we have become ashamed of it - we want it for useful things like mobile phones but let's keep it in its place. I like the fact that engineering is part of our wild side. The idea there's this new generation of people who want to celebrate that, that sounds great.\"</p>",
  "<p>Russia's entry into the World Trade Organisation has been a long time in coming. Negotiations began soon after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the demise of communism and have been rumbling on \u2013 with many setbacks \u2013 for the past 19 years.</p> <p>The accession means that the last major economic power has joined the global trading system. Russia was the only member of the G8 group not be in the WTO and the Kremlin will be hoping entry will provide the sort of boost enjoyed by China after it was admitted to the club in 2001.</p> <p>That looks unlikely for three reasons. The economic climate is much frostier than it was in 2001, when the global economy was about to embark on its strongest period of growth since the late 1960s and early 1970s. China's economy was much better equipped to reap the benefits of WTO membership, with a strong manufacturing base contrasting with Russia's over-reliance on oil and gas. Finally, just as it proved impossible for other EU countries to replicate Ireland's Celtic Tiger period, so China gained from being the first former communist giant to join the WTO.</p> <p>There are, of course, still potential benefits to Russia from WTO membership. Moscow is hoping for a surge in foreign direct investment that will help make Russian industry more efficient. Russia's exporters will gain to the tune of $1.5bn to $2bn (\u00a3950m to \u00a31.3bn) a year from the dismantling of foreign barriers. Lower tariffs on imported goods should lead to cheaper goods in the shops, boosting the spending power of consumers.</p> <p>But WTO membership comes at a price. Dismantling protective barriers means that large chunks of Russian industry may struggle to compete. Already, there are doubts about the viability of the automobile sector to survive in a more open trading system. The Kremlin has sought to make the transition less painful by negotiating a phased-in opening up of markets.</p> <p>The WTO has agreed to this, in part because the Geneva-based body needs the accession of Russia to show that it is still functioning despite the stalling of the Doha round of trade liberalisation talks. But it does mean \u2013 given Russia's reputation for being a difficult place to do business \u2013 that foreign firms are likely to take a cautious approach to new investment.</p> <p>Pascal Lamy, the director-general of the WTO, says Russia's entry is not a \"big bang\" accession. China's accession was a pivotal moment in the history of globalisation. Russia's entry looks more like the tidying up of loose ends.</p>",
  "<p>While <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/11/haiti-earthquake-promised-aid-not-delivered\" title=\"\">two years have passed</a> since Haiti's traumatic 2010 earthquake, local residents still insist that crime is their top priority. Not surprisingly, violent crime prevention is also on the agenda of foreign donors and aid organisations. And yet the situation has deteriorated over the past 12 months. What is more, police and justice services are still largely out of reach for ordinary citizens, especially those living in \"popular zones\" of the capital city, Port-au-Prince.</p> <p>The seriousness of the law and order situation is not entirely lost on Haiti's leadership. But the risk is that the government and its backers may attempt to restore security through heavy-handed enforcement measures alone. This might not only make a bad situation worse, but would almost certainly gloss over chronic needs of crime victims. And while Haiti's national police and justice sectors undeniably require support, this cannot be provided at the expense of survivors and their families.</p> <p>Virtually everyone agrees that rates of violent crime have soared in recent months. This spike must be set against Haiti's <a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/mcs/2010/00000026/00000004/art00005\" title=\"\">impressive gains in safety between 2007 and 2011</a>. However, Port-au-Prince's homicide rate spiralled to more than <a href=\"http://pt.igarape.org.br/haitis-urban-crime-wave-results-from-monthly-households-surveys-aug2011-feb2012/\" title=\"\">60 homicides per 100,000 people</a> by February 2012. Recent surveys conducted by the Igarape Institute reveal that despite some fluctuation, it has shifted upwards to roughly <a href=\"http://www.igarape.org.br\" title=\"\">72 per 100,000 by late July</a>. By way of comparison, the global average homicide rate is <a href=\"http://www.genevadeclaration.org/measurability/global-burden-of-armed-violence/global-burden-of-armed-violence-2011.html\" title=\"\">closer to 7 per 100,000</a>.</p> <p>The geographic and demographic characteristics of Haiti's crime wave are unevenly felt. For example, residents of the capital city's slums are more than 40 times more likely to be a victim of homicide than other urban dwellers. The incidence <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2011/dec/06/haiti-rape-survivor-speaks-out-video\" title=\"\">of sexual violence</a> is also especially pronounced among young women and girls regardless of what strata of society they come from. Likewise, property crime and banditry are taking their toll, particularly among the poorer populations of the capital.</p> <p>The impacts of Haiti's recent surge in crime endure long after the shooting stops. Children are especially vulnerable when a death occurs in the family; many are pulled out of school and sent to live with other families as <em>restaveks</em>, Creole for unpaid domestic servants. Since mid-2011, the average costs of a physical or sexual assault on a typical household member amounts to a fifth of their annual income. A murder results in expenses that are more than five times an average family's annual income of $1,200 a year.</p> <p>The costs of violent crime accumulate quickly. For example, burial and funeral costs average almost $5,000 per household. Nearly all of the households we surveyed take out loans to pay these costs. The interest fees charged by money-lenders are extortionate, ranging from 50% to 150% a month. Compounding all this are bribes that are regularly paid out to the police: up to a quarter of all victims of physical assault and property crimes were asked to pay a bribe to see their cases progress. The average cost of these bribes is about $16.</p> <p>Despite these alarming trends, there are some practical steps that the Haitian government and international donor community can take to arrest the costs of violence crime. A priority is a clear affirmation by the country's leaders of the gravity of the situation on the ground. This must be accompanied not with political posturing, but rather action to ensure that policing and justice provision gets to under-serviced areas. Unless this happens, criminal violence will continue rolling back meager development gains.</p> <p>The Haitian government and its supporters can also pay more attention to minimising the crippling debts generated by crime. For example, they can support low-interest loan alternatives for families who have lost their loved ones through violence. Likewise, new oversight measures can be introduced to reduce police bribery which, after a gradual decline, appears to be increasing once more. Finally, special measures can be taken to support victimised children, including with medical assistance, so that they are not traumatised for the rest of their lives.</p>",
  "<p>To get the real point of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaBCsei72Js\" title=\"Video of Von Freeman performing on YouTube\">Von Freeman</a>, the American tenor saxophonist who has died aged 88, you had to hear him in one of the Chicago jazz lounges that he inhabited throughout his long career. Late in life, he came to be recognised as one of the finest tenor saxophonists of his generation, a status he had long been accorded by his peers, many of whom had tried, without success, to prise him away from his home town.</p> <p>Almost half a century ago, Miles Davis made the attempt, when he was looking for a replacement for Hank Mobley. Freeman, however, was adamant in his desire to remain rooted in the Windy City, and it would be many more years before critics and audiences in the wider world became aware of his special qualities.</p> <p>Freeman was not an ingratiating player. His tone could be hoarse, his phrasing angular, his improvisations characterised by note choices and indeed intonation that were not always superficially agreeable. (\"Don't tune up too much, baby,\" he once told a young colleague, \"you'll lose your soul.\") Deeper investigation tended to reveal profound substance, the product of an unorthodox imagination. The emotional commitment could not be missed.</p> <p>He made no recordings under his own name until he was almost 50, and none of those that followed truly captures the essence of his playing. In that he was representative of a small group of outstanding jazz soloists who were heard to their best advantage only in a live setting. I first came across him in 1973, in an ideal environment: one of the small, comfortable South Side clubs where he was among friends and his residencies tended to last for decades. He was accompanied by the outstanding <a href=\"http://www.jazzhouse.org/library/?read=panken11\" title=\"Interview with Von Freeman and John Young\">pianist John Young</a>, a long-term colleague whose reputation was also largely confined to Chicago, and together they sounded like what they were \u2013 unassuming masters of the art of post-bop jazz.</p> <p>During a subsequent conversation it became apparent that resentment was never a component of Freeman's reaction to the experience of being completely ignored by the critical establishment. He was a mature, rounded individual whose crisp intelligence had enabled him to find a place in the world.</p> <p>He was born in Chicago to a trombone-playing policeman father and a mother who played the guitar. His father, said to have been among the city's first black beat policemen, sometimes took him to the famous Grand Terrace Ballroom, where he heard Louis Armstrong, Earl Hines and other stars of the day. His first attempt to play music came at the age of seven, when he tried to fashion a saxophone by wrenching the horn off his parents' Victrola phonograph and boring holes in it. His father responded by buying him a real instrument, and by the age of 12 he was playing professionally.</p> <p>He was also fortunate, as a budding musician, to attend DuSable high school, where a teacher named Captain Walter Dyett encouraged generations of young players. Dyett's alumni including Nat King Cole, Dinah Washington and a whole squadron of saxophonists, including Gene Ammons, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/26/jazz\" title=\"Johnny Griffin obituary\">Johnny Griffin</a>, John Gilmore, Clifford Jordan and Eddie Harris.</p> <p>At the start of the second world war, Freeman played with Horace Henderson's big band and then, until 1945, with a US navy band. After the war he and his brothers George and Bruz, who played guitar and drums respectively, were employed in the house band at Chicago's Pershing hotel, where Freeman took the opportunity to sit in with the stars of the jazz firmament, including Lester Young, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and John Coltrane. He played with Sun Ra in the late 1940s, and his own early quartets included the pianists <a href=\"http://www.ahmadjamal.net/\" title=\"Ahmad Jamal's official website\">Ahmad Jamal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/apr/23/guardianobituaries.obituaries2\" title=\"Andrew Hill obituary\">Andrew Hill</a>.</p> <p>His father was shot during a gang-related incident and died from his wounds, having instructed his sons to look after their mother. Freeman took the words seriously and for many years his priority was to find and preserve steady gigs. In order to support his family \u2013 he had a wife and four children as well as his mother, who lived to be 101 \u2013 he accompanied the bluesmen Jimmy Reed and Otis Rush and the soul singer Gene Chandler and accepted virtually every kind of job available to a black jazz musician.</p> <p>When he reflected on his experience of prolonged neglect, he recalled the lessons instilled by Dyett. \"He taught me discipline,\" he said. \"It's easy to be depressed if things don't go your way, and sometimes in jazz, which is a tough business, they don't. When that happens, you have to stay disciplined.\"</p> <p>The first sign of wider recognition came when his debut album, <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/doin-it-right-now-mw0000051824\" title=\"Review of Doin It Right Now\">Doin' It Right Now</a>, was produced in New York for the Atlantic label by Rahsaan Roland Kirk in 1972, winning a measure of critical acclaim. Immediately after the session, according to the drummer Jimmy Cobb, Freeman rushed back to Chicago to fulfil one of his regular engagements that same evening.</p> <p>Over the subsequent years, he became a more familiar figure in jazz clubs and at jazz festivals around the world, and there would be many more albums, including the outstanding Have No Fear (1975) and several featuring him alongside one of his two sons, <a href=\"http://v2.chicofreeman.com/\" title=\"Chico Freeman's official website\">Chico Freeman</a>, who had become one of the most highly regarded tenor saxophonists of his generation.</p> <p>Last year, Freeman received a Jazz Masters fellowship, the highest jazz honour bestowed by the National Endowment for the Arts.</p> <p>He is survived by his sons, Mark and Chico, from his marriage to Ruby, which ended in divorce. Their daughters, Denise and Brenda, predeceased him.</p> <p>\u2022 Earl Lavon (Von) Freeman, saxophonist, born 3 October 1923; died 11 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>One fugitive from justice fights for human rights, the other for those of animals. Both have long histories of confronting governments and legions of passionate supporters. And now both have skipped bail in foreign countries to avoid extradition to much more powerful nations which they believe want to try them for political reasons. But the similarities between WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, and Paul Watson, charismatic founder of radical marine enforcement organisation <a href=\"http://www.seashepherd.org/\" title=\"\">Sea Shepherd</a>, end there.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/19/julian-assange-us-war-whistleblowers\" title=\"\">Assange is holed up very publicly in the Ecuadorean embassy in London</a> to avoid being sent back to Sweden where he faces questioning on sexual assault charges but fears he will be extradited to the US.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/26/paul-watson-skips-bail-germany\" title=\"\">Watson has disappeared after skipping bail in Germany in the face of allegations by Costa Rica</a> \u2013 strongly denied by Watson \u2013 that he endangered the lives of some of its shark finners back in 2002. The Canadian-born environmentalist who co-founded Greenpeace and has waged a 40 years' war against illegal fishing and marine destruction faced extradition requests from both Costa Rica and Japan, against whom Sea Shepherd have waged a long and bitter war over whales in the Antarctic.</p> <p>But where is Captain Watson? This week I left messages around the world for him in an attempt to invite him to write a piece for the Guardian. Oliver Wallasch, his lawyer in Germany was not taking calls, nor was the European director of Sea Shepherd. The organisation's US HQ in California referred me to <a href=\"http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/2012/08/11/setting-the-record-straight-on-paul-watsons-status-1425\" title=\"\">his legal status on their website</a>, and Watson himself was not answering his US or European phones.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the bridge of the Sea Shepherd flagship, the Steve Irwin, took a call as it steamed off the Western Australian coast but the message was clear: \"We have no idea where Captain Watson is.\" Only his PR company said they had been in contact with him in the past few weeks, receiving several emails from him. But they, too, said they had no idea where he was.</p> <p>The best bet is that Watson is at sea \u2013 his home. Last year he told me he only spent a few days a year on land, and his lawyer last month said that he felt he [Watson] thought he could be of more use to his clients \u2013 the whales and fish \u2013 on a ship than he could in a German or Japanese prison. But if he is not on the Steve Irwin, could he possibly be on either of Sea Shepherd's <a href=\"http://www.seashepherd.org/who-we-are/the-fleet.html\" title=\"\">two other boats, the Brigitte Bardot and the Bob Barker</a>? Both are thought to be in Australian waters preparing, like the Steve Irwin, for a new anti-whaling campaign in the Antarctic against the Japanese, starting in December. Neither ship could be contacted but anyway, it seems unlikely he could have left Europe without the authorities noticing.</p> <p>So could he still be in Europe? The Guardian has been told that his daughter and the head of Sea Shepherd's European office had been seen in Amsterdam. But equally, it was claimed that he may be seeking political <a href=\"http://selvavidasinfronteras.wordpress.com/2012/07/30/the-amazon-pink-dolphins-voice-chilean-senator-juan-pablo-letelier-requested-to-accelerate-political-asylum-for-sea-shepherds-captain-paul-watson/\" title=\"\">asylum in Chile</a> through senator Juan Pablo Letelier, who, it appears, has been asked to \"accelerate political asylum for Watson\".</p> <p>Much more likely is that Captain Watson will apply for political asylum, like Assange, in Ecuador, where President Correa has a strong human rights record and where Sea Shepherd has a long history of working with the national police and the Gal\u00e1pagos to catch illegal fishers and apprehend the shark mafia. The organisation was in 2005 even granted the power to arrest people believed to be fishing illegally and in 2007 Sea Shepherd donated their old US coastguard boat to the marine national park. <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=20070805&amp;id=1p8_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OlYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2994,5962434\" title=\"\">Although Correa once expelled Sea Shepherd's Ecuadorean representative, Sean O'Hearn</a>, relations were patched up and Watson has been very complimentary about Correa.</p> <p>The last hint that Ecuador may be the preferred destination of Watson is that he is known to be good friends with Mariana Almeida, head of Ecuador's vibrant Life Without Frontiers ecological foundation. In a letter to a US website, <a href=\"http://www.dallasblog.com/201207311009291/dallas-blog/international-environment-mission-letter-to-dallas-blog.html\" title=\"\">she recently wrote</a> with apparent knowledge of the legal case Watson's legal team may be expecting to pursue:</p> <blockquote> \"The case of Captain Watson would also be presented to the pertinent human rights commissions and organisations and shall be placed on the agenda of the European parliament, the international agreements shall be respected and it is clear that Germany might need to explain to the European parliament the reason to accept the extradition request from a Caribbean country without an extradition agreement.\" </blockquote> <p>It's not conclusive, but Watson needs all the friends on land that he has got right now. He has proved many times that he is the master of maritime law but whether he can now outwit an array of governments led by the powerful Japanese, may define the rest of his buccaneering life.</p>",
  "<p>Large corporations today are increasingly accepting their role as social actors. With that comes certain responsibilities to society. Some of these are spelt out in legal statutes. Companies should not exploit their workforce, for instance, or pollute the environment. But are there responsibilities that stretch beyond the law? Should companies be held responsible for how their products are used, for instance?</p> <p>To think through these issues, Guardian Sustainable Business brought together experts from the academic, corporate, non-profit and business advisory sectors. At their keyboards for the online debate were: Dr Iain Black, lecturer in marketing at Edinburgh Business School; Karen Hamilton, vice-president, sustainability, consumer goods firm Unilever; Amanda Long, chief executive, consultancy firm Corporate Culture; Dax Lovegrove, head of business and industry relations, environment charity WWF-UK; Michael Maniates, professor of environmental science and political science, Allegheny College in the US; and Carmel Mcquaid, climate change manager, UK retailer M&amp;S. Here's a summary of the main themes:</p> <p><strong>Getting on the pitch</strong></p> <p>If you were to have asked a group of corporate representatives ten years ago about the 'social responsibility' of their firm, you could have bet on some predictable replies: 'Do no harm', 'obey the law', 'give to charity', 'create jobs', and variants thereof. The extent to which expectations have moved on came through powerfully throughout this online debate.</p> <p>None of the panellists defended a socially reductive vision of business as exclusively profit-maximising machines. From the start, the consensus among the panellists was that company responsibilities go beyond the factory gate. Unilever's Karen Hamilton summed it up as follows: should companies \"sit on the sidelines waiting \u2026 or get on the pitch and start addressing the issues?\" She favours the second.</p> <p>Other corporations now concur, maintained WWF's Dax Lovegrove: \"Many leading businesses accept this and are taking action. They see their responsibilities stretching across consumer use and disposal of products, where impacts are often at their highest.\"</p> <p><strong>A preference for partnership</strong></p> <p>So companies have entered the fray, but what are the rules and where do the boundaries lie? Again, Unilever's Hamilton put it succinctly: \"Once a company takes responsibility beyond the factory gates, the only way to work is in collaboration.\"</p> <p>Take deforestation. Forests are chopped down for all kinds of reasons, be it to procure timber, grow soya beans or some other trade-oriented activity. And ultimately trade involves buyers, sellers, regulators, producers and so forth. Only by bringing all parties together will progress be made. Unilever is therefore working with WWF to bring together the main players in the soya, palm oil, sugar and other commodity industries. Through partnership and dialogue, terms of responsible production are beginning to emerge.</p> <p>The implication is that companies have a responsibility to use the influence that their buying power gives them to convene and cajole others to act.</p> <p><strong>Spheres of influence, levels of impact</strong></p> <p>Some like to think of modern mega-corporations as all-powerful entities. They're not. Powerful, yes. But omnipotent, no. Behind the panellists' talk of partnership is an implicit acceptance that corporate influence stretches only so far. Businesses are not lone agents. They require others.</p> <p>All the same, questions of corporate power and influence were shown to be important and legitimate when considering the limits of companies' responsibility. It makes no sense to hold a business entirely responsible for a problem if its part in creating that problem is only partial. Likewise, responsibility \u2013 if it's to be meaningful \u2013 supposes a power for resolution.</p> <p>Effectively what companies do is make judgement calls. Carmel Mcquaid spelt out how this works in practice. M&amp;S, where she oversees the firm's climate change activities, \"hot-spotted\" its carbon footprint across the full value chain: that's to say, it identified where its impacts \u2013 and, therefore, its responsibilities - were highest. Energy use in its own factories was the only area directly under its control, and thus easiest to target. The climate impacts of producers making cotton and food, and of consumers washing clothes, were less direct. Even so, M&amp;S still has influence in these areas and a concomitant responsibility, as its efforts to encourage best practice farming methods and clothes care prove.</p> <p><strong>Stretching back towards suppliers</strong></p> <p>Resolving indirect impact requires the engagement of suppliers. A quarter of Unilever's total greenhouse gas emissions derive from its supply chain, Hamilton revealed. \"It is easier for business to influence its suppliers than to influence consumers\", she admitted frankly. Look no further than Walmart. The US retail giant announced a new sustainability plan a few years ago and, like it or not, its global network of suppliers had to get on board.</p> <p><strong>Reaching out to consumers</strong></p> <p>Companies need to look up their value chain too. Much of the debate revolved around consumer behaviour and company's responsibility for influencing it. The most obvious step is to take unsustainable products off the shelves. Companies are wary of this so-called \"choice editing\". It rankles our \"democratic sensibilities\", consumer theorist Michael Maniates wrote. Yet he and fellow academic Iain Black didn't think that mattered too much. Mostly that's because companies choice edit all the time already.</p> <p>\"The John Lewis partnership, for example, are quite explicit that this is their role\", pointed out Black. M&amp;S's Carmel Mcquaic admitted as much, observing that her company used to have a \"product selector\". If companies are already choosing certain products according to price, quality and value, why not add in a sustainability criterion too?</p> <p>The corporate panellists instinctively preferred alternative tactics to choice editing. Redesigning products, rather than scrapping them, was one option put forward. Hamilton cited <a href=\"http://www.nike.com/nikeos/p/gamechangers/en_US/considered\" title=\"\">Nike's Considered Design</a> approach as an illustrative example. A second option centred around influencing consumer behaviour. Corporate Culture's Amanda Long pointed to <a href=\"http://www.anglianwater.co.uk/about-us/EDCA9E86306447CD91E9169E4A427B7B.aspx\" title=\"\">Anglia Water's Love Every Drop</a> campaign.</p> <p>\"The key is in commitment to invest in well-targeted customer social marketing and then working on moving them to scale\", she argued. Unilever is trying to do that through its <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/mediacentre/pressreleases/2011/five-levers-change-111123.aspx\" title=\"\">Five Levers for Change</a> strategy.</p> <p>Getting people to change their habits ain't easy though. All the panellists agreed on that. Divergence came on what to do about it. Companies just need to get smarter in how they engage consumers, the corporate practitioners argued. The academics disagreed. Educating consumers on how to act isn't enough, they argued. Consumers need to be told.</p> <p>\"The most effective environmental initiatives over the past 20 years or so have come from business and government elites pushing change from the top\", said Michael Maniates.</p> <p><strong>Government standards</strong></p> <p>In practice, that involves coming up with specific sustainability principles and then delivering on them. Companies are beginning to do this at a voluntary level, observed Iain Black. But voluntarism isn't enough, he said. Consumers need reassurance that core principles are being adhered to. \"For this to happen, we need governments involved.\" Sure, companies may be responsible for influencing consumer behaviour. But someone else needs to be responsible for ensuring that they carry out this responsibility. And that someone else, Black argued, should be the state.</p> <p>To read the whole discussion, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/factory-gates-homes-business-responsibility\" title=\"\">please click here</a>.</p> <p><em>To see the full programme of discussions, </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/lets-talk-sustainable-living\" title=\"\"><em>please click here</em></a><em>, and to register for reminders, please complete the form below.</em></p> <p><em>This article forms part of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/series/letstalksustainableliving\" title=\"\"><em>Let's talk sustainable living</em></a><em>, a series of thought provoking conversations around the big challenges facing companies in making sustainable living mainstream.

In May, it warned that global tech spending is weakening faster than anticipated.</p> <p>The US's second-biggest PC maker, Dell on Tuesday forecast revenue would slide 2% to 5% in the fiscal third quarter from the second, to $13.8bn (\u00a383.5bn) to $14.2bn. That lagged Wall Street's target of $14.85bn.</p> <p>Lenovo particularly is now in Dell's rear-view mirror as it grows rapidly: last week it reported quarterly revenues of $8.01bn, up 35%, and net income of $141.4m. Its market share in PCs rose to 14.7%, almost level with the largest PC maker, HP, with 14.8%, according to Gartner.</p> <p>More seriously for Dell, Lenovo is thriving in the smartphone market, selling 7m units in China \u2013 a segment where Dell has tried and repeatedly failed to compete successfully.</p> <p>Now it is predicting earnings per share of \"at least\" $1.70 for fiscal 2013, compared with a previous forecast for more than $2.13.</p> <p>\"People had already expected them to take down numbers, but I think the level to which they are taking down numbers is pretty severe compared to expectations,\" said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross.</p> <p>Pressure from Apple's iPad is telling on a number of PC makers, analysts said. \"In PCs, price pressure continues, and the iPad isn't helping,\" said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee &amp; Leach in San Francisco. \"An entry-level iPad is $399, and on many sites you can find it as low as $360. For a lot of people that's a viable alternative to the PC.\"</p> <p>Dell's consumer-PC segment, which has never been a strength, had its lowest revenue in five years at $2.6bn, on which it generated profits of just $14m. Its Global Large Enterprise division, its largest, saw revenue fall by 1% year-on-year and operating income by 3%.</p> <p>Dell's chief financial officer Brian Gladden said in an interview that the company tempered its outlook for the third quarter partly because it expects distributors to hold off on buying new computers before the late-October release of the latest version of Microsoft Corp's Windows operating system.</p> <p>\"The revenue deterioration we saw in the quarter was clearly above anything we expected,\" he told analysts.</p> <p>To shore up margins and generate revenue growth, Dell is trying to expand further into enterprise computing, where it then goes up against HP, which has an edge in services.</p> <p>On Tuesday, it announced that it had hired ex-HP networking chief Marius Haas to head up its enterprise solutions division and help hasten its push into global services.</p> <p>Enterprise solutions revenue fell 3% to $4.5bn, while server and networking revenue climbed 14%. In contrast, consumer revenue plummeted 22% to $2.6bn and operating profit by 83%, underscoring the plight of the broader PC market, where sales have been flat year-on-year, below broader economic growth trends.</p> <p>Haas, who joined private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts after departing HP, replaces Brad Anderson.</p> <p>Windows 8, to be launched at the end of October, is designed with touchscreen devices in mind. Analysts say it might give PC makers like Dell, HP and Lenovo a chance to win back the market share lost to the iPad.</p> <p>In June, Microsoft took the wraps off the Surface tablet computer, which some analysts see as an attempt to demonstrate the effectiveness of Windows as a mobile platform.</p> <p>But Michael Dell told analysts it could take a while for sales of the device to ramp up, saying that he has heard estimates from Microsoft that the new devices are likely to account for just 1% to 2% of total PC units shipped through the middle of next year. That would equate to about 4m to 8m over the course of the year.</p> <p>Cross said of Dell: \"The jury is out as to whether they will be able to improve their growth rates until they get some Windows 8 tablets out.\"</p> <p>As part of a restructuring, Dell intends to slash more than $2bn in costs over the next three years, primarily from the supply chain and sales group, as it sharpens its focus on the technology needs of corporations.</p> <p>Shares of the company, which plans to pay its first dividend to shareholders this year, remain down 15% in 2012, suppressed by disappointing quarterly earnings and fears that mobile devices are eroding PC spending.</p>",
  "<p>There's a general consensus doing the rounds in industry that if we're not careful we could quite quickly talk ourselves into another recession.</p> <p>This isn't my opinion, but the actual thoughts of thousands of manufacturing SMEs who talk to our advisers every day \u2013 in other words, the people at the coalface of our sector.</p> <p>Recent forecasts have told a sorry story of PMI figures dipping, export sales dropping and, worse still, the spectre of a painful double dip recession. The reality is somewhat different.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mymas.org/news/mas-barometer-shows-2018growth2019-still-there-for-english-manufacturers\">Results from the Manufacturing Advisory Service (MAS) national barometer </a>show that 53% of firms have increased turnover in the past six months, with the same number expecting an upturn in sales between now and the end of the year.</p> <p>Equally impressive, is that more than a third of manufacturing SMEs are looking to recruit and 71% of the 719 respondents questioned believe they will boost export turnover by late 2013. So much for a downturn, you might think?</p> <p>The answer probably lies somewhere in the middle, with increased enquiry levels and investment in premises and machinery both down from the previous barometer.</p> <p>Our role at MAS is to help SME manufacturers grow by giving them access to tailored advice, practical hands-on support and make them aware of relevant funding opportunities.</p> <p>We primarily do this by mobilising a team of 85 experienced advisers to work on-the-ground with companies all over England, developing strategy, new product introductions, export drives and world class manufacturing processes.</p> <p>This gives us an excellent insight into current and future trends, and the anecdotal information we are seeing firsthand currently backs up the signs of growth revealed in the barometer.</p> <p>Manufacturers are saying they are benefiting from the unprecedented \u00a34.5bn of investment flowing into the UK automotive industry. Others have been able to attract new customers through advanced engineering, innovation and world-leading low carbon expertise.</p> <p>The common thread among these stories is that SMEs have been proactive in winning this work. And this hasn't been a scattergun approach, quite the reverse.</p> <p>In today's competitive environment you need a more structured plan to target new markets, both at home and abroad, and you need to be prepared to invest to make it happen.</p> <p>This could be in new marketing material, attending trade shows, developing social media strategies or even funding the necessary R&amp;D required to take core competencies and apply them to complementary industries.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bscdiecasting.co.uk\" title=\"\">BSC (Diecasting)</a> is a perfect example of this in practice. The zinc and aluminium pressure diecaster has more than doubled its turnover since 2009, creating 20 new jobs in the process.</p> <p>When the management team embarked on this growth push they made a concerted effort to invest in new machinery, the skills of their staff and, importantly, re-branding and running a PR campaign. They 'talk the talk as well as walk the walk'.</p> <p>They also made no excuses for being a UK manufacturer \u2013 in fact they made a virtue of it and new orders soon followed \u2013 from the brewing, hydraulics and automotive sectors.</p> <h2>Exports</h2> <p>The specialist focus for this quarter's barometer was export and the results were even more impressive than many experts would have predicted.</p> <p>More than 70% of respondents believe they will increase overseas sales in the next 18 months, with one in 10 expecting turnover to increase by 50%.</p> <p>The appetite is there, but it's not without its issues. Around 40% see generating sales as their biggest challenge, followed by selecting the right agent or distributor (17%) and fluctuating exchange rates (13%).</p> <p>The latter is a game of chess that any company will find difficult to control, but there is support out there for winning work and negotiating your way through the maze that is finding someone to represent you in international markets.</p> <p>UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI) is a fantastic resource that firms can take advantage of regardless of their level of export experience and the UK is well equipped with a network of embassies that offer great contacts and on-the-ground 'know-how'.</p> <p>At MAS, we are in the perfect position to help with the actual manufacturing challenges of exporting also revealed in the survey. The main threats causing management teams sleepless nights were competitive production costs (50%) and meeting international standards (14%).</p> <p>These are both business areas we've been helping SMEs with for almost 10 years by undertaking a business review and then developing an action plan to help them address key needs.</p> <p>Exporting is always a delicate subject for any company. It can be a big risk and if done without the right approach can sometimes be fatal.</p> <p>However, prepare well, identify your strengths and tap into the support on offer and it could well be the best business decision you ever make.</p> <p><em>David Caddle is area director for the </em><a href=\"http://www.mymas.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Manufacturing Advisory Service</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>The majority of people in the UK have never heard of so-called smart meters that show energy use in real time, despite plans by the government and energy companies to install them in all of the country's 30m homes by 2019, <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/tackling-climate-change/smart-meters/6194-quantitative-research-into-public-awareness-attit.pdf\" title=\"\">a series of government-commissioned surveys reveal</a>.</p> <p>More than half (51%) of the 2,396 people interviewed in three face-to-face surveys by Ipsos Mori said they had never heard of smart meters, with a further 5% claiming to own one \u2013 a figure so high compared with the current roll-out that it appeared some of those respondents had misunderstood what a smart meter is.</p> <p>The devices, which are being installed in homes and businesses now but will be fitted on a larger scale from 2014 to 2019, do away with estimated bills, and some can provide real-time energy use via small wireless displays that can be placed in more visible locations than under the stairs to encourage energy-saving.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/30/smart-meter-uk-household-saving\" title=\"\">Households are forecast to save \u00a323 annually on their energy bills by 2020</a> as a result, estimates the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), which commissioned the public attitude surveys published on Tuesday.</p> <p>The research shows widespread indifference to the new meters, with nearly half (45%) saying they had \"no feelings either way\" on supporting or opposing one in every home. A further 4% said they did not know to the same question, with overall 32% supporting them and 20% opposing them. The two most highly cited downsides to smart meters were expense and privacy concerns, with reduction of waste and money savings listed as the two main positives.</p> <p>Despite the current lack of public awareness, Mark England, the CEO of smart meter company <a href=\"http://www.sentec.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sentec</a>, claimed that the UK approach to smart meters would address the problem: \"The advantage of the UK's unique supplier-led rollout is that it's in their interest to educate customers about the energy and money-saving benefits of smart meters to encourage participation and retain their customers. The report has found that the more respondents felt they knew about smart meters, the more likely they were to support the rollout, highlighting once again that if the rollout is to be a success, it is imperative that it remains consumer-focused and that any confusion or lack of knowledge is avoided.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"We should stop the window when the first game is played; then all this nonsense would stop.\" Martin Jol is a Mill reader! Oh. \"If you look at the window now with two weeks to go, it's awful because there are a lot of clubs waiting around until they get the money in [from sales] and if they have got the money then they will come in and of course then you have players with clauses as well, so I think we should do something about it.\" Amen, brother. The Mill has been up all night sorting out this domino trail of potential deals; one false move and before you know it <strong>Bristol City owe Porto \u00a345m for Kieran Richardson</strong>, so long as West Ham sign <strong>Sarah Cracknell on loan from St Etienne</strong>.</p> <p>Closing the transfer window before the start of the season would at least save Tottenham Hotspur from themselves. Internacional have apparently said that they are only <strong>open to an \"extraordinary\" offer for Leandro Dami\u00e3o</strong>, which roughly translates to about \u00a324m. Shakhtar Donetsk want an \"oof, quite a lot\" offer of <strong>\u00a320m for Willian</strong>, but that hasn't stopped the Daily Mail reporting that both deals are going through. According to the Times, if either makes it as far as a medical, <strong>Jermain Defoe will be off to Sunderland </strong>in exchange for the \"go on then\" sum of \u00a310m. If you take a peak in the Mirror (who reckon Atl\u00e9tico Madrid's Falcao is also on the list of strikers Spurs will inquire about and then recoil at the price), the newly appointed club captain Michael Dawson's \u00a39m move to QPR will fund the signing of Ricardo Carvalho. A truly bizarre bit of business.</p> <p><strong>Spurs are also being linked with Adam Johnson</strong>, whose move away from Manchester City depends on the arrival of Scott Sinclair, for whom Swansea would like \u00a36m, not the offered \u00a35m, so that they'll have plenty of change after replacing him with either the <strong>Bristol City winger Albert Adomah or Middlesbrough's Marvin Emnes</strong> \u2013 both available for around \u00a33m. Stare at a spot in the distance for a moment to uncross your eyes. So, Adam Johnson: his preference is for a move to Tottenham or Liverpool, but only Sunderland have actually <strong>tabled a \u00a310m bid</strong>.</p> <p>Martin O'Neill is having a giddy old time of it at the moment, bidding like a bairn who has accidentally opened up Pa's eBay account. <strong>It looks as though Steven Fletcher will be arriving at any moment</strong>, with Wolves having accepted a second chance offer of about \u00a312m. If Kieran Richardson can be flogged to a London club for a couple of million quid, the Blackburn full-back Martin Olsson could be the next arrival at the Stadium of Light \u2013 assuming that Aiden McGeady and Clint Dempsey don't get there first.</p> <p>Roberto Mancini needs to boost his kitty before Manchester City can be turned down by another big-money target, so <strong>off goes Kolo Tour\u00e9 to Lazio or PSG</strong> if the papers are to be believed; John Guidetti, who went on loan to Feyenoord last season, could end up at Sunderland (wa dominoes!); and <strong>Roque Santa Cruz seems likely to sign for Real Betis </strong>having turned down loan moves to Middlesbrough and Celtic. There's a strong chance he'll still need some extra pocket money to sign Javi Mart\u00ednez from Athletic Bilbao. Mart\u00ednez is currently in the midst of agreeing a deal with Bayern Munich, but with negotiations stuck somewhere around \u00a335m, City fancy they can cut in. Otherwise, it's a straight scrap between them and Spurs for the <strong>FC Ashdod midfielder Nir Biton</strong>, the latest poor soul to be dubbed <strong>\"the new Vieira\"</strong>.</p> <p>The Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo feels he's \"a bit light in attacking positions\", which has prompted the Star to furnish their back page with a story saying that <strong>Andr\u00e9 Schurrle is on his way from Bayer Leverkusen for \u00a323.5m</strong>. According to the Mail, however, Leverkusen \"will not sell him this season no matter how much they offer\". Fortunately Chelsea fans only read Frank Lampard's beloved Sun, so will be under the impression that the club is about to <strong>pay \u00a335m to prise Edinson Cavani from Napoli</strong> \u2013 or, failing that, <strong>\u00a345m for Porto's Hulk</strong>. Some, though not a lot, of which could be funded by the cash Crystal Palace pay to take Ga\u00ebl Kakuta on loan for the season.</p> <p><strong>Manchester United are also offloading fringe players</strong>, a sentence that Dimitar Berbatov should never have ended up in. He's about to enrich the lives of Fiorentina supporters for the princely sum of \u00a33m; by those figures, Federico Macheda and B\u00e9b\u00e9 will be sold for \u00a312.99 and 75p respectively. Nani probably isn't going anywhere, mind, with United only prepared to do business at \u00a325m+ and <strong>Zenit St Petersburg not that stupid</strong>. What that means for United's chances of signing Pachuca and the Mexico midfielder Hector Herrera the Mill can no longer tell.</p> <p>Queens Park Rangers are <strong>in talks with Paris Saint-Etienne regarding Kurt Zouma</strong>, the young defender valued at about \u00a38m, and will make some cash back by selling Tommy Smith to Cardiff. Joey Barton's loan move to Marseille could be scuppered by the Football Association, who have asked the French federation to uphold his 12-match ban. Still, who wouldn't want 11 weeks free to read a bit of Sartre, write out Smiths lyrics in an exercise book, and work on pronouncing acatalepsy? <strong>Mark Hughes is also thinking about signing goalkeeper Artur Boruc on a free</strong>, having woken drenched in sweat at the realisation that Robert Green is his No1. On the other side of London, West Ham have increased their offer for <strong>Matt Jarvis </strong>to about \u00a310m, and are close to a loan deal for the Rennes striker Razak Boukari.</p> <p>Staying in London, because that's the best segue the Mill can think of at the moment, <strong>Arsenal could yet miss out on Nuri Sahin</strong>, because Real Madrid like the colour of Liverpool's money better \u2013 they're prepared to agree a loan deal that involves a \u00a314m buyout clause if Sahin decides to stay. That may or may not be because they've got a cheque for \u00a312m on its way from Newcastle, who've now said they won't bid any higher for a player that Liverpool don't want anyway. <strong>Which seems fair enough.</strong></p> <p>On his way out of Newcastle, eventually, is Danny Simpson, who doesn't feel he's being paid his worth at \u00a320,000 a week, and plans to sign a pre-contract agreement with Espanyol in January. By then <strong>Blackburn hope that Huddersfield's Jordan Rhodes will have scored at least 20 goals</strong> for them, having signed before the window closed for \u00a36m.</p>",
  "<p>BHP Billiton has scrapped plans to build the world's biggest open pit copper and uranium mine in Australia amid fears about the impact of the slowing global economy on demand for resources.</p> <p>The Anglo-Australian miner said it was shelving its $20bn plans to expand its Olympic Dam to cover 30 square kilometres of South Australian bush because of falling commodity prices meant it no longer made economic sense.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/08/rio-tinto-first-half-profits-slump?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Slumping demand in China</a>, the world's biggest consumer of metals, has led to a 25% drop in the copper price over the last 18 months. The price of uranium has also fallen sharply as governments globally have slowed nuclear power plant development in the wake of the Fukushima disaster last year.</p> <p>The $20bn (\u00a312bn) Olympic Dam \"mega project\" would have transformed the mine 550km (350 miles) north of Adelaide into a massive open pit capable of producing 750,000 tonnes of copper and 19,000 tonnes of uranium a year.</p> <p>But Kloppers said the failing prices of its important commodities including iron ore and coal, meant BHP was being forced to \"live within our means\".</p> <p>The company, which on Wednesday reported a 26% fall in pre-tax profits to $23bn, had put a freeze on signing off any big new projects. These could include $19bn plans to expand its iron ore harbour in western Australia. Last year the world's biggest miner said it planned to spend $80bn on growth projects over five years.</p> <p>BHP has already committed $22.8bn to projects under way this financial year.</p> <p>The shelving of the Olympic Dam project was attacked by the Australian government, which was relying on the mine to create thousands of jobs and boost the local economy. \"We've been given to understand that BHP were proceeding with an expansion once; we've been given to believe that BHP will proceed with an expansion twice,\" said South Australian premier Jay Weatherill.</p> <p>\"If they come to us and seek permissions and approvals on a third occasion, we will be taking a different approach to the negotiations. That's a prudent and natural approach to take, given our experience, and I think we would be unwise not to.\"</p> <p>Kloppers said politics was not a factor in BHP's decision to scrap its expansion plans but he did point out that the high value of the Australian dollar made development projects and wages more expensive than in other countries.</p> <p>\"This about capex [capital expenditure] escalation,\" he said. \"This is an escalation driven by a tight labour market, a tight supplier market, a high exchange rate and high diesel prices, which has made a concept that we thought would work, unviable.</p> <p>\"As we finalised all the details of the project in the context of current market conditions, our strategy and capital management priorities, it became clear that the right decision for the company and its shareholders was to continue studies to develop a less capital intensive option to replace the underground mine at Olympic Dam.\"</p> <p>The scrapping of the project was welcomed by analysts. Tim Schroeders, a portfolio manager at Pengana Capital in Melbourne, said it was \"pleasing to see that there's some capital discipline\" and BHP was not \"ploughing ahead irrespective of current difficult economic conditions\".</p> <p>Kloppers said he expected commodity prices to remain volatile in the near term, but was more optimistic in the longer term. \"We expect supportive economic policy and a broad growth bias, particularly in China, to lead to measured improvement in the external environment beginning in the first half of the 2013 financial year,\" he said.</p> <p>Growth in China, the world's biggest user of metals, has declined to the slowest pace in three years as the European debt crisis stalls.</p>",
  "<p>Is there something inherently progressive and liberal about online communication sites such as Twitter? Or does it just seem that way?</p> <p>On her Facebook page recently, Guardian columnist Suzanne Moore said she was tired of Twitter because people mostly just follow those they agree with. They're not interested in debate.</p> <p>\"You chose who to follow. There is a whole world of deep dark Twitter if you follow those who don't think like you. But people don't do that. I would not so much say it's leftwing as knee jerk. So outrage over a Daily Mail article happens every day, which is frankly daft. Sometimes it can be about a piece published ages ago but no one had noticed till Twitter went berserk.</p> <p>\"Generally though it is the province of the liberal left and for me it has become more and more unthinking and less and less interesting,\" Moore told Guardian Technology.</p> <p>Moore has a surprising ally. Peter Hitchens, columnist for the Mail on Sunday, has <a href=\"http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2012/06/twitter-is-an-electronic-left-wing-mob.html\" title=\"\">referred to Twitter as an electronic leftwing mob</a> and says that's why he too rarely goes there. \"Not just Twitter, but the internet generally is in favour of sex and drugs and rock'n'roll and I'm not. And there is certainly something about the web for which the natural default is of the left. Morally, culturally and socially, it's definitely leftwing. Morally and socially conservative-minded people aren't on there anyway or may even be unaware of it.\"</p> <p>Hitchens knows he attracts a great deal of abuse on Twitter \u2013 even trending a few times, especially whenever he broadcasts his views on drugs. But this doesn't bother him. \"I don't particularly want to be loved by complete strangers. Lots of people are afraid of being insulted and called rude names. I'm not particularly, but many don't like it and get upset.\"</p> <p>This is one of the reasons he thinks Twitter tends towards mob mentality. Fine if your tweets reflect the prevailing, and assumed, political stance. Scary if you don't. It's a brave soul who tweets against the tide. Could Twitter and other parts of the net actually shut down debate?</p> <p>For anecdotal evidence that Twitter tends to attract leftwingers, if you look beyond your timeline and read tweets on trending hashtags, it can give the impression of a leftwing consensus.</p> <p>For example, when Radio 4's PM presenter Eddie Mair first hosted Newsnight in July, he received warm praise on Twitter under the Newsnight hashtag. But one of his guests, Mark Littlewood, director general of the rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs, had so much abuse heaped on him that one tweeter said he was more unpopular than John Terry, the former England football captain who was accused of racial abuse. (Terry was acquitted.)</p> <p>Dr Rachel Gibson, professor of politics at Manchester University, has studied digital politics since 1999, with funding from the Economic and Social Research Council. She says there is evidence Twitter and other social networking sites tend towards the progressive.</p> <p>\"But this is because Twitter users are early adopters who have higher levels of education than the rest of the population, so tend to be more progressive and open. Also, Twitter is not a mass medium like television. It is still only used by a minority of the population.\"</p> <p>Most of Gibson's studies have been around political blogs which she says are now a bit pass\u00e9 with Twitter taking over as the medium of choice. \"Blogging tended to be adversarial and go against the government in question. So there were lots of rightwing blogs during the Clinton years in the US and during the Labour government here.\"</p> <p>In fact, while there were left or left-leaning governments in the UK, US and Australia, there was a positive flourishing of rightwing blogs, with the left very slow to catch up. \"It suits the right in some ways as the net is seen by them as the essence of the free market, uncontrolled by state. But it may also have just been because the left was in power.\"</p> <p>There is hardly any linkage between left and right online. Rightwing bloggers link to others of the same persuasion and the left do the same, Gibson's studies have shown. \"People don't tend to link to those they disagree with. This has led academics such as Cass Sunstein, who wrote Nudge and The Republic 2.0, to talk about the 'balkanisation of the net', where you only see views you agree with and lose accidental exposure to other views such as those you'd get in a news programme.</p> <p>\"The net actually makes it easier to avoid people you don't agree with or who may challenge your view.\"</p> <p>However, all social networks tend to be homogenous. Why should the net be any different? \"Some Twitter users do like to have adversarial friendships and enjoy debate. But it's far more usual to see groups forming with like-minded individuals. Much the same as happens offline,\" Gibson says.</p> <p>With a Tory-led government, Twitter is more likely to attract leftwingers or those who just oppose the government, says Gibson. And according to <a href=\"http://tweetminster.co.uk\" title=\"\">Tweetminster</a> there are slightly more Labour MPs on Twitter than Conservatives. It's a useful tool in opposition, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/15/life-is-tweet-john-prescott\" title=\"\">John Prescott, with more than 150,000 followers</a>, is among senior Labour politicians who tweet a lot and use it to campaign.</p> <p>Newspaper readers have always gravitated towards newspapers that endorse rather than challenge their views. But what net users need to be aware of is that the web now actively screens out views we disagree with, says Eli Pariser, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Filter-Bubble-Internet-Hiding/dp/1594203008/ref=nosim?tag=guardianreviews-21\" title=\"\">The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You</a>.</p> <p>In it he demonstrates how Google, Facebook, Yahoo and others use algorithms to personalise web searches and services. This is done for commercial reasons so that the experience you get matches your expressed (or inferred) interests more closely, which ought to make you stay with the service longer. It also means advertising can be better targeted.</p> <p>But it's not a win-win: it's insidious, he says, because the filtering out of things we don't express active interest in means we don't know it's happening outside the bubble created by those filters \u2013 and turns what should be global broadcasting into personal narrowcasting.</p> <p>Pariser, co-founder of Avaaz.org, has now set up <a href=\"http://www.upworthy.com\" title=\"\">Upworthy</a> with the aim of offering a broader range of content.</p> <p>Another academic who studies online behaviour is Dr Matthew Goodwin, associate professor at the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Nottingham.</p> <p>\"I suppose those who argue that Twitter is leftwing would make the point that it is mainly populated by higher-educated and more socially mobile professionals, who we know tend to endorse more post-material and progressive values,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Having said that, however, I would also point to the way in which social media tools like Twitter have been embraced by social groups further down the social and economic ladder. I would point to, for example, the way that rioters from more deprived communities utilised Twitter to organise their action and, within my area of research, the way that rightwing extremists have adopted Twitter to communicate directly to potential and current supporters.</p> <p>\"We know both of these groups tend to attract citizens with lower-than-average levels of education and social mobility, so the picture I think is far from clear and I've yet to see comprehensive and reliable research on the socio-demographics and ideological views that underpin Twitter.\"</p> <p>Clearly, more research is needed. As the net matures and attracts more users, academics and politicians will be keen to see how, if it all, it changes political discourse.

  "<p>Despite being an atheist who reasons the world is over four billion years old, I enjoy teaching the opposite idea that God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh. The idea of creation, and the myths and theories associated with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/creationism_1.shtml#h2\">creationism</a>, offer a myriad of philosophical and critical thinking activities that act as an easily accessible introduction to basic theology and philosophy of religion. Moreover, the Biblical story of creation has also had a massive impact on morality, culture and the popular imagination. </p> <p>I was therefore disappointed by a recent <a href=\"http://www.humanism.org.uk/news/view/1078\">British Humanist Association</a> (BHA) statement that said: \"Teaching creationism in RE is no more acceptable than teaching it in science, as pupils who are taught one thing in one subject and then the opposite in another are going to end up confused.\" The statement was a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jul/17/creationist-groups-approval-free-schools\">response to proposals</a> allowing Christian groups to set up free schools, which people fear will lead to creationism seeping into lessons on the Big Bang Theory and evolution.</p> <p>These fears are shared by many and even the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/mar/21/religion.topstories3\">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> has suggested that creationism should not be taught in schools. However, despite the merits of these fears, I would argue that creationism should still be taught in schools, albeit in RE and not science.</p> <p>There are three main reasons why I disagree with the BHA and think that creationism should be included in schools' RE syllabuses.</p> <p>The first is the central part creationism plays in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Approximately <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religions\">four billion</a> of the world's population follow these religions and most of them view God as the creator of the universe. Although most creationists accept the Big Bang Theory and evolution, the story of creation over six days is the starting point of their religious scriptures and also informs teachings on the environment, animal welfare and human rights. In addition, issues such as temptation, free will and sexuality often refer back to the creation story. If we are to teach students about the religions that an estimated 54% of humanity believes, then creationism should have a brief part in RE.</p> <p>Moreover, for sceptics and atheists, the story of Genesis in Judaism and Christianity highlights the more awkward aspects of these faiths, such as sexual inequality owing to Eve's original sin, which has arguably led to the subordination of women throughout Christian history. The use of creationism in RE, therefore, does not have to be seen as forcing literal creationist beliefs upon impressionable children, but rather as way of evaluating and criticising the role of religion throughout history and in modern society.</p> <p>The second reason I feel creationism has a role in RE is that the Biblical story of creation, especially in its Christian guise, has had an immense impact on the cultural heritage of the English speaking world. Whether we use common phrases like \"let there be light\" (Genesis 1:3) and \"breath of life\" (Genesis 2:7) or listen to the music of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creation_(Haydn)\">Joseph Haydn</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_through_the_Secret_Life_of_Plants\">Stevie Wonder</a>, the creation story has had an obvious influence on culture and the arts.</p> <p>And lastly, the third reason for including creationism in RE is that it allows for some basic philosophical ideas to be introduced to students as a way of understanding how human thinking about our origins has changed throughout history. Furthermore, critics of the inclusion of creationism in schools ignore the role that creation myths and theories have played in the history of ideas, especially as Plato, Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas all considered the origins of the world as divine.</p> <p>Additionally, evaluating creationist theories develops the fundamental skills of abstract reasoning and evaluation. From Aristotle's 'unmoved mover' and the <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmological-argument/\">cosmological argument</a> to intelligent design and the literalism of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism#Types_of_biblical_creationism\">Young Earth Creationism</a>, students can make easy comparisons and dismiss what they deem to be weak arguments, which should give them a sense of intellectual empowerment.</p> <p>The BHA need not be alarmed that I am seriously suggesting that a literal interpretation of the creation story equals the Big Bang and evolution, but RE should allow for beliefs about creationism to be studied and debated.</p> <p>Interestingly, I have yet to come across a student who believes in a literal interpretation of the creation story. Although some believe in God and others do not, the BHA's concern that pupils are going to get confused between religion and science is not the case in my experience. Creationism in RE is an opportunity to learn about what creationism is, why people believe it and why people do not. It is a religious belief taught in a subject about religion and beliefs. It is not science and students know that. They should, therefore, be allowed to know what the BHA and others are so upset about. </p> <p>\u2022 The link in the second paragraph of this article was amended on 10 September 2012 to reflect the BHA's clarification of its statement about the teaching of creationism/creation narratives in RE lessons. </p> <p><em>Andrew Jones is head of religious studies and sociology at <a href=\"http://www.goffs.herts.sch.uk/\">Goffs School</a> in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.

  "<p>The government is to unveil a series of measures to promote jobs and growth as ministers move to show they have a credible economic strategy after a slump in corporate tax receipts led to higher than expected borrowing last month.</p> <p>As fears grow among senior figures in both coalition parties that George Osborne is running out of time to meet his pledge to stabilise the public finances, Whitehall sources have spoken of a co-ordinated growth push in September. There will be a particular focus on liberalising planning laws, guaranteeing more housebuilding and boosting infrastructure projects as Osborne prepares to deliver a crucial autumn statement in November that could presage even deeper spending cuts.</p> <p>The moves come as the Institute of Directors warns that the government is doing \"too little, too slowly\" to promote growth. Graham Leach, chief economist at the IoD, called on the government to do more to cut red tape and simplify employment law as a survey found that business leaders were \"battening down the hatches\" amid fears of a prolonged recession.</p> <p>In a sign of the government's radical thinking, ministers are drawing up plans to reform the Highways Agency so it can borrow money to pay for a \"horizon shift\" in spending on roads to boost the economy and reduce congestion and delays. </p> <p>The agency, which runs the network of motorways and A-roads, could be made more independent, most probably as a government-owned company or public trust, so it can borrow without increasing the public deficit. \"We have already made a lot of growth announcements,\" one government source said. \"But obviously the garden needs watering often.\"</p> <p>The moves to burnish the government's pro-growth approach came as a sharp fall in tax receipts last month led to a \u00a3557m deficit in public sector net borrowing. This compared with a \u00a32.8bn surplus in the same month last year and was way below the \u00a32.5bn surplus expected by analysts.</p> <p>The Treasury blamed a cut in North Sea oil and gas production after a fire at the Elgin platform deprived the exchequer of around \u00a31bn in tax receipts. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that Osborne may fail to meet the forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that borrowing will fall from \u00a3125bn last year to \u00a3122bn this year.</p> <p>The borrowing increase sparked unease in both coalition parties. Lord Oakeshott, the former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, said: \"How much more evidence do we need that boy soldiers firing pop guns at our recession won't work? Now we need two big bazookas - making the banks lend, with RBS nationalised, and building 100,000 more houses a year, led by desperately needed social housebuilding.\"</p> <p>From the right, the former Tory cabinet minister John Redwood called for tax cuts and spending cuts after the OBS figures showed government spending in July grew by 5.1% on the previous year, mostly on welfare payments.</p> <p>Treasury sources said the increase in borrowing was largely explained by the fall in corporation tax receipts, 75% of which was due to a drop in North Sea revenues. They pointed out that the main sources of tax revenue - VAT, income tax and national insurance - are on track or ahead of forecasts.</p> <p>\"It is a difficult environment because the global economy is weak,\" one source said. \"We have to hold our nerve and stick to our plan.\" Osborne will be waiting to hear whether the OBR decides the fall in tax receipts is temporary, cyclical, or structural. \"If it is permanent, there will be adjustments,\" a Treasury source said.</p> <p>The chancellor may have to extend planned spending cuts beyond the extra two years announced last year. He may also embrace deeper cuts, including an extra \u00a310bn in welfare spending reductions. This will not amount to a rewriting of the chancellor's \"fiscal mandate\" on the deficit because this is assessed on a rolling five-year basis, which means that no definitive judgment ever needs to be made. </p> <p>If the OBR decides that the fall in tax receipts is permanent, the chancellor could run into trouble on the second part of his mandate - ensuring that debt as a share of GDP is falling by 2015-16.</p> <p>Labour said the increase in borrowing showed the chancellor's strategy was failing. Rachel Reeves, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"This is a damning indictment of a chancellor who promised to secure the recovery and get the deficit down. His failed plan has delivered the exact opposite - a double-dip recession which is leading to soaring borrowing.\"</p> <p>The government will take the first steps in outlining its latest plans to promote growth tomorrow when it publishes a report on housing by Sir Adrian Montague. This is expected to say the government needs to lend publicly owned land to developers and relax requirements for building schemes to include social housing. Housing will be at the top of the list of growth announcements next month as ministers outline a guarantee on housebuilding. Planning laws will be liberalised, though Tory sources said there would be no threat to the green belt.</p> <p>The plans to reform highways funding, proposed by David Cameron in March, are part of longer-term thinking. A key reform will be in funding a new body to pay for ongoing operations and service its debts.</p> <p>Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: \"It's clear that ministers are now casting around for anything that might produce growth without thinking of the long-term consequences or value for money for taxpayers.\"</p>",
  "<p>In 1902, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frederic_Still\" title=\"\">George Still</a>, the father of British paediatrics, gave one of the earliest descriptions of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), calling it a \"moral defect without general impairment of intellect\" characterised by an \"abnormal incapacity for sustained attention\".</p> <p>While the second part remains largely true, causal theories have moved on from descriptions of a \"moral defect\". Brain imaging studies in particular have shown that there are structural and functional changes that underpin ADHD symptoms, and in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22560046\" title=\"\">a paper published last month in the journal Biological Psychiatry</a>, a group at the Institute for Disorders of Impulse and Attention in the University of Southampton assess one of the newest ways of studying ADHD \u2013 by coupling brain imaging with neuroeconomics. They speculate that the condition may be associated with \"suboptimal\" economic decisions.</p> <p>At its core, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21550365\" title=\"\">neuroeconomics attempts to understand the neural basis of economic decision making</a>. All economic decisions involve an infinitely complicated set of interacting networks in the brain that adjust and implement plans that are aimed at securing a desired outcome. In children with ADHD, decision making is often compromised because they cannot wait for a reward \u2013 a phenomenon known as \"delay aversion\".</p> <p>This means that a smaller reward, received now, is often preferred over a more substantial reward in the future. Brain imaging studies have found that ADHD children have a hypersensitivity to delay that often translates into a desire to receive a reward as quickly as possible.</p> <p>An attention network that lies in the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain also seems to be underactive in ADHD children. Treatment with the drug Ritalin can increase activity in a structure that lies at the heart of this network \u2013 the dorsal anterior midcingulate cortex. This can ramp up activity in the attention network and increase the brain's ability to tolerate a delay before it receives a reward.</p> <p>In a resting state, when we let our minds wander, another very interesting network called the default mode network appears to motor along in the background. First discovered in 1995 <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21713118\" title=\"\">by researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin</a>, the default mode network is not only active during introspection and day-dreaming, but also deactivates as soon as we begin to attend to a task that requires a bit of serious thinking.</p> <p>In ADHD children, however, the default mode network does not seem to cut out when it should, so when they switch to a task that requires focused thought, the default mode network's activity can interfere with concentration.</p> <p>Money, attractive faces and appetising foods consistently activate a third brain network that deals with rewards: the frontostriatal network. This network weighs up the pros and cons of different choices and when it malfunctions there is a reduced ability to link rewards with actions. Memory is also important here as the brain must be able to hold different alternatives in mind so that it can fully explore the implications of different choices.</p> <p>Children with ADHD have difficulty holding different choices in mind, which in turn leads to poorer decision making. Research has shown that children with ADHD have a reduced concentration of dopamine receptors in this reward network. Again, drug treatment can help to boost its activity and improve the brain's ability to consider different choices before it makes a decision.</p> <p>But the story of ADHD is not all negative \u2013 there must be good evolutionary reasons for retaining ADHD traits in the population. Some of the positive aspects of ADHD include increased creativity and novel problem-solving abilities. Evolution needs variability and new avenues, and it is possible that those with ADHD will seek directions that would otherwise remain unexplored.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/173/abstract\" title=\"\">interesting genetic study of a Kenyan tribe</a>, researchers at Northwestern University in the US looked at the DRD4 7R gene, which has been linked with ADHD and novelty seeking. Only people with this ADHD-related gene were studied, but one group had recently settled into a community while a second group remained nomadic.</p> <p>The nomads with the ADHD-related gene were found to have a higher <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/\" title=\"\">body mass index</a> than their settled counterparts with the gene. Novelty-seeking and increased impulsivity may have helped the nomads to obtain food. The researchers also suggested that the shorter attention span conferred by the DRD4 7R gene might help nomadic children to learn more efficiently in a rapidly changing outdoor environment.</p> <p>In contrast, a similar attention span in the settled children would interfere with their learning in school. So the DRD4 7R gene may be more suitable for a nomadic lifestyle and less suitable for the sustained attention needed to make a living buying and selling goods in a village or town market place.</p> <p>All of which raises some interesting prospects for expanding these kinds of studies into the field of trading and banking for a more precise look at the neural goings-on behind some of our more spectacular financial failures.</p> <p>So what was once vaguely described in a fit of hand-waving as \"a moral defect\" is now being understood in ever more sophisticated ways as a dysfunction of many different brain networks that control decision making, memory and goal setting. As neuroeconomic and brain imaging tools shed more light on ADHD, a more subtle understanding of its symptomatology will also be vital for developing new treatments.</p>",
  "<p>Pupils' education is suffering because their teachers' pay is negotiated centrally, according to new research that finds a pupil's exam performance drops by an average of one GCSE grade when there is a 10% rise in local private sector salaries.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmpo/publications/papers/2012/wp293.pdf\" title=\"\">study</a>, by academics from the University of Bristol, analysed data from around 3,000 state secondary schools in England, which educate 3m children a year.</p> <p>Current national pay scales for teachers allow for little regional variation; the average differential in teachers' wages between inner London and north-east England is 9% compared with 30% for private sector jobs, the study says.</p> <p>This can cause difficulties in recruitment and retention, especially of the best teachers, the paper's authors say.</p> <p>Carol Propper and Jack Britton, of the Centre for Market and Public Organisation, write: \"High ability teachers might decide to leave the profession, move within the profession to a region where the relative wage is higher, or be deterred from entering teaching in the first place.\"</p> <p>The study accounted for a school's intake to allow for different levels of difficulty in educating pupils of varying backgrounds. The research finds that a 10% increase in the average wage over five years is associated with a drop of one GCSE grade in one subject, per pupil.</p> <p>The study's authors say the losses in school performance from keeping teachers' wages too low in expensive areas outweigh the gains from overpaying teachers in cheaper areas.</p> <p>A separate <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f432a740-dc95-11e1-bbdc-00144feab49a.html#axzz24CEzVCkE\" title=\"\">analysis</a> published earlier this month found that schools in London, where the wage differential is sharpest, outperform schools in the rest of the country.</p> <p>However, Propper said the effect of the wage difference in London may be masked by the fact that the capital draws young teachers. She said: \"Obviously there are other things going on beyond pay. In London we would say that schools would do even better if you removed the wage regulation.</p> <p>\"What happens in London, is that a lot of young teachers go to work for their first four or five years, and they may be doing some very good work by the time they are only three or four years out of teacher training college. They leave, and can be replaced by another crop of young people who want to come to London. The problem is in the places that are high-wage but don't attract the London kudos.\"</p> <p>Propper's study was based on data from 2002 to 2008, before there were large numbers of academy schools in the system. Academies can deviate from the national pay scale, although <a href=\"http://www.reform.co.uk/content/12913/research/education/plan_a_unleashing_the_potential_of_academies\" title=\"\">a survey</a> published in March found that two-thirds have not altered pay and conditions.</p> <p>Earlier <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/efm/news/2010/45.html\" title=\"\">research</a> by Propper found that centralised pay regulation for nurses harmed patients. Patients in hospitals where nurses' wages were low compared to the general labour market were more likely to die after an emergency admission for a heart attack.</p> <p>The education secretary, Michael Gove, has proposed that state schools should be allowed to set their own pay.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/inthenews/inthenews/a00209099/government-sets-out-case-for-reforming-teachers-pay\" title=\"\">letter</a> to the School Teachers' Review Body, which sets guidelines for teachers' pay, he asked for advice on \"how the pay framework for teachers should best be made more market-facing in local areas\".</p> <p>Gove also requested guidance on a closer link between pay and performance and other reforms to \"raise the status of the profession\". The review body is due to report back in late September.</p> <p>Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said pupil performance depended on a range of factors, including properly funded schools, the home environment and the skill of teachers.</p> <p>She said: \"It is this government's policy of cutting the real and relative value of teachers' pay that will make teaching as a career much less attractive and cause real issues with recruitment and retention. As independent research has shown, removing centralised pay regulations for teachers would simply reduce teacher mobility and lead to teacher shortages in areas of lower pay.\"</p>",
  "<p>Out in the charity world a debate is raging which echoes one in the public sector: is there a legitimate role for the private sector in the delivery of key services? Can those motivated by profit be trusted to prioritise the needs of those for whose benefit a service is provided?</p> <p>At issue is the <a href=\"http://nationalcitizenservice.direct.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">National Citizens' Service (NCS)</a>, a Coalition initiative to support and nurture 16- and 17-year old community leaders of the future, built up as comparable existing schemes were axed. 60 charities are already involved in NCS and last year's 8,500 participants will grow to 30,000 this year. To meet its target of 90,000 by 2014 the Government is recruiting partners to run 19 regional NCS schemes in England. A favourite to win in eight regions is a consortium, <a href=\"http://www.ncsnetwork.net/\" title=\"\">NCS Network</a>, involving V, <a href=\"http://www.nya.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the National Youth Agency</a>, <a href=\"http://www.catch-22.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Catch-22</a>,<a href=\"http://www.ukyouth.org/\" title=\"\"> UK Youth </a>and\u2026 <a href=\"http://www.serco.com/\" title=\"\">Serco</a>.</p> <p>Some local authorities believe that they had a raw deal when Serco addressed their 'failing' services. Serco is one of a handful of companies whose process-driven business (they sell 'how' rather than 'what') tends to feed an image of ambulance-chasing ubiquitous grabbers of public money. And they are highly successful, with an annual global revenue of over \u00a34 billion.</p> <p>Many of Serco's 600 relevant business units are populated by former local authority employees who see the company as their way to deliver good services in a better paid and more innovative way than the public sector allows. It is a company that lists partnerships with the third sector as one of its goals; and which is building and running a new prison alongside charity partners Catch-22 and <a href=\"http://www.turning-point.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Turning Point</a>. (Although controversial when forged in 2009, most now believe that this alliance will improve prison outcomes). Serco is also regularly near the top of <a href=\"http://www.bitc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Business In The Community's</a> ethical business league.</p> <p>Battle lines are being drawn: Serco could receive over \u00a3100 million of public money for NCS and some don't like it, though <a href=\"http://www.volunteering.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Volunteering England</a> suggests that investment through a stable and competent facilitator like Serco is crucial to resurrecting volunteering infrastructure.</p> <p>The noises coming from NCVO, the sector's largest umbrella body, fall short of a ringing endorsement. <a href=\"http://www.navca.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NAVCA</a> is also sceptical, raising the prospect of private sector cherry picking and third sector floor sweeping. Sir Stephen Bubb, leader of charity chief executives' body<a href=\"http://www.acevo.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> ACEVO</a> is more realistic, arguing that the nature of the contract will determine its success - as long as they remain partners and do not adopt the prime contractor model of the Work Programme which has failed to engage other sectors as equal in stature to those seeking profit.</p> <p>The fact is this: the third sector does not have the experience or capacity to deliver a national or even a regional programme on this scale. Logistics is what Serco does best. In general terms, private companies have skills, experience, capacity and other qualities from which both the third and public sectors could - should - benefit.</p> <p>In the best case scenario companies are corporate citizens who help those who serve to deliver the best possible benefits, as Serco proposes here; in the worst case the outsourcing express is leaving the station. The voluntary sector not only needs to be on board but needs to be near the private sector driver's cab if they are to influence where it is going.</p> <p><em>Tom Levitt is a writer and consultant on third sector issues.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>One of Africa's most powerful and divisive leaders, Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, has died of an undisclosed illness, raising fears of a regional power vacuum.</p> <p>David Cameron was among the world leaders who paid tribute to Meles, a towering political figure who shaped modern Ethiopia in his own image. The country is now one of Africa's fastest-growing economies and among the United States' closest allies on the continent. But human rights groups condemned Meles as an authoritarian strongman whose 21-year rule was marred by rigged elections and the persecution, imprisonment and torture of critics.</p> <p>Meles, 57, died in a hospital in Brussels on Monday after contracting an infection, authorities said. The prime minister had not been seen in public for about two months, and speculation about his health increased after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/ethiopia-meles-zenawai-not-seen\" title=\"\">he failed to attend a meeting of African Union heads of state in the capital, Addis Ababa, last month</a>.</p> <p>Thousands of mourning Ethiopians descended on the centre of the Addis Ababa as his body was flown back from Brussels.</p> <p>His demise raises the prospect of political turmoil in Africa's second most populous country. Kenya's prime minister, Raila Odinga, said: \"One fears for the stability of Ethiopia upon his death, because you know that the Ethiopian state is fairly fragile and there is a lot of ethnic violence \u2026 I don't know that [Ethiopian politicians] are sufficiently prepared for a succession: this is my fear \u2013 that there may be a falling out within the ruling movement.\"</p> <p>Hailemariam Desalegn, 47, appointed deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister in 2010, will be sworn in as prime minister after an emergency meeting of parliament, said Bereket Simon, the communications minister. On Tuesday, state TV showed pictures of Meles against a soundtrack of classical music. Thousands of mourners thronged outside the airport in Addis Ababa as they awaited Meles's coffin, some holding portraits of the late prime minister and placards that said \"We will continue what you have begun.\" Groups of women dropped to the ground ululating and sobbing.</p> <p>One mourner, Rosa Betemariam, who had been living and working as a dental nurse in the US, said: \"I am devastated. I am visiting Ethiopia after not having been home for 20 years. I am overcome by joy and sadness. I am so sad at his passing but also amazed at what Meles has done for this country. I cannot recognise this city. His vision as a leader has transformed Ethiopia.\"</p> <p>Sitting in a khat bar, where people chew the narcotic leaf, Abraham Getachew, an engineering student, said: \"As a human being, I am upset at the news of his death. But I am not sad that we have lost him as a leader. We do not feel that we have benefited from his leadership. Seventy per cent of students cannot find employment. We want to play a part in the development of Ethiopia but we have not been afforded this opportunity.\"</p> <p>There were numerous tributes from within Africa and beyond. The African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa, said: \"The death of Prime Minister Meles has robbed Africa of one of its greatest sons.\" Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said: \"Meles Zenawi was an economic transformer, he was a strong intellectual leader for the continent.\"</p> <p>Cameron described Meles as \"an inspirational spokesman for Africa\" on global issues. \"His personal contribution to Ethiopia's development, in particular by lifting millions of Ethiopians out of poverty, has set an example for the region,\" the British prime minister said.</p> <p>The US viewed Meles as a strong security partner in the war on militant Islamism and has given hundreds of millions of dollars in aid over the years. US military drones that patrol east Africa, especially over Somalia, are stationed in Ethiopia. At the end of 2006, Somalia's UN-backed government asked Ethiopia to send troops into Somalia to try to put down an Islamist insurgency. Ethiopian troops moved in and captured Mogadishu, but the Somali population rebelled against what it saw as an occupation and Ethiopian forces withdrew in 2009.</p> <p>Ethiopia again sent troops to Somalia in early 2012 as part of an increased international effort to pressure the al-Qaida affiliated group al-Shabaab.</p> <p>On Tuesday al-Shabaab welcomed Meles's death. \"We are very glad about Meles's death. Ethiopia is sure to collapse,\" spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage told Reuters.</p> <p>Human rights groups have long denounced Meles's government for its use of arbitrary detention, torture and surveillance of opposition members. Under a 2009 anti-terror law more than 100 opposition figures have been arrested; the government insists it is tackling rebel groups that have links with al-Qaida and Eritrea. More than 10 journalists have also been charged under the law, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p> <p>Claire Beston, Amnesty International's Horn of Africa researcher, said: \"The 21 years of Meles Zenawi's rule were characterised by ever-increasing repression and widespread human rights violations. \"His government stamped out dissenting voices, dismantled the independent media, obstructed human rights organisations and strangled political opposition.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Ethiopia's jails are packed to the seams with suspected political opponents - from urban intellectuals to rural farmers. Torture and ill-treatment are commonplace. State resources, assistance and opportunities have been broadly used to control the population. Tens of thousands of Ethiopians were forced to flee the country during his rule.\"</p> <p>Critics saw Meles as paying only lip service to democracy. Opposition members accused him of rigging the 2005 election and, when demonstrations broke out, security forces killed at least 200 people and jailed thousands. Almost the entire leadership of an opposition group that won an unprecedented number of seats in parliament was jailed for life for treason.</p> <p>In 2010, Meles won a further five years in office while receiving a reported 99% of the vote in an election that the US and other international observers said did not meet international standards.</p> <p>Meles' legacy will be debated. Under him, Ethiopia recorded improvements in education with the construction of new schools and universities. Women gained more rights. In the mid-2000s Ethiopia experienced strong growth, tripling in size in 15 years, which won Meles plaudits. The International Monetary Fund in 2008 said Ethiopia's economy had grown faster than any non-oil exporting country in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>But many Ethiopians complain that his close business ties with China did not translate into more jobs. Ethiopia remains heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for 85% of employment. Per capita income is only about $1,000 - about $3 a day.</p> <p>Henok Beyene, an artist, said: \"Meles was an autocrat. Ethiopians have no experience of democracy, we have only ever experienced leadership from autocrats. Zenawi's genius was in how he controlled the minds of his people. He led everyone to believe there was no alternative to his leadership by creating a climate of fear and intimidation.\"</p> <p>Meles is survived by his wife, Azeb Mesfin, an MP, with whom he had three children. State TV said funeral arrangements would be announced soon.</p>"
