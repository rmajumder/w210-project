  "<p>When the Bo Xilai issue first erupted in March and the details of Neil Heywood's murder began to emerge, it was commonly accepted that this posed a huge challenge to the Chinese leadership at a most sensitive time \u2013 the imminent change in the composition of the party and government leadership, an event which is surely of greater significance for the world than the forthcoming US presidential election.</p> <p>There was understandable speculation that Bo Xilai's detention could lead to wider rifts in the party leadership that might prove very difficult to manage and which might even lead to the postponement of the forthcoming party congress until the early months of next year.</p> <p>Following the trial of Gu Kailai, Bo Xilai's wife, and her sentencing on Monday, we can now view these events from a different vantage point. Whatever the widespread misgivings about the trial and the closed nature of the proceedings \u2013 and the fact that the whole process has clearly been vetted at the highest levels \u2013 the explanation as to what happened, the verdict and now the sentence has commanded a certain degree of credence. The explanations, though far from comprehensive, are, in the circumstances, more or less plausible: the conflict between Gu and Heywood, the threat to her son, the nature of their financial dealings, and the subsequent murder.</p> <p>Likewise, the nature of the sentence \u2013 a suspended death penalty that could in practice mean a prison term of 14 years \u2013 has been viewed in the west as not inappropriate.</p> <p>After months when it appeared as if the scandal might derail the party leadership, it now appears as if it is once more firmly in control of events. Any wider rifts that might have existed now seem to be under control \u2013 or, more likely perhaps, the ructions following Bo's arrest were rather more limited than some have speculated, though in the absence of any hard information it is impossible to be sure.</p> <p>With the Gu Kailai trial now closed, there remains the key question of what will happen to Bo himself, the overwhelmingly dominant player, without whom Heywood would still be unknown and Gu likewise. Bo Xilai is being investigated for \"serious disciplinary violations\" and it is widely expected that some kind of conclusion will be reached in the matter prior to the party congress.</p> <p>Are there any conclusions that might be drawn at this stage, premature as they may well prove to be? From outward appearances, it seems as if the party is now within touching distance of overseeing a smooth transition to a new leadership, with Xi Jinping as the next president and Li Keqiang as the next premier. This will only be the second time this has been achieved since Mao, the first being the handover from Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao. Similarly wholesale changes in the standing committee of the party, presently composed of nine people \u2013 and the body to which Bo was so energetically and ruthlessly campaigning to be admitted \u2013 are likely to be achieved without too much collateral damage.</p> <p>There has been much speculation that, with China facing a new and difficult set of challenges, the Bo case was likely to become entwined with a range of growing policy disagreements. The difficult policy choices have certainly not gone away but it would appear that the Bo case has been sidelined without it serving to exacerbate the debates that are occupying the present leadership and which will surely dominate the agenda of the incoming leadership. This is no mean achievement.</p> <p>It has been suggested, finally, that the Bo case is the biggest political conflict to have shaken Beijing since the Cultural Revolution. This has always appeared to be something of an over-statement. One only has to think of the prolonged struggle between Mao's chosen successor, Hua Guofeng, and Deng Xiaoping after Mao's death to realise that this was a febrile exaggeration. Given the issues that we now know were at stake in their argument, then whatever the present disagreements, they could hardly have been more fundamental or far-reaching than those between Deng and Hua. Deng, after all, was about to take China in an entirely new direction and utterly transform the country in the process.</p> <p><em>Martin Jacques is the author of When China Rules the World: The End of the Western World and the Birth of a New Global Order</em></p>",

Since the G4S Olympics fiasco, does anybody still believe the private sector delivers improved services or savings? London Met's vice-chancellor, Malcolm Gillies, and his friend in government, David Willetts, certainly do, and so does Willetts' close adviser Jonathan Woodhead, who since the general election has worked for London Met. But no one outside the upper echelons of power at London Met Uni does, and certainly not Unison members, who are fully behind our campaign to stop their neoliberal experiment on our already troubled university.

  "<p>The fact that interest rates are low does not make this a good time to embark on new public infrastructure spending (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/15/george-osborne-economists-austerity\" title=\"\">Experts attack Osborne over austerity plan</a>, 16 August). It was in large part a decade of over-borrowing on infrastructure projects, such as Gordon Brown's school-building programme, that got us into our present problems. At the moment, investors see the UK as safe in comparison to the eurozone, so are willing to accept low or even negative interest rates. That is because the UK has a credible, if slow, plan to reduce its overspending. An infrastructure spending binge would destroy that credibility and force rates up, making it impossible to close the deficit and putting us into a Greek/Spanish debt cycle. Any money the nation has left for capital projects should be spent by private businesses, which have a better record of spending it productively than do politicians and civil servants.<br><strong>Dr Eamonn Butler</strong><br><em>Director, Adam Smith Institute</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008It is two and a half years since 20 prominent economists helped to justify George Osborne's austerity strategy by publicly supporting it. None had earned the credibility of having forecast the crisis, yet their opinions were acclaimed not just by Osborne but by the rightwing press. Since then, the chancellor has cut investment spending by \u00a324.4bn (a 48% reduction), the UK economy continues to stagnate in a double-dip recession, the government is set to borrow \u00a311.8bn more than Labour had planned, and suicides have increased by 3.6%. Surely the coalition should, to paraphrase Osborne, \"stop rewarding failure\", and sack the chancellor. And the solution for his successor, just look a bit further than Simon Jenkins (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/14/busted-british-economy-more-olympic-spirit\" title=\"\">Our busted economy needs more than Olympic spirit</a>, 15 August), with a debt jubilee (quantitative easing) not for banks but for people. Yes, \"return to taxpayers the cash Coe demanded they give him seven years ago\", with the stipulation that households in debt first use the money to pay it off before spending anything. For others, not in debt, it is a windfall to spend. The reduction in debt frees people to spend, as does the windfall, both of which would stimulate demand in the economy.<br><strong>David Murray</strong><br><em>Wallington, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Simon Jenkins is right to identify deficient aggregate demand as the main factor contributing to the recession and that the current policy regime of austerity is exacerbating the problem. Unfortunately, his proposed stimulus is unlikely to offer little more than a short-term respite. In a world dominated by transnational corporations and monopoly capital, any short-term Keynesian stimulus to demand is most likely to be satisfied by companies sourcing production from abroad, thus exacerbating the trade deficit and possibly the fiscal deficit, while stoking inflationary pressures. A more nuanced and long-term approach is required: one that involves the state taking an active role in rebuilding the nation's industrial capacity. This needs to be combined with fundamental changes in the economic governance of firms, banks and industries. Only then might the UK economy begin to emerge from its present slumbers.<br><strong>Dr Phil Tomlinson</strong><br><em>University of Bath</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Oh ye of short memory! Simon Jenkins seems to have forgotten that the Japanese tried his proposal of giving \u00a31,000 to every family, a few years ago, and 90% of it went straight into savings accounts!

  "<p>Since the end of the last century, the expression \"rogue state\" has become increasingly acceptable within international public&#xa0;discourse. Driven by&#xa0;US&#xa0;propaganda, the concept aims to demonise countries opposed by Washington by portraying them as global threats.</p> <p>However, in recent years, this argument has been turned against the&#xa0;White&#xa0;House. An alternative view is&#xa0;gaining traction \u2013 namely that the main rogue state of the planet and the greatest terrorist threat to world peace is&#xa0;none other than the United States, and it has the backing of the likes of eminent US intellectuals Noam Chomsky and William Blum, and the film director Oliver Stone.</p> <p>Viewed from South America, the UK has done more than enough to share that accolade with its US cousins, and the attitude in Britain to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/julian-assange\" title=\"\">Julian Assange</a> is simply the latest example. The Ecuadorean foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, reported that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum\" title=\"\">the British government transmitted to Quito</a> an \"explicit threat in writing that they may assault our Ecuadorean embassy in London if we do&#xa0;not deliver Julian Assange\".</p> <p>The British foreign secretary, William&#xa0;Hague, later confirmed the threat, thus breaching the Vienna convention, which establishes the immunity of diplomatic headquarters, something that not even the bloodthirsty South American dictators Jorge Videla and Augusto Pinochet dared to do.</p> <p>As the spokesperson for the Russian foreign minister noted: \"Everybody knows that tens of alleged criminals, whose extradition is requested by many countries, including Russia, found asylum and feel safe in Great Britain. Why then refuse to do the same in the case of&#xa0;Assange?\" Worse still, London extended a welcome to one of the bloodiest Latin American dictators, Pinochet, but denies it to Assange. This&#xa0;regrettable moral double standard&#xa0;speaks for itself.</p> <p>It seems that Assange's offence of publishing the schemes and crimes secretly committed and supported by&#xa0;those who would lead us is unforgivable. As a result, the US has mobilised its&#xa0;friends and allies worldwide in order&#xa0;to capture the WikiLeaks founder, even if it must breach international laws and treaties and trample over human rights in order to teach him the&#xa0;lesson it&#xa0;feels he deserves.</p> <p>The global media is praising the \"bravery of Britain\". But the UK is a mere pawn in the imperial strategy, as are the governments of Sweden and, worse still, Australia, Assange's country of origin, which has scandalously disassociated itself from the case.</p> <p>However, there is some hope: last weekend&#xa0;an emergency meeting of the ministers of foreign relations of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded with a unanimous declaration of solidarity with Ecuador and in repudiation of the attitude of the&#xa0;British government regarding this incident. It should be noted that Unasur includes governments at either end of the political spectrum.</p> <p>David Cameron's position was so&#xa0;reprehensible that conservative leaders&#xa0;such as Chile's Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era&#xa0;and Colombia's Juan Manuel Santos as well as radical ones such as Bolivia's Evo Morales and Venezuela's Hugo Ch\u00e1vez sided with President Rafael Correa of Ecuador.</p> <p>It is a discouraging sign that the country which, in the mid-19th century,&#xa0;welcomed Karl Marx is now ready&#xa0;to deliver Assange to a country that administers the infamous Guant\u00e1namo prison camp, sends prisoners overseas in secret flights to be&#xa0;tortured elsewhere, and deprives alleged criminals of&#xa0;the most elementary right of self-defence, unable to call a lawyer or even to communicate his or her whereabouts to their family.</p>",
  "<p>This was life on Wall Street only 50 years ago: \"The secretaries all had to wear hats and gloves. In the bathrooms, they had light bulbs with the partner's [boss's] name. The partner would ring you up. If you were in the bathroom, you had to run out immediately.\"</p> <p>One question on an entrance exam paper for a trainee programme at Merrill Lynch in 1972 read: \"When you meet a woman, what interests you most about her?\" The correct answer was beauty. Low scores were given for those who answered intelligence. There was, of course, no question about what to be interested in when meeting a man.</p> <p>Yet a few dozen determined and tough women did manage to break into this world four decades ago. Now their stories are being told and analysed by Melissa Fisher, an anthropologist from New York University, in her book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wall-Street-Women-Melissa-Fisher/dp/0822353458\" title=\"\">Wall Street Women</a>. Fisher interviewed the women from the mid-90s through to the financial crisis of 2008 and the result is a compelling picture of just how far women have come \u2013 and how far they still have to go.</p> <p>Over the past year I, too, have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2012/aug/01/how-to-make-most-of-banking-blog\" title=\"\">interviewing</a>, for this newspaper, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/03/voices-of-finance-women\" title=\"\">dozens of women working in finance in London</a>. Most are under 35 and weren't even born when Fisher's informants began their careers. It is striking how much has changed in two generations.</p> <p>Today's young investment bankers have been wined and dined by the major banks and financial firms almost from the first day they set foot in their top university. None of Fisher's cohort came from prestigious institutions (Ivy League universities weren't even open to women until the late 60s) nor was there a recruitment circus. Instead, the first women bankers and brokers found their jobs by responding to newspaper ads, or through friends. Once hired, they went to business school in the evenings, where they met other women. It was this support network that helped them figure out what to wear in a meeting, what to do at a social function and how to deal with difficult or sexist bosses. \"This was before such words as 'networking', 'coaching' or 'role model' were even used,\" Fisher says.</p> <p>Forty years ago, a career in finance wasn't glamorous, lucrative or controversial. Instead, banks were seen as boring \u2013 ambitious graduates preferred the business world. Today, the starting salary for an investment banker in London is around \u00a345,000 plus bonus \u2013 making finance easily the best-paying industry for graduates. But the other side of the coin is that never in modern history has banking and finance had a worse image than now. This generation's women bankers in London say it's far harder to be a banker in society than a woman in banking.</p> <p>Institutionalised sexism in finance seems eradicated, say young women bankers, as banks and firms fear expensive lawsuits and bad publicity. But on the top floor the glass ceiling remains, with women massively underrepresented in senior positions. Not a single global bank is run by a woman.</p> <p>Virtually everyone I have interviewed says they want more women in top positions. But none is in favour of quotas, arguing that these fatally undermine women's credibility in the daily office battles and would even prove counterproductive.</p> <p>At the same time, Fisher says, the arguments for more women at the top of finance are shifting in fascinating ways. In the 70s, women gained entry into finance at the price of accepting traditional roles and norms. They played on traditional connections between femininity, motherhood and work, Fisher writes, arguing in interviews with her that being a woman made them good at analysing stocks: \"They would tell me, 'Women have a lot more respect for the concept of risk. This serves them well.'\"</p> <p>But now, after the financial crisis, a new argument is developing: might women actually be better stewards of the financial sector? Before emancipation, women were cast as too emotional and fundamentally unserious, and hence not suited for bearing heavy responsibility in society. After the crisis, it is now male traders and bankers who are portrayed in that light; driven by the emotion of greed and machismo, and slaves to the thrill of ever greater risks.</p> <p>Will this shift in public discourse affect women's chances of breaking through the remaining glass ceilings? Fisher describes in her book how women reacted with alarm and despair when, following the crisis, the three highest-ranking women on Wall Street all lost their jobs in rapid succession. A disproportionate number of lower-ranking women were culled, too.</p> <p>Fisher's book ends with mixed feelings. Looking back, the first generation is immensely proud to have made it. But they are frustrated with the tenacity of male domination, with some of the women embracing the idea of quotas. They are also frustrated with what they see as the new, more individualist generation of women in finance who don't seem as committed to take the fight to the next level, viewing their rights as \"entitlements\" instead. As one of the most successful pioneers puts it in the book: \"Some women open the door, the others walk through\".</p> <p><em>Melissa Fisher will be discussing her book and the glass ceiling in the comment thread on Monday 20 August at 8pm.</em></p> <p><em>Over the past 12 months the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog\" title=\"\">Joris Luyendijk Banking Blog</a> has interviewed dozens of women in finance in London.

  "<p>A dusty seaside car park with black folding chairs was the makeshift setting on Monday for the first parliament to sit in Somalia for more than two decades.</p> <p>About 250 MPs wearing new ID tags and, in some cases, the scent of cologne were sworn in by the chief justice on worn copies of the Qur'an in front of Somalia's national flag of a white star on sky blue background.</p> <p>It was a day that many hope will mark a new chapter after the civil war and bloodshed that followed the collapse of central government in 1991. But sceptics warn that the process is already tainted and prone to unravel.</p> <p>The inauguration was held at the main airport, one of the most heavily secured areas of the capital, Mogadishu, watched over by African Union peacekeepers in armoured Casspir personnel carriers. Just over a year after the militant Islamist group al-Shabaab was driven out of the city, suicide bombings and assassinations remain a constant threat.</p> <p>Although ordinary citizens could not vote, there was campaigning in Mogadishu, with election posters hanging on buildings and from cars, a scene scarcely imaginable when it was a war zone.</p> <p>By the end of the day, Somalia had achieved a parliament, still some way short of the final target of 275 members. There should also have been a new president and speaker but, in a transition process that has taken a year longer than the original 2011 deadline, the international community has had to lower expectations.</p> <p>For now, the oldest member of parliament, the former army general Muse Hassan, has been inaugurated as the interim speaker to oversee the political wrangling in weeks to come.</p> <p>The switch from the UN-backed leadership structure known as the transitional federal government (TFG), which ruled for eight years, to this new phase has been characterised more by selection than election.</p> <p>All the MPs vowing loyalty to the country's provisional constitution have had their names put forward by 135 traditional elders and been vetted by a technical selection committee in an attempt to ensure they are educated and gender balanced. The constitution demands that 30% of MPs are female; so far it is closer to 20%.</p> <p>The vetting process is also intended to exclude warlords, who have long been agents of chaos in the Horn of Africa country. The 27 Somalis and nine international observers on the committee said they had fended off telephone death threats and turned away brown envelopes of encouragement.</p> <p>The optimism of the moment is therefore qualified. \"It's a defining time in Somalia,\" said Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, chairman of the Peace and Development party. \"The playing field is not level and I'm not saying Somalia will get what it deserves, but it will be better than the status quo.\"</p> <p>On Sunday, two press conferences reflected the rhetoric of the process to date. An array of diplomats and UN officials painted an upbeat picture, claiming their efforts to steer Somalia's troubled transition back on course have succeeded, and brushing aside fears that there have been many false dawns before.</p> <p>\"It's going to be a qualitatively different parliament than anything you've seen before,\" said Augustine Mahiga, the UN special representative to Somalia. \"It's certainly the beginning of legitimate, representative and accountable institutions.\"</p> <p>But the Somali president, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, has accused the selection committee members of overstepping their bounds by not including those he felt should be MPs.</p> <p>As a morning drizzle fell on inauguration day, rumours of protests and security worries circulated by text message.</p> <p>UN officials confirmed a quiet meeting was held between Mahiga and the president in an attempt to smooth things over, but the uneasy truce has left a sense of trepidation on the streets of Mogadishu.</p> <p>Abdi Fatah, a former parliamentary official who is now an aid worker, said: \"We're fearing that if he doesn't win, the president won't give up his palace. And his people \u2013 his clan \u2013 may do demonstrations in the streets.\"</p> <p>Some external observers have condemned the regionally brokered and UN-backed roadmap as deeply flawed. The International Crisis Group said: \"The current political process has been as undemocratic as the one it seeks to replace, with unprecedented levels of political interference, corruption and intimidation. The end of the transition roadmap process \u2013 a that is supposed to usher in an inclusive political dispensation\u2013 may fail to bring stability.</p> <p>\"Convening an incomplete parliament and electing a contested, tainted leadership in Somalia's polarised political environment could easily unravel the painstaking humanitarian, political and security progress made in the past three years. The extremist Islamist movement al-Shabaab is down but not out, and it is evolving, and plots to take advantage of the resulting chaos to regain power.\"</p> <p>Those benefiting from the capital's economic rebirth say the flow of investment, reconstruction and good intentions is fragile, and political instability could destroy all they have achieved.</p> <p>While the composition of decision-makers in the fledgling assembly is a mix of old timers and new faces, some analysts warn it could simply perpetuate an ongoing power struggle between the TFG speaker, Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan, and the president.\u00ac</p> <p>It has turned into a numbers game. The magic number is 4.5, a formula that acknowledges the primacy of Somali clan loyalties, ensuring that the spoils of power can theoretically be divided between the four main groups \u2013 the Hawiye, Darod, Dir, and Rahaweyn \u2013 and the \"others\", an amalgamation of smaller clans.</p> <p>In coming days and weeks, the full 275-member parliament, a number divisible by 4.5, will vote for a speaker in a secret ballot, to be followed by a similar process for the presidency.</p> <p>But one new MP, Sahra Korrshell, 58, smiled with quiet pride as she explained that she had responded to the call of her clan, the Darod. She gazed over the sea of faces and reflected: \"It's a hard task ahead, but change is good. When new people come, they do things differently, and that's what Somalia needs now.\"</p>",
  "<p>Housebuilder Bovis is sitting on at least three years of plots. At current house buying activity levels, it may have more than five years' worth of plots for its mix of three to five bedroom family homes.</p> <p>They are not facing planning delays because they are all parcels of land with planning consent. Other housebuilders are in the same position. They have bought plots in the aftermath of the crash and are only slowly releasing them for building as demand allows.</p> <p>The Bovis chief executive, David Ritchie, is clear. He could build many more homes if banks were willing to grant mortgages to homebuyers who have only small deposits.</p> <p>If the UK is to build two or three million more homes to meet the pent up demand, there is obviously a debate to be had over where they should be sited.</p> <p>However, to get things started, there is no question where the barrier lies. Planning is a red herring. Credit, or the lack of it, stands in the way of demand.</p> <p>That said, housebuilders seem to want a return to the good old days before 2007 when they could pay high prices for land, build inefficiently, and then pass the cost on to the consumer while pocketing a handsome profit. That idea needs to change.</p> <p>There needs to be greater consideration of environmental measures to make new communities more sustainable and less reliant on cars.</p> <p>Bovis's focus on clutches of traditional homes on green field sites in the south exemplifies much that is wrong with the property industry. Environmental impacts are talked about in architectural circles, but dismissed by housebuilders fixated on profit and loss.</p> <p>Higher environmental standards would hit profits in the short term because land is a fixed cost and was often bought at high prices. But higher standards would quickly depress land prices, leaving Bovis no worse off and the environment enhanced. Landowners have had it easy for too long. Land taxes to encourage development and regulations to make sure it is environmentally friendly need to go alongside any credit easing.</p>",
  "<p>The Paralympics will be a celebration not only of sporting prowess, but also of the huge advances made in the emancipation of disabled people in Britain. Although there remains far to go \u2013 and there are major concerns that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/welfare\" title=\"\">coalition's welfare cuts</a> will set back those advances \u2013 that fundamental change is surely irreversible: as a leading expert puts it, the genie is out of the bottle. We are becoming accustomed to seeing disabled people in the community, in the workplace and in the media. Forty years ago, many would have been in residential care.</p> <p>Much of this has come about through the efforts and organisation of disabled people themselves. Led initially by a handful of activists, a nascent disability rights movement seized the initiative in the 1970s and began campaigning for legislative and welfare reforms that now underpin striking societal change.</p> <p>But in 2012, just as the opportunity comes to make a show of Britain's progress before a global audience, the disability movement finds itself at a crossroads \u2013 and, some say, becalmed. The leaders who emerged in the 70s and 80s have gone, or are departing, and the agenda, perhaps understandably, seems dominated by a struggle to preserve gains won.</p> <p>\"In some ways we are much closer to the 70s than to where we were in the 90s,\" said Ian Macrae, the editor of <a href=\"http://www.disabilitynow.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Disability Now magazine</a>. \"As a community we are having to fight a very particular battle [over] what the government is doing ... which is preventing us from making the wider case about why we need more in the way of independent living.</p> <p>\"We have got so completely trapped in the tunnel of argument over welfare reform that disabled people are increasingly happy to present themselves as victims. The leaders of the movement of the 80s and 90s fought [against] that tooth and nail.\"</p> <p>Some of the most influential of those leaders had shaped their views through visits to the first <a href=\"ttp://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/evans/Centres%20for%20Independent%20Living%20as%20an%20Alternative%20to%20Instit%85.pdf\" title=\"\">centres for independent living</a> in the US, where disabled students were provided with personal assistants to enable them to live in the community while at university. Their lifestyle made a profound impression on the visitors, several of whom were living in residential homes where the regimes had scarcely progressed since before the second world war.</p> <p>A letter published in the Guardian in September 1972, proposing a consumer group to represent disabled people living in institutions, is often seen as the start of the UK independent living movement, leading as it did to the creation of the <a href=\"http://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/UPIAS/UPIAS.pdf\" title=\"\">Union of Physically Impaired Against Segregation (Upias)</a> (pdf). The early 1970s were heady days on the political left and the group's founders drew parallels with the struggles for equality of women, black and gay people: Vic Finkelstein, one of its prime movers, was a psychologist with a spinal cord injury who came to the UK from South Africa as a refugee after being banned by the apartheid regime for civil rights activism.</p> <p>A second key organisation was the Disability Alliance, founded in 1974 with the goal of a comprehensive income scheme for disabled people and chaired by Peter Townsend, a leading poverty expert. A paper, titled <a href=\"http://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/UPIAS/fundamental%20principles.pdf\" title=\"\">Fundamental Principles of Disability</a>, summarising discussions in 1975 between the alliance and Upias, is regarded as the first statement of the \"social model\" of disability.</p> <p>The social model, as distinct from a medical model, treats physical or mental impairment separately from disability in the way in which disabled people are excluded from full participation in society. Finkelstein \u2013 who helped develop the idea of the social model with its prime architect, the disability academic Michael Oliver \u2013 used to describe a hypothetical village in which all the residents used wheelchairs and everything was tailored to their needs. When able-bodied visitors arrived, it was they who experienced problems and felt excluded.</p> <p>The social model became the dominant philosophy of the emerging UK disability movement after its adoption by the British Council of Organisations of Disabled People (BCODP), founded in 1981. As disability researcher and commentator Tom Shakespeare has argued, the model's importance was that it gave the movement a strategy \u2013 barrier removal \u2013 and it replaced in the minds of disabled people the idea that they were in some way deficient with the notion that they were in fact oppressed.</p> <p>The effect was liberating. \"They didn't have to be sorry for themselves: rather, they could be angry,\" he wrote in his book Disability Rights and Wrongs. \"Rather than a demeaning reliance on charity, disabled activists could now demand their rights.\" Such demands were given practical form initially by centres for independent living. The first were founded in Hampshire and Derbyshire in 1984, although some universities \u2013 notably Oxford, Essex, Southampton and Cardiff \u2013 had already been developing US-style schemes whereby disabled students shared accommodation with others without disabilities who provided support and assistance.</p> <p>Funding for those starting to live independently came from enlightened local councils, acting at the time with dubious legal authority, and a social security benefit called the domestic care allowance. When the government set out to withdraw the allowance in 1986, triggering outrage, the resulting campaign was the first indication of the gathering strength of the disability movement. Within a year, ministers had announced the <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/ilf/\" title=\"\">independent living fund,</a> a state-funded quango to award discretionary grants worth hundreds of pounds a week to disabled people to live in the community. The bigger prize, however, was a legitimised and universal system of <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/Disabledpeople/DG_10018721\" title=\"\">direct payments by councils</a>. The BCODP began to campaign for this in 1989. The statute took effect in the last days of the Major administration in 1997.</p> <p>That a Tory government passed the measures was highly significant: the idea resonated well with Conservative principles of individualism and self-determination. Under Labour, in a subtle switch of tactics, the disability movement deployed a human rights argument to sustain the case for disabled people having greater choice and control over their lives. Indeed, \"choice and control\" have been watchwords espoused by politicians of all hues since the mid-90s.</p> <p>The focus shifted under Labour to equality of opportunity and equality before the law, following the landmark legislation passed towards the end of the Tory government in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/50/contents\" title=\"\">Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995</a> \u2013 which for the first time required employers and providers of services to help disabled people by making \"reasonable adjustments\" that would remove barriers to their access and participation.</p> <p>For an employer, this might mean varying a job specification to take account of a person's disability or providing adapted equipment, such as desk or chair. For a retailer, it means making \"reasonable\" arrangements for disabled shoppers to be served: not just providing step-free access where possible, but ensuring someone is available, for instance, to assist a blind person who requests help.</p> <p>The DDA was amended and strengthened in 2005, imposing a duty on public bodies to promote equality. It was superseded, except in Northern Ireland, by the <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/legal-and-policy/equality-act/\" title=\"\">Equality Act 2010</a>, which consolidated all anti-discrimination legislation in a statutory mirror of the <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/\" title=\"\">Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)</a>. Since 2007 the commission has combined the advisory and watchdog functions of formerly separate equalities bodies including the Disability Rights Commission.</p> <p>Many lament the passing of the DRC, which Labour had set up in 2000. Bob Niven, who was its chief executive, said: \"Having a joined-up commission has not been as good as disabled people would have hoped; most people would say it has not lived up to expectations. Of course there are similarities [across all groups at risk of discrimination] but I think the experience of being totally blind is not comparable with any other experience; having serious mental health difficulties is different from anything else.\"</p> <p>Niven is nonetheless convinced that the position of disabled people in Britain is markedly improved. \"It's very different than 10 or 15 years ago in terms of access to buildings, trains and public spaces, employment opportunities and application of technology. And it's much, much better in terms of public attitudes.\" Richard Howitt, Labour MEP for the east of England and vice-chair of the disability group in the European parliament, says the UK lags behind some other countries in meeting special educational needs, and that too many disabled people still live segregated lives. But he considers it to be out in front on non-discrimination. \"If you had to go to court and say you had been treated less than fairly, Britain would probably be the place to do it,\" he said. For Frances Hasler, a leading figure in the social care sector who has worked closely with the disability movement, the acid test is public transport. \"Every time I see a wheelchair user waiting at a bus stop in London, that gives me pleasure,\" she said. \"You can't turn that kind of thing back. You can't stick the genie back in the bottle. There is a lot of doom and gloom at the moment, but overall there has been a massive move forward. Although deinstitutionalisation is not yet complete, it's pretty mainstream. The idea that young disabled people don't belong back in institutions is certainly well embedded.\"</p> <p>All agree that there remains much to do. Disabled people continue to suffer persistent disadvantage in almost all aspects of life: <a href=\"http://www.poverty.org.uk/40/index.shtml\" title=\"\">one in three live in poverty</a>; <a href=\"http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/docs/res/factsheets/b1-disability-employment-factsheet-employment-rates.pdf\" title=\"\">one in two of working age are unemployed</a>; and older teenagers are <a href=\"http://testsandexams.qcda.gov.uk/libraryAssets/media/Briefing_sheet_one_introducing_the_DDA_act.pdf\" title=\"\">twice as likely as their non-disabled counterparts not to be in education, employment or training</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/aug/14/disability-hate-crime-increase-reported-incidents-data\" title=\"\">Hate crime has become a serious issue</a>, with recorded incidents growing by 60% between 2009 and 2011.</p> <p>Yet just as the disability movement needs fresh impetus, there is a seeming crisis of leadership and direction. Many of the movement's leaders have gone or are, by their own admission, burnt out. Where will the new generation come from?</p> <p>Some argue that, as talented young disabled people can now enjoy rewarding careers, they have little time for campaigning: <a href=\"http://www.radar.org.uk/publications/doing-seniority-differently/\" title=\"\">research by the charity Radar in 2009</a>, though far from exhaustive, traced 110 disabled \"high flyers\" earning \u00a380,000-plus salaries.</p> <p>Another suggestion is that a sense of complacency may have set in after the remarkable gains of the 1990s. Macrae said: \"After the DDA, a lot of people, including some of the activists, said: 'That's it, we have got what we want now.' They stopped protesting, stopped saying, 'This is not enough.' A lot of the spirit and a lot of the anger went out of the movement.\"</p> <p>Anger is certainly evident now, in reaction to the coalition's disability benefit changes, and much of it is being expressed by new grassroots networks of disabled people linked by social media. But there is a frustration among veterans of past struggles that they have been drawn into an agenda not of their choosing and are having to fight a rearguard action to try to preserve entitlements. Some are seeking to regain the initiative.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/rethinking-disability-policy\" title=\"\">recent paper for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a>, Jenny Morris, who was a disability policy adviser to the Labour government, has argued that disabled people need to instigate and lead a wider debate about the nature and purpose of the welfare state, applying to it the concept of reasonable adjustments that lies at the heart of the DDA, and thereby challenging the creeping prejudice that benefit payments are merely a drain on the economy.</p> <p>Liz Sayce, chief executive of the charity Disability Rights UK, which now incorporates Radar and the Disability Alliance, believes there are significant issues \u2013 potential \"quick wins\" \u2013 that could be taken up even at a time of austerity. These include campaigning for the <a href=\"http://odi.dwp.gov.uk/odi-projects/fulfilling-potential.php\" title=\"\">government's forthcoming disability strategy</a> to have real teeth, and exposing the failure of Whitehall departments to work together on disability issues; ensuring ministers fulfil their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/14/mental-health-bars-mp-removed\" title=\"\">promise to overturn the ban on jury service for people with a mental disorder</a> and to scrap the legal provisions that can have them stripped of company directorships, and pressing for tougher action against negative portrayals of disabled people in the media.</p> <p>Sayce is more sanguine than others about the emergence of new, young leaders of the disability movement. Some 450 people have been through leadership programmes initiated by Radar and the charity established a network of high flyers, <a href=\"http://www.radiate-net.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Radiate</a>, with the support of Lloyds bank. Her Radar predecessor Kate Nash has gone on to help establish <a href=\"http://www.katenashassociates.com/home\" title=\"\">networks of disabled employees</a> in more than 220 companies and public bodies including Lloyds, BT and the houses of parliament.</p> <p>\"Many of these people won't become leaders in the classic, activist sense,\" said Sayce. \"But we shouldn't forget those who are leading opinion in different ways, across all sorts of sectors. Twenty or 30 years ago, there simply wouldn't have been disabled people in these positions.\"</p> <p>The disability movement faces a further, more fundamental question about its future direction, however. Shakespeare has come to the conclusion that for all the strengths of the social model of disability as a campaign umbrella, by adopting it uncritically in the 1980s and adhering rigidly to an unchanging interpretation of it since, the movement has taken a wrong turn. The importance of people's individual and shared impairments has been played down; the potential of medical intervention and advance has been dismissed; and the disability community has turned inward and failed to make alliances with other groups in society, he said.</p> <p>Shakespeare threw down his challenge in his book in 2006, calling for a reappraisal of strategy to galvanise disabled people once again. \"Since 2000, the disability movement in Britain appears to have stagnated,\" he wrote. \"Despite important and progressive changes in wider society, the politics of disability seem to have run out of steam.\" Six years on, his challenge remains.</p>",
  "<p>America's worst drought in half a century will push up inflation and put a fresh obstacle in the path of the struggling global economy, one of the UK's leading banks has warned.</p> <p>Senior global economist at HSBC, Karen Ward, said sharp rises in the cost of wheat, corn and soya beans came when growth was slowing but said the weakness of wage pressure meant there was no need for central banks to raise interest rates in response to a higher cost of living.</p> <p>Blistering heat in the US has destroyed 45% of the corn and 35% of the soya bean crop in the worst harvest since 1988. Russia and Ukraine have also had poor crop yields. Ward said higher food prices would result.</p> <p>\"This is another dampener for the global economy at a time when the headwinds are already acute,\" Ward said. She added that workers were unlikely to press for higher wages to compensate for dearer food at a time when labour markets were softening and this would allow policy makers to ignore the increase in inflation as an external shock.</p> <p>\"Even if prices stabilise at these levels, we are likely to see headline inflation rates rise across the world in the coming months, particularly in the emerging economies where food accounts for a larger proportion of household spending. Latin America is more susceptible than Asia, where rice is the more common staple. So far rice prices remain subdued.</p> <p>According to the HSBC report, relatively high stocks of grain could be run down to meet demand until new harvests were reaped in unaffected parts of the world. \"But much depends on government behaviour. With memories of Haiti's 2008 food riots and the Arab spring (where high food prices played a part) still fresh, panic buying by governments and/or export bans would only exacerbate the problem and may cause social unrest.\"</p>",

  "<p>Rock band Green Day is starring in a new episode of the Angry Birds Friends game on Facebook: the latest big-name partnership for developer Rovio following previous deals with 20th Century Fox, NASA and the Philadelphia Eagles.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.greenday.com/angrybirds\">Green Day episode</a> comprises 10 levels in the Facebook game, including pig characters based on the three band members: Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool. The band's new single Oh Love features in the game, alongside an additional, exclusive track called Troublemaker.</p> <p>More music and levels will follow later in the Autumn, as Green Day release three albums \u2013&nbsp;Uno, Dos and Tre \u2013&nbsp;in four months.</p> <p>It's the first time Rovio has worked with a music artist in this way, although the company's chief executive Mikael Hed was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/jan/30/angry-birds-music-midem\">mooting such partnerships</a> at the Midem music industry conference in January 2012.</p> <p>Rovio's marketing chief Peter Vesterbacka explained the partnership to The Guardian. \"We have been contacted by a lot of different music artists for areas like co-promotions, and we have talked to lots of labels,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We had been looking to give the pigs a more prominent role in the games, and when we started talking to [label] Warner and the Green Day management, we realised it was a very good fit.\"</p> <p>For now, the levels will only be available in the Facebook game, rather than the iOS and Android versions of Angry Birds Friends. Vesterbacka hinted that the partnership may extend to mobile devices in the future, though.</p> <p>\"We haven't announced anything besides the Facebook stuff that is live now, but we view this as a first step in a much bigger co-operation,\" he said. \"Our fans and Green Day's fans should expect more of the same surprise and delight. We always want to surprise people!\"</p> <p>Vesterbacka is keen to describe this as a two-way partnership, rather than one brand piggybacking on the other.</p> <p>\"For us, it's bringing Angry Birds to more people, and it's the same thing for Green Day, bringing their music to a new audience,\" he said, noting that Green Day have sold 70m albums, and have notched up 25m Likes for their Facebook profile.</p> <p>\"That's 4m more than we have, so they are pretty big! A lot of people that play Angry Birds haven't listened to Green Day before, and a lot of fans of Green Day haven't played Angry Birds before. On both sides, we want to expand the fanbase and expose more people to Angry Birds and Green Day, so it's a very good fit. It's two big green brands...\"</p> <p>Rovio's last publicly-announced milestone for the Angry Birds games was 1bn total downloads back in May 2012, although Vesterbacka says the company is now focusing more on its drive to get to \"1bn fans\" of its franchise across games, animation and other products.</p> <p>\"People often think I'm joking when I say we're only getting started, but that's still our perspective,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We have some pretty interesting other things in the pipeline for this year, and we're slowly getting to where we ought to be: making Angry Birds a pop culture phenomenon.\"</p>",
  "<p>Biodiversity conservation has changed in recent years. In the old days things were straightforward. Conservationists identified what they wanted to preserve: a species, a habitat, a grand scenic view, and then they lobbied government to get it protected. Lawmakers then created red-lists, nature reserves and national parks with strict conditions about access and use. But there are two key problems with this approach. Enforcing laws is expensive, and restricting access often denies the poorest and most marginalised. New approaches adopt sustainability principles in which environmental protection must go hand in hand with economic and social goals.</p> <p>But how does this work in practice? Professor Jon Lovett, who is taking up a new post with the University of Leeds, has just completed a three year project in the La Primavera Biosphere reserve in Mexico <a href=\"http://darwin.defra.gov.uk/featured-project/2012-07-17027/\" title=\"\">funded by the UK Darwin Initiative</a> working closely with the reserve's management authority, local universities including the <a href=\"http://portal.iteso.mx/\" title=\"\">Universidad Jesuita de Guadalajara</a>, Mexican NGOs and agricultural land-owning community groups, called 'ejidos'.</p> <p>Integrating the interests of many different groups is challenging: the ejidos need financially viable land use, the conservation groups want as much nature protected as possible, and the management authority is caught in the middle. The project first brought all the groups together to express their views, then set about estimating the reserve's ecosystem service values and working out some way of paying the ejidos for conservation efforts on their land.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&amp;code=MEX+24\" title=\"\">La Primavera</a> is on an old volcano right next to the city of Guadalajara and is covered by oak pine forests. Guadalajara is growing rapidly and La Primavera is getting cut off from other forests, such as that on the nearby Tequila Volcano and Sierra de Quila, by roads and urban expansion. The forest was home to big cats like the puma, but the last one was shot in the 70s. Then, in 2009, about 30 years after the last direct evidence of pumas in the area, camera traps were set up throughout the forest by researchers from a local NGO, Aura Jaguar, and a few months later yielded pictures of a graceful puma.</p> <p>To get more evidence of the puma I contacted an old friend, Sam Wasser, who has a team of 'conservation canines', dogs trained to search for dung of carnivores, which can then be identified by the DNA they contain. One of his PhD students, Jen White, was working in Mexico on jaguars and she came over to La Primavera with her dog Scooby. They spent a week scouring the forest but DNA analysis revealed only bobcats; recent rains had deteriorated DNA traces in many samples for which results were inconclusive. The puma was obviously still very rare and corridors were needed to connect La Primavera to the other nearby forests.</p> <p>Land in Mexico can be commonly or privately owned. Most of the land for potential corridors is owned communally by ejidos and is used for livestock ranching but there are also pressures for farming, either for food crops or the agave plant, which is the basis of tequila production. If land use is switched to wildlife corridors, then forest owners will need to be compensated, and the money has to come from somewhere.</p> <p>Concern over the economic impact of human interference with the Earth's climate means that the natural ability of trees to sequester and store the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide gives them a monetary value for the carbon they contain. So we explored ways of making a monetary link between the carbon dioxide emitted by people in Guadalajara and tree planting and forest conservation. Then we had a stroke of good fortune.</p> <p>The La Primavera management office put us in in touch with <a href=\"http://www.selvanegra.com/\" title=\"\">Selva Negra</a>, the environmental NGO of <a href=\"http://www.mana.com.mx/en\" title=\"\">the rock band Man\u00e1</a> who were just about to start a world tour promoting their new album Drama y Luz and were looking for a way to offset the tour's carbon emissions. This Grammy award winning band are famous throughout Latin America, but originate from Guadalajara and were keen on supporting a local project for the city. Moreover they were able to meet with the president of Mexico, helping to secure inclusion of the project within existing environmental programmes.</p> <p>Negotiations were held with the ejido of Ahuisculco located in one of the biological corridors connecting La Primavera to Sierra de Quila to create a conservation and reforestation project. The project was designed for a 10-year period and will provide the resources to conserve more than 1000 hectares of forest and reforest more than 100 hectares. The third pillar of sustainability is that of social development: money on its own is not enough, the community needs to be supported as a whole.</p> <p>Selva Negra is creating an integrated strategy to promote local development, not only focusing on the commodification of carbon offsets, but also working with local universities on a community project to manage domestic wastes and wastewater, and to monitor water quality in wells and streams. Furthermore Selva Negra and the universities are consulting on the opening a high school education centre in the community \u2013 at present students need to go to other cities or just quit school. The plan involves investing an estimated \u00a3500,000.</p> <p>The project therefore has a triple win: biodiversity conservation by strategically extending the forest creating wildlife corridors for the puma and other animals; economic sustainability by linking the producer and consumer of an ecosystem service; and social sustainability by creating community health and education initiatives.</p> <p>However, it is not easy. We did a great deal of research into the best ways of making the payments and there needed to be lots of negotiations with the Ahuisculco ejido. We were also fortunate to build up partnerships with Selva Negra and Man\u00e1. The next stage will be to work out a way for the citizens of Guadalajara, or any city, to pay for the ecosystem services they consume, putting conservation of the planet's life support systems on a firmer footing.</p> <p><em>Jon Lovett is project coordinator and professor of Global Challenges at the University of Leeds.

  "<p>Well, that didn't last long, did it? The victory parades have barely begun, and already the midsummer dream is rudely shattered. No more talk of herculean efforts to win gold, no more hammering of iron rings of fire, no more warm fuzzy feelings towards our national broadcaster.</p> <p>No, it's back to being depicted as a nation of slack-jawed lummoxes incapable of a decent day's work, and to Iain Duncan Smith accusing the BBC's economics editor Stephanie Flanders of&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/19/iain-duncan-smith-bias-bbc\" title=\"\">\"peeing all over British industry\"</a>, after she failed to greet falling unemployment figures with unquestioning wonderment. So much for the legacy.</p> <p>In fairness to the five Tory MPs who first pricked the bubble, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/17/tory-backbenchers-urge-welfare-reforms?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">via leaked excerpts from their forthcoming book</a> arguing that we're not the nation of champions we had giddily begun imagining but \"among the worst idlers of the world\", this wasn't quite the plan.</p> <p>Perhaps provocative references in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Britannia-Unchained-Global-Lessons-Prosperity/dp/1137032235\" title=\"\">Britannia Unchained</a> to people preferring \"a lie in to hard work\" will look less inflammatory in context, or at least in season (the book's due out in September, traditional month of noses back to grindstones and party conference tub-thumping). But still, the politics of idleness deserves unpicking.</p> <p>Here's a test: does the word \"idle\", when used by politicians, instinctively set alarm bells ringing? If so, you're probably left of centre, because it's an indisputably Tory buzzword \u2013 reeking of Norman Tebbit's father <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newsvideo/7858570/Norman-Tebbit-my-father-got-on-his-bike-to-look-for-a-job.html\" title=\"\">getting on his bike </a>and rightwing tabloids haranguing welfare \"scroungers\", stirring in leftwing breasts the old fear of attack on the vulnerable.</p> <p>But if it's that word \"vulnerable\" which gets your hackles up then you're probably right of centre, because vulnerability is a Labour buzzword \u2013 reeking for you of excuses to do nothing, of lily-livered bleating about why the welfare state couldn't possibly be reformed which ultimately traps those it purports to protect. You probably cheered when Eric Pickles ditched the term \"vulnerable families\" (Whitehall speak for impoverished families with multiple social problems) for \"problem families\", saying it was time to stop making excuses. For the right, the word \"vulnerable\" smacks of victimhood, of ducking blame and not holding individuals accountable for their actions.</p> <p>Because that's really the difference between \"vulnerable\" and \"idle\". The first suggests that being broke or desperate is at least partly to do with external circumstances, which may need help to overcome; the second suggests it's your own dumb fault. \"Vulnerable\" resonates for those who believe in the transformative power of the state; \"idle\" for those who believe in the power of individuals.</p> <p>And what's giving the politics of idleness a new lease of life is the marriage of an ancient Tory belief \u2013 that anyone can haul themselves up by their bootstraps, that failure means you're not trying hard enough \u2013 with a newly fashionable argument about the decline of the decadent west and rise of the industrious east.</p> <p>The young Tory turks are busy weaving a narrative not just of individual moral failing (too many workshy scroungers) but of national degeneration: a sense that we've been spoiled by&#xa0;years of easy money and need a collective kick up the backside. It's intimately connected to austerity politics, with its inference that only rich countries can afford to go this soft.</p> <p>The idea that developed nations have grown fat and lazy with prosperity, and that only the children of hungry tiger economies still understand the value of hard graft, is quietly embedding itself in political culture. Think Michael Gove raiding Singapore's education system for ideas on toughening up exams; or even the Indian steel magnate Ratan Tata, complaining last year that his company's western workers were overfond of their leisure and blaming <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/Ratan-Tata-slams-Corus-JLR-managers-work-ethics/Article1-700349.aspx\" title=\"\">\"a certain comfort level that comes from a country that has had good times\"</a>. (Tata is shortly to retire but says at 75 his life's work won't be done, a sentiment of which the Britannia Unchained quintet would doubtless approve.)</p> <p>It's not clear yet exactly who these pampered slackers supposedly dragging Britain down are, beyond familiar vague complaints of a bloated public sector and kids \"more interested in pop music and football\" than in becoming lawyers. Perhaps inevitably, they exist now more in the realm of anecdote \u2013 the intern who thinks she's above making the coffee, young men scorning the menial jobs subsequently snapped up by immigrants \u2013 than hard fact.</p> <p>And while Britain does, as the book's authors say, have unusually short average working hours, that's mainly because we have an unusually high percentage of part-timers, many of whom want fulltime work but can't find it. (Those working fulltime still do some of the longest hours in Europe.) Perhaps all those frantically juggling part-time mothers of small children \u2013 the ones who a generation ago wouldn't have worked at all \u2013 are to be deemed lazy? But there's a bigger problem with the politics of idleness than quibbling over definitions.</p> <p>Hauling ourselves out of recession might indeed be as easy as demanding everyone pull their socks up, if declining GDP really was just a fancy name for indolence.</p> <p>But the many dull technical reasons why value of output per worker might fall \u2013 from the shrinking of highly productive sectors like the City to the rise of self-employed freelances commanding a lower hourly rate than they did as staffers \u2013 aren't solved by simply clocking up more hours. Our challenges are not those of tiger economies, suggesting their recipe of working harder for longer for less won't necessarily work miracles here.</p> <p>Yet for exploring this complicated new reality in her Newsnight report, Flanders was accused by the work and pensions secretary of \"carping and moaning\", running down an \"incredibly robust\" private sector. It's apparently fine to call individuals lazy, but not to suggest any flaw in modern labour markets.</p> <p>And perhaps that's partly because doing the latter suggests we may be vulnerable (that word again) to global economic trends beyond our immediate control \u2013 trends not so easily reversed by the classic Tory formula now being touted for unleashing our inner tiger, namely slashing employment regulations and cutting benefits. Idle, or vulnerable? The story we believe&#xa0;about&#xa0;ourselves has wider implications than we think.</p>",

  "<p>I had intended to open this polemic with some version of this true story: earlier this summer, I was having dinner with friends and our conversation turned to the role of the veil in Islam, starting with how to explain a burkha to a son raised to believe that men and women are equal, before leading into the veil's potential as a form of oppression against women.</p> <p>The friends I was having dinner with were two women, one a Palestinian raised in Jordan, the other English raised as a Muslim, and as our conversation progressed, it turned into how - for a number of reasons, some of them perhaps very good - it is far easier for them to discuss the issue of the veil publicly than me, a white western male, no matter how nuanced or well-intentioned my views.</p> <p>Now, this is exactly the kind of thing I want to talk about today: the things we disallow ourselves to discuss. But a funny thing happened. I found myself drafting and re-drafting the way I opened with that anecdote again and again and again, working so hard to make sure my role in that conversation was clearly understood - and therefore impossible to misunderstand - that I found myself pounding the sentences into such painfully careful neutrality that they would end up meaning almost nothing.</p> <p>But why? Why did I obviously think such care necessary, even while being painfully aware of the irony of this being a polemic about censorship?</p> <p>Part of my hesitation is of course my own genuine impulse not to be in any way racist, a truly held wish to accommodate cultures and views not my own. There is also my desire not to have this polemic be just another tediously calculated controversy, like the ones <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/18/martin-amis-england-moral-decrepitude\">Martin Amis seems to pull out</a> every time <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/12/martin-amis-katie-price-lionel-asbo\">he's got a new paperback on the way</a>.</p> <p>But if I'm honest, isn't part of it also fear? Fear of having whatever I'd say about the Islamic veil - no matter how thoughtfully I'd said it - misappropriated, misquoted or badly paraphrased in the inevitable tweeting that's going on right this very second? Fear of having my words turned into something they aren't, and having to suffer the consequences.<br>Anti-Censorship arts poster<br>Because the price of being misunderstood is very high. In the online world, nothing can be unsaid and nothing is off the record. And once you're forced, fairly or not, to start saying something like, \"I'm not a racist,\" haven't you lost the legitimacy of your voice forever? Is that something a writer can risk?</p> <p>What I've done, though, by being so careful, by even perhaps keeping silent on this or any issue, is disallowed myself a real voice in the conversation. I who consider myself a brave writer, one unafraid to push boundaries, to speak truth to power, I who believe these things about myself as much as any of you, I have in this instance self-censored. In a polemic about self-censorship.</p> <p>And my argument to you today is that, paradoxically, this form of where every voice is heard. What we disallow ourselves to discuss - sometimes for good reason, yes, but sometimes for bad - can curtail our voices as effectively as any government or corporation ever could.</p> <p>Now, the larger issue of censorship, by those very governments and corporations, is still obviously a huge one. But what I've faced with this polemic is what Mary McCarthy grappled with in 1962 when she delivered it. She said, \"I imagine it has occurred to the audience ... that there is not going to be much problem with today's topic as there can't be too much disagreement.\"</p> <p>Fifty years later, she's still right. I could easily have given an impassioned 15-minute talk about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2012/apr/16/china-censorship-internet-freedom\">China's censorship of the internet</a>, for example. Or how <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/sep/29/banned-books-week\">book-banning in schools remains a persistent problem in the US</a>, even in 2012. I could have spoken of the hate tweets to Tom Daley or Louise Mensch or Fabrice Muamba. Or the disgrace of the Pussy Riot trial in Moscow. Or Great Britain's own problems with censorship: its outdated libel laws, its alarming flair for super-injunctions, its plans for secret courts, and on and on.</p> <p>Censorship has not left the world. It only finds new avenues.</p> <p>But as in 1962, these are all easy things to rise in opposition to, without much risk, without possibly even disagreement. Would we agree here today that Salman Rushdie has the right to produce The Satanic Verses? Would we agree that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/24/salman-rushdie-jaipur-festival-cancel\">his recent experience during the Jaipur Literary Festival</a> is a depressing blow against free speech?</p> <p>There might be a few dissenters, but I suspect on the whole, we'd rally around Rushdie, and loudly - and proudly - claim our right and willingness to speak on any issue at any time.</p> <p>But would we be correct?</p> <p>Ask yourself, truthfully, would you sit down tomorrow morning and start writing a novel with Mohammad as your central character? A Mohammad treated as a fallible man rather than a prophet? A Mohammad perhaps even criticised?</p> <p>This is a different question than should you be able to write this book. Because I suspect, again, that we would probably agree here in this room - if perhaps less so in the world at large - that of course you should, if the need to tell that story was great enough. But who here actually would?</p> <p>Or consider something more benign, at least on the surface. However ashamed you might be to admit it, has the threat of a <a href=\"http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/badsex.html\">Bad Sex Award</a> ever made you pause while writing a sex scene? It's entered my mind, and<br>frankly, it pissed me off. I wrote the scene anyway, of course, but even the thought that I'd momentarily hesitated made me angry.</p> <p>For the record, I loathe the Bad Sex Award. I think it started as a funny idea, but in order to gain headlines and get writers like Haruki Murakami on the list, the otherwise intelligent people who - I hesitate to say \"judge\" it - have to temporarily pretend they understand neither context nor tone. So rather than what the Bad Sex Award could be - a discussion on how sex can be written honestly - it is instead an occasion for tittering and humiliation of the most public school kind.</p> <p>However, having said that, have I now guaranteed that every bit of sex I might ever write will automatically be scrutinised by the Bad Sex Award? Does that enter my mind before both writing a sex scene or criticising the Award itself? Do I have to make the conscious decision not to self-censor rather than write freely, as an artist should?</p> <p>What about if you're here today, among what is probably - correct me if I'm wrong - a fairly politically liberal gathering. What if you're here in this group, and you believe deeply in the freedoms I argue for: freedom of speech, the battle against censorship.</p> <p>But what if you're also, say, against abortion? For you, it's a moral position you can't budge, no matter how socially liberal you otherwise consider yourself to be. In your heart, you believe abortion to be the taking of a life. Would you venture to speak that opinion here? Would you write a work of art that espoused that opinion?</p> <p>Now, this is interesting, because I suspect you might not. But what if you did? What if you expressed that opinion here in a thoughtful but clear way? That opinion would have consequences, wouldn't it?</p> <p>We'd like to pretend it wouldn't. I imagine we here think of ourselves as open-minded and accommodating to points of view other than our own, but how would an anti-abortion writer be received in a group like this? Politely, respectfully, I'd imagine. But within that politeness, would that writer's opinions on other topics be ignored because some of us would secretly think he or she is \"not one of us, not really\"?</p> <p>Because this is the other self-censoring problem growing with the interconnectedness of the world. Instead of bringing us all together in an omnipresent, multi-faceted discussion, the internet instead has made sectarianism an almost default position. The nature of mass debate has become solely binary: you're on one side or the other. Factor that in with whatever combination of debates you've been forced to take sides on, and the number of people willing to listen to you - because they agree with you - shrinks daily. Try stating a strong opinion on gun control, for example, on Twitter and see how many followers you lose.</p> <p>That's not the only example. This polemic is going on the Guardian website, and though no one really wants to say so out loud, most of us seem to accept these days that the comments on the Guardian on articles like this, while occasionally containing interesting replies, are far more often the domain of outraged point-missers, incandescently furious pedants, and trolls who don't bother reading past the sub-headline.</p> <p>And again, did I pause about whether to include that paragraph, knowing this article will have comments beneath it? I did. More importantly, have I, by all that frankly liberating name-calling, just committed the same crime myself by dismissing any discussion I find unpalatable?</p> <p>Because this is the kind of risk you run by saying something like that opinion about abortion. We here would almost certainly argue for your right to hold it, but in this sectarian, connected world, we'd then maybe stop listening to you. In a way, you'd be suddenly free of censorship because you'd be able to say whatever you like, you'd just be saying it to fewer and fewer people. And importantly, you'd be left out of conversations you'd like to be having.</p> <p>Can an artist do this? Should an artist? Certainly, there are artists who are happy to talk to their own small sect in exchange for complete freedom to say whatever they will. But isn't the pushing of an artist into a small sect also a kind of censorship? And if chosen by the artist, isn't it a kind of self-exile? Of giving up on engaging? Of possibly even changing things because you're no longer part of a discussion that might?</p> <p>For example, if you're a writer who wants to affect the world and engage with a large audience, would you risk being marginalised in the US by talking about your atheism? Would you risk the same marginalisation in England by talking about your devout Christianity?</p> <p>Would you loudly proclaim a pro-Israeli position in Europe? Or a pro-Palestinian one in the US? Or go anywhere in the world and suggest Israel and Palestine may both have dirty hands?</p> <p>Now, of course there's a natural elision between what we say in private versus what we say in public, but in a time where everything you say is now said to the entire world, are there areas where you've allowed that elision to justify not speaking what you see as the truth to save yourself from the consequences that could result?</p> <p>How does an artist speak freely in this environment? I don't have a simple credo that answers this. I press on, I try hard, I work to say what I want to say in a way that keeps my voice both heard but also truthful, also standing up for what I believe in the most effective way I can. But I don't always get it right, I don't always make myself proud, and most importantly, I find that the struggle grows daily in the way the world now connects.</p> <p>And so I ask you today, what do you not say? What do you censor when you write? Because I'm afraid I can't believe that you don't. You may be willing to do some of the things I've mentioned today, but all?</p> <p>I like to think of myself as a fearless writer, and I'm sure that you all do, too. But are we really challenging ourselves enough to keep that true?</p> <p>I don't think the question behind censorship today is any longer should you be able to say these things. Nor is it even a question so much anymore of if you <em>can</em>. The question has become, if you <em>do</em>.</p> <p>\u2022 The <a href=\"http://www.edinburghworldwritersconference.org/\">Edinburgh World Writers' conference</a>, hosted jointly by the Edinburgh International Book festival and the British Council, runs from 17-21 August, with contributions from Ali Smith, Irvinw Welsh, China Mi\u00e9ville and Patrick Ness</p>",

  "<p>The chief executive of the Mongolian stock exchange sits in a beige office behind an old PC, his BlackBerry ringing incessantly. Although Altai Khangai is only 31, his hair shows traces of gray; he wears a pink-striped shirt and designer glasses. \"I think the exchange will bring a fundamental change to Mongolia,\" he says in between sips of coffee. \"It will transform Mongolia.\"</p> <p>Located in a former children's cinema on Sukhbator Square in the centre of Ulan Bator, the Mongolian stock exchange (MSE) was opened in 1993 as a way to privatise government-owned assets after almost 70 years of Soviet rule. It originally had 30 brokers and was open for two hours a week.</p> <p>Times have changed. The MSE recently completed a three-year, $14m (\u00a38.9m) partnership with the London Stock Exchange, and installed a top-of-the-line brokering software system called Millennium IT, considered the best in the world.</p> <p>It was the world's top performing stock exchange in 2010; last year it was number two, after Venezuela. \"Some strange things take place in Mongolia, but things are improving and we're progressing,\" Altai said.</p> <p>Driving progress at the MSE is the recent discovery of vast mineral deposits in the Mongolian hinterlands, some of which found their way into the medals awarded at the Olympic Games in London. Last year, Mongolia's economy grew by 17.3%, the fastest rate in Asia and almost double that of China, one \u2013 with Russia \u2013 of its two vast immediate neighbours.</p> <p>If you were going to develop a commodity supply source anywhere \u2013 even today, when global commodity prices have taken a dip \u2013 it would be in this former Soviet satellite right next to China, the most resource-hungry market in the world.</p> <p>The boom in Mine-golia, as some are now dubbing it, has arrived courtesy of a wave of investment from foreign firms wanting to get their hands on copper, coal and rare earth minerals.</p> <p>The US group Nova Mining Corporation recently said it planned to build a railway line from Mongolia to the Chinese coast as a way to ship supplies of lithium needed to meet demand from Apple for new iPhones. Lithium is a key ingredient in long-life batteries for phones and electric cars and Nova is close to an exclusive deal to tie up supplies from the Mongolian National Mining consultants.</p> <p>Other mining projects include the Tavan Tolgoi opencast coal facility in the southern Gobi region. Tavan Tolgoi has estimated reserves of as much as 7.5bn tonnes of coal, including the world's largest untapped deposit of coking coal, which is used to make steel. Output from Tavan and elsewhere is expected to grow from a current level of about 16m tonnes a year to as much as 240m by 2040, according to some estimates.</p> <p>Also coming online is the Oyu Tolgoi, a vast source of copper and gold in the southern Gobi that sits just 50 miles north of the Chinese border. The mine is ultimately controlled by the London-based mining group Rio Tinto, and is expected to start production in the next few months after $6bn of investment \u2013 the largest single investment in Mongolian history.</p> <h2>Problematic Chinese relationship</h2> <p>\"Economists estimate that the Mongolian economy will be more than a third larger in 2019 because of Oyu Tolgoi (OT),\" said a spokesman at Rio's London head office. \"Beyond the mine itself, OT is driving the biggest revolution in infrastructure building ever in the South Gobi, constructing roads, an airport, and power lines that will supply local towns with 24-hour electricity for the first time. We are sponsoring the largest vocational training programme in Mongolia's history, educating 3,300 of Mongolia's future workforce in professions as diverse as accountancy, IT and environmental management.\"</p> <p>But all this foreign involvement and a growing relationship with China is not without its problems. Nor is the domestic political situation entirely stable, with the former prime minister having been jailed for four years last month for corruption and a new leader, Norov Altankhuyag, from the Democratic party, confirmed in office only nine days ago.</p> <p>The current government is opposing a near-$1bn bid from Aluminium Corporation of China (Chalco) for SouthGobi Resources, a business with coalmining interests in Mongolia.</p> <p>Last week Alex Molyneux, the chief executive of SouthGobi, said the government had made the deal \"impossible\" and he believed the Chinese had dropped their interest, although they have until 4 September to formalise their bid.</p> <p>An expected stock market flotation by Tavan Tolgoi, expected for both the Mongolian and London stock exchanges, was recently put back from this year to early 2013 for reasons many attribute to political interference.</p> <p>The path of progress has never been a straight line at the local exchange. In the early 1990s, the MSE gave each Mongolian citizen a small packet of pink and blue coupons, which they could use to bid for shares in hitherto state-owned companies. Most Mongolians did not understand the value of equity, however, and a small handful of the urban elite snapped up the coupons for a pittance.</p> <p>And many of the MSE's current members are a fossilized reminder of its early failures. Only 40 of the 350 companies listed on the exchange are actively trading; daily trading volume rarely exceeds $150,000. The exchange has delivered 17 IPOs in its history.</p> <p>\"The MSE basically lost its credibility a long time ago, which is why it needs to redefine itself,\" said Nagi Otgonshar, a vice president at Resource Investment Capital, a financial advisory firm in Ulan Bator.</p> <p>The exchange's's American-educated chief regulatory officer, Saruul Ganbaatar, said that the MSE has drafted a new securities law which will make it easier for Mongolian companies to list on the exchange \u2013 and for foreigners to invest in them.</p> <p>Ganbaatar accepts that Mongolian politicians and broking houses have been struggling to learn the ropes of modern capital markets. \"When I started last year there were 46 brokerages and now there are over 80,\" he said. \"This brings in a risk that some are not so competent, or not trained as well.\"</p> <p>Outside the room, optimism is certainly still high; some analysts say that the combined wealth from the country's 10 biggest mines, if evenly distributed, could make every Mongolian citizen a millionaire.</p> <p>Ulan Bator has begun to acquire the trappings of a boomtown. Across from the MSE is a gleaming 25-story office tower with Louis Vuitton and Armani outlets on the lower floors. Beyond, a sprawl of ramshackle Soviet apartment buildings and traditional felt-lined tents stretches into the distance.</p>",
  "<p>A plan to build an 11-mile long barrage across the Severn estuary has been given a boost after David Cameron asked ministers to re-examine the proposal.</p> <p>The \u00a330bn scheme, championed by the former Labour minister Peter Hain who quit his shadow cabinet role earlier this year to promote it, promises to generate 5% of the UK's electricity and create 10,000 jobs. It would be expected to be operational for more than 120 years.</p> <p>The prime minister met Hain last month to discuss the plan and, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c181a5c6-ea23-11e1-929b-00144feab49a.html#axzz244aOvwHW\" title=\"\">according to the FT</a>, has now asked Oliver Letwin, his policy chief, and Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, to investigate the idea for the 6.5GW barrage.</p> <p>Chris Huhne, Davey's predecessor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/18/severn-barrage-nuclear\" title=\"\">rejected a similar scheme two years ago because it would have cost the taxpayer too much</a>, but Hain says the new proposal would be entirely funded by private investors.</p> <p>\"We had a very good meeting. The prime minister promised to look into it,\" Hain <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-19311254\" title=\"\">told the BBC</a>. \"It's encouraging that Number 10 are taking the barrage much more seriously than has been the case over the last few years. Government support is an absolute pre-requisite for getting the whole project underway. Not a penny of taxpayers' money would be needed for this \u00a330bn investment, which would be transformative for Wales. It would create 20,000 jobs in construction and another 30,000 in activity around the barrage.\"</p> <p>In a letter to the prime minister seen by the Guardian, Hain wrote: \"Several sovereign wealth funds have already expressed interest in financing the \u00a330bn project, as long as government signals its support in principle, provides authorisation in the form of a Hybrid bill, and stabilises the electricity price for 25-30 years through a feed in tariff 'Contract for Difference', or similar mechanism. It is worth noting that after 25-30 years, when the price support drops away, the barrage will produce electricity virtually for free for at least another 90 years; this compares favourably with the lifespans of nuclear plants (35 years) and wind turbines (20-25 years).\"</p> <p>The BBC reported on Sunday that it is anticipated that much of the funding would come from investors in Kuwait and Qatar. The Guardian understands that any possible extra income from a road or rail link across the barrage from Lavernock Point near Cardiff across to Brean Down near Weston-super-Mare in Somerset would not be highlighted to investors at first. Corlan Hafren, the consortium of engineering and construction companies behind the proposal, wants to sell the plan on the strength of its electricity generating capacity alone.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/may/15/severn-barrage-peter-hain-energy\" title=\"\">Hain told the Guardian earlier this year</a> that in response to concerns by environmental groups, the new proposal would incorporate \"fish friendly\" turbines. The consortium says it has engaged with groups such as the RSPB to try and overcome fears about the barrage's possible impact on fauna in the estuary. However, the RSPB said this year that until the proposal are published in full, it was wrong for the consortium to suggest that the RSPB's environmental objections have been overcome.</p> <p>In his letter to Cameron, Hain wrote: \"The consortium has focused from the outset on mitigating the environmental impact. The revolutionary very-low-head turbines spin slowly and are fish friendly, and preserve an estimated 60% more intertidal habitat than previous schemes, thereby reducing the impact on birdlife. Without a barrage, rises in sea level would reduce intertidal habitat by roughly the same amount within 100 years.\" Hain also told the prime minister that the scheme would help to better protect homes in the area that are vulnerable to flooding of the River Severn.</p> <p>A Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) spokesperson said: \"The government is open to working with affordable, environmentally-responsible projects that represent good value for consumers. So far, we have only seen a very draft and high-level outline business case from the consortium. Even if this proposal can meet our criteria it has a long way to go in development.\"</p> <p>In a separate development, the former environment secretary Lord Deben confirmed to the Guardian on Monday that he stood down as chairman of Corlan Hafren two months ago. Deben, a former Conservative environment secretary, has been selected by Decc as the preferred candidate to succeed Lord Turner as chair of the committee on climate change.</p> <p>A Decc spokesman said: \"The appointment will be the subject of a parliamentary pre-appointment scrutiny hearing in September. Deben has provided both Decc and the Cabinet Office with a full list of his interests. If appointed, Deben will put in place arrangements to avoid a conflict of interest.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, WWF Cymru has urged caution on the new proposal. \"Establish the facts and show us the evidence. We're pleased that the government is looking at renewable energy projects as an alternative to new fossil or nuclear power stations, but in the case of the Severn barrage, we want to see a lot more research carried out.\"</p>",
  "<p>Children in a refugee camp in South Sudan are dying at more than twice the rate internationally recognised as an emergency, according to new figures released by M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF).</p> <p>On an average day in the Yusuf Batil camp, a hastily constructed expanse of tents among thick trees in a flood plain in Maban county in the north of South Sudan, three or four children under the age of five will die. In a \"normal\" emergency situation, the number would be one or two deaths daily for every 10,000 children.</p> <p>The overall mortality rate, which takes into account adults and older children, is also substantially above the emergency threshold, according to a survey conducted at the camp last month by MSF. About 58% of the camp's reported deaths have been children under five, while more than 25% have been people over 50.</p> <p>Yusuf Batil is one of four refugee camps in Maban county, home to more than 100,000 people fleeing fighting in Blue Nile State, just over the border in Sudan. It was set up to relieve pressure on Jamam camp, 52km away, <a href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=6106&amp;cat=press-release\" title=\"\">which flooded in June</a>. Mortality rates are now believed to be highest in Yusuf Batil, in part because the people living there often left it until the last moment to leave Sudan, when they were already weak.</p> <p>UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, reported last month that Yusuf Batil <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/500e7cc39.html\" title=\"\">was already close to reaching its capacity</a> of 34,500 people, adding that water supplies, hygiene and sanitation needed to be increased. During the rainy season, which is currently in full flow, the clay soil retains water, creating heavy black mud and pools of water. The stagnant water increases the risk of diseases.</p> <p>MSF said the major cause of death was \"overwhelmingly diarrhoea\", which caused more than 90% of deaths, although malnutrition was likely to have been a contributory factor in many of those deaths.</p> <p>\"These people had to undergo the most horrendous of journeys, and it got worse not better at every step,\" said Helen Ottens-Patterson, MSF's medical co-ordinator in South Sudan. After walking for so long with little food \u2013 many survived on leaves \u2013 the refugees were often malnourished when they arrived at the camp , increasing their vulnerability to disease.</p> <p>Many areas in the camps have been organised along the lines of the villages the refugees left behind: several are now marked by a neat row of dirt graves, covered by branches to protect them. \"The refugees are at the end of their reserves, particularly the under-fives and the elderly \u2013 that's where we see the highest mortality, in those two vulnerable groups,\" Ottens-Patterson said.</p> <p>Hassan Afeeda, a young man dressed in a Manchester United shirt, was one of those who fled the fighting, travelling through the night to conserve energy. \"When the fighting started, they bombed us, and then shelled us from a long way away,\" he said. \"We walked for a long time, carrying our young children. Even when we got near the border they were bombing us.\"</p> <p>Some people said they had lost relatives in air raids, others claimed they were tortured by Sudanese soldiers. Most of the refugees in Yusuf Batil are from the Ingessana, the same ethnic group as Malik Agar, the rebel leader fighting the Sudanese government in Blue Nile. The Sudanese armed forces deny targeting civilians, but they have been criticised by human rights groups and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVoc-SqQeEc\" title=\"\">the UN</a> for aerial bombardments.</p> <p>Nil's pregnant wife died in childbirth on the long trek from their home. He is looking after his eight children with some help from his mother-in-law, who is herself frail. All the children have eye infections, and several are malnourished, but Mohamed is the worst. When he stands up, holding on to the tent, his legs are curved like bows. Mohamed has lost so much weight his limbs and bottom seem to have no flesh under the skin, but his belly sticks out from his body, the clear sign of malnourishment.</p> <p>Mohamed and the others in the camp need far more help than they are getting. This is one of the most remote places in South Sudan, and the country is one of the least developed in the world. Before South Sudan's independence, <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/\" title=\"\">Sudan ranked 169 out of 187 countries</a> on the UN's human development index.</p> <p>The rainy season makes it impossible to bring food and other much-needed supplies in by road. \"It's like being on an island,\" says Frederic Cussigh, the local head of UNHCR. He says the crisis is so severe the agency has had to carry out tasks it doesn't usually do, such as improving a road between camps, and hiring customs officials to help charter planes to bring supplies in.</p> <p>The cost of operating in this kind of environment is extremely high. But MSF says the operation in Yusuf Batil needs to be scaled up quickly, or things will get worse. \"The next stage is just about as bad as it gets \u2013 everyone dying,\" says Ottens-Patterson. \"It's that close. We're at a crucial tipping point.\"</p>",

  "<p>There are flowers to fit every occasion. But if you are celebrating World Water Week (26-31 August), you might want to think twice. A single rose \u2013 grown in Kenya, as many of the world's cut flowers are \u2013 takes around 10 litres of water to produce, with the so-called water footprint, or virtual water export, of Kenya's floriculture industry having <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterfootprint.org%2FReports%2FReport45-WaterFootprint-Flowers-Kenya.pdf&amp;ei=PPwxUPfIMYi-0QWasYDgDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNES-5i4TSfDBOplXOn5NkBFZAb3cQ&amp;sig2=KJNuFzbOLKBy_OTz6DWMlQ\" title=\"\">more than doubled over the past 15 years</a>, mostly to supply the Netherlands (69%), the UK (18%) and Germany (7%).</p> <p>This notion of virtual water \u2013 the water embedded in the things that we trade \u2013 is gaining visibility as awareness of our global water crisis increases. I remember first getting to grips with the idea a few years ago when I interviewed Fred Pearce, author of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/scienceandnature/9781903919583/when-the-rivers-run-dry-what-happens-when-our-water-runs-out\" title=\"\">When the Rivers Run Dry</a>, for the <a href=\"http://www.greenleaf-publishing.com/productdetail.kmod?productid=2930\" title=\"\">University of Cambridge Top 50 Sustainability Books</a> project. According to his calculations, to get us through the day, it takes about a hundred times our own weight in water.</p> <p>Of course, water footprints are not the only impacts we find in our global supply chains. There are issues of labour rights, climate change, transparent governance, biodiversity loss and economic development, to mention but a few. The challenge is to manage and minimise the negative impacts. This is where I believe the example of Kenya's cut-flower industry can help us to tease out some hard-won lessons, starting with the story behind the Horticultural Ethical Business Initiative (HEBI).</p> <p>The seeds of the HEBI process were sown in November 1999 when local civil society organisations mounted a successful campaign against workers' rights violations in Cirio Delmonte, one of Kenya's largest pineapple growers. The success of this campaign raised concerns in the flower industry, prompting stakeholders to develop the Kenya Standard on Social Accountability and a Voluntary Private Initiative to oversee its implementation.</p> <p>However, the real impetus for HEBI came from the pressure exerted by transnational alliances of NGOs and consumer groups. The Kenya Women Workers Organisation (KEWWO) was funded by the UK-based Women Working Worldwide (WWW) to gather evidence of the Ethical Trade Initiative Base Code violations. Their report catalogued various unacceptable conditions, from pesticide poisoning to sexual harassment and rape, and spurred a campaign dubbed Produce Safely or Quit. At the same time, the Kenya Human Rights Commission issued a three month ultimatum to flower producers to improve working conditions, failing which they would go international in their campaign.</p> <p>When the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) was alerted to these serious labour rights violations in 2002, several of their corporate and NGO members visited Kenyan flower producers. In fear of losing their most significant market, Kenyan stakeholders came together for the first time to lay the groundwork for the formation of HEBI. What I find particular interesting is that the Horticultural Ethical Business Initiative (HEBI) did not arise from a vacuum of voluntary codes. On the contrary, there were already seven different international ethical codes being applied. However, they seemed to lack effectiveness and credibility.</p> <p>What made HEBI both necessary and different was the need to involve all stakeholders. As academic experts Catherine Dolan and Maggie Opondo put it: \"In contrast to the Fresh Produce Exporters Association of Kenya, the Kenya Flower Council and the Voluntary Private Initiative, which were locally initiated attempts to protect the image of the industry in overseas markets, HEBI was a product of direct Northern involvement. While ETI and WWW only performed a facilitative role in the process, they were nonetheless pivotal to <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dfid.gov.uk%2Fr4d%2FOutput%2F185360%2FDefault.aspx&amp;ei=LQAyUKSWJsbS0QXS9YHgDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHqEiqlEylxEZsu0TMn7jruaG9FfQ&amp;sig2=kibK-6RMBHRh1dwevWgzJQ\" title=\"\">the establishment of a locally owned multi-stakeholder process</a>.\"</p> <p>Today, according to ETI, there is still a lot of work to be done and plenty to criticise, but changes to the audit process and the purchasing practices of ETI members have led to a number improvements for workers in Kenya. For example, there are now more permanent contracts, establishment of worker welfare and gender committees, better provision of protective equipment, stricter pesticide controls and extensive improvements in housing. Furthermore, more women now have access to day-care facilities and there is general acceptance that pregnant women should have light duties.</p> <p>Most encouragingly, Kenya's convoluted and painful journey to creating their multi-stakeholder sector code has set a benchmark for other standards, like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), to learn from and emulate. It has also inspired complementary programmes like The Floriculture Sustainability Initiative, part of the Dutch Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH), which aims to accelerate and up-scale sustainable trade by building impact oriented coalitions of front running multinationals, civil society organisations, governments and other stakeholders.</p> <p>So, yes, flowers do have footprints. But perhaps, if we learn from Kenya's experiences, we can lighten the tread and ensure those footprints are heading in a more sustainable direction.</p> <p><em>Wayne Visser is director of Kaleidoscope Futures and senior associate at the </em><a href=\"http://www.cpsl.cam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership</em></a><em>.

  "<p>In 2008 and 2009 the UK suffered through one of the longest and deepest recessions of any major economy. Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed and more than a million people lost their jobs as a result. We analysed over five million companies over a period of eleven years to better understand the effects of the recession on UK towns and industry sectors.</p> <p>Our data scientists developed a proprietary algorithm for inferring industry classifications for UK companies, examining registered company closures and formations.</p> <p>As expected, there was a gradual growth in the number of businesses closing each year as the UK market expanded, until the recession hit. In late 2008, the number of companies that closed their doors rose markedly, bringing on seven consecutive months of negative growth in the size of the UK business population, which contracted by over 220,000 companies.</p> <p>These extreme levels of company dissolutions saw 2009 record the highest number of company closures ever, at over 492,000, compared with 312,000 in 2008, the second highest year.</p> <p>Northern England bore the brunt of the recession, with 10 of the 20 worst affected cities in the UK since 2008 located in the North West and Yorkshire regions, based on the percentage drop in numbers of active businesses. Leeds, Warrington, Bradford, Birmingham, Liverpool and Bristol all suffered heavy losses in the size of the business population.</p> <p>Of the 20 best performers, Jersey, Durham and Guernsey were the only locations with high growth (more than 5%) during the peak of the recession. The number of businesses registered in these localities has increased in every year of our study.</p> <p>Lincoln, Blackpool, Lerwick, Ilford and Middlesbrough were the best performing regions following the 08/09 recession, bouncing back strongly in 2011.</p> <p>The slowdown in 2008 put the squeeze on many business sectors with the Manufacturing &amp; Heavy Industry sector hit hardest, contracting in overall size by over 4% in 2009 after eight consecutive years of growth. Slightly above them at the foot of the table was Electronics &amp; Telecom, which shrunk by nearly 3%, and IT by 2%.</p> <p>Healthcare, Legal Services and Education &amp; Public Services have fared the best with sustained, if slower growth throughout. All industries recovered in 2010, aside from Human Resources which shrunk by 7.5%, suggesting both a latent exposure to the effects of the recession and that continuing high unemployment numbers are placing enormous pressure on the industry.</p> <p>Our analysis found a distinct correlation between the health of the entire UK market and that of the Construction &amp; Real Estate and Manufacturing &amp; Heavy Industry sectors, two of the three largest sectors in the UK and among the most sensitive to economic shocks.</p> <p>So far, Healthcare has witnessed more growth in the first decade of this century than any other sector, growing in size by nearly 250% since 2000, followed by Legal Services (213%) and Education &amp; Public Services (136%).</p> <p>The question is, will the UK enjoy the growth it experienced during the 90s and early 00s?</p> <p>All regions in the UK saw growth in the number of companies in 2011, with the business community growing by a total of over 180,000 last year. This was double the growth seen in 2010 and a far cry from 2009, when there was a net loss of over 127,000 businesses. The total number of active businesses in the UK in the last ten years has increased by 56.9% to over 2.94 million.</p> <p>However, the return to recession in 2012 and the recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/08/bank-england-zero-growth-gdp\">prediction of zero economic growth this year by the Bank of England</a> means businesses still face a turbulent time ahead, and one certainty is that the slump brought on by the global financial crisis will continue for some time to come.</p> <h2>How we generated this data</h2> <p>We analysed company dissolutions over a period of eleven years. To begin dissolution proceedings a company, or the registrar, will issue a striking-off application. </p> <p>Three months later a final dissolution notice will be issued at which point the company is struck off the register at Companies House. We took the dissolution date of the company to be that when the final dissolution notice was issued. </p> <p>Industry data is partially derived from self-reported Standard Industry Classification (SIC) figures and relies on coverage in that industry. As SIC codes are often ambiguous or incomplete, we used our own proprietary algorithm for inferring multi-industry classifications for UK companies, taking into account more dynamic data sources such as company websites, and allowing us to generate multi-industry classifications for over two million UK companies. Industry size is relative to number of companies in that industry.</p> <p>Companies House introduced a tighter compliance regime in 2009, which may have accounted for some of the rise in company closures that year. The spike in dissolutions in May 2009 can be partly attributed to a mass striking off of limited companies registered by an employment contractor. Figures published are rounded.</p> <p><em>Launched in April 2011, <a href=\"https://www.duedil.com/\">Duedil</a> is the largest source of free private company information in the UK and Ireland.

  "<p>It's widely known that towns and cities in the United Kingdom are - in theory at least - protected from urban sprawl by the existence of statutory green belt land. &#xa0;However, precisely where all this land lies is not widely known. In England, as of 2011, about 13% of land across 186 local authorities was designated as green belt but anyone trying to pinpoint exactly where it all is soon runs into difficulties, as this freedom of information request clearly <a href=\"http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/foi_request_greenbelt_boundaries?unfold=1\">shows</a>. </p> <p>Current changes to the <a href=\"www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/2116950.pdf\">planning system</a>(PDF), and calls to release more land to house <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/uk/datablog/2012/jul/16/2011-census-results-data\">a growing population</a>, make this green belt data deficit all the more frustrating, particularly given the government claim that it 'attaches great importance to green belts' (National Planning Policy Framework, Chapter 9, p.19). <a href=\"www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/lagreenbelt2010\">General data</a> on green belt land in England are available from the Department for Communities and Local Government, yet no freely accessible national online map of the green belt is currently available.</p> <p>Answering even the simplest of questions about the geography of the green belt is therefore substantially more difficult than it ought to be. Is there any green belt land within the M25? Does Leicester have a green belt? Does Hull? How big is the North West green belt? Is there any green belt in Walthamstow? &#xa0;My quest to find out the answers to such seemingly simple questions and produce a shareable online map of the English green belt has been successful, yet I can't share it because green belt map data remains closed, despite the advent of an <a href=\"http://data.gov.uk/\">open data culture</a> in central government. The story is similar in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/sep/16/edinburgh-greenspace-map-ordnance-survey\">other parts of the UK</a> but here I focus on England and my quest to create an open, shareable national green belt map.</p> <p>Why does any of this matter? It matters for many reasons, but here are two. Firstly, there is almost constant pressure to open up green belt land for development yet interested parties (be they housebuilders or local residents) cannot freely and easily find out what's green belt and what's not. This makes it much more difficult to have a meaningful debate about topics of real national interest, like <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/hs2-maps-20120110/\">HS2</a> or house building in the green belt. Secondly, in this new age of openness and transparency in government it seems odd that members of the public, researchers and organisations should have to pay to access information that is, after all, a collection of government-funded data. As ever with such matters, it is all a little bit more complicated than it seems but I take the view that this data forms a core component of our national digital infrastructure and should be free.</p> <p>The back story to all this is <a href=\"http://mapgubbins.tumblr.com/post/15993324558/green-belt-boundaries-for-england-open-or-closed\">somewhat drawn-out</a>, but it can be summarised as follows. I discovered that there existed a digital boundary of the English green belt via a <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/corporate/pdf/909375.pdf\">Land Use Change Statistics bulletin</a>(PDF) from 2008 but I soon learned that the dataset was not publicly available. I then found that the data could be obtained from Landmark, a well known digital mapping organisation, so I set about getting a quote. I was told that it would cost in the region of \u00a335,000 plus VAT for the complete English dataset. This set alarm bells ringing, but in fairness to Landmark I should say that they were simply the private sector organisation chosen by the government to capture and maintain green belt boundary data. I then went back to the Department for Communities and Local Government to ask if I could have the data for research purposes, since I am currently undertaking a project on housing market search patterns in green belt areas. I was granted a licence and given the data but I can't share it with anyone. Digital data expert Owen Boswarva provides <a href=\"http://mapgubbins.tumblr.com/post/15993324558/green-belt-boundaries-for-england-open-or-closed\">more detail on his blog</a>, but the bottom line is that, for now, this crucial part of our digital data infrastructure remains closed.</p> <p>In answer to the simple questions posed above, I can tell you that there is green belt land within the M25, that Leicester and Hull have no green belt, that the North West green belt is very large indeed (more than 1,000 square miles) and that the <a href=\"http://www.walthamstow-today.co.uk/news.cfm?id=13522\">green belt in Walthamstow</a> is small but significant. For those with a keen interest in the green belt, these are hardly revelations, but a national online map of green belt land would allow users to examine in detail the geography of England's green belt and build up a very fine-grained picture of this historically contested national resource. It would also allow us to explore, for example, York's donut-shaped green belt, Blackpool's patchwork green belt or analyse the overlaps between the proposed route for HS2 and existing green belt land. Much more importantly, a national green belt map would allow all parties - pro and anti-development - equal access to data on a topic where location really is everything.</p> <p>Let us know what you think to this quest in the comments below. </p> <h2>More data</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p> <h2>World government data</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world-government-data\">Search the world's government data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Development and aid data</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's global development data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a><br>\u2022 Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@theguardian.com\">data@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">Follow us on Twitter</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">Like us on Facebook</a></strong></p>",
  "<p>It's interesting that, while everyone is getting ironically excited about The Expendables 2 (the irony is dead important), the announcement of a new Army of Two title has been met with much head-shaking and world-weary bemusement. EA's co-op shooter titles are cut from the same idiotic, hyper-masculine cloth as the Expendables flicks, but yet the games industry has seemingly run out of patience with guilty pleasures. I'm not sure if that's progress or not. </p> <p>Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel at first seems like a toned down version of the previous two titles. The daft, sweary mercenaries have been replaced by two anonymous troopers, Alpha and Bravo, on some covert mission against Mexican drug gangs. This is a darker world, with more at stake, yet the gameplay seems highly familiar \u2013 blast through a series of set-piece battles, using co-operative tactics as much as possible while occasionally splitting up to take on solo paths.</p> <p>At Gamescom on Wednesday, I played a mission named Drug Lab, set in a decrepit building filled with lower ranking members of a violent cartel. While the previous games used the Unreal Engine, this one is built with EA DICE's superior Frostbite 2 technology so each environment is absolutely loaded with destructible items. With enough gun fire, stone pillars can be obliterated into skeletal poles of shrapnel and wire, while furniture is splintered into millions of wood chips. </p> <p>The cover system works well. Approaching a wall or scenic object and hitting a button locks you to it, allowing you to aim and shoot from safety or just spray gun fire without looking. Players can disengage from this at any time by just pulling back on the analogue controller; or you can use the gun sight to target another cover position, then hit the button to whiz to it \u2013 allowing you to zip about from one safe place to the next. It's not revolutionary, but in a cover-based shooter this stuff is important to get right.</p> <p>From here, it's all about legging it through the building, up the stairs and through derelict rooms, shooting the bad guys. Players score better for using co-op tactics like flanking. Points boost a meter in the top centre of the screen and when this fills you get access to the Overkill mode. When one player hits this, both get a timed sequence of ultra damage, but if both instigate overkill together, they go into a bullet time sequence for added destructive effect. Again, not a single original idea in sight, but the systems combine well \u2013 and to visually impressive effect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394961748\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/20/1345466807050/Army-Two-Devils-Cartel-006.jpg\" alt=\"Army Two Devil's Cartel\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The action leads out onto a rooftop, where a helicopter evac has been arranged. While one player gets into the chopper and mans the mini-gun, the other must work along the rooftops, searching out an enemy with an RPG. It's exactly like one of the co-op missions in Modern Warfare 3. You see, a theme is sort of developing here: Army of Two remains silly, structurally derivative fun and despite a multitude of familiar moments, working out the most efficient ways to combine resources is still quite a kick if you completely disengage your brain and moral compass. </p> <p>\"We wanted to take the flanking and the weapons customisation from the first titles, add in the Frostbite engine and all the destruction, and give it all some really vsiceral production values,\" says producer Zach Mumbach. \"There are lots of big moments, and it's not about watching them, it's about playing them.</p> <p>\"And whatever positive effects you have in the world, you're rewarded for that \u2013 not only in terms of Overkill points but with money. And that feeds back into weapon customisation. You can bring out custom guns for different situations, combining shotguns, sniper rifles and all sorts.\"</p> <p>The Devil's Cartel allows drop-in drop-out online co-op as well as split-screen two player, and there will be other multiplayer modes, though those haven't been announced yet. There's no word on whether developer, Visceral Games, will be resurrecting the Aggro meter from Army of Two: 40th Day, which caused enemies to target the player with the most Aggro points, allowing the other to sneak around and flank them. It would provide some extra tactical clout to a title for which Overkill is both a game system and an accurate description.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel is out on PS3 and Xbox in March 2013</em></p>",

Back then, as a pre-teen nerd more into libraries than concerts, my musical scope basically started and ended with mainstream pop, courtesy of the then nascent MTV, whose birth I witnessed. Mind you, pop in the 80s was in its zenith, with such diverse acts as the Thompson Twins, Spandau Ballet and Michael Jackson providing endless variety.</p> <p>Then we had a visit at home, some remote relative who was a bit older than me and mostly ignored me in favour of his Walkman. One day he asked me what I listened to. I proudly displayed my Kenny Loggins tape, along with Culture Club, Genesis, Madonna \u2026 he promptly told me I needed saving and he passed me his headphones. It was Pour Some Sugar on Me. It blew me away.</p> <p>For the next few days I listened to that tape non-stop, delighting in the endless intricacies and layer upon layer of sound. So amazing! Over the next few weeks, he gradually introduced me to his other favs, AC/DC, Van Halen, and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. I never looked back. My first actual purchase was the 1984 Vinyl LP (I still have it!), followed days latter by the Hysteria cassette tape. So many years later, I still love Hysteria. It, was one of the anchors sounds of my teen years. Yes, it sounds a bit dated now, too rich and overly decorated for today's minimalist tastes, but its still beautiful and it was my door to rock.</p> <p>\u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/12fa3845-7c62-36e5-a8da-8be137155a72\" title=\"\">JuanGM</a></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/b933630f-d436-43f5-adad-b11043de24b2\" title=\"\">A Troubled Piece of Fruit \u2013 Stephan Nance</a></h2> <p>This young singer\u2013songwriter specialises in awkwardly charming, vegan, straight edge, queer, alternative, piano folk-rock. His description, not mine, but don't let that put you off.</p> <p>His voice is not the voice of a generation or the majority, but his upbeat, quirky piano pop deals in fun, the environment and optimism. The music changes from the gentle, soothing Spring to the quirky Firecracker, a song of erratic love, before moving on to the emotional turmoil of Fall. Then there's Resurrection, an anthem to Oregon's climate, and Made in Vermont, which sounds smooth and silky but, alas, is the shortest track.</p> <p>This debut album should not be ignored. I have never done a review before, but this one made me, 'cause I just love it.</p> <p>\u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/b933630f-d436-43f5-adad-b11043de24b2\" title=\"\">Rexyboy</a></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/12fa3845-7c62-36e5-a8da-8be137155a72\" title=\"\">Strange Tourist \u2013 Gareth Liddiard </a></h2> <p>Gareth Liddiard is singer, guitarist and songwriter for Australian band the Drones, a band on a line of direct descent from Nick Cave, usually landing somewhere between the uninhibited raucous rock of the Birthday Party and his more mainstream work with the Bad Seeds. Throw in deeper and more personal lyrics than Nick ever attempted, a dash of bush balladeering and a healthy dose of pub thrash punk complete with wailing guitars, and you may be starting to get close to imagining the soundscape they create.</p> <p>On Strange Tourist Liddiard slows things down and strips them back to their simplest level; an acoustic guitar and ta unique, love it or hate it, vocal style. His voice is the emotional heart of these performances, it twists and slides its melodies around the guitar lines dragging the listener in to the various stories and scenarios the lyrics describe. These are not simple, immediately accessible songs, but require repeated, in depth listening. Liddiard's lyrical artistry pulls our human emotional entanglements apart to reveal the selves within. If you can imagine a Lucian Freud portrait as a song you are beginning to understand the scope of his artistic ambition.</p> <p>There is no bombast here, no posturing on the highest available moral ground, no anthemic declarations of politically correct views.

  "<p>It transformed the airline business with its no-frills approach to flying and now Ryanair is considering the same approach with airports after the budget carrier confirmed its interest in acquiring London Stansted.</p> <p>The Dublin-based airline has held discussions over taking a 25% stake in the Essex airport, which has a price tag of more than \u00a31bn. The current owner, BAA, announced on Monday that it is ending a protracted legal battle to prevent the sale of Stansted, which had been ordered by the Competition Commission in 2009 but had been hotly contested by BAA.</p> <p>A spokesman for Ryanair, which operates 41 planes from the airport, said the carrier would be interested in a deal following the BAA announcement.</p> <p>Last month Howard Millar, Ryanair's deputy chief executive, said the airline has been approached by potential buyers with the view to joining a consortium bid. He said: \"We have met these consortia and they want us to be an anchor tenant.\"</p> <p>Ryanair has long campaigned to have airports remade in its low-cost image, and has cited Stansted as an example of the \"Taj Mahal\" facilities that are out-of-kilter with the low-cost model that now dominates the European short-haul market.</p> <p>A Ryanair-owned airport would emphasise low cost and quick turnarounds, so the airline will speed up the journey from check-in to security and the departure gate if it can. \"We want as small and efficient a facility as possible,\" said a Ryanair spokesman.</p> <p>At Stansted, however, that would probably have to apply to a new terminal. The current terminal, designed by renowned British architect Lord Foster, embodies the \"glass palaces\" that are hated by Ryanair's outspoken boss, Michael O'Leary, because the cost of building them is recouped in higher landing fees that in turn result in steep fare increases. Passengers would also be expected to walk on and off airplanes via steps, instead of the airport bridges that are common at Heathrow.</p> <p>\"The future for short-haul airlines in Europe is walk-on and walk-off services,\" said the spokesman.</p> <p>However, shops and restaurants would still be available in departure terminals, disproving conspiracy theories that Ryanair would limit refreshments at airports in order to boost onboard food and drink sales. \"There would need to be restaurants and bars, we accept that,\" said the spokesman.</p> <p>Last year, Stansted posted an operating profit of \u00a339.4m, compared with \u00a3526.8m at Heathrow, but Ryanair believes that would be even bigger if the owner lowered its landing charges to encourage more traffic \u2013 which in turn could trigger the return of Ryanair routes that have been pulled by the carrier in recent years in a protest over fees.</p> <p>A spokesman for Ryanair said on Monday that if the airline did not take a stake it would also be interested in giving long-term assurances to bidders over its commitment to the airport.</p> <p>Ryanair and its biggest Stansted rival, easyJet, have been pulling capacity out of the airport over the past five years, reflecting their displeasure over rising landing fees.</p> <p>The Ryanair spokesman said the airline would be interested in returning the airport to pre-boom levels of use, when it handled 24 million passengers a year compared with 18 million now.</p> <p>\"There is huge growth potential there and we would be very interested in discussing the future of Stansted with any groups looking at a potential purpose.\"</p> <p>Stansted is now Britain's fourth largest airport, having slipped behind Manchester, which carried 18.8 million passengers last year \u2013 760,000 more than Stansted. The Essex airport will be BAA's third major disposal following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/21/baa-sells-gatwick\" title=\"\">sale of Gatwick in 2009 </a>and the disposal of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/23/baa-sells-edinburgh-airport-gip\" title=\"\">Edinburgh airport in 2012</a>. Both times the airports were acquired by Global Infrastructure Partners, a New York-based investment group, but it is believed that GIP is not interested in bidding this time. As the owner of London's City airport, it is also likely that any offer would face watchdog scrutiny.</p> <p>As well as Ryanair, other potential bidders include Manchester Airports Group, which has expressed a strong interest in Stansted.</p> <p>It is not unknown for airlines to invest in airports. Germany's Lufthansa owns 10% of Frankfurt airport and has a joint venture in a terminal at Munich airport. Ryanair also advised on the design of a terminal at Charleroi airport in Belgium.</p> <p>However, some experts have warned that Ryanair's interest could lead to other carriers quitting the airport.</p> <p>Chris Tarry, an airline industry consultant, said other airlines might be deterred from using Stansted if Ryanair became a co-owner of the airport. \"Ryanair is in a dominant position at Stansted and short-haul airlines already have concerns about going there because they already have a very forceful competitor there. So what will they think if that competitor also becomes a shareholder in Stansted?\"</p> <p>BAA said it would not challenge a recent loss in the court of appeal over the commission ruling and will sell the airport. Stansted is valued at just over \u00a31.3bn according to a formula used by the Civil Aviation Authority, the industry regulator, to calculate landing charges at the airport. However, some industry observers view \u00a31bn as a par bid for the asset.</p> <p>\"Having carefully considered the court of appeal's recent ruling, BAA has decided not to appeal to the supreme court and is now proceeding with the sale of Stansted airport,\" said BAA. Last week BAA's biggest shareholder, Spanish conglomerate Ferrovial, announced an agreement to sell 10% of BAA to Qatar's sovereign wealth fund in a transaction that would give <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/17/qatar-buy-20-baa-share-heathrow\" title=\"\">Qatar Holding a 20% stake in BAA's parent company</a>.</p>",

  "<p>A common complaint from my librarian friends: too often users fail to appreciate that the resources they use online are only available to them because the library has purchased them. This is aggravated by confusion about what an academic library is. Researchers actively using library resources online may not think of themselves as using the library because they have not recently visited the building.</p> <p>Libraries need to overcome such confusion to ensure that the contributions they make to the university are fully appreciated. Demonstrating value is key if libraries are to be able to continue to claim their share of institutional funding.</p> <p>As part of a wider focus on working with the library community, SAGE recently commissioned a research project from LISU, <a href=\"http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/ls/lisu/\" title=\"\">the Library Information Science unit</a> at Loughborough University. Although not the first research piece on this issue, LISU's research offers an up to date, accessible insight into best practices for libraries in demonstrating value, not just in terms of use, but also in terms of impact on research and teaching outcomes.</p> <p>Drawing on research from the UK, the US and Scandinavia, the LISU study shows a world in which libraries are actively engaged in gathering evidence to demonstrate their value \u2013 but challenges remain. Though a good deal of evidence is collected, much of it is evidence of activity rather than evidence of value and impact. The kind of evidence provided by the <a href=\"www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/research/ciber/charleston-survey.pdf\" title=\"\">2009 CIBER global library study</a>, demonstrating that per capita expenditure and use of e-journals is strongly correlated to research performance, is more challenging for individual institutions to develop.</p> <p>Evidence is critical not only because administrators are increasingly required to justify expenditure, but also because librarians cannot take faculty support for granted. Though librarians do get a lot of positive feedback from faculty, the LISU study shows many librarians believe that researchers do not really know how to use all the library's resources. There is also a strong sense that teaching staff are often surprised by the sorts of support on offer.</p> <p>Library buildings are increasingly geared towards meeting the needs of students, with caf\u00e9s and social space provided alongside information resources. At the University of Utah, <a href=\"http://campusguides.lib.utah.edu/content.php?pid=103367&amp;sid=777097\" title=\"\">a recent survey</a> showed that many teaching and research staff regarded the library as a large undergraduate study hall. With material available online and document delivery being made directly to offices, many faculty never visited the library building.</p> <p>This creates an increased risk that faculty support for libraries will erode if faculty no longer perceive themselves as actively supported by the library. Disconnects of this kind are widely perceived. One librarian said: \" ... most faculty really do ignore us or take [the library] for granted, while most librarians think that we are a central part of the faculty's mission\".</p> <p>The LISU study highlights a number of areas where libraries are actively engaging with faculty and students, providing evidence of value more effectively. The biggest trend is in collaborative working between librarians and faculty to support research and teaching roles. Library teaching embedded in departmental courses has become an important role for libraries, contributing to enhancing students' skills in information literacy and other areas.</p> <p>Some universities, particularly in the US, have moved further in developing co-teaching courses. At others, there is librarian involvement in curriculum design with a view to ensuring that information skills are embedded in the course from the start. This kind of close working between faculty and librarians can also apply in research partnerships. An example cited is the involvement of subject librarians at the <a href=\"http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">University of Nottingham</a> in systematic reviews: their time is costed and documented as part of the research project in recognition that library skills are key to the successful delivery of the project, and librarians contributing to systematic reviews are cited as co-authors on the publications.</p> <p>While there are gains to be made, library contributions to teaching and research can also pose significant challenges - notably that of time management. Providing embedded information training is a time-consuming support service for the library. Librarians are also aware of the limitations on faculty time in any partnerships.</p> <p>For librarians to understand the perceptions of faculty and students and know how to reach and influence them, requires effective marketing - but this isn't just a question of promotion. The research found that in delivering shared services, <a href=\"http://www.purdue.edu/\" title=\"\">Purdue University</a> emphasises the importance of framing services from a faculty rather than from a librarian perspective. Librarians engaged in research support need to \"present themselves as someone who can solve a problem research staff are having directly\". A similar concern came across in the issue of using appropriate language \u2013 at the <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">University of Sussex</a>, sessions on electronic resources are presented as 'awareness raising' rather than 'training' to avoid generating unnecessary resistance.</p> <p>Asked about the biggest impediment to promoting library services, one librarian summarised the issue as: \"lack of time: for library staff to have time to promote resources to individuals; for academic staff to read and digest emails or other communications\". This challenge was expressed in all three regions surveyed. Given the reality of time challenges on both sides, libraries need to be smart in identifying ways of building relationships and communicating value which are effective and scaleable.</p> <p>There are also recommendations for senior university managers \u2013 the full report can be <a href=\"http://libraryvalue.wordpress.com/report/\" title=\"\">downloaded here</a>. We undertook this project as a chance to better understand how libraries can support teaching and research staff.

  "<p>From the moment Her Majesty said hello to Mr Bond at Danny Boyle's epic opening ceremony, the nation was swept away by the Olympic Games. The goal of London 2012 was to 'inspire a generation', now the hard work will start, in making that goal a reality.</p> <p>As a business operating across 20 countries <a href=\"http://www.havas-se.com/\" title=\"\">Havas Sports &amp; Entertainment</a> (HS&amp;E) is fortunate to work with a wide-range of sports federations and sponsors from around the world. For this reason we staged a series of daily seminars, during the Games, involving some of sport's most powerful influencers to get their views on the Games and ask: what next?</p> <p>From <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/about-us/the-people-delivering-the-games/locog/\" title=\"\">LOCOG</a> deputy chairman Sir Keith Mills, to <a href=\"http://www.paralympic.org/\" title=\"\">International Paralympic Committee</a> president Sir Philip Craven, the message is clear: these have been a fantastic Games, but they should not be seen as the end of a journey; rather the first step towards a future where sport plays an integral role in positively changing society.</p> <p>At HS&amp;E our primary function around the Olympics is working with sponsors. Without them the Games would not be on the scale and level of sophistication they are today \u2013 sponsors such as Coca Cola, Lloyds, EDF and Atos provide specialist business services, investment and global marketing support that truly enhance the experience for athletes, spectators and fans watching at home.</p> <p>But one major issue now facing brands that are not long-term IOC partners is what role they will play once the Games have left town.</p> <p>If a brand uses its sponsorship in the right way, delivers on its promises and enhances the experience of the Games for fans and its target audiences, then Olympic sponsorship can have significant business benefits.</p> <p>We are running a long-term study into the effectiveness of Olympic sponsorship and have found perceptions of brand image are on average 25-50% more positive amongst sponsors. It's a cluttered and competitive market so the key for brands is to tell a clear story unique to the association between their brand or product and the Games, and develop content, activity and experiences that are meaningful, make a positive contribution towards the sport, are interactive and add value to the fan experience.</p> <p>At our seminars we heard a few examples of this. Firstly from Thierry Borra, director of Olympic Games management at Coca-Cola about the <a href=\"http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/olympic-games/move-to-the-beat-london-2012-mark-ronson.html\" title=\"\">Move to the Beat campaign</a> which has been built around a Mark Ronson produced single featuring the sounds of sport and integrated across all relevant Coke marketing activity and through every channel. A celebration of both athletic endeavour and fan culture.</p> <p>Nathan Homer, global Olympic project director for P&amp;G, discussed the <a href=\"https://www.pgproudsponsorofmums.co.uk/thank_you_mum\" title=\"\">Thank You Mum</a> campaign and taught us how important it is to find a clear position for your campaign and deliver a simple and emotional message.</p> <p>While Sally Hancock, director of Olympic marketing and group sponsorship at Lloyds, talked about the <a href=\"http://www.lloydstsblondon2012.co.uk/en/In-your-community/Local-Heroes/\" title=\"\">Lloyds Local Heroes</a> athlete support programme and emphasised the need to make your campaign relevant to local communities.</p> <p>Each of our speakers raised the question of legacy and this is now a major debate involving the main political parties, organisations, sports bodies and major sporting figures.</p> <p>All of the sponsors we spoke with emphasised the natural legacy their involvement with London 2012 will leave, whether it's Lloyds educating small business suppliers on how to tender for future development projects or EDF putting the infrastructure in place at the Olympic Park for sustainable energy supplies. The choice now for London 2012 partners is whether they continue to contribute to sport and if so, how?</p> <p>A number of our guests were quick to highlight the opportunities available for official partners and other businesses to contribute to the Olympic legacy in a meaningful way.</p> <p>Sir Keith Mills shared the fantastic work of the <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/join-in/education/international-inspiration/\" title=\"\">London 2012 International Inspiration programme</a>, which has helped 12 million children in 20 countries worldwide and would benefit from commercial investment.</p> <p>Sir Philip Craven of the International Paralympic Committee reminded us London is about to stage the biggest Paralympic Games in history and highlighted the positive role sponsorship could play in developing sport for people with disabilities.</p> <p>Sue Tiballs from the Women's Sport &amp; Fitness Foundation (<a href=\"http://wsff.org.uk/\" title=\"\">WSFF</a>) told us women's sport may never have a better chance to establish a prominent place in the nation's psyche. While former NBA player John Amaechi, who is now a member of the LOCOG Diversity Board, warned that London must deliver on its promise to use the Games to promote further diversity and integration.</p> <p>Iain Edmonson, head of major events at <a href=\"http://www.londonandpartners.com/\" title=\"\">London &amp; Partners</a> highlighted the tremendous opportunities there are for overseas investors every week of the year in London. While Scott McLeod, director of commercial marketing at the London Legacy Development Corporation talked about how brands can play a role in the physical legacy left in East London by the Olympic Park.</p> <p>Clearly there is great potential for brands to contribute to a London 2012 legacy. First they need to judge the mood of the nation \u2013 the benefits of showing you are committed to a longer-term journey than London 2012 are plentiful \u2013 I would also argue that the dangers of abandoning sport at a time when it could take great strides forward are acute. Brands could look like they were profiteering from the Olympics if they just walk away.</p> <p>My feeling is that schools and grassroots sport will be an important area for brands to consider along with the smaller federations that could benefit most from the London 2012 platform. Campaigns which blend meaningful grassroots support in the form of business services, cash and marketing combined with an association with some of the high-profile stars of London 2012 could be particularly powerful.</p> <p>With this in mind I hope to regularly hear of the term 'public-private partnership' as brands contribute to improved sports facilities and programmes across the country.</p> <p>London 2012 genuinely has given the UK a once in a lifetime chance to inspire a generation. I'll leave you with some words from Sir Keith Mills who told us: \"If you get the right group of people and a clear vision, you can achieve extraordinary things\". Let's hope the legacy of London 2012 is approached with the same gusto as the bid and delivery. If it is the benefits of the Olympic Games will be felt for decades.</p> <p><em>Lucien Boyer is the president and CEO of </em><a href=\"http://www.havas-se.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Havas Sports &amp; Entertainment</em></a><em> \u2013 follow the organisation on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Havas_SE\" title=\"\"><em>@Havas_SE</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Their Olympic glory may now be over, but the stars of London 2012 are enjoying a new spotlight \u2013 as fashion's latest darlings. Images of Michael Phelps in the latest advertising campaign for Louis Vuitton's Core Values range were released on Thursday (16 August) and show Phelps sporting a three-piece suit and sharing a cup of tea with the previous greatest Olympian of all time, Ukranian gymnast Larisa Latynina. It's a long way from swimming caps, goggles and Speedos.</p> <p>Fashion and sport alliances look likely to continue in this vein in the aftermath of London 2012. Retiree Gold medallist cyclist Victoria Pendleton recently confessed a dream to model for Burberry. \"I've been invited a couple of times [to shows] by Burberry,\" she told Vogue.com. \"I haven't been able to go because of my training schedule and I literally cried when I found out that it wasn't possible.\"</p> <p>Such passion for fashion ran throughout the Olympic village. Heptathlete Jessica Ennis talked of a post-gold shopping trip to Selfridges, and is a fan of designers including Alexander McQueen and Victoria Beckham, while swimming ace Ryan Lochte will have a cameo in the new series of fashion plate TV show, 90210 and is friends with catwalk model Karlie Kloss. Over in gymnastics, Team GB's Louis Smith and American Gabby Douglas have both expressed an interest in working in fashion, with Douglas standing out for her fashion-friendly outfit \u2013 high wedges, hot pink miniskirt and digital print vest \u2013 when the US female gymnastics team appeared on Letterman. Smith, with his striking facial hair and quiff, currently stars in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2OXqkd8d7M\" title=\"\">Adidas Take the Stage</a> campaign, and Douglas has signed an endorsement deal with Proctor &amp; Gamble, the parent company that own Covergirl cosmetics and Olay.</p> <p>The commercial potential for a fashion brand working with these new Olympic stars is being revealed. \"If a brand signed up its ambassadors early and are busy releasing campaign images now they will reap the rewards,\" says Carrie Tyler, editor of Elleuk.com. \"Even those with no previous interest in sport are captivated by these Olympians.\" Indeed. Puma hoped that using Usain Bolt as their campaign star would increase their sports sales by 5%. Bradley Wiggins' range of cycling-tinged polo shirts with Fred Perry \u2013 released two weeks into the Tour de France \u2013 had sold out by the time London 2012 finished. David Beckham, a trailblazer when it comes to sportsmen working with fashion brands, launched his second range of bodywear with H&amp;M this week, dubbing the first \"incredibly successful\" on his Facebook page. \"Sports personalities reach such a wide audience that no other celebrity can,\" says Rosie Holden, director of John Doe, a marketing agency that work with Adidas. \"The appeal goes beyond the usual demographic categories.\"</p> <p>While most models won't be recognised by most consumers, these famous faces provide immediate association. Unlike a celebrity, though, Olympians are heroes, held in awe for their exceptional abilities. \"An Olympics medal winner has reached the highest possible point of personal and sporting achievement,\" says Ruth Mortimer, editor of Marketing Week. \"By linking themselves to these people, brands are trying to create a shortcut to their own reputations in consumer minds.\"</p> <p>The right personality for the right brand is key to this working. \"Any fashion brand needs to look closely at what the athlete represents in terms of potential shared brand values and attributes,\" says Holden. She believes Pendleton \"could certainly fit a brand with English heritage, like Burberry\" and cites Wiggins and Fred Perry as a good existing example. \"As a global ambassador, we couldn't think of anyone better,\" agrees Richard Martin, Fred Perry's Director of Marketing. \"In some respects, he transcends the sport.\" Crossover appeal like this, also present in the likes of Beckham and Bolt, is what brands ultimately hope for. Louis Vuitton will be hoping Phelps keeps his golden touch now that he's out of the pool.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hi Robin, can you tell us a little bit more about </strong><a href=\"http://wearesocial.net/\" title=\"\"><strong>We Are Social</strong></a><strong> and your role there as global MD?</strong></p> <p>We Are Social is a conversation agency \u2013 we help brands to listen, understand and engage in conversations in social media. We created We Are Social in response to the impact of social media on the media consumption landscape, and the need for a new kind of agency to help brands succeed in this environment. We moved from the 'big idea' to the 'social idea'.</p> <p>In four years, the company has grown from myself and my co-founder Nathan McDonald and a single launch client to a multinational business with eight offices worldwide and 220 staff. We've achieved this growth purely though client revenues and without external funding.</p> <p>I run the company as global MD in partnership with Nathan. We split things fairly equally between us, with both of us spending time on different clients and management issues, although Nathan is more focussed on the financial side while I'm driving more of our marketing and PR efforts. Our roles have evolved hugely since starting the business \u2013 after all, when you go from two employees to 220, the challenges we deal with now are hugely different to those when we started out.</p> <p><strong>What did you do before We Are Social?</strong></p> <p>I've been lucky enough to have been in 'digital' ever since I graduated from the University of Bristol in 1996, and it has been quite a rollercoaster ride, to say the least. I started with building websites for the likes of Microsoft and the Royal Mail in a shed in Cirencester, and that was followed by a stint in New York trying to rescue the ailing boo.com \u2013 I then landed a job as 'entrepreneur in residence' at an 'incubator' that provided funding, office space and consultancy to internet start-ups just before the dot.com crash.</p> <p>After that was the downhill ride of two redundancies and around a year of not being able to find a job before going back into the digital agency world. I then rebuilt my career over six years in progressively more senior agency roles before taking the leap to launch We Are Social with Nathan in 2008. Looking back over the last four years, yes, we had big plans and we worked extremely hard to achieve them, but things have gone better than we could have ever reasonably hoped for. To some extent, we have been very lucky, but they're right when they say you make your own luck.</p> <p><strong>What does an average day look like for you? </strong></p> <p>There's no such thing! I could be flying out to Singapore to help with recruitment or over to New York for a pitch. Often I'll be working with senior management in London on growth and key hires. Today I happen to be in Munich to help the team here celebrate their new office space. Every day is different.</p> <p><strong>What are the biggest challenges to your job and how do you overcome them?</strong></p> <p>For me personally, the biggest issue is managing my own time \u2013 there's never enough of it, and it's impossible to fit everything in. When it comes to the business, which has grown rapidly in four years, the challenge is finding and hiring the best people at all levels.</p> <p>We've also tried really hard to build and maintain the right company culture while growing quickly. When we started We Are Social, we wanted to make it the kind of place we would have wanted to work when we were younger, and I think our extremely high staff retention rate is an indicator that we've succeeded in this. Of course, part of our culture is to always strive for excellence in our client work and because of this we've managed to pick up and retain some of the world's biggest brands as clients on our four year journey.</p> <p><strong>What first made you want to work in social media and digital marketing?</strong></p> <p>Digital and social media was a new frontier \u2013 it wasn't an established playing field and held unlimited possibilities. For the past 16 years of my career, every day has been different; we're constantly learning and trying new things, and making a genuine difference to society and commerce.</p> <p><strong>What's do you think is the key to being a good managing director, especially on a global scale?</strong></p> <p>Probably learning when to let go and trust others, and hiring good people you can trust. Also the team need to feel as though the agency has leadership and vision, instead of feeling like they're just being managed. They also need to feel confident that we'll achieve that vision \u2013 both things I believe to be really important differentiators.</p> <p><strong>What would you say your management style is?</strong></p> <p>I'm not sure I have a style \u2013 I've been learning as I go along! I think my main priorities are making sure that everyone has respect and trust in their colleagues and that we build the right kind of company culture. However, making sure people take responsibility for their own actions (or lack of them) is also very important.</p> <p><strong>What online resource can you not do your job without?</strong></p> <p>Google Reader \u2013 I need to keep a close eye on industry news and trends, and I subscribe to a lot of blogs.</p> <p><strong>What in social media is exciting you the most at the moment?</strong></p> <p>The change in attitude from the media towards Facebook since its IPO is certainly making things 'interesting'. But it's the rise of new platforms, such as <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/\" title=\"\">Pinterest</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Tumblr</a>, that's really changing the landscape. They'll never replace Facebook but they are gathering large and very engaged audiences and this has real implications for our clients and the work we do for them.</p> <p><strong>Where do you see social media and digital marketing in the next 5 years?</strong></p> <p>I don't think things will have changed as much as people might expect. Budgets will certainly be much bigger, but brands will still be grappling with the same problems and will still need agencies like us to help solve them.</p> <p><strong>What top tips would you give to a social media / digital marketing professional looking to get to where you are?</strong></p> <p>Being in the right place at the right time really helps. Spend a lot of time thinking about when and where this place and time are, and make sure you're there at the time. But even when you are, you still need a bold plan for success, to believe in yourself and to be prepared to work your arse off \u2013 and to project this onto others.</p> <p><strong>Any last words?</strong></p> <p>Bring people solutions, not problems, and if you stop learning, move on.</p> <p><em>Robin Grant is global MD of We Are Social \u2013 follow the agency on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wearesocial\" title=\"\"><em>@wearesocial</em></a><em> and Robin </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobinGrant\" title=\"\"><em>@RobinGrant</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>They are better known as stealthy killing machines to take out suspected terrorists with pinpoint accuracy. But drones are also being put to more benign use in skies across several continents to track endangered wildlife, spot poachers, and chart forest loss.</p> <p>Although it is still the ''dawn of drone ecology'', as one innovator calls it, these unmanned aerial vehicles are skimming over Indonesia's jungle canopy to photograph orangutans, protect rhinos in Nepal, and study invasive aquatic plants in Florida.</p> <p>Activists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/01/drones-fight-japanese-whalers\" title=\"\">launched a long-range drone in December to locate and photograph a Japanese whaling ship</a> as the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society attempted to block Japan's annual whale hunt in Antarctic waters.</p> <p>Relatively cheap and portable, the drones fill a gap between satellite and manned aircraft imagery and on-the-ground observations, said Percival Franklin at the University of Florida, which has been developing such drones for more than a decade.</p> <p>''The potential uses are almost unlimited,'' said Ian Singleton, director of the <a href=\"http://www.sumatranorangutan.org/content-n31-sE.html\" title=\"\">Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme</a>, testing drones this year over Indonesia's Tripa peat forest where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/28/sumatran-orangutans-dying-indonesia-forest-fire\" title=\"\">fires set by palm oil growers are threatening the world's highest density habitat of the great apes</a>.</p> <p>Conservation is one of the latest roles for these multitaskers, either autonomously controlled by on-board computers or under remote guidance of a navigator. Ranging in size from less than half a pound to more than 20 tonnes, drones have been used for firefighting, road patrols, hurricane tracking, and other jobs too dull, dirty, or dangerous for piloted craft.</p> <p>Most prominently, they have been harnessed by the US military in recent years, often to detect and kill terrorism targets in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and elsewhere.</p> <p>A conservation drone pioneer, Lian Pin Koh of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, says the idea came to him after another sweaty, jungle slog in Sabah, Malaysia, hauling heavy equipment for his field work.</p> <p>''I told my assistant, who happened to be my wife, 'How wonderful it would be if we could fly over that area rather than walk there again tomorrow,'\u2009'' recalled the Singaporean expert on tropical deforestation, and a model plane hobbyist.</p> <p>Ecodrones in the US are mostly custom-built or commercial models. Koh last year cobbled together a far cheaper, off-the-shelf version that poorer organisations and governments in the developing world can better afford.</p> <p>He and partner Serge Wich bought a model plane \u2013 some are available in China for as little as $100 (\u00a368) \u2013 added an autopilot system, opensource software to programme missions, and still and video cameras. All for less than $2,000 (\u00a31,275), or 10 times cheaper than some commercial vehicles with similar capabilities.</p> <p>This year, they have flown more than 200 mostly test-runs in Asia using an improved version with a 6.5ft wingspan, air time of 45 minutes, and a 15.5-mile range.</p> <p>The drones were flown over rough terrain in Malaysia where GPS-collared elephants are difficult to monitor from the ground. In Nepal's Chitwan National Park, the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Nepal Army conducted trials on detecting rhino and elephant poachers.</p> <p>''Counting orangutan nests is the main way of surveying orangutan populations,'' said Graham Usher of the Sumatran project, which captured one of the apes atop a palm tree feeding on palm heart in a sharp photograph. From higher altitudes the drones, he said, also provide high-resolution, real-time images showing where forests are being cleared and set ablaze.</p> <p>By contrast, ground expeditions are time-consuming, logistically cumbersome, and expensive. A conventional orangutan census in Sumatra, which may also involve helicopters and aircraft, costs some $250,000 (\u00a3159,000). Surveying land use by satellite is likewise costly and hampered by frequent cloud cover over tropical areas.</p> <p>But there are drawbacks with drones, including landing them in often thickly vegetated areas since they need clear touch-down zones of about 100-by-100 yards. Koh said he was working to rig the vehicle with a parachute to allow landing in confined space.</p> <p>Franklin, at the University of Florida, said the hardware and image interpretation are still being developed as more missions are planned in the US, ranging from counting pygmy rabbit burrows in Idaho to monitoring salmon-eating seabirds off the Oregon coast.</p> <p>The University of Florida is testing another antiterrorism weapon, thermal imaging, to hunt for Burmese pythons invading the state's Everglades, having found the snakes regulate temperatures of their nests in a way that makes them visible through such technology.</p> <p>Other eyes-in-the-sky increasingly used for conservation tasks are ultralights, birdlike craft with a major advantage over drones \u2013 the human touch.</p> <p>''It's the closest thing we have come to flying like birds 30,000 years after coming out of caves,'' says Mark Silverberg, preparing to take a reporter up in a paramotor ultralight, one earlier hired by conservation groups to photograph and video Mekong River dolphins, tiger habitat in Myanmar, and denuded hills in northern Thailand.</p>",
  "<p>When Spanish mayor Juan Manuel S\u00e1nchez Gordillo <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/15/spanish-robin-hood-sanchez-gordillo\" title=\"\">recently led farmers on a supermarket sweep</a>, raiding the local shops for food as part of a campaign against austerity, his political immunity as an elected assembly member protected him from arrest. He now asks other local mayors to ignore central government demands for budget cuts and refuse to implement evictions and lay-offs. In this era of austerity, such flagrant disrespect for the law ought to be encouraged. Sometimes, the greatest strength of popular movements is their capacity to disrupt. So here, for the benefit of imaginative <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%932012_Spanish_protests\" title=\"\"><em>indignados</em></a>, are five examples of civil disobedience.</p> <h2>1. Salt March</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394942696\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345223452298/Salt-March-008.jpg\" alt=\"Salt March\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mahatma Gandhi led the Salt March in protest against the government monopoly on salt production.

Gandhi and his supporters began a long, expanding march to produce salt and transport it without paying the tax. It did not stop the practice: the British suppressed the march fiercely, arresting tens of thousands, and refused to make any concessions. It was also limited by its failure to win Muslim support.</p> <p>However, the campaign had long-term effects that weighed against its failure to win its immediate goals. In the first instance, it was inspiring for those taking part, since many had never been organised before. Second, it announced to the world that the Indian masses were a serious force, and that the British authorities had been forced to negotiate with their leader. Third, it stimulated further waves of civil disobedience. Finally, the Salt March had a tremendous influence on the thinking and strategy of other insurgents, such as Martin Luther King.</p> <h2>2. Extremadura campaign</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394942697\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/20/1345456819428/Extremadura--008.jpg\" alt=\"Extremadura \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farms in Extremadura were occupied by unemployed peasants during the 1936 election campaign.

High countryside unemployment contributed to the election of the leftist Popular Front government. In Extremadura, during the 1936 election campaign, Popular Front candidates had promised quick land reform. Rather than wait for the government to deliver on its pledges, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremadura_campaign\" title=\"\">unemployed peasants began to occupy large estates</a>, starting with some 3,000 farms in the Badajoz province. The government, faced with popular unrest, legalised the early occupations. Hundreds of thousands of peasants were re-settled.</p> <p>But it was not just a question of taking over the land. There was a debate about what should be done with it \u2013 whether it should be collectivised or allotted to individual owners. The seizures provided not just land and work, but also a democratic forum, a focus for arguments about the whole future development of the society. Or so it was until the nationalist forces of General Franco conquered the territory and slaughtered the peasants and their leftist leaders.</p> <h2>3.

A wave of militancy during the Great Depression produced legal and institutional support for US workers for the first time.</p> <p>Unorganised workers in textile plants and coal mines, hammered by the recession but also inspired by Franklin Roosevelt's promise to look after industrial workers, began a series of desperate struggles against pay cuts and job losses. But in order to win, they had to opt for the most disruptive tactics, weathering the violence of strikebreakers, police and in some states the imposition of martial law.</p> <p>Enter the \"flying squadrons\" of pickets marching from town to town during the <a href=\"http://www.arete-designs.com/southernprimer/textile.html\" title=\"\">textile strike of 1934</a>, urging workers to walk out. This was particularly important because these workers were often distributed in small production facilities, and had little industrial muscle by themselves. A second key moment was a series of sit-ins by workers in steel and auto factories. This involved workers obstructing production simply by occupying a strategic area of a plant and refusing to move: a highly effective tactic that was also less violent than the picket lines and was later used by civil rights and anti-Vietnam war campaigners.</p> <h2>4.

France was always a different matter, as public distaste for its <a href=\"http://dictionary.reverso.net/french-english/malbouffe\" title=\"\"><em>malbouffe</em></a> was widespread. The chain's attempt to open a branch in Millau in 1999 aroused the interest of Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, a militant farmer and member of the agricultural union Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Paysanne. Before the branch was fully built, Bov\u00e9 and his supporters <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1171329.stm\" title=\"\">arrived and began to dismantle it</a>, brick by brick.</p> <p>Such actions are largely symbolic. But Bov\u00e9's was just one of a wider series of stunts disrupting the purveyors of GM and junk food flooding the French market. These actions brought to the fore not just Bov\u00e9, but an entire layer of agricultural activists. They formed a significant part of the anti-capitalist movement and later joined the struggle against the European constitutional treaty, as part of the coalition that delivered the \"No\" vote.</p> <h2>5. Poll tax non-payment</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394942700\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345223873582/poll-tax-demo-001.jpg\" alt=\"poll tax demo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A network of anti-poll-tax campaigns brought protesters together. Photograph: Denis Thorpe</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Thorpe/taken from picture library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most dramatic moment in the anti-poll tax campaign may well have been the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8593158.stm\" title=\"\">riot arising from a 200,000-strong protest</a> in central London on 31 March 1990. The police, quite unusually, came out on the losing side. While symbolically important, it arose from a series of tactical failures. You can surprise the authorities every once in a while, but they learn from their mistakes and incorporate the lessons into future plans. What is important is that underlying such spontaneous actions is a much more durable form of civil disobedience.</p> <p>In the case of the poll tax, a nationwide network of campaigns and non-payment unions had developed. These groups brought people who were ordinarily isolated, or not politically active, together. Their strategy was to resist at every step: refusing to register for the tax, contesting liability orders from the council (thus clogging up the legal system) and finally refusing payment. This was highly effective. Tax collection was ineffective, and the situation was polarised at great expense to the ruling Conservatives, who were forced to depose their leader and retreat from the full legislation.</p> <p>In each of these examples, the key question is neither violence nor non-violence, neither legality, nor illegality; it is disruption. Popular movements are engaged in civil disobedience whenever they recognise the society's dependence on their co-operation, cease co-operating, and actively disrupt its smooth functioning. This moves politicians to spittle-lathered furore. It is the way in which progress is made.</p>",

  "<p>On Sunday lunchtime, Tony Scott drove his car to the Vincent Thomas bridge in the port district of Los Angeles, parked it in the eastbound lane and then leapt to his death in the water below. \"He jumped without hesitation,\" official sources told the press \u2013 and that sounds about right. We shall probably never know what prompted the 68-year-old film-maker \u2013 a Hollywood titan, rich as Croesus and respected by his peers \u2013 to take his own life. But having made the decision, Scott was not the sort to equivocate. In films and in life, the man went at things headlong. He left the doubt and the navel-gazing to the arthouse crowd. He jumped without hesitation.</p> <p>\"I'm more classical and he's rock'n'roll,\" Ridley Scott once remarked of his younger brother, who followed him into the business after training in fine art. \"Come work with me and within a year you'll have a Ferrari,\" Ridley told him, knowing Tony's abiding weakness for sleek, streamlined, full-throttle hardware. Scott Jr went on to direct hundreds of TV commercials, helping to bankroll Senior's budding career as a feature film-maker while honing his own style below the radar. He made his feature debut on the lustrous <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/84614/hunger\" title=\"\">The Hunger</a> (a rare Tony Scott flop that went on to become a cult favourite) and then hit the jackpot with 1986's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/78743/top.gun\" title=\"\">Top Gun</a>, that boisterous salute to the American military and Tom Cruise's dentistry. Top Gun spun its $15m investment into a $350m return. The US Navy set up recruitment booths in the cinemas. Following Top Gun, Scott (born into a working-class North Shields family) could have bought a whole fleet of Ferraris along with his own racetrack to drive them round.</p> <p>His film-making style was a very 80s breed of rock'n'roll: supple, glossy and smart, a reaction to the self-conscious noodling of 70s prog-rock. \"I have a very short attention span,\" he once admitted, proudly claiming that he worked hard to make sure that all of his pictures came in under two hours. By the end of the 20th century, he was arguably the poster boy for populist Hollywood film-making, the master craftsman of the studio system, flogging high-concept thrills with a dizzying panache. He cranked up the volume for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGk2Hr3GcS8\" title=\"\">Days of Thunder</a>, brought down the stadium in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVrsGHs2MCk\" title=\"\">The Last Boy Scout</a> and rode the audience towards armageddon on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjRxdrg9BtU\" title=\"\">Crimson Tide</a>.</p> <p>What films should we remember him for? In terms of global impact, it's hard to see beyond Top Gun \u2013 surely the emblematic picture of the Reagan era; a film that showcased and celebrated a resurgent super-power, back from the mess of Vietnam and comfortable on its throne again. In terms of artistry, though, one is more likely to opt for the dashing Crimson Tide, the electrifying <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/34907/enemy.of.the.state\" title=\"\">Enemy of the State</a>, or (especially) the superb <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77113/true-romance\" title=\"\">True Romance</a> \u2013 a flushed, playful and intoxicating road movie, whisked with devilish aplomb out of an early script by Quentin Tarantino. But today, more than any other, I find myself drawn back to his lovely screen debut on his brother's 1962 short <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2010/sep/24/shane-meadows-ridley-scott-early\" title=\"\">Boy and Bicycle</a>.

  "<p>A publishing revelation, The Epicure's Almanack of 1815 was the first London good food guide. A topographic encyclopaedia of eating houses, it revealed \"where a man might readily regale himself, according to the relative state of his appetite and purse\". It was the Herculean labour of one man, the poet, playwright and manic depressive Ralph Rylance. As an excellent and readable <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Epicures-Almanack-Drinking-Original-Guidebook/dp/0712358617/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345203664&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\">new edition edited by Janet Ing Freeman</a> shows, Rylance tirelessly chronicled more than 650 eating houses (the word \"restaurant\" was obscure in 1815) from oyster rooms to boiled beef houses, dockyard taverns to coffeehouses, ancient coaching inns to London's first Indian restaurant. Of the 650 entries a paltry 15 remain in business today, even if the interiors of some have been remodelled. Yet, if the claims of innumerable \"ye olde\" pubs are to be believed, virtually every other London pub hails from an oblique and distant past. So where are the genuinely historic places to eat and drink in London? The following list are personal favourites that might not feature on a tourist's radar \u2013 it's by no means exhaustive \u2013 and four establishments make brief appearances in the Almanack.</p> <h2>Old Bell Tavern, Fleet Street</h2> <p>Since medieval times, \"that tippling street, distinguished by the name of Fleet\" was renowned for its profusion of taverns. The Bell Tavern was built by Sir Christopher Wren in the 1670s for builders working on his \"wedding cake\" Church of St Bride's, which looms over the pub. It soon attracted hacks and inkies (printers) working in Fleet Street's burgeoning newspaper industry, many of whom scrawled out their copy while perennially hammered. Today it's a less clammy and less touristy alternative to its near-neighbour, the Cheshire Cheese. The front has colourful stained-glass windows and a stone floor, which gives it an appropriately medieval feel. By the bar, a framed copy of a Daily Mail proclaims \"St Paul's stands unharmed in the midst of the burning city\", published the morning after the Blitz. The hacks have long-since vanished, displaced by office workers and the odd tourist but, as the Almanack observed in 1815, \"the beverages are good, and the [dinner] charges moderate\". <br>\u2022 <em>95 Fleet Street, EC4. 020-7583 0216, </em><a href=\"http://www.nicholsonspubs.co.uk/theoldbelltavernfleetstreetlondon/\" title=\"\"><em>nicholsonspubs.co.uk</em></a></p> <h2>The Lamb, Lamb's Conduit Street </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-457101264\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345121479980/The-Lamb-pub-in-Lambs-Con-010.jpg\" alt=\"The Lamb pub in Lambs Conduit Street, London\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> Photograph: Roberto Herrett/Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Herrett/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On a leisurely Georgian street, nestling behind an 18th-century facade, is this beautifully-preserved Victorian pub. Faded photographs of Victorian actresses (\"Miss Fanny Ward\", \"Miss Violet Friend\"\u2026) line the walls alongside framed Hogarth paintings, reflecting the layers of history that meet here. There's a muscular polyphone (the Victorian equivalent of a jukebox) in the corner but by far the most intriguing survival are the eye-level snob screens \u2013 revolving glazed glass panels \u2013 on either side of the counter. In an era obsessed with social stratification, they ensured that the respectable classes didn't have to suffer the sight of lowly bar staff when they ordered their drinks \u2013 or vice-versa should, say, the landlord come into contact with a member of the Great Unwashed. Today a less snobbish crowd of liberal, literary Bloomsbury locals, American tourists, and office workers take in the atmosphere and the impressive range of real ales and \"amazing couscous soup\" on offer. <br>\u2022 <em>94 Lamb's Conduit Street, WC1, 020-7405 0713, </em><a href=\"http://www.youngs.co.uk/pub-detail.asp?PubID=421\" title=\"\"><em>youngs.co.uk</em></a></p> <h2>The George and Vulture Tavern, Cornhill </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-457101272\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345218369090/The-George-and-Vulture-pu-010.jpg\" alt=\"The George and Vulture pub, London\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Beatrice Wilford</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dr Matthew Green</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every unusual tavern name tells a story and the George and Vulture \u2013 tucked away in a labyrinth of dark alleys surrounding St Michael's Churchyard, and known for its associations with Dickens \u2013 is no exception. Established in the 1470s as the George Inn, it was reduced to a smouldering wreck by the Great Fire. When it was rebuilt, the landlord agreed to lease part of it to a local wine merchant who'd lost his own shop. The only hiccup was his sign \u2013 a live vulture, which he promptly tethered above the entrance to the George. Its squawking and flapping so alarmed customers that the leaseholders decided to absorb the name \"vulture\" and, after years of captivity, release the beast into the sky. Today, the dusky wooden interior (described in the Almanack as \"an established old tavern [with] commodious dining rooms\") feels like a time capsule from the 18th century, but it's a lunchtime restaurant, only open during the week. It serves much the same hearty fare as it did 200 years ago \u2013 steak and kidney pie, roast beef, and Welsh rarebit \u2013 at the kind of prices that mainly suit City workers on their lunch break. <br>\u2022 <em>3 Castle Court, EC3, 020-7626 9710, no official website but owned by Sam Smith's Brewery</em></p> <h2>Ye Olde Mitre Tavern, Holborn</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-457101265\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345126004950/Ye-Olde-Mitre-Clerkenwell-010.jpg\" alt=\"Ye Olde Mitre, Clerkenwell, London\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ye Olde Mitre, Clerkenwell, London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coming here on the day I handed in my PhD, I associate Ye Olde Mitre Tavern with bacchanalian release \u2013 as Elizabeth I must have done, when she allegedly danced around its cherry tree with Sir Christopher Hatton. But the overriding sensation felt by most first-time visitors is frustration. Down a narrow, blink-and-you-miss-it alley in Holborn, it's not easy to find \u2013 but it's a hidden gem. Awaiting you is a graceful courtyard festooned with colourful flowers, barrel-tables and, unusually, an outside toilet. A giant board screams \"established 1546\" as though to justify the pub's \"Ye Olde\" epithet. And sure enough, inside the pub you'll find Tudor-style panelling, windows, fireplaces and snugs \u2013 actually the result of a Tudor-style facelift in the 1930s. The current building hails from 1773 not 1546. The earlier Mitre Tavern was founded to provide some R&amp;R for the servants of the Bishop of Ely, who resided nearby. Today it's Crown property and serves an impressive range of ales and plenty of pies and stews to mop it up. <br>\u2022 <em>1 Ely Court, Ely Place, EC1, 020-7405 4751, </em><a href=\"http://yeoldemitreholburn.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>yeoldemitreholburn.co.uk</em></a></p> <h2>Barley Mow, Marylebone</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-457101266\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345125894566/The-Barley-Mow-pub-Maryle-010.jpg\" alt=\"The Barley Mow pub, Marylebone, London\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Barley Mow pub, Marylebone, London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There's nothing worse, when you're trying to enjoy a quiet pint with a friend, than raucous drunks nearby. But the Barley Mow, built in 1791, offers a unique solution. It boasts a pair of wooden drinking boxes, attached to the left-hand side of the bar. Here, groups of up to five people can cocoon themselves away and drink in complete privacy. Sitting in the cubicles today feels surreal, like sneaking a pint into church. But in Victorian pubs they were ubiquitous, allowing drinkers to mingle exclusively with their social equals. This is why so many Victorian bars are U-shaped: with the interior carved up into booths, it was the only way the barman could reach everyone. The two booths here are a rare survival; different types of screens can be seen in the <a href=\"http://www.pubs.com/main_site/pub_details.php?pub_id=182\" title=\"\">Princess Louise in Holborn</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.nicholsonspubs.co.uk/theargyllarmsoxfordcircuslondon/\" title=\"\">Argyll Arms behind Oxford Circus</a>.

Before tea became affordable in the mid-19th century, London was a city of coffee addicts. The coffeehouse opened by Thomas Twining in 1706, one of three clustered in Devereux Court, was one of the earliest tea retailers (another being Garraway's coffeehouse in Exchange Alley). More than 300 years later, it's still trading from exactly the same spot long after tea eclipsed the \"bitter Mohammedan gruel\" as the English's preferred non-alcoholic drink. Walking underneath its 19th-century portico, watch out for a lion flanked by two Chinamen, a reminder of the exotic status of tea.

Don't be fooled by its name: it's one of London's oldest surviving chop houses. As a French traveller observed, in chop houses gentlemen ordered \"beef, mutton, veal, pork and lamb; you have what quantity you please cut off, fat, lean, much or little done\", hence \"chop house\". It was opened in 1757 by fish purveyor Thomas Simpson and soon became a magnet for local bankers, stockbrokers, and Lloyd's workers who relished a hearty midday dinner; the Almanack draws attention to its \"sumptuous larder\". Brass railings were installed for City gentlemen to hang their top hats. More than 250 years later, nothing much has changed. the food heartier and meatier than ever: not just chops but pies, stews, and roasts: in short, a vegetarian's worst nightmare (although fish is on offer).

Established in the 1890s, in the vaults of long-demolished Georgian houses (one of which was once occupied by Samuel Pepys), the wine bar remains true to its original spirit (smoking excepted). Customers sit around rickety wooden tables with flickering candles sparking a sense of intrigue. There's no beer in sight but a panoply of wine is sold alongside sherry, madeira and port served from the barrel \u2013 to be ordered with mature cheese for maximum indulgence.

He drank here, overlooking the river Thames in the Prospect of Whitby, or \"Devil's Tavern\" as it was formerly known, as commemorated by a noose hanging from a window. The original building is early 16th century (its original flagstone floor survives) but its facade was rebuilt 300 years later. The interior, greatly altered over the years, reflects the pub's long association with shipping, piracy, and smuggling. Barrels prop up its bar and chunks of timber ship masts are embedded into the architecture. By far the best place to take in the sweeping view of the Thames is one of the outdoor terraces.

Not because tall people like to obliterate themselves by mixing strong ciders (you can buy five types here) but because its socially-segregated bars and \"sherry rooms\" are separated by punishingly low doors \u2013 absolutely lethal after a few sherries. When the pub was built in 1826, the area was still a rural suburb of London and farmers stopped here for a cheeky ale or two as they herded their cattle to Hyde Park market. Back then, it allegedly offered a clear view of Windsor Castle, some 22 miles away, hence its name. But the view was obscured by Victorian terraces which sprouted en masse over the next century. Perhaps in defiance of the increasingly urban character of Notting Hill, the pub's interior was remoulded in 1933 in a self-consciously rustic English style, replete with panelled oak screens, wooden benches, mahogany shelving and straw tossed about the floor. It still oozes character today and is genuinely welcoming despite the exclusive tone of the area.

  "<p>As we enter the run-up to another new school term, I'd like to correct the misconception that the library is a dying institution. Public libraries have suffered severe cuts in recent years, but we have also seen them evolving into new and often more significant forms, thanks to the commitment and innovation of those in the sector and everyone who recognises the library's essential place and function within the community.</p> <p>The role of the library is particularly significant when it comes to our younger generation. The evolution I mentioned above is building on the long and successful relationship between libraries and children's literature. Children's libraries in the UK have always worked closely with authors, publishers, teachers and parents but close collaboration with a wider range of stakeholders is becoming more important if the library is to remain at the heart of children's literature and literacy \u2013 and by extension, the wider community.</p> <p>Higher education, for example, could have a key role to play in shaping and supporting the library of the future, partnering with local government to deliver shared and improved services that benefit everyone. Universities pride themselves on their excellent resources and it's surprising that it has taken this long to realise that these are assets that could be shared for the greater good, within the wider communities that higher education establishments serve.</p> <p>A brilliant example of this is the partnership between the University of Worcester and Worcestershire County Council to design and construct <a href=\"http://www.thehiveworcester.org/\" title=\"\">the first joint public and university library in Europe</a>, opened in July by the Queen.</p> <p>Deliberately bold in its design, the Hive has put the library at the heart of the city as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/apr/13/constructive-criticism-ikea-stratford\" title=\"\">an iconic building that will attract interest</a> and encourage visitors to see what is inside. While it makes the most of the latest technologies, the core values of children's literacy remain at its heart \u2013 working with teachers, parents, special needs charities, and employing experts in the field to reach out to children.</p> <p>Public libraries and all that they offer \u2013 from free borrowing to the right environment in which to sit and browse, listen to stories or enjoy performances \u2013 remain vital to society. But at a time of cuts, public library services are struggling to offer as much as they once did. That is why it's encouraging to see initiatives such as <a href=\"http://www.ministryofstories.org/\" title=\"\">the Ministry of Stories</a> and <a href=\"http://www.discover.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Discover Story Centre</a> in East London, and Newcastle's <a href=\"http://www.sevenstories.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Seven Stories gallery</a> \u2013 all great examples of a cross-country energy for keeping young people inspired.</p> <p>And it's not just children who benefit. The Ministry of Stories, a creative writing and mentoring centre for young people in East London set up by authors and other creative personalities, is an example of authors spreading the storytelling gospel, but also taking inspiration from children for their own work. Worcester's <a href=\"http://staffweb.worc.ac.uk/andystevo/gdes2000/gdes2000-interim-jan2012/kirsty-f/\" title=\"\">Beeline Storytelling Festival for Children</a>, featuring writers including Michael Rosen, Jacqueline Wilson, Liz Pichon and Maurice Gleitzman, aims for the same.</p> <p>It is vital that authors, publishers and other literary organisations encourage this two way relationship between writers and readers \u2013 libraries have always made it a priority. New developments at the Hive, the revolutionary Idea Stores in several London boroughs and ventures such as the Ministry of Stories are building on this strong heritage.</p> <p>It is widely accepted that children who regularly visit libraries from a very early age, have access to a wide range of books, listen to stories and are read to at home, particularly at bedtime, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/jul/18/poetry-society-resources-parents-teachers\" title=\"\">have improved literacy skills</a>. This is often underestimated in a time of technology and social media. The earlier a child becomes familiar with the power of stories and language, the earlier they learn to read well and fluently, and this remains a significant determinant to future education, employment and opportunities.</p> <p>At a time when reading skills are more important than ever to determining a child's future options in life, we are lucky that children's books, picture books, poetry and nursery rhymes are available in wonderful variety to our children. Libraries keep that variety alive.</p> <p><em>Judith Elkin is emeritus professor of children's literature at the </em><a href=\"http://www.worcester.ac.uk/community/graduation-professor-judith-elkin.html\" title=\"\"><em>University of Worcester</em></a><em> \u2013 follow The Hive </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thehiveworcs\" title=\"\"><em>@TheHiveWorcs</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>As Occupy London activists demonstrate in support of Julian Assange outside the Ecuadorean embassy, an argument has broken out within and around the movement over whether it should be backing the fugitive Wikileaks founder at all.</p> <p>\"Occupy London has still not come to a collective decision about the Assange issue.

What he and that organisation have done is genuinely important, while what the British government has done in the past week is clearly out of order and clearly disproportionate. People have a right to be annoyed about that.\"</p> <p>Colvin agreed that a debate was taking place among supporters of Occupy but added that the movement had always been able to encompass differing view points.</p> <p>She added: \"Of course, to be supportive of Wikileaks is not to downplay questions about violence against a person or rape.\"</p>",

  "<p>It was fantastic to see the NHS and Great Ormond Street hospital being celebrated as a national centrepiece during the Olympic opening ceremony and I, like many others working in the NHS, felt enormous pride.</p> <p>But elsewhere on television, the NHS and its staff can be cast in a less positive light, especially in dramas. Nurses are often portrayed as driven to despair by unrelenting workloads, ungrateful patients, unco-operative colleagues and unappreciative managers. So which is nearer to the truth?</p> <p>If you want to know what NHS staff really think, look at the responses to the <a href=\"http://www.nhsemployers.org/employmentpolicyandpractice/staff-engagement/nhs%20staff%20survey/pages/nhs-staff-survey.aspx\" title=\"\">NHS staff survey</a>.</p> <p>Each year the survey's findings get published and media always <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/20/nhs-staff-survey-health-service\" title=\"\">report the results</a>. These usually focus on the areas where findings are negative, including problems with harassment or violence from patients. Most concerning for individual staff may be the greater pressure they feel under, with almost two thirds reporting working additional hours and three in ten feeling under stress.</p> <p>It's right that the media should scrutinise these important issues. Local NHS employers do likewise very rigorously and we have seen improvements. I still find it appalling that so many of our staff face harassment simply trying to do their jobs. But there is a broadly positive, improving trend.</p> <p>The survey has run for nine years and during this time staff have reported substantial improvements in the NHS working environment and their management.</p> <p>Last year for example, we saw the constant debate over the health bill, significant structural reorganisation affecting hundreds of thousands of staff, and financial pressures impacting the health service. The survey was also being undertaken at the same time as the first national strike in the NHS for a generation.</p> <p>By any benchmark, it was a tough year for staff and their managers, leading many commentators to predict a huge negative impact on the workforce. And yet, once again, the survey recorded some good improvements.</p> <p>In the most recent survey job satisfaction remains positive, with 76% satisfied with the support they get from colleagues and 87% satisfied with the quality of care they are able to provide. We of course won't be happy until it is 100%. More than two-thirds felt supported by their line managers with difficult tasks or personal crises.</p> <p>Quality, safe patient care relies on reporting concerns and 89% now say they would know how to do so. Nine-tenths of staff felt their job made a difference to patients. Almost nine-tenths felt there are opportunities for promotion and career progression.</p> <p>Now 80% of staff say they have received appraisals, compared with 69% two years ago, and those with personal development plans increased to 69%.</p> <p>The overall positive trend indicates that partnerships between unions, employers and staff that have been so good for patients, for staff and employers, are prevailing even during this significant NHS organisational change.</p> <p>The findings are put to good use. They show the variation within organisations and which particular organisations are doing well in certain areas. Their knowledge is then shared to help other parts of the NHS improve their own processes and patient care.</p> <p><em>Dean Royles is director of </em><a href=\"http://www.nhsemployers.org/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>NHS Employers</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-healthcare-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails on NHS innovation.</strong></p>",
  "<p>I am breaking into my holiday because I can't let a fourth witness statement to the Leveson inquiry by Mazher Mahmood pass without a mention.</p> <p>He has been forced into making a second embarrassing climbdown to the inquiry, which calls into question his long-held claims about the number of people prosecuted due to his News of the World articles. </p> <p>It follows <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2012/jul/16/mazher-mahmood-sundaytimes\">an internal investigation ordered by Sunday Times editor John Witherow</a>, his current editor, into Mahmood's previous statements to Leveson.</p> <p>He has claimed for some time that he was responsible for more than 250 successful criminal prosecutions, <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-12-December-2011.txt\">testifying to Leveson last December</a> that the exact total was 261.</p> <p>But the Witherow investigation, conducted by the global law firm, Linklaters, managed to discover proof of only 94 prosecutions.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Fourth-ws-of-Mazher-Mahmood.pdf\">In his new witness statement,</a> Mahmood explains that Linklaters took strenuous steps to verify the facts through researching press cuttings and making requests to various courts and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).</p> <p>He admits that although he kept \"a broad running check\" on the number of prosecutions he did not maintain records and clippings of every case, \"nor was any proper log or record maintained by the News of the World.\"</p> <p>Mahmood (aka the Fake Sheikh) gives a convoluted explanation for the difference between his original claim and the Linklaters total, and apologises for certain errors. He writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I provided to Linklaters details of all of the prosecutions which I could recall that predated my first statement. This list exceeded 253 prosecutions, as I believed the number included in my first statement to be a conservative estimate...</p> <p>The details I provided to Linklaters included the following cases:</p> <p><strong>a.</strong> Over 134 different criminal offences committed prior to the date of my first statement and carried out by 94 individuals... </p> <p>I should make clear here that... I would generally count separate charges on which an individual had been convicted on the same occasion as multiple convictions, if they were for what I considered different offences. For example, someone convicted of carrying a firearm who was also convicted for possession of drugs I would count separately.</p> <p><strong>b.</strong> Over 140 illegal immigrants who I believe were deported as a result of my work, although I did not keep a record of their names. My understanding was that an illegal immigrant commits a crime by being present in this country... I now understand from Linklaters that it is unlikely that these individuals would have been the subject of criminal prosecutions per se...</p> <p>That is not something which I was previously aware of, and I apologise for my error...</p> <p><strong>c.</strong> 13 individuals who were barred from their professions or by their relevant sporting bodies, or dismissed by the police or prison service, in connection with allegations of criminal conduct, which were exposed as a result of my work. </p> <p>Again, I understand from Linklaters that such actions do not amount to prosecutions or convictions and so I apologise to the inquiry for including these individuals in my first statement.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Mahmood goes on to explain that some courts and the CPS were unwilling to provide the necessary data, adding that he remains \"personally confident\" that his work \"led to substantially more convictions than the 94 individuals which Linklaters has been able to verify independently.\"</p> <p>But his statement has been met with extreme scepticism by Paddy French, the journalist who <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Witness-statement-of-Paddy-French-including-exhibits.pdf\">made a formal complaint to the Leveson inquiry about Mahmood's claims.</a> </p> <p>French, who runs an investigative website called <a href=\"http://www.rebeccatelevision.com/\">Rebecca Television</a>, had conducted a comprehensive search of the News of the World's archive for the 20 years between December 1991, when Mahmood joined the paper, until its closure in July 2011.</p> <p>French alleged in his statement to Leveson that Mahmood \"may have committed perjury\" by overstating the number of successful prosecutions.</p> <p>Now, following the posting of Mahmood's fourth witness statement, French has written to Witherow to say that the Linklaters inquiry findings are closer to his analysis (which found only 70 prosecutions) than Mahmood's 250-plus claim.</p> <p>I have seen a copy of the letter, in which French maintains his position that Mahmood's previous evidence to the committee was questionable. He also says that Rebecca Television is conducting a second piece of investigative work into Mahmood's evidence to Leveson.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for News International confirmed that Mahmood is still employed by the Sunday Times. Asked whether any internal action was being taken against Mahmood and whether Witherow considered his evidence adequate, she said the company had no comment.</p> <p><em><strong>PS:</strong></em> In Mahmood's first witness statement to Leveson, he stated that he left the Sunday Times in 1988 after \"a disagreement.\" I contested that statement and, after being asked by Leveson to provide evidence to support by contention, did so.</p> <p>This led to Mahmood being recalled by the inquiry and conceding that his departure had been due to his having \"acted improperly\". <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-25-January-20121.txt\">Lord Justice Leveson told him he had been disingenuous in his original evidence</a> because he had left the paper after committing an act of dishonesty.</p>",
  "<p>As the summer draws to a close, some of us will still be planning that last-minute getaway. If a member of your family has a learning disability, the chances are you've been planning it for some time. As any parent of a child with special needs will tell you, \"spontaneous\" and \"carefree\" are not words they associate with a holiday.</p> <p>In fact, holidays can be a minefield for some families. Choosing a holiday in the first place is hard. You need to find a venue that is suitable for someone with complex needs. Once you're away, everything is new and unfamiliar, and there are none of the usual support systems you rely on at home.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.netbuddy.org.uk\" title=\"\">Netbuddy</a> has collected the following advice from families of people with learning disabilities. It's a holiday survival guide by people who have been there and earned the T-shirt.</p> <p><strong>Change of routine</strong></p> <p>While most of us relish a break from routine, it can create anxiety and confusion for people with learning disabilities and autism. Without the predictability and structure of a daily schedule, many people with learning disabilities struggle to cope.</p> <p>\"Routines are important in everyone's life,\" says one parent. \"Think about how you feel when you sleep in and miss breakfast. It can make you feel not quite right. That's how my son feels whenever we break his routine.\"</p> <p>Try preparing a holiday routine \u2013 even just a basic structure, like wash, get dressed, breakfast, explore resort, lunch, beach, dinner, bathtime, bed with a story or DVD.</p> <p>Give plenty of notice, explaining what is going to happen the next day and, if possible show photos or postcards of destinations you plan to visit. Make sure there are as few surprises as possible.</p> <p><strong>Sensory overload</strong></p> <p>Many people with learning disabilities have sensory issues, which can cause an over-sensitivity to sights, sounds, tastes, smells and/or touch. This makes some elements in their environment painfully overwhelming \u2013 for example, loud noises, new smells, crowds, bright lights.</p> <p>Holidays can be sensory war zones for people with learning disabilities. Sand, sun, screaming babies, loud discos, crowded coaches, sunburn, melting ice creams \u2026 it can all spell disaster.</p> <p>Do your research. Find out as much as you can about your holiday destination in advance. Know where the quiet zones are and the noise/light/smell hazards \u2013 for example fairgrounds or loud, echoing restaurants with flickering light.</p> <p>Pack a day bag with small sensory objects in it, such as crackly paper, scented bubbles, shiny objects, a small light-up spinning top, magnets, squishy mesh balls, chewy tubes etc. This can help distract when situations become difficult.</p> <p><strong>Unfamiliarity</strong></p> <p>Holidays are all about seeing new sights, trying different foods and doing new things. Many people with learning disabilities and autism get a particular comfort from familiarity. Change can be difficult and holidays may create enormous anxiety in some people, which can lead to challenging behaviour.</p> <p>The key is all in the preparation. Once you've chosen a destination, it's a good idea to start preparing your child as much as possible to reduce the fear of the unknown.</p> <p>Use photos, books and symbols to show every stage of the journey. Collect pictures from the holiday brochure to help your child understand where they're going and what to expect.</p> <p>It may be worth visiting the airport or train station before you go on holiday, to familiarise your child. You could also show pictures and talk about the journey and what happens at each stage \u2013 passport control, baggage check, boarding etc.</p> <p><strong>Sibling battles</strong></p> <p>Most family holidays involve compromise \u2013 juggling everybody's needs so no one gets left out. If your child has learning disabilities, it can be difficult keeping everyone happy. Their needs may take up most of your energy and focus, leaving siblings feeling resentful.</p> <p>Try to make time for activities siblings want to do, even if it's just for an hour or so. They need to feel special and important too. Try taking turns with your partner to do things individually with them.</p> <p>Treat siblings as children, not carers. It can be tempting to rely on them more when you're away, but remember it's their holiday too.</p> <p><strong>Getting lost</strong></p> <p>It's every parent's nightmare \u2013 losing a child on holiday. But when your child or has a learning disability, the problem becomes tenfold. Practice getting lost beforehand. Role play what to do if your child gets lost when you're out and about. Make sure they know how to present their identification card and what to say.</p> <p>Write your contact details, including mobile phone number, on a wristband or attach it to a belt pull or other loop on clothing.

  "<p>Samsung abused its \"monopoly power\" over certain wireless patents and demanded an unreasonable royalty from Apple for their use in the iPhone, hurting the device's commercial prospects, Apple experts testified on Friday as the two sides presented their last pieces of evidence.</p> <p>Richard Donaldson, a former lead patents attorney for Texas Instruments, told the court on Friday that a 2.4% royalty Samsung wanted on the price of the iPhone was discriminatory because the patents in question enabled just a fraction of the smartphone's features.</p> <p>Later, New York University professor Janusz Ordover likened that rate \u2013 equivalent to $14 (\u00a38.90) per $600 iPhone \u2013 to a holdup.</p> <p>Ordover, a former deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said Samsung's conduct distorted the decision making process in setting standards.</p> <p>\"It enabled Samsung's technology to be introduced, to become part of the standard,\" he said. \"They have acquired holdup power.\"</p> <p>Samsung accuses Apple of infringing those patents, which are related to wireless communications for smartphones and are broadly licensed to Intel and other technology corporations.</p> <p>Apple, meanwhile, accuses Samsung of copying the design and some features of its iPad and iPhone.</p> <p>The former Texas Instruments executive joined a string of rebuttal expert witnesses that Apple presented in court in the closing hours of the US legal battle with its South Korean rival.</p> <p>The two sides finally closed their submissions with Samsung having used all 25 hours it was allowed for evidence and cross-examination in the trial, and Apple using all but a minute of its 25 hours.</p> <p>Closing arguments and jury deliberations, neither of which are time-limited, are set to begin this week.</p> <p>The court battle is a facet of a bigger war for supremacy in the mobile market between the two corporations, which sell more than half the world's smartphones. The mobile market is one of fastest growing and most lucrative in the technology sector.</p> <p>In part, Apple's aim is to limit Samsung's explosive growth, which it has testified has seen it lose sales to the South Korean company \u2013 because, Apple's witnesses said, of features copied from the iPhone, though Samsung countered with Apple data suggesting lack of iPhone availability was a key to lost sales.</p> <p>But it is also part of a wider strategic assault on companies selling phones running Google's Android software, which now make up well over half of all smartphones shipped worldwide.</p> <p>If Apple can prevail over some elements of Android software, it could force handset makers to change certain features \u2013 which might cause a confusing diversity of features and implementations of some functions in Android.</p> <p>Google is not directly involved in the trial, but its executives will be watching the outcome closely.</p> <p>Donaldson testified that: \"If other companies were to determine that this is a reasonable royalty, then the total royalty on the iPhone would be something like 50%. It's neither fair nor reasonable because you could not be successful in the market.\"</p> <p>Other expert witnesses included Michael Walker, a former senior Vodafone research executive, who from 2008 to 2011 chaired the European telecoms standards authority. He said Samsung failed to disclose in a timely fashion the patents referred to by Donaldson.</p> <p>During cross examination, Samsung lawyer Charles Verhoeven probed the idea that trade secrets and confidential information were exempt from a requirement for full and timely disclosure.</p> <p>In any case, the South Korean company had never come under scrutiny from the standards-setting agency on that issue, he said.</p> <p>The courtroom battle has transfixed insiders since July. Apple is demanding more than $2.5bn in damages and a sales ban on certain Samsung smartphones and tablets, while its rival is demanding licensing fees.</p> <p>Samsung also says Apple's damages should be calculated not on gross margins, but after all other costs \u2013 such as marketing \u2013 are factored in.</p> <p>The trial in San Jose, in the heart of Silicon Valley in California, has offered glimpses into the two huge corporate machines \u2013 from their design and marketing processes to the profits they make on devices.</p> <p>Tensions have run high with so much at stake, but the trial has offered some levity.</p> <p>Judge Lucy Koh asked whether Apple lawyer Bill Lee was smoking crack after he presented a 75-page list of witnesses with only minutes left on Apple's \"clock\" \u2013 a quip that came up again to much good-natured chuckling, including from Lee himself, on Friday.</p> <p>Friday's testimony centred on the concept of standards or essential patents \u2013 intellectual property built into a commonly agreed set of specifications \u2013 and in this case, the UMTS wireless communications standard used worldwide by mobile devices.</p> <p>Professor Ordover testified that standards essential patents (SEPs) \u2013 a point of contention in a global market where corporations constantly seek an edge \u2013 had enormous benefits to consumers and manufacturers.</p> <p>But they also had potential risk and could be abused. Ordover argued that Samsung unfairly wielded its two patents against Apple.</p> <p>Such patents are meant to be licensed to all comers on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis, in return for being agreed to be essential to a standard.</p> <p>Apple's lawyers argue that Samsung \u2013 a member of the body that crafted UMTS standards in 2005 \u2013 is charging an unfairly high licensing fee for those patents, in effect trying to stymie market advances.</p> <p>Samsung says the patents are intellectual property for which it rightly requires compensation.</p> <p>As the clock ran down on Samsung's lawyers on Friday, they did not cross-examine many of the Apple witnesses at any length, and in many cases simply chose not to do so.</p> <p>Apple concluded its rebuttal case to Samsung, which had presented its evidence during the week, with just one minute remaining.</p>",
  "<p>The Commons public accounts committee recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/aug/01/government-transparency-public-accounts-committee\" title=\"\">slammed the government's open data policy </a>for releasing too much unintelligible raw data. But releasing more government data is a cornerstone of government policy.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/open-data-white-paper-unleashing-potential\" title=\"\">open data white paper</a>, published in June, states: \"From the prime minister down, central government is committed to making open data an effective engine of economic growth, social wellbeing, political accountability and public service improvement.\"</p> <p>How is this being translated across different public services? We asked public leaders how they are tackling the challenges, and reaping the potential benefits, of making more information available.</p> <p><strong>Councillor Nigel Murphy \u2013 Manchester city council; lead member for Digital Manchester and executive member for environment</strong></p> <p>Manchester is embarking on an ambitious challenge to become an open data friendly city. The UK has lagged behind cities such as New York in releasing and promoting its open data, but now we're seeing public sector bodies begin to realise the importance of open data and how it could benefit residents.</p> <p>Manchester city council, like most public bodies, has some of its data openly available, but nowhere near enough. This has been partly due to non-engagement with the digital community about what creative use of apparently dry data can achieve.</p> <p>Now we are talking to the community and working with partners to give them the data they need to help develop useful mobile and web apps and visualisations that will take Manchester up the digital leagues. This is not just about giving the digital playground something to do, but also driving genuine interest from residents.</p> <p>A first <a href=\"http://opendatamanchester.org.uk/tag/hackathon/\" title=\"\">Hackathon</a> organised by the council and its partners is likely to take place later this year, followed by bigger events in 2013. It's vital that this is not a one-off event. With legacy a buzzword around the country at the moment, the same applies to releasing open data and the encouraging the developer community to pick it up, run with it, develop prototypes and then pass the baton, so they can be developed further at the next events.</p> <p><strong>Carole Willis \u2013 chief scientific adviser, Department for Education</strong></p> <p>We published the new-look <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance/\" title=\"\">school performance tables </a>in December 2011/January 2012, giving parents more information than ever before about how their child's school is performing. In particular, we added 400% more data about secondary schools than in 2010.</p> <p>In one easily accessible website, the performance tables help parents to compare schools at the same stage of education, providing key information needed to support choice. Parents can find out the school type and size, pupil and staff characteristics, and test and exam results for the main Key Stages. There is also information on school finances, for example, spending on teaching staff.</p> <p>This information, part of the government's drive for greater transparency, can help ensure that schools are held to account for the performance of all their pupils. The site has received more than 7.8m hits since they were first published last December, and we are expecting another peak in the autumn as parents use the site to inform the school admissions process.</p> <p><strong>Simon Parr \u2013 chief constable, Cambridgeshire Constabulary</strong></p> <p>The public has a right to access information about policing in their area and my stance is that we as a service need to be as open and transparent as possible. The challenge comes in organising that data in a way that is easily digestible for the masses.</p> <p>Holding back data protects no one and I would much rather allow the public access to too much information in a disorganised manner, than withhold information and provide the minimum in an organised way.</p> <p>The nature of our work means that things are constantly changing and data collated one month can significantly change the next but it's important we share wherever possible. We have a well-established email scheme, <a href=\"https://www.cambs-police.co.uk/myneighbourhood/ecops/index.asp\" title=\"\">e-cops</a>, where local policing teams keep the public up to date on what is happening in their area.</p> <p>The evolution of social media is also presenting us with opportunities to engage and share information with thousands of people and this is an area I am keen to explore further, as we scratch the surface and discover the opportunities that are out there.</p> <p><strong>Tim Kelsey \u2013 national director for patients and information, NHS Commissioning Board</strong></p> <p>Opening up health and care data is key to improving the outcomes and effectiveness of the NHS. Transparency is the hallmark of a modern, 21st-century citizen-centred health service. It empowers accountability and choice and transforms patient and public participation \u2013 individually and communally. Transparency is a fundamental tool for healthcare professionals to drive clinical quality and research.</p> <p>The NHS is committed to being open and transparent about health and social care data. We publish more data than any other system in the world from cancer profiles for GP practices in England to patient complaints for individual NHS Trusts. This is just the start.</p> <p>There is a lot more data in the pipeline that will be made available over the coming months and years and we are working with a range of organisations to help ensure people have access to the necessary support so they can properly understand the data and make the best use out of it.</p> <p>Evidence suggests that opening up data can have a positive effect in improving our care services, our health outcomes \u2013 and can save money. As one very powerful example of this, <a href=\"http://www.scts.org/about/default.aspx\" title=\"\">the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery</a> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/5935355/Death-rate-among-heart-surgery-patients-is-falling.html\" title=\"\">reported </a>that mortality in coronary artery surgery had fallen by a fifth and in aortic valve replacement surgery by a third over five years, as a result of public reporting of outcomes by individual surgeons. Overall, savings outweighed the costs of data collection more than threefold.</p> <p><strong>Francis Maude - minister for the Cabinet Office</strong></p> <p>This is the most open government in British history and we are leading the world on the transparency agenda. In June I published the <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/open-data-white-paper-unleashing-potential\" title=\"\">open data white paper</a>, explaining how making anonymised public sector data more accessible and more usable will benefit everyone.</p> <p>We agree with the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/news/transparency-report/\" title=\"\">Commons public accounts committee </a>that open data allows citizens to hold us to account, improve public services, and bolster innovation and growth. Everyone should have access to open data, and that's why we have just overhauled our <a href=\"http://data.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">data.gov.uk </a>site to make it much easier for people to use the data we are releasing.</p> <p>So far, we've published nearly 9,000 datasets across a wide range of areas including transport, crime and justice. Every dataset published is measured against the five-star scheme developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web. The scheme scores the data on how easy it is to understand and use, keeping check on whether we are living up to our promise to make sure that the data provides tangible uses and benefits. Tim is also one of the co-directors for our new Open Data Institute, launching in the autumn, which will ensure we are making the most out of the new data we're publishing.</p> <p>This agenda is here to stay and it's happening across the whole spectrum of government. Departments have published their own open data strategies with a clear timetable of what datasets people can expect to be released and when. The prize at stake \u2013 better public services and a more prosperous UK \u2013 is just too good to ignore.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.
