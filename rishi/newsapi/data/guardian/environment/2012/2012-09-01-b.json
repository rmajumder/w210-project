[
  "<p>Last week, science took pride of place alongside the athletes at the opening ceremony of the Paralympics. Under the guidance of the extraordinary Stephen Hawking, Prospero took Miranda and the rest of us on a voyage of scientific discovery, celebrating the Enlightenment that brought rationality to unlock the secrets of nature and to advance the rights of man.</p> <p>This wonderful ceremony highlighted the achievement of human will in overcoming the adversity of disability and tackling the difficult problems of science. And it brought home to those of us who live on these \"Isles of Wonder\" that Britain was the birthplace of the Paralympics, and through the efforts of the Royal Society in the 17th century was also the birthplace of modern science.</p> <p>Science has done much to improve everyone's lives and has had a part to play in bringing us the great celebration of sport happening in London this summer. Ludwig Guttmann, the father of the Paralympic Games, a scientist and fellow of the Royal Society, was one of the first to recognise the important role sport can play in managing disability; science also underpins the medical and technological advances that help Paralympians in their athletics.</p> <p>Involving Stephen Hawking in the opening ceremony celebrated science's equivalent of a Paralympian, a man who has not let disability stand in the way of great achievement. He emphasised the burning curiosity of scientists and the wonder of the science they do \u2013 how Newton could link the fall of an apple with the movement of the planets, uniting the local with the universal.</p> <p>What has been good about the strong scientific element of the summer's ceremonies in Stratford is that although we have been good at science in Britain for the last 350 years we have not always been so quick to celebrate it.</p> <p>So how is science doing today? The answer is that it is doing pretty well. We saw Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, at the Olympic opening ceremony; we have the magnificent machine of the Large Hadron Collider searching for the ultimate nature of matter, a symbol of what humankind can achieve when it works together; we have the robot Curiosity roaming the surface of Mars searching for clues that life may have existed on another planet; we see the achievements of human genome sequencing bringing us insights into disease and what it is to be human. British scientists and scientists working in Britain have made and are making important contributions to these achievements and many more.</p> <p>Science is undergoing a resurgence in popularity in Britain. As well as the Olympics and Paralympics, in recent weeks we have also seen an ongoing upward trend in the numbers taking science subjects at both GCSE and A-level, and the government is strongly supportive of the teaching of science in schools (although we have to be careful that the loosening of curriculum requirements in free schools does not lead to problems in certain faith schools, where evidence-based science such as evolution runs counter to faith-based opinion).</p> <p>Science is becoming a more noticeable element of the TV schedules, with the redoubtable David Attenborough still building on nearly 50 years of explaining the wonders of the natural world and with Brian Cox and his hugely successful recent TV series. Then there are the inspirational popular science books such as those of Richard Dawkins and Martin Rees.</p> <p>Science is also key to the government's narrative on economic growth. Political pronouncements regularly note the role of science, engineering and innovation in sustainable economic growth.</p> <p>But most important is that we are really good at doing science in Britain. We have less than 1% of the world's population and 3% of the global funding for research, but we produce 8% of the world's research papers and 14% of the highest-impact papers. The Americans produce more but they also spend quite a lot more on it.</p> <p>We are world leaders in science and we should be proud of it. We need science now more than ever. It does provide the knowledge needed for the innovation that ultimately drives sustainable economic growth. George Osborne and Vince Cable need to ensure that science is at the forefront of their strategy for economic recovery. We need to invest in our science base if we are to stay ahead of our competitors.</p> <p>As well as being crucial for our economy, science is needed to improve our health and our quality of life. It can help solve the world's biggest problems: global health, water sustainability, providing enough food for the world, managing climate change. It influences nearly everything we do. The better we are at science, the better our lives will be, both here in Britain and in the rest of the world.</p> <p>Last Wednesday night, Prospero left the stage telling us that our greatest adventures still lie ahead and that is why it matters that we take science to our hearts and place it at the centre of our culture and our economy. The Paralympics opening ceremony was entitled \"Enlightenment\". The Enlightenment embodied curiosity and rationality, leading eventually to enrichment of our culture, to improvements in our health and quality of life, to democracy and the rights of man. It is time now for a new Enlightenment, one in which science must play its proper part.</p> <p>Science is and has always been one of Britain's greatest assets and I am confident that the time has come for a new deal between science and society.</p> <p>We have always been a pro-science nation but in typical understated British fashion we have not shouted about it. But recently there have been quite a few signs that we are becoming a little more proud of our past and current achievements.</p> <p>If we capitalise on the current surge of interest in science we can make this new Enlightenment a reality and, I believe, make the world a better place.</p>",
  "<p>The immorality of the United States and Great Britain's decision to invade Iraq in 2003, premised on the lie that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, has destabilised and polarised the world to a greater extent than any other conflict in history.</p> <p>Instead of recognising that the world we lived in, with increasingly sophisticated communications, transportations and weapons systems necessitated sophisticated leadership that would bring the global family together, the then-leaders of the US and UK fabricated the grounds to behave like playground bullies and drive us further apart. They have driven us to the edge of a precipice where we now stand \u2013 with the spectre of Syria and Iran before us.</p> <p>If leaders may lie, then who should tell the truth? Days before George W Bush and Tony Blair ordered the invasion of Iraq, I called the White House and spoke to Condoleezza Rice, who was then national security adviser, to urge that United Nations weapons inspectors be given more time to confirm or deny the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Should they be able to confirm finding such weapons, I argued, dismantling the threat would have the support of virtually the entire world. Ms Rice demurred, saying there was too much risk and the president would not postpone any longer.</p> <p>On what grounds do we decide that Robert Mugabe should go the International Criminal Court, Tony Blair should join the international speakers' circuit, bin Laden should be assassinated, but Iraq should be invaded, not because it possesses weapons of mass destruction, as Mr Bush's chief supporter, Mr Blair, confessed last week, but in order to get rid of Saddam Hussein?</p> <p>The cost of the decision to rid Iraq of its by-all-accounts despotic and murderous leader has been staggering, beginning in Iraq itself. Last year, an average of 6.5 people died there each day in suicide attacks and vehicle bombs, according to the <a href=\"http://www.iraqbodycount.org/\" title=\"\">Iraqi Body Count project</a>. More than 110,000 Iraqis have died in the conflict since 2003 and millions have been displaced. By the end of last year, nearly 4,500 American soldiers had been killed and more than 32,000 wounded.</p> <p>On these grounds alone, in a consistent world, those responsible for this suffering and loss of life should be treading the same path as some of their African and Asian peers who have been made to answer for their actions in the Hague.</p> <p>But even greater costs have been exacted beyond the killing fields, in the hardened hearts and minds of members of the human family across the world.</p> <p>Has the potential for terrorist attacks decreased? To what extent have we succeeded in bringing the so-called Muslim and Judeo-Christian worlds closer together, in sowing the seeds of understanding and hope?</p> <p>Leadership and morality are indivisible. Good leaders are the custodians of morality. The question is not whether Saddam Hussein was good or bad or how many of his people he massacred. The point is that Mr Bush and Mr Blair should not have allowed themselves to stoop to his immoral level.</p> <p>If it is acceptable for leaders to take drastic action on the basis of a lie, without an acknowledgement or an apology when they are found out, what should we teach our children?</p> <p>My appeal to Mr Blair is not to talk about leadership, but to demonstrate it. You are a member of our family, God's family. You are made for goodness, for honesty, for morality, for love; so are our brothers and sisters in Iraq, in the US, in Syria, in Israel and Iran.</p> <p>I did not deem it appropriate to have this discussion at the Discovery Invest Leadership Summit in Johannesburg last week. As the date drew nearer, I felt an increasingly profound sense of discomfort about attending a summit on \"leadership\" with Mr Blair. I extend my humblest and sincerest apologies to Discovery, the summit organisers, the speakers and delegates for the lateness of my decision not to attend.</p>",
  "<p>After years of decline, the British wool industry is making a comeback thanks, in part, to luxury fashion's newfound love of suits, formalwear and knitwear.</p> <p>Premier Vision \u2013 the most important fabric show for the fashion industry \u2013 features a knitwear section for the first time this year. The Woolmark prize, won by Karl Lagerfeld and Yves Saint Laurent in the 1950s, has been relaunched and fashion students are being encouraged to concentrate on knitwear through an initiative supported by the Prince of Wales. The knock-on effect has seen British mill production increase by 12% in 2011, and the amount of wool produced in the UK increase from 32,000 tonnes in 2009 to 40,000 tonnes in 2011.</p> <p>Wool was once a staple clothing material, but from the mid-1970s use declined. \"It wasn't that men's formalwear abandoned wool,\" explains Peter Ackroyd, a global strategic adviser for Woolmark, \"but that men abandoned formalwear.\" As British production costs spiralled, wool manufacture moved first to Turkey, then China. \"In its heyday,\" says Ackroyd, \"70,000 people worked in the worsted weaving industry in Britain, now there's between 5,000 and 7,000 depending on the season.\"</p> <p>The British companies that survived the downturn mainly have the luxury market to thank. They were the spinners and weavers who specialised in men's formalwear fabrics \u2013 overcoats and suits \u2013 or niche production of quality materials and tweeds for high-end fashion houses. These skills have now paid off as classic styles of UK heritage brands have swung back into fashion. Traditional British names such as Burberry, Dunhill and Barbour posted record turnovers in 2011. The comforting fabrics associated with these labels are also enjoying popularity with women's fashion designers: tweed sauntered down the autumn/winter 2012 catwalks at Marc Jacobs, Chanel and Michael Kors and is a major trend for high-street retailers such as Jigsaw and Topshop. Men's suits have also become a style statement rather than an enforced uniform for the office.</p> <p>These changes in trends have had a key impact on manufacturing. Fashion manufacturing in the UK has increased from 2% of the country's total output to 2.5%. The wearing of wool has also been boosted by TV performers such as Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l, who plays Sarah Lund, the Danish detective in the thriller series <em>The Killing</em>, and James Morton, the star amateur baker of BBC2's <em>Great British Bake Off</em>. The value of the global wool clothing industry at retailer level has increased by \u00a322m, with global market value rising from \u00a31.2bn in 2009 to \u00a31.42bn in 2011.</p> <p>As Asia becomes a key new market for most brands, being able to label goods \"Made in Britain\" is a major selling point. \"I don't think consumers in emerging markets want to buy something that cost a fortune to find out that it was made in China,\" says Ackroyd.</p> <p>The wool industry is encouraging interest in wool among young designers and fashion students. The Woolmark prize, relaunched in 2008, has helped launch illustrious careers: in 1954 Yves Saint Laurent won the dress category, while Karl Lagerfeld was rewarded for his coat designs. Woolmark hopes the revived award will provide a launchpad for more new young designers. Belgian womenswear designer Christian Wijnants won this year's European award with the UK's JW Anderson and James Long named as runners-up. JW Anderson sees wool as an important part of British tradition: \"It's always relevant and sharp. New techniques have made this traditional fibre very modern.\"</p> <p>Carolyn Massey, head of design for heritage knitwear brand Lyle &amp; Scott, also applauds wool's mutability. \"There's lots of innovation in wool \u2013 people just think of sheep, but we use yak and alpaca as well. It's natural and incredibly flexible, more than many technical yarns.\"</p> <p>The eco-credentials of wool \u2013 natural, renewable, biodegradable, sustainable \u2013 have always been advocated by Prince Charles, patron of the Campaign for Wool. This initiative also strives to get new young designers involved with the fabric with projects such as this year's Wool School. This pairs retailers such as Harvey Nichols, Pringle and Paul Smith with students to help them develop jumpers for sale. The winning sweaters will be available during Wool Week (15-21 October). Topshop, John Lewis, Jigsaw, Hobbs and Marks &amp; Spencer all took part in Wool School, and last week Marks &amp; Spencer launched its Made in Britain range, which includes many items made of British wool. \"M&amp;S is the world's biggest retail buyer of British wool and cloth,\" says Mark Yates, M&amp;S head of innovation and quality for menswear. \"British wool is perfect for many specific garment styles such as worsted suit fabrics and flannels, and the UK industry can now compete with any other country in the world with lighter, finer cloths, too.\"</p> <p>Ackroyd \u2013 whose father's company spun hand-knitted yarns in West Yorkshire \u2013 says: \"Four years ago I was told I was a fool to talk about manufacturing in the UK, but mills are now working longer hours, we're seeing old family businesses, such as James Laxton in Bradford, reopen spinning mills in Yorkshire. Abraham Moon, established in 1837, is diversifying. It's wonderful to see this traditional industry flourish again. Everything feels like it's moving in the right direction.\"</p>",
  "<p>Eight months into the 10-year rendition of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/11/kevin-mckenna-pandas-china-zoos\" title=\"\">Tian Tian and Yang Guang</a> and already we are discovering exquisite new ways of torturing them. Last week, it was Tian Tian's ninth birthday and so the beast-masters at Edinburgh Zoo made a birthday cake for the poor and bewildered panda. It was a three-tiered effort with carrots instead of candles and made to a secret recipe of rice, soya and honey.</p> <p>We can only guess at the reasons why the recipe is \"secret\". Perhaps the zoo has \"secret\" plans to market it as a high-protein and healthy alternative to Mr Kipling's stalwart confections. Unsurprisingly, the birthday girl refused to co-operate. Did anyone ask her if she wanted to mark her big day with an absurd piece of home baking while being watched by hundreds of idiot human beings?</p> <p>The barbaric deal our government struck with the foul Beijing regime to lock up the two giant pandas simply reveals Scotland's perverse attitude to wildlife. For, despite being gifted some of the world's most breathtakingly wild and vivid countryside, we only consider allowing breathtakingly wild creatures to stay here on condition that they are safely locked up.</p> <p>Indeed, even those few majestic species we do allow to bide in Scotland are at risk from gamekeepers, those rural social misfits whom absentee landlords pay to keep their sporting estates well stocked. Thus the nation turns a blind eye when another golden eagle suffers a cruel death by poisoning. In the Highlands and islands, farmers are trying to convince us that no child under the age of five is safe from rampaging sea eagles.</p> <p>These beautiful creatures, which are just as partial to a bit of lamb and pork as the rest of us, must be controlled, say the farmers, or their livelihoods will be damaged.</p> <p>It is a curious quirk of Scottish social life that, while we consider ourselves to be modern, enlightened and socially inclusive we nevertheless permit unimaginable psychological cruelty to be visited on animals each day at places such as Edinburgh Zoo. Fifty years hence, we will all wonder what we were thinking of, paying money to gawp as some of the world's most magnificent creatures die a little each day, padding around a straw-floored detention centre. Perhaps, instead of keeping these disreputable places alive, we could shut them down and turn our national parks and wildernesses into havens for animals that will give us complacent human beings a right good run for our money.</p> <p>For what is the point in conferring national park status on the Cairngorms if we know that there are absolutely no animals in it that could eat you? Or, at the very least, give you a right good kicking if you are not careful or fail to follow the countryside code or neglect to wrap up warm with your name sewn on to your mitts?</p> <p>North America's splendid Yellowstone national park would, quite frankly, be embarrassed to call itself such if there were no bears and wolves in it to keep all the outdoors types on their toes.</p> <p>So, I think the SNP should seriously consider pledging to bring bears, wolves and lynxes back to Scotland's hills and glens. And could we not persuade the WWF to send us over a few tigers? After all, in Scotland they'd be treated with a bit more respect than they are accustomed to in their disappearing habitats elsewhere in the world where they have been poached to the point of extinction.</p> <p>I've heard all those arguments about the ecosystem being completely screwed if we bring back the big beasts. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/nov/28/beaver-escape-scotland-natural-heritage\" title=\"\">Two years ago, though, I went hunting for a colony of wild beaver up in Angus</a> that were said to be running amok in the wilds and, yes, doing in the old ecosystem. As far as I know, they have been multiplying gaily ever since and our seasons are all still falling in the right order.</p> <p>Of course there will be a concomitant threat to human beings if bears and wolves and tigers are jouking about our great forests and glens. I think, though, that it is too easy to exaggerate this. In the great spaces of the African savanna, grizzled old rangers have always said that so long as you simply let them get on with it and don't poke them with big sticks it should be all right.</p> <p>With the exception of the tigers, these animals were all once native to Scotland before we scared them off. Nor would I listen to the farmers who whinge that their livestock would be affected. This disreputable lot nearly destroyed the food chain some 10 years ago after years of forcing their beasts to eat toxic cocktails of feed eventually caused mad cow disease. And then loads of them became millionaires with a hasty and unscrutinised get-rich-quick compensation scheme.</p> <p>And so what if a few stray hill walkers and Munro climbers got slain by the wolves and the bears? It's not as if we don't have enough of them. It would give your average hill-walking expedition a bit of an edge and soon the adventure tourists would be queuing up to pay big money for a trek in the Highlands, thus giving a much-needed boost to the rural economy. And it might even force them to stop wearing all that garish outdoor frippery and dress more appropriately for the Scottish outdoors.</p> <p>They should all be more circumspect in choosing the colour of their bucolic apparel.</p> <p>Much as I cherish the Cairngorms and love to go walking around the place, well\u2026 you soon get bored with the same old deer and birds and rabbits. There would be nothing like the distant and primeval growl of a big brown bear or the eerily beautiful howling of approaching wolves to put some hairs on your chest.</p> <p>If nothing else, Scots kids everywhere would get out from behind their laptops and start rushing to join the Boy Scouts again. I might even be persuaded to go for my Duke of Edinburgh once more.</p>",
  "<p>Bob Diamond may have represented the showy, swashbuckling side of Barclays, but his successor, Antony Jenkins, is a reminder of its humbler, more boring roots, as a plain old deposit-taking high street bank. Where the US-born Diamond was smooth, unrepentantly proud of Barclays' record and desperate for the bank to hold its own against the likes of Goldman Sachs, Jenkins is quietly spoken, forged his reputation on the retail side \u2013 and quickly dropped Diamond's ambitious targets for boosting return on equity.</p> <p>Jenkins has a tough task restoring the bank's reputation and rebuilding shattered relationships with regulators and politicians, against the background of twin Serious Fraud Office probes over Libor-rigging and payments to Qatari investors in 2008.</p> <p>But he will also have to confront the question of what Barclays is for. Does it still cling to the dreams of Wall Street glory that saw Diamond slurp up the dregs of Lehman Brothers at the height of the crisis? Or does Jenkins's appointment signal an intention to make savings, loans and mortgages the heart of the business?</p> <p>Of course, Barclays is not the only British bank forced to face such a dilemma: Jenkins's appointment marks the final stage in the wholesale clearout of the top echelons of the financial sector that started with Northern Rock's woefully out-of-his-depth boss Adam Applegarth in December 2007.</p> <p>Investment banking, which seemed like a licence to print money, has become less profitable as regulators impose higher capital requirements on riskier activities. All the major banks are slimming down their investment banking operations, and selling off some of the other businesses they plunged into during the boom years \u2013 such as, in Royal Bank of Scotland's case, aircraft leasin.</p> <p>Jenkins has stressed his allegiance to \"universal banking\"; but he might do well to heed the words of Andy Haldane, one of the Bank of England's biggest brains, who argued this weekend that banks might be wise to \"make a virtue of necessity\" and hive off their investment banking arms.</p> <p>Much of the typically erudite speech Haldane delivered at the Jackson Hole meeting of the world's central bankers was aimed at regulators. He urged them to ditch 50 years of received wisdom and keep things simple, instead of imposing ever more complex rules, such as the byzantine Basel framework of capital requirements \u2013 the \"tower of Basel\", as he called it.</p> <p>He compared the task of regulators trying to keep track of financial institutions with a dog trying to catch a frisbee. Research has apparently shown \u2013 Haldane's the kind of person who keeps up with these things \u2013 that a dog (and indeed a person) catches a Frisbee by following a simple rule: \"run at a speed so that the angle of gaze to the Frisbee remains roughly constant\". So regulators would do better to concentrate on a few rules of thumb \u2013 such as \"more leveraged banks are more risky\" \u2013 rather than a battery of mind-boggling models.</p> <p>But Haldane had advice for banks, too: he ended his speech by pointing out that in the 1930s the Glass-Steagall regulation that imposed a clean cut between retail and investment banking in the US was only implemented after some banks including the two largest, responded to their sickly valuations on the equity markets by splitting themselves up. \"Bankers today, many cursed and condemned, could make a virtue of necessity. The market could lead where regulators have feared to tread,\" he said.</p> <p>Barclays' valuation will inevitably be seen as one metric of Jenkins's performance. If, like Haldane, he believes that simple is better, he could split the bank in two, and make Barclays a world leader \u2013 but not in quite the way Diamond had in mind.</p> <h2>Russian retreat is about gas prices, not Greenpeace</h2> <p>Greenpeace might think that it has scored a victory with the Russians scrapping their flagship Shtokman gas project in the Arctic, but the Vladimir Putin-approved decision is motivated by money, not the environment.</p> <p>State-owned Gazprom insists that Shtokman is postponed, not forever binned, and it remains in talks with Shell and other foreign investors about trying to resurrect the project, although over-optimism has been a constant here for decades \u2013 until last week.</p> <p>The axe finally fell just days after Greenpeace had taken its first piece of direct action against Gazprom's Prirazlomnaya platform in a different part of the Arctic, so it is hardly surprising the green group wanted to claim victory. But Shtokman has been in trouble for the last couple of years, ever since the shale gas \"revolution\" got properly under way in North America, sending gas prices there spinning downwards.</p> <p>Gazprom originally expected to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) by ship to a new series of import terminals being constructed in the US, only to find the market turned on its head. America is now looking at using those terminals for export and there is such an energy glut that gas shale drillers are packing their rigs up and looking for new opportunities. At the same time massive new finds have been made in locations such as Mozambique, while the European gas market has also been in retreat for suppliers, not because of cheap prices but because the credit crunch has reduced demand considerably.</p> <p>None of this has been good news for Gazprom. Bringing gas out of the seabed was always going to be technically complex and very expensive. The costs at Shtokman ranged between $15bn and $20bn, depending on who you talked to. Gazprom's foreign partners said Shtokman needed big tax breaks from Moscow to make it work, but even Putin could see that this scheme of \"global significance\" \u2013 as he called it \u2013 did not make sense under those circumstances and refused to help out.</p> <p>The Arctic might hold nearly a quarter of the world's remaining hydrocarbon reserves but the Shtokman retreat, coming after Cairn Energy's drilling failures off Greenland, is a reminder that for the time being at least, the financial, as well as the environmental, costs may be too high.</p> <h2>Aussies exposed as Chinese dragon runs out of puff</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395510460\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346438145360/David-Simonds-Australia-C-010.jpg\" alt=\"David Simonds Australia China 02.09.12\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cartoon by David Simonds</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aside from a reputation for being seriously laid back, it's hard to see much in common between the Australians and the Dutch. But a growing number of economists are pointing out that our friends down under are suffering a classic case of \"Dutch disease\".</p> <p>Australia's economy has built a monster boom by selling natural resources such as iron ore and coking coal to the mighty Chinese. A full quarter of Australia's exports go to China.</p> <p>But just as in the Netherlands after vast gas reserves were discovered in the late 1950s, natural resources can be a curse as well as a blessing. They drive up the value of the currency, hollow out other industries by making their goods uncompetitive on world markets, and create an economy dangerously exposed to swings in the global commodity cycle.</p> <p>For Australia, it's looking increasingly as though the good years are over. A sharp fall in the price of iron ore \u2013 down a whopping 30% since July \u2013 is being widely read as a signal that China's economy is slowing and that its demand for resources is not as insatiable as some analysts had claimed. Even the legendarily cheerful Aussies may struggle to keep their equanimity in the face of a Chinese crash.</p>",
  "<p>Each nugget of data about the health of the American housing market or the mood of its consumers will be eagerly seized upon and carefully spun by Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in the coming weeks, as they fight to prove they should be trusted to run the world's largest economy. The US has shrugged off the after-effects of the sub-prime downturn more effectively than the eurozone, and is certainly in ruder health than the stagnating UK, expanding at an annual rate of 1.7% according to <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm\" title=\"\">the latest numbers</a>.</p> <p>Yet the background music for what promises to be a closely fought presidential campaign is of a country less certain than for many years of its place in the world \u2013 hamstrung by public and private debt; anxious about the disappearance of traditional jobs to low-cost markets overseas; worn down by a prolonged period in which living standards for middle America have moved sideways. If the <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w18315\" title=\"\">latest analysis</a> by the US economist Robert Gordon is correct, America's voters have every reason to be concerned \u2013 not just about whether the economy can weather the slowdown in China and Europe over the next 12 months, but about its growth prospects for decades to come. At the centre of his argument in a provocative new paper, \"Is US Economic Growth Over?\", is the insight that the latest wave of hi-tech innovation sweeping out from the US west coast may be less of a boon than its cheerleaders hope.</p> <p>As Silicon Valley twentysomethings waltz off with mega-billions, it's tempting to conclude that the internet has wrought the most radical transformation of the economy in modern history; and as Apple's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/25/apple-samsung-patent-infringement-trial?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">big-bucks patent case</a> against Samsung made clear, the corporate profits to be made and lost in what used to be called the \"new economy\" are immense.</p> <p>But Gordon warns that the growth dividend from the latest wave of innovations has actually been far smaller than that from what he calls the second industrial revolution, in the 19th century. In fact, he believes that the seemingly relentless expansion of the American economy could be about to run into the sand. Industrial revolution one, from about 1750 to 1830, brought steam and railways, Gordon argues; number two, from 1870 to 1900, gave us flushing toilets, electric light, the internal combustion engine and the telegraph, among a host of other benefits; and number three, from the 1970s onwards, computers.</p> <p>Gordon does not deny that there have been productivity gains from computers \u2013 serried ranks of secretaries in typing pools and filing cabinets full of punch-cards have been rendered obsolete; we can organise our lives with a barrage of text messages in the time it once took to pen a single note.</p> <p>And he acknowledges that productivity growth did improve, to 2.5% a year between 1996 and 2004, from 1.4% in the previous 15&#xa0;years, as the benefits spread through companies and homes \u2013 but he argues that many of these were one-off changes, which cannot now be repeated. Instead of speeding up production lines and freeing workers for less menial tasks than typing or filing, he argues, today's major inventions are focused instead on ever more elaborate consumer gadgets. \"Attention in the past decade has focused not on labour-saving innovation, but rather on a succession of entertainment and communication devices that do the same things as we could do before, but now in smaller and more convenient packages.\"</p> <p>He asks his readers to carry out a thought experiment: would they rather keep 2002 electronic technology, but lose anything invented in the past decade; or keep the full package of post-2002 innovations, including Twitter, their MP3 player and their iPad \u2013 but give up running water and indoor toilets, just two of the key inventions that transformed the world in the late 19th century.</p> <p>In case you're wavering, he makes it clear that: \"You have to haul the water into your dwelling and carry out the waste. Even at 3am on a rainy night, your only toilet option is a wet and perhaps muddy walk to the outhouse.\" Surely, he insists, even the most hardened Twitter addict would choose a flushing loo over their smartphone.</p> <p>Not only has much of the gain from gadgetry already been banked, Gordon claims, but even if the productivity improvements that took place from 1987 to 2007 were maintained, the US economy will be hampered in the coming decades by powerful headwinds. These include the heavy weight of consumer debt accumulated in the runup to 2007, and the reversal of the demographic dividend that came as the postwar baby-boomer generation grew up, joined the workforce, and paid their taxes.</p> <p>Gordon estimates that once all these challenges are taken into account, GDP growth per capita could slow to just 0.2% a year. That's still economic progress, of a sort \u2013 but it does mean, as Gordon argues, that the 21st century, unlike the 20th, will not be an \"American century\"; and today's young Americans must confront a very different future to that of their parents.</p> <p>They will have to think harder about rationing scarce resources, and perhaps take a humbler stance in relation to their foreign rivals \u2013 something we Brits have become increasingly used to since our own dominance of the global economy gave way to US hegemony.</p> <p>Gordon cheekily points out that per capita growth of 0.2% a year is the same rate economists believe Britain achieved on average in the 600 years or so before the first industrial revolution, which are better remembered for feudalism, illiteracy and back-breaking toil than the onward march of economic progress. But as the star-spangled banner flutters behind a thousand presidential stump speeches between now and November, don't expect to hear too much about that.</p>",
  "<p>On Thursday, MPs Frank Field and Nicholas Soames will lead a parliamentary debate, prompted by an e-petition sponsored by the pressure group <a href=\"http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/\" title=\"\">Migration Watch</a>. It expresses deep concern that, despite very strong public opposition to \"mass immigration\", the population of the UK is expected to reach 70 million within 20 years, two-thirds of the increase due to migration. Undoubtedly, Thursday's \"No to 70 million\" debate will be marked by some clarity but also a great deal of confusion, contradiction and the employment of similar sets of statistics robustly interpreted to serve opposing sides of the argument.</p> <p>Immigration is an issue steeped in prejudice, traditionally too easily exploited by groups on both the right and left. At times, the toxic results have had a horrible impact on the lives of those who, over the decades, have otherwise successfully made the UK their home.</p> <p>A discussion is much needed on the many issues that arise from immigration. Its economic and cultural impact; its effect on the rationing of resources such as health and housing; and its impact on population, in particular on the level at which we feel the UK is deemed \"overcrowded\", given its requirement for a youthful influx to provide for an ageing society.</p> <p>However, that discussion is again and again sabotaged because immigration provides politicians with levers that are at times too carelessly pulled, particularly in the pre-party conference season. The result is often highly negative. The events at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/london-metropolitan-universities-educate-police?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">London Metropolitan University</a> over the past few days are a case in point.</p> <p>The university's right to take students from outside the EU has been revoked. In spite of a warning six months ago that its procedures had to be improved \u2013 for instance, on students' attendance, and on policing the requirement to speak adequate English \u2013 the UK Border Agency says a recent inspection showed continuing and systematic failures. Now, almost 3,000 students face deportation if they cannot find fresh support to continue their studies. Nigerian Francis Owobiyi is among them, well advanced in his dissertation for a masters degree in international law. \"I could have gone to the US, to Canada, but I chose London, I regret that now,\" he said on Thursday.</p> <p>Malcolm Gillies, LMU vice-chancellor, does not impress with his assertions that change was underway. However, this cruel detonation of the academic lives of hundreds of legitimate, hard-working students is quite unjustified. Higher education is one of Britain's largest and most rapidly growing sources of international revenue. In 2011-12, foreign students accounted for \u00a32.7bn of universities' \u00a323bn income. Now we have a large \"Not Welcome\" sign nailed to the UK's front door.</p> <p>In July, in a House of Lords debate, the Border Agency was lambasted for its many failings. The peers listed its \"disgraceful\" short-term holding facilities for children at Heathrow and the detention for years of migrants, including torture victims. However, in the case of London Metropolitan, it's not the Border Agency that is primarily to blame. The fault lies with the government.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Office for National Statistics announced that migration had fallen last year by almost 36,000 to 216,000, as the government tightened rules. However, margins of error mean very little change may have happened. This is in spite of the 2010 Conservative manifesto that promised to cut net migration from \"hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands\" by 2015.</p> <p>The challenge is that Britain's doors are legitimately open to 270m working-age citizens from the EU. In 2011, 589,000 people arrived in Britain. At the same time, fewer British were leaving to live abroad. So, the effort to reduce the numbers of workers from outside the EU, migrants claiming a place for family reasons and foreign students has become all the more urgent. But restrictions come at a price.</p> <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research says cutting foreign students by 50,000 annually could cost the economy \u00a32bn-\u00a33bn a year. Combine the loss from a reduction in foreign students with the cap on highly skilled workers, much needed by British business and industry, and, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the amount lost to the economy could reach \u00a34bn a year. However, there are other than purely economic calculations that need to be made.</p> <p>In July, Ed Miliband, the son of a refugee, apologised on behalf of his party for allowing net immigration to reach 3.2m under Labour without sufficiently addressing people's concerns about its impact on housing, schools, jobs and benefit entitlements and the pace of change in some communities. A person does not turn into a bigot for raising such matters, he affirmed. So, as a sense of cultural identity, shared values and a common notion of citizenship must also play a significant part in the equation, how is immigration best controlled and what size of population can Britain carry and prosper?</p> <p>Any reasonable response requires that we understand better the benefits and true costs of immigration and that means more credible research. A lack of trust in the government's effectiveness in controlling immigration and manning its borders also needs addressing. A decision on population growth \u2013 70m, 80m, 100m? \u2013 demands that priorities are agreed. As Oxford University's excellent Migration Observatory argues, a population policy designed to benefit the environment, for example, may be very different from one maximising economic growth.</p> <p>Sweden has opened its doors wide to immigrants but worked with trade unions to ensure that paying a pittance for an hour's labour is severely restrained: fairness is key. Fairness is needed here, too, for instance in the allocation of social housing, but also in helping integration by restoring access to free English courses, ravaged by cuts.</p> <p>At the very least, too, the government needs to exempt non-EU students from the visa cap and desist from ramping up the rhetoric. Immigration is a complex and ultimately visceral issue. Nevertheless, in the aftermath of the Olympics, Sunder Katwala from the think tank British Future reminded us that many of Britain's medal winners were third-generation immigrants.</p> <p>\"Beneath the sound and the fury is a lot of consensus on immigration policy,\" he says. \"We are better at integration than we think.\"</p> <p>We should remember those words when we resume our frequently anxious debate about immigration.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2012. The original referred to the think tank Future Britain rather than British Future. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>It has long been conventional wisdom in Washington political circles that Condoleezza Rice did not desire a future in high political office. After being President George W Bush's national security adviser and then his secretary of state she would simply bask in the afterglow of a career at the heart of global geopolitics.</p> <p>Rice had been so personally loyal to the Bush clan, it was believed that she would leave the stage along with them. She would be happy indulging her twin passions of academia and sports as a faculty member of prestigious Stanford University and, just recently, one of the first women to break into the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/othersports/augusta-national-gains-stature-by-admitting-condoleezza-rice-darla-moore/2012/08/20/3f2f97ca-eb01-11e1-b811-09036bcb182b_story.html\" title=\"\">Augusta National Golf Club</a>.</p> <p>So, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/condoleezza-rice-paul-ryan-republican-convention\" title=\"\">Rice </a>took to the stage at the Republican convention in Tampa, not much in the way of excitement was expected. But when she stepped down 20 or so minutes later, it was into a political world upturned. Not only had the usually calmly spoken, wonkish Rice given an emotional, barn-burning speech of the sort that had thousands of conventioneers cheering in the aisles but it had also hinted in no uncertain terms at the White House.</p> <p>She teed it up like a seasoned campaigner. \"On a personal note,\" she began teasingly after endorsing Mitt Romney to run against President Barack Obama. Then she dipped into her own biography in a way that sounded suspiciously like a stump speech. \"A little girl grows up in Jim Crow Birmingham \u2013 the most segregated big city in America. Her parents can't take her to a movie theatre or a restaurant, but they make her believe that even though she can't have a hamburger at the Woolworths lunch counter, she can be president of the United States,\" Rice said.</p> <p>She has used similar lines before. But, as Rice knows full well, in American politics context is everything and there is no mistaking the context of a national Republican convention. Suddenly, Rice was back at the heart of the action and her ambitions were the hot topic of gossip at Tampa. An intense bout of speculation earlier this year that Romney might pick her as a running mate had been dismissed by most as posturing to show the former Massachusetts governor had a woman on his shortlist.</p> <p>Now it looked like it had been real. If Romney loses in 2012, will we see Rice run in 2016? Or, as she has never run for elected office before, maybe she will start smaller and test out the waters first \u2013 as a California senator, perhaps? \u2013 and then run in 2020. With a few well-picked words and a gift for stirring oratory that many were unaware of, Rice had opened up a stunning new world of possibility: that America's next black president might be a woman and a Republican. That is the thing about the assumptions of conventional wisdom: they can be so easily turned on their head by actual events.</p> <p>Condoleezza Rice, 57, was not exaggerating one jot in the description of the disadvantages of her childhood. Born on 14 November 1954, Rice's childhood was spent in the segregated Deep South where the racial lines were stark and patrolled by the threat of violence. It was something her family knew all about. Rice's father, John Wesley Rice, was a minister but that did not stop him from arming himself with a shotgun, along with other black men in the neighbourhood, when racist whites threatened to attack in the early 1960s (Rice cites the moment as being behind a firm belief in gun rights).</p> <p>In the troubled times of the 1950s and 1960s, few places were worse than Birmingham as America's blacks struggled their way through the civil rights movement. In 1963, a horrific <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAC16.htm\" title=\"\">church bombing</a> in the city (nicknamed grimly \"Bombingham\") shocked the nation as it killed four young black girls, including 11-year-old Denise McNair, one of Rice's childhood friends.</p> <p>\"I know a little bit of what it's like to have somebody try to terrorise a community. These little girls weren't going to hurt anybody. They didn't have any political power,\" she once told an interviewer. \"</p> <p>Yet Rice's childhood was not one defined by trauma. Far from it. Her family, including her high-school teacher mother, Angelena, was a close-knit unit; she was an only child and the focus of her parents' love and ambitions. The Rices also belonged to the small segment of black southern society in Birmingham that formed a solid middle class. Rice's prodigious childhood talents were nurtured. She was a talented pianist (and still plays almost to a professional level). Her unusual name comes from the Italian musical term \"con dolcezza\", meaning \"with sweetness\". She learned foreign languages from a young age, did ballet and figure-skating. In 1967, the family moved to Denver and Rice won a place at the University of Denver in 1971 to study political science.</p> <p>For many Democrats, that story would tick various liberal boxes, just as Barack Obama's biography as a mixed-race child raised by a single white mother from Kansas does. But Rice, as the talented child of a southern preacher who saw first hand the violence of racism, instead eventually drew conservative lessons from life. Her family taught a solid, middle-class work ethic of buckling down, working the system to the best of your ability and trusting America to get it right in the end. Which, in Rice's case at least, it did.</p> <p>Rice worked at her studies, got a masters from Notre Dame, worked briefly in the State Department of President Jimmy Carter and then got a Phd from the University of Denver. She specialised in the Soviet Union, developing hardline conservative foreign policy views, and was eventually hired at Stanford. It was there she first came to the attention of the political clan that would become her second family: the Bushes.</p> <p>Introduced by Bush family adviser Brent Scowcroft, Rice became a family confidante. She served President George HW Bush and then his son, working as George W Bush's foreign policy adviser during the 2000 campaign. After he won, he named her national security adviser and then, in his second term, she became secretary of state. The two were very close, bound by a love of football, prayer and each comfortable with their end of the president-adviser relationship. (She even once mistakenly referred to Bush as \"my husband\".) Of course, it helped that Rice keeps her personal life private. That has fuelled various rumours about her sexuality. She was briefly engaged to a football player in the late 1970s. She explains her solitary ways by simply being so immersed in work.</p> <p>But what one thinks of Rice depends on what one thinks of the Bush years. For many Democrats, and even more people abroad, that means a close association with a failure to spot 9/11 coming, the dreadful horrors of the invasion of Iraq and the neocon ascendancy of the 2000s. So, while Republicans feted and praised Rice after her speech in Tampa, not everyone was pleased to see her. A day before she took to the podium, a group of leftwing protesters tried to enter a Tampa arts centre where Rice was appearing with the intention of \"arresting\" her for war crimes.</p> <p>Yet, if Bush is still not exactly missed by many Republicans , it appears Rice has shed any doubts with the party base left over from her role in his administrations. Partly that may be to do with her race. Republican officials are acutely aware of the lily-white nature of much of their party and when it does try to \"diversify\" that usually means Hispanics. One recent survey showed support for Romney at 0% \u2013 yes, 0% \u2013 among black Americans.</p> <p>In Tampa, two convention-goers were ejected for throwing nuts at a black CNN journalist. Rice offers a high-profile antidote to all of that ugliness. She makes a point of never playing on her race. She is determined that she should be judged on her abilities. She told one interviewer who broached the subject: \"Let me explain to you: I speak French, I play Bach, I'm better in your culture than you are.\"</p> <p>There do not seem to be many obstacles to Rice within the Republican party. When the vice-presidential speculation was circulating, one public opinion poll put Rice as the favourite choice, ahead of eventual pick, <a href=\"http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/29/13557231-ryan-accepts-vp-nod-lets-get-this-done?lite\" title=\"\">Congressman Paul Ryan</a>. It is clear that if Rice wants to enter party politics and run for office then there is a receptive Republican audience waiting for her. It will be up to her to make a decision. If she stays out of the spotlight, her academic career and the lucrative lecture circuit will always await. Her Tampa speech will be remembered as a one-off, full-throated roar of what might have been.</p> <p>But if she takes a risk, if she really does go for it, last week will mark the beginning of something entirely new and unexpected.</p> <p>* This article was amended on 6 September 2012 to make it clear that the experience of watching her father defend their neighbourhood against white supremacists made Condoleezza Rice a firm believer in gun rights. The piece originally said that these experiences made her a believer in gun control.</p>",
  "<p>The first multi-arts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/beckett\" title=\"\">Samuel Beckett</a> festival ended with neither a bang nor a whimper but on a soaring high note from the throat of mezzo-soprano Ruby Philogene. Her French and German song recital (\"perfect lieder phrasing\", in the view of one specialist critic) concluded with a set of spirituals speckled with piquant jazz inflections. Beyond the walls of Castle Coole the sound of the standing ovation joined the swelling echoes of applause that reverberated for five days round the hills of Fermanagh and began with the renowned Irish author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/edna-o-brien\" title=\"\">Edna O'Brien</a>'s remembrances of Beckett as both friend and writer.</p> <p>Five years in the brewing, the festival was set up by <a href=\"http://www.seandoran.co.uk/home.html\" title=\"\">Se\u00e1n Doran,</a> previously artistic director of festivals in Perth, Australia, Wales and Belfast. He rejected Dublin and Paris, the cities most obviously associated with Beckett, in favour of the island town where the playwright/ poet/ novelist spent his late teens as a pupil at Portora Royal School. (Oscar Wilde was a boarder there before him.)</p> <p>Here, Beckett's tastes in music, art and literature developed. Also his sporting talent: he is the only Nobel laureate featured in <em>Wisden</em>, the cricketing bible. A waterlogged pitch prohibited the planned match, but at the rugby club an old-boys team mustered. During what may loosely be described as the warm-up, Beckett's school-team successes were narrated. One spectator wondered, after the manner of some early viewers of Beckett's plays: \"Are they just going to talk or are they going to do something?\" A glass of port later they did.</p> <p>Looking back over a richly diverse programme, two events encapsulate its range and quality. One is Robert Wilson's staging of Beckett's 1958 play, <em>Krapp's Last Tape</em>. The other is a reading of his three last prose pieces, <a href=\"http://mural.uv.es/sagrau/textos/stirring.html\" title=\"\"><em>Stirrings Still</em></a> (1986-89), by Adrian Dunbar and Anna Nygh.</p> <p>Just as Beckett hews words from silence, so American director/performer Wilson sculpts movement against light. Both strip away excrescences, uncover core elements and build of them a pattern striated with repetitions. What is left is so absolute it can seem abstract yet can become, if you allow yourself to feel it and not just think it, the concrete expression of our shared experience of the mystery of consciousness faced with death.</p> <p>Paradoxically, Wilson's technologised production and technically strict performance style \u2013 jagged, non-naturalistic movement and vocal effects \u2013 free Beckett's work from the preconceptions that so often define it. (Speaking of definitions, artist Joseph Kosuth's installation on the definition of nothing was vertiginous in its sly examination and undermining of the possibilities of meaning.) Purists found Wilson's extended, non-verbal opening with thunder and rain effects hard to take. Others, though, seeing the work for the first time, found it deeply moving, as did I. (Interesting to compare this with the film of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/john-hurt\" title=\"\">John Hurt</a>'s intensely naturalistic Krapp; shown as part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/atom-egoyan\" title=\"\">Atom Egoyan</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/feb/07/artsfeatures1\" title=\"\"><em>Steenbeckett</em></a> (2002) installation.)</p> <p><em>Stirrings Still</em> involved a journey both physical and metaphysical: a dawn voyage on Lough Erne to the monastic ruins of Inishmacsaint (\"Island of the Sorrel Plain\"). Here, feet planted in wind-stroked grasses, lichen-stained stones behind them and a cloud-scudded sky above their heads, Dunbar and Nygh read. The clarity and simplicity of their voices made these last writings as real as the chill of the morning breeze. The contrast with Wilson's work could not have been greater. Yet both performances were identical in their integrity of intention and execution; both utterly true to Beckett. Such scrupulous sincerity is the keynote to Doran's programming.</p> <p>More perfect partnerships, this time musical ones. Listeners were transported along Schubert's <em>Winterreise</em> (\"Winter Journey\" \u2013 Beckett's favourite work). Julius Drake's piano was more duettist than accompaniment to tenor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ianbostridge\" title=\"\">Ian Bostridge</a>'s dramatic rendering. Doran wittily scheduled the performance for 18.27, the year the song cycle was composed. Similarly, <a href=\"http://www.gavinbryars.com/splash\" title=\"\">Gavin Bryars</a>'s <em>Sinking of the Titanic</em> went up, so to speak, at 19.12 and was followed by the world premiere of his setting of four Beckett poems for two voices and strings, an instantly classic match.</p> <p>Delivering an impromptu closing speech, prizewinning author, local resident and festival participant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/oct/17/good-to-meet-carlo-gebler\" title=\"\">Carlo G\u00e9bler</a> said this festival was \"embedded in the fabric of the town\u2026 the entire built environment was made to sing\". In the ruins of Portora Castle, where Palestinian writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/raja-shehadeh\" title=\"\">Raja Shehadeh</a> spoke of the conflict in his homeland to the Northern Irish artist Rita Duffy, the harmonies between the place and the experiences of the participants resonated movingly.</p> <p>Beckett's \"basic ethical message\" was identified in a talk by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/20/society\" title=\"\">John Calder</a>, his publisher and friend: \"One thing we can do is help somebody else.\" Here, encounters with Beckett's work brought people into deeper contact with themselves and with one another. Each had something new to offer, whether experts (such as his friend and biographer James Knowlson) or first-time discoverers (such as the tiny tots vocally engaging with Theatre Clastic's riveting puppet version of <em>Act Without Words I,</em> who gave the surrounding adults a vivid lesson in how to respond to this silent piece). Such sharings made this festival a true celebration of the man it honours. May it be the first of many.</p>",
  "<p>The mark of a decent pop biopic is that it should make its subject intriguing even if the viewer has little or no knowledge of (or, indeed, interest in) the music.

While the book was essentially a satire on media spin with nods toward the philosophical aspirations of <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>, Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m's more lightweight and upbeat film (from a script by <em>The</em> <em>Full Monty</em> writer Simon Beaufoy) resets its&#xa0;sights on a pair of star-crossed lovers attempting to dream the impossible dream.</p> <p>Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt are very likable as the mismatched fisheries expert and millionaire's aide who become emotionally entangled while attempting to make salmon run in an environment not known for its enviable fishing conditions.

Having first parlayed the role on stage in the 80s, Close is comfortable in her character's clothes, as is her similarly cross-dressing support, Janet McTeer. The problem is the film itself, which is inert and, frankly, somewhat fusty. No matter how potentially fascinating the lives of its central characters may be, this never exudes much in the way of cinematic brio. The end result is altogether more admirable than enjoyable, a shame because there's an eye-opening film lurking in the background, unable to break through the dour period fug.</p> <p>In cinemas, <em>Piranha 3DD</em> reminded us that screen stereoscopy was, is and always will be a crass gimmick beloved of carnival hucksters and schlocksploitation hacks.

Blu-ray viewers are treated to the reinstated \"3 double-dee\" gag, although anyone who wants to sit squinting at a TV just to see body parts coming out of the screen deserves a headache, frankly.

  "<p>The maverick <a href=\"http://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/famous_psychologist_and_psychologists/psychologist_famous_r_d_lang.htm\" title=\"\">psychiatrist RD Laing</a> once described insanity as \"a perfectly rational response to an insane world\". In 1965, having served as a doctor in the British army and then trained in psychotherapy at the Tavistock Clinic in London, Laing formed the <a href=\"http://www.philadelphia-association.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Philadelphia Association</a> with a group of like-minded colleagues. Their aim was to bring about a revolution in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness.</p> <p>\"We aim to change the way the 'facts' of 'mental health' and 'mental illness' are seen,\" a later report-come-manifesto explained. \"This is more than a new hypothesis inserted into an existing field of research and therapy; it is a proposal to change the model.\"</p> <p>From 1965 until 1970, as radical ideas and hippie ideals blossomed then died in cities across the globe, a former community centre in Powis Road in the East End of London became the unlikely setting for Laing's most radical experiment in what came to be known as anti-psychiatry. \"We have got Kingsley Hall and I have moved into it,\" Laing wrote to his colleague, Joe Berke, when he was granted an initial two-year lease. \"Others will be moving in in the next two or three weeks... I take it you will pass the word around to relevant people. THIS IS IT.\"</p> <p>The \"relevant people\" in question were other psychiatrists who shared Laing's radical vision and their patients, though even the terms \"psychiatrist\" and \"patient\" would be upturned in the next few years at Kingsley Hall. At Laing's insistence, the sprawling house became an asylum in the original Greek sense of the word: a refuge, a safe haven for the psychotic and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/schizophrenia\" title=\"\">schizophrenic</a>, where there were no locks on the doors and no anti-psychotic drugs were administered. People were free to come and go as they pleased and there was a room, painted in eastern symbols, set aside for meditation. There were all-night therapy and role-reversal sessions, marathon Friday night dinners hosted by Laing and visits from mystics, academics and celebrities, including, famously, Sean Connery, a friend and admirer of Laing's. Play was encouraged as was regression through therapy to childhood. (Laing believed that all so-called madness began in the confines of the traditional family structure.)</p> <p>The first, and subsequently most famous, resident inmate, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/jul/13/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Mary Barnes</a>, regressed to infancy for a time, smearing the walls with her faeces, squealing for attention and being fed with a bottle. She later became an renowned artist, poet and, in 1979, the subject of a play by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidedgar\" title=\"\">David Edgar</a>. More controversially, several patients and workers were given high-grade LSD, which was still legal when Kingsley Hall opened, supposedly to release their inner demons or buried childhood traumas. At least two people jumped off the roof of the building. Its reputation, too, attracted drifters and dropouts and, at least once, the house was raided by the drug squad.</p> <p>\"It was a place that was very much of its time\", says the photographer <a href=\"http://www.dominicharris.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Dominic Harris</a>, who has tracked down several former colleagues of Laing's and their patients, all of whom shared the turbulent, exciting and sometimes tragic experiment in communal therapy. \"And it attracted maverick doctors, hippies, people running away from the draft, people trying to find themselves, as well as the seriously mentally ill. It was a time when everything was being challenged and people were allowed to be free in all kinds of ways. Kingsley Hall is seen as a very dangerous idea now by the medical establishment, but, back then, it was part of a greater social upheaval where definitions of authority, family, sexuality and illness were all being questioned.\"</p> <p>Harris first became aware of Kingsley Hall, which is just around the corner from his studio in Bow, when he read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jonronson\" title=\"\">Jon Ronson</a>'s book, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/may/27/psychopath-test-jon-ronson-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry</em></a>, in which Laing, who died in 1989, makes a fleeting appearance. Intrigued, Harris contacted Joe Berke, who put him in touch with a patient. Step by step, he tracked down other Kingsley Hall residents, visited them, photographed them and interviewed them. The result is a self-published photography book, <em>The Residents</em>, which includes Harris's intimate portraits, pictures of the surviving but now disused house, as well as personal testimonies of those who were there.</p> <p>\"A lot of people, particularly Laing's former colleagues, were initially a little bit suspicious of my motives,\" says Harris, \"but the patients were all very forthcoming. They haven't really had a chance to tell their stories before as most of what has been written about the place concentrates on the incredibly charismatic figure of RD Laing. Nobody else has really had a voice. That is what the book is about in a way, letting the overlooked have their say. Laing is the underlying figure in the project, but it's not about him. He's the dead presence, the long shadow.\"</p> <p>Over two years, Harris managed to track down and meet 13 of the reputed 130 people who passed though Kingsley House in the five-year period. Their memories of the place are often impressionistic and contradictory, yet vivid and moving. They are all, to varying degrees, survivors of a radical, some would say irresponsible, moment when everything \u2013 even the definition of insanity and, by extension, sanity \u2013 seemed up for redefinition.</p> <h2>Pamela Lee: resident, 1967-68 <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395648489\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/8/30/1346342124083/Kingsley-Hall-Pamela-Lee-002.jpg\" alt=\"Kingsley Hall: Pamela Lee\" width=\"220\" height=\"278\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was given some LSD.

My sister had left for London. I didn't really have any family at all.</p> <p>I had such a chaotic time in that period in London: so many addresses \u2013 there were 30 places in one year. It wasn't my choice: I just used to get turned out of places. I went to a psychiatric hospital because I had a relationship with this guy I met, a medical student.</p> <p>He invited me back to his parents' and I think I was very, very nervous at the time \u2013 and shy. His parents thought I wasn't very healthy.</p> <p>I remember walking down the street when I was with him, and I felt on top of the world. I was imagining that all the people must be looking at me, thinking how wonderful and happy I was.</p> <p>But then it ended, and it was like the end of my life, it was so awful. I went to the doctor's and I said, \"Can you send me to a convalescent home, I just can't feed myself\", and they sent me to a mental hospital. It was very dictated to you what you could do: I was so disappointed.</p> <p>I had picked up this book years before \u2013 [Laing's] <em>The Divided Self</em> \u2013 and I realised that somebody really understood; it was amazing. So I phoned up and got an interview \u2013 I think it was in Harley Street \u2013 with Ronnie Laing, and he told me about this place [Kingsley Hall].</p> <p>And that's how I got there. It was like someone actually understood. Yes, I was really very impressed with Ronnie.</p> <p>I remember that the people around us [local residents] didn't actually like us very much. There was a very negative feeling towards us \u2013 not a very good community spirit. We were so isolated from the people around us, because if, they saw us, they would just ignore us. They really didn't like us at all.</p> <p>I was given some LSD when I was there. I used to smoke cannabis, but the acid I was a bit nervous about. I don't think I actually took it.</p> <p>I remember we used to eat together.

Afterwards he lived in various other community houses. He now lives in sheltered accommodation in Oxford</strong></p> <p>I was a compulsive overdoser. If you showed me a bottle of pills, I'd swallow them all. Part of the problem was \u2013 and I've been reflecting on it lately \u2013 I was too young. I had too much life to live, and it was going to be so difficult to live it. I saw the road ahead as very long and very difficult, and it was. I mean, now I'm nearly 65, I don't think that way because there isn't so long to go and a lot of the hard work's been done.</p> <p>At the time I was at Kingsley Hall, the view really was that, if you had schizophrenia, it was no good talking to you because you would never get any sense out of a schizophrenic \u2013 it's all nonsense that comes out of their mouths. And I pretty much subscribed to that view. Ronnie [Laing] said, \"Go mad, young man\", and I did. I took him at his word, and I went as mad as I possibly could, and at no time did he try and stop me.</p> <p>There were some very crazy people at Kingsley. There was one man who set up the dining table in the upstairs garden area, arranged it all for a dinner party and dressed up in white robes. I woke up one morning and there was the dinner table all laid in the garden and a man in a white robe gabbling to himself.</p> <p>But I don't think any of them were spotted by neighbours walking on the roof, as I was once. Yeah, [once] I leapt off the roof. I didn't go the full drop. I leapt into a junkyard, which was full of old washing machines and Hoovers and things people had thrown over the wall. I got a crash fracture in my spine that still causes me problems today.</p> <p>Ronnie used to keep acid in his fridge. It was pure stuff, Sandoz laboratory grade, the real McCoy, and he wasn't shy about sharing it around. He believed it was a kind of spiritual laxative, which I think is probably quite an accurate description of it. And I do remember him handing it to me: I thought, 'This is the apple from the tree of knowledge, and if I take this it's going to be a long road back from where I'm going', but I did take it. Ronnie did believe you would be able to flush demons away with it. I wouldn't disagree, I think it's an interesting thing.</p> <p>[Then there was] the DMT \u2013 Dimethyltryptamine or 'triptamine. It's refined from a plant in the Amazon jungle and we had it shipped in from California in a briefcase. I took it once, and it changed my life for ever. Just once really blew my mind, and I never really thought the same about anything again.</p> <p>A group of us at the Hall were interested in taking it. As soon as they injected it, we collapsed on to a bed; we couldn't stand up. We were in a small room. I had a vision of myself as a dead Jew being bulldozed into a mass burial pit at Auschwitz. It was an intensely strong experience. It was the end of life, the end of existence. I felt very dead at that point.</p> <p>[Another time], I remember meeting Sean Connery. He was at the height of his James Bond fame then. He came to a party with Ronnie, and the two of them started Indian wrestling while we stood around and drank. They went on and on wrestling each other in the games room. They decided to see which one was tougher \u2013 James Bond or Ronald Laing.</p> <p>So that was all a wild party, but the next day he turned up at teatime and sat down, had a cup of tea and made it quite clear to us that he had been young once and he hadn't had much himself and he could see himself in us and that kind of thing. He actually came back to thank us for having the party the night before. He was very humble and very nice.</p> <h2>Jutta Laing: resident, 1966-67<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395648491\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/8/30/1346342421406/Kingsley-Hall-Jutta-Laing-002.jpg\" alt=\"Kingsley Hall: Jutta Laing\" width=\"220\" height=\"278\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It wasn\u2019t comfort, Kingsley Hall, that\u2019s for sure.

They had two sons and a daughter, but divorced in 1988. She now lives in north London where she teaches yoga </strong></p> <p>I came here because I wanted to get out of Germany. I had five names of people I might contact and I picked out RD Laing at random and called him. He invited me for lunch, and that's how we met. He had left his wife and his children, and, although some people like to believe I took him away from his family, that's not true at all because he had already had a liaison with someone else before me.</p> <p>I worked freelance \u2013 with Gallery Five cards and doing illustrations for <em>Harper's Bazaar</em> \u2013 and I did very well, but my life in Kingsley Hall and my life with Ronnie became predominant. It was a run-down place to live in, partly because there were quite a few very psychotic people living there who never washed or cleaned their rooms. Some people used it as a commune. A few hippies gravitated towards the place because it was very cheap to live there. Living there we had very little [free] time; we were always a group of people, maybe three, four, five people, looking after someone who had completely lost it, so they wouldn't harm themselves.</p> <p>For everyone who lived there, Kingsley Hall was an intense period, and my life with Ronnie was intense in the sense that a lot of people wanted to meet him. There were always visitors from all over the world. Ronnie was one of those people who you either loved or misunderstood. Some people thought he was crazy himself. Hid did drink a lot but he wasn't a drunk. He was exceptionally alive and very charismatic. [The anthropologist] Francis Huxley labelled him a shaman.</p> <p>It wasn't comfort, Kingsley Hall, that's for sure. But it was an extraordinary group of people. I live a quiet life now and have for quite a long time. I can't say I have found the peace I am looking for.</p> <h2>Dorothee (Dodo): resident, 1966-67 <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395648492\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/8/30/1346342271400/Kingsley-Hall-Dorothee-Do-001.jpg\" alt=\"Kingsley Hall: Dorothee (Dodo)\" width=\"220\" height=\"279\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Ronnie was a magician, a shaman.

Germany was very controlling always and I rebelled and I didn't want to rebel. I just wanted to live and to be myself. And that was an incredible liberation, that it happened, in a way, so dramatically, it was unexpected.</p> <p>This incredible freedom in England and then in Kingsley Hall was just mind-boggling. Germany was so backwards: psychology didn't exist or therapy, I mean that was something for loonies.</p> <p>[At Kingsley Hall] it was open doors and no medication. That was totally revolutionary, that was the whole idea and it was incredible. That was in the Sixties, the big revolution, and for me Ronnie Laing's skill was to hold up the mirror. He was a shaman, he had an incredible gift just to listen, to be in the present, to tune into the other person's world and experience, and I had never met that before.</p> <p>One memory: Mary Barnes had her room and one bathroom upstairs. When she was in the bath, it sounded like a whale, she had so much fun and made these incredible sounds and the bathwater came schlepping down the steps to her room. She had so much fun and screamed and yeah, it was like a whale and the water was coming down.</p> <p>It was always quite a special day when she had her baths.</p> <p>I was a helper: I cooked, I [helped] Jutta. But after a year I started to hear voices. It was hitting me. And then black magic came into the house, this dark energy. It just happened, and it wasn't discussed. It was like a hippopotamus trampling through the house. It was so spooky I can't tell you.</p> <p>Before Ronnie and Jutta broke up \u2013 which was a very, very dramatic time for the whole community \u2013 and Ronnie had his breakdown, when everything fell apart \u2013 Kingsley Hall had already sort of subsided. But there was usually a continuity of meetings, music, getting together, rebirthing and so on.</p> <p>[At one point] I came back from a trip to Germany and there was a meeting going on at the house among various members and it seemed to me like everything had broken loose. I mean, Ronnie was furious and roaring like a lion in pain. When Ronnie left that was when the disaster hit, because Ronnie [was] a magician, a shaman and an incredible being. It was a total downer.&nbsp;Ronnie was holding the place together. Such a place&nbsp;can't exist without such a key figure, it can't.</p> <p>I was introduced to Tibetan Buddhism and [went on to] travel with my Tibetan teacher to Tibet and India. I mean, I couldn't have gone on living in Kingsley Hall. It was 24 hours \u2013 it was non-stop and as I told you I was getting loopy.</p> <h2>James Greene: visitor 1966-68; resident 1968-69<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395648493\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/8/30/1346342515517/James-Greene-001.jpg\" alt=\"James Greene\" width=\"220\" height=\"278\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'He didn't believe in the labels, patient versus helper; there was no demarcation'</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Harris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>James Greene, nephew of the author Graham Greene, was initially a patient of RD Laing.

It was totally unorthodox but he didn't believe in formal training for therapists \u2013 if he thought you were a suitable person to be a therapist, f*** the training. He didn't believe in the labels, patient versus helper; there was no demarcation. The best thing that one could say about him is that he was a kind of shaman. If he'd stuck to being a shaman, OK, but he was also working officially as a psychoanalyst. You can't really combine these two roles and he was full of contradictions. The people involved with him suffered as a result\u2026</p> <p>One patient had been in a mental hospital: John Woods, I think. His label in orthodox psychiatry was paranoid schizophrenic. He had some fantasy about some young woman and he couldn't write letters to her himself so he dictated them to me. When it turned out this woman wasn't interested, he assumed wrongly that I was preventing her from coming to visit him. He thought I was a black magician and was controlling her. Then living in there became quite scary. There was a chapel in the building, with a huge crucifix, and he burst into my room early one morning holding it. I thought he was going to attack me with it but he wanted to exorcise me.

  "<h2>Francine Prose, author of Blue Angel and My New American Life</h2> <p><em>Anna Karenina</em> is probably my favourite novel. More than any other book, it persuades me that there is such a thing as human nature, and that some part of that nature remains fundamentally unaffected by history and culture. I try to re-read it every few years. Each time, perhaps because I'm older and have experienced more, I find things I never noticed before. Not only is it a great source of pleasure, but I inevitably feel as if I'm getting a sort of pep talk from Tolstoy: Go deeper. Try harder. Aim higher. Pay closer attention to the world. It's orchestral, symphonic, full of distinctive melodies, parallels and variations that keep reappearing, some of which we notice, none of which we need to notice in order for them to operate on our subconscious. There are so many virtuosic set pieces (the skating party, the ball, the mushroom-picking expedition, and, my God, the race during which Vronsky breaks his horse's neck) but also small, powerful, resonant moments: I've always loved the scene in which Anna, having met the charming Vronksy, returns home to her husband and is struck by how unattractive his ears are. How could&#xa0;something like that not stand up to, and transcend, the so-called test of time?</p> <h2>William Dalrymple, author of The Last Mughal and Nine Lives</h2> <p>I read <em>Anna Karenina</em> when I was 20. I'd grown up in provincial Scotland, a long way from the centre of things. I immediately identified with the Levin character \u2013 like him, I was more confident with books than I was with parties, and constantly losing the girls I was interested in to slicker, hunkier Vronsky-like characters. Levin's concern in whether to live in the town or the country was something I could completely relate to; I was at university and enjoying all the liveliness and intellectual life that Cambridge had to offer, but I loved going back to remote Scotland. The tension in the novel between the boredom, rootedness and loveliness of the countryside and the excitement but vapidity of urban life was something that spoke to me at that age in a way that might not make much sense to kids who were brought up in a town. Weird little pockets of late-Edwardian Scotland survived into the 1970s \u2013 I even knew a few people who had been brought up by governesses \u2013 so Tolstoy's Russia was not an unfamiliar world to me. Tolstoy has that way of introducing characters who we recognise from our own experience, which is always the mark of a great novelist. I expect if I read the book again now, it would be a very different reading. That said, south Asia, where I live now, also has recognisably Tolstoyan characteristics, and the kind of feudal characters who appear in modern Pakistani literature \u2013 especially the short stories of Daniyal Mueenuddin \u2013 seem to be first cousins of those in Tolstoy.</p> <h2>Jilly Cooper, author of Jump!</h2> <p>Very few men write very well about women, but Tolstoy understood women just as well as men \u2013 that's what makes the book so interesting. Anna is a wonderful character. She comes across as so gorgeous and adorable, and her sex appeal radiates down the centuries. But she can't cope with Vronsky at all. At the end, she keeps trying to attract young men to make Vronsky jealous \u2013 Tolstoy's very good on jealousy. And the characters are just so well-rounded. Vronsky is a cad, but he's quite silly as well, which is endearing. It was written as a serial and that makes it so incredibly readable because of the cliffhangers \u2013 you desperately want to get on and start the next bit. But it was trashed to start off with as a trifling romance of high life. Isn't that awful? I bet they're kicking themselves, those critics. It must have shocked people, though \u2013 there's lots of sex. And Tolstoy obviously knew all the upper classes backwards, because he was a member of them and moved in those circles. He captures the double standards very well. That's the more terrible aspect of the story \u2013 Anna's brother shags the nanny and immediately he's forgiven by the wife and nobody minds at all, and Vronsky goes back into society and everybody goes, \"Whoops, oh well, never mind!\" But then poor old Anna goes to the theatre \u2013 that's the worst scene of all \u2013 and everybody turns their backs on her. It's horrible, horrible.</p> <h2>Mohsin Hamid, author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist</h2> <p>When I finished with college in America, I took a year off to work on my first novel and went back to Pakistan with a suitcase full of books I thought I should read. Among those books was <em>Anna Karenina</em>. Very often, I used to turn to classic works of literature with a certain degree of apprehension that it would bore the pants off me but would be good for me. But that wasn't the case at all with Anna Karenina. I thought the story was romantic, passionate, wonderful. And as somebody who was trying to write, it was an enormously educational book. At first glance it seemed like a very conservative interpretation of what a novel could be, but in fact Tolstoy was making some remarkably avant-garde and exciting moves as a writer \u2013 there is a wonderful chapter or two when you see the goings-on from the point of view of Levin's dog. I remember reading the crazy farming scenes, where Levin is doing repetitive work with the peasants in the field, and thinking, \"What's going on here?\" What struck me was that, through cadence and form and even boredom \u2013 Tolstoy deploys boredom quite strategically in these big books of his \u2013 there was a communication of a partial loss of self that can take place in the act of repetitive physical labour. It was like finding an east Asian Zen koan buried in the heart of a 19th-century Russian aristocrat's opus. Today, an editor would say take that out, but Tolstoy was fortunate in not existing in the current environment. To me, these scenes are signs of an unbridled belief in what a novel can do. There are so many facets of this huge intricate thing that can blow you away if you stop to look at them.</p> <h2>Julie Myerson, author of Then</h2> <p>In 1979 when I was 18, I left Nottingham (having only ever been abroad once) to spend a year as an au pair in Florence. The fat black Penguin edition of <em>Anna Karenina</em> was the only novel I could squeeze into my very small suitcase. My memory of reading it \u2013 late at night, in a breathtakingly ornate Florentine drawing room next to Palazzo Pitti \u2013 is still intense. There was a grand piano, tall, shuttered windows on to a jasmine-scented courtyard \u2013 and I was told the Vasari Corridor was on the other side of our yellow painted wall. The novel, with its vast panorama of heady, complex and tragic adult emotions \u2013 Anna's aching passion, but also the touching arc of Levin and Kitty's love, and even Dolly's chaotic, overburdened domesticity \u2013 seemed to encompass everything that lay ahead of me in life. And that room in Florence \u2013 lonely, romantic and exhilarating all at the same time \u2013 seemed somehow irrevocably tangled up with every word Tolstoy had written.</p>",
  "<p>Armando Iannucci has a confession to make. \"The thing is, I don't despise them,\" he says. \"I've always been fascinated by politics. Read up on political history. Love all the election shows. I am a political geek.\"</p> <p>At the age of 14 or 15, he would take himself off to a public library in Glasgow to read Hansard. I remark that William Hague is the only other person who has ever been heard admitting to the nerdish compulsion to read the parliamentary record as a teenager. \"Yeah,\" he nods, wincing slightly. \"I know.\"</p> <p>We have met for lunch in a break between final edits of the new series of <em>The Thick of It</em>. The hugely acclaimed comedy has achieved the rare feat of being a hit with viewers, channel controllers, critics, juries of TV awards and the targets of its superbly realised satire. It has not only influenced how viewing voters think about government, it is also a reference point for how the practitioners of politics perceive themselves. I tell him that, in the 48 hours before we meet, I have heard a Downing Street official describe a meeting at Number 10 as \"like a scene from<strong> </strong><em>The Thick of It</em><strong>\"</strong>, and a senior aide to Ed Miliband has told me of a conversation in the Labour leader's office \"so surreal it could have been scripted by Armando Iannucci\".</p> <p>He has always taken meticulous care to make the show feel real, so he is bound to be tickled by approving notices from his victims. He recalls meeting James Purnell, who was culture secretary at the time, at a Royal Television Society dinner. They talked about the very first episode when the cast are in the back of a car feverishly trying to concoct a policy on the hoof. Purnell said: \"I've been in the back of that car.\"</p> <p>When<strong> </strong><em>The Thick of It</em><strong> </strong>was last on screen three years ago, Labour was still in power<strong> </strong>and therefore the primary target. The latest \u2013 and, he reveals to me, probably the last \u2013 series begins by training its sights on the coalition. Peter Mannion, the world-weary, technologically inept old-school Tory played by Roger Allam, channelling a substantial helping of Ken Clarke, is now in charge at Dosac, the Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship. He is in uncomfortable tandem with a minister from \"the Inbetweeners\", as the Lib Dems are called. There is a natural comic dynamic from the two of them \"trying to look like a public united front but secretly trying to get the credit for whichever policy\". Dosac's former Labour boss, the hapless Nicola Murray<strong>, </strong>played by Rebecca Front, has become leader of the opposition by a quirk of the block vote mechanism that no one understands. The cast may have shuffled positions, but the animating spirit of the satire remains the same: the cunning plans of the political class come farcically unstuck in ways that reveal them to be clueless, hopeless and powerless.</p> <p>Iannucci makes viewers wait for the return of his mesmerising monster. It is not until episode 2 that we are reintroduced to Peter Capaldi as Malcolm Tucker, the confabulation of all that is most foul about spin doctors. I wonder if his creator ever worries that his most loathsome character is also his most popular. \"Yes, I do worry. I find it very worrying.\" He finds it especially anxiety-inducing when he meets real-life spin doctors because \"they always talk about how much they like Malcolm and<strong> </strong>how they try and emulate Malcolm. And I think, have we got this wrong?\" When the production went to film in Downing Street, some of the inhabitants of Number 10 came out, wanting to have their pictures taken with Capaldi/Tucker. \"Obviously, we all look forward to the Malcolm moments in the same way we look forward to the Darth Vader moments in <em>Star Wars</em> and Satan's speeches in <em>Paradise Lost</em>. But isn't he meant to be a horrible cunt? Isn't that who Malcolm is? So why are all these people saying, 'Do you know the one I want to be? I want to be the horrible cunt.' Doesn't that say something about politics?\"</p> <p>Perhaps it does. Perhaps it also says something important and not very healthy about the impact of what he puts on our screens. I love <em>The Thick of It</em>, but I tell him that I am also gnawed by a worm of anxiety that there are viewers who will take it not as a satire of some of the worst dimensions of politics but a representation of the totality of politics. When the denizens of his version of Westminster can't organise a photo opportunity without collapsing into calamity, never mind execute a policy that might improve someone's life, what is he trying to say about government to voters? He responds that the show \"never set out to have an agenda. It wasn't a manifesto. It was entertainment.\"</p> <p>The principal driver has always been comedic. \"We see these grand looking buildings down Whitehall. So you assume the people within them kind of know what they're doing with power. And part of the comedy is going through those doors and discovering that they don't really. Although it's a big job, it's actually little people.\"</p> <p>The contrast between the outward pomp and the inner reality also drives the comedy of <a href=\"http://skyatlantic.sky.com/shows/veep\" title=\"\"><em>Veep</em></a>, his American show screened in Britain on Sky Atlantic. Taking his satire across the Atlantic entailed some risk, I suggest, because Americans tend to idealise their democracy much more than the British.&#xa0;\"I think you're right. The interesting thing in America is how much they respect the office even though they're contemptuous of the office-holder. A lot of people were asking, do you think America is going to be ready for this? I thought I was going to get, what brings you here, a Brit, telling us about our politics?\"</p> <p>As it turns out, the show is another hit. If there was any hate mail from outraged Americans \"it hasn't got to me \u2013 probably goes to HBO\". It's <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/03/julia-louis-dreyfus-emmy-veep_n_1735534.html\" title=\"\">up for an Emmy</a> and HBO has commissioned a second season. Three researchers were employed in Washington to help with the \"accuracy\", and he worked \"very closely with the cast\" to avoid scripting references or gags that wouldn't work for an American audience. After a while the actors stopped saying: \"We think that's a bit English.\" Instead, they made \"a set of noises\", an idea started by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who plays the title role. \"She would say, 'We think that's a bit haw-haw-haw.\"'</p> <p>The position of vice-president, described by one of its real-life occupants as \"not worth a bucket of warm piss\", has all the trappings of high office and no real power, making it the perfect subject for Iannucci. A running joke has the Veep asking her assistant: \"Did the president call?\" and always receiving a negative answer.</p> <p>How did the lad who got his teenage kicks from Hansard turn into our most gifted TV satirist, with shows bathed in praise on both sides of the Atlantic? I wonder if it's something in his Italian DNA. Italians have more reasons than most to feel betrayed by government. After mulling on it, Iannucci says he can see how his take on politics might have been shaped by his father. Before he emigrated to Britain, Dad was a journalist in Mussolini's Italy, wrote for an anti-fascist newspaper \"and then had to take to the hills and join the partisans, and as soon as the war was over he got out\". He found a new home in Glasgow but he wasn't a British citizen so he couldn't vote. \"I remember saying to him, 'Are you not frustrated you can't vote in the election?' He said, 'Well, the last election I remember, Mussolini got in.' So, you know: what good is your vote? Maybe it was that side.\"</p> <p>Mum was a first-generation immigrant. She was born in Glasgow but to an entirely Italian family. \"So it's all Italian blood.\" Yet his parents \"never brought us up speaking Italian because they thought it's better to feel integrated\". As a result, \"you feel Scottish, but not quite. But neither do you feel completely Italian. You're always slightly standing back from it and kind of observing\".</p> <p>Not sure whether you are inside or out?</p> <p>\"Yeah,\" he responds. \"Just, well, feeling half in and half out.\"</p> <p>Now, though, he is most definitely in with the British establishment. He has been begonged with the Order of the British Empire, an irony I want to spend some time teasing him about. You could easily imagine an episode of <em>The Thick of It</em> crafted around the comedy of pinning this Whitehall bauble on a man who makes his living from ridiculing government. Why accept an OBE? \"I thought it would be funny. That's why,\" he says, a touch defensively. Funny \u2013 how? \"I just think it's hilarious.\" He quickly adds: \"I mean, I'm not intending to use it or anything.\"</p> <p>So the credits of the new series don't say \"Armando Iannucci OBE\"?</p> <p>\"No,\" he recoils. \"I just think it's like\u2026 I mean either you accept awards or you don't. You know, either you put yourself forward for Baftas and whatever or you don't.\"</p> <p>Mmm. You win a Bafta because your peer group wants to salute outstanding work. You get an OBE because an official in the Cabinet Office has put you on a list.</p> <p>\"Someone must have nominated me,\" he protests. Or maybe some civil servants thought they would have the last laugh on the great satirist by dangling a morsel from the establishment's table in front of him to see whether he would gratefully bite. Didn't that occur to him?</p> <p>\"To be honest, I don't care if they think that. I don't care. I just thought it'd be funny and I was looking forward to ringing my mum and telling her.\"</p> <p>She was proud? \"Very pleased, yeah.\"</p> <p>This prompts me to the speculation that he accepted the OBE in part because of the ambivalent feelings about identity we had explored earlier. The honour was a badge of acceptance. He doesn't quarrel with this idea; indeed he eagerly embraces it as a much better explanation than the earlier ones he has offered. \"Yeah,\" he says vigorously. \"My grandfather [on his mother's side] was rounded up during the second world war and put in a camp because he was Italian. So there's that element: have we quite fitted in? Do people see us as British? So I can now say, right, OK, there you are, here's a document that proves it, so don't worry. Other than that, I see it as very nice, happy to get the recognition and then put it to one side and don't mention it again.\"</p> <p>Where would he stop? Is he hoping for a knighthood next?</p> <p>\"I think that would be taking the joke too far.\"</p> <p>A question I am keen to get my teeth into is whether the treatment given to politics on British television has gone beyond a joke. He may say he does not despise politicians, he may insist that his agenda is no more than comedic, but I want to investigate whether he feels any responsibility for the fact that so many of the British do hold politics in a deep contempt, a contempt that is often richly deserved but which can also be indiscriminate, lazy and ultimately poisonous for democracy. Iannucci describes himself as \"a sort of vague, woolly liberal with a small l. Left of centre-ish.\" Yet the moral we are invited to draw from his work is not at all \"left of centre-ish\". <em>The Thick of It</em> tells us that politics is a profession populated only by fools and knaves. The laughs nudge the viewer to the profoundly serious conclusion that all government is crap. Does he ever worry that, whether he means to or not, his message is basically the same as that of the Tea Party and Fox TV?</p> <p>\"Wow,\" he says, taken aback. \"I'm not sure it says government is crap. I think it says the people in government are crap.\"</p> <p>Does that make any difference? Either way, isn't he guiding the audience to the reactionary or nihilistic view that government is pointless? He approaches the question sideways by explaining how his thinking has developed. The first series of <em>The Thick of It</em> \"was very much coming in on the back of Blair and Iraq, and how did that happen?\" It was driven by an idea of Blair as \"someone with a domineering, centralised control over government\" with \"a group of bully boys, the enforcers, who would visit departments and just tell the minister this is what you say, this is your newest line to take, this is your view\". In the second series, \"I started feeling a little bit of sympathy for politicians. We the people put this pressure on them to be absolutely perfect, to not stumble, to have a fully thought-out, fully budgeted opinion on every topic we throw at them. Not to buy anything, not to have a salary, not to go on holiday, none of that. I actually started feeling sorry for them.\"</p> <p>Making this latest series has led him to a more fundamental conclusion. \"This time around I've kind of come at it with a feeling that the whole system just doesn't work. And it's primarily because we have a generation of politicians who have done nothing apart from politics. They do the politics degree, become a researcher, become an adviser, become an MP; they're in the cabinet by the time they're 39.\"</p> <p>True enough. Books have been written about the rise to dominance of a professional political class. Whatever their ideological differences, David Cameron, George Osborne, Ed Miliband, Ed Balls and Nick Clegg have this in common: they have spent all, or nearly all, of their adult lives in politics. Despite their lack of experience of anything else, says Iannucci, warming to this theme, \"the generation we have now running politics has felt all the more the need to interfere in minute detail in the working of every department. So it's not just about the big plans \u2013 like how many hospitals can we afford. It's what kind of books you should be reading, how to do homework. What we have are people with no experience, but trying to micro-manage.\"</p> <p>That is a speech, I remark, which would be welcomed with loud applause by many Tories. Absolutely right, they would cry: let's have much less government, sack most of the civil service, roll back the meddlesome state. He again protests that this is not his agenda. \"There's an alternative view. The machinery of government can work, but what you [the politician] need is not to feel that you are infallible. It's all right to take your time and actually listen to people with more specialist knowledge. Because the other thing that's weird is that someone could be running, say, the health service for 18 months and then overnight is in charge of the military or police or prisons \u2013 do you know what I mean?\"</p> <p>I do. Mind you, I have my doubts that government by \"experts\", also known as vested interests, would always prove to be a great experience for the voters. Is he saying that the army should answer only to generals, education policy should be made only by teachers and how we run jails should be the sole prerogative of prison officers?</p> <p>\"No, no, no, no, no,\" he responds. \"But I think what's happened, as you pointed out, is as they got less and less direct power, we've built up this idea of politicians being these super beings from whom all final decisions flow, and I just feel that something's kind of not right. I don't have the solution to it. It's just an observation that I feel it doesn't work.\"</p> <p>In portraying those who govern us as blundering idiots or amoral schemers, he splices the two strongest traditions of political satire on British television. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FRVvjGL2C0\" title=\"\"><em>Yes Minister</em></a> and its sequel <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> depicted politicians as the gulled puppets of wily civil servants. Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn had a great success with that in the 1980s, despite their show being utterly untrue to reality. Margaret Thatcher, the least Jim Hackerish of politicians, was bending the civil service \u2013 and a whole lot else \u2013 to her will.</p> <p>The politician as machinating villain inspired the antihero of Michael Dobbs's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylu3x72WHTs\" title=\"\"><em>House of Cards,</em></a> in which a satanic Ian Richardson as Francis Urquhart murdered his way to the premiership. Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran created the Thatcherite grotesque, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKFsEt_3zzk\" title=\"\">Alan B'Stard</a> for Rik Mayall.</p> <p>While consistently excelling at satirising Westminster, British television has failed \u2013 in fact, rarely even attempted\u2013 to dramatise politics as it really is. The Americans had a go with <em>The West Wing</em>. Aaron Sorkin's show was too romantic to be entirely realistic \u2013 \"a liberal wet dream\" of an American presidency, as <em>Wall Street Journal </em>columnist Peggy Noonan described it. Its considerable merit was that it attempted to show politicians and their advisers wrestling with sophisticated policy dilemmas and hard moral choices, sometimes getting it wrong and sometimes right.</p> <p>The Danish political drama, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b019ch5q/episodes/guide\" title=\"\"><em>Borgen</em></a>, recently shown on BBC4, is a classy, gripping and highly textured series that gives an authentic sense of the pressures of running a modern government and how the stress can destroy relationships, even between fundamentally decent people.</p> <p>I ask Iannucci why he thinks British television has not been capable of producing something comparable? Part of the problem, he says, is persuading TV executives to commission anything about politics. \"I remember when I was getting <em>The Thick of It</em> under way. It was a time when if you said 'politics' to them, they'd say, 'No, people aren't interested. Boring. Wouldn't get viewers.'\"</p> <p>He was fortunate: \"I think I was quite lucky because BBC4 was just starting and that was seen as being a bit experimental \u2013 so we could try it. If it didn't work, it didn't work. At least we tried it. And it also meant we didn't have much money, so that affected the style of it, the very fast shooting style.\"</p> <p>He thinks it may also have something to do with Americans having developed a different attitude towards television. \"They just take it more seriously. It used to be film was the art form. I think they realise, as TV screens have got bigger, TV is like a movie experience in the home. So now you can actually do more with television, up the game and do more challenging work. We're just beginning in the UK to think we've been caught napping.\"</p> <p>The next challenge for him is whether there is much more satirical juice to be squeezed out of our political lemons. Fiction now struggles to compete with reality when Boris Johnson makes an arse of himself by getting stuck on a zip wire, Jeremy Hunt almost clouts a bystander with an Olympic bell, the budget unravels over taxes on pasties, David Cameron texts \"lol\" to a tabloid executive without knowing it stands for \"laugh out loud\" and Francis Maude recommends that people prepare for a petrol shortage by filling up their jerry cans. I put it to Iannucci that it is time to swivel his guns on to a fresh target, to go after people who really wield great, global, unaccountable power: bankers, say, or the magnates of social media.</p> <p>This suggestion is greeted with a smile: \"I'm thinking that very thought.\"</p> <p>He goes on to explain: \"Probably this will be the last series of <em>The Thick of It</em>. The door is left open at the end to come back and do specials. But I feel I have explored every crevice now and it's time to take stock and move on. I'm thinking about the power of the internet.\"</p> <p>This sounds like an excellent idea. Who, after all, has the more power: a British cabinet minister or the emperors of Google?</p> <p>\"Exactly,\" he nods. \"Microsoft, Google, Facebook: you have these twentysomethings who have a way into billions of households. It's what we were talking about earlier: where's the power gone? The power is gravitating towards these companies.\"</p> <p>He reveals that he has already done a script for HBO for a show set in Silicon Valley.</p> <p>\"I'm also interested in that personal thing of what it does to you when you're 25 and you're a multibillionaire and everyone in the world knows who you are.\"</p> <p>I'm glad to hear this. It is long past time that the over-revered, under-scrutinised, vastly rich and powerful spiders of the web felt the business end of a sharp satirical stick. I can't think of anyone better to wield it than the brilliant geek from Glasgow.</p>",
  "<p>The man in front of me has fear in his eyes. Fear, suspicion, and something else, something more subtle, that I realise after a few seconds is pity. It is the evening rush hour in London and I am standing in the middle of Carnaby Street holding aloft a placard that reads: \"Free Hugs\". My mission is simply to reach out to strangers, clasp them close and make them feel better about their day \u2013 no strings attached. But this man isn't convinced.</p> <p>\"What are you selling?\" he asks.</p> <p>\"Nothing,\" I explain. \"We're just offering hugs to people. For free.\"</p> <p>The man slips his iPhone out of his jacket pocket and takes a photo, as if he cannot quite believe what he is seeing. I open my arms in what I hope is a welcoming, earth-motherly fashion. I remember what I've been told in the pre-hugs briefing by the group co-ordinator: smile, but not so much that you look psychotic, and don't take offence if someone doesn't want to hug you back. I wait. The man looks uneasy, a bit embarrassed and then, unexpectedly, his face breaks into a smile.</p> <p>He hugs me. And although I've been secretly dreading the moment when I'll have to engage in a surprisingly intimate act with a stranger who might have all manner of personal hygiene problems, I discover that it's a nice feeling. We hold each other for a moment, then release. We exchange smiles and I watch as he makes his way back down the street. I like to think there is a certain lightness in his step that wasn't there before, but it's probably just that he's walking more quickly in order to get away from the crazy woman with the \"Free Hugs\" placard.</p> <p>The story of how I got to be here, pressing flesh with random pedestrians, is an intriguing one. It is a story of how, eight years ago, a man from Sydney set out to bring us all a little bit closer and founded the Free Hugs movement. It is a story of how the idea caught hold of people's imaginations across the globe and made him famous. It is a story of how he set out to spread free love but ended up in a battle of bitter recrimination over money. And it is a story, ultimately, about how you can start with the best of intentions and yet end up disillusioned.</p> <p>In June 2004, an Australian who went by the pseudonym Juan Mann started giving out free hugs in his local shopping mall. Mann had reached a point of personal crisis in his own life: his parents had divorced and his fianc\u00e9e had broken off their engagement. He realised that people were living increasingly disconnected lives. The need for human contact had been neglected. In Mann's eyes, we were living in a computer-mediated culture where friends were made through MySpace and families were breaking down. Where previously small-scale local communities had been integral to individual wellbeing, now people were pursuing far-flung separate lives in different corners of the globe.</p> <p>Mann hand-wrote a sign advertising Free Hugs and went to the Pitt Street Mall in central Sydney, where he stood for 15 long, lonely minutes before an elderly lady took pity on him. Her dog had just died, she confessed, and the hug had made her feel better. Soon Juan Mann was handing out hugs every few seconds. As the days passed, more volunteers with their own handwritten signs came and stood alongside him.</p> <p>Shimon Moore was one of them.</p> <p>\"I had a job holding a sign advertising a sale on shoes,\" Moore says, speaking to me from his home in Los Angeles. \"I saw this guy offering free hugs one day. I thought it was a great idea, so I started talking to him.\"</p> <p>Moore wrote songs in his spare time and was the lead singer for a band called Sick Puppies. The band was looking for a record deal, so Moore took his father's video camera to the mall and started to film Juan Mann with the idea of making a music video. Free Hugs had started taking off: every day, hundreds of shoppers would stop to be hugged by the anonymous man with the home-made placard. By October the police had got wind of it and threatened to ban the movement. Ten thousand people signed a petition. The police backed down.</p> <p>Moore filmed it all. When he and his band, Sick Puppies, moved to Los Angeles in March 2005 in search of a record deal, he edited the footage, set it to music and sent it back to Mann in Sydney as a present. Mann posted the video on YouTube and it went viral, attracting 70m views.</p> <p>\"I had a feeling when I was making it that this was good, that it would connect with people \u2013 and that doesn't happen often,\" Moore says now. \"I did it in one night. It was just really flowing.\"</p> <p>The YouTube video made Juan Mann into something of a celebrity and his campaign attracted global media coverage. By 2006 he was being interviewed by Oprah Winfrey and Free Hugs was going international: branches sprang up in Taiwan, Israel, Italy, America, Switzerland, Norway, India, Portugal and the UK. It seemed to touch a nerve.</p> <p>In Philadelphia a sociology professor called Faye Allard set up her own Free Hugs spin-off and explained its appeal. \"The success of the movement reflects the fact that we're all becoming increasingly isolated,\" she said. \"Households no longer contain extended family, people stay single for longer and have children later. This is compounded by the fact that we have become more geographically mobile\u2026 Phones, the internet and email mean that much of our personal contact is reduced to electronic interaction. What the Free Hugs movement does is restore a sense of community in a society of disparate individuals. It gives us a sense that we belong.\"</p> <p>Off the back of the YouTube video, Moore and his band got a record deal. They started selling Free Hugs merchandise at their gigs \u2013 T-shirts and mugs emblazoned with Juan Mann's distinctive handwriting. Mann wrote a book \u2013 <em>The Illustrated Guide to Free Hugs </em>\u2013 became an after-dinner speaker and published his address and mobile-phone number online, offering to go for a meal with anyone who contacted him. For a while, everything was good.</p> <p>But then it all went quiet. When I attempt to get in touch with Juan Mann, he seems to have disappeared. I try sending him messages through his website, his Facebook profile and his Twitter account. I call the number he published online and the line goes dead. I contact his friends, none of whom will tell me his real name. They tell me Juan hasn't been in touch for a long time. There are a few dark murmurings about him \"flipping out\" and going to live in a surfer's community north of Sydney. One of them gives me another phone number and that doesn't work either.</p> <p>Eventually I track down a brief interview Mann gave to a New York-based business news website in 2010 in which he claimed Shimon Moore had screwed him over financially by getting him to sign up with the same management company that represented Sick Puppies.</p> <p>\"I complied, believing that Shimon, as my friend, would make certain that we were both amply compensated for the video and the Free Hugs merchandise the band sells,\" Mann said. But according to Mann, that didn't happen: he claimed all the earnings went straight to Moore and his band members.</p> <p>\"Needless to say,\" Mann continued, \"we aren't friends anymore\u2026 I haven't seen a dollar from the band, nor the manager.\"</p> <p>When I speak to Moore, he is clearly uncomfortable. \"That's a touchy subject,\" he says over the phone. \"I haven't commented before because I don't want to fuck up the brand. The truth is, we had a falling-out over money\u2026 Juan flipped out and got lawyers and stuff. He totally changed when he got famous, and it messed up our friendship. But I don't want people to focus on that because Free Hugs is supposed to be about love, not two guys bickering.\"</p> <p>Moore seems genuinely distressed about the falling-out. He loved Free Hugs.</p> <p>\"It wasn't a Christian thing or a colour thing or a cultural thing in one country,\" he says. \"Everyone likes a hug no matter what, no matter how broken you are.</p> <p>\"It's just a shame because it was Juan's thing: he made it, he started it.\" He sighs. \"But the beautiful thing now is that it's so much bigger than any one person.\"</p> <p>He sounds as if he is trying to persuade himself. And yet it is true that the concept of Free Hugs has been extremely influential. People still stand on busy streets holding placards in much the same way as Juan Mann did all those years ago. Majella Greene, a former social worker, founded the London-based Guerrilla Hugs in January 2010. She is currently studying for an MSc in Positive Psychology and is interested in the positive impact touch can have on human interaction.</p> <p>\"My concern is that as we get older, as children grow up, the amount we experience positive, platonic touching reduces,\" Greene says when we meet in a caf\u00e9 with other volunteers who have given up their time to hug total strangers of a Thursday evening. Greene is an enthusiastic and bubbly speaker, much given to expressive hand gestures. I get the impression that most of the people round the table have been won over by the sheer zeal of her personality. \"In the UK, there's this moral panic about physical contact with other people, either in the workplace or with children because of concerns around sexual harassment or worries that teachers are going to be accused of paedophilia,\" she says. \"You've got a generation of children growing up playing computer games without being able to take part in normal rough and tumble that builds up alliances.\"</p> <p>Greene cites research by the psychologist James W Prescott, who claimed in the 60s and 70s that the lack of affectionate contact between mothers and infants could result in permanent brain abnormalities associated with depression, substance abuse, eating disorders and violence. More recently the evolutionary anthropologist Robin Dunbar found that primates groom each other for longer than they need to in order to cement bonds, make friends and influence fellow primates.</p> <p>\"I think that's true of human beings as well,\" explains Greene. \"If they experience non- sexual physical contact, they're more likely to feel protected and protective of each other.\"</p> <p>Greene says that everyone has their favourite hugging story. \"I hugged an older man a while back whose wife had died 14 years ago and he hadn't been hugged in all that time,\" she recalls, looking distinctly misty-eyed. \"He stood talking for ages about how he'd not been held or touched and how it made him feel better that I had\u2026 When people turn round and say: 'Thank you, I really needed that,' it makes me want to cry.\"</p> <p>There is a sense that such acts of gentleness are having a necessary comeback after decades of aggressive self-interest and self-promotion. Perhaps it is partly allied to the economic crisis, to a new-found respect for the simpler things in life that do not need to be bought with a credit card. For years we worshipped at the altar of conspicuous consumption in an age when fame was accorded for marrying a footballer or appearing on reality television, and when friendships were made and lost at the click of a computer mouse. These days we take more delight in the everyday kindnesses, in the shared experience.</p> <p>That, at least, was the thinking behind the artist Michael Landy's recent project, Acts of Kindness, in which he invited members of the public to submit stories online of kindnesses they had witnessed or been part of while travelling on London Underground.</p> <p>\"People can exist in a bubble on the tube,\" he explains when we meet for a coffee at the National Gallery. \"They're reading their paper or listening to their MP3 player and everyone is cut off from each other, trying not to make eye contact. It's partly what you have to do to survive in a city like this, but I was surprised by the response I got. Often we feel that everybody is out for themselves, but that isn't the case at all.\"</p> <p>Landy received countless stories: of women crying after the break-up of a relationship and being offered a smile or a reassuring squeeze, of someone making an origami bird and dropping it into the lap of a person who looked lonely, of strangers helping with heavy luggage.</p> <p>\"I was interested in that emotional bridge between self and other,\" Landy says. \"Every now and then, someone does something kind, and it's life-enhancing because you're mixing your emotions with complete strangers.\"</p> <p>Back on Carnaby Street, my efforts to mix my emotions with complete strangers are gathering pace. Some people walk past the Guerrilla Huggers with understandable wariness in their eyes. Others \u2013 and it is disproportionately young women in their 20s \u2013 get the idea immediately and hug me without my having to explain. A handful of shop assistants pop out to have a hug in their cigarette break. A Belgian tourist with a camera slung round his neck tells me there should be more of this kind of thing. I get hugged by a nine-year-old boy, a pensioner and a member of the French Olympic boxing team who explains he is very sad after having lost his match. Every single hug makes me smile. I enjoy it far more than I thought I would.</p> <p>As I'm standing there, handing out hugs to people I've never met before and will probably never meet again, it strikes me that there's an obvious irony in the fact that a movement predicated on free gestures of intimacy should have been riven by in-fighting about money between the two men who made it happen. But maybe it doesn't matter. Like most of the best ideas, Free Hugs has gathered its own momentum. After all, it was always meant to be bigger than just Juan Mann.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org/en/architecture/\" title=\"\">Venice Architecture Biennale</a> is the world's grandest celebration and showcase of the design of buildings. Which, as architecture is both an art and a business, means it hovers between being a cultural festival and a trade fair. And, as architects can have a very high opinion of the importance of their work, their exhibits can collectively resemble a set of competing pitches in the trading of rival forms of genius.</p> <p>Successive directors of the biennale \u2013 a new one is appointed each time \u2013 are conscious of this. Part of their job is to set a theme for the whole event, which is essentially an enormous set of exhibitions and debates, and they like to invent ones which stress that architects are not always egomaniacs, but have a responsibility to wider society. \"<a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org/en/architecture/history/7.html?back=true\" title=\"\">Less Aesthetics, More Ethics</a>\" was the official title some years ago. In 2010, it was \"People Meet in Architecture\".</p> <p>This year the British architect Sir <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/david-chipperfield\" title=\"\">David Chipperfield</a> is in charge. It is a sign of his international status, which for years outran recognition at home, and which won him commissions such as the recreation of the <a href=\"http://www.neues-museum.de/\" title=\"\">Neues Museum</a> in Berlin, home of the bust of Nefertiti, out of the bombed ruins of its old building. For years he seemed too intellectual, too serious for Britain. His native country, however, has caught up recently, with a knighthood, a royal gold medal for architecture and regular appearances on the Stirling prize shortlist, including this year with his <a href=\"http://www.hepworthwakefield.org/about/architecture/david-chipperfield/\" title=\"\">Hepworth Gallery in Wakefield</a>.</p> <p>Under Chipperfield's direction there is a strong British presence among the exhibitors, though not to the point where he could be accused of chauvinism. They are there on merit, running from galactic names like <a href=\"http://www.zaha-hadid.com/\" title=\"\">Zaha Hadid</a> and Norman Foster to the young practice <a href=\"http://aberrantarchitecture.com/\" title=\"\">Aberrant</a> and the critic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/justin-mcguirk\" title=\"\">Justin McGuirk</a>. Collectively they form a varied and surprising bunch with a taste for playful-but-serious provocation: the spirit of Danny Boyle passes through, one is tempted to say.</p> <p>Chipperfield's theme is \"Common Ground\", by which he means that architects are not lone visionaries, but work in collaboration \u2013 with each ther, with builders and clients, with future users and the general public. \"Common Ground\" sounds like \"People Meet in Architecture\", in that it stresses the non-egomaniac side of the profession. It could be mushy, one of those titles that means anything to anyone, but there is cohesion to this year's biennale. The event makes sense. It is serious, but also engaging.</p> <p>It is, as always, vast. Part occupies the 16th-century <em>corderie</em> of the arsenal of the Venetian republic, handsome rope-making workshops hundreds of metres long. Here, architects invited by Chipperfield and his team present a series of installations. Part occupies the biennale gardens which, created in <a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org/en/biennale/history/\" title=\"\">1895 for the Biennale of Art</a>, are almost exactly as old as the modern Olympics, and embody the same ideals of international exchange. (The architecture biennale, first held in 1980, is relatively recent.) The gardens form an unusually leafy part of Venice and house individual pavilions of different countries, a somewhat Eurocentric selection which reflects the leading nations of the world a century or so ago.</p> <p>Each country mounts its own display, following the overall theme more or less closely. There is also the <em>padiglione centrale</em> (central pavilion) where, as in the arsenal, the director selects the exhibits. Other shows in various off-site locations, including by countries not blessed with pavilions in the gardens, complete the picture. It is by nature a baggy, sprawling thing, exhausting if attempted in one go, which always invites comparison with the really quite nice city in which it is located. As Venice is a permanent exhibition of architecture, the biennale has to find a way to compete.</p> <p>Highlights include the recreation of a Caracas caf\u00e9, by <a href=\"http://www.u-tt.com/\" title=\"\">Urban-Think Tank</a> and Justin McGuirk, which serves actual Venezuelan food. This is a way of bringing people into an exhibit about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/20/worlds-tallest-squat-caracas-venezuela\" title=\"\">Torre de David</a>, an unfinished banking skyscraper now made into an informal vertical community by squatters, in order to demonstrate how an unplanned piece of city can work as well as one made by architects. The simple device of the cafe means you can experience something of the place, rather than just look at pictures. It also deservedly won the golden lion prize for best exhibit.</p> <p>A different form of common ground is offered by <a href=\"http://folkinabox.net/\" title=\"\">Folk in a Box</a>, a small structure about the size of a confessional, inside which you find yourself \u2013 as an audience of one and in total darkness \u2013 knee to knee with a musician. The woman ahead of me in the queue came out weeping with emotion, and while my heart was a little harder it was still an intense experience. Another version again is the display by the Chilean practice <a href=\"http://www.elementalchile.cl/?lang_pref=en\" title=\"\">Elemental</a>, which describe its attempts to improve the copper-mining town of Calama, a place of exceptional climatic and social brutality. Yet another is the construction site, with its collaboration of many people in a shared purpose, here represented by the reconstruction of a rough-hewn house in India.</p> <p>Common ground is not always a peaceful place, as the Swiss architects <a href=\"http://www.herzogdemeuron.com/index/news/venice-biennale_120827.html\" title=\"\">Herzog and de Meuron </a>demonstrate with their exhibit about their plan to build a concert hall, the Elbphilharmonie, on top of an old warehouse in Hamburg. It is currently stalled in mid-construction. Eschewing usual public relations bromides, Herzog and de Meuron bravely paper the walls with newspaper articles that chronicle the early hopes for the project and the escalating rows and budget overruns. Models of the hoped-for building hang in the space and you are left to draw your own conclusions.</p> <p>Commonness extends to the past. Nicholas Hawksmoor, nearly three centuries dead, features in beautiful photographs by <a href=\"http://www.helenebinet.com/\" title=\"\">H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Binet</a>. The Britons <a href=\"http://www.carusostjohn.com/\" title=\"\">Caruso St John</a> pay tribute to inspirations including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/sir-john-soane-museum\" title=\"\">Sir John Soane</a>. There is an exhibit about Mario Piana, who, by restoring some of Venice's crumbling buildings, played a vital but invisible role in the history of architecture. The Swiss Valerio Olgiati has invited other architects to contribute images that inspired them, which are laid out on a table.</p> <p>The collaborative group <a href=\"http://www.fashionarchitecturetaste.com/about.html\" title=\"\">Fat</a> (Fashion Architecture Taste) shows a large white model of a fragment of Palladio's Villa Rotonda, as part of its \"Museum of Copying\". Copying, Fat argues, was always an essential part of architecture, and the myth of the utterly original genius is therefore suspect. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Capra_%22La_Rotonda%22\" title=\"\">Villa Rotonda</a> is possibly the most copied building in the world. If Fat's model, which is shown together with its mould, has a touch of the Rachel Whitereads, that's probably fine too.</p> <p>All of which \u2013 the relative humility, the willingness to acknowledge others \u2013 makes an obvious comparison with the recent past. Not long ago, the singular and spectacular were celebrated and masterpieces were commissioned from international stars, financed with the ample spare cash sloshing around the world. Often, these works would be used to distract us from more substantial issues, such as exactly where this money was coming from and where it was going.</p> <p>Now, as we all know, some of this money didn't really exist at all and in few places are the architectural consequences more conspicuous than in Spain. There, a succession of monuments, retrospectively preposterous, has been beached by lost funding. There were also some very fine buildings in the boom years, but their architects are now mostly unemployed. An exhibit at the biennale commemorates this, with a series of black, tomb-like objects, containing nice white models of what was once possible in Spain.</p> <p>Now Norman Foster chooses not to stress the sci-fi trophies he designs for Russian oligarchs, but has entered the common ground spirit by inviting thousands of images from architects, critics and others and displaying them in a dizzying, multi-screen environment that flashes Egypt's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/05/tahrir-square-protests-resume\" title=\"\">Tahrir</a> crowds and developing-world shanty towns past your eyes, along with more peaceful public places and notable works by Foster and other architects. The link is not always obvious \u2013 how exactly does this glass atrium connect with that Indian street? It's also like HSBC's advertisements \u2013 we're international <em>and</em> corporate <em>and</em> caring <em>and</em> global \u2013 but it shows an altered mood.</p> <p>It has become a truism, this transition in the world of architecture from selfish icons to something more caring, and one that is not entirely true. There is still plenty of appetite in many places for flashy spectacle and I doubt if architects have collectively become radically nicer or were all unrelievedly selfish before. A complicating exhibit in this respect is one by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/renzo-piano\" title=\"\">Renzo Piano</a>: he shows the Shard from many viewpoints. It's clearly a work of the icon era, but Piano shows it as part of the common ground of London, almost as a piece of folk art, and it's not obvious that he's wrong.</p> <p>But there is an atmosphere of generosity in Chipperfield's biennale that should be appreciated. There's also patience and care, exemplified by the returning popularity of crafted and handmade objects, such as a very large city plan hand drawn by the South African <a href=\"http://www.noerowolff.com/about_us.html\" title=\"\">Jo Noero</a>, or a long scroll in the British pavilion with a detailed image of an imagined Sino-English townscape. The mood is calmer, slower and more spacious than in previous years and the architects involved seem to be quite happy not to be engaged in frenetic rivalry for totems of status.</p> <p>The national pavilions are more of a mixed bag. Some of the better moments are provided by the legacy of the Soviet Union, with an intriguing exhibit in the Russian pavilion of the closed, secret cities dedicated to military, space and nuclear technology. An Estonian space in the arsenal reveals a 3,000-seat concert hall, built when Tallinn hosted the regatta of the 1980 Olympics, which is now abandoned. The British pavilion, the result of a complex interaction between Britain and other countries, is too elaborate for its own good, but it has several gems. These include <a href=\"http://drmm.co.uk/practice/\" title=\"\">de Rijke Marsh Morgan's</a> proposal for floating houses, based on Dutch examples.</p> <p>It remains to be seen how substantial will be the mood of common ground outside the biennale. A cautionary exhibit by Rem Koolhaas's practice <a href=\"http://oma.eu/\" title=\"\">OMA</a> shows \"Architecture By Civil Servants\", from the 1960s and 70s, when it was still common for cities to have large in-house architectural departments. Their works were not always flawless, but they display a public spirit that is now threatened. Prominent among OMA's examples are the Hayward Gallery and Queen Elizabeth Hall, currently due to be submerged by shops. One can at least hope. Chipperfield shows an attractive, thoughtful attitude to doing things that certainly should be more widespread. It also happens to make a more enjoyable and accessible biennale than many. They can be opaque affairs, not to be recommended to non-specialists, but this one is worth the detour.</p>",

  "<p>A number of rightwing British activists have publicly praised mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik \u2013 one describing him as a \"role model\" \u2013 since the Norwegian extremist was sentenced.</p> <p>Members of the English Defence League (EDL) and the National Front have voiced support for the 33-year-old, who was declared sane and convicted by an Oslo court nine days ago after killing 77 people in two attacks last year.</p> <p>Kickboxer Darren Clifft from Walsall tried to garner support for a petition to free Breivik last week. The 23-year-old National Front supporter, who posts as \"Daz MarxistHunter\", left a message on Facebook stating: \"[Breivik] is truly inspirational. He sacrificed his life so Europe might be free again from the clutches of Islam and cultural Marxism, multiculturalism and political correctness. I see him as my role model, what every European man needs to be in order for Europe to survive.\"</p> <p>Another Breivik admirer, Nick Greger \u2013 who, along with EDL founder member Paul Ray, runs Order 777, which claims to bring together Christian resistance movements \u2013 wrote on Facebook that the Norwegian deserved a medal \"for the groundbreaking performance to blow up his Marxist traitor government building\".</p> <p>Breivik detonated a bomb in Oslo on 22 July last year, targeting government headquarters before embarking on a killing spree on the island of Ut\u00f8ya, where young political activists had gathered for a summer camp.</p> <p>Greger, a German former neo-Nazi, lives in Malta as does Ray, who reportedly fled the UK fearing arrest for inciting racial hatred.</p> <p>Several EDL members also appear to offer support for Breivik, including Joel Yossi, a member of the EDL's Jewish division, who revealed that he had been writing to Breivik, who will be detained in Ila prison just outside Oslo for at least 21 years. Yossi wrote: \"I&#xa0;have wrote letters to him in prison and he seems he is in high spirits.\"</p> <p>The EDL leader, Stephen Lennon, has said that although Breivik's killings were \"obviously wrong\", the court has helped to legitimise his motives. Lennon states: \"By saying that he was sane, it gives a certain credibility to what he had been saying. And that is that Islam is a threat to Europe and to the rest of the world.\" The EDL, with whom Breivik said he had links, says it is non-violent and opposed only to Islamic extremism.</p> <p>Hope Not Hate, an anti-extremist group, said the sentiments of a small number of extremists helped to underline concern that the UK was \"not immune\" to a Breivik-style attack. The group's director, Nick Lowles, said the global network of counter-jihadist extremists meant the ideas that inspired Breivik were still being traded. \"Sadly, there are many others at large who share his warped ideology. Seventeen people in the UK with far-right views have been imprisoned in recent years for terrorist-related offences,\" he&#xa0;said.</p> <p>A report earlier this year found that 38% of BNP supporters considered armed conflict to be \"always or sometimes justifiable\". More than 48% believed it was either always or sometimes justifiable to \"prepare yourself for conflict between groups\" in order to defend the \"national way of life\".</p> <p>Hope Not Hate has now set up a monitoring unit to track counter-jihadist activists that they hope will work as an \"early warning system\" to help identify potentially dangerous extremists. Lowles said it was vital that the government, police and security services began to devote the same level of resources as to other extremist threats.</p>",

Hitting out at the \"divisiveness and bitterness\" of his rival's campaign, Romney pledged that he could turn around America's economic fortunes so that it would come \"roaring back\" under his presidency.</p> <p>Not to be outdone, Obama also delivered a fired-up speech while on the road in Iowa. To chants of \"four more years, four more years\", the president called on voters to help him take the country forward.</p> <p>\"We have come too far to turn back now, that is why I'm asking for a second term,\" he said.</p> <p>The president contrasted his agenda with that of the Republicans, a blueprint for America that was \"better suited for the last century\".</p> <p>The Republican convention didn't offer \"a single new idea\", Obama said, added: \"It was a rerun. We'd seen it all before, you might as well have watched it on a black-and-white TV\".</p> <p>The Iowa set-piece event kicked off a four-day tour of swing states as Obama makes his way to Charlotte, North Carolina, for the Democratic National Convention next week.</p> <p>Saturday's campaigning serves as a potential political barometer as to where the momentum lies in the race at present.</p> <p>And despite a convention that was blown off course \u2013 initially by tropical storm Isaac and then by a somewhat bizarre star turn by actor/director Clint Eastwood \u2013 Romney appeared to campaign with a little more swagger on Saturday.</p> <p>His rhetoric was delivered with greater passion than is usual for a candidate that many have accused of being too wooden. At one point, he even appeared to tear up a little, as an enthusiastic crowd in Cincinnati broke into a chant of \"Mitt, Mitt, Mitt\".</p> <p>He was aided by a decision to give the candidate's wife Ann a greater prominence. Mrs Romney was one of the stars of the Republican convention in Tampa, managing to humanise her husband in a much-praised address to the party faithful.</p> <p>Encouraged by her reception, Republican strategists have seemingly decided to give the candidate's spouse a more central role.</p> <p>Introducing her husband, Ann Romney noted that many families in America were suffering as a result of a sluggish economy.</p> <p>\"Help is on the way,\" she told the cheering crowd, handing over to husband Mitt.</p> <p>For his part, Romney gave a recap of his convention address, using many of the same key phrases and throwing around the same accusations of fiscal mismanagement at the White House incumbent, while also mocking Obama's aspirations to combat global warming</p> <p>He also laid out a campaign platform that includes making North America energy independent, lowering taxes and reducing the national debt.</p> <p>Romney also sought to present himself as the \"unity\" candidate, lashing out as what he perceived to be the \"divisiveness and bitterness\" of the Obama campaign.</p> <p>\"I will bring us together,\" he told supporters, adding that under his watch \"America is going to come roaring back\".</p> <p>The country is overdue a \"winning season\", Romney added.</p> <p>Obama's criss-crossing of the country is aimed at countering the Republican candidate's message, and putting a halt to any post convention Romney bump.</p> <p>After Iowa, Obama will campaign in Colorado and Ohio in a busy weekend schedule.</p> <p>The focus on key states comes amid polling that suggest a tight White House race, which could be decided by where independent voters decide to put their cross come election day.</p> <p>Obama will get the chance to appeal to a national audience on Thursday when he will deliver his keynote convention address.</p> <p>That speech is expected to hang on pledges to end tax cuts for the rich, while putting more effort into education, energy and debt reduction.</p> <p>It has been reported that he will dismiss Romney as a peddler of failed trickle-down ideas that will hurt struggling families.</p> <p>Obama campaign aide Stephanie Cutter said the convention would rely less on rallying the base or levelling \"petty attacks\" on his rival, but would rather focus on \"what we need to do with the country to move us forward, not back\".</p> <p>\"We don't need to reintroduce the president or reinvent him, as in the case with Mitt Romney,\" she said. \"Instead, our convention will tell the story of the last four years, how the president made some tough choices to help a country and the economy recover.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hopes that a Christian girl in Pakistan accused of blasphemy would be released on bail have been dashed, as the case, which has attracted worldwide condemnation, became bogged down in legal wrangling.</p> <p>A judge at an Islamabad court deferred the bail hearing of Rimsha Masih until Monday after it emerged that two separate sets of lawyers were attempting to defend her against charges of burning sacred Islamic texts \u2013 a crime in Pakistan that can be punished by death.</p> <p>The dispute allowed lawyers from the other side to challenge the authenticity of the bail application.</p> <p>In court for the short hearing was Rimsha's accuser, Malik Amad, who claims to have spotted her last month walking near her house in a slum area on the outskirts of Islamabad carrying ashes, which it is claimed included burned pages with verses from the Qu'ran.</p> <p>The desecration of the holy book is regarded as a particularly grave form of blasphemy and can easily spark violent public reactions in Pakistan.</p> <p>Also present was a local mullah, Hafiz Mohammed Khalid Chishti, who has called for the law to be followed to its conclusion, even if that means the girl is executed. As with other members of the Muslim community in the area, he has rejected claims that Rimsha has Down's syndrome or is mentally impaired.</p> <p>Central to the case is the age of Rimsha and whether her case should be heard by the more lenient juvenile justice system. In their bail application, the defence lawyers argue she is 13. A medical report prepared earlier in the week said she was 14 with a lower mental age, although the court has not yet decided to accept the report.</p> <p>Chishti has also been at the forefront of a dispute between the two communities, complaining that Christians in the area were holding noisy services in their churches. He welcomed the departure of nearly all the Christians from the Islamabad neighbourhood in the tense days after Rimsha's arrest, but about half of the families have now returned to the area.</p> <p>\"They have returned, but they are still living in fear,\" said Shamaun Alfred Gill, spokesman for the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance.</p> <p>With the plight of Rimsha attracting international condemnation the case has brought more attention to the treatment of Pakistan's minorities.</p> <p>Murderous attacks against members of the Shia sect are on the rise, particularly in the restive province of Baluchistan. On Saturday the death toll increased again, with seven people gunned down in two separate incidents near Quetta, the provincial capital.</p> <p>Complaints by Hindus have also been mounting in recent months, with families claiming their daughters have been forcibly kidnapped, converted to Islam and then married to their abductors. Parties of Hindu pilgrims were recently detained at the border with India after the government feared they intended to claim asylum and never return.</p> <p>Christians, as well as Muslims, have long suffered at the hands of the country's blasphemy laws. For years rights campaigners have demonstrated how the laws, which ultimately stem from British colonial rule, have been used by individuals to settle scores and economic disputes, often on the basis of flimsy evidence.</p> <p>Despite several ludicrous cases, including the jailing of people for allegedly touching a Qu'ran with dirty hands, public figures are loath to try to reform the system. Two politicians have been assassinated by religious hardliners for criticising the laws.</p> <p>Unusually, Rimsha has attracted support from some heavyweight Islamic clerics, many of them regarded as hardliners. A statement published earlier in the week by Rimsha's father, Misrek Masih, credited the support by the clerics to the amount of international attention the case was getting, which had also forced the attention of the president, Asif Ali Zardari.</p> <p>In an online petition, Masih urged supporters to \"keep up the global outcry on my daughter's case\". The uproar, however, has bemused Rao Abdur Raheem a lawyer for the prosecution, who said Muslims could \"take the law into their own hands\" if Rimsha was not convicted.</p> <p>On Saturday he blamed foreign powers for whipping up support. \"I don't understand the interest of the international community because there are so many innocent people in Pakistan being murdered,\" he said. \"A single drone attack and hundreds of people die. What is the difference between Rimsha and these innocent people?\"</p> <p>Another member of the prosecution team said that even if Rimsha was acquitted she would never be able to return with her family to her home. \"She would not stay in Pakistan,\" said Mohammad Izzat Khan. \"She would be in America within a week.\"</p>",
  "<p>This week, a study <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/27/cannabis-damaging-under-18s-study\" title=\"\">purportedly showed</a> an association, or correlation, between people who became habitual cannabis users when they were 13 and people whose IQ dwindled between the ages of 13 and 38. It also suggested the lack of such correlation for those who first became habitual cannabis users when they were aged 18 or over. Accordingly, one is expected to infer that using cannabis in early adolescence has a detrimental effect on IQ, but doesn't if one begins using it in late adolescence.</p> <p>These findings are likely to be mistakenly adopted by those who advocate continuing the prohibition of cannabis as a justification of their position. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2012/aug/29/cannabis-reduces-iq?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">But assuming that such correlations are true</a>, it is obviously important that cannabis use takes place within a framework where age limits may be imposed. I have been a dedicated supporter of the relegalising of cannabis since the mid-1960s. Neither I, nor any of the various pro-legalisation organisations with which I have been associated, have ever advocated that legalisation should not be accompanied by age limits and other controls. Age limits for a large number of activities are well entrenched and accepted by society, and tend to lie between the ages of 16 to 18.</p> <p>But there are no age limits in a black market. Neither is there any other form of control. Prohibition is not control, and should not be equated as such. It is the abrogation of control leading to the unregulated peddling of adulterated substances outside the reach of the law. Apart from not beginning to achieve its aims, prohibition makes drugs artificially expensive and spawns an avalanche of acquisitive criminal behaviour.</p> <p>Most drugs, for example cannabis, are either plants or are derived from plants, and most plants are very cheap. But as illegal drugs have to be sold on the black market, those who trade in them risk being sent to prison or fined. They charge a lot of money for their trouble. Some people cannot afford to buy the artificially expensive drugs they want to take and resort to theft. The illegal drug business has become so profitable that people have violent fights over territory in which to sell drugs. They can afford to buy guns. Guns are bad. Once a country is full of people with guns, the guns will never go away. Across the Middle East, South-east Asia, Africa and Latin America, civil war after civil war has been funded by the only strategy available to revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries alike, the mass production of their traditional drugs for sale to the absurdly lucrative global market.</p> <p>Prohibition increases any harm that might be caused by recreational drug use. A recreational drug, by virtue of its inherent chemical nature, cannot cause crime; it can only do so through interaction in a social context, which is prohibition and the consequent black market. Prohibition is a root cause of crime, violence and ill health. It would be difficult to construct, even if one deliberately contrived to do so, a policy more physically dangerous, more individually criminalising, or more socially destructive. Prohibition is a relatively recent social experiment, an extremely dangerous failure, and should be dismantled as soon as possible.</p> <p>Legalisation does not require a set of laws enforceable by only the most totalitarian of police states. It is humane and helpful and no more condones drug misuse than a doctor prescribing a contraceptive condones promiscuity. As such, I welcome the findings of the study as demonstrating the increasingly urgent need to legalise cannabis.</p>",
  "<h2>Arsenal </h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>Arsenal got their retaliation in first. Fearful that they would lose Robin van Persie, they signed Lukas Podolski and Olivier Giroud, which ensured there would be no repeat of last summer's last-gasp scramble. They chose to sell Alex Song, believing that they had sufficient depth to cope. Santi Cazorla already looks great to watch.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Lukas Podolski, K\u00f6ln, \u00a310.9m; Olivier Giroud, Montpellier, \u00a313m; Santi Cazorla, Malaga, \u00a312m;</p> <p><strong>\u25c0 </strong>Robin van Persie, Manchester Utd, \u00a323m; Alex Song, Barcelona, \u00a315m; Carlos Vela, Real Sociedad, undisc; Nicklas Bendtner, Juventus, loan; Yossi Benayoun, Chelsea, end of loan spell; Joel Campbell, Real Betis, loan; Manuel Almunia, released; Kyle Bartley, Swansea, undisc; Henri Lansbury, Nottm Forest, \u00a31m; Ryo Miyaichi, Wigan, loan</p> <h2>Aston Villa</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>Having pushed through the \u00a37m deal for the Genk striker Christian Benteke and the Crewe midfielder Ashley Westwood last night the answer is probably yes. Did the fans get what they want? Probably not. While unearthing young and hungry talent from the lower leagues is a nice idea, the strategy also represents a huge gamble.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Christian Benteke, Genk, \u00a37m Matthew Lowton, Sheffield Utd, \u00a33m; Ron Vlaar, Feyenoord, undisc; Ashley Westwood Crewe, undisc Karim El Ahmadi, Feyenoord, undisc; Brett Holman, AZ Alkmaar, free; Joe Bennett, Middlesbrough, undisc; Jordan Bowery, Chesterfield, undisc;</p> <p><strong>\u25c0 </strong>Carlos Cu\u00e9llar Sunderland, free James Collins West Ham United, undisc Emile Heskey released</p> <h2>Chelsea </h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>Yes. The aim was to refresh and revitalise an ageing squad and team, and the players bought have been the right age and have injected creativity to the set-up. Eden Hazard is already illuminating the division, albeit at a cost of \u00a332m. The process of regeneration will continue, but this summer was a statement of intent.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Eden Hazard, Lille, \u00a332m; C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, Marseille, \u00a37m; Oscar, Internacional, \u00a320m; Victor Moses, Wigan \u00a39m; Marko Marin, Werder Bremen \u00a37m; Thorgan Hazard, Lens, \u00a31m;</p> <p><strong>\u25c0 </strong>Didier Drogba, Shanghai Shenhua, free; Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa, QPR free; Rhys Taylor, Southend free; Salomon Kalou, Lille, free; Romelu Lukaku, WBA, loan; Sam Hutchinson, Nottm Forest, loan; Thibaut Courtois, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, loan; Matej Delac, Guimar\u00e3es, loan; Sam Walker, Bristol Rovers, loan</p> <h2>Everton</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>For the second transfer window in succession, Everton moved swiftly and productively to improve David Moyes' squad. The Everton manager still has concerns over numbers, but not the quality. The club suffered no traumatic losses and improved its attacking options with money raised from the sale of Jack Rodwell.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Steven Naismith, Rangers, free; Steven Pienaar, Tottenham, \u00a34,5m; Kevin Mirallas, Olympiakos, \u00a35.3m; Bryan Oviedo, Copenhagen, \u00a32.5m;</p> <p><strong>\u25c0 </strong>Jack Rodwell, Manchester City, \u00a312m; Tim Cahill, New York Red Bulls, \u00a31m; Joseph Yobo, Fenerbahce, \u00a32m; James McFadden, released; Marcus Hahnemann, released; Royston Drenthe, Real Madrid, end of loan period; Denis Stracqualursi, Tigre, end of loan spell</p> <h2>Fulham</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>A summer that saw Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Clint Dempsey sold to Spurs can hardly feel satisfactory, though Martin Jol and the Fulham hierarchy have been creative with their replacements. A frantic final day left the squad feeling slightly sounder, and Dimitar Berbatov could prove a fine purchase at a low price if he can rediscover form of old.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Dimitar Berbatov, Manchester Utd, \u00a34m;<strong> </strong>Mladen Petric, Hamburg, free; Hugo Rodallega, Wigan, free; Sascha Riether, Cologne, loan; Kieran Richardson, Sunderland, \u00a32m; Ashkan Dejagah, Wolfsburg, undisc;</p> <p><strong>\u25c0 </strong>Danny Murphy, Blackburn, free; Orlando S\u00e1, Limassol, free; Bjorn Helge Risse, Lillestrom, free; Dickson Etuhu, Blackburn, undisc; Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Tottenham, \u00a315m; Andy Johnson, QPR, free;, Clint Dempsey, Tottenham, \u00a36m</p> <h2>Liverpool</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>From the owners' point of view, yes, with the wage bill reduced and several unwanted high-earners shifted on. From Brendan Rodgers' stand-point, no. The Liverpool manager has acquired talent that suits his style in Joe Allen and Nuri Sahin, and is delighted to have moved on Andy Carroll and Charlie Adam, but somehow missed out on Clint Dempsey.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Fabio Borini, Roma, \u00a310.5m; Joe Allen, Swansea City, \u00a315m; Oussama Assaidi, Heerenveen, undisc; Nuri Sahin, Real Madrid, loan; Samed Yesil, Bayer Leverkusen, \u00a31m; <strong>\u25c0 </strong>Charlie Adam, Stoke, \u00a34m; Dirk Kuyt, Fenerbahce, \u00a31m; Craig Bellamy, Cardiff, free; Alberto Aquilani, Fiorentina, undisc; Maxi Rodr\u00edguez, Newell's Old Boys, free; Andy Carroll, West Ham, loan; Jay Spearing, Bolton, loan; F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio, released, , David Amoo Preston, free; Toni Silva, Barnsley, free;</p> <h2>Manchester City</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>Possibly, and Javi Garc\u00eda's late arrival certainly cheered up Roberto Mancini who had seen Robin van Persie go to Manchester United and spent the summer moaning about Brian Marwood, who controls the City transfer budget. The decision to replace Adam Johnson with Scott Sinclair was a little puzzling but Garc\u00eda could prove a key addition.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Javi Garc\u00eda, Benfica, \u00a315.8m; Jack Rodwell, Everton, \u00a315m; Scott Sinclair, Swansea City, \u00a36.2m; Maicon, Internazionale, \u00a34m; Richard Wright, free</p> <p><strong>\u25c0 </strong>Adam Johnson, Sunderland, \u00a310m; Emmanuel Adebayor, Tottenham \u00a35m; Nigel de Jong, Milan, undisc; Greg Cunningham, Bristol City, undisc; Ahmed Benali, Brescia, free; Andrea Mancini, Valladolid, undisc; Owen Hargreaves, released Roque Santa Cruz, Malaga, loan;</p> <h2>Manchester United</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>Yes. Sir Alex Ferguson's headline coup for the club and their supporters was undoubtedly Robin van Persie's signature, but Shinji Kagawa's, the \u00a312m arrival from Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund may prove just as exciting following a more than encouraging start to Japan international's career at Old Trafford.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Robin van Persie, Arsenal, \u00a323m; Shinji Kagawa, Borussia Dortmund, \u00a312m; Nick Powell, Crewe, \u00a34m; Alexander Buttner, Vitesse Arnhem, \u00a34m</p> <p><strong>\u25c0 </strong>Dimitar Berbatov, Fulham, \u00a34m; Park Ji-sung, QPR, \u00a32m; Tomasz Kuszczak, Brighton, free; Paul Pogba, Juventus, undisc; Oliver Norwood, Huddersfield, free; Liam Jacobs, Oldham, undisc;</p> <h2>Newcastle United</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>Sort of but not exactly. Significantly, Alan Pardew kept his best players but failed to secure long-term targets Matthieu Debuchy, Douglas and Andy Carroll. Vurnon Anita is the sole first team signing. With Ryan Taylor injured they lack cover at full back and, further forward, will be praying Papiss Ciss\u00e9 and Demba Ba stay fit.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Vurnon Anita, Ajax, \u00a36.7m; Curtis Good, Melbourne Heart, \u00a3400,000; Gael Bigirimana, Coventry, undisc; Romain Amalfitano Reima, free;</p> <p><strong>\u25c0 </strong>Leon Best, Blackburn Rovers, \u00a33m; Fraser Foster, Celtic, \u00a33m; Danny Guthrie, Reading, free; Alan Smith, MK Dons, free; Tamas Kadar, Roda JC, free;</p> <h2>Norwich City</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>Norwich would have been hoping to bolster their strike force, but have not been able to do so, although keeping Grant Holt at the club could prove as important as a new signing.

The arrival of Esteban Granero and J\u00falio C\u00e9sar are particularly intriguing, even if Rob Green must be crestfallen to have been usurped as No1 already. This squad has huge depth, even if the team feels flung together.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Rob Green, West Ham, free; Samba Diakit\u00e9, Nancy, undisc; Park Ji-sung, Man Utd, \u00a32m; Junior Hoilett, Blackburn, tribunal; J\u00falio C\u00e9sar, Internazionale, free; Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa, Chelsea, free; Andy Johnson, Fulham, free; Ryan Nelsen, Blackburn, free; Esteben Granero, Real Madrid, undisc; St\u00e9phane Mbia, Marseille, undisc; F\u00e1bio da Silva, Man Utd, loan; <strong>\u25c0 </strong>Paddy Kenny, Leeds Utd, \u00a3400,000; Fitz Hall, Watford, free; Rowan Vine, St Johnstone, free; Joey Barton, Marseille, loan; Jay Bothroyd, Sheffield Wednesday, loan;</p> <h2>Reading</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>Pretty much and they also did their business early, enabling Brian McDermott, the Reading manager, to integrate the new signings during pre-season. Russian striker Pavel Pogrebnyak is the most eye-catching while Garath McCleary has the potential to be one of the best free transfers of this window.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Chris Gunter, Nottm Forest, \u00a32.5m; Adrian Mariappa, Watford, undisc; Pierce Sweeney, Bray Wanderers, undisc; Pavel Pogrebnyak, Fulham, free; Danny Guthrie, Newcastle, free; Garath McCleary, Nottingham Forest, free; Nicky Shorey, WBA, free; Stuart Taylor, Manchester City, free;</p> <p><strong>\u25c0 </strong>Micail Antonio, Sheffield Wed, undisc; Tomasz Cywka, Barnsley, free; Brian Howard, Portsmouth, free; Andy Griffin, released; Joseph Mills, Burnley, loan;</p> <h2>Southampton</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>Southampton broke their transfer record over the course of the summer, which points to proper ambition to retain their place back in the Premier League. The young Uruguayan playmaker Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez is an eye-catching addition and Nathaniel Clyne appears a steal, though there may have to be more spending in January if they are to survive.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez, Bologna, \u00a312m; Steve Davis, Rangers, free; Nathaniel Clyne, Crystal Palace, \u00a32m; Paulo Gazzaniga, Gillingham, undisc; Emmanuel Mayuka, Young Boys, undisc; Jay Rodriguez, Burnley, \u00a36m; Maya Yoshida, VVV Venlo, undisc;</p> <p><strong>\u25c0 </strong>Ryan Doble, Shrewsbury, free; Dan Harding, Nottm Forest, undisc; Tommy Forecast, Gillingham, loan; Aaron Martin, Crystal Palace, loan; Jonathan Forte, Crawley, loan; Billy Sharp, Nottm Forest, loan; Radhi Jaidi, released</p> <h2>Stoke City</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>In Tony Pulis's eyes, probably not. The Stoke manager used his programme notes last Sunday to stress the importance of strengthening but after years of heavy investment the club has spent carefully. Charlie Adam will add some much needed imagination to midfield while Kightly, if he stays fit, promises to be a decent addition.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Michael Kightly, Wolves, \u00a33m; Geoff Cameron, Houston Dynamo, undisc; Jamie Ness, Rangers, free; Charlie Adam, Liverpool, \u00a34m; Steven Nzonzi, Blackburn, undisc;</p> <p><strong>\u25c0 </strong>Danny Collins, Nottm Forest, undisc; Jonathan Woodgate, Middlesbrough, free; Andrew Davies, Bradford free; Salif Diao, released; Ricardo Fuller, free; Louis Moult, Northampton Town, free; Tom Soares released</p> <h2>Sunderland</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>Martin O'Neill wanted to add goals and trickery to his team and did so in the shape of Steven Fletcher and Adam Johnson, while also pruning an overblown, poorly balanced, squad. Importantly, the Sunderland manager also persauded the much coveted Stephane Sess\u00e8gnon to agree a contract extension.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Adam Johnson, Manchester City, \u00a310m; Steven Fletcher, Wolves, \u00a312m; Louis Saha, Tottenham, free; Carlos Cu\u00e9llar, Aston Villa, free; Danny Rose, Tottenham, loan;</p> <p><strong>\u25c0 </strong>Kieran Richardson, Sunderland, \u00a32m;<strong> </strong>Marcos Angeleri, Estudiantes, undisc; Asamoah Gyan, Al-Anin, \u00a36m; Michael Turner, Norwich, undisc; George McCartney, West Ham, undisc; Craig Gordon, released; Ahmed El-Mohamady, Hull City, loan</p> <h2>Swansea City</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>Paying \u00a32m for Michu, the highest scoring midfielder in La Liga last season, could be the best signing of the summer and there is understandable excitement about the arrival of Ki Sung Yeung and the club-record deal that brought Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez to south Wales on deadline day.

A whirlwind summer market has done little to support his claim, however, as big names were signed, plenty of others were chased and what could make up a decent starting XI were sold.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Gylfi Sigurdsson, Hoffenheim, \u00a38m; Jan Vertonghen, Ajax, \u00a310m; Emmanuel Adebayor, Manchester City, \u00a35m; Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Fulham, \u00a315m; Clint Dempsey, Fulham, \u00a36m; Hugo Lloris, Lyon, \u00a37.9m</p> <p><strong>\u25c0 </strong>Luka Modric, Real Madrid, \u00a330m; Niko Kranjcar, Dynamo Kyiv, \u00a35.5m; Vedran Corluka, Lokomotiv Moscow, undisc; Steven Pienaar, Everton, \u00a34.5m; S\u00e9bastien Bassong, Norwich, undisc; Rafael van der Vaart, Hamburg, \u00a310m; Ryan Nelsen, QPR, free; Louis Saha, Sunderland, released;</p> <h2>West Ham United</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>Sam Allardyce has overhauled his Championship play-off winning squad but it has been the loan signing of Andy Carroll that has quickened the pulses at West Ham.

Ben Foster's permanent signing was tied up quickly and the club look to have unearthed another gem in Claudio Yacob, who arrived on a free.</p> <p>Romelu Lukaku has arrived with a point to prove and has given Steve Clarke, the new manager, plenty of forward options for the season ahead.</p> <p><strong>The deals (selected)</strong></p> <p>\u25b6<strong> </strong>Ben Foster, Birmingham City, undisc; Markus Rosenberg, Werder Bremen, free; Claudio Yacob, Racing Club de Avellaneda, free; Romelu Lukaku, Chelsea, loan; Yassine El Ghanassy, AA Gent, loan; Goran Popov, Dynamo Kiev, loan</p> <p><strong>\u25c0 </strong>Keith Andrews, Bolton, free; Joe Mattock, Sheffield Wed, free; Nicky Shorey, Reading, free; Somen Tchoyi, released; Martin Fulop, Asteras Tripoli, free; Paul Scharner, Hamburg, free; Simon Cox, Nottm Forest, undisc;</p> <h2>Wigan Athletic</h2> <p><strong>Did they get what they wanted?</strong></p> <p>Roberto Mart\u00ednez claims to be satisfied with Wigan's work and the quality of their additions certainly justifies that stance.
