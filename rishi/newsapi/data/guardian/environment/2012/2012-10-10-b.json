  "<p>A serious man for serious times was the pose, and it was the shrewdest option available for David Cameron in Birmingham. Like Gordon Brown in 2008 \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7631925.stm\" title=\"\">this is no time for a novice</a>\" \u2013 as the one at the helm while the economy has taken a fresh dive, the prime minister decided that statesmanlike was the only way to go.</p> <p>The tone of grim realism made for an effective contrast with Boris Johnson's empty but <a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2012/10/09/boris-johnson-speech-in-full\" title=\"\">entertaining optimism</a> 24 hours before, the first task of a leader who is not loved by his party. Also rattled by <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9582489/Ed-Miliband-the-speech-in-full.html\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband's one-nation pitch</a>, the PM zoned in on lingering mistrust about the opposition's ability to steward public funds, and quipped that an instinct to answer every problem with a cheque made for \"one-notion Labour\". If that was two tasks which <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/david-camerons-speech-conservative-conference-full-text\" title=\"\">the speech</a> acquitted, the third objective was to restore the Cameron stock of the character thing. This, too, was accomplished \u2013 through a measure of integrity. With the important exception of welfare, of which more in a moment, the PM did not fully embrace the white-van Conservatism which has been on show all week \u2013 bravely defending international aid, and forgoing the chance to bring the hall to its feet with some line about butchering a burglar. He has left it to others to do such dirty work, and so avoided finally burying his modernisation drive.</p> <p>The greatest potential strength of the speech, however, was that it eschewed easy gimmicks, like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/09/george-osborne-shares-rights-scheme?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the silly shares scheme</a> George Osborne had insisted on pulling from his hat, in favour of a real argument. Unfortunately, this argument was badly awry \u2013 to the point where it became Mr Cameron's greatest failing. The presentation was solid, as was the framing about the changing balance of world power: he located Britain's challenges by looking outward, while Mr Miliband had turned in to concentrate on one nation alone. The problem was the substance \u2013 the tired claim that the slump was at heart a public debt crisis, as opposed to a wider malaise which excessive austerity has aggravated. Mr Cameron suggested that if it were not for the Osborne axe, we'd all be paying \u00a31,000 a year more on our mortgages. That might have been true in a boom, but it is palpably false in a depressed global environment in which the big countries that have hung on to their own printing presses (think America, Japan) have discovered that investors' yearning for government paper allows them to spend without pushing up interest rates. Speaking in the same hall just before the election, Mr Cameron first revealed a deeply ideological reading of the crisis when he styled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/08/david-cameron-speech-in-full\" title=\"\">big government as its cause</a>. Three years on \u2013 as a prime minister who has found out the hard way that the private sector will not magically fill the government gap \u2013 he sounded not merely dogmatic but deluded, as he reheated the argument in almost Tea Party terms: \"We're here because they spent too much and borrowed too much.\"</p> <p>Beyond the economy, he restricted himself to the two themes that No 10 hopes will shape election 2015 \u2013 schools and welfare. On the former, the PM mouthed a fervent faith that dismembering local education authorities through the academy programme will allow every school to do for its pupils what Eton did for him. Seeing as the LEAs are a mixed bunch, it seems unlikely that their withering will produce uniform improvement, even ignoring the financial squeeze. There is, by contrast, nothing mixed about the likely results of slashing social security. Mr Cameron caricatured claimants as living lavishly while others struggle, distorting reality by disregarding the millions who work and nonetheless rely on tax credits and housing benefit to make ends meet. The language was kinder than Peter Lilley's tirade against single mothers a generation ago, but the cuts are bigger today.</p> <p>The focus groups suggest mileage in tapping middle England's resentment, but this is an agenda to cement Britain into two nations. Summoning the statesmanlike tone achieved on Wednesday will not be easy in future, should Britain fall prey to dogma and division.</p>",
  "<p>Facebook has been accused of taking the British taxpayer for a ride after experts suggested the company had depressed sales figures and that the website's average UK employee earned more last year than the whole social media network paid the exchequer.</p> <p>The British arm paid its 90 UK-based staff an average of \u00a3275,000 each in 2011 while contributing just \u00a3195,890 to the Treasury's coffers, according to the firm's latest accounts filed at Companies House.</p> <p>The website also reported UK revenues of \u00a320.4m, a fraction of the \u00a3175m that media analysts estimate the firm made in the UK in 2011.</p> <p>Most of the sales are believed to have been booked in the firm's international headquarters in Dublin, where they will attract lower corporation taxes.</p> <p>Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK, said: \"The UK is being taken for a ride. Facebook is taking standard practice for these IT companies to a new high, or low, depending on how you look at it. The UK is giving the tax break and the Irish get benefit of all the tax on the sales.\"</p> <p>The chartered accountant added that the arrangement between Facebook UK and its Dublin office suggests that only around 11% of total sales made into the UK are declared in this country \u2013 a standard industry mechanism whereby a UK-based company is paid a commission for the sales it generates by a sister company located in a lower tax jurisdiction.</p> <p>Furthermore, Facebook UK's latest figures show that the company charged \u00a315.4m to its 2011 accounts \u2013 which can be used to reduce future tax bills \u2013 as a cost of awarding its UK staff share options. Murphy said: \"That appears to be \u00a315.4m to reward \u00a320.4m in sales. That makes no sense. The options must, of course, be based on the value of sales recorded in Ireland but the UK is bearing the cost of the tax relief on paying these options.\"</p> <p>When asked if Facebook had chosen to set up its international headquarters in Dublin in order to lower its tax bill, a company spokeswoman responded: \"We have our international headquarters in Ireland that employs hundreds and a series of smaller local offices providing support services all over Europe. Dublin was selected as the best location to hire staff with the right skills to run a multilingual hi-tech operation serving the whole of Europe.\"</p> <p>Media research group Enders estimates that Facebook UK made \u00a3175m in revenues in 2011, which it predicts will increase to \u00a3236m this year. The company analyses factors such as how many advertisements are being placed on Facebook, the number of users and how long they spend on the site, as well as surveying advertising agencies and large advertisers.</p> <p>Overall, Facebook UK reported a \u00a310.2m loss in the UK last year, although the company appeared to admit that the published numbers showed little resemblance to how the business is trading.</p> <p>In a statement it added: \"The information does not necessarily present a full account of overall global financial performance so it would be a mistake to draw any conclusions from these filings.\"</p> <p>Facebook's UK accounts were audited by accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, which declined to comment on its work.</p> <p>The news of the tiny UK tax bill comes a week after the group said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/04/facebook-hits-billion-users-a-month\" title=\"\">one billion people use the network every month</a>, which equates to one in seven people in the world. To mark the milestone, founder Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100518568346671\" title=\"\">wrote</a>: \"Helping a billion people connect is amazing, humbling and by far the thing I am most proud of in my life\".</p> <p>However, the success of the soaring user numbers has not been mirrored by the company's share price, which has halved since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/21/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-loses-2bn?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">listing on Wall Street's Nasdaq exchange in May at $38 a share</a>.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron is a tactician not a strategist. He is also the Conservative party's greatest political asset. In his <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19890459\" title=\"\">conference speech</a> on Wednesday he gave us another reminder of why this is still so, even after all the Birmingham <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19883045\" title=\"\">BoJo hoohaa</a>. Whether it is enough to win his party the next general election is more doubtful.</p> <p>It is worth reminding ourselves that this prime minister always watches his back. \"We are not safe, Clarence, we are not safe,\" warns Shakespeare's Richard III, and to understand Cameron, we must try to imagine him in similar vein. He can often surprise colleagues with his insecurity. The fate of Australian Labor's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/27/australia-problem-kevin-rudd-gillard\" title=\"\">Kevin Rudd</a>, a one-time political golden boy unceremoniously mugged by his party, is a favourite Cameron text.</p> <p>His chief aim this week has not been to give a great conference speech. It has been to survive. The fear leading up to Birmingham of what a combination of a bumptious Boris Johnson and a bloodsport-inclined media might do if they gained the upper hand should not be underestimated. In the end, Johnson did more or less what No10 demanded, and the media led on the stories on the government's grid, not on the Tories in crisis. But it was a close thing.</p> <p>So Cameron lives to lead another year. But it has been the most difficult conference of his seven in charge of the party. Like Nick Clegg, but unlike Ed Miliband, Cameron went into the conference season with genuinely serious offstage mutterings against his leadership. Like Clegg, he had successfully called his enemies' bluff. At Birmingham the disaffected mostly zipped their lips or sulked in their tents \u2013 nice tents paid for by Lord Ashcroft in some cases. But that doesn't mean that Cameron can or will relax.</p> <p>Wednesday's lowered-expectations speech was not the one Cameron would have wanted to give at this stage of the cycle. Two and a half years into their term, both coalition parties want to have more to show for their time at the top. But economic stagnation has reshaped their agenda, and may have reshaped British politics for a generation too. Cameron has clocked this more effectively than some others. Yesterday he called it an hour of reckoning for countries like Britain, a time of \"sink or swim\". This is not the language that politicians facing elections like to use.</p> <p>But it is still not clear that Cameron is truly serious about that reshaping. His career has been full of examples of his ability to grasp the need for change without grasping what needs to be done to make it happen. It is one thing to argue, as he did, that Britain should not have a false sense of security, and should grasp the scale of the global changes that are driving new countries to rise and others \u2013 like most European states, including Britain \u2013 to slide. But Cameron's answer to that epochal change hardly measures up. Individual aspiration is all well and good \u2013 better than that, indeed \u2013 but when it is invoked in the way that Cameron invoked it yesterday, it feels like a late-20th century boom-time answer to an early 21st century bust-time question. It is less of a strategy for new times than, well, an aspiration.</p> <p>Yet the big weakness of Wednesday's speech was not that it was facile. Every serious political leader in Europe should be trying, as Cameron was trying yesterday, to explain why things will be different and harder in the decades to come than they have been in the decades just past. It was to Cameron's credit that he at least understands this and chose to stand on this ground. No politician or commentator who ignores this is worth taking very seriously.</p> <p>Parts of Cameron's speech were pure political tactics. The emphasis on the long hard road ahead is not just a tacit admission of failure \u2013 though it is that too. It is also an attempt to push Labour into a position where it appears naively unrealistic about the seriousness of the economic challenge. Fair enough, that's politics, and Labour will need to respond to it with something more sophisticated than abuse if the voters are to be persuaded.</p> <p>But a large part of Cameron's argument yesterday was also predicated on the promise that Britain can in some meaningful way go it alone. He offers what one could call a one-nation strategy against Europe, or against the world. And this us-against-the-world vision is, quite simply, an illusion.</p> <p>It is an illusion which is nevertheless at the heart of the modern Tory party. There was not much said about Europe in Birmingham. Not even Ken Clarke tried. But there is no secret why this is so. The modern Tory party is now an entirely Eurosceptic party. Not surprisingly, the eurozone crisis has cemented this fact still more firmly.</p> <p>And yet, remarkably, the Tory party does not have a European strategy. You might think, if you were being rational, that a leader setting out the agenda for an \"aspiration nation\" might be able to say how this nation aspired to relate to the rest of the world. Yet Cameron said almost nothing about this. His speech pretended to be about 21st century Britain's place in the global scheme, but it was as though the real rest of the world \u2013 including the European neighbours who will remain Britain's neighbours and principal markets whatever happens in the eurozone, as well as a United States increasingly reorientating towards the Pacific \u2013 did not exist.</p> <p>The modern Tory party is living a lie on this issue, and Cameron is too weak, too scared or too compromised to address it strategically. Let sleeping dogs lie is not always a foolish policy. But the problem is that much of the Tory party wants nothing more than to leave the European Union. In or out? They want out. This fact prevents Cameron from telling his party the truth and encourages him to perpetuate the ourselves-alone illusion.</p> <p>The Cameron government's guilty secret is that it understands that full withdrawal would be undesirable for Britain. Ministers know this but won't say so. They dangle a referendum, but not the in-out one the party or the Europhobes crave. As a result, the Ukip threat to the Tories rises.</p> <p>Cameron needed to get his party behind him yesterday by reminding them, and the country, why he is their best asset. He succeeded enough to return to London after a better week than he feared. Cameron won a tactical battle this week, not a strategic victory. To do that he would need the strategic vision he still lacks and that the Tory party does not wish to contemplate.</p>",
  "<p>Police in the country's biggest force are to use the licensing laws to shut down pubs and clubs where high levels of rape and sexual assaults take place as part of a radical attempt to create a hostile environment for rapists.</p> <p>In his first interview, the new head of the Metropolitan police's sex crime unit, Sapphire \u2013 which has been beset by controversy \u2013 has revealed a rape prevention strategy that will target men and women.</p> <p>It will challenge male behaviour while attempting to speak to women about reducing their vulnerability to rape.</p> <p>Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Duthie is taking action as the Metropolitan police investigates a big decrease in rape reporting, which has sparked an outcry from victims' groups concerned that women have lost confidence in the police because of failings in the unit supposed to be the gold standard for the country.</p> <p>This month a former Sapphire officer, Ryan Coleman-Farrow, faces sentence for failing to investigate rapes, pursue suspects or submit evidence over a three-year period. His activities have left 11 alleged sex attackers at large.</p> <p>At Southwark crown court, Coleman-Farrow has admitted 13 counts of misconduct in public office for failing to investigate 10 rapes and three sexual assaults over three years. The officer, who was based in Kingston upon Thames, south-west London, has admitted falsifying computer records to bring cases to an end when no such decision had been made.</p> <p>Another detective from Sapphire is being investigated as part of what one source said was a major inquiry by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into almost identical offences to Coleman-Farrow.</p> <p>Duthie said he was determined to root out below-standard officers. \"It is a big responsibility investigating rape; if we get it wrong, a rapist walks free, I don't want that to happen on my watch.\" His tactics to bring more rapists to justice and prevent sex attacks taking place include:</p> <p>\u2022 Using the licensing laws for the first time to shut down pubs and clubs which generate a high level of rapes and sexual assaults.</p> <p>\u2022 Using covert police tactics to target men who have never been charged and convicted of rape, but where intelligence suggests they are perpetrators.</p> <p>\u2022 A hard-hitting prevention campaign to target male behaviour and speak to women about reducing their vulnerability.</p> <p>\u2022 Increasing supervision of his officers by restructuring Sapphire into five or six large regional teams.</p> <p>He also pledged to reduce what he says is the unacceptable 13 hours it takes on average for victims to be interviewed and medically examined after reporting rape.</p> <p>On the unprecedented use of licensing laws to deter potential sex offenders, he said: \"If you were in Lewisham High Street at night and someone had a glass or bottle stuck in their neck, we would use the licensing legislation to close that place down. But until now we haven't done that for sexual offences.</p> <p>\"We are looking at areas that generate high levels of sexual offences, identifying nightclubs or pubs where this might happen, and which we can link back to rapes and use the licensing laws against these premises.\"</p> <p>Duthie admits using covert policing tactics is unlikely to lead to the male targets being convicted of rape. Instead he hopes they will be taken off the streets for other offences. \"These are Al Capone type tactics. We will possibly end up prosecuting them for something other than rape. We don't want them out there committing sexual offences so if they are disqualified from driving or locked up for having weapons this will help prevent rape.\"</p> <p>Duthie's new rape prevention campaign takes its lead in part from a strategy launched in Scotland last month. \"We can stop it\" targets young men aged 18-27 and asks them to consider their behaviour and become role models with their peers to prevent rape.</p> <p>Duthie is aware that the Met's intention to target women as well as men could prove controversial. \"We have to make sure we are not targeting the victims but the suspects,\" said Duthie. \"But we do need to educate people that if they go out and get hammered they are vulnerable \u2013 vulnerable to being assaulted \u2013 vulnerable to falling over and vulnerable to being raped.</p> <p>\"80% of our victims have one form of vulnerability or another, a permanent or temporary vulnerability through drink, drugs, mental health, age. So there are things that we can do to prevent the offence happening in the first place.\"</p> <p>One of Duthie's biggest challenges is the big fall in the reporting of rapes in greater London over the last year, which appears to buck the national trend. Women's groups blame a loss of confidence in the police due to the high-profile failures by Sapphire in the past five years.</p> <p>In greater London, the latest figures show the reporting of rape is down 15% from April to the end of September to 1,444 reports, compared with 1,712 for the same period last year.</p> <p>\"This is a concern for us,\" said Duthie. \"Is that because there's less rape happening, is it because we are intervening earlier in domestic violence or is it because there are fewer people reporting?</p> <p>\"If they are not reporting, why are they not reporting? Is it because victims are losing confidence because there is a perception they won't get justice, and people wont get charged? We are doing significant work at the moment with our partners looking into all of that.\"</p> <p>He said that although reporting of rapes was down, detections were up since he had taken over \u2013 with 330 men charged between April to September this year compared with 259 in the same period last year.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Women Against Rape said the new tactics were a diversion. \"These so-called prevention strategies are a diversion from what's needed: thorough unbiased investigations and prosecutions so rapists are caught and convicted, and rape is discouraged,\" the spokeswoman said.</p> <p>\"Telling men not to rape will have no effect when the reality is that 93% of rapes don't reach conviction. Victims want their attackers prosecuted for rape, not for some unconnected crime.</p> <p>\"What makes women vulnerable is that the authorities side with the rapist rather than the victim: victims are disbelieved, especially if they have been attacked before.\"</p>",
  "<p>Over 40 controversial road schemes abandoned by successive governments or defeated at public inquiry on environmental grounds have been revived as part of Britain's largest road-building programme in 25 years.</p> <p>Dubbed \"zombie roads\" because they were declared dead years ago but have now been resuscitated, they include a \u00a3100m bypass around Hereford, a new six-lane road through the Peak district, a dual carriageway through the Norfolk broads and a \u00a31bn \"super highway\" to run much of the way from London to Ipswich. Other revived plans include a new Thames river crossing and the widening of the A303 past Stonehenge.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/roads\" title=\"\">the Department for Transport</a>, only 44 national road schemes are presently under way or planned, but research of local authority plans by the <a href=\"http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/campaigns/roads-to-nowhere/map\" title=\"\">Campaign for Better Transport</a> has identified <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2012/oct/10/road-proposals-campaign-better-transport\" title=\"\">a further 150 schemes</a> ranging from bypasses around villages to motorway-grade road improvements.</p> <p>In addition, roads minister Stephen Hammond has recently floated the idea of a new Oxford-Cambridge road and a possible motorway stretching along the south coast.</p> <p>\"Plans for [many of] these roads have already been fought and defeated. But like zombies, they keep coming back. Their impacts haven't changed and local opposition will be just as strong,\" said Chris Gillham, a veteran of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twyford_Down\" title=\"\">Twyford Down</a> protests.</p> <p>Money for many of the proposed schemes is not guaranteed but groups of local authorities working with businesses are expected to share costs with central government on their priority schemes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/12cbdf3a-0a11-11e1-8d46-00144feabdc0.html#axzz28nlJsd2U\" title=\"\">Government and business lobby group the CBI expect some of the biggest road schemes </a>to be funded by countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, pension funds and other international investors.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/media/1775599/cbi_roads_funding_report.pdf\" title=\"\">CBI</a> pressed for privatisation of the English roads to raise the money needed to build more and improve infrastructure. National road pricing has been ruled out on existing roads for the duration of this parliament but the DfT has said it would consider proposals in future to build new roads with private capital through tolling.</p> <p>\"Without a change of approach, the UK's roads infrastructure will ... continue to slip down the international league tables. We need a gear change in how we manage and pay for our road network in the 21st century. A lack of investment means we are really struggling to increase road capacity, let alone adequately maintain what we already have,\" said John Cridland, CBI director-general.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Campaign for Better Transport (CBT)</a>, which has calculated that the 190 known schemes would cost a minimum of \u00a320bn and possibly far more, has warned that the new roads would not solve the problems of congestion or kick-start the economy, but would damage the environment and generate fierce local opposition.</p> <p>Many of the schemes will be environmentally controversial. Work is expected to start shortly on the \u00a393m Hastings to Bexhill link road which will destroy a tranquil valley and has been <a href=\"http://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/news/local-news/green-opposition-for-hastings-to-bexhill-link-road-plan-1-3636013\" title=\"\">described by green groups as the most environmentally harmful and least economically justifiable</a> road scheme currently being proposed in England. Other schemes will pass areas of outstanding beauty, national parks, green belt land and sites of special scientific interest.</p> <p>\"It seems like the lessons of the 1990s have been completely lost, with both local and national government going back to a large programme of road building. From playing fields and precious farmland to national parks, every green space is now at risk from these projects. It would be a massive step backwards to put billions into building zombie roads schemes that will, in the end, just generate more traffic. We know now that we can do better with more sensible transport spending, and if the government tries to resurrect the old thinking of the 1990s, we will defeat them again,\" said <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si%C3%A2n_Berry\" title=\"\">Sian Berry,</a> road campaigner with the CBT.</p> <p>In Hereford where Conservative party plans for a city bypass to be built over sensitive water meadows were dropped from the national programme in 1998 by Labour, local groups vowed to keep fighting a new version of the same road. \"Nothing has dislodged the road from the county council's top aspirations. It has no qualms about trashing the environment. We will fight another 20 years if we have to. I can see a revival of direct action,\" said Paige Mitchell who fought the road 20 years ago.</p> <p>The new road programme proposed by local authorities compares with the Conservative party's \u00a324bn \"roads for prosperity\" programme designed to expand the motorway network, build up to 500 bypasses and massively boost the car economy in 1989. This was said by the Margaret Thatcher government to be \"the biggest road programme since the Romans\", but most were later dropped after protests in the 1990s.</p> <p>\"We learned decades ago that the huge cost of new roads makes them very poor value investments. Where the money is spent instead on good maintenance, better public transport, easier-to-find information about buses and trains, safer roads for walking and cycling and technology to use the roads more efficiently, we are seeing real improvements in congestion at a fraction of the cost,\" said Berry.</p>",
  "<p>It was an unlikely setting for the prime minister to pay a compliment to the man who seeks to unseat him. But in closing the party conference season David Cameron left no doubt that Ed Miliband had succeeded, in the argot of elite sport, in getting inside his head.</p> <p>A speech that brought praise from allies relieved to hear at last a coherent case for Cameron Conservatism was nevertheless strikingly defensive, as if drafted with the Labour leader hovering over the author's shoulder.</p> <p>That much was obvious in the attempt to repel last week's raid by Miliband on the traditionally Tory terrain of one nation. \"We don't preach about one nation but practise class war,\" Cameron said, aiming to shove Labour's tanks off the Conservatives' lawn. He later quipped that Miliband's monomaniacal insistence on stimulus spending meant that Labour was \"the party of one notion: more borrowing\".</p> <p>Proof that Labour attacks have got under the PM's skin \u2013 or at least sufficiently worried his pollsters that they had to be parried \u2013 came in a high-risk passage in which he spelled out the criticisms one by one. \"'Tory cuts, slashing the state \u2026 cruel Tories, leaving people to fend for themselves \u2026 elitist Tories, old-fashioned and out of touch.'\" Of course he countered each charge as he made it, but one assumes an enterprising Labour activist has already chopped the clips together to make an online video: \"David Cameron: in his own words.\" </p> <p>There were subtler signs too that the Tories take Miliband much more seriously now than they did a fortnight ago. Among them: a section in Cameron's speech headed \"Labour\" that was longer than the one labelled \"Economy\"; a detailed response to Labour's demand for a Plan B, arguing that any new borrowing for investment would drive up interest rates; and disparaging references to \"intellectuals of other parties\" and \"Labour party theorists\" which surely pointed to one man in particular. Even an otherwise affecting passage on Cameron's father seemed designed to make a tacit contrast with Miliband's personal history: \"Not a hard luck story, but a hard work story.\"</p> <p>Glad though the Conservative tribe were to see their leader hit back at Labour, the source of the warm welcome they gave him lay elsewhere.</p> <p>They applauded the speech because it dealt, methodically, with several of the anxieties they have had about Cameron and the government he leads. Plenty of Tories have complained in recent months about a sense of drift at the top, worrying that the government is buffeted by events \u2013 from Andrew Mitchell's pleb problem to the west coast rail fiasco \u2013 with no clear story to tell.</p> <p>So they were relieved to hear Cameron in crisp, cogent form with a speech that, if it lacked rhetorical pyrotechnics, had a solid structure.</p> <p>He came to make what he called a \"serious argument\". As Tony Blair had done, he used his conference platform to warn the country that in a world turned upside down by global competition, Britain risked falling behind if it did not sharpen up its act. We could either be \"lean, fit\" and on the rise \u2013 or else join those nations who were \"fat, sclerotic\" and on the slide.</p> <p>To secure our place in the former category, we would have to sort out our deficit, welfare state and education system. Once we had, we would see a country of social mobility in which those striving for success could \"achieve [their] dreams\".</p> <p>In making that case, Cameron conveniently focused on the three areas where the coalition is united and Labour is weak: polls show Miliband lags on the economy while his party has been hesitant on education and welfare, unsure whether to oppose government reforms or back them as completing a job Blair started.</p> <p>But Cameron's core argument also dealt with several of his internal critics' nagging concerns. First is the fear that, by focusing on the deficit, the coalition looks like a government of bean-counters, obsessed with the price of everything, appreciating the value of nothing. So the PM insisted that deficit cutting was not merely an economic mission but \"also a moral one\", because only in a sound economy could people fulfil their potential.</p> <p>This was lapped up by the ConservativeHome wing of the party, which has long urged Cameron to embrace a muscular brand of compassionate conservatism, acting for what it calls the \"strivers\".</p> <p>The PM's \"aspiration nation\" slogan may not take off with the public, but it will placate those Tories who have feared that Cameron is fast looking like the head of a government by toffs for toffs. He gave them soundbites to savour, insisting that the Conservatives were the \"party of the want to be- better off\" and \"that I'm not here to defend privilege, I'm here to spread it\".</p> <p>All of this amounted to an answer to a question Tories have long wanted Cameron to address. Given that he can't say how long Britain will have to keep taking the austerity medicine, they have yearned for him to explain again \u2013 and more effectively \u2013 why the treatment is necessary and what the country will look like once it's over. On Wednesday he made a decent stab at that. The result is a conference season that leaves the three main leaders stronger than they were before, at least with their own parties, and which has opened up a genuine and substantive argument between the main two. Both Labour and the Conservatives are now locked in a fight for the centre ground, each claiming to be the authentic voice of One Nation. The shape of the next general election just got clearer.</p>",
  "<p>The UN has warned of increasing meat and dairy prices in the wake of extreme weather in the United States and across large parts of Europe and other centres of global food production.</p> <p>According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in Rome, global wheat production is expected to fall 5.2% in 2012 and yields from many other crops grown to feed animals could be 10% down on last year.</p> <p>\"Populations are growing but production is not keeping up with consumption. Prices for wheat have already risen 25% in 2012, maize 13% and dairy prices rose 7% just last month. Food reserves, [held to provide a buffer against rising prices] are at a critical low level</p> <p>\"It means that food supplies are tight across the board and there is very little room for unexpected events,\" said Abdolreza Abbassian, a senior economist with the FAO.</p> <p>\"The decrease in cereal production this year will result in a significant reduction in world reserves by the close of seasons in 2013, even with world demand sliding as a result of high prices,\" he said.</p> <p>The warning of further food prices came as some British supermarkets said they were struggling to keep shelves stocked with fresh produce and the National Farmers Union (NFU) reported that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/food-prices-rise-wettest-summer?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">UK wheat yields have been the lowest since the late 1980s</a> as a result of abnormal rain fall.</p> <p>The NFU president, Peter Kendall, said: \"There are many farmers who are down 25% to 30% on the wheat crop. In some cases you looked from the outside and you thought, this crop will do over four tonnes to the acre \u2013 and it's been struggling to do three and some cases two tonnes to the acre.\"</p> <p>\"It's been soul-destroying for the farmers growing the crops,\" he said.</p> <p>Kendall added that the increase in the global price of wheat over the past year was also putting pressures on pig and poultry farmers, who rely on grain to feed their livestock.</p> <p>Confirmation of one of the worst global harvests in years will come on Thursday, when the US government is expected to announce that drought and heat damage to crops this year has reduced its wheat, maize and soy harvests by more than 10%.</p> <p>Because the US is by far the world's biggest grower and exporter of grains, this is expected to have repercussions around the world.</p> <p>Farmers are still harvesting their crops but the maize harvest is expected to be the lowest in nine years.</p> <p>Nearly 40% of all US maize is now used in biofuels, further restricting exports and raising prices.</p> <p>British supermarkets said they had not ruled out the prospect of price rises of staple foods, but they pledged to offer \"competitive pricing\" of essential food items in their value and economy ranges.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Waitrose said: \"There's no doubt that this has been an exceptionally tough growing season for our farmers, who have been coping with very bad weather and rising costs for critical inputs such as fuel. We are working closely with all our growers to help them manage their costs and get as much of their crop on our shelves as possible through initiatives such as selling cosmetically imperfect but good-quality fruit and veg \u2013 something we have always done.\"</p> <p>Sainsbury's said in a statement: \"We continue to work with British farmers and growers to get the most out of the crop. We've taken the decision to radically change our approach to buying British fruit and vegetables as a result of this year's unseasonal weather.\"</p> <p>The run of unpredictable weather this season has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/27/ugly-fruit-vegetables-supermarkets-harvest\" title=\"\">left farmers and growers with bumper crops of \"ugly\"-looking fruit and vegetables</a>, with reported increases in blemishes and scarring, as well as shortages because of later crops. This week, Sainsbury's launched a trial of its Basics range of potatoes, which have visible cracks and blemishes, in more than 35 stores in the Midlands. Last month, the supermarket said it was relaxing its rules on the cosmetic appearance of fresh produce.</p> <p>New research by the consumer group Which? found that the average cost of a shopping bill is now \u00a376.83 a week \u2013 an increase of \u00a35.66 in a year. Richard Lloyd, the group's executive director, said: \"The rising price of food is one of consumers' top financial worries and is changing the way we shop. Recent Which? research found more of us are shopping at discount supermarkets and four in 10 people told us they planned to cut back on their food shopping. We want retailers to be clearer about food pricing and offer responsible price promotions that give the consumer the best possible value for money.\"</p> <p>New figures from the charity FareShare \u2013 which fights hunger and food waste in the UK \u2013 shows that lower-income families have cut their consumption of fruit and vegetables by nearly a third in the wake of the recession and rising food prices, to just over half of the five-a-day portions recommended for a healthy diet.</p>",
  "<p>For the naval officers lounging onboard the Argentinian naval vessel ARA Libertad, there could perhaps be worse places to be stranded than the bustling port of Tema, on Ghana's Atlantic coast.</p> <p>But the crew of the three-masted ship may be forced to prolong their stay indefinitely amid a legal dispute between the government of Argentina and a US-based \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/vulture-funds\" title=\"\">vulture fund</a>\".</p> <p>The Ghanaian high court will on Thursday begin hearing a case to determine whether the Libertad is allowed to sail on, or forced to stay in Tema until the Argentinian government pays up $1.6bn claimed by US-based investment fund NML Capital.</p> <p>The fund \u2013 backed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/nov/15/vulture-funds-key-players\" title=\"\">US billionaire Paul Singer</a> \u2013 is suing Argentina on the basis of debts arising from the country's defaulted bond swaps in 2005 and 2010. NML Capital bought bonds from the heavily indebted Argentinian government in 2000, a year before the country's $100bn sovereign default saw most of its debt restructured.</p> <p>The Libertad was detained after the fund \u2013 which has obtained judgments in New York and London awarding it more than $1.6bn (\u00a31bn) from Argentina \u2013 applied to the Ghanaian courts. Previous attempts to seize sovereign assets, including the Argentinian presidential jet, have so far been successfully avoided.</p> <p>\"NML already have five judgments against Argentina, but the problem is you get judgment but there are no assets to enforce it,\" a source close to the case told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"So the lawyers chose Ghana because Argentina had the Libertad \u2013 an asset within the jurisdiction.\"</p> <p>\" Argentina is not even flying its presidential plane anywhere until it has the assurance of the destination country that they are not going to seize it at the request of NML.\"</p> <p>The case has reignited criticism of international investors like Singer, who buy up foreign debt default. Argentina's President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez often lashes out at funds like NML, describing them as \"vultures\" preying on debtor countries.</p> <p>\"The vulture funds have crossed a new line in their attack against Argentina,\" said the foreign ministry in a statement, pledging to \"clear up this hoax staged by unscrupulous financiers\".</p> <p>Although Argentina has little trade with Ghana and no embassy there, the two nations have \u2013 until now \u2013 had friendly ties.</p> <p>\"The Fragata Libertad was visiting the port of Tema upon the official invitation of the government of Ghana,\" said Arturo Antonio Puricelli, Argentinian minister of defence, in a written statement filed before the Ghana high court. Argentina argues the action is a breach of warship immunity under international law, and is expected to argue that the Libertad should be immediately released.</p> <p>\"The annual voyages around the world of the Libertad serve the important role of promoting goodwill relations between the republic and other nations like Ghana,\" said Puricelli. \"Any delays in leaving the port of Tema will jeopardise this official schedule and put at risk the training voyage and mission.\"</p> <p>This is not the first time Singer has clashed with a debt-ridden South American economy. The 68-year-old founder of a $19bn hedge fund called Elliott Management hit the headlines in the late 1990s when he bought debt that Peru had defaulted on for $11.4bn and took the country to court demanding full payment. After a hard-fought legal battle Singer emerged the victor with a $58m payoff.</p> <p>In another case Elliott went after the government of Congo-Brazzaville, uncovering corruption during the court case that eventually forced the government to settle for an estimated $90m on debt for which Elliott paid less than $20m.</p> <p>But it was the financial crisis that made him. In 2006 Singer was warning that banks were creating \"radioactive\" investments from subprime mortgages and other investments that could trigger a global financial crisis. Elliott correctly made a bet that this would be the case, adding to a personal fortune now estimated to be over $1bn. Singer, a prominent backer of the Republican party, has donated $1m to Mitt Romney's election campaign.</p> <p>Ghanaians are also questioning their role in the saga, as the economic consequences of the Libertad's detention at Tema begin to be felt in the west African country.</p> <p>\"This is creating problems for us,\" said Lawrence Atumbine of the Ghana port and harbour authority. \"The berth the Libertad is occupying is where we handle local vessels to be offloaded. It is a very large vessel \u2013 104 metres \u2013 and we cannot use the berth whilst it is there.\"</p> <p>Naval officers on board the Libertad, which serves as a school ship in the Argentian navy, refused to comment on the case but expressed surprise at the court order detaining the ship.</p> <p>\"We are ambassadors and we stay here to build better relationships with the countries we visit,\" said Lu\u00eds Melic\u00e1n, chief of communications on board the Libertad.</p> <p>\"But we have been visiting lots of tourist sites whilst the ship is held in the port. We have been to hotel swimming pools and we have been going to the mall. It's not too bad for us.\"</p>",
  "<p>What a brilliant piece of stagecraft it was. Boris Johnson mounted the platform at the Conservative party conference, set out his script, then peered around and demanded: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19883045\" title=\"\">\"Where is Dave?\"</a> In the seventh row of the stalls, was the answer. The prime minister was laughing so hard it must have hurt, when his dearest private wish can only be that a divine thunderbolt reduces his old mate the mayor of London to a pile of cinders.</p> <p>One of the worst things that can befall any public performer is to do a turn behind somebody who is funnier and more popular than he is. Boris Johnson is not merely much better-loved than the prime minister, he is the most popular politician in Britain, with a plus-30 positive rating in an opinion poll last weekend, against Cameron's minus-21. The public, and especially the young, do not just like the guy; they love him.</p> <p>He was greeted in Birmingham by rock star style acclaim. At a moment when the Conservative faithful recognise that their party is on course to lose the next general election to a rabble of leftwing zombies, they see Boris as the fat white hope, Joan of Arc, Francis of Assisi, El Cid, Superman, Indiana Jones.</p> <p>His speech to conference reflected all his wit, brilliance and showmanship. He is an authentic star, who lights up every room he enters. He makes people laugh and feel good. He sings a song that the British people \u2013 who currently despise almost every other politician in the pack \u2013 will crowd any venue to hear.</p> <p>Why should he not be prime minister? Why should Boris not be the man to leap forward and save party and country from the dark forces? My own answer is that if the mayor of London is the answer, there is something desperately wrong with the question.</p> <p>If the day ever comes that Boris Johnson becomes tenant of Downing Street, I shall be among those packing my bags for a new life in Buenos Aires or suchlike, because it means that Britain has abandoned its last pretensions to be a serious country.</p> <p>I have known the mayor more than 20 years. He worked for me as EU correspondent of the Daily Telegraph and then as a columnist when I was the paper's editor, and I have seen plenty of him since. He is a magnificent journalist and showman. He proved himself the perfect maitre d' for the London Olympics. But few maitre d's are fit to cook the dinner.</p> <p>Most politicians are ambitious and ruthless, but Boris is a gold medal egomaniac. I would not trust him with my wife nor \u2013 from painful experience \u2013 my wallet. It is unnecessary to take any moral view about his almost crazed infidelities, but it is hard to believe that any man so conspicuously incapable of controlling his own libido is fit to be trusted with controlling the country.</p> <p>His chaotic public persona is not an act \u2013 he is, indeed, manically disorganised about everything except his own image management. He is also a far more ruthless, and frankly nastier, figure than the public appreciates.</p> <p>When one of his many sexual affairs was exposed and much trumpeted in the headlines, he telephoned a friend of mine who was then running one of Britain's largest media organisations. \"It's utterly disgraceful what your reporters are doing on-screen about my private life,\" spluttered Boris. \"It's time you realised that I know all about your private life. If your organisation goes on reporting my affairs like this, you'll be reading all about yours in the Spectator [the magazine he then edited].\"</p> <p>My friend responded: \"Stop a minute, Boris, and think about what you just said. There is a word for it, and it is not a pretty one \u2013 'blackmail'.\" Johnson waffled away, muttering that he had never really meant it. But he is much given to making threats, bearing grudges and behaving with malice aforethought.</p> <p>I would not take Boris's word about whether it is Monday or Tuesday. I feel a twinge of regret for speaking so harshly, because I am as susceptible as most of the British people to Johnson's brilliant, warm, funny public persona.</p> <p>But this is not a man who aspires only to fill his familiar slot on the BBC's Have I Got News For You?. Forget all the denials \u2013 Boris yearns with a mad hunger to become prime minister. Some Tory MPs are so panicked by their current standing in the opinion polls that they have persuaded themselves that London's mayor is the future.</p> <p>On the basis of what, some of us would ask. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2012/oct/04/boris-johnson-cycling-accident-statistics-wrong\" title=\"\">Boris bikes</a> on London's streets? The peerless jokes and bonhomie and TV wizardry? Testimonials from ex-lovers who found him amusing in bed? A friend said to me not long ago: \"When will you understand that the reason the young are potty about Boris is precisely because he is not serious, because he treats the whole business of politics as a bit of a lark.\" This is true.</p> <p>But his lovability, or even bonkability, is not the point. One of our biggest problems as a society is that we have become obsessed by the X Factor culture. We no longer look for dignity, gravitas, decency or seriousness of purpose in our leaders in any field. We demand only stardust, a jolly turn in front of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/16/simon-cowell-mediaguardian-100-2012\" title=\"\">Simon Cowell</a> or on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/oct/08/strictly-come-dancing-who-impressed-first-weekend\" title=\"\">Strictly Come Dancing</a>.</p> <p>I knew quite a few of the generation of British politicians who started their careers in 1945 \u2013 the likes of Roy Jenkins, Denis Healey, Edward Heath, Enoch Powell and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Macleod\" title=\"\">Iain Macleod</a>. The common denominator among them all, whatever their party, was that they entered politics passionately believing they could change things. They were serious people. It does not matter whether they were wrong or right \u2013 almost all of them had real beliefs.</p> <p>Today most aspirant politicians of every party have not a personal conviction between them. They merely want to sit at the top table, enjoy power, bask in the red boxes and chauffeur-driven cars, then quit to get as rich as Tony Blair.</p> <p>Boris Johnson was at the Tory conference on Tuesday for one purpose only \u2013 the exaltation of himself. This does not much matter when he is only mayor of London, but would make him a wretched prime minister. He is not a man to believe in, to trust or respect, save as a superlative exhibitionist. He is bereft of judgment, loyalty and discretion. Only in the star-crazed, frivolous Britain of the 21st century could such a man have risen so high, and he is utterly unfit to go higher still.</p> <p><em> \u00a9 Daily Mail 2012</em></p>",
  "<p>The capacity of Cheltenham racecourse will approach the 80,000 that can be accommodated by Ascot following the long-awaited construction of a third new grandstand, executives at the track said on Wednesday. Work on the development could begin within 18 months, which would mean that the 2016 Festival meeting would be the first to take place in front of the completed facility.</p> <p>The pace of local planning procedures will determine precisely when work on the new stand, which will increase the capacity by at least 10,000, can begin. It will be necessary to demolish the current buildings on the site \u2013 the royal box and a number of annual members' boxes \u2013 immediately after one Festival meeting in March in order to complete work in time for the Festival two years later.</p> <p>Edward Gillespie, who is now in his final few weeks as Cheltenham's managing director after 32 years in the role, said at the annual launch for the track's new season that the stand will be the \"largest single development ever undertaken\" at the course. Its construction will be overseen by Ian Renton, his successor, who expects a planning application to be submitted in the new year.</p> <p>\"It will be a very substantial building,\" Gillespie said, \"replacing the current royal box which was built in 1952 and about 45 other boxes which are fairly basic and were built in the 1920s and 1930s.</p> <p>\"Some of those box-holders and their families have been involved here for many generations and are very much part of the DNA of Cheltenham. The intention is to provide them with something in the new development that they will recognise as an environment they enjoy, but very much a 21st century version of what they will be losing.\"</p> <p>Until the new facility is complete, however, attendance at Gold Cup day, the final and most popular day for the Festival meeting, will be capped at 67,000, in response to complaints from some racegoers about crowding at last year's event.</p> <p>\"It will be a drop of about 5%,\" Gillespie said. \"Due to the sheer number of people on Gold Cup day, a number of people told us they found it very difficult to get around at the back of the site. We believe that capping the attendance will make a significant difference to people's comfort.\"</p> <p>Racing returns to the main track at Cheltenham on 19 October, while the following month will bring the return of action on the cross-country course, which claimed the lives of two horses on the first day of last season's Festival, when the going was significantly faster than on the main track. The cross-country course was also the scene of a controversial incident at last year's December meeting, when five horses took the wrong course.</p> <p>\"The cross-country course provides opportunities for horses that might not otherwise get a chance,\" Simon Claisse, the clerk of the course said. \"In relation to the wrong-course incident, we will make sure that it cannot happen again by changing some of the running rail arrangements. In relation to the two casualties at the Festival, we had produced ground that was watered in parts and it is ironic that the areas where we had watered were where the incidents occurred.</p> <p>\"There was no attribution to [fast] ground in terms of the injuries, but we have applied to increase the amount of water we can extract from our [on-site] brook and have plans for further water storage. If we felt that it was the right thing to do in future, we would have the capability to apply more water on that course.\"</p> <p>Andy Clifton, Cheltenham's communications manager, also confirmed that there are no plans at present to change the four-day, Tuesday-to-Friday format of the Festival meeting.</p> <p>Frankel pleased his connections in a racecourse gallop at Newmarket on Wednesday morning, when he readily pulled clear of Midsummer Sun. \"Everything went very well, it was a good bit of work and we were all very happy,\" said Teddy Grimthorpe, representing the horse's owner, Khalid Abdulla. Frankel is expected to have his final outing in the Champion Stakes at Ascot a week on Saturday.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron laid out on Wednesday the Conservative party's election battleground, paring it down to welfare, education and an attack on profligate Labour borrowing, while also addressing the elitism in his own personal story by saying his mission was to spread, rather than hoard, privilege .</p> <p>Closing his party conference with a counter-attacking speech, designed to repel Labour's ideological One Nation land grab, Cameron insisted a modern, compassionate Conservative party was leading the fight against poverty in Britain. It was not the party of the better off, but the \"want to be better off\", he said.</p> <p>He said it had fallen to him to lead the mission to create an \"aspiration nation\", in which dependency on welfare was ended and the toxic culture of low expectation in schools was thrown aside.</p> <p>He said Labour was a party of one notion \u2013 more borrowing \u2013 and simply did not grasp the scale of the global forces threatening the UK from China to Nigeria.</p> <p>The decision to focus on welfare reform and low aspiration in education, as well as attack Labour on spending, was a conscious move to focus on the areas where the coalition parties believe most has been achieved. Cameron claimed: \"These are not just battle lines for Britain's future, but also battlelines for the next election\".</p> <p>Implictly acknowledging he may have allowed Labour to fill some ideological space, he said he may have erred in failing to explain himself and his modernising mission enough. He said: \"The party has a heart but we don't like wearing it on our sleeve. Conservatives think 'let's just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it'. It's not our style.</p> <p>\"But there is a problem with that. It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are \u2013 the cartoon Conservatives who don't care.</p> <p>\"The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we are the same old Tories that want to help the rich. It's because we are the Tories whose ideas help everyone \u2013 the poorest the most\".</p> <p>He said welfare reform was not working, arguing that the only route out of poverty was work, a message his pollsters insist resonates in Labour areas.</p> <p>He also tried to appropriate Labour's academies programme, claiming it was \"the old educational establishment \u2013 the leftwing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists\" who stood in the way of their expansion.</p> <p>In a bid to counter the claim that he stands for elitism in education, he said he was on the side of parents demanding the discipline and rigour displayed by the academies. He said: \"Isn't the great disadvantage of all being written off by those so in hock to a culture of low expectations that they have forgotten what it is like to be ambitious, to want to transcend your background to overcome circumstance and succeed on your own terms?</p> <p>\"Its the toxic culture of low expectations \u2013 the lack of ambition for every child \u2013 which has held this country back\".</p> <p>He tried to address criticism about his Etonian schooling: \"To all those people who say 'he wants children to have the kind of education he had at his posh school', I say 'yes I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education. I'm not here to defend privilege. I'm here to spread it'.\"</p> <p>In a speech that said next to nothing on policing, immigration, civil liberties or the European Union, issues that had dominated many cabinet members' speeches, Cameron defended the NHS, his overseas aid programmes and commitment to a socially liberal society, the classic symbols of Cameron's modernising project.</p> <p>In the most difficult passage, he addressed the state of the economy in the wake of the latest IMF report which again downgraded UK growth.</p> <p>He said: \"I know you are asking whether the plan is working and here is the truth: the damage was worse than we thought and it's taking longer than we hoped.\"</p> <p>He blamed the slowing of the world economy, especially in the EU, over the past two years, but told delegates: \"Here is the crucial thing you need to know: yes, it's worse than we thought; yes, it's taking longer, but we are making progress.</p> <p>He said \"it was a time of reckoning\", when the country would \"either sink or swim, do or decline\". Faced by global forces such as China, he said he was determined not to let his country slide, but instead to rise.</p> <p>In a typically optimistic passage, he argued: \"Aspiration is the engine of progress. Countries rise when they allow their people to rise . That is why the mission of this government is to build an aspiration nation to unleash and unlock all the promise in all our people.\"</p> <p>He gingerly suggested the economy was on the mend, citing the creation of 1m new jobs in the private sector, saying this was in net terms more than Labour managed in 10 years. In his only specific growth measure, he said Britain's planning laws would have to be scrapped so more housing could be built, vowing to scrap \"the suffocating bureaucracy\" that he said was holding economic growth back.</p> <p>He said: \"There are too many 'yes but no' people. The ones who say: 'Yes, our business needs to expand, but no, we cannot reform planning'.\"</p> <p>\"If we are going to be a winner in this global race, we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all.\"</p> <p>He attacked the so-called Nimbys. It had been \"OK for his generation that had got on the housing ladder\", he said, but the average age that people bought their first home today without any help from their parents was 33.\"We are the party of home ownership. We cannot let this carry on. We have to accept we need to build more houses in Britain,\" he said.</p> <p>\"There are people who work hard year after year but are still living at home. They sit in their childhood bedroom looking out of the window, dreaming of a place of their own.\"</p> <p>He launched a number of attacks on Labour, but was silent on his Liberal Democrat coalition partners. He criticised Labour leader Ed Miliband by saying: \"While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you. They call us the party of the better off. No, we are the party of the want to be better off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families \u2013 and we should never be ashamed of saying so.\"</p> <p>He promised: \"Those with the broadest shoulders would bear the greatest burden. With us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this parliament than in any one of the 13 years under Labour.\"</p> <p>Previewing the attack he will mount at the next election, he said he did not think Labour had learned a single thing. \"When they were in office, their answer was always borrow more money. Now they are out of office, it's borrow more money. Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it is, borrow more money.\"</p>",
  "<p>China, as some pundits like to insist, is different. The same might be said of France, Burundi, Japan or any country with a strong sense of identity. In the case of China, though, we are invited to accept that China can benefit from engagement in the world \u2013 from the globalisation that brought billions of investment into the country, the international trade that fed its long boom, or the raising of billions in capital for Chinese companies on international stock exchanges \u2013 without accepting the rules.</p> <p>The past two years have been unkind to many Chinese companies that were seeking global markets or international capital, what with fraud scandals and suspicions that Chinese companies operate as an arm of the state. The latest report from the US House of Representatives' intelligence committee \u2013 which claims after an 11-month investigation that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/08/china-huawei-zte-security-threat?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Chinese telecoms giant Huawei is closer than it admits to the Chinese military</a> \u2013 falls into the second category and will greatly hamper Huawei's ambitions in the US market. But both the international fraud scandals and the suspicions around Huawei are rooted in the secrecy and corruption that flourishes back home.</p> <p>Huawei strenuously denies the charges and accuses US legislators and regulators of McCarthy-style witch-hunting. The timing has not helped the company: many candidates for US-elected office find China a convenient whipping boy for US-made ills. The congressional elections two years ago, like the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-elections-2012\" title=\"\">presidential elections</a> now, produced some startling anti-China ads that seemed to date from the days when yellow peril was an acceptable term in politics. But the verdict on Huawei \u2013 and the dubious reputation that stalks other Chinese companies with global ambitions \u2013 cannot simply be dismissed as witch-hunting or protectionism.</p> <p>The China difference that generates daily frictions internationally has nothing to do with China's claim to historic exceptionalism \u2013 used, with other recently invented theories, to justify the Communist party's monopoly on power. It is rather the fact that the party bends every rule in China to its own advantage and companies that do not conform to these priorities risk being destroyed. China can legitimately argue that its internal arrangements are its own business, but when Chinese companies are on US or European soil, it becomes our business too.</p> <p>It is not entirely the fault of the companies: even the most ethical and transparent Chinese enterprise can find itself struggling to understand, let alone to adhere to, foreign standards of auditing, transparency, governance and accountability, when it has prospered at home in a system in which secrecy, cronyism, false accounting and connections to power are the default political and business environment, not the exception.</p> <p>The China difference <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/13/china-economic-success-example-world\" title=\"\">served China well</a> as its economy rose on the back of globalisation, the labours of an underpaid workforce, state subsidies and lax enforcement of the rulebook. But now that Chinese companies operate in a global environment and raise capital on international stock exchanges, the China difference is proving intractable for some.</p> <p>When Chinese companies first sought listings on the New York stock exchange, they were greeted with enthusiasm by investors who wanted to buy into the myth of the China miracle. Investors lost millions in hundreds of Chinese companies that listed by the back door, through the perfectly legal practice of buying traded <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_corporation\" title=\"\">US shell companies</a>, thus avoiding the initial scrutiny that accompanies an IPO. Others companies listed in the conventional way, but were subsequently hit by fraud scandals, bringing equally painful losses.</p> <p>Now there is a long and unhappy stand-off between US regulators, in particular the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and the Chinese authorities over China's refusal to allow US regulators to verify the auditing of US-listed companies. Since 2009, China has ordered that the necessary paperwork be withheld, arguing that US regulators should not have authority in China. The dispute is emblematic of the wider clash between China's domestic political system and the rules that prevail elsewhere. As long as China's corruption is endemic and the party continues to insist that rule of law, transparency and good governance come a poor second to Communist party interests, China's ambitious companies will be caught between a domestic regime that demands that rules be bent and an international one that insists they must not be.</p>",
  "<p>Business is on the cusp of a paradigm shift, moving from structures and hierarchies to networks and webs. Insights from nature can act as inspiration for this transition.</p> <p>Thinking in terms of systems is difficult, but it is vital to operating successfully in the increasingly interconnected and uncertain business world. Observations from nature, which is made up complex systems, can yield important lessons.</p> <p>The concept of emergence is fundamental to how nature operates. Physicist and systems theorist, Fritjof Capra, noted that: \"Throughout the living world, the creativity of life expresses itself through the process of emergence.\"</p> <p>Emergence is a term used to explain how complex patterns or systems emerge from a series of simple interactions. Emergent systems create synergy, where the individual components interrelate and lead to the creation of a whole that is greater than the the sum of its parts. In nature this synergy leads to the growth of ecosystems. Humans also display emergent behaviour, from stock-market trends to online interactivity.</p> <p>Take the soil beneath our feet as an example. It is alive with networking, interconnecting, diverse life; it breaks down matter to create new growth. Soil can be likened to organisational culture. From a rich culture, employee enthusiasm thrives. Like soil, over-exploitation through short-term, KPI-focused approaches erode this richness that is so important to growing a resilient, vibrant business.</p> <p>Woven within healthy soil are mycelia (networks of fungi threads), which connect plants with each other to share nutrients and encourage diversity within the ecosystem. Artificial fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides cause mycelia to retreat and the soil to lose a key part of its vibrancy. In the same way that soil can be likened to organisational culture, mycelium networks can be likened to effective communication, collaboration and networking that transcend organisational silos and boundaries. It is the power of these networks that drives business adaptation.</p> <p>For organisations to thrive in increasingly dynamic business environments, they need to connect, collaborate and synergise within diverse systems. Organisational culture provides the foundation for collaborative stakeholder engagement. Just like healthy soil, a healthy organisational culture is rich in diversity and nutrients. Organisational vision and leadership can bring unity within this diversity and a sense of direction which empowers teams to adapt to the rapidly changing business environment.</p> <p>Just like the soil needs mycelia to enable it to thrive, the healthy organisation needs a vibrant network to facilitate continual emergence within its business ecosystem. Encouraging an environment of collaboration for co-creation is a critical success factor for organisations redesigning for resilience.</p> <p><em>Giles Hutchin's new book The Nature of Business can be purchased </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Nature-Business-Redesigning-Resilience/dp/0857840487\" title=\"\"><em>here.</em></a><em> He has more than 15 years of business transformation experience and is embarking on a BBC/Open University documentary of the same title and subject as the book.

  "<p>Less time in the office, and more time in the garden: add these two good ideas together and we can make an even better one. If all new employees in otherwise full-time jobs were given the voluntary option of a shorter, four-day working week, Britain could reap a wide range of economic, social and environmental benefits. This option is standard employment practice in the Netherlands. It could be done flexibly, either by working shorter hours, or by compressing a conventional working week into four days.</p> <p>Individuals could, of course, spend the extra day however they liked. But, if the time was combined with supporting the rapid expansion of productive and pleasurable gardening in the nation's towns and cities, it would help tackle a staggering array of urgent challenges. Britain would be much better off if we adopted a scheme of \"national gardening leave.\"</p> <p>Growing things brings enormous individual health and wellbeing benefits. But the greening of urban space does much more than that. It makes for more convivial towns and cities, can produce a more resilient food economy and acts as an important buffer against the extremes of a warming climate. It's effective against depression, dementia, cardiovascular complaints and a huge range of other medical conditions.</p> <p>The combined cost of physical inactivity, poor diet and mental ill-health in the UK runs into tens of billions of pounds. In a single activity can gardening alleviate all three problems, reducing the need for some public services and increasing our capacity to care for each other. The educational benefits in terms of helping restore attention spans benefit old and young equally. Refamiliarising people with food through growing their own is one of the best ways to learn and improve a diet.</p> <p>In some of the poorest, recession-hit neighbourhoods from Detroit in the US, to Hackney in London, community gardening allows people to help themselves to fresh, healthy food, that otherwise they might not get and strengthens the ties that hold communities together.</p> <p>Increasing urban green space reduces the lethal effect of heatwaves, set to worsen due to climate change, by cooling built-up spaces that become \"heat islands\". They can improve air quality and temper flooding that follows intense rain, also likely to worsen in a warming world.</p> <p>There are hard economic benefits here, the chance for better lives and a more resilient food system, with more of a buffer built-in against volatile weather and food and energy prices. To reap all these, however, requires two key ingredients that appear to be missing, in short supply, or otherwise hard to access.</p> <p>These ingredients are the time to do it, and the physical space to do it in. A study last year of New York, the most densely populated city in the US, found upwards of 6,000 acres that could be put to use in urban farming. How much space could London, or Birmingham or Manchester find if they really looked? Every workplace and public institution in the UK could probably find at least some growing space: in a car park, a window sill or a roof. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/09/supermarket-rooftop-vegetable-garden\" title=\"\">The roof of a Budgens supermarket in North London</a> recently became the home of the initiative \"Food from the sky.\"</p> <p>What about time? A long historical struggle reduced the norm of the working week to what we have now. The next step could make for happier employees, save money and reduce our carbon footprint. That's what happened in the municipality of <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-06-30-four-day_N.htm\" title=\"\">Utah</a> when, in response to the economic crisis of 2008 they put staff onto a four-day week. Absentee rates fell, millions of dollars were saved, and carbon emissions cut 14%. In the UK we have high unemployment coupled with a culture of long hours and overwork. By distributing more equally the work available at any given point in time, more could enjoy the benefits of work while ameliorating the destructive aspects of overwork.</p> <p>Normal isn't working. We need to do something different to improve the shape of life in Britain. To be a national gardening leave employer all you'd need to do is offer new staff (and existing ones where possible) the option of a four-day week. Add a growing space for the rapid expansion of productive and pleasurable gardening, and we can make Britain better, starting now. If you're an employer, and think you can do this, get in touch.</p>",

  "<p>As markets drifted lower once more, <strong>Smith and Nephew</strong> was among the biggest fallers.</p> <p>The medical equipment group, which specialises in artificial hips and knees, stumbled after its shares went ex-dividend and analysts at Societe Generale issued a sell note. They said:</p> <blockquote> Given that we see downside risk to the consensus earnings per share forecasts, that we find the valuation unappealing, and that Smith &amp; Nephew has not executed well on M&amp;A in the past, we are initiating coverage with a sell rating. We are aware that a few upside risks exist, but if they do materialise, they are unlikely to alter our bearish view until 2014. <br> </blockquote> <p>It said the company's research and development programme would take longer than expected to mitigate pressure on prices, while the benefits of its restructuring plans would not entirely offset the cost of its investment programme. It added:</p> <blockquote> If [a] planned US medical device tax does materialise, there will be a further 4% downside to our 2013-2017 earnings per share estimates. <br> Finally, we note that Smith &amp; Nephew is considering an accretive acquisition or buyback. However, given recent management changes, we would not be surprised if this decision gets delayed until 2014. </blockquote> <p>Smith and Nephew lost 17.5p to 655p, a 2.6% decline. Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 33.54 points lower at 5776.71 as the continuing lack of resolution to the eurozone crisis and the IMF's gloomy forecasts for the global economy weighed on sentiment. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> Equity markets have done nothing but grind gradually lower in the past few days as the economic outlook both domestically and outside of the UK has deteriorated. Investors are struggling to find any rational reasons to considerably increase their exposure to equities when there are people left right and centre warning them of stormy waters ahead. <br> Whilst the bulls seem incapable of lifting us higher, the bears are also unable to take control and push us significantly lower. Every time there's a bit of bad economic data we should be seeing markets take a dive, but the prospect of more stimulus from central banks around the world seems to be creating rather a false environment. </blockquote> <p>Banks were boosted by renewed reports of a decision by the Financial Services Authority to relax capital and liquidity rules to stimulate lending. <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> added 1.475p to 38.48p while <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> rose 5.4p to 262.7p ahead of its Direct Line flotation.</p> <p>Meanwhile the mining sector lost earlier gains which followed better than expected third quarter figures from US group Alcoa. However the aluminium producer tempered the good news by echoing recent concerns about a slowdown in China, a key market for commodity companies. So <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> slipped 29p to \u00a330.01, <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> lost 15p to 1920.5p and <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> fell 30p to \u00a310.60.</p> <p>Safer sectors such as water companies were in demand amidst the uncertainty. <strong>United Utilities</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/sep/18/united-utilities-bid-talk-ftse-falls?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">recently the subject of bid speculation</a>, moved higher in the last half hour of trading, ending 11.5p higher at 729p.</p> <p>Chip designers led the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 fallers after downbeat coverage from Credit Suisse. <strong>Arm</strong> lost 17p to 578.5p after the bank issued a neutral rating with a 538p price target. It said:</p> <blockquote> Arm is a strong fundamental bottom-up earnings growth story; however, we estimate that its key growth drivers - smartphones, tablets and notebooks - are already factored into consensus estimates and the valuation. Thus we see limited scope for upside in the near term, especially as we do not see any near-term catalysts for earnings upgrades. <br> </blockquote> <p>Credit Suisse also began coverage of <strong>Imagination Technologies</strong>, down 47p to 455.5p with an underperform recommendation and 347p price target</p> <p>With revived talk of a possible bid from US shareholder Blackrock and others, hedge fund group <strong>Man</strong> added 3.45p to 93.4p.</p> <p>Lower down the market, <strong>Avanti Communications</strong> came down to earth, losing 65p to 283.75p or nearly 19% after the satellite operator's full year results fell short of expectations. Its revenues more than doubled but losses increased from \u00a312.7m to \u00a316m and it adopted \"more conservative accounting treatments\" given a move to the full list. Analyst Robert Corden at Charles Stanley said:</p> <blockquote> The group reported revenues of \u00a312.6m for the year to June 2012 against previous guidance of \u00a317.8m. This shortfall was due to a change of accounting policies on the treatment of certain revenues which will now be recognised over the length of contracts regardless of upfront payment. This change came as a complete surprise to the market and led us to the comment of poor communication. <br> Our preliminary thoughts are that there remains significant upside potential in the share price, but the timing has been very substantially delayed. </blockquote> <p>Finally drug discovery group <strong>Summit Corporation</strong> closed 27% higher at 4.75p after positive results from a clinical trial of its treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a fatal wasting disease. Analysts at N+1 Singer said: </p> <blockquote> Today's news is critical for Summit, as it gives the company a 'green light' for its lead candidate, which investors <br>can now comfortably assume represents a realistic out-licensing proposition. Furthermore the news underlines <br>Summit as a potentially sustainable investment vehicle with a realistic probability of value accretion. </blockquote>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney hit the campaign trail in Ohio and Virginia this week accusing Barack Obama of waging war on coal. But the real enemy of coal, it turns out, is free enterprise \u2013 and strong competition from another home-grown source of American energy: natural gas.</p> <p>Falling prices for natural gas made it far more economical to burn natural gas instead of coal in the country's power plants over the last few years.</p> <p>Environmental regulations \u2013 a favourite target of Romney \u2013 had little to do with the switch.</p> <p>\"This is not rocket science,\" said Michael Levi, an energy analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"This is not any kind of conspiracy or heavy-handed action by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). All it requires is people with calculators making decisions about what to deploy.\"</p> <p>The Republican challenger steps up his campaign as coal defender this week, with appearances in Ohio on Wednesday and Friday.</p> <p>In campaign stops in coal-producing battleground states like Ohio and Virginia, Romney has accused Obama of destroying the industry with burdensome pollution controls.</p> <p>\"I like coal. I'm going to make sure we continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies,\" Romney told Obama at their first debate.</p> <p>Those feelings apparently are mutual.</p> <p>Coal companies have been among the biggest donors to Romney's campaign. Murray Energy Corp has donated more than $1m to Republican candidates this election cycle. A watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, on Tuesday accused Murray Energy of forcing miners to donate to the Romney campaign and to take time off without pay to attend a campaign rally.</p> <p>Coal made up about half of America's electricity mix in 2007, according to the Energy Information Administration, the government research agency. Then the price of natural gas fell sharply because of a boom in domestic production.</p> <p>\"There has been a lot of substitution of natural gas for coal,\" said Steve Clemmer, director of energy research for the Union of Concerned Scientists. A run of warmer winters further reduced demand for coal, he added.</p> <p>By 2011, America was generating just 42% of its electricity from coal. By last April that fell further still to 32%, an all-time low. That number has since crept back upwards towards 40%.</p> <p>\"The industry has taken a pretty big hit this year,\" said Mike Mellish, a coal analyst for the EIA. \"We're talking about more than a 10% decline in the power sector over the last year.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, America's fleet of coal-fired power plants is ageing out. Power managers have already announced plans to phase out about 13% of America's coal-fired plants within the next three to five years. Only a handful of new plants are in the works.</p> <p>More coal-fired plants could come off-line if natural gas prices stay low and if the EPA puts in place more rigorous pollution controls. Coal-fired plants also face increasing competition from renewable energy, like hydro, wind and solar, which receive support from state governments, according to EIA projections.</p> <p>By 2035, natural gas plants are expected to account for 60% of new power capacity, according to the EIA. Coal is expected to account for just 7%.</p> <p>The effects of that transition are already visible in battleground states, as power companies on the Atlantic coast and in the mid-west expand their use of natural gas and cut back on coal.</p> <p>Coal companies shuttered plants and laid off workers. Ohio is set to lose a third of its coal-fired plant capacity over the next several years, Mellish said. Alpha Natural Resources in Virginia announced last month it would lay off 1,200 workers \u2013 blaming the slowdown on a \"regulatory environment that's aggressively aimed at constraining the use of coal\".</p> <p>\"The coal industry likes to blame everything on EPA regulations under the Obama administration, and the reality is that there are quite a few other things driving the reduction in coal that are just economic market factors and some policy-related things related to state policy,\" said Clemmer.</p> <p>New pollution controls from the EPA on emissions of mercury and other toxins are not due to come into force until 2015 at the earliest. Although the EPA did tighten standards for greenhouse gas emissions from new coal plants earlier this year existing plants are exempt.</p> <p>But it is unlikely coal will ever dominate America's electricity supply to the same extent again. New gas field technology, such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, make gas-fired power plants half the cost of coal-fired plants.</p> <p>\"As far as the regulations that have been put into place to date they are a small part of the story why coal is not doing as well as it was a few years ago,\" said Levi.</p>",
  "<p>Speeding north towards Paris on the TGV recently, I opened the latest issue of the Economist, to find the first major article, appropriately on the Schumpeter page, covering Richard Branson's new B Team. Having been somewhat involved in shaping the initiative since last year, and having decided with Puma chairman, and B Team co-president, Jochen Zeitz, that we would align the new book we are writing with the emerging B Team agenda, it was encouraging to see a magazine that has oscillated fairly energetically on the sustainability agenda over the years, taking a broadly positive line.</p> <p>But then I dug deeper into my reading pile and found the <a href=\"http://www.netjetseurope.com/Press/Press-Releases1/2012-Environment-Report/\" title=\"\">2012 environmental report for NetJets</a>. I had been staying with venture capitalist Jan-Olaf Willums, who is on the NetJets environmental advisory board, and had accidentally picked up the report with some other papers. Still, it was a public document and, unlike most company reports I stumble across, turned out to be rather interesting.</p> <p>At a time when there is growing interest in shared consumption, NetJets seems to be taking the concept to new heights. Backed by Berkshire Hathaway, the company offers fractional ownership in private jets. I was intrigued to learn that its history goes back to 1986, a couple of years before Julia Hailes and I published the Green Consumer Guide \u2013 and I confess we never even thought of including private jets in the book.</p> <p>At the time, NetJets founder Richard Santulli was pondering the purchase of his very own private jet. But, as a mathematician and Goldman Sachs executive, he couldn't make the numbers add up: the cost seemed prohibitive, even for someone like him. So he dug into the possibility of co-owning an aircraft with partners, but found that managing the schedule would be impossible: typically, everyone wanted to use the jet at the same time. As Santulli put it: \"The only reason to have a private airplane is if you can use it whenever you need to\".</p> <p>NetJets was his eventual answer: a fractional ownership model offering the benefits of full aircraft ownership, but at a much lower price. Santulli's pioneering idea led to rapid expansion in the US, and NetJets Europe was launched in 1996. As the company history recalls: \"NetJets' success didn't go unnoticed. Renowned American investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett trusted his flying to NetJets, and was so impressed that he bought the company in 1998.\"</p> <p>Well, so far so good. But, as NetJets puts it in its 2012 environmental report, \"the aviation industry has never been more challenged. High oil prices; limited space for expansion of existing airports; rising demand for air travel; cut-throat competition and heightened security demands all present unique challenges.\" But, it then goes on to say, there is no challenge \"greater than the impact of aviation on climate change.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\" title=\"\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> has estimated that aviation is responsible for around 3.5% of anthropogenic climate change, predicting that without further action this figure will grow to between five and 15% by 2050. But on the plus side, NetJets argues, aviation \"has been integral to the growth of the global economy; it makes remote regions accessible and brings long-distance mobility to people. More than two billion passengers take a flight annually, the industry is said to generate 29m jobs, and its is responsible for more than 8% of global GDP.\"</p> <p>So what to do? True, the <a href=\"http://www.ieta.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=324:the-eu-emissions-trading-system&amp;catid=54:3-minute-briefing&amp;Itemid=135\" title=\"\">European commission expects its emission trading scheme</a> (ETS) to cut EU aviation emissions by 46% by 2020, but NetJets decided it could do better. Although NetJets Europe chairman Eric Connor stresses that business aviation contributes just 0.2% to overall aviation emissions, the company launched what it called its 'Real Difference' campaign in 2007, with a view to becoming carbon neutral this year.</p> <p>To date, while NetJets argues that \"it is impossible to achieve zero emissions in the short term,\" it has capped greenhouse gas emissions (down from 234 kilotonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2009 to 229 kilotonnes in 2011), with aircraft operations accounting for 95% of the firm's overall emissions. Aircraft factional owners were offered the option of dropping out of the voluntary carbon offsetting programme, with the \"vast majority\" apparently remaining committed.</p> <p>By the time the 2012 report went to press, the company had offset more than 62,000 flights and 687,343 tonnes of carbon. Five offset projects are flagged in the 2012 report, in Kenya, Uganda, Brazil, Guatemala and Mongolia.</p> <p>Clearly, there are interesting links between what NetJets is trying to achieve and what Richard Branson has been going after with his focus on the use of cleaner biofuels in his aircraft fleet. But even though the Virgin and NetJets initiatives will stimulate some very useful conversations with owners, suppliers, pilots and passengers, my sense is that the combination of a weak ETS and voluntarism is only going to shift the needle so far.</p> <p>That's where the B Team potentially comes in, convening CEOs and other business leaders in a private capacity to address some of the systemic dysfunctions of capitalism. Among the leading candidates for early consideration are the Puma environmental profit and loss accounting approach, an end of quarterly reporting of results and the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies. So all aboard, chocks away and, with at least my fingers firmly crossed, off we go.</p> <p><em>John Elkington is executive chairman of </em><a href=\"http://www.volans.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Volans</em></a><em> and non-executive director at </em><a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com/\" title=\"\"><em>SustainAbility</em></a><em>.

When a substance latches on to the outer part of a sensor protein, it causes it to change shape, triggering a response inside the cell.</p> <p>Scientists now know of a whole family of GPCRs that detect hundreds of different substances in and around the body. Work on the receptors has underpinned decades of progress in medicine, with half of all pharmaceuticals acting on the proteins.</p> <p>The huge variety of GPCRs allows individual organs in the body to react in different ways to the same stimulant. A surge of adrenaline through the body, for example, acts through GPCRs to make the heart race, the lungs heave, muscles contract and pupils widen. Without GPCRs, humans would not have the famous \"fight-or-flight\" response that is crucial for survival.</p> <p>Speaking by phone to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences soon after the announcement, Lefkowitz recalled the moment he heard of the award.</p> <p>\"I was fast asleep and the phone rang but I didn't hear it,\" he said. \"I wear ear plugs and my wife gave me an elbow and said there's a call for you. And there it was, a total shock and surprise, as many before me have experienced.\"</p> <p>Asked about his plans for the day, he said: \"I was going to get a haircut, which if you could see me you would see it is quite a necessity, but I'm afraid that will probably have to be postponed.\"</p> <p>In a statement from Stanford University, Kobilka said: \"I didn't believe it at first, but after I spoke with about five people \u2013 they handed the phone around \u2013 with really convincing Swedish accents, I started to think it was for real.\"</p> <p>For many years, researchers knew that adrenaline and other substances produced their effects without entering cells, suggesting they must instead act through surface sensors on the outsides of cells. Lefkowitz and Kobilka confirmed those suspicions and showed how the sensors worked.</p> <p>In the first step forward, in 1968, Lefkowitz used radioactive iodine to tag various hormones and track them in the body. Through these studies, he identified several GPCRs, including the one that responds specifically to adrenaline. His lab went on to isolate the receptor and unravel how it worked.</p> <p>The next major advance came in the 1980s when, working in Lefkowitz's lab, Kobilka discovered the gene that makes the adrenaline receptor. On inspecting the DNA sequence, the scientists noticed its similarities to another gene responsible for a light-sensitive receptor in the eye. It dawned on them that there is a family GPCRs, all closely related and working in a similar way.</p> <p>\"Their real triumph very early on was to show that you could isolate these sensors and what they sensed. And what they sense is actually quite staggering,\" said <a href=\"http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/Governance/RSCCouncil/CouncilMembersBiography/DPhillipsBio.asp\" title=\"David Phillips\">David Phillips</a>, former president of the Royal Society of Chemistry.</p> <p>\"These are important in everyday life. They are important for our continued existence. Certainly in primitive mankind if you didn't have this fight-or-flight response we would not have survived danger,\" Phillips added.</p> <p>There are nearly a thousand known GPCRs in the human body, but scientists do not understand what substances or stimuli trigger all of them. Some of those that are understood respond to light, flavour, smell, adrenaline and histamine, which is important in allergic reactions, and dopamine, which is used in treating Parkinson's disease.</p> <p>This year, in line with other recent years, the Nobel prize honoured research that is more in the biological sciences than in the realm of classical chemistry. But the apparent shift away from more traditional chemistry was not a cause for concern, Phillips said.</p> <p>\"The field of chemical biology is burgeoning because at its heart, at the heart of certainly cell biology, is an understanding at the molecular level of what's going on and that's chemistry essentially. So other sorts of chemistry are still going on and still very important, but this level of understanding, which has been made possible by advances in techniques over the last 20 years or so, is crucial to mankind.\"</p>",
  "<p>Oil-rich countries like Scotland have a \"moral obligation\" to invest in green energy, Alex Salmond said on Wednesday as he insisted his government would not cut oil production.</p> <p>The first minister was responding to accusations by climate scientists and environmentalists that he was guilty of \"indefensible\" energy policies after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/09/scotland-energy-policies-attacked\" title=\"\">a Guardian analysis found</a> that his oil and gas strategies could release 10bn tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere.</p> <p>In a keynote address on Wednesday to <a href=\"http://www.slciconference.com/\" title=\"\">a conference on low-carbon technologies</a>, Salmond said there was no contradiction between pursuing \"world leading\" targets on renewable power, to produce 100% of Scotland's electricity from renewable sources, while maximising oil and gas production.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/news/2012/05/new-oil-and-gas-strategy-for-scotland.aspx\" title=\"\">His government predicts</a> that 24bn barrels of North Sea oil, worth some \u00a31.5 trillion, can be produced over the next 40 years. Many senior climate scientists, such as James Hansen from Nasa, and Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall centre in Manchester, believe the world is already close to the tipping point for significant global warming.</p> <p>He said Scotland's expertise in North Sea oil and exploration in deep waters, gave it a \"huge competitive advantage\" in the global marine energy industry. He told the conference that a \u00a3103m Scottish low-carbon investment fund, to support marine energy and community heating schemes, had now opened.</p> <p>\"It's not just an economic opportunity, it's a moral imperative that hydrocarbon countries lead the way in renewable energy technologies,\" he said.</p> <p>The first minister is facing a rebellion by a coalition of 60 Scottish environment groups, global development charities and churches after Scotland's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions rose in 2010, breaching his government's first annual emissions reduction target. After several years supporting Salmond's policies, the <a href=\"http://www.stopclimatechaos.org/getyouracttogether\" title=\"\">Stop Climate Chaos Scotland coalition</a> will lobby MSPs at Holyrood later this month urging the first minister to \"get your act together\".</p> <p>They believe Salmond lacks the political courage to tackle rising transport and heating emissions, instead building more roads, backing aviation and cancelling rail schemes. Opencast coal mining has also increased sharply under his government: there are now 32m tonnes of coal approved for extraction.</p> <p>Tom Ballantine, chairman of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, said the government's commitments on climate were encouraging but campaigners could not ignore the \"massive contradictions\" in its energy policies.</p> <p>\"A government that is serious about moving to a low-carbon economy and reducing Scotland's emissions cannot be promoting \u2013 and should not be using public funds to prop up \u2013 the oil and gas industry. Nor can it continue its relentless focus on building new roads, which will create even more emissions,\" he said.</p> <p>Salmond acknowledged that Al Gore, the former US vice-president and climate campaigner, was right to warn about the present impacts of climate change on the world, from wildfires, droughts, violent storms and crop failures.</p> <p>That added to the \"moral imperative\" for oil-rich nations to produce low-carbon alternatives.</p> <p>\"Climate change is not a distant ungraspable threat. It's not something that's going to happen to our children and to their children. It's something that is already happening and its effects are already being felt,\" Salmond said.</p> <p>\"In the developed world, these effects are felt by deep disruption, inconvenience and substantial economic costs. In the developing world, the effects for example on the change of weather patterns on the Horn of Africa, are catastrophic.\"</p> <p>The UN Development Programme <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/02/environment-human-un\" title=\"\">said last year that climate change would severely hit the world's poorest countries</a>: \"In the context of that global threat development low-carbon technologies can't just be seen as an economic opportunity, it's also that moral imperative,\" Salmond said.</p> <p>He told the Guardian he had never heard any climate scientist state that the world should stop or reduce production of oil, gas and coal. \"That would have a very significant further dislocation of the world economy at the moment,\" he said.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Hansen, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/06/nasa-scientist-climate-change\" title=\"\">the pioneering Nasa climate scientist,</a> urged immediate and deep cuts in fossil fuel use, and a global carbon tax, when he accepted the Edinburgh medal for his contribution to science.</p> <p>Hansen said at the time: \"We can't simply say that there's a climate problem, and leave it to the politicians. They're so clearly under the influence of the fossil fuel industry that they're coming up with cockamamie solutions which aren't solutions. That is the bottom line.\"</p> <p>Salmond said he was \"extremely confident\" that Scotland would meet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/24/scotland-climate-change-bill\" title=\"\">its 42% emissions cut target by 2020</a> and attributed the 2010 figuresto temporary fluctuations in energy use.</p> <p>Scotland already generates 35% of its electricity needs from renewables, and his ministers were now investing in hydrogen and hybrid vehicles, Salmond said, but he admitted his government had failed to tackle transport emissions.</p> <p>\"Transportation has certainly been an area where Scotland has to do more as indeed is heating, but I don't think anyone would seriously dispute that in terms of electricity production then our commitment and our success in low-carbon and renewable generation has been one of the most important in the world,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Power, as everyone knows, abhors a vacuum, and there is a whopping big one in Birmingham this week. That it is filled by Boris Johnson comes as no surprise to anyone \u2013 but he could park a London bus in it, so huge is the gaping hole where you would expect to find a frontbench team. It really is the strangest thing \u2013 a four-day conference held by an invisible government \u2013 like a party whose own hosts fail to show.</p> <p>Normally you would see cabinet ministers everywhere, flanked by aides in busy little clusters of self-importance, striding about from fringe meetings to&#xa0;media parties, occasionally even mingling with party members. Not this week. The fringe speakers are mostly backbenchers or junior ministers you have never heard of \u2013 and that's if you are lucky; quite often it is just their private parliamentary secretary. The only senior figure much in evidence is Ken Clarke \u2013 but given that everyone knows David Cameron can't&#xa0;control him, his ubiquity merely amplifies the suspicion of a three-line whip ordering frontbenchers to keep their heads down.</p> <p>Equally conspicuous by their absence are the beautiful people. For some City bankers and Knightsbridge ladies who lunch, the Tory party conference is a social fixture of the season, and they can usually be spotted around the hotel bars, expensively dressed and aggressively groomed, lending a certain glamour to proceedings. Two years ago, they were everywhere \u2013 but here, in the mid-term doldrums, they have vanished, leaving only the party's hardcore of policy wonks, ideologues and true believers.</p> <p>Every party looks slightly scary when reduced to its rump, and in the Tories' case the look is particularly alarming. There are the angular, curiously pointy young men in three-piece suits, with staring eyes and towering foreheads, and chins that either jut out abruptly or do not appear to exist. There are alice-band girls in pearls with horsey laughs, bald middle-aged dandies in pinstripe, and the pensioners in blazers with features permanently fixed into expressions of sharp suspicion. These are the party's loyal, true-blue members \u2013 and they are emphatically not modernisers.</p> <p>Those who had wanted to believe in modernisation seem to be struggling to remember why they had ever bought into it. A middle-aged pair from the Midlands don't want to sound disloyal, but can't hide their disappointment. \"Why are we sending aid to India when&#xa0;they've got more money than us?\" puzzles the woman. The man is bewildered by gay marriage.</p> <p>\"I don't know why they are so obsessed about something that affects so few of our voters. Why are we worried about it?\" He shakes his head. \"I look around me at people who are Conservative voters. They are deeply religious, and we are attacking the basis of that. They live in the green belt; we are kicking the green belt. I look at one thing after another and I think: how is this going to bring out the grassroots voters at the election? We need a return to Conservative values.\"</p> <p>\"I don't think David Cameron is a proper Tory,\" she agrees. \"To be honest, if I was given the choice I would want William Hague back.\"</p> <p>\"All I would say,\" he offers glumly, \"is&#xa0;definitely not George Osborne. And I would not have said that two years ago.\"</p> <p>The hall is less than full and ominously stony when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-shares-rights-scheme\" title=\"\">Osborne delivers his speech</a>. Like a once-promising employee summoned to explain a disastrous performance, the chancellor is heard out more in sorrow than in anger, by rows of unsmiling faces dark with doubt and disapproval. They know he has no excuse; the applause is dutiful, the chemistry dead. Osborne's speech doesn't end with a standing ovation so much as people half clapping as they stand and head straight for the&#xa0;exits.</p> <p>It's a very different story at an Adam Smith Institute fringe meeting on economic growth later that afternoon. It's not just standing room only \u2013 people can't even squeeze into the room \u2013 but still they hover at the door, hungry for the narcotic blast of high-grade, free-market rhetorical cocaine. \"Remember: low taxes and low spending. If you just remember that,\" urges a speaker, \"a lot of our difficulties will be removed.\" The chair despairs of Osborne's warning that morning to people who don't pay their taxes (\"Why is tax avoidance a priority?\"). The mantra is&#xa0;relentless: cut taxes, cut spending, roll back the state.</p> <p>Only a few years ago this sort of session had been exiled to the fringes of the fringe, confined to diehard followers of John Redwood, but now meetings such as this dominate the week, like a runaway Thatcherite express train hurtling back to the&#xa0;80s.</p> <p>Every party conference can become a bit of a parallel universe, safe behind its G4S security cordon, but this takes the bubble mentality to a whole new level. In the real world outside, austerity is hurting and voters are complaining about cuts, but here inside most people put the government's problems down to being too wet and leftwing. A <a href=\"http://www.populus.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Populus</a> fringe meeting delivers an avalanche of bad news about the party's poll ratings, but to a&#xa0;half-empty room; in previous years, when the polling news was good, the Populus meeting was always well attended. Now the party doesn't seem keen to hear what voters think of them.</p> <p>Ann Widdecombe's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/08/archbishop-canterbury-gay-marriage-tory\" title=\"\">anti-gay marriage rally</a>, on the other hand, is packed and excitable to the point of pantomime, with Widdecombe on her feet conducting the audience from the stage. \"Is that how we want our country to look?\" she&#xa0;trills. \"No!\" everyone roars. \"This is not an anti-gay rally, it is defining marriage full stop!\" she shrieks. \"Yes!\"&#xa0;everyone cheers.</p> <p>Afterwards, I speak to a very tall, incredibly gentle elderly man from London, and ask why he thinks Cameron is so determined to force this&#xa0;unpopular policy on his party. \"I&#xa0;really don't know,\" he ponders softly, bemused. \"But the Tory party is obsessed with trying to be modern. It&#xa0;goes in a sort of sequence: to start off, you mustn't be prejudiced against BME [black and minority ethnic] people. Then women. Then it leads to the homosexuals. But you can't help being BME or a woman. Whether or not you can help being born with a homosexual orientation I don't know, but it <em>is</em> possible to refrain from practising. To be honest, I'm more or less bisexual myself. I find women attractive but men easier to get on with. I've never married. But I abstain. It is possible, you know.\"</p> <p>He joined the Young Conservatives in 1953, but if the policy goes through he will resign. \"I'm just not sure that David Cameron is a true Tory,\" he reflects sadly. \"The Old Etonian guard tend to be more leftwing than the people like David Davis who came up the hard way. Personally, I'd have Michael Gove as prime minister, with David Willetts as chancellor.\" Does he think his party will win the next election? \"Oh no, dear,\" and he gently shakes his head. \"I&#xa0;think we won't.\"</p> <p><em>Everyone</em> I meet thinks the party will lose the next election. The only person who keeps insisting they'll win is Boris \u2013 who everyone knows must be hoping they won't, so I'm not sure that his prediction counts. But then everything about Boris assumes a fantastical quality this week. Queues for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/08/boris-johnson-conservative-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">his rally</a> begin more than an hour before the doors open, and the hall erupts into rock-concert cheers at the mere sight of his face on a warm up video. (The film is promoting international aid; Louise Mensch's face comes up next, and is loudly booed and hissed; Andrew Mitchell's provokes hearty if&#xa0;ironic hoots.) A young Spectator reporter arrives in a tizz, breathless from the heady thrill of mere proximity to the media scrum outside mobbing Boris. We're shown a video of Boris stunt riding a bike down the steps of Trafalgar Square to a spoof James Bond&#xa0;soundtrack, the words \"Mission: Imborisable\" appear on the screen, and on to the stage bounds the mayor to a delirious standing ovation.</p> <p>He says nothing whatsoever of consequence, and nobody cares; soppy grins are glazed across adoring faces, mesmerised by the mere fact of him. At&#xa0;the end, it's time for questions and, for a few extraordinary moments (this <em>never</em> happens at party conference), not one hand goes up. It's partly down to starstruck awe, I think \u2013 but more to the fact that answers are not the point of Boris. Fans didn't mob the Beatles to&#xa0;hear Paul McCartney's views on deficit reduction.</p> <p>When Boris <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/09/boris-johnson-top-rate-tax\" title=\"\">addresses the main conference the following morning</a>, he&#xa0;sends a frisson through the crowd every time he teases Cameron. Far from posing a threat, I begin to see that he actually functions as a rather useful safety valve, giving dissatisfied Tories the vicarious thrill of dissent so that no&#xa0;one feels the need to mutiny. \"Isn't he marvellous?\" beaming members swoon when it's over. \"We just <em>adore</em> Boris.\" But I don't find anyone who actually wants him to lead the party. \"Er, well, um, no,\" they all say, the smiles fading. \"Not leader, no,\" says one. \"I don't think that would really suit him. He needs to be his own man, that's why we love him so much.\" \"Yes, <em>we</em> love him,\" another agrees. \"I'm just not sure the rest of the world would quite get him. If I picture him at a G8 or&#xa0;something, I don't really see how that could work.\"</p> <p>For all the Borismania headlines of the week, the really important political developments take place far away from the spotlight, in fringe meetings dominated by a new book called Britannia Unchained. Published by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\" title=\"\">a new rightwing parliamentary faction</a>, the Free Enterprise Group, it calls for neo-Thatcherite free-market liberalisation on a scale that would probably make the Iron Lady blush. Rejecting the European economic model, it invokes global competition from the east to justify what critics call a new right manifesto to turn the UK into South Korea, replacing the welfare state with ruthless Tiger Moms and 90-hour weeks \u2013 but it is clearly being taken very seriously in Downing Street.</p> <p>No 10 didn't want any ministers saying anything too radically rightwing this week in case it upset their Lib Dem partners, hence their absence from the fringe. The ministerial injunction led to the weird impression of an invisible government \u2013 but it created a convenient vacancy for a new generation of MPs to&#xa0;begin the ideological heavy lifting required to move the party to the right.</p> <p>\"We see the chancellor a lot,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2012/sep/17/kwasi-kwarteng-work-opt-out-culture-video\" title=\"\">Kwasi Kwarteng MP</a>, one of the book's co-authors, tells me. \"He knows what we are saying. He gets it. It's very tempting in a democracy for everyone to congregate around the status quo\" \u2013 the centre ground \u2013 \"so it's quite useful for a Tory chancellor to have people like us saying: 'No, this is actually what we want to see.' He is very interested in us. We can push the debate in ways he feels too constrained to do.\"</p> <p>I don't think he is boasting. In Osborne's speech there is a revealing line \u2013 \"Western democracies like ours are being out-worked \u2013 are we going to sink or swim? Some western economies won't catch up\" \u2013 and when Cameron delivers the closing speech of the conference, there it is again: \"We are in a global race today. Sink or swim. Do or decline.\" Cameron's repeated references to \"hard work\" echo the words of another Britannia Unchained co-author, Dominic Raab MP, whose relentless message this week is \"hard graft\".</p> <p>As the party pours out of the hall and heads off home, there is the traditional post-leader's speech elation among the membership, and everyone is happy. For the first time all week, people tell me they think they can win in 2015. \"Inspirational\" \"Magnificent.\" \"Amazing.\" Everyone mentions Cameron's defence of welfare cuts as a highlight, and when I run into the woman I'd met from the Midlands earlier in the week, she agrees, \"I thought it was a really good speech. He picked up key Tory issues like welfare.\" Then she frowns, and adds, \"These things are easy to say, but will he deliver on them?\"</p> <p>Philip Blond, founder of the centrist thinktank ResPublica and author of Red Tory, looks less impressed. \"It was a Thatcherite speech to a Thatcherite party, so it secured his base. But I don't think it spoke to the country.\"</p> <p>Very little is left now of the Cameroon modernisation project except gay rights; even the party's logo, once an eco-friendly green tree, has been rebranded in red, white and blue to resemble a union flag. I don't find a single member who supports gay marriage, but I ask the man I meet at the anti-gay marriage rally if he can't at least see its value as&#xa0;the last surviving signifier of the party's detoxification.</p> <p>\"Oh no,\" he blinks in surprise. \"Oh no, I'm all in favour of re-toxifying the brand. In fact, I nearly got someone to&#xa0;make me a badge saying The&#xa0;Nasty&#xa0;Party.\"</p> <p>If the Tories keep heading to the right at this rate, by next year he shouldn't need to.</p>",

  "<p>The relentless march of technology is perhaps the best highlight of the blocks and opportunities to creating a more sustainable future.</p> <p>I was reminded of this following a visit to New York's <a href=\"http://www.newmuseum.org/\" title=\"\">New Museum</a> and the <a href=\"http://sxsweco.com/\" title=\"\">SXSW Eco</a> conference in Austin, Texas last week.</p> <p>The New Museum is holding an exhibition called Ghosts in the Machine, which includes artists, writers, and visionaries whose works have explored the fears and aspirations generated by the technology of their time.</p> <p>The recreation of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Vanderbeek\" title=\"\">Stan VanDerBeek's Movie-Drome</a> (1963\u201366), is an illustration of how technology can be a negative force.</p> <p>Lying down inside a large sphere, one is bombarded by a stream of moving images and a cacophony of sounds, ranging from fighting robots, screaming children, naked women, Nazi storm troopers and astronauts in space.</p> <p>Stumbling out into the sombre quiet of the main exhibition space feels like escaping madness itself.</p> <p>It's a great illustration of how the rise of global communications and the Internet is pumping out a torrent of information that often leads to mis-information, confusion and exhaustion.</p> <p>That's only part of the story. More important is how advances in technology have largely been responsible for creating our unsustainable, globalised economy and a consumerist and agricultural monoculture.</p> <p>Dr Vandana Shiva <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/vandana-shiva-corporate-monopoly-seeds\" title=\"\">wrote this week</a> for Guardian Sustainable Business, accusing large corporations of creating \"seed slavery\" via genetic engineering and patents.</p> <p>At the SXSW Eco conference , there were other examples highlighted. The American environmentalist and author <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/mckibben-bill\" title=\"\">Bill McKibben</a>, talked of how the development of natural gas fracking is virtually killing the market for renewable energy in the US by undercutting its business model.</p> <p>\"It is clear at this point that fracking cheap gas is not the bridge to the future but pushing the rickety pier further into the carbon lake,\" he said.</p> <p>But as much as technology is making things difficult, it also offers some powerful solutions for sustainability. One example highlighted at SXSW Eco is how the Internet is facilitating small scale food producers, distributors and retailers to develop more effective joint networks.</p> <p>Technological developments are also leading to innovations across business, such as Nike's waterless dyeing system. One focus at SXSW Eco was of a growing awareness of the importance of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/guardian-live-discussion-biomimicry-sustainable-green-design\" title=\"\">biomimicry</a>, which examines nature, its models, systems, processes, and elements, to emulate or take inspiration from in order to solve problems.</p> <p>Lance Hosey, chief sustainability officer of architectural practice <a href=\"http://www.rtkl.com/\" title=\"\">RTKL</a> talked, for example, of how scientists are studying anthills in Africa that are able to maintain the same temperature inside, regardless of whether it is blazing hot or freezing cold.</p> <p>Ted Nordhaus, chairman of the <a href=\"http://thebreakthrough.org/\" title=\"\">Breakthrough Institute</a>, is a particular advocate for the power of technology to save us from ourselves. He said: \"There are profound questions as to how are we going to preserve some parts of our natural heritage and keep changes in planetary temperature within a certain range.</p> <p>\"The only way you do that is by building, brick by brick, an entirely new energy and agricultural economy. Technology is the solution, not the problem. There is no path through without radical technological innovation.\"</p> <p>Economist Diane Coyle, author of the <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9402.html\" title=\"\">Economics of Enough</a>, is another believer that technology holds the key, but she is concerned that it could also further embed power in the hands of small elites.</p> <p>In an interview for the Guardian Sustainable Businesses' Enough is not Enough video series, which will air on the site in the coming weeks, she says: \"Think about mobile phones which seemed like yuppie toys when they first emerged but actually are absolutely transformative in developing economies. So technology, that kind of innovation that comes with technology is the force for good.</p> <p>\"I also think the risks are about power and inequality \u2026 That's a battle that is currently being played out and I wouldn't want to predict what the outcome of that is going to be. Because we are in an economy with lots of concentrated power, the economic elites are extraordinarily powerful. Just look at how little banking and financial reform there has been given a crisis on this scale, I find it absolutely extraordinary but that's a measure of embedded power in the economy and technology could embed that even further.\"</p> <p>Given its dualistic nature, what can be done to maximise technology's benefits, while also minimising its risks?</p> <p>A number of speakers at SXSW Eco talked of the importance of citizens combining to hold corporations and regulators to account to prevent technology getting out of control.</p> <p>McKibben talked about how the Internet had facilitated the expansion of <a href=\"http://www.350.org/\" title=\"\">350.org</a>, the global movement to tackle climate change he co-founded, now present all over the world despite having a tiny core team.</p> <p>Food activist and best selling author <a href=\"http://smallplanet.org/about/anna/bio\" title=\"\">Anna Lappe</a> said large companies could not be expected to take the lead because they are so embedded in the current economic system of profit maximisation.</p> <p>She told me: \"The only way is to look at what has been successful in the past, which is for people to come together to organise for change and to force corporations to do the right thing by calling them to account.\"</p> <p>She gives the example of the success in stopping regulators in the US from allowing irradiated food and crops grown with the aid of sewage sludge from being included in the organic certification standard.</p> <p>Annie Leonard, co-director of the <a href=\"http://www.storyofstuff.org/\" title=\"\">Story of Stuff Project</a>, spoke of how there needs to be a move away from consumer action to citizen action, suggesting that people had focussed too much on trying to change their own personal habits, rather than the system.</p> <p>While holding power to account is an important component of ensuring technology does not become a destructive force, companies also have a responsibility for ensuring they do not overstep the mark.</p> <p>I recently interviewed the co-chairman of <a href=\"http://www.infosys.com/pages/index.aspx\" title=\"\">Infosys</a>, Senapathy Gopalakrishnan, and he talked of the importance of focussing not only on the benefits of technology, but also their unintended consequences.</p> <p>Gopalakrishnan says that while technology can benefit all of our lives, it also has the capacity to create harm. He gives the crude example that electricity can light up our lives and also kill us.</p> <p>\"It is human beings who decide how to leverage technology and where to put limits,\" he says. \"So it is important we understand the power and benefits as well as the problems technology can create.</p> <p>\"If you look at the challenges facing humanity today such as climate change and poverty and water scarcity, they all need answers from using technology, but we have to be very careful we look at any unintended consequences. We have to control technology rather than letting technology control us.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Social enterprises have been urged to keep the momentum going on social impact reporting, particularly because traditional businesses are moving into recording their own social impact, and might prove to be competition.</p> <p>Speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.clearlyso.com/event/51/ClearlySo%20Social%20Business%20Conference%202012\" title=\"\">ClearlySo Social Business Conference 2012</a>, Clara Barby, head of impact at social investment company <a href=\"http://www.bridgesventures.com/\" title=\"\">Bridges Ventures</a>, said: \"Just because reporting is still not standardised, don't see it as too much of a headache; it's the most important thing we can all do together.\"</p> <p>Addressing a room of 150 people, she said: \"We're seeing more bleed between social enterprises and traditional businesses. If a business can prove it's more cost effective [in creating social change] than its peers, that's the gold star.\"</p> <p>As a social investor, she said it was important to be able to compare social impact between companies. \"Bridges has commercial funds too, where we feel impact and commercial returns go together. Asset owners increasingly ask 'am I getting as much impact here for my pound?'</p> <p>\"As sectors become more crowded, this will become the key differentiator. If we can actually calculate the cost of job creation between different companies, for example, it means we can allocate funding so much better. And in a world short of resource, that's exciting.\"</p> <p>Barby encouraged social enterprises not to write off impact measurement as being too complicated. \"Think how long it took for the accounting industry to standardise. We're still at early stage with social impact accounting. Don't just think it seems too unwieldy and complicated, we need to do it,\" she said.</p> <p>Even though social enterprises and society in general might not be able to ever fully agree on matters of social value, that doesn't mean that efforts to standardise as many indicators as possible shouldn't continue, said the investor.</p> <p>She said social enterprises needed to get involved with shaping existing and emerging tools for reporting. She referred to <a href=\"http://iris.thegiin.org/\" title=\"\">IRIS</a>, the global impact investing network that is trying to create a 'dictionary' of definitions that could be used in social impact reporting and talked about <a href=\"http://giirs.org/\" title=\"\">GIIRS \u2013 the Global Impact Investing Rating System</a>.</p> <p>Barby commented: \"The impact investment world wants something of a credit rating for businesses.

  "<p>Some of the biggest international clothing brands and retailers have been criticised by a group of Chinese NGOs because of the pollution caused by textile producers that are claimed to be suppliers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ipe.org.cn/en/about/notice_de.aspx?id=10859\" title=\"\">A report published</a> by the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPEA), Friends of Nature, Green Beagle, Envirofriends and Nanjing Green Stone highlights what the NGOs claim are deficiencies in the environmental management of supply chains in China. The report says that a number of textile manufacturers that allegedly supply material for the production of clothes for large brands and retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer, Disney, Polo Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger have been found to be carrying out polluting practices.</p> <p>The director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, Ma Jun, said the report found that many major brands which claim to have sustainable practices \"have not extended their management to the material suppliers. Some of them don't know at all who the suppliers or finishers are and therefore there is no environmental management to this process.\"</p> <p>He said that many of the suppliers violate waste water discharge standards and \"some dump the water without adequate treatment or even without treatment and others have air emission issues\". He added: \"Some of the pollution is damaging to local environments, rivers and lakes and some impact on the livelihoods of local communities.\"</p> <p>According to the report, much of the garment-making industry has moved out of China due to a number of factors, including rising costs, to other countries in south-east Asia and Africa. The industry that remains in China is the dyeing and finishing sector which is resource-intensive and often polluting.</p> <p>M&amp;S is among a group of companies highlighted in the report, that lists a number of textile suppliers the NGOs claim make material for these companies and their alleged environmental violations. Ma said: \"We don't know even if they know who these suppliers are and we don't know whether they have been doing some sort of checks with any of them.\"</p> <p>\"During our research, we identified some of their [M&amp;S's] suppliers as having made very serious pollution discharges causing an impact on the environment and local communities,\" he added.</p> <p>However, a spokesperson for M&amp;S said: \"We have concerns about the accuracy of the report and are disappointed not to have been given the opportunity to discuss it with IPEA and correct the numerous inaccuracies. We take the eco and ethical performance of our supply chain very seriously and have already started a thorough investigation. As a condition of doing business with our suppliers, all dye houses that supply our suppliers must adhere to our strict environmental standards.\"</p> <p>Ma said if consumers understood the true costs, he thought they would no longer want products created through polluting and damaging processes. \"Consumers enjoy all the great variety of fashion products with decreasing costs but in the meantime I hope that they understand that this is not all coming out of the blue, manufacturing of these products are still causing problems in China and other countries,\" he said.</p> <p>Disney, Polo Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger were contacted but did not respond.</p>",
  "<p>Following a summer of dramatic increases in international and UK food prices, the third spike since 2008, it is becoming clear the dynamics of the international food system are changing \u2013 and not for the better. With <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTPOVERTY/Resources/336991-1311966520397/Food-Price-Watch-August-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">increases of 10% on international food markets</a>, and domestic staples up by as much as 113% in some countries, it is time to focus on what needs to happen next.</p> <p>Research by Save the Children, due to be published next week, will highlight that we are facing a \"new normal\" of high and volatile food prices. The stakes are high. The countries with the highest burden of undernutrition, responsible for as many as 2.6m child deaths a year, are the most exposed to food price spikes. They tend to be net importers of food, and have citizens who spend 30-60% of their income on food.</p> <p>When prices go up, poor people take their children out of school and prioritise foods that provide energy over nutrition. A relatively short spike can have long-term effects on the development and potential of children.</p> <p>In the face of these changes, the G20 established the agricultural markets information system (Amis) last year to monitor and respond to food price volatility. Last month, <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5E8KHNPC20120917?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0\" title=\"\">France called for a meeting of Amis's rapid response forum</a>, a request swiftly rejected by the US as being unnecessary. This kind of complacency could be disastrous if it fails to curb panicked policy responses. In 2010, an export ban imposed by Russia sent international food prices spiralling, while having limited impact on calming price rises in the country.</p> <p>Russia has already <a href=\"http://www.agriculture.com/markets/analysis/wheat/russia-no-b-on-grain-expts_11-ar26136\" title=\"\">rejected reports</a> it would impose a grain export ban. Yet conversations in the corridors of agriculture ministries and trading floors suggest more subtle measures may be afoot, such as using government control of the national railway to slow exports. In 2010, the Kremlin denied export restrictions only three hours before <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/rr-impact-russias-grain-export-ban-280611-en.pdf\" title=\"\">Vladimir Putin, then the prime minister, announced an export ban</a>.</p> <p>If the international community is serious about dealing with this problem, it needs to address the fundamentals. Investment in agriculture has been declining year on year in Africa. This pattern needs to change and will involve more investment from donors, and developing countries improving their ability to collect taxes \u2013 measures should be taken against companies undermining these efforts by dodging taxes.</p> <p>Scaling up resources is not enough. The governance of the international food system needs a step change. EU and US biofuel mandates, which demand that a proportion of the fuel they use comes from renewable sources, have been criticised. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), NGOs and, most recently, the chief executive of agriculture firm Cargill say food insecurity is being exacerbated by shifting massive tracts of land from food to fuel production. In the face of persistent food insecurity, the subsidies for this should be swiftly revised.</p> <p>Transparency and improved governance of large-scale land acquisition is also critical. Oxfam <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/04/land-deals-preventing-food-production\" title=\"\">reported last week</a> that huge areas of land are being leased or sold every six days, with nearly a third of Liberia swallowed up by land deals in just five years. Not all land deals are bad, of course, but without appropriate governance, these can undermine the food security of local communities in developing countries.</p> <p>Investing in food stocks is part of the long-term solution to volatility. Every food price spike since world war two has coincided with low stock levels. Yet this investment is expensive and would need to occur over a long period to avoid hoarding pushing up prices at a time when supplies are limited.</p> <p>Agriculture ministers are due to meet in Rome on 16 October, World Food Day. They must remember that although the politics may be difficult, the stakes are high for the world's poorest people. They must set out a road map to respond to this crisis and act urgently to address the drivers of volatility \u2013 not just respond when crises hit.</p>",
  "<p>With major agency acquisitions such as that of AKQA by WPP, LBi by Publicis Groupe and <a href=\"http://www.adamandeveddb.com/\">Adam &amp; Eve by Omnicom's DDB Worldwide</a> hitting the headlines over recent months, many smaller agencies will again be questioning how they can keep pace with the tactics of their global competitors. The good news is that the current landscape offers some very good opportunities for smaller agencies that are able to demonstrate agility and an entrepreneurial spirit.</p> <p>The run of recent large agency acquisitions is testament to the increasing client demand for agencies to provide an integrated service. The key piece of territory everyone is seeking is, of course, digital.</p> <p>Digital is fast becoming a core skill set and not a niche add-on and there is an opportunity for small agencies to position themselves as integrated experts by enhancing their digital offering. Recognising this, many agencies have already begun to invest in the digital side of their business.</p> <p>However, there is no one-size fits all formula for success. While the big agencies can pursue acquisition strategies to plug their skills gap, for smaller agencies the most viable and least risky answer often lies in a strategy of organic expansion. </p> <p>While some firms choose to up-skill existing staff or to hire skills on a freelance or contract basis, it is also worth considering investing for the long-term in digital development by recruiting new employees who can work in an offline and an online environment. This latter option might require more financial commitment, but as digital is not something likely to lose its appeal to clients anytime soon, this type of longer-term strategy will ensure smaller agencies can meet the demands both of current and future clients.</p> <p>Growing your staff base can be an expensive undertaking, however, especially as new digitally-focused recruits often command high salaries that reflect their experience and its worth to the firm. For agencies based in London, this is an overhead that is exacerbated by paying London rents and salaries. </p> <p>A cost effective alternative would be to set up a satellite digital agency outside the capital. This could mean investing in a new regional office, or it could be as simple as employing someone who works from home. The considerations when adopting this approach are around culture integration and ensuring that any home or remote workers are fully aligned with the rest of the team in delivery of work.</p> <p>Whichever strategy a small agency takes, the expansion into new digital services can certainly help open up new opportunities. But as with any growth, a change of business structure can bring its own risks and agencies should plan and prepare for this adequately. For example, it is vital that the agency is able to maintain cash flow in order to meet obligations to both staff and suppliers.</p> <p>By articulating early on what this growth strategy looks like with the agency's financial partner, it's possible to ensure the right financial support is in place to safeguard existing assets and grow successfully.</p> <p>While acquiring another agency might not be a viable option for many smaller agencies, if they follow a canny growth strategy they may find themselves an attractive prospect for acquisition bids from bigger agencies. This could even come at an earlier stage in the agency's lifecycle than was previously expected, as we saw with Adam &amp; Eve's acquisition by Omnicom's DDB Worldwide. For the acquiring company the obvious benefit is filling a skills gap quickly with an established business which has its own staff base, clients and reputation. For the acquired it can be a weighty price tag.</p> <p>Another opportunity open to smaller agencies at the moment is the increase in available project work. On the back of shrinking marketing budgets many brands are reducing their agency retainers and choosing to work more on a project basis \u2013 some brands are even moving away from retainers completely. This means that agile, smaller players offering cost-effective project solutions can compete for business against retained partners and bigger agencies, adding big brand names to their client rosters. Having a strong integrated offering will be extremely useful in this respect.</p> <p>Despite the harsh economic climate and the fact that bigger, global players are reinforcing their position with major acquisitions, there are some very good opportunities out there for smaller marketing agencies. The key is balancing the right growth strategy and entrepreneurial spirit with a robust, yet flexible financial plan. Swift levels of expansion and rapid growth can quickly render an organisation's existing capital structure redundant, and without the right forward planning, agencies could in fact find themselves with reduced access to the levels of debt finance required to continue growing and take on bigger projects or more staff to service client accounts. Working with a trusted financial partner who understands the intricacies and shifting dynamics of the marketing industry can be invaluable to businesses looking to grow or adapt in the current climate.</p> <p>A good finance partner will understand a business' aspirations and be able to provide appropriate and guidance and advice to support that growth. The opportunities for growth are out there, agencies just need to determine the best path to make the most of them.</p> <p><em>Lorraine Ruckstuhl is Corporate Director of the Barclays TMT division</em></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>In the hours that followed the surreal role reversal in last week's presidential debate, liberal political scientists and statisticians rushed to the public square to insist that television scraps of the like rarely reorganize contests. Breathless and harried the lot of them, these number-crunchers&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/03/what-political-scientists-know-about-debates/\">swore the fundamentals of the race would remain</a>: President Barack Obama would preserve his lead in spite of challenger Mitt Romney's silver-tongued swipes.</p> <p>But the sobering truth is that debates are something more than shallow theater and can dramatically shape candidate perceptions. A spate of new surveys out this week found voter preferences have swung wildly in the days since Romney scored his debate upset, with the Republican jumping into the lead in&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\">Real Clear Politics' polling index</a>&#xa0;for the first time in the race.</p> <p>Gallup found 72% of debate watchers thought Romney won, a full 52-point spread between the challenger and incumbent.&#xa0;That's the <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/157907/romney-narrows-vote-gap-historic-debate-win.aspx\">single largest debate deficit ever recorded by the polling firm</a>, the previously largest margin won by Bill Clinton in George HW Bush's infamous \"wristwatch-checking\" performance.</p> <p>Pew likewise <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/10-8-12%20Political%20Release.pdf\">tracked a draw among registered voters</a>, though Romney had managed to build a 4-point lead over Obama when the sample was limited only to those respondents likely to vote in the November contest. Rasmussen's latest daily tracking also measured support evenly split between the two men, at 48%, down from a modest upswing for the president.</p> <p>But the state of play across the map is similarly promising for Republicans. Surveys of seven of the nine battleground states have been released in the period since last week's debate. In five of those seven, Romney leads the president and trails only within the margin of error in the remaining two. That's a distinctly winnable race.&#xa0;</p> <p>The salience of contemporary presidential debates is largely a function of a hyperactive media environment that elevates to parallel significance a fumbled joke with a fumbled economy or a declaration of war. The daily grind \u2013 the painful minutiae of a horse race in which reporters and aides obsess over minor stump missteps \u2013 don't drive the sentiment of ordinary voters. Stumbles of the pedestrian variety, like <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/08/mitt-romneys-birth-certificate-joke/261553/\">Romney's recent&#xa0;birth certificate jest</a>&#xa0;or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRV5Y1JCGRI\">Joe Biden's largely forgotten&#xa0;invitation to a wheel chair-bound man to stand</a>, don't inform voter views.</p> <p>Instead, it's the big moments: the historic wins and losses, the inability of an incumbent president to make a serious case for re-election. For Romney, who has been trailing the president in polling for much of the race, the implication of a debate-wrought surge cannot be overstated.</p> <p>The candidate who led in the national polling aggregate after the first debate has won the White House in every race since Jimmy Carter booted Gerald Ford. This same axiom later displaced the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0913958/\">Man from Plains</a> just four years later, even as he trailed Ronald Reagan by a modest one point in post-debate polling.</p> <p>For this operative, who <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/01/what-was-the-huntsman-campaigns-problem/251469/\">labored for much of the last 18 months</a>&#xa0;to ensure Romney never clinched the nomination, it was a bitter-sweet moment to watch as the Bay Stater lanced the president. I spent many a primary debate night working into the early morning hours, shuffling embarrassing Romney exchanges and news clips to anyone willing to hear the spin.</p> <p>It was of no consequence that my candidate, Jon Huntsman, didn't win, ever. What did matter was that Romney didn't.</p> <p>But last week was different. It was historic, and the polls overwhelmingly reflect it.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Disclosure notice: the principal of the author's firm, <a href=\"http://www.hynescommunications.com/about-us/\">Hynes Communications</a>, serves as an adviser to the Romney campaign, though he has no formal connection to the GOP effort</em><br></p>",
  "<p>The BAE/EADS deal would have created the world's largest defence, security and aerospace group with sales of \u00a360bn a year and a global workforce of 220,000.</p> <p>Britain's largest union, Unite, urged the UK government to strengthen its 'golden share' in BAE Systems by taking an active stake in the company to safeguard jobs and boost manufacturing.</p> <p>\"The highly skilled workforces of both companies are the beating heart of British manufacturing,\" said <strong>Ian Waddell</strong>, <strong>Unite national officer for aerospace and shipbuilding</strong>. \"A merger, with a jobs guarantee, would have created a strong new company that could have protected the UK's long-term interests.</p> <p>\"There was an industrial logic to the merger, but national and political interests proved to be the stumbling block. The UK government now needs to strengthen its 'golden share' and send a powerful message that it backs British manufacturing and BAE Systems.</p> <p>\"Short-termism cannot be allowed to govern BAE's future. BAE management in the past has made some crucial wrong decisions, such as selling its stake in Airbus in 2006. We need to ensure the company plans for the long term and that short-term investor pressure is balanced with employee representation on the board.</p> <p>\"BAE is a great British company. The government needs to follow the example of Germany and France where they pursue an active industrial policy and adopt an approach that safeguards the highly skilled jobs which are critical to our country's defence.\"</p> <p><strong>Chuka Umunna</strong>, the <strong>shadow business secretary</strong>, said: \"Ministers have abandoned the approach which Labour adopted in government which was designed to give certainty to prime contractors and supply chains. We need ministers to work strategically with the defence sector to support industrial capacity and secure employment.</p> <p>\"For this to happen, the government needs to adopt a proper defence industrial strategy, giving industry greater certainty over sovereign capabilities, ensuring programmes run to time and cost and professionalising procurement within the MOD.\"</p> <p><strong>Jim Murphy</strong>, the <strong>shadow defence secretary</strong>, said: \"Britain needs a defence industrial strategy now more than ever.</p> <p>\"Now that the answer to the future of UK defence manufacturing cannot be found in France and Germany it must lie in Britain and other established markets.</p> <p>\"Those Conservative MPs who were warning against the involvement of French and German governments must now demand a more active industrial strategy from the British government.</p> <p>\"There will be huge worry and uncertainty about the future of defence jobs, thousands of which have already been lost. Ministers must urgently convene talks with industry to develop a fresh defence industrial plan to give certainty to companies and workers.\"</p> <p><strong>Wyre &amp; Preston North MP</strong> <strong>Ben Wallace</strong>, who organised 45 fellow MPs to sign a joint letter to the prime minister seeking stronger safeguards in the deal, said: \"I am pleased that the reality has hit home with BAE senior management. While the CEO of EADS had all good intentions he was never going to be able to throw the yoke of French and German political interference off his back. As long as those two squabbling government shareholders were present the deal should never have been promoted. Leopards don't change their spots and it was clear to me from the outset that British jobs were at risk.</p> <p>\"The BAE board should now reflect long and hard at what their strategic error could mean for the company's future. If they have put at risk my constituents' jobs and fatally wounded the UK's jewel in the manufacturing crown, then they should consider their position. BAE and its workers is a world leader in aerospace. It has a great future and it does not deserve, through inconsistent and unrealistic strategy, to be put at risk by such leadership.\"</p> <p><strong>Zafar Khan</strong>, an <strong>analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</strong>, said: \"I would have thought that they would have gone for an extension [from the takeover regulators] but clearly Germany must have dug in their heels for them just to call it a day at this stage.</p> <p>\"I take this as very good news as I didn't think this was a very good deal. I think it should be a huge sigh of relief for EADS shareholders.\"</p> <p><strong>Etienne de Durand</strong>, of the <strong>IFRI thinktank</strong>, said: \"Given the overall context it does not surprise me this failed \u2013 it was always going to be a risky project. Franco-German relations were already difficult because on the big issue, notably management of the eurozone crisis, the two sides don't see eye to eye either on the timing or the substance.</p> <p>\"We see of course that it is Germany that has leadership on political and economic questions in Europe. France is in the pilot's cabin but it has not got its hand on the wheel. And that creates difficulties.</p> <p>\"The impression you get is that on neither side of the Rhine were politicians very happy with the EADS-BAE tie-up. It seemed to both sides as if they were being taken for a ride by the other.\"</p> <p><strong>Guy Anderson</strong>, <strong>senior analyst with IHS Jane's</strong>, said: \"There will almost certainly be greater pressure on BAE Systems than EADS to reveal a plan B strategy as soon as possible.</p> <p>\"BAE Systems is better placed than many of its contemporaries in terms of margins and global reach, but the EADS merger talks mean the company has put itself firmly out on the field in terms of merger discussions and strategic direction.</p> <p>\"Investors are unlikely to be satisfied with business as usual. The continuation of BAE Systems' strategy of divesting non-core assets appears likely, although circumstances may call for something greater than the low key approach taken so far.\"</p>",
  "<p>He's been called \"<a href=\"http://www.americanprogress.org/about/staff/romm-joseph/bio/\">America's fiercest climate blogger</a>.\" And as a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a former Clinton administration official on clean energy, and an MIT trained physicist, the subjects he covers are vast\u2014ranging from energy policy to the role of rhetoric in communications, as discussed in his new book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477452222?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poinofinqu-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=1477452222\"><em>Language Intelligence</em></a>. But there's been a <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2011/09/08/314629/polling-obama-climate-change-public-opinion/\">recurrent theme</a> over the years at Joe Romm's popular blog <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/issue/\">Climate Progress</a>\u2014the argument that political leaders, and perhaps most prominently President Obama, need to step up and explain to the public why global warming is such a dramatic threat to our livelihoods and future.</p> <p>Indeed, Romm has called Obama's failure to speak out about global warming, loudly and often, his \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-romm/obamas-other-climate-mess_b_1884150.html\">biggest communications mistake</a>.\"</p> <p>Now, a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2012/10/swing-voters-climate-change-issue\">raft of new polls</a> are showing that this issue has the potential to move independent and swing voters\u2014the subject of our <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/10/event-climate-changes-sleeper-role-election-2012\">first Climate Desk Live Capitol Hill briefing on October 10</a>. So we stopped to chat with Romm, who will present at the briefing, about his unique take on this subject.</p> <p><strong>Chris Mooney:</strong> You've been writing for a long time about how climate is a winning political issue. So what first got you onto this?</p> <p><strong>Joe Romm:</strong> Well, I didn't pursue this topic because I thought it was a political winner. I started when my brother lost his home in Katrina, he wanted to know if he should rebuild, so I talked to a lot of climate scientists. And then I realized, \"this is more dire than I thought, and climate scientists are not doing a good job of communicating it.\" So it was the underlying reality that gave me an urgency to stop doing what I was doing\u2014clean energy consulting\u2014and start doing communications full time.</p> <p>I have talked to the leading social scientists over the years. If you talk to <a href=\"http://comm.stanford.edu/faculty/krosnick/\">Jon Krosnick</a> or <a href=\"http://www.climatechangecommunication.org/edward_maibach.cfm\">Ed Maibach</a> or <a href=\"http://www.pages.drexel.edu/%7Ebrullerj/\">Robert Brulle</a>, they will tell you that this is an issue that the public broadly gets\u2013and that there is an <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/c7/c7h.htm#s3\">underlying respect for science and scientists</a>. And so there is a way to talk about this issue that does work politically.</p> <p>That said, there are ways to talk about it that aren't useful, and I think people have mistaken the blowback from bad communications for thinking there's no way to communicate on this issue. And I think that's just not right.</p> <p><strong>CM:</strong> Do you think this has always been true\u2014that climate change has always been a potential political winner\u2013or has it become more true over time?</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> I think many climate scientists have gotten better at communications because of Climategate. I think many of them thought they were like medical scientists\u2013you make your pronouncement, and then the patient does what he's told to do. And they realized that that's not how the political system works. You have to understand how to be an effective communicator.</p> <p>Since I had talked to all of these climate scientists and read the literature, I knew that climate change was coming faster than a lot of people thought. I knew it was going to be coming at this accelerated rate. So things are changing in real time, and now we've reached the point where the signal is distinguished from the noise.</p> <p>It was always the case that extreme weather was going to be the way that most people were going to experience climate change directly\u2014that seemed clear to me from all my research. Extreme weather is very random, but it is on top of a climate signal that continues to grow. So over time, you get more and more extreme events that are way above the natural variation.</p> <p>And so yes, I think we are now seeing events that are once in a thousand year events, like the Russian heat wave. I mean, Binghamton, New York had a one in one hundred year rain event in two consecutive years! And so that's led people like Jeff Masters to say, this is not the atmosphere I grew up with.</p> <p><strong>CM:</strong> If all of this is true, then where is the blockage between all the polling data on the one hand, and the behavior of political candidates on the other?</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> There's no question that the Obama team has gotten a misimpression that this is not a winning issue. And that I think is based on some rather questionable analysis done years ago, that basically said, \"if you only present the doom and gloom case, you turn some people off.\" But nobody really does that\u2014nobody I know does that.</p> <p><strong>CM:</strong> Do we see any candidates who get the message and are campaigning on climate?</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> I <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/10/04/944151/avoiding-obamas-mistake-senate-candidates-slam-gop-opponents-over-climate-denial/\">just published an article</a> which showed that at least some Senate candidates, including Angus King, Elizabeth Warren, and Bob Kerrey, have raised this as an issue. And after the 2010 election, I noted there were only two Senate campaigns in which it became an issue. And in both of those, the anti-science candidate got blowback\u2013Carly Fiorina in California and Ken Buck in Colorado. And they lost.</p> <p>The polling data seems clear: This is a classic wedge issue that separates conservatives not just from progressives, but also from moderates and independents. So you know, we can spend a lot of time being puzzled about why this administration does bizarre messaging. If you talk to communications experts, many will say this administration is not great at it. You can get upset about President Obama not bringing up climate change, but this is not an administration that's good at communicating\u2013and this is just one of the many areas that they mistakenly downplay.</p> <p><strong>CM:</strong> As someone who does study communication closely, how would you recommend politicians talk about this issue?</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> It depends on the audience, certainly. As someone who studies communication, I know that the most important thing is knowing who your audience is. And people who read my blog are not the general public.</p> <p>But, I've always believed that you should stick as closely to the science as possible. And my biggest advice to reporters has been, if you're doing a climate story, talk to climate scientists. The best climate stories are done by the people who talk to climate scientists. But I think this notion that you shouldn't talk about the science, or how dire things might be if we don't' act, that's silly.</p> <p>And on moral grounds, I think that if you believe a certain outcome is a very possible outcome, you have an obligation to tell people that. With global warming, the probability of a bad outcome if we stay on our current emission trends is incredibly high. If you know a bad outcome is likely to happen, what right do you have not to communicate that? You go into a doctor's office, what are they going to do\u2013not tell you the diagnosis?</p> <p>\u2022 You can hear more from Joe Romm at the 10 October Climate Desk Live event, entitled \"<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/10/event-climate-changes-sleeper-role-election-2012\">Climate Change's Sleeper Role in Election 2012</a>.\" This article was first published by the Guardian's partner, <a href=\"http://climatedesk.org/2012/10/why-arent-politicians-listening-to-this-guy-on-climate/\">Climate Desk</a></p>",
  "<p>In the biggest car recall since 1996, Toyota is calling back 7.4m vehicles worldwide after discovering faulty window switches in 12 models. In the UK, 138,000 cars are affected.</p> <p>The Japanese carmaker stressed that there have not been any accidents or injuries \u2013 the problem is the electric window switch which could feel uneven or notchy and could over time stick. There has been one reported case in the UK. Toyota said various simulation tests had shown there was no risk of fire.</p> <p>It is the biggest car recall since Ford was forced to call back 8m vehicles in 1996 to replace defective igntion switches that could cause engine fires.</p> <p>\"Recalls in the automotive sector are not rare events, but the size and scale of this particular recall is unusual,\" said Richard Matthews, head of product liability at international law firm Eversheds. \"Toyota faced heavy public scrutiny for the way it handled recalls in 2009-10, culminating in a record fine of $16.4m (\u00a310.2bn) from the US transportation department. Toyota's approach this time around is perhaps indicative of an increasingly 'belt and braces' approach to managing risk.\"</p> <p>Toyota already recalled more than 10m vehicles between 2009 and 2011 over various problems, and the latest recall will further damage its reputation. It is now calling back 1.39m vehicles in Europe, 2.47m in the US and 1.4m in China, as well as 459,000 in Japan, 650,000 in Australia and Asia and 490,000 vehicles in the Near and Middle East.</p> <p>The range of Toyota cars affected worldwide include some models of the Yaris, Vios, Corolla, Matrix, Auris, Camry, RAV4, Highlander, Tundra, Sequoia, xB and xD made between 2005 and 2010.</p> <p>In Britain, only three models are affected \u2013 the RAV4, Yaris and Auris. Toyota said the window switches take about an hour to fix. All affected owners will be contacted by Toyota GB within the next six weeks and asked to bring their car to the nearest Toyota centre. The dealer will check the window switch and will apply a special lubricant if it is operating properly, or replace it if not.</p> <p>The move comes a day after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/09/japanese-car-sales-china-islands-dispute\" title=\"\">Toyota reported a near-50% slump in sales in China</a> in September, where Japanese car brands have suffered because of anti-Japanese sentiment in the wake of a Sino-Japanese territorial dispute.</p> <p>Despite this, Matthews noted that Toyota's brand had proved remarkably resilient: in August it announced a quarterly profit of \u00a5290bn (\u00a32.3bn), the highest in four years, and the business still claims the top spot for global sales, with 4.87m units sold in the first half of 2012.</p>",
  "<p>\"Build it and they will come\". That was very much the philosophy that led to the creation of <a href=\"http://www.screenstockport.co.uk\">Screen Stockport Film Festival</a> around two years ago. What started out as making a short film with my friends, turned into a desire to create a film festival in Stockport to give fellow young filmmakers an opportunity to share their films with an audience. </p> <p>Screen Stockport was then born, with the ambition of it becoming an inclusive, grassroots film festival for filmmakers of all ages and experiences. I wanted to give young people who aspired to have a career in the media an environment to share their passion and enthusiasm with other creatives and connect with industry professionals from the North West. </p> <p>This year we're at <a href=\"http://www.stockportplaza.co.uk/\">the Plaza Super Cinema</a> in Stockport on Sunday 14 and Friday 19 October, for what is shaping up to be a great festival. There's such a diverse range of film on show, everything from a story about a sad tiger, to animated Heinz Salad Cream jars to an acoustic folk riot at a children's party in our 'Music Video' category. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397800500\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349848150560/Filmmakers.jpg\" alt=\"stockport\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Festival young filmmakers, between Joe Barratt (left) and the Plaza's general manager Ted Doan (right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Music is very much at the heart of this year's festival, building off the key role Stockport played in the development of the Manchester music scene. We've got director <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1475971/\">Mat Whitecross </a>and digital entrepreneur Andy Wood kicking off the festival by talking on our panel discussion about 'Music and Film' and 'The Art of the Music Video'. </p> <p>Mat will be talking about his experiences directing Coldplay's 'Paradise', 'Charlie Brown' and 'Lovers in Japan' music videos, as well as the Ian Dury biopic 'Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll' and the upcoming <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1827579/\">'Spike Island'</a>, about the legendary Stone Roses gig. </p> <p>Andy will be sharing with us how he co-created the <a href=\"http://www.amamusicagency.ie/blog/time-to-become-part-of-the-music/\">'Whole World Band' app </a>with 10cc band member Kevin Godley. The app innovatively fuses music and film together by allowing users to jam along with musical icons including Ronnie Wood from The Rolling Stones and The Edge from U2 by using an iPhone or iPad. </p> <p>We're also playing host to around 400 students from around the North West on Friday 19 October, and we'll be joined by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2011/05_may/27/bullough.shtml\">Helen Bullough, Head of CBBC Production</a>, Tom Clarke from The Sharp Project and independent filmmakers Danny Lacey and Dennis Keighron-Foster in our talk on 'Creative Opportunities in the North West'. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/50496330?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=623154\"> <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/50496330?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=623154\" width=\"460\" height=\"283\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/50496330\">Screen Stockport 2012 Festival Promo</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/screenstockport\">Screen Stockport</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p> </figure>  <p>Col Needham, the founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/\">IMDb.com</a>, will be giving a talk on Friday morning about how he managed to turn his passion for film into the creation of the worlds most popular movie website, transforming the way we interact with film forever. </p> <p>Having grown up in Denton and having worked at Curry's in Stockport, Col is a great role model for any local young person who wants to achieve big things through following their passion. </p> <p>Then on Friday night, we'll be screening the zombie comedy drama 'Harold's Going Stiff', which was the first feature film to be shot entirely on the Canon 7D, as well as the sci-fi short film 'Escape Plan C', which stars Clint Boon from the Inspiral Carpets and Bez from the Happy Mondays. </p> <p>This is all taking place at The Plaza Super Cinema, a fully restored, art deco cinema in the centre of Stockport, which will be celebrating its 80th anniversary during the week of our festival. I'm hoping the film festival will demonstrate how combining the energy of young people and the cultural heritage of Stockport is definitely the way forward for the town. <br> In the last few years there has been an upsurge of independent film festivals growing out of grassroots movements all over the UK, and I'm proud that Screen Stockport has been seen to be part of this revolution. </p> <p>In the North West now, Screen Stockport stands next to <a href=\"http://www.gmff.co.uk/\">Greater Manchester Film Festival</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cofilmic.co.uk/\">Cofilmic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.grimmfest.com/\">Grimmfest</a> as film festivals which have all emerged as a result of people seeing the need for each type of film festival in the region. </p> <p>With<a href=\"http://www.exposuresfestival.co.uk/\"> Exposures</a>, the leading student film festival in the UK, not running next year due to cuts in funding, it's even more vital that we can manage to sustain a festival like Screen Stockport, as it becomes an incredibly important event for the development of the country's next generation of filmmakers.</p> <p>The festival director of <a href=\"http://www.encounters-festival.org.uk/\">Bristol's Encounters Film Festival</a>, Mark Cosgrove, recently <a href=\"http://http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/sep/18/film-development-regions-industry-local-talent\">wrote a blog in <em>The Guardian</em> </a>about the need to create \"dynamic local and regional cultures and creative communities\". I think Screen Stockport has already gone a long way to achieve this and Mark's overall vision about the future of filmmaking and filmgoing in Britain seems spot on. </p> <p>The hardest part, however, will be getting <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/\">the BFI</a> and <a href=\"http://www.creativeengland.co.uk/\">Creative England </a>to see the need to support film festivals which have recently been built from the ground up to serve the need of filmmakers.

  "<p>Outside the Amnesty International main offices in London, the world's most polite picket line was taking a stand in the autumn sunshine. Human rights activists and workers went on strike on Wednesday, the first industrial action at the organisation for 20 years, arguing that cuts to the UK office were putting its future at risk.</p> <p>There was no chanting, no loudhailers, just a few placards carrying the phrase \"Workers rights = Human Rights\", as employees stood sipping tea and eating cake. The most subversive act of the day entailed quietly asking the postman not to deliver the post.</p> <p>But there was no lack of anger and disappointment, said Maggie Paterson, 67, who has worked in publishing at the charity for 15 years. \"None of us want to damage this organisation, we care too much about it, but when you see the whole thing being damaged it really feels like there is no alternative,\" she said.</p> <p>The battle between Amnesty's management and its UK workers stems from a decision last year to restructure the charity, opening more offices in far-flung region using local workers. It is moving from a centralised structure with resources concentrated in richer countries to the creation of regional hubs.</p> <p>The UK section, one of Amnesty's biggest offices and fundraisers, will have to provide 40% of its income to global operations, increased from 30% currently. The London management argues that in order to do this, cuts of \u00a32.5m must be made.</p> <p>About \u00a31.25m has already been shaved off costs, but the remaining cuts are expected to come at least in part from compulsory redundancies among the 200 part- and full-time workers. Where the cuts will fall is not yet known; workers are set to learn their fate on 25 October.</p> <p>James Savage, 42, who works in the activism team and has been at Amnesty for 13 years, said the majority of workers in the UK office agreed in principle with the shift in the organisation but were fiercely opposed to the manner in which it was happening.</p> <p>\"How could we be opposed to growing the organisation where it is needed?\" he said, pointing out that staff voted for a pay freeze last year in an attempt to help the situation. \"Staff cuts raise the question of how effective we can be as a campaigning organisation. There may have to be redundancies but the scale and pace at which they want to make these changes mean they are inevitable, and we don't think they are.\"</p> <p>Other workers argue that the risks of opening offices in sometimes dangerous regions have not been properly assessed, and fear that human rights work could be compromised. \"There is a real lack of transparency about what is going on,\" Paterson said. \"Carrying on with these changes without a serious understanding of what you are risking and how it is going to work in the future is quite scary. It feels like we have been thrown to the crows.\"</p> <p>Workers are concerned that campaigning \u2013 the reason many of them get out of bed in the mornings \u2013 will be outsourced to other offices. \"I have supported Amnesty all my life, but my fear is that what is happening to the organisation is willfully endangering its future,\" Paterson said. \"Amnesty is being treated like a balance sheet or a multinational corporation and it is so much more than that.\"</p> <p>Inside the very quiet Amnesty offices, management-level staff were still working. The campaigns director Tim Hancock said London managers recognised the staff's anxiety as the organisation experienced significant changes. \"Obviously we are disappointed staff feel the need to strike, but as you might expect from Amnesty International we entirely respect their right to do so,\" he said.</p> <p>The decision to restructure and move funds away from London was made democratically by the organisation's international committee in 2011, and was therefore not up for discussion, although management staff would continue to talk to workers about a range of issues including how the cuts would be implemented, Hancock said. Redundancies were likely, but he stressed that the UK office remained committed to activism and did not want to simply become the \"cash cow\" for the organisation.</p> <p>\"The biggest risk to Amnesty is to do nothing at all,\" he said. \"If we continue to operate without making these cuts we would severely endanger this section's financial health.\"</p>",
  "<p>This summer's poor UK harvest has left some supermarkets struggling to keep shelves stocked with fresh produce and taking the unusual step of apologising for the fact that some fruit and vegetables are of lower quality than usual.</p> <p>Following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/food-prices-rise-wettest-summer\" title=\"\">today's warning from the National Farmers' Union (NFU) on low wheat yields</a>, supermarkets have not ruled out the prospect of price rises in the future. But they pledged to help Britain's hard-pressed families by offering \"competitive pricing\" of staple and essential food items in their value and economy ranges.</p> <p>Asda said: \"We are working hard with our growers to give them long-term sustainability. Where crops have been badly affected by the weather, we have flexed our specifications to help British growers get as much of their produce into our stores as possible. Keeping prices low for our shoppers is as important now that it has ever been, and that will remain our commitment.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Waitrose said: \"There's no doubt that this has been an exceptionally tough growing season for our farmers who have been coping with very bad weather and rising costs for critical inputs such as fuel. We are working closely with all our growers to help them manage their costs and get as much of their crop on our shelves as possible through initiatives such as selling cosmetically imperfect but good quality fruit and veg - something we have always done.\"</p> <p>Sainsbury's said in a statement: \"We can't comment on future prices. We continue to do mix and match offers across fruit and vegetable such as two for \u00a33. We continue to work with British farmers and growers to get the most out of the crop. We've taken the decision to radically change our approach to buying British fruit and vegetables as a result of this year's unseasonal weather.\"</p> <p>The run of unpredictable weather this season has left farmers and growers with bumper crops of \"ugly\" fruit and vegetables with reported increases in blemishes and scarring, as well as shortages due to later crops. This week, Sainsbury's launched a trial of its Basics range of potatoes that have visible cracks and blemishes in more than 35 stores in the Midlands. Last month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/27/ugly-fruit-vegetables-supermarkets-harvest\" title=\"\">the supermarket said</a> it was relaxing its rules on the cosmetic appereance of fresh produce.</p> <p>A Tesco spokeswoman said: \"British farmers have had a challenging summer with bad weather affecting crops and horticulture in particular. We're supporting our farmers and suppliers at this time and working very closely with them to understand the impact of this year's harvest. We will also continue to offer our customers great value at a difficult time for many families.\"</p> <p>New research by consumer group Which? found that the average cost of a shopping bill is now \u00a376.83 per week - an increase of \u00a35.66 compared with a year ago. Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: \"The rising price of food is one of consumers' top financial worries and is changing the way we shop. Recent Which? research found more of us are shopping at discount supermarkets and four in 10 people told us they planned to cut back on their food shopping. We want retailers to be clearer about food pricing and offer responsible price promotions that give the consumer the best possible value for money.\"</p> <p>Conservative MP Laura Sandys said: \"Today's report by the NFU reaffirms the urgent need to put the consumer at the very heart of policy-making. With those on benefits, low-income families and pensioners having to bear the brunt of increasing food prices, government needs to put in place measures to support families to become more resilient to manage the rising cost of living. It cannot be right that UK consumers' weekly shop has increased by 6.4% - double the EU average.\"</p> <p>New figures from the charity <a href=\"http://www.fareshare.org.uk/\" title=\"\">FareShare</a> \u2013 that fights hunger and food waste in the UK \u2013 shows that lower income families have cut their consumption of fruit and vegetables by nearly one-third in the wake of the recession and rising food prices, to just over half of the five-a-day portions recommended for a healthy diet. And in the UK some 5.8 million people are living in deep poverty, meaning they struggle to afford everyday essentials like food.</p> <p>Richard Dodd, spokesman for the British Retail Consortium, said: \"There are price pressures in the system which are coming from poor wheat harvests in this country but also in the other big wheat-producing countries. Our own figures for the shop price inflation for food show that it has been very, very stable \u2013 it has been 3.1 % for the last three months which is a two-year low and compares with over 10% in 2008. There is no food price explosion going on but there are pressures in the system that will work through. Our fiercely competitive retail market is protecting customers from the worst effects of these price pressures.\"</p>",

Yes, it's worse than we thought, yes, it's taking longer, but we are making progress.</p> <p>\"The country is on the rise and we are selling to the world again,\" he said, adding it was a time of reckoning, when the country would \"either sink or swim, do or decline\".</p> <p>As evidence that the economy was on the mend, he cited the creation of 1m new jobs in the private sector, saying this was in net terms more than Labour managed in 10 years. In his only specific growth measure, he said Britain's planning laws would have to be scrapped so more housing could be built, vowing to scrap \"the suffocating bureaucracy\" that he said was holding economic growth back.</p> <p>He said: \"There are too many 'yes but no' people. The ones who say: 'Yes, our business needs to expand, but no, we cannot reform planning'.\"</p> <p>He said: \"If we are going to be a winner in this global race we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all.</p> <p>He also attacked the so-called \"Nimbys\", saying it had been \"OK for his generation that had got on the housing ladder\". But he pointed out that the average age that people buy their first home today without any help from their parents was 33.He insisted: \"We are the party of home ownership. We cannot let this carry on. We have to accept we need to build more houses in Britain.</p> <p>\"There are people who work hard year after year but are still living at home. They sit in their childhood bedroom looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own.\"</p> <p>He also issued a strong defence of his plans to cut welfare, as well as his free school programme.</p> <p>He insisted in British politics it was the Conservative party that was saying no one was a write-off, adding that his goal was not to hoard privilege but to spread it.</p> <p>He defended his work experience scheme, attacking those who compared it to workhouses or said it was state-sponsored slavery. He replied: \"What an appalling, snobbish attitude to the idea of work. We're not sending children up chimneys. We're giving them a chance. What's cruel is not asking something of people \u2013 it's when we ask nothing of them. Work is not slavery, it's poverty that is slavery, and again it is us, the modern, compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.\"</p> <p>He also set out plans to end automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25, saying for some people there was a soft option of \"don't get a job, sign on, don't ever need to produce a CV when you do sign on. Get housing benefit, get a flat and then don't ever get a job, or you will lose a load of housing benefit.\"</p> <p>He also attacked the \"leftwing establishment in education \u2013 the leftwing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers' unions, the Labour party theorists that stand in the way of aspirational parents by excusing low expectations and blaming social disadvantage\".</p> <p>He said: \"It's that toxic culture of low expectations \u2013 that lack of ambition for every child \u2013 which has held this country back.\"</p> <p>He said he wanted more free schools, academies, more rigour, and \"more expected of every child\".</p> <p>Refusing to back away from his schooling at Eton, he added: \"To all those people who say he wants children to have the kind of education he had at his posh school, I say: 'Yes, you are absolutely right.'\"</p> <p>He launched a number of attacks on Labour, but was silent on his coalition partners. He attacked Miliband by saying: \"While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you. They call us the party of the better off. No, we are the party of the want to be better off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families \u2013 and we should never be ashamed of saying so.\"</p> <p>He promised that \"those with the broadest shoulders would bear the greatest burden. With us the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this parliament than in any one of the 13 years under Labour.\"</p> <p>Previewing the attack he will mount at the next election, he said he did not think Labour had learned a single thing. \"When they were in office, their answer was always borrow more money. Now they are out of office, it's borrow more money whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it is, borrow more money.\"</p>",

Satellite pictures of Greenland, where the ice sheet rests on land, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/24/greenland-ice-sheet-thaw-nasa\" title=\"\">showed more widespread melting than ever recorded</a>.</p> <p>Scientists from the Universities of Sheffield in the UK and Rutgers and Washington in the US, with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have established what they say is a clear link between the shrinking ice and more extreme weather in lower latitudes, through weather effects such as the \"Arctic amplification\" and shifting wind patterns.</p> <p>Edward Hanna, co-author of the study at Sheffield University, said the research should alert people in the UK to the reality of global warming: \"It really puts global warming in the public eye. It's virtually impossible to predict the weather for any particular summer but we could have cooler, wetter summers on average in the UK because of this effect. That's not to say we won't get hot, dry summers but just that these might not be as frequent as you might expect from a straightforward global warming effect. There seems to have been a new regime in summer 2007 that has more or less stayed in place since.\"</p> <p>This year's weather broke records in England, for a dry spring followed by the wettest ever April to June, and June had the second lowest sunshine on record. For most people, the weather was a disappointment as one dull and rainy day followed another. But for others, the pain was even greater \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/food-prices-rise-wettest-summer\" title=\"\">farmers suffered the worst weather combination</a>, with drought followed by a disastrously damp spell that first withered and then waterlogged crops. Retailers and the leisure industries were also hurt, with people eschewing barbecue food and tourists and holidaymakers avoiding attractions.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Greenlanders and inhabitants of some of the most northern isles of the UK enjoyed glorious sunshine.</p> <p>This weather pattern was linked to the position of the jet stream, which normally brings settled weather to the UK in the summer but has been shifting in position for the past several years. The past six summers have been duller and wetter than the long-term average, according to the Met Office.</p> <p>For the new study, researchers examined data from the past six summers. They found west- to east-flowing winds in high latitudes have been replaced by a wavier pattern in those years, which contributed to the dull weather further south.</p> <p>Many people in the UK assume that global warming would bring them hotter and drier weather \u2013 a \"Mediterranean climate\", according to common predictions. This study shows that the reality may be much less pleasant.</p> <p>Hanna said: \"While global warming itself may pass unnoticed by many, its complex interactions with ice and snow in high latitudes are expected to alter atmospheric circulations that contribute to enhanced Arctic warming, further melt, and an increased probability of extreme weather events both in the Arctic and in mid-latitudes.\"</p> <p>One of the factors behind this year's record ice melt was stronger winds flowing from the Bering Straits in the Arctic, across the north pole and over the Atlantic, transferring heat from the south to further north and pushing sea ice further north across the Arctic, according to the research. Over Greenland, unusually high pressure led to the record melting across nearly the whole of the land ice sheet.</p> <p>If Arctic ice continues at low levels in future summers, more extreme weather is likely in future, the study found.</p>",
  "<p>As the US supreme court once again wrestles with affirmative action this week, <a href=\"http://www.acri.org/ward_bio.html\">Ward Connerly</a> is doubtlessly a happy man. I am sure the former UC Regent, who launched his nationwide assault on affirmative action from California, will join others in their effort to permanently end the use of race in college admissions at the University of Texas and beyond. It's a misguided effort, because the university's policy is constitutional. What's more, it's working.</p> <p>The facts in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_v._University_of_Texas\">Texas case</a> are these: Abigail Fisher filed suit in 2008 claiming that she was denied undergraduate admission to the University of Texas because she was white. She lost in the lower courts but the justices agreed to hear her case this term.</p> <p>Fisher contends that the University of Texas treated her unfairly. She believes that race was the main reason she was rejected, and that race has no place in university admissions.</p> <p>The facts tell a different story. The university makes only limited use of race in its admission decisions. Most undergraduates are admitted through a state law that guarantees the top 10% of state high school graduates entrance to a state university. Fisher did not qualify. Texas admits its remaining students through a review process that considers race among a number of other factors like socioeconomic background and leadership potential. Race is not a dominant factor in admissions. Instead, Texas uses a holistic process in which applicants of any race can benefit. One's race is not the sum of their file; it's only a part of it. </p> <p>This use of race complies with the court's rulings. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grutter_v._Bollinger\">landmark Grutter decision</a> gives universities the freedom to consider race as one factor for admission in order to promote diversity and recruit under-represented minorities. With a rapidly growing minority population and a globalizing economy, the university has a legitimate interest to fulfil: recruiting a highly-qualified and representative student body and to prepare all of their students for a global workforce.</p> <p>Texas' approach to admissions stands in stark contrast to other state universities across the nation. Take my home state, California. After the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996, which ended affirmative action, the number of African Americans and Latinos admitted declined significantly. Nowhere was the effect more strongly felt than at Berkeley. In 1995, UC Berkeley's entering class was 7.3% black, but by 1998, that number dropped by more than half, to 3.2%. By 2011, that percentage had only slightly risen to 3.9%. The state's prohibition on considering race in admissions left an indelible mark, as the <a href=\"http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/28178\">UC's Fisher amicus brief</a> confirms. In an increasingly polyglot nation, what's left of our commitment to diversity?</p> <p>Opponents argue that considering race in admissions is no longer necessary. Yet, even though Barack Obama now lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the evidence regularly shows large and pervasive racial disparities in important aspects of contemporary American life. These include access to quality schools, employment, obesity rates, incarceration levels, and poverty. A <a href=\"http://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/news/press-releases/crp-press-releases-2012/civil-rights-project-reports-deepening-segregation-and-challenges-educators-and-political-leaders-to-develop-positive-policies\">UCLA report released last month</a> found that school segregation is especially pronounced and that it has increased in recent years; what's more, black and Latino kids are much more likely to attend poorer schools.</p> <p>Such inequities have only grown since the onset of the great recession. Without policies that consider race, similar to Texas' approach, public university students will be less likely to enjoy the benefits of a truly diverse student body. </p> <p>Opponents believe that race-based admissions stigmatize minority students. Wrong: the research shows that feelings of inferiority were <em>lower</em> among minorities in schools with race-conscious admissions than those that prohibited affirmative action. Moreover, minorities attending elite colleges graduate at much higher rates than those who went to less selective institutions.</p> <p>Ultimately, the high court will have the final say on Texas' admissions policy. Regardless of the outcome, then, we need to think constructively about how to strengthen our public universities and prepare our next generation. The demographics of the nation are changing. Minorities will comprise over half the population in 30 years. </p> <p>Instead of employing diversity tactics that don't work, let's reconsider race in admissions as Texas has done. It not only secures diversity and furthers our global competitiveness, but also gives all Americans a fairer shot at success. There is nothing more important than that.<br>&#xa0;</p>",
  "<p>New <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/al992e/al992e00.pdf#page=10\" title=\"\">UN forecasts</a> indicate world cereal production will be reduced by 2.6% in 2012 following last year's record crop. Wheat production is expected to fall 5.2% \u2013 largely because of the heatwave in the United States, and other grains by 2.3%. The global rice crop is expected to remain mostly unchanged, with falls in India offset by an increase in China, Japan and the Philippines.</p> <p>\"The decrease will result in a significant reduction in world inventories by the close of seasons in 2013, even with world demand sliding as a result of high prices,\" said a spokesman for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation in Rome.</p> <h2>US</h2> <p>Record heat in June and July and the worst drought since 1956 has reduced US wheat, maize and soy harvests by more than 10%. Because the US is by far the world's biggest grower and exporter of grains, this is expected to have repercussions around the world. Farmers are still harvesting their crops but the maize harvest is expected to be the lowest in nine years. Nearly 40% of all US maize is now used in biofuels, further restricting exports and raising prices.</p> <h2>Europe</h2> <p>The European Union is the world's third-largest grain grower but harvests this year are expected to be 5-10% less than last year due to summer heat and drought damage. France and Germany, Europe's top growers, have had a good year but not enough to offset declines in Britain, Spain and Italy. The wheat harvest is expected to be the lowest in five years.</p> <h2>India, Bangladesh, Pakistan</h2> <p>Delayed and then erratic monsoon rains have hit Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi rice production. The UN expects India, the world's largest rice producer, to grow 6% less this year after record harvests last year.</p> <h2>Brazil</h2> <p>Brazil, the largest Latin American producer and exporter of grains, expects a bumper harvest partly because it has increased the area under cultivation by nearly 10%. Maize production is up 27% on last year.</p> <h2>Ukraine</h2> <p>Drought in the sowing season has reduced Ukraine's wheat harvest to 15m tonnes, a reduction of nearly 30% compared to last year. Barley and maize harvests are down 5-10%, says the farm ministry.</p> <h2>Canada</h2> <p>The Canadian wheat harvest is expected to be the biggest in three years and the third largest since 1999. But its canola (oil seed rape) harvest was much smaller than expected and well below last year's production.</p> <h2>Developing countries</h2> <p>Low-income countries, mainly in Africa, increased cereal production significantly in 2012, and the UN says these nations will need 5% less food imports. But the total import bill is expected to rise because of higher world prices. Afghanistan has seen a bumper grain harvest, but southern Africa has been hit by bad weather. Morocco, North Korea and Haiti all expect much lower harvests.</p> <h2>Far east Asia</h2> <p>Rice and cereal harvests in the far east (China, Japan, the Philippines) are expected to break all records, says the UN. But delayed monsoon and erratic weather conditions may dampen the final outcome, says the UN.</p>",

  "<p>Are rising bills at the supermarket checkout turning out to be the first tangible impact of climate change on the daily lives of all Britons? It very much seems so.</p> <p>The damage wreaked by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/food-prices-rise-wettest-summer?intcmp=122\">dismal summer of 2012 on UK harvests</a> was revealed on Monday and will push food prices up. In these austere times, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/21/councils-invest-food-banks-welfare-cuts\">food banks</a> feeding the hungry, that is going to hurt.</p> <p>There are two lessons to be learned. First, the UK is not going to gradually warm into a pleasant Mediterranean climate, with sunny resorts on the coast supplied by burgeoning English vineyards. The heating of the climate system leads to greater extremes in weather and greater damage. Second, with much of our food imported from around the world, the totals we tot up at the tills is at the mercy of global warming's impact on the whole globe.</p> <p>The UK has suffered a run of sodden summers over the last half dozen years or so. Untangling the influence of humanity's carbon dioxide pollution from natural variations in a complex and chaotic weather system is not easy, but a fast growing number of studies are beginning to make firm links.</p> <p>Warmer waters in the North Atlantic were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/oct/07/north-atlantic-ocean-wet-summer\">linked to wet UK summers</a> in a study published on Monday, with its authors stating \"there is lot of evidence to show that climate change is changing the timing and magnitude\" of natural cycles. New research published today links a change in <a href=\"http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL053268.shtml\">summer Arctic wind patterns to the ice melted by global warming</a> and to an increase in unpredictable UK weather. Edward Hanna, at the University of Sheffield, led that study and said: \"While global warming itself may pass unnoticed by many, its complex interactions with ice in high latitudes are expected to contribute to ... an increased probability of extreme weather events both in the Arctic and in mid-latitudes.\" The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/08/shape-of-british-summers-to-come\">meandering of the jet stream</a>, which usually shepherds rainstorms to the north of the UK, is a key factor.</p> <p>Around the world, the damage global warming can cause to food production is becoming clearer. A heatwave in Russia this summer has destroyed a third of its vast grain crop. A similar devastating heatwave in 2010 has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/21/climate-change-russian-heatwave\">directly linked to global warming</a> by scientists, who concluded the chances of it happening had been tripled by our fossil fuel burning. Another study predicted that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/17/deadly-heatwaves-europe?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\">\"mega-heatwaves\" in Europe</a> will become five to 10 times more likely over the next 40 years.</p> <p>In the US this summer, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/23/us-drought-global-food-crisis\">worst drought in 50 years</a> has destroyed almost <a href=\"http://www.hsbcnet.com/gbm/global-insights/insights/2012/less-bread-for-your-dough.html\">half the corn crop and a third of the soya bean crop</a>. It will take time for scientists to elucidate the link to climate change here, but more heatwaves are exactly what are expected in a overheating world.</p> <p>The message of the UK's dreadful harvest is clear, according to Prof Richard Tiffin, director of the Centre for Food Security at University of Reading. \"It should be a major warning that climate change is increasingly having a global impact on the food supply. If the problems in Russia, the UK and the US this year were combined with a failure of the Indian monsoon, we could see a major global food crisis that would have an enormous impact on food prices and badly affect poor people in the UK and around the world.\"</p> <p>If anything, Tiffin's warning should be even starker: 50 civil wars since 1950 have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/24/el-nino-cycle-deadly-conflict\">triggered by climatic changes cutting food production</a>, and some research suggests soaring food prices was a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/aug/25/food-price-arab-middle-east-protests\">key trigger in the Arab Spring</a> uprisings.</p> <p>In 2009, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir John Beddington, warned the world faced a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/mar/18/perfect-storm-john-beddington-energy-food-climate\"> \"perfect storm\" of food, water and energy problems</a>, due to <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/go-science/news/speeches/the-perfect-storm\">global warming and the rising world population</a>. The UK has experienced soaring energy bills, droughts and floods, and now crop failures. Beddington predicted his storm would hit in 2030. It may be arriving early and as close to home as your supermarket checkout.</p>",
  "<p>A Republican congressman at the forefront of hearings into the killing of the US ambassador to Libya has attempted to directly tie the White House to security decisions that may have contributed to the disaster.</p> <p>Jason Chaffetz has alleged that there was a \"co-ordinated effort\" between the White House and the state department to scale down security at US diplomatic missions in Libya in the months before a militia attacked the American consulate in Benghazi on September 11, killing the ambassador, Chris Stevens, and three other officials.</p> <p>Chaffetz's allegation comes ahead of a hearing by the House of Representatives oversight committee on Wednesday into whether the state department failed to heed warnings from Stevens and its own security personnel of the scale of the threat.</p> <p>US state department officials on Tuesday<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/chris-stevens-libya-consulate-attack\"> gave their most detailed description yet of the events in Benghazi</a>, and backed away from earlier assertions that the incident was triggered by protests against an anti-Islam video.</p> <p>They described frantic and prolonged efforts to rescue the ambassador, Chris Stevens, from a smoke-filled \"safe haven\" inside the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi where he apparently died of asphyxiation.</p> <p>The officials said there was nothing unusual happening near the Benghazi mission before the assault. Earlier accounts by White House and state department officials, including Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the United Nations, suggested that the attacks were triggered by protests over a video made in California that insulted the prophet Muhammad.</p> <p>Last week, Chaffetz, chairman of a subcommittee on national security, and congressman Darrell Issa, chairman of the oversight committee, wrote to Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/29/republicans-obama-chris-stevens-libya\">accusing the administration of incompetence and covering up the true nature</a> of what they say was a well-planned terrorist assault with links to al-Qaida.</p> <p>Now, in an attempt to pin ultimate responsibility on Barack Obama, Chaffetz says those cuts were at the behest of the White House.</p> <p>\"It seems to be a coordinated effort between the White House and the state department, from Secretary Clinton to President Obama's White House,\" Chaffetz told Fox News. \"There was a very conscious decision made. My personal opinion is that they wanted the appearance of normalisation there in Libya, and [that] putting up barbed wire on our facility would lead to the wrong impression. Something that this administration didn't want to have moving forward.\"</p> <p>However, Chaffetz admitted he had no evidence for his assertion.</p> <p>Chaffetz and Issa are also vulnerable to accusations of hypocrisy after it was revealed that both congressmen voted to cut the state department's diplomatic security budget after Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in 2010. Republicans have shaved nearly $800m off state department spending on worldwide security over the past two years including $376m cut from embassy protection this year alone.</p> <p>Among those called to testify before the oversight committee is the former head of US security in Libya, lieutenant colonel Andy Wood. He told CBS news that American officials, including himself and Stevens, made repeated calls for more security personnel in the months prior to the attack but the state department cut back instead.</p> <p>\"We tried to illustrate \u2026 to show them how dangerous and how volatile and just unpredictable that whole environment was over there. So to decrease security in the face of that really is \u2026 it's just unbelievable,\" Wood said.</p> <p>He told CBS that when he was told that his 16-member team and a separate state department elite force of six were being withdrawn from Libya in August he felt \"like we were being asked to play the piano with two fingers. There was concern amongst the entire embassy staff\".</p> <p>\"They asked if we were safe,\" he said. \"They asked \u2026 what was going to happen, and I could only answer that what we were being told is that they're working on it \u2013 they'll get us more (security personnel), but I never saw that.\"</p> <p>The state department denies Wood's claim, saying there was no reduction in security personnel in the weeks before the attack in Benghazi. It said that when Wood's unit was withdrawn it was replaced bother others and that the number of security personnel in Libya remained constant.</p> <p>The state department also said Wood was based in Tripoli and had no knowledge of the situation in Benghazi, 400 miles away.</p> <p>The US under-secretary of state for management, Patrick Kennedy, will be the highest state department official to testify.</p>",
  "<p>The ground shook around Jewel and he crashed into the frame of the metal box. He cartwheeled like a seasoned gymnast just as the crane came crashing down, cutting through the top of the control cabin.</p> <p>It was snowing heavily and the ice froze Jewel's unprotected head. The whole mine had split apart from the explosion. Half of it had crumbled like dissolving salt. The rest was cracked and uneven. Most of it tilted down into the giant cavern that had once been the mining pit. The red lights blinked on as the shriek of the emergency alert cut through the cold air.</p> <p>Very slowly, a giant figure was rising out of the pit, as if making use of his limbs for the very first time, like a baby. Jewel barely glanced at the miners, rushing about in fear. He thought of the operation that had been assigned to him five days ago, and how it had come to this.<br><strong><br>7 Days Ago:</strong></p> <p>Doomus's heels made sharp clicking noises as he walked on the blood-dyed marble. It was made of the hardest skulls, as had been said by the owner of 'HELL HALLS Inc.' He regretted the gift he had presented to his father for his 4.55 billionth birthday.</p> <p>He crossed a dark courtyard adorned with beautiful blood-bloomed roses. The sky was blazing red. Crows and vultures looked down from their perches on the dead trees. He opened a shadow door with a shadow key and cautiously tip- toed into his father's library.</p> <p>His father was quite famous in the world of humans for all the wrong reasons. He was the devil. He was known by many names but 'Devil' was his original identity. A strong palm on his shoulder suddenly pulled Doomus back. He whirled around to find his father staring at him with his dark, deep red eyes. He was a muscular hell-man. He had muscles the size of femurs, as hard as diamond. He wore a suit with his long, trident shaped tail jutting out, which he used on his enemies. He had the horns of a goat, not of a bull.</p> <p>He stared at Doomus, disappointed by what he saw. Doomus had no muscles, but was thin and weak. He didn't have horns and had weak eyesight. He steered Doomus clear off the wall and dragged him (unknowingly dragged) into a chair.</p> <p> \"Doomus. I need your help. You are smart. You can open the core of the earth with your sorcery.\"</p> <p>Doomus replied,\" I will try father.\" </p> <p>The core contained a mysterious trophy. This trophy could help them take over the world!</p> <p><strong>5 Days Ago:</strong></p> <p>Jewel knew that he should not have accepted the assignment. But D.T stood in front of him, staring past his head, looking at an unknown destination. Jewel knew he was calculating risks, going over the plan, looking for loopholes.</p> <p>The plan was this:</p> <p>There had been illegal mining taking place in Russia. The miners were causing a major threat to the Russian government. Jewel was supposed to go and find a way to stop the mining. This sounded ridiculous, but nothing was ridiculous in front of D.T's eyes. Especially since the miners were carrying guns, grenades and Flash Grenades. They must have had something to hide.</p> <p>Jewel was sucked back into reality when his helping hand, a Siberian husky called Gem nudged him with his snout. Gem was white in colour with flashing grey stripes on his back. He was a very clever specimen of Siberian huskies. Gem nudged him again, this time more persistently. D.T was staring at him, with his eyebrow raised like a question mark. </p> <p>\"Well?\" he asked. </p> <p>\"I accept\", replied Jewel in a grim tone. This was his fifteenth mission. </p> <p>Jewel was to be kitted with the translator Bluetooth communications headset; Pulse, heat, x-ray and thermal vision; SR-98 sniper rifle, Walther P99 and a helmet with complete arctic warfare gear.</p> <p>Jewel slept through the ride on the giant Hercules airplane. It had a modified Jet engine and was able to hover on the spot, which it did as soon as it was time for Jewel and Gem to parachute into the mountains. Jewel was nervous to jump off when the ramp opened up. He took a running leap and dived off, expecting to feel the rush of wind on his face but the mask and goggles repelled it all. The next thing he knew, his parachute opened with a jerk,<br>pulling him up as the air got trapped in. He landed next to a metal box. The lookout point! He rushed through the blizzard and opened the front door.</p> <p>It was surprisingly warm inside. A fire glowed brightly in the hearth. A set of snug sofas and chairs stood around a 'SAMSUNG 52 POLEGADAS 1080 3D TOUCH SCREEN' television set. An XBOX was connected into the panel behind it. A boy stood in the room, examining a set of 3d blueprints on the TV. He turned around and gave Jewel a bright smile. </p> <p>\"Hello Jewel. I'm Keshav, but you can call me Snipes. This is my helping hand, Dash!\" He pointed to a dog in a camouflage suit, sitting at his feet. He was a chocolate brown Miniature Pinscher. \"Come in. I'll give you something to eat. Would you like Indian or Chinese cuisine?\" </p> <p>Two hours later, Jewel was seated on a comfy sofa. He was watching the screen. Keshav was giving an explanation on how the mine worked. </p> <p>\"The workers are under a spell. I can guarantee it. I think that the spell works from the bottom of the mine. If we can get to the control room, we can break<br>the charm and help the miners. There's something we're not being told but don't ponder over it tonight and have sweet dreams.\"</p> <p><strong>1 Day Ago:</strong></p> <p>They had been scouting the mine for four days. Now, it was time to move in on the target. They were kitted up again. Keshav and Dash led Jewel and Gem into an underground bunker where the weapons were stored. It was sealed with a passcode. Jewel was surprised by the amount of crates that were stacked around him. Keshav opened one to reveal two white snowmobiles that were packed with emergency gear. A walk ahead revealed an armored jeep. This was their escape transport system. </p> <p>He jumped in and closed the door to reveal a warm interior. Keshav got in beside him.</p> <p>\"I'll drive,\" said Jewel. He typed the coordinates into the SATNAV. They got to see the mine from the close mountain. Jewel held up binoculars and looked through to reveal a closer view of the complex. There was a ski jump leading to the control room. There were many heavy cranes and buildings. The area was crawling with guards. Keshav extracted the snowmobiles and they set off into the blizzard that formed around them.</p> <p>They rode silently to the ski jump, dropping any of the guards that came by. They were soon streaking down a sparkling white set of stairs. They ditched the mobiles and snuck up to the door of the control room. Keshav kicked it open and ran in, screaming orders in Russian. Jewel hefted his Dragunov and followed. He was surprised to find the control room filled with people. A red man sat in front of them. A smaller version of this man sneered at them from behind him. </p> <p>\"Hello, Welcome to the room of hell! I'm Devil, your host for tonight. You must be the boys that Dump Thump sent me!\"</p> <p>Jewel was tied to a chair and was forced to listen to the man's words. Gem was thrown onto his chest and against the man's wishes; it provided him a small comfort. The man looked at them. He took a breath and began to speak.</p> <p>\"I was born 4.55 billion years ago. I was an interesting child. I was able to do evil things. They called me De Vilan. That's old world talk for the 'Judge of Life.' That is what I became: Devil. I have planned something great for the world. It is the greatest calamity of all. I have always wanted to be king!\" He paused and spoke again. \"I could not rule a living world. Now I will rule a dead world!\" He laughed like a maniac. </p> <p>That was when a worker interrupted, \" Sir! Our magic level is going down in the pot. Please do something!\" </p> <p>The young devil walked to an oozing cauldron beside him and said some gibberish. The metal vessel filled again. </p> <p>\"Sir! The mine is vibrating! It is beginning!\" </p> <p>\"Yes!\" screamed Devil. He walked to the bank of computers on the side. Then the world exploded!</p> <p><strong>Present Time:</strong></p> <p>Jewel woke up. It had been almost 24 hours since he had been wounded. Chaos was all around him. He got to his feet, only to lose his center of balance again. Keshav was standing over him. He pulled Jewel onto his shoulder. Dash did the same for Gem. They were off.</p> <p>A figure was coming out of the pit, spitting fire. The iced edges of the mine had melted. Keshav supported Jewel to a nearby lift and helped him in. Jewel was relieved when he saw the bright light of the outside world. He got to his feet and struggled to the door. The miners ran up and down. Jewel realized that he was on a platform high above the mine. The C4 they had planted at ground level had exploded, ripping the mine apart. The noise of screaming men scared him. He pushed through the crowd and to the exit of the mine. </p> <p>The young devil appeared in front of him. </p> <p>\"This is your fault! My father is dead! I will kill you!\" </p> <p>He lunged forward, dagger in hand. Jewel dodged him. The boy changed his form into that of a bull. An imaginary voice rang out behind Jewel's temple: <em>Senores, Senoritas! Witness the battle to death!</em> The bull lunged towards him. </p> <p>\"Nobody can stop me unless my brain is blown out!\" And his brain was blown out. Good thing. Bad thing, it was scrambled on the white, icy ground (and unfortunately onto Jewel's protective suit). Keshav had fired from his gun! The boy (bull, same thing) fell. His dagger slipped away. </p> <p>Keshav resumed his journey to the Snipes' Mobile. As he passed the mine pit, he threw all the last bags of C4 into it. They came into contact with the figure and exploded. He screamed in pain and began to sink back down into the earth. Jewel was in the car before he knew it. He drifted into a dream world as the car started up and drove away. He knew that every turn of the wheel would lead him away from the horrible pit.</p> <p><strong>7 Days Later:</strong></p> <p>Keshav was a little nervous. They were sitting side by side in Dump Thump's study. The kangaroo himself sat in front of them.</p> <p>\"I know you are wanting an explanation. The giant creature in the mine was a Contonenta. He was one of the seven. He was one of the last too. The red man was Devil. He was the cause for the horrible carelessness of the humans. Now that he and his son are dead the world is going green again. You have restored peace to us. Devil planned to raise the Contonenta so that he could destroy the world. You have ended a war since the start of time. Your missions are over for now. Our department will close down. Goodbye!\" He shook their hands. They were escorted outside.</p> <p>D.T smiled to himself. He had set it all up. It was the only way to end the pollution and his tiresome job. He had schemed with the Devil. He had sent him to the core of the earth and he had brought back the key to open the door to the Contonenta. He had not disclosed to him the end result. Dump Thump allowed himself another gleeful grin. He merrily began to shut down the Globe through his computer. The happy days were just about to begin!</p> <p>D.T was thought to be a kangaroo aiming for world domination. The truth is that he was actually trying to save the world from the distribution of toxic waste and greenhouse gases that mingle with the earth's atmosphere. These are the tools that cause global warming. </p> <p>We must always remember that the world is the only life-bearing planet, but its resources are fast being consumed. We must be aware and try to maintain the planet. Many natural species such as trees give us oxygen. If we fell forests and set up mines, oil-rigs and other industries like these, we are draining the earth, polluting it and endangering animals and humans alike. </p> <p>All living things have a right to live, and just because we are stronger and often more intelligent, it doesn't mean that we should destroy their natural habitats to create new ones for us. If this happens to us, we would think it to be an act of robbery and crime.</p> <p>Krazy Kesh's Perspective:</p> <p>Prevent<br>Protect<br>Preserve</p> <p><strong>Are you a budding writer or poet? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your scribblings!</strong></p>",
  "<h2><strong>1. 'White van' Conservatism is now the dominant ideology in the party</strong></h2> <p>The phrase comes from Robert Halfon, the Harlow MP, but other Tories talk about blue collar Conservatism or helping the \"strivers\", and Eric Pickles puts it in terms of Essex values. Alternatively, you could call it Tabloid Toryism, or just Thatcherism. It's the thread that binds together all the main announcements at the conference, such as curbs on benefit claimants, the \"stab-a-burglar\" law, tougher punishments for offenders and the council-tax freeze. Individually, these policies may be quite popular, but collectively they depict a grim picture of Britain, which is why the \"nasty party\" label has been heard again in Birmingham. There was almost nothing at the conference about quality of life issues and David Cameron's \"let sunshine rule the day\" is now just a distant memory.</p> <h2><strong>2. The Conservatives are not worried about 'one nation' Labour</strong></h2> <p>They believe it is an empty marketing slogan and it is clear they are going to fight Labour in 2015 exactly as they did in 2010 \u2013 by attacking the party as financially irresponsible. The Conservatives have spent all week trying to assert their own one nation credentials although, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/08/osborne-speech-conservative-conference-live-blog#block-5072d322c0e361310bc6c9dc\" title=\"\">as George Osborne made clear in his speech</a>, there's a difference between their one nation and Labour's. Theirs is for strivers; benefit claimants who lie in bed with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/08/curtains-closed-blinds-down-george-osborne\" title=\"\">\"blinds down\"</a> instead of going to work aren't included.</p> <h2><strong>3. The 'big society' is over</strong></h2> <p>It was Cameron's big idea at the 2010 election, but even then it was a hard sell electorally and prolonged austerity seems to have finished it off.</p> <p>We're told that Cameron is going to reaffirm his commitment to the idea in his speech later. But, without having read the speech, it is hard to see how this will amount to much more than a concession to nostalgia. No one else has been talking about the big society at the conference and, as an ideological frame for policy, it seems to have collapsed.</p> <h2><strong>4. The Conservatives are more worried than Labour about the threat to Britain's long-term economic future posed by globalisation</strong></h2> <p>William Hague made this point on the Today programme on Wednesday but that doesn't mean it's not true. At Labour's conference very little was said about the impact of competition from China, but figures like Hague and Osborne have been issuing dire warnings about European countries being condemned to poverty if they fail to keep up with the Asian economic superpowers and Cameron is going to say the same thing in his speech later. This case is set out in detail in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Britannia-Unchained-Global-Lessons-Prosperity/dp/1137032235\" title=\"\">Britannia Unchained</a>, a new book by five 2010-intake Tory MPs. It's a key text in the party at the moment although, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/09/britannia-unhinged-young-tory-right-set-out-their-stall\" title=\"\">as my colleague Paul Owen found when he attended a Britannia Unchained fringe, some of its conclusions are unpalatable</a>.</p> <h2><strong>5. Boris Johnson is the most potent force in Conservative politics (maybe even British politics) but he has postponed a challenge to David Cameron</strong></h2> <p>Johnson's reception at Birmingham was extraordinary \u2013 even Bill Clinton at Labour in 2002 failed to generate so much excitement \u2013 and, through some unholy alchemy involving ego, wit, optimism and good cheer, he has become a figure who transcends party politics. He said nothing incompatible with white van Conservatism, but his speech was the most uplifting we've heard all week because it was relentlessly positive. Johnson was loyal to Cameron, and insisted he would not try to get elected to parliament before 2016, although, with glorious chutzpah, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/09/boris-johnson-conservative-party-conference-live#block-5073fb1058f91d7bbadac14a\" title=\"\">he actually included a joke in his conference speech about how he sometimes breaks his promises</a>. Cameron should be worried. But Labour should worry about Johnson too.</p> <h2><strong>6. Cameron has averted a rebellion over Europe</strong></h2> <p>Europe was tipped as a conference flashpoint, but, although the subject kept coming up in fringe meetings, there were no public rows. Cameron has come closer to announcing a referendum on the EU, and, broadly, his party seems happy with this.</p> <h2><strong>7. Council tax increases have become politically unpalatable \u2013 which suggests the system is bust</strong></h2> <p>In one of the most expensive announcements of the week (although one which received relatively little media attention), the Tories announced that they will fund a council-tax freeze for another year. In Scotland the SNP also refuses to sanction council-tax increases. Taxpayers benefit in the short term, but councillors find central interference of this kind infuriating and it means that the existing local-government funding model is becoming unworkable.</p> <h2><strong>8. Internal Conservative party modernisation has stalled</strong></h2> <p>The Labour MP Phil Wilson once said Labour won an election on 1 May 1997 and stopped reforming the party on 2 May 1997. The same thing has happened to the Conservative party since 2010. What has happened to the A-list? Or to open primaries? There have also been complaints about the efficiency of the party machine and having a party chairman who has spent the week avoiding jibes about Michael Green hasn't helped either.</p> <h2><strong>9. Andrew Mitchell will find it hard to hang on as chief whip</strong></h2> <p>If he thought that by avoiding the conference he could make the controversy about his anti-police rant blow over, he was wrong. When he appeared on a video shown at the Johnson rally on Monday night, members cheered ironically, as if he were an object of derision. For reasons that <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/graemearcher/100184381/what-do-tory-activists-want-how-about-an-end-to-the-smug-upper-class-stereotype-andrew-mitchell-embodies/\" title=\"\">Graeme Archer explains quite well on his Telegraph blog</a>, the conference has illustrated just how much damage Mitchell has done to the party and there are now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frasernelson/status/255831457518481408\" title=\"\">strong suggestions</a> that he will soon resign.</p> <h2><strong>10. The Conservatives are not optimistic about their prospects in the police commissioner elections</strong></h2> <p>Next month most voters in England and Wales will get the chance to take part in what is virtually a nationwide poll. You would expect the party to be on full election alert. But, generally, the Tories have not been showcasing their candidates and the elections only received a modest slot in the conference programme. That suggests expectations are low. The Tories have also written off Corby, which is why Louise Mensch was loudly booed when she appeared in a video at the Johnson rally.</p>",

As Daniel Chamovitz shows in his recent, delightful book <a href=\"http://www.whataplantknows.com/\" title=\"\">What a Plant Knows</a>, greater understanding of the complex and subtle capabilities of plants challenges us not only to think in new ways about sight, sound and smell and what a plant is, but also what we are.</p> <h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780199538065\" title=\"\"><strong>Walden by Henry David Thoreau</strong></a> (1854)</h2> <p>Whether examining tiny bubbles in a sheet of ice over shallow water at close range or considering the most notable men and women of the day as \"transient and fleeting phenomena\", Thoreau's meditation beside Walden Pond sparkles with surprises and insights. The land ethic articulated by <a href=\"http://www.aldoleopold.org/AldoLeopold/almanac.shtml\" title=\"\">Aldo Leopold in A Sand County Almanac</a> and the visionary transport of <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Pilgrim_at_Tinker_Creek.html?id=e_Na1k1CoR8C&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</a> (both also essential reading) are prefigured here, as are elements of the radical, progressive and compassionate agenda of environmentalism at its best. \"We are acquainted with a mere pellicle of the globe on which we live,\" writes Thoreau, \"We know not where we are.\" Walden remains an essential companion on the journey of discovery.</p> <h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780140439120\" title=\"\"><strong>On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin</strong></a> (1859)</h2> <p>One of the masterworks of civilisation. It shows how, when sufficient pain is taken, precise observation and close reasoning can, cumulatively, lead to a revolution in our view of nature of world-historical significance. The reality into which Darwin plunges us is bracing \u2013 \"the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life\" \u2013 but refreshing too.</p> <p>There's no denying that much of the Origin is a far-from-easy read \u2013 \"..as the chelae of Crustaceans resemble in some degree the avicularia of Polyzoa, both serving as pincers, it may be worth while to show that the with the former a long series of serviceable gradations still exists...\" \u2013 but it is absolutely worth the effort. (The annotated edition, edited by <a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674060173\" title=\"\">James T Costa</a>, is a help). \"We see through the eyes of theory,\" writes the physicist <a href=\"http://193.189.74.53/~qubitor/people/david/David.html\" title=\"\">David Deutsch</a>, quoting Karl Popper. Darwin opened new eyes to see the world in all its gore and beauty.</p> <h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780521437769\" title=\"\"><strong>On Growth and Form by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson</strong></a> (1917)</h2> <p>D'Arcy sought to understand living and natural forms through geometry, number and the optimal representation of physical forces: a theory that is, in the words of Stephen Jay Gould, \"a strange hybrid of Pythagoras and Newton\". With its fascinating illustrations of transformation and fine prose, this pioneering work is, among other things, a ringing celebration of what Pliny called Magna <em>ludentis naturae varietas</em>, \"the great variety of nature at play\", and it continues to inspire artists, scientists and nature lovers.</p> <h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007457465\" title=\"\"><strong>A Land by Jacquetta Hawkes</strong></a> (1951)</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/11/rereading-a-land-jacquetta-hawkes\" title=\"\">Robert Macfarlane has described this book</a> in ways that cannot be bettered: \"It appears at different points to be a short history of Planet England; a geological prose-poem; a Cretaceous cosmi-comedy; a patriotic hymn of love to Terra Britannica; a neo-Romantic vision of the countryside as a vast and inadvertent work of land-art; [and] a speculative account of human identity as chthonic in origin and collective in nature \u2026 Its tonal range is vast. It possesses echoes of the saga, shades of the epic, and tassels of the New Age. It brinks at times on the bonkers \u2026 I can imagine it reperformed as a rock opera.\"</p> <h2>7. <strong>Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid by James Watson and Francis Crick</strong> (1953)</h2> <p>Literary types tend to be a little spooked by scientific papers. Pity. We should at least make an effort, if only as a Labrador does when, sensing that something important is going on without quite understanding what, it howls along to the sound of a piano. Watson and Crick's paper on the structure of DNA is a good place to start. This magnificent insight into the staggering beauty at the heart of life is fractionally over a page in length. Its consequences are huge but, as we increasingly appreciate thanks to the ENCODE project and more, even now we are only a few small steps towards understanding how life works. <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnature%2Fdna50%2Fwatsoncrick.pdf&amp;ei=UT91UIDvJ-rR0QWht4GABw&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7s-1Cvzjp3jrfJS6rMPgV_ed9cQ&amp;sig2=psL3NMNClE_Q_TQLQBJ9Hg\" title=\"\">Download it and stick it on your wall [PDF]</a>.</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007455935\" title=\"\"><strong>The Lorax by Dr Seuss</strong></a> (1971)</h2> <p>The Gospel according to Theodore Seuss Geisel tells you all need to know: \"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better.

Few if any have matched Thomas, a physician who died in 1993 leaving six collections of essays. The Lives of a Cell, dating from around the time of the first photograph of the Earth from space and the discovery that whale song consists of complex organised patterns, is among the best. \"We are not the masters of nature that we thought ourselves; we are as dependent on the rest of nature as are the leaves or midges or fish.\" And again, \"We are alive against \u2026 stupendous odds \u2026 You'd think we'd never stop dancing.\"</p> <h2>10. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781860465833\" title=\"\"><strong>Arctic Dreams by Barry Lopez</strong></a><strong> </strong>(1984)</h2> <p>It's taken until the last slot to get to a book that is by most definitions \"proper nature writing\" in the sense of sustained descriptive writing about the natural world affectionately satirised by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/01/william-boot-evelyn-waugh\" title=\"\">Evelyn Waugh in Scoop</a> with \"Feather-footed through the plashy fen passes the questing vole\". But Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape is the real McCoy: a work of tremendous ambition that combines description of natural forms and processes in an environment that is among the bleakest and richest on Earth with profound thought on human dwelling and alienation. Arctic Dreams is all the more remarkable in that, though published less than 30 years ago, the spectre of human made climate change is absent from its pages.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781847081728\" title=\"\">Caspar Henderson's The Book of Barely Imagined Beings</a> is published by Granta</p>",

Scientists knew that hormones such as adrenalin had powerful effects: increasing blood pressure and making the heart beat faster. They suspected that cell surfaces contained some kind of recipient for hormones. But what these receptors actually consisted of and how they worked remained obscured for most of the 20th Century.</p> <p>Cells in our body are constantly exposed to a variety of chemical signals\u2014hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, and sometimes even drugs\u2014that they need to interpret and translate into a response. This task is handled by receptors that dot cell membranes. Lefkowitz essentially defined the field of receptor biology through his work with G protein\u2013coupled receptors, the largest and most pervasive family of cell receptors. A thousand or more of these receptors are known to exist throughout the body, playing critical roles in sight, smell, and taste, and in regulating heart rate, blood pressure, pain tolerance, glucose metabolism, and virtually all known physiological processes.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1531c47b-52cb-41a0-a447-7a60e02e2eb7\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349879898434/Chemistry-Nobel-prizewinn-010.jpg\" alt=\"Chemistry Nobel prizewinner Robert Lefkowitz in his lab\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lefkowitz in his lab at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, in 1996.

They are fundamental to regulation of many physiological processes, from the nervous system to taste and smell.

And people proposed that there must be specific receptors on the surface of cells which looked for materials that would then modify the cell behaviour or cell signalling or whatever. But until Lefkowitz and Kobilka came along nobody actually had isolated these things, so their real triumph very early on was to show that you could isolate these sensors and what they sensed. And what they sense is actually quite staggering. They sense light \u2026 flavour, smell, adrenaline, which of course is hugely important because when adrenaline is there your heart rate increases and your pulse rate increases and your blood pressure increases and that's the fight or flight response that all animals get. Histamine is sensed that way, and that's important in allergy; dopamine is sensed that way, and that's important in cell transmission and used in treating Parkinson's for example; serotonin, which affects how you sense light and dark and regulate the body that way. And it's true that half of all medications achieve their effect through G-protein-coupled receptors.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hear the full interview below.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/999482-interview-with-professor-david-phillips-immediate-past-president-of-the-royal-society-of-chemistry-about-the-2012-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-winners-robert-lefkowitz-and-brian-kobilka#t=2m56s\"> <object data=\"http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf\" height=\"129\" id=\"boo_embed_999482\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"></param><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf\"></param><param name=\"scale\" value=\"noscale\"></param><param name=\"salign\" value=\"lt\"></param><param name=\"bgColor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"></param><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"window\"></param><param name=\"FlashVars\" value=\"mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F999482-interview-with-professor-david-phillips-immediate-past-president-of-the-royal-society-of-chemistry-about-the-2012-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-winners-robert-lefkowitz-and-brian-kobilka.mp3%3Fkeyed%3Dtrue%26source%3Dembed&amp;mp3Title=Interview+with+Professor+David+Phillips%2C+immediate+past-president+of+the+Royal+Society+of+Chemistry+about+the+2012+Nobel+prize+in+chemistry+winners%2C+Robert+Lefkowitz+and+Brian+Kobilka&amp;mp3Time=10.46am+10+Oct+2012&amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F999482-interview-with-professor-david-phillips-immediate-past-president-of-the-royal-society-of-chemistry-about-the-2012-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-winners-robert-lefkowitz-and-brian-kobilka&amp;mp3Author=iansample&amp;rootID=boo_embed_999482\"></param><a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/999482-interview-with-professor-david-phillips-immediate-past-president-of-the-royal-society-of-chemistry-about-the-2012-nobel-prize-in-chemistry-winners-robert-lefkowitz-and-brian-kobilka.mp3?keyed=true&amp;source=embed\">Interview with Professor David Phillips, immediate past-president of the Royal Society of Chemistry about the 2012 Nobel prize in chemistry winners, Robert Lefkowitz and Brian Kobilka (mp3)</a></object> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-10T11:09:43.956Z\">at 12.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507550a0c0e361310bc6cb3f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-10T10:40:46.934Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ffea2059-6418-40be-b7d2-8950d60747bd\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349865378033/Chemistry-Nobel-prizewinn-010.jpg\" alt=\"Chemistry Nobel prizewinner Robert Lefkowitz\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Lefkowitz of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

Here, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110824/full/476387a.html\">from the journal Nature</a>, is an impressive profile of a man who is clearly not keen on talking to the press. A telling par from that profile:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The latest accomplishment has many in the field buzzing about a Nobel prize. \"But if they do give it to him, it'll be the devil to get him to Stockholm,\" says Henry Bourne, a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco, who worked on G proteins and has known Kobilka since the 1980s. Kobilka loathes the limelight, and is renowned as much for his shy modesty as his ability to crack seemingly impossible protein structures. When I met Kobilka at his Stanford office, he accepted a quick handshake, averting his eyes, and reluctantly offered me a seat across from him at his desk. He stared anxiously at the glowing red light on my voice recorder. He is \"desperately fearful\" of talking to the press, he says, his voice breaking, and only agreed to talk because he \"wanted to make sure that the contributions of my lab and collaborators are recognized\".</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d96418b7-a326-4a21-8724-d35de7cb2686\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349879066610/Chemistry-Nobel-prizewinn-010.jpg\" alt=\"Chemistry Nobel prizewinner Brian Kobilka\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kobilka speaks on the phone at his home in Palo Alto after hearing he has been awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry.

Each cell has tiny receptors that enable it to sense its environment, so it can adapt to new situtations. <strong>Robert Lefkowitz </strong>and <strong>Brian Kobilka </strong>are awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for groundbreaking discoveries that reveal the inner workings of an important family of such receptors: G-protein\u2013coupled receptors.</p> </blockquote> <p>and some more:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For a long time, it remained a mystery how cells could sense their environment. Scientists knew that hormones such as adrenalin had powerful effects: increasing blood pressure and making the heart beat faster. They suspected that cell surfaces contained some kind of recipient for hormones. But what these receptors actually consisted of and how they worked remained obscured for most of the 20th Century.</p> <p>Lefkowitz started to use radioactivity in 1968 in order to trace cells' receptors. He attached an iodine isotope to various hormones, and thanks to the radiation, he managed to unveil several receptors, among those a receptor for adrenalin: \u03b2-adrenergic receptor. His team of researchers extracted the receptor from its hiding place in the cell wall and gained an initial understanding of how it works.</p> <p>The team achieved its next big step during the 1980s. The newly recruited Kobilka accepted the challenge to isolate the gene that codes for the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor from the gigantic human genome. His creative approach allowed him to attain his goal. When the researchers analyzed the gene, they discovered that the receptor was similar to one in the eye that captures light. They realized that there is a whole family of receptors that look alike and function in the same manner.</p> <p>Today this family is referred to as G-protein\u2013coupled receptors. About a thousand genes code for such receptors, for example, for light, flavour, odour, adrenalin, histamine, dopamine and serotonin. About half of all medications achieve their effect through G-protein\u2013coupled receptors.</p> <p>The studies by Lefkowitz and Kobilka are crucial for understanding how G-protein\u2013coupled receptors function. Furthermore, in 2011, Kobilka achieved another break-through; he and his research team captured an image of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor at the exact moment that it is activated by a hormone and sends a signal into the cell. This image is a molecular masterpiece \u2013 the result of decades of research.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507544d3c0e361310bc6cb2a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-10T09:50:11.838Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Winners announced</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This year's chemistry Nobel prize winners have been announced:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hhmi.org/research/investigators/lefkowitz_bio.html\">Robert J.

  "<p>The UK has announced that \u00a335m ($56m) in aid over the next three years will be aimed at improving nutrition for mothers and children in Yemen amid fears that a hunger crisis will derail fragile gains in the Middle East's poorest country.</p> <p>The funding is the first new initiative from the UK's \u00a3196m support programme to Yemen, unveiled recently at a donor conference in Saudi Arabia. More than 10 million people in Yemen, a country with a population of around 24.7 million, are thought to be at risk because of insufficient food. In the worst-affected parts of the country, as many as one in three children are suffering from life-threatening acute malnutrition.</p> <p>Yemen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/22/tackle-malnutrition-yemen-unicef\" title=\"\">has been neglected by aid donors for years</a>, but things have changed since Ali Abdullah Saleh \u2013 following months of protests \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/23/yemen-president-quits\" title=\"\">stood down as president last November</a> after 33 years in power. The country is undergoing a difficult democratic transition under President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who was elected in February after an agreement signed by opposing factions last November on a transitional settlement.</p> <p>Saleh's departure has prompted donors to pledge $7.8bn in aid after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/06/money-yemen-humanitarian-crisis\" title=\"\">donor conferences in Riyadh</a> and, most recently, New York. The \u00a335m in UK aid was announced by Alan Duncan, the international development minister, during a visit to Sana'a, the Yemeni capital, on Tuesday. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/sep/28/uk-aid-yemen-saves-lives-promote-stability\" title=\"\">Duncan has been heavily involved in securing international commitments to support Yemen</a> as it seeks to turn the page on decades of authoritarian rule.</p> <p>\"Yemen has been forgotten as it's been too hot to handle,\" Duncan said in a telephone interview from Yemen. \"The transition has unlocked the situation.\" The minister added, however, that the world must take long-term action to tackle malnutrition before it becomes a \"death sentence for tens of thousands\".</p> <p>\"The funding pledges made at the Friends of Yemen meeting two weeks ago were a vital step forward, but donors must make good on these promises and show that they're standing by Yemen for the long haul,\" he said. \"The launch of this major new programme shows that the UK is serious about commitments made in Riyadh and New York, but others must now follow this lead and provide predictable, long-term funding. Without that, agencies can't commit to tackling the root causes of malnutrition in case their funding is stopped halfway through, resulting in time and money down the drain and more lives lost.\"</p> <p>The UK funding will go towards long-term support to help improve nutrition for 1.65 million women and children in 60 of the most vulnerable, deprived and conflict-affected districts in the eight governorates where the need is greatest.</p> <p>Geert Cappelaere, Yemen representative for Unicef, the UN children's agency, said the UK Department for International Development's money would ensure predictable funding for the next three years.</p> <p>\"We can now act farther and faster in tackling not only the immediate, short-term needs of those suffering from undernutrition, but also in addressing the root causes behind this. This ensures a more concerted and holistic response that looks at strengthening the health system to deliver an integrated package of health and nutrition interventions, provision of water, hygiene and sanitation services, as well as addressing issues around education and child protection that can help to prevent undernutrition among children under five.\"</p> <p>NGOs including Oxfam and Islamic Relief have urged donors not to repeat the mistakes of the past, when they failed to deliver on pledges. In 2006, $5bn was promised but in early 2010 less than 10% had been disbursed. The NGOs called on the Friends of Yemen to ensure a comprehensive strategy, and accountable and transparent plan spelling out how the money would be spent and by when, with clear indicators that national and international civil society could monitor.</p>",

And in any given month we have up to 200m people playing our games,\" Stalbow said during an appearance at the MIPCOM conference in Cannes.</p> <p>As a comparison, social games giant Zynga has 306m monthly active users across all of its games, according to its <a href=\"http://company.zynga.com/news/press-releases/hasbro-brings-popular-zyngar-brands-life-new-line-games\">most recent press release</a>.</p> <p>He was speaking days after the announcement of Rovio's partnership with LucasFilm for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/08/angry-birds-star-wars-announced\">Angry Birds Star Wars</a>, which is due to launch on 8 November as a mobile game, merchandise range and suite of board games.</p> <p>The deal has been in the making for about a year. \"We took a step back as an organisation and thought which brand would we really like Angry Birds to partner with,\" said Stalbow. \"Collectively, we're all massive Star Wars fans at the company.\"</p> <p>Rovio is also trying to spin off new franchises from Angry Birds, most notably with the recent release of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/sep/26/bad-piggies-angry-birds-review\">Bad Piggies</a>, its first game focusing purely on the pig characters from the previous games.</p> <p>\"It's a really nice way to start building a new franchise by extending something out of our core game,\" said Stalbow, noting that it had taken just three hours after its release for Bad Piggies to top the charts on Apple's App Store.</p> <p>\"You'll see a lot of focus from us in the next year on expanding the Bad Piggies franchise.\"</p> <p>Rovio is also preparing to launch a series of 52 Angry Birds animated shorts, with Stalbow showing a preview clip that seemingly showed the series being branded as Angry Birds Toons. The company now has 80 animators working in-house at its Helsinki headquarters.</p> <p>The distribution for the shorts remains unclear. \"We're in discussions with various different broadcast partners,\" said Stalbow, although he also confirmed that Rovio is weighing up alternative distribution models, including YouTube's Original Channels initiative.</p> <p>\"It's up to us over the next few weeks as we launch our series to figure out the best way to bring the content to market through digital channels,\" said Stalbow.</p> <p>\"Right now, we're trying to make some very important decisions and some strategic bets on partners we can really grow with over the next five years.\"</p> <p>Stalbow hinted that plans for a longform Angry Birds movie have not been shelved, despite a lack of announcements on that score since it was first rumoured a couple of years ago.</p> <p>\"Hollywood has seen the success that Angry Birds has had, and Hollywood is hot for our brand, and hot for working with us on many different levels,\" he said. \"For us, the shortform series is just the start of our plans in animation.\"</p> <p>Rovio has regularly been compared \u2013 most often by the company's own executives \u2013 to early Disney. However, Stalbow says other global brands are providing inspiration as Rovio mulls its future strategy.</p> <p>\"We're looking at some incredible other brands out there and learning from what they've done. If you look at how Hello Kitty has evolved, or Super Mario... It's about trying to have an impact on pop culture,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Bank and mining shares are moving higher but this has done little to lift the general caution pervading the market.</p> <p><strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> has been lifted 1.37p to 38.375p while <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> has risen 6.5p to 263.8p ahead of the flotation of its Direct Line business. Analyst Marcus Barnard at Oriel Securities is not exactly enthused by the insurance spin-off, however. With reports that the price range for Direct Line has been narrowed from 160p-195p to 170p-177.5p, he said:</p> <blockquote> This lowering of the range is in hardly surprising given current conditions, but cannot be seen as good news for RBS. The top of the new price range is the mid point of the old range, suggesting lack lustre demand from investors at anything other than a low price. <br> But even at this lower price we feel this offering is hardly compelling, when compared to other insurers such as RSA. </blockquote> <p>Part of the boost to banking shares - and <strong>Barclays</strong> is also higher, rising 2.95p to 224.5p - is the renewed reports of a decision by the Financial Services Authority to relax capital and liquidity rules to stimulate lending.</p> <p>Meanwhile the mining sector has been lifted by better than expected third quarter figures from Alcoa, which began the US reporting season last night. However the aluminium producer echoed recent concerns about a slowdown in China, a key market for commodity companies.</p> <p>Still, <strong>Anglo American</strong> has added 23p to 1836.5p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> has risen 14.5p to 3044.5p.</p> <p>Overall, after the IMF did its bit for negativity by cutting its global growth forecasts, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is down another 12.12 points at 5798.13. The never-ending eurozone crisis also continued to undermine sentiment, with investors no clearer about a number of key issues, including a possible Spanish bailout. The protests against German chancellor Angela Merkel's presence in Athens has also not helped.</p> <p>A number of companies have seen their shares go ex-dividend, including <strong>Smith and Nephew</strong>, down 18p at 654.5p, and <strong>Wolseley</strong>, 40p lower at \u00a326.47. Smith and Nephew has also been hit by a sell recommendation from Societe Generale. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> Given that we see downside risk to the consensus earnings per share forecasts, that we find the valuation unappealing, and that Smith &amp; Nephew has not executed well on M&amp;A in the past, we are initiating coverage with a sell rating. We are aware that a few upside risks exist, but if they do materialise, they are unlikely to alter our bearish view until 2014. <br> </blockquote> <p>It said the company's research and development programme would take longer than expected to mitigate pressure on prices, while the benefits of its restructuring plans would not entirely offset the cost of its investment programme. It added:</p> <blockquote> If [a] planned US medical device tax does materialise, there will be a further 4% downside to our 2013-2017 earnings per share estimates. <br> Finally, we note that Smith &amp; Nephew is considering an accretive acquisition or buyback. However, given recent management changes, we would not be surprised if this decision gets delayed until 2014. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Man</strong> has been on a rocky ride in recent times on worries about its future growth, but sporadically, bid speculation gives the hedge fund manager's shares a lift.</p> <p>With revived talk of a possible bid from US shareholder Blackrock and others, Man has jumped 3.45p to 93.4p.</p>",
  "<p>A world-wide group of editors has raised the alarm about a press freedom crisis in Argentina where the government is planning to break up the country's leading independent media group.</p> <p>The Paris-based Global Editors' Network (GEN) is calling on the world's media to focus attention on a decision by the administration of President Cristina Kirchner to seize control of Grupo Clar\u00edn on 7 December. </p> <p>It is using a controversial media law in order to revoke its licences and sell off its assets. Yet the law itself is currently being challenged in the courts on the grounds that it violates constitutional rights.</p> <p>The Clar\u00edn group publishes Argentina's largest-selling newspaper, Clar\u00edn, which has been a consistently critical voice of the Kirchner government.<br> After a meeting of the GEN board in Buenos Aires this week, its secretary, Alejandro Mir\u00f3 Quesada, said: \"7 December is a deadline day for press freedom. Media should speak with one voice against this intolerable threat to independent journalism. </p> <p>\"The attack on Clar\u00edn is symbolic of the political pressure that media are facing throughout the region.\" </p> <p>The Kirchner move follows a three-year campaign by her government against the Clar\u00edn group, the details of which have been reported previously by the three leading global press freedom watchdogs (<a href=\"http://www.freemedia.at/home/singleview/article/ipi-condemns-argentine-governments-attacks-on-grupo-clarin.html\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/2011/02/attacks-on-the-press-2010-argentina.php\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/report-argentina,166.html\">here</a>). </p> <p>GEN has also highlighted more than 450 legal and administrative acts of harassment against Clar\u00edn. One key move has been the government's preferential placing of state advertising with certain media companies which, says GEN, \"has effectively bought itself control of media content.\" </p> <p>It is estimated the the Kirchner government now has direct or indirect control of 80% of the Argentine media. </p> <p>As for the media law, it was supposed to strengthen diversity and pluralism by limiting monopoly media ownership - a legitimate goal - but its critics say it has only one intention: to stifle dissent and, in particular, to dismantle the Clar\u00edn group.</p> <p>Even though it remains uncertain whether the Kirchner government will carry out its threat, GEN is organising an international petition and calling on media leaders from the region, and around the world, to protest. </p> <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> GEN was founded in March 2011 in response to concerns about the risks to the future of quality journalism. Its 400 members are drawn from editors and executives in 80 countries. The president is Ricardo Kirschbaum, Clar\u00edn's editor-in-chief, and one of <a href=\"http://www.globaleditorsnetwork.org/board-members/\">the 24-strong board members</a> is The Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger. </p> <p><em>Sources:</em> GEN/<a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/report-argentina,166.html\">Reporters Without Borders</a>/<a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/2011/02/attacks-on-the-press-2010-argentina.php\">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>/<a href=\"http://www.freemedia.at/home/singleview/article/ipi-condemns-argentine-governments-attacks-on-grupo-clarin.html\">International Press Institute</a></p>",
  "<p>As local authorities come under pressure to reduce their spending, collaboration is one way to protect public services from cuts. The government is encouraging councils to explore opportunities to work with one another, and with the private and voluntary sectors. But there are some very human obstacles that prevent collaboration happening as smoothly as it might.</p> <p>Restructuring and change in the workplace tends to make people focus internally. Protection becomes much more important, and anything new or different is seen as threatening. In that environment, is it reasonable to expect people to openly participate in collaboration? It requires a level of altruism that some may be unable to find if their personal security isn't clear.</p> <p>There's also the matter of trust. Working for the British Red Cross, one of the most trusted and impartial organisations in the world, I am conscious of the great advantage that trustworthiness can bring. But I know that even we don't necessarily seem trustworthy to everyone we might want to work with.</p> <p>Small voluntary organisations almost invariably find the size of much larger partners such as the Red Cross intimidating, and are concerned that may be predators rather than genuine partners. It's little wonder that the different tiers of local government find it so hard to truly collaborate for the benefit of the community.</p> <p>It's much easier to call for innovation than to actually create a psychological atmosphere where innovation can thrive. In councils where elected leaders and chief executives champion collaboration it will happen. Often that steer isn't clear enough, however, and people at lower tiers within the local authority may not feel they have the necessary permission or level of responsibility to actively explore a partnership. People to whom innovation comes naturally will probably go ahead and do it anyway, but many will be less willing if it feels like they're sticking their necks out.</p> <p>So how can these human barriers be broken down? Firstly, employees need to be more aware of how and why they might seem untrustworthy to a potential partner. You can't stop people being suspicious of you, but you can anticipate and address their fears upfront.</p> <p>Council staff should be given unambiguous permission to seek out, propose and develop partnerships in their own work, rather than relying on programmes and initiatives that filter down from decision-makers above.</p> <p>And we all need to make sure we're open for business. There are a huge number of potential partners within the private and voluntary sector keen to work with local authorities but unable to fathom the routes into them.</p> <p>It's not just a public sector problem \u2013 I am often asked for advice on how to talk to the voluntary sector. Organisations such as the <a href=\"http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Council for Voluntary Organisations</a> and Councils for Voluntary Services provide support through the government's Transforming Local Infrastructure programme, but we can always make ourselves more available.</p> <p>If it's easier to start a conversation with one another, it will be easier to help each other overcome some of the biggest questions faced by public services.</p> <p><em>Jane Roberts is operations director at the </em><a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/Where-we-work/In-the-UK/South-Eastern-England/Kent-and-Sussex\" title=\"\"><em>British Red Cross in Kent and Sussex</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>David Cameron will seek to prevent Ed Miliband's \"one nation\" Labour driving him from the common ground of British politics on Wednesday, asserting that his brand of compassionate Conservatism is not just for the strong, but also the best way to help the poor, the weak and the vulnerable.</p> <p>Despite a conference full of tough messages on burglary, welfare and sometimes social issues, the prime minister will insist: \"My mission from the day I became leader was \u2026 to show the Conservative party is for everyone, north or south, black or white, straight or gay.\"</p> <p>In his annual speech to the Conservative party conference, he will tell his party: \"It's not enough to know our ideas are right. We've got to explain why they are compassionate too.\"</p> <p>His aides decline to refer to the political \"centre ground\" arguing that on issues such as welfare, crime and Europe, the common ground is to the right, and in territory long occupied by the Conservatives. He will also refuse to bury the much derided \"big society\" concept in his keynote speech closing the conference season saying his task is \"above all to show Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society\".</p> <p>But on the day after the IMF issued another downgrade of its UK growth forecasts, Cameron will also issue a stark, almost existential, warning to the country, saying unparalleled global forces mean the country is at an hour of reckoning.</p> <p>He will say: \"Unless we act, unless we take difficult decisions, unless we show determination and imagination, Britain may not be the force which it has been in the past. The truth is this we are in a global race today and that means an hour of reckoning for a country like ours \u2013 sink or swim, do or die.\"</p> <p>At the same time, flashes of his trademark optimism will appear, drawing on the revival of the British spirit shown in the Olympic summer.</p> <p>Cameron's aides believe that Miliband's largely insular address to his own party totally failed to address not just the deficit but the scale of competitive challenge facing Britain due to rise of new global powers. He will argue that these forces require tough decisions on spending, welfare, and schools if the strivers working hard are not to feel cheated.</p> <p>The prime minister's aides acknowledge that although Miliband, in personal terms, delivered a strong speech, they estimate he has made two major strategic errors in failing to make tough decisions on the deficit or show a greater willingness to curb the welfare budget.</p> <p>Cameron will say: \"Labour's plans to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and with our future. We're here because they spent too much money and borrowed too much. How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing. I honestly think Labour has not learned a thing.\"</p> <p>George Osborne upped the stakes by claiming a fundamental threat to the free enterprise system now existed, adding to claims made by Cameron that Labour is waging class war.</p> <p>He told a meeting of businessmen in Birmingham: \"Really for the first time in my adult lifetime, up for grabs is the argument about a free enterprise economy.</p> <p>\"That was really resolved I thought at the end of my teenage years when the Berlin Wall fell and all parties and all groups in Britain basically accepted the consensus of the free market economy.</p> <p>\"I would say you just see signs of that being contested, contested because of what's happened in the banking crash, and people are starting to say it's OK for the state to take 50% of the national income, it's OK for the state to tax people 50% of their income, it's actually wrong to challenge vested interests in our education and welfare system.\"</p> <p>In an implicit acknowledgement that the electorate remains confused about his core values, Cameron will reveal more than he has ever done before about his personal background.</p> <p>Cameron will not present himself as a hard luck story, but the son of a man that suffered disability, stigma, loneliness and a broken family. Cameron's father Ian died two years ago aged 77 and had been born with both legs deformed, and endured repeated operations in an attempt to straighten them. \"Because disability in the thirties was such a stigma, he was an only child and probably a lonely child,\" Cameron will say.</p> <p>Challenging those who see the Conservatives as the party of snobs and the rich, he will say: \"There is nothing complicated about me. I believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country\".</p> <p>Cameron found himself under growing pressure over his plans to cut the welfare budget, with Liberal Democrat grassroots bodies demanding that Nick Clegg does not sign up to such measures. They are furious that their plan to raise taxes through a \"mansion tax\" has been thrown out by the chancellor. There is suspicion in Lib Dem circles that Clegg has in broad terms agreed to this level of welfare cuts, something his officials hotly deny.</p> <p>Mark Garnier, a member of the Treasury select committee, said at a fringe event: \"The reason we have a low interest rate is because the economy is absolutely screwed.\" But Cameron rejected a change: \"It's not Plan B that we need, what we are doing is making sure that every part of Plan A is firing on all cylinders.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hard times call for some smart thinking, and my view is that it's well time to make more fruitful use of our underused land. All round Scotland, and in good parts of the UK as well, there's no shortage of unused land which the public own already. </p> <p>There are also plenty of people who are desperate to get hold of land to grow their own healthy, delicious food. In these difficult economic times it makes very little sense to have unused land sitting idle, while people who'd love to use it for productive fruit growing can't. </p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://holyroodappleday.eventbrite.com/\">Holyrood Apple Day</a> at the Scottish parliament last Thursday, MSPs were urged to help sweep away some of the bureaucratic blockages that stand in the way of getting fruit trees planted in our schools, hospital grounds, streets, parks and around public buildings such as the new buildings being constructed for the Commonwealth games in 2014. </p> <p>Our dream is that all our children will experience the pleasure of planting picking and eating some fruit they have grown themselves: our <a href=\"http://www.fruitfulschools.com/fruitfulschools/Welcome.htm\">Fruitful Schools initiative</a> has begun that process, with planting packs of fruit trees and berry plants ideal for school grounds. There has been a boom in school orchard-planting, with about 350 across Scotland now, and the start of a surge in community orchards.</p> <p>We want the next generation to know that food actually grows on trees and doesn't have to come shrink wrapped in plastic. People really love planting and harvesting their own food. It's cheap, good for you, tastes great, and I've yet to find anyone who thinks it's a bad idea. </p> <p>And it's fresh \u2013 if you pick an apple off the tree and we are in the middle of harvest now, it's as fresh and delicious as it can be. You don't need to import fruit from France or Chile if it's growing outside your window in Glasgow. Growing your own saves money, saves carbon, and saves the planet. If everyone agrees that it's a no brainer, why is it so very hard to get land to grow food? </p> <p>In real exasperation we have taken <a href=\"http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/land-for-landless-scots-for-grow-your-own\">a petition to the Scottish parliament</a>, calling for government agencies who hold public land such as Forestry Commission Scotland, the Crown Estate, local authorities, health boards, and big environment groups like the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds to make much more land available for people to plant, and grow their own. </p> <p>We are pleased to get cross party support from the MSPs on the petitions committee. We are also pleased to get lots of support from various public agencies. </p> <p>But what we really don't see is any evidence on the ground that it's any easier for communities and for children to get their hands dirty, to dig holes and to get planting. Fine words are encouraging \u2013 but we need to see this translated into action. </p> <p>Our call is for a \"right to grow\". That would mean that people wanting to grow on unused public land could do so, unless there is a good reason why not. We are not calling for changes in land ownership as much land is already in public ownership. </p> <p>The \"right to grow\" would be rather like the \"right to roam\" which came about after WW2 and now allows access for walkers into the hills. While this was opposed by landowners at the time, it's now the norm and works well. Commercial apple growing has been in decline in Scotland since before the war: there is almost no commercial growing here now.</p> <p>Providing land for food growing, helps people to help themselves. People don't want to sit home and watch daytime TV - they want something useful to do. This is true for people young and old, rich and poor, urban and rural. </p> <p>Being able to go and get your hands dirty and grow things is so important to people. And it's vital that children learn these skills so they know how to feed themselves in what is an uncertain future. It's not a great thought that our children and their children may struggle to feed themselves </p> <p>Growing your own fruit, and food builds confidence and health and without these the country can't recover. The wartime Dig for Victory campaign has lessons for today. Sustainable economic growth clearly isn't a term understood by our economists or bankers, but it's what drives the people who plant community orchards - you plant trees for future generations - not for immediate personal gain. </p> <p>We are in an economic mess and it's time to allow ordinary people to get land to grow, and let them dig us all out of it.</p>",
  "<p>Chinese tourists must spend, spend, spend, during trips to the UK to help lift the country out of recession, according to a report by the British tourist board.</p> <p>VisitBritain says the luxury clothing brand <a href=\"http:///www.burberryplc.com/\" title=\"\">Burberry</a> has played an almost lone hand at wooing high-spending Chinese tourists to the UK.</p> <p>France and Italy have aspirational consumer brands such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Herm\u00e8s, Christian Dior and Prada, the report says, while Germany's reputation is enhanced by its cars and consumer electronics.

  "<p>Britain's status as a safe haven for global investors is temporary and funds will return to their home markets when the eurozone recovers, IMF officials have warned.</p> <p>Capital flight from Spanish and Italian banks has increased demand for UK government bonds as a safe haven asset but demand is forecast to fall when these countries recover, increasing the Treasury's borrowing costs.</p> <p>The warning came as the IMF said in its six-monthly report on global financial stability that volatile stock markets and the dramatic flight of capital out of Spain and Italy are signals that the world economy is less stable than six months ago.</p> <p>The US and Japan could also see government borrowing costs rise should investors switch funds back to the eurozone or panic about their lack of action in bringing down annual government spending deficits.</p> <p>Officials expressed concern governments that have enjoyed safe haven status have become complacent in recent months, with low borrowing costs taking away the urgency for policymakers to make significant reforms.</p> <p>The IMF said eurozone policymakers have made strides to give money markets some certainty but it has proved inadequate and encouraged flights of money from the periphery to northern Europe and countries outside the currency union.</p> <p>Capital flight from Spanish banks totalled \u20ac296bn in the year to June 2012, which equalled 27% of the country's 2011 GDP. Italian banks also haemorrhaged funds: more than \u20ac235bn left Italy's banks to be deposited in northern European financial institutions and banks outside the eurozone, including UK banks.</p> <p>A scheme put forward by the European Central Bank (ECB) to buy government bonds known as outright monetary transactions (OMTs) has so far failed to entice eurozone governments, especially Spain, which is fearful of the conditions attached to the lending scheme.</p> <p>Spain has already rejected a bailout offered under a parallel scheme put together by Brussels, the European Stability Mechanism, saying it was unnecessary.</p> <p>The authors of the report, Peter Dattels and Mathew Jones, said confidence in politicians had waned as each economic initiative failed to unite policymakers.<br>The reports authors also pointed out that Europe's banks, unlike their American counterparts, are still struggling to lend.</p> <p>Dattels said banks remained underfunded and under pressure from a range of concerns, including continued speculation that one or more countries will pull out of the euro.</p> <p>\"Despite significant and continuing efforts of European policymakers, which have been essential in addressing investors' biggest fears, the principal risk remains the euro area crisis,\" they said.</p> <p>\"Incremental policymaking has been insufficient to fully allay market tensions despite the recent market rally since the end of July.\"</p> <p>They said problems in the US and Japan could be tackled over the next few years while it was a priority to agree a way forward for the eurozone in the next months.</p> <p>A gulf between rich and poorer nations inside the eurozone was making the situation worse. Even with moves to closer co-operation between eurozone countries, banks in the periphery could be forced to reduced their lending by as much as \u20ac2.8tn, higher than the previous estimate of \u20ac2.6tn in April. A do-nothing policy would lead to a reduction in lending of \u20ac4.5tn.</p> <p>The Washington-based organisation has warned before that the world economy is under threat from an unstable financial system all the time eurozone leaders fail to agree terms for bailouts and monetary easing.</p> <p>ECB boss Mario Draghi has garnered praise for his efforts to protect weaker eurozone countries in case they come under attack from nervous investors. Spain, Italy and Portugal have enjoyed lower interest rates as a result of the ECB's actions that cut borrowing costs. These moves have helped stave off a run on the currency.</p> <p>But Draghi has come under constant fire from politicians in Germany, Finland and Holland for creating unlimited rescue funds that could, they believe, rebound on the ECB.</p> <p>This week the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, said he believed Spain would survive with rescue funds from Brussels, contradicting most investor groups and City analysts who believe Spain can only survive if it accepts support from the EU.</p> <p>The IMF's global stability report argues that badly indebted countries need more support to alleviate the pressure from investors and create an environment that fosters confidence and growth.</p> <p>It says that while decisions are delayed the assets held by banks come under question and shareholders flee to hold safer assets.</p> <p>Banks in the eurozone periphery are known to hold billions of euros of bad debts that have yet to be recognised on their balance sheets.</p> <p>UK, French and German banks are also vulnerable to a downturn in the eurozone through their shareholdings and joint ventures with local banks in the periphery.</p>"
